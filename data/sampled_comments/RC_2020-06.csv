"anime","t5_2qh22","Finished Slayers NEXT last night. While I thought the beginning had a rocky start, I really started to get back into it at the midway point and loved the ending. It's a classic 90s type of ending, but god damned it was satisfying. Lina and Gourry have made it into my top tier ships. Honestly, they're an absolute riot together. One thing that really impressed me about the show, that i didn't realize until the very last episodes was Syphiel and her natural fit in with the rest of the cast. She's a late comer in both seasons, with relatively minor roles, yet meshes with the group as naturally as if she were with them from the beginning. Really the chemistry of all the characters with each other is top notch. The gags get me in stitches, the high triumphs get me hyped, and the crushing defeats make me sad. I'm pretty sure I said this last week, but Slayers really is just a fun fantasy adventure. It's just, fun, and I love it for that.

When Medicare Part D was enacted Billy inserted the provision that said the government wasn't allowed to negotiate prices.

Then he retired and tried to hand off the seat to Billy Jr, who never had a real job in his life. Junior's previous job was lobbying a telecommunications subcommittee on behalf of Bell South. I don't think I need to tell you who chaired that subcommittee.

The voters of LA-3 had other ideas so Junior had to get a real job. Senior took a job with PhARMA, the industry lobbying groip, for a salary of over $1 million a year. But it had nothing to do with the ban on negotiating prices.

Then as a final kicker, in 2009-10 when our TVs were full of fraudulent ads promising us how great healthcare reform would be, guess who bankrolled the propaganda? PhARMA. In return Obama did nothing while lifesaving drug prices skyrocketed.",1590969601

All I said was that the rioters and looters are opportunists who are taking advantage of the message the protestors are trying to convey. 

Riots dont do anything other than encourage the government to take harsher and harsher actions against them.

Protestors actually do something to make a change, perhaps occasionally riots help get the message acrossed faster, but that still doesnt justify them whatsoever. 

The people protesting are good, as them doing that doesnt neccesarily benefit them in any way, but it also doesnt harm anybody else.

While the rioters/looters can benefit greatly from doing so, while it harms and disadvantages other people.

But looting and burning down buildings and all of the violence and stuff is also really bad. Now please correct me if I’ve been misinformed, but people are looting places and burning down places that are run or owned by people who had nothing to do with George’s murder, so they’re being punished for doing nothing. Basically, from what I understand, people are responding to violence with violence. I mean imagine if you owned a small business that you worked really hard on, and you go there tomorrow and the windows were smashed and it was totally looted and all? Wouldn’t you think that’s awful? The violence is hurting people who had nothing to do with George’s murder. It is really really bad.

You should tell the GM that it's interuptive if this other player isnt paying attention and is making the game worse for you, but it's his call to respond to that how he sees fit for his game and your group as a whole. You have the ability to leave if it isn't fun for you anymore with this distracted player.


In the one-shot you want to run, it's your choice. I personally get annoyed but dont say anything when someone is on their phone when it's not their turn because my group is pretty good about listening and making decisions even when a little distracted. But playing a whole other game in the middle of a session is a real dick move from my perspective, and I would not let any player who couldn't stop and play along with the group stay.

You're not being too bossy your just asking for players to show some interest in the story and all the work you put in for the session, if they don't want to do that then they shouldn't play in that group.

Time travel is one of it's most powerful weapons, so I'm just jumping to the next most logical conclusion, either if skynet had concluded it is going to lose (or it already had lost but had contingency plans in place) it would most likely try to do as much damage as possible.

"Enough_Sanders_Spam","t5_3fmhe","Ms. Reade was work-shopping the book in a writing group that included Don Rogers, the publisher of the local newspaper, The Union. After Lucy Flores, a former Nevada politician, published an essay recounting an uncomfortable encounter with Mr. Biden — he squeezed her shoulders and kissed the back of her head during an event, she wrote — Ms. Reade informed Mr. Rogers she had her own story to share.

That story, she told The Union, was about “power and control” in an abusive workplace. “I wasn’t scared of him, that he was going to take me in a room or anything,” she told The Associated Press.

And a friend who said she heard of Ms. Reade’s complaint at the time — she worked for Senator Edward M. Kennedy but now supports President Trump — told Vox that Mr. Biden “never tried to kiss” Ms. Reade, and “never went for one of those touches.”

Ms. Reade’s account was in line with other public complaints against Mr. Biden and did not get wide coverage.

Yet she came under harsh attack online. Mr. Biden’s defenders dug into her digital history and, upon finding her praise of Mr. Putin and her Quora page, would use that — with no substantive evidence — to suggest she was a Russian plant. Ms. Reade taunted them, in turn.

Working with her friend Ms. Dale, she produced a comic video of a mock interview in which she denied being a Russian spy while speaking in a bad Russian accent and being offered a lunch of vodka and caviar.

Behind the scenes, there was new trouble. Ms. Reade had begun working as a field supervisor for the Census Bureau, but she left after clashing with superiors, whom she accused in a formal complaint of creating a hostile work environment and discriminating against her.

Her online embrace of Russia seemed only to intensify. After the release of the Mueller report documenting Russian meddling in 2016, Ms. Reade posted an essay that decried xenophobia and opened with the Putin spokesman Dmitri Peskov quoting a proverb: “It is very hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it is not there.”

She was also finding common cause with Mr. Biden’s detractors on the left, many of whom supported Bernie Sanders and believed Russia had been unfairly maligned in coverage of the Mueller investigation.

Among them was Katie Halper, a left-leaning podcast host. It was on Ms. Halper’s show that Ms. Reade made the assault allegation.

This time, her story moved toward center stage, fodder in the online political wars.

Mr. Biden denied her allegation even as he defended her right to be heard, while his defenders took to Facebook and Twitter to highlight the change in her account and emerging accusations of deceit from her friends.

Republicans in turn accused Democrats of hypocritically ignoring the “believe women” battle cry of the #MeToo movement even as they gave a pass to the two dozen allegations of harassment and abuse lodged against Mr. Trump.

Ms. Reade, deluged with messages of encouragement and threat, was by turns timorous and combative.

She gained and then lost a high-profile lawyer, Mr. Wigdor, but quickly procured the pro bono services of a lesser-known consumer protection and civil rights lawyer, Daniel Hornal.

When The Times approached her to discuss details of this article, she referred reporters to Maria Villena, her public relations consultant, who asked for written questions. After The Times submitted them, the actress and #MeToo activist Rose McGowan posted them on Twitter, as an example, she said, of the newspaper’s “tactics.”

Ms. Reade also put The Times in touch with a number of supporters. Among them was a law school classmate, Joseph Backholm, who said she had told him about an assault by an unnamed senator when they were students together. Mr. Backholm has run an organization in Washington State that opposes same-sex marriage and has received funding from local donors to Mr. Trump.

Ultimately, Ms. Reade responded in a string of emails and text messages.

“By coming forward about Joe Biden,” she wrote on Friday, “I have lost everything again, my job, my housing and my reputation. I have been called every vile name imaginable and presented as a monster by the media for daring to speak about Joe Biden and what happened. But I am free.”",1590969604

"blackcats","t5_2twpw","I just passed the one year anniversary of finding my black kitty after he was lost for 6 weeks. He too had never been outside except for once in 2012 where he was lost for 3 weeks. In 2012 he found his way back to food left on the porch, but last year was a different neighborhood and he was living about 3 blocks away around a house that fed their outdoor cats. In the end it was people who had my number, spotted a black cat, and called me to investigate that were the reason I found him. They had my phone number because of either the signs I posted, or the ""pet amber alert"" I paid for. It was pricey, but the nearest 500 homes received a call, description, and my contact info.

"LittleFiresEverywhere","t5_glh8x","Right. They're playing to an audience, and that audience has always and should always include you (the LGBTQ community). 

Conversely, I actually felt like this was one of the first shows I've watched where this inclusion seemed pretty normal/natural (I watch a lot of period/BBC stuff normally so there's not much solid representation). While the age thing/power difference is cause for concern, I actually think as a straight person I was more uncomfortable with the idea of someone just *realizing they are gay* like that, naturally (or maybe before that point, but still pretty organic). 

That's the kind of ingrained homophobia/problematic thinking that's hard to recognize in ones self and deal with societally. But I think the producers purposely did it that way, and that when people are uncomfortable with this scene, unconscious ideas about what a relationship should be are at the root, more than the predatory aspect...

I did say I would tip higher, to one of them, and I said a specific amount to the other. I also said I'd understand if they have to leave it downstairs but I genuinely cannot get it and no hard feelings, and I guess this last part helped a lot in not seeming like a dick even if I am a dick according to some. They took a while so I think they both just took the stairs, I didn't even mention taking the stairs as an option.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;Attractive does not denote good..

Good thing it doesn't say attractive then! The word is something like ""desire"". Better still, what desired the fruit? Her eye. In the Hebrew Bible, doing what you wanted is called ""doing what is right in your own eyes"".

Better still, the Hebrew word for tree is ""eyts"". The Hebrew word for ""counsel"", as in, a teaching, is ""eytsah"".

Just read the verse: 

""When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.""

Take note of each step: she saw it was **good** for food, it was **pleasing** to the eye, and **desirable** for gaining wisdom.

So you've got the woman's moral sense desiring a fruit that gives one wisdom. That sounds pretty close to what OP is saying...

Honestly, this is slightly more complicated than you're making it out to be. If you follow it through, you end up landing on a position that's near ""This is a story using myth and imagery to convey the human status"".

Swearing at me and getting angry doesn't do anything to bolster your position, it just makes you look childish. I would engage with what's being said, or just leave the topic alone.

I think that if the entire display-system were (a) PostScript and (b) part of a integrated/foundational system \[think IBM’S SOM\] — this would allow the PostScript+display-engine to be exposed to the GUI-system.

&gt;It'd might be great and work just fine, possibly for a niche programming language that wouldn't be a problem, but everyone seems to go towards HTML/XML or other ML based GUI building. Actually, I'm interested to know what do you think of this trend.

HTML and XML are a poor serialization-format. The record-format that Delphi used \[DCR. IIRC\] was slightly nicer…but what we actually want is the base-metaobject mentioned above to have an ASN.1 serialization/deserialization method, this would allow us to ‘feed’ the GUI-description directly to the PostScript-engine… or to other GUI-frameworks. (The XER and JER encodings could also possibly, be used as a sort of intermediary between current XML and JSON descriptions — but the main thing here is to allow the description of the GUI-construction to be in the form that is best suited to the application at hand: whether that’s editing or sending across the wire for a light-client / server system.)

&gt;Personally, I blame popularity of JavaScript as the reason and tendency to push it everywhere all the time, even if it doesn't belong somewhere (Instill believe Electron is a stupid idea)

Honestly, Flash was a lot better than Electron. (I would argue it still is, but there’s a whole “newer is always better” continent in this industry.)

One of the big problems with JavaScript is the dynamic-typing and implicit-conversion: this disallows good type-checking; the historic lack of modules is also a huge detractor here; third, the lack of distribution… all of these combine together to make a language/environment that is honestly quite ill-suited to UI. (There’s no real VCL for JavaScript; though there was a VCL for the Web some years ago.) — The sort of thin-client idea previously mentioned could have events that fire ‘pre-server’, ‘on-server’, and ‘post-server’ thereby allowing for some easy distributed GUI/data-processing.

"roblox","t5_2rnsh","I would suggest choosing something to work on in the Studio that could toss in some different aspects of development that you would like to learn. Even if it’s not the focus of the project, if you manage to have fun while you experiment with it, it’ll be very beneficial for expanding the capabilities you have.

You should try to take inspiration from things that interest you and attempt your best to use your current knowledge/what you're learning on the way to create something related to it. That way, even if you end up going through some rough patches of debugging, running out of ideas, etc., you'll have a greater chance at pushing through with the project and continuing to learn more from it since there would be an alternative form of motivation rather than solely based off of your desire to improve your development skills.

I'm not sure how much knowledge you have in terms of Studio/general coding languages, however, creating an obby could simultaneously help with design in addition to incorporating basic scripting elements into different stages. Here's some resources you could use:

#1. Written Resources

 * Lua Handbook (ROBLOX uses version 5.1.4, so it would be [this reference manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/) that would most be in date with this. However, keep in mind that ROBLOX has modified it so it's more simplistic, so this may not be entirely useful.)
 * [ROBLOX Developer Wiki](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/learn-roblox/all-tutorials) - The API is listed here as well as many smaller tutorials that can help at different levels of skill. (There also may be tutorials for building here, just in case you needed some help on that spectrum, however, I can’t entirely recall whether I’ve seen those or not.)
 * [ROBLOX Developer Forum](https://devforum.roblox.com/) Tons of fantastic resources here, as the majority of even partially dedicated developers tend to go here for scripting, building, and general development help or discussion. The open source projects that members of the community provide could also be a good way to learn how things work, but most tend to be very advanced. This is a reallllyyyy good place to ask questions/get feedback on your work!

#2. Video Resources

 * YOUTUBE! (Many fantastic tutorials can be found here that span a huge range of skill levels. [TheDevKing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2smVWjNGuRzD6HVWmlWwQ) is a pretty good place to go, as he has in-depth series for [beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhieaQmOk7nIfMZ1UmvKGPrwuwQVwAvFa) as well as for those who are more [advanced](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhieaQmOk7nIoGnFoACf33M3o0BOqB38a). Not sure if any of this is outdated, but [PeasPod/PeasFactory](https://www.youtube.com/user/PeasFactory/playlists) is classic one that was one of the earliest adopters when it came to good Studio tutorials. **I would suggest** at least **trying** to follow along with a YouTuber **to see if their teaching style matches** with **how YOU learn**. A big point to note would be that when you are learning something from a video, try and **cross reference** it with other YouTubers **to see the differences in how they explain it.** Take note that not everyone may go into as much depth with certain aspects of development when explaining/demonstrating what the video entails, so combining the knowledge from multiple sources may allow for a better understanding of certain concepts. This could allow you to get a more detailed/broader view as to different lenses that you could take when learning certain aspects of ROBLOX Studio. Other channels that are worth giving a go are: [Y3llow Mustang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEaBFdb9xUQjIB05HRG0cTw), [Okeanskiy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCch5yE-sVvh4OPB0kOxsGVg), and [Eppobot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAxoIRFhLUUcm3r3dGxHAew).

#3. Other Resources and Methods

 * [Scripting Helpers Website](https://scriptinghelpers.org/) (This one is like an open forum where you can post questions in regards to scripting. One of the good things about this is that there tends to be a lot of basic questions that have been answered here in the past, which may be able to help with any common problems that you may face while learning how to code.)
 * [Lua Learning](https://www.roblox.com/games/1334669864/Lua-Learning) (This is such an amazing game made by BoatBomber that is in the process of implementing lessons and quizzes that'll aide with scripting. Currently, its main use is the open source tutorials that users are able to publish to the game, which makes it almost like the ROBLOX Developer Wiki but from players instead.)

Hopefully these resources will be useful for you! Best of luck if you end up taking on the journey of development. It's a long process but can be worth it if you have enough patience and invest enough time into it.",1590969608

"MagicMushrooms","t5_2ql5m","I get depressed coming to this sub from all the pretty colors a lot of people grow. More depressed when some of you claim it's ok to eat from a tammed tub. SMH.

I built this to replace SABs, gloveboxes and any other sterile work space short of a true laminar flow hood. It uses a room size true HEPA filter available at Walmart Amazon and major drugstores. Think I got this one from Walmart online. It features a true HEPA filter to clean virtually all contaminants from the air. I payed $30 for the filter about 3-4 years ago. 

All it is is a clear drawstring trash bag with 3 holes cut in it. 1 hole is sized for the face of the filter and ductaped in place.  2 slits are cut for arm holes then clear packing tape used to reinforce arm slits to prevent tearing from end of the cut. The drawstring opening allows easy loading and unloading. It is also adjusted for air pressure. You don't want it so inflated it takes away a flat bottom to work on.

To use, set it up, use 70% iso and spray the interior of the bag.  Spray your hands,forearms and the outside of everything you load into it. Lightly spray the inside again and plug it in.  Allow 15 mins or so for the filter to evap the iso and push the fumes out. Spray your hands and forearms again, stick them through the arm slits and go to work. I have done agar pours, transfers, innoculation, LC nocs, G2G, substrain isolation, or any other mycology work that requires a sterile work environment.

It has many benefits over SABs and gloveboxes and is just as cheap to build. In a SAB every time you remove your arm you create a vacuum which sucks dirty outside air in. With the PPAB(positive pressure air bag) clean filtered air continually blows out the openings in the bag preventing entrance of contaminants. I placed a bunch of dishes and a couple agar jars in the bag for the pic to show how much more room there is in the bag than any but a commercial glove box. Without your hands in gloves, your dexterity is improved and your hands don't sweat making long use comfortable.

If the rest of your sterile technique is crap, then this won't help much but if you biggest issue is keeping Tam out of agar and grain nocs, nothing beats this short of a flow hood that costs thousands of $$. On the other hand if your sterile technique is pretty good, this can reduce Tam rate drastically saving you all the time and money tammed jars/bags cost you. The filter will pay for its self quickly.  Nobody even the pros and scientists can grow completely Tam free, but using this, I have reduced Tam to less than 1% so out of 100 tubs I only lose less than 1 tub.

It has one drawback as far as I'm concerned. Flame sterilizing of scapels and loops are done outside the bag just in case there's left over alcohol fumes.

Feel free to ask any questions. Sterile work is easy and doesn't have to be expensive.",1590969608

Everyone agrees it is a terrible incident. Everyone agrees they should be punished. The problem is people react in different ways that have no correlation to the original event. Ex. looting, rioting, arson. We need to take action, but this isn't the kind of action we should take. How does a Target or an AutoZone kill a black man?

When children worked in coal mines and there wasn’t any regulations unions were useful and needed, now they serve only the laziest and drive down the very thing you unionized to protect. When a cop who murders someone in cold blood gets paid leave and still is eligible for pension the union is responsible because they negotiated for it. Unions allow collective groups to skate by and do the bare minimum for max pay to the detriment of everyone involved. You can thank unions for the useless bureaucracy of our government, incompetence is rewarded with cushy jobs because it’s impossible to fire a government employee. Teachers, firefighters, DMV workers, cops should be able to be fired, arrested, sent to jail just like anyone else for being bad at their jobs. In fact it should be far easier to remove a bad cop than a bad fast food employee because bad cops kill and hurt innocent people where a bad cashier at McDonalds mixes up an order. My mom is a teacher she tells me there are plenty of bad teachers doing the bare minimum for a pension because they know they can get away with it.

I wish more people understood this. I broke up with my ex who had cheated on me and as you can imagine I have a ton of baggage. I tried being with someone else way sooner than I should have and all I felt was guilt and anxiety and worry about the future. 

I even sometimes brought my ex into that new thing I was starting... god it was so toxic and I couldn’t stand myself. I ended it. 

I don’t want to bring sadness or pain to the relationship, I don’t want to create trust issues so early on... I am going to take appropriate healing time because I really do care about the other person and I don’t want to hurt them with my toxic negativity.",1590969609

The random gen missions keep things interesting for me as well and the visuals are quite beautiful at times. There are some great mods that really polish up some of the things pgi fell short on, including AI behavior. I would recommend at full price, and def recommend at discount price! Start getting your stompy robot fix already!

Some of the mods I’d recommend are the AI fix, improved laser visuals, improved HUD, possibly the realistic velocity mod (although that may have unintended consequences with gameplay), among others. I’d look at the nexus mods page for MW 5 and find the most downloaded.",1590969610

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","OK, I'll break the full narrative down for you.

The mining company went ahead with the operation because it was legal for them to do so, despite them knowing full well that it was a rather awful thing to do.

I pointed out that an actions legal status does not always line up with wider society's view on that action. This is because laws are not always as comprehensive as they should be, and there are cadres of people who's profession is to find (or create!) the loopholes in the law which allow morally questionable behavior to not be prohibited by law.

You implied that if conservatives - presumably members of the U.S. conservative party, although I could be mistaken there - knew this (namely, that legality and morality do not always line up) they would start ""advocating for slavery"" as you put it.

This is where I saw a disconnect and became confused, hence my statement. Slavery is not legal, and hasn't been for over 150 years, at least in the US; longer in other countries. Even the most hard core of modern conservatives would be hard pressed to morally justify that slavery is moral. Regardless, that position is a flip-side of mine. My statement is that something which is legal is not necessarily moral. The ""supposed"" conservative position you implied was that something which is **il**legal is not necessarily **im**moral.

Legality and morality do not always line up. Some illegal things are *not* immoral (i.e. homosexuality in many places), and some legal things *are* immoral (i.e. blowing up a 46,000 year old Australian Aboriginal site). But I find the latter case to often be the more dangerous, if only because that is the case most likely to be exploited by extremely powerful entities (such as corporations) to the detriment of many.",1590969610

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well... my political opinions have gone completely haywire in the past few years. I was about 16 when kap began protesting and it was also during trump's election. During that election cycle I began to invest myself in politics and found myself becoming a ""MAGA dude"". So naturally, I wasnt a fan of the protest.

Unrelated to what's been occurring the past few days, but I've done more research and kindve studies both sides and have decided that Republicans and Democrats are two sides of awful and the government sucks at everything. So, I completely changed my support for Kap and people should be allowed to kneel for the anthem. (That being said I do believe Kap is asking for too much money to come back.)

My thoughts on the past few days: I truly believe there two different sides of Protesters and Rioters. I think weve grouped them together. If you are rooting I dont necessarily blame you, but if you try to loot someplace and get shot by the owner of that store, that is your fault and justified.

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","You need a knife (or a knife made from two stones). It's a bit silly that you can't cut up a chicken with an axe (or machete in your case), but no you need a knife.

Stand over it with knife in hand and R2. You'll end up with two fillets and a pile of bones.

To cook you will need:

Short stick (if you don't have matches) - harvested from small shrubs (walk up to shrub empty handed and R2 until the tree falls.

Long stick (for cooking fillets) - harvested from small trees in same way as above

Bark (again if you don't have matches) - walk up to big tree with knife in hand and R2

Logs (best if you have an axe but quite often using your hands on the right trees will produce logs - some of the smaller firs are best for giving logs)

Bandages or paper

To make fire:

Open inventory and put short stick in hand. Navigate to bandages or paper and hit circle (combine). This will automatically exit you from the inventory. Tap R2 followed by hold R2. This will build the start of a fire. If you have matches just take them to your hand and old R2 while looking at fire.

If you don't have matches put small stick in your hand and combine with bark. Tap R2 then hold R2 (this will make a fire starter). Take the fire starter to your hand, look at fire and hold R2.

You should now have a burning fire.

Open inventory and move (hold X on item) the logs over to the 'fuel' section of your fire (if the fire isn't in your vicinity it won't show up in inventory)

Take long stick to hand then highlight uncooked fillet and hit triangle. This will put the fillet on the stick. Look at the fire and hold R2. Your character will sit down and hold chicken in fire. Wait until it turns dark brown, open inventory, then navigate to the cooked chicken below the stick in your hand and square to add it to inventory.

Repeat with the other fillet. Fires burn longer now and I reckon you could cook about six chicken fillets with one fire.",1590969611

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Well, the history continues to be the *reality* of ""the present day dynamics,"" rather than just the façade the forced-birth movement would like to present -- which is why it's important to know the facts rather than the impression they've purposefully left you with. 

It benefits anti-choicers when people believe that spewing violent hatred against women who terminate pregnancies is a long-standing, core tenet of evangelical -- and by extension -- ""true Christian"" beliefs.

But the point is that it's **not**. They ***cynically, intentionally, adopted it as a political strategy*** to unite the white Christian (then) majority of the population as a voting bloc -- *to maintain segregation*.

It was never about abortions making baby Jesus cry. It was never about saving ""babies"". Not then, and not now.",1590969613

In a lot of ways, they've grown up at least familiar with LGBTQ+ inclusivity and probably know at least some out trans kids at school, unless you live in a really conservative area. I can't speak to your specific kids, their experience, or your location but I know when I came out at work (trans-masculine, non-binary) I went from being the kinda-intimidating-hard teacher to cool-badass in the kids eyes. It actually earned me some ""street cred"" with the kids I teach. 

They might get emotional, they might go back and forth emotionally as they process for a bit, a little like subconsciously grieving the loss of one parent while gaining a new one as they adjust, then feel guilty for feeling conflicted.

No it can't. Your opinion that the speed limit should be 100km/hr will not ever and cannot ever become a fact.

""the speed limit should be 100km/hr"" will never be a fact.

""the speed limit as posted by the city council is 100km/hr"" is a matter of fact and it is either objectively true or false. I don't care about it's ability to change from being objectively true to objectively false. That was not in the scope of this debate.

So, tying this back to the OP:

""murder is immoral"" will never be a fact.

""murder is immoral according to the rules of *insert moral theory here*"" is a matter of fact and is either objectively true or false.

So the next time this topic comes up, pay attention to whether or not someone is asking is it is objectively true that murder is immoral, or if murder is immoral according to the rules of some moral theory. 99 times out of 100 they will be asking the first question, which can never be a fact.",1590969614
"TalkTherapy","t5_39dpu","Lobstertail, this was so helpful. Thank you.

&gt;I’m wondering what type of therapy you’re in?

She's integrative, but with me primarily psychodynamic thus far. Started out with IFS but I rejected it.

&gt;Does she usually comfort you when you bring this up? Comfort from a therapist you’re very attached to can be like a drug.

Yes, most of the time she gives me what I need. I've actually used the words that it ""feels like a drug"" before and said that to her, so you're on point. It feels addictive and I crave it.

&gt;Your therapist is pointing out patterns to make you aware - this is how she is trying to guide you. It sucks, but she cannot give you a step by step plan of how to work through this. Therapy would be so much easier if we had a map!

She basically said the same thing in our follow up. That she doesn't have answers and there is no exact process to follow to deal with this, that she isn't the type of therapist that will lay out a complete plan and timeline or give homework because that doesn't feel right in this situation, which I agree with... I told her I don't want those things. I just want her to acknowledge what I'm dealing with. And in that session, it didn't feel like she was doing that, even though she's done it dozens of times... it instantly makes me feel like she's rejected me and I've done something wrong. (Yes, I've told her this).

&gt;She always acknowledged that it was normal for me to feel how I felt, especially because of my past, but we did not spend a lot of time discussing it at length.

I'll add that my T has told me before that based on what she knows about my past relationships that what I'm feeling is normal, and it doesn't freak her out. She expects this from me. I think that she's comforted me so much about these feelings in the past that now, when it doesn't happen exactly the way I want it to, I get upset and hurt.

&gt;If you’ve been doing good work together besides this rupture, I would straight up ask her if she feels equipped to handle your attachment issues and how she expects to move forward.

We have been doing good work. Every once in a while I get frustrated with this specific topic, but for every other issue in my life she's been exactly what I need.

Ummm, ok. Not looking for you to elaborate on this, just wanted this part pointed out.

&gt;Also, to try to paint all Police as  inhuman monsters that just want to oppress people is just as evil and  stupid as claiming all blacks are thugs.

Maybe the Police, who are in the position of power and have become militarized, shouldnt continue to target, harass, and assault minorities for generations. Being a cop doesnt automatically make you a good person.

&gt;And,  by the way, President Trump didn't have a thing to do with the  incident. Check out who controls the city government in Minneapolis if  you want to see who is responsible for what happened there.

Yeah, why should i blame the guy painting the protestors as thugs, and then sends the national guard, while spending his term thus far fueling racist biases and conspiracies. Trump is the higher authority, he get s the blame. If he doesnt want responsibility, leave the office.",1590969614

"Battlefield","t5_2rdgw","Thank you for this very informative Kotaku story but after reading through it all, my main takeaway from Anthem's failings is that Frostbite was not the only factor working against Bioware. The most relevant passage in the article was:

&gt; It’s a story of technical failings, as EA’s Frostbite engine continued to make life miserable for many of BioWare’s developers, and understaffed departments struggled to serve their team’s needs. It’s a story of two studios, one in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and another in Austin, Texas, that grew resentful toward one another thanks to a tense, lopsided relationship. It’s a story of a video game that was in development for nearly seven years but didn’t enter production until the final 18 months, thanks to big narrative reboots, major design overhauls, and a leadership team said to be unable to provide a consistent vision and unwilling to listen to feedback.

&gt; Perhaps most alarming, it’s a story about a studio in crisis. Dozens of developers, many of them decade-long veterans, have left BioWare over the past two years.

It sounds like the game wasn't going to succeed regardless of the game engine in use.",1590969614

"reactivedogs","t5_3jbj2","My dog Luke used to be super reactive when we first got him (I think someone raised him to be a guard dog, and we think he’s part border collie so he’s got a tendency to protect) &amp; what I usually do when he sees something, after he gives me his little warning bark, is grab his collar (firm but not in a way that would hurt, no yanking, it just lets him know I’m here and I’ve seen the thing he thinks is a threat) and pet his head a little bit (which seems like I’m rewarding him for barking but really I’m reassuring him that, no, that’s not a threat, we’re safe, thanks for the polite heads up though.) After a few seconds he settles back down, even if the thing he’s upset about is still there.

He used to be incredibly protective of me, and bark like crazy when he saw something and we were outside alone, but he was never really like that with my fiancé, I think because he has that deep testosterone voice and I sound like a 12 year old lol, but I found that showing him I’m “in charge” in other ways made him learn I will protect HIM and HE doesn’t need to protect ME. Mainly that just meant making him sit, paw, down, and roll over before I fed him his wet food (I read somewhere that “alphas eat first” so if you make your dog wait until you tell him to eat he’ll realize you’re in charge). It doesn’t hurt him at all, it takes all of 30 seconds, and it didn’t hurt our relationship, but we saw a huge difference in his guarding/reactive behavior in about a week.

Every once in a while if it’s a huge crowd, or a really big dude, or if it’s nighttime and the coyotes nearby start up, (or one time a plastic bag blowing down the street in the wind), he’ll bark for a little longer, but it really did make a huge difference without hurting our relationship at all. 

A lot of people will advocate for yanking them as a deterrent, so we tried that for about a week, (him and his adopted brother are our first dogs and we got a lot of unsolicited, bad advice) and it felt cruel and didn’t help at all. The ONLY time he gets yanked is the once in a while he lunges at a car, which has only happened two or three times with cars that look like my mom’s or my sisters, and even then I’m not yanking to hurt, just, ya know, to keep him out from under a car. His leash isn’t long enough to reach the road, but he’s 70lbs, so it takes a bit of force to hold him when he’s really pulling. It’s not even really a yank, just me holding him tight and not letting him pull me. We’re working on heel (in the safety of the yard) to put a stop to that.

Tl,dr; I think what you’re doing (have him look at you and give him a treat) will work better, it’ll just take longer. I’d suggest holding the treat til the trigger is gone though, so he maintains eye contact (if not with you, then with the treat at least) so he can’t go back to freaking out. And try showing him you’re in charge in other, small, non-harmful ways outside of stressful situations.",1590969614

"AMDHelp","t5_39gfx","Thank you for finding that thread. It was really useful to find out that someone else had pretty much exactly the same problem and could not solve it apart from replacing the cooler with a different one.  

Based on this, I decided to try something different. I had noticed that there were two fan headers on this motherboard: a CPU_FAN header, which is the primary one, and a CPU_OPT header which presumably is for an optional second cooler fan.  I simply moved the fan connector from the CPU_FAN header to the CPU_OPT header and immediately noticed a difference when going into the bios - the fan was running faster and was much more responsive to temperature changes in the way I would expect it to respond. The temperature also stopped increasing all the time.  Not having the connector attached to the CPU_FAN header did give an error message when starting the computer. I fixed this by making a change to the bios setting so it would ignore the FAN header and monitor the OPT header instead (in advanced -&gt; Monitor, change the CPU Fan Speed to “Ignore” and the CPU Optional Fan Speed to “Monitor”). 

After making those changes, the CPU runs at 35C-40C when idle and I have not yet seen it run much above 70C under load. I can hear the fan speed up as the temperature goes up, but it never sounds very loud to me.  

It therefore looks like changing the fan connect from CPU_FAN to CPU_OPT did fix the problem.",1590969617

Take the french revolution for example, while it was more organised than this shite it was still very riot based. What followed the French revolution was the reign of terror, one of the most brutal times in history. What followed the reign of terror came Napoleon who finally brought temporary order to France, while at the same time being badically just another monarch. If you want change, everyone must be organised and unified with a set end goal in mind.

"AnimalCrossing","t5_2ro2c","I posted this twice already, but give it a read. Its only a small part, if you want to read the whole response Google ""eli5 all lives matter"". After reading it a light bulb clicked for me. Hope it helps. 



Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any. So you say ""I should get my fair share."" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, ""*everyone* should get their fair share."" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share *also*. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!

The problem is that the statement ""I should get my fair share"" had an implicit ""too"" at the end: ""I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else."" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant ""*only* I should get my fair share"", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that ""everyone should get their fair share,"" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.

That's the situation of the ""black lives matter"" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society.

Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase ""black lives matter"" also has an implicit ""too"" at the end: it's saying that black lives should *also* matter. But responding to this by saying ""*all* lives matter"" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means ""*only* black lives matter,"" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying ""all lives matter"" *as a direct response* to ""black lives matter"" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.",1590969617

You should work to understand how things are from his perspective - why certain things seem illogical, and he should work to understand your perspective and preferences. 

I also think you should have a deep conversation with him about your OCD and what it affects. I don't think he was trying to be rude when he asked you in that instance, though it may have come off the wrong way.

"FinancialCareers","t5_2scvl","Ok I will take back what I said on liquidity because it is dependant on the particular issuer, fragmented is a better way to put it. For example, the recent MTA deal was heavily oversubscribed, but a small local government that only issues in small amounts or infrequently is going to be less desired by the financial institutions. Like you said, these smaller deals are going to be more for retail or SMA portfolios that will buy what they can find in their state to get double tax exemption. I have been in muni research for less than a year now so I am still learning, but from what I have gathered our funds and competitors have had trouble unwinding positions in the high yield space due to the poor performance of HY post COVID. There was a flight to quality in muni's, as well as large outflows from funds, both combined lead to a lot of funds trying to unwind HY exposure which has lead to liquidity issues in HY. It's not necessarily that you can't sell it, its that you may have to sell in pieces over time. Of course, this is a generalization, people will want to sell their worst names first. Also, a lot of funds were leveraged, and the rates for the leverage spiked significantly, leading to forced deleveraging and therefore selling.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Honestly, it's your own fault. You gave them that kind of attention, you took this role. And that didn't happen overnight, it takes years to establish this type of friendship. The reason I'm telling you this is so you would understand that there is no fast way to change it. It will take months of slow progression in order to create these boundries and not hurt people in the process. 

The thing about your friends, teach them a simple rule, phonecall means it's important ""I need you right now"", while text means asap, which if you are with your gf, studying or say watching pirated bluray of Raimi Spider-Man for 8 time this year, you will respond once you are done. You do that by calling them every time they assault you with texts. If they send one long text, something like your post, you reply once you can. If they bombard you with multiple short texts, you give them a phonecall, ask them what happened, pretend to be worried, it will make them feel silly and with time, they will start to communicate by hitting space instead of send after each sentence. And in return respond as soon as you have time, already knowing whole issue.


The gf part is well, shitty. Not your fault, she is just that kind of person, wouldn't advise using her technique against her, this kind of people don't understand that. Maybe try changing that by hanging out a bit more often, or facetime'ing instead of talking to each other all through the day on texts. You can use lines like ""sorry, I'll tell you all about it then we meet, don't want to take more of your time with texts."" But it might not work. Sometimes does.

As for your mother, you will need to do it slowly as well. You trained her to receive 20 texts or calls about your location. You need to untrain her. Count the last 3 weeks average number of these calls and texts per day. Now start limiting your daily texts to that number. Once you manage to go a week without getting over that number, decrease it by 1. Once you manage about two weeks without a day above the line, decrease it again. Don't rush this, she is worried, she can't stop herself. As I said, there is no fast change here. But don't tell her about this limit. It will only make her sad. I don't know at what average you are going to start, but in half a year you should be able to stop reporting completely.",1590969618

&gt;Exactly, these cases like with Floyd not the numbers.

Look at your reply.

&gt;Yes it's about police abuse towards black people. Where do I say it doesn't matter or doesn't exist?

You can find the answer to your question in your own reply, as I have said.

&gt;Who is shooting at the police? So you think burning down buildings warrant the police shooting journalists and people not involved with the rioting?

Let's say I burned your house down and starting throwing rocks at you. Will you be ok about it because it was for George Floyd? Should they be expected to be not scared abd provoked because they are police? Are police not considered humans? Both of the actions of police and civilians are not right. You are just justifying other the civilians. 

&gt;You do realize that the incidents aren't happening during riots? Are the people sitting on their porch rioting? That takes planning and preparation and isn't something that just happens because of emotions.

Yes, what is your point? You just came from mobs of angry people throw things at you, spitting at you, and videotaping you. You are tired beyond belief. You see these same people outside. You expect everyone to stay calm?  I'm starting to see why riot are being justified.",1590969618

There are lists of disappeared people - for example a pair of disappeared teenage girls in October still haven't been found to the best of my knowledge - and there have been unnatural increases in cases of e.g. [unidentified/unidentifiable dead bodies](https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E5%BF%98%E8%A8%98%E5%A2%93%E7%A2%91%E4%B8%8A%E7%9A%84%E7%B7%A8%E8%99%9F/). I wouldn't want to provide any links to you for the actual lists of people, as I do not know what unscrupulous ends you could be doing with a list like that.

You're a walking, talking example of the sunk cost fallacy. Spending years working for a relationship with a guy that isn't right for you won't magically make it a better relationship, it only makes you resentful and keeps you invested for the wrong reasons.    

The truth is that you'll probably be better off in a future where you cut your losses with this guy, and find someone who is actually compatible with you. Just because you wasted your teenage years on this guy doesn't mean it's worth wasting your twenties (and thirties) on him as well. Your chances of finding lasting happiness seem to be vastly better if you start get out of this doomed relationship.

I mostly used sky for solar panels and defending them with anti-air...until I got Combots with jetpacks. Then it was just crazy long range howitzer/missile/sniper attacks while staying continuously in the air so enemy non-flying combots would only be able to watch or do measely ranged attack.

As long as your mates hold its worth cuz you are getting something...


Lategame trynd can 1v2 easily in most scenarios... So your team should be in the favor at any state. 
If the enemies are having a heavy engage team fight comp then you have to be careful to use good flanks. Its also one of trynds big strengths that are used less. 4sec cd on e lets you roam around map fast.

"antidepressants","t5_2szuo","Everyone is different. I am not a doctor and can only share what I have done and read. I am currently on 31.25 mg of Pristiq.  I was on 150 mg and have tapered over a long period reducing 10% every four weeks. I found this method on Surviving Anti Depressants website.  There is a great support system and information on that website. Since there is no smaller dose then 25 mg where I live I plan to bridge with Prozac which has a much longer half life. Once switched over to Prozac (couple of weeks I believe) I will cold turkey Pristiq. I have been on ADs for almost 20 years.  Then I will start reducing Prozac.  

I have to imagine that what you are going through is the  normalization of the chemicals in your brain now that the AD is gone.  I don’t know how this cannot mess with our emotions.  If you too distressing, which would be understandable, then talk to your PDoc about going back on Pristiq and then bridge with Prozac.",1590969624

"Otomegame","t5_37071","Like what the other replies mentioned, how a person is raised, their experiences and the ideals that they pick up as they grow all affect the character and personality of an individual. Catarina was 8 years old when she bumped her head, so she as a person still has lots of room to grow and create an identity for herself as an individual. Since she was being raised to be arrogant and selfish, it's those building blocks that leads to the personality of the Villainess of Fortune Lover. 

A human is basically like a sketchbook; the individual is based on things you draw or write in a sketchbook and their personality will reflect it's content. You can think of it as a small Catarina writing down tainted and corrupted perceptions of the world based on how she's treated and taught, but after the head bump she doesn't have only future endeavors to reference on what to write or draw for that sketchbook, because to some extent there's already a character to reference from (she can look to an older, past sketchbook on what we can write on her current one), if that analogy makes sense.

Her past memories are additional building blocks that she can use to build up her personality, instead of waiting for all of them to fall onto her lap naturally like it should be for a growing kid. Instead of her body waiting to slowly adapt and create a set of morals, her past memories gives her a set of already established morals that she can use to view the world as it is now. 

So rather than say that Bakarina replaced Catarina, you have to remember that they are infact the same person. The only difference that the Game!Catarina and Bakarina has is the circumstances to which their character grew and developed as they age. Catarina grew up spoiled and arrogant thanks to her parents, while Bakarina would have definitely been set straight towards the same path if she didn't have the morals of her past life to use as reference for her personality.",1590969624

"westworld","t5_2xhxq","To put it this way, I don't care at all about MiB/William after end of S3. I don't know what narrative rabit they can pull out of a hat in S4 to change that. 

Why? Could explain properly and at length. To keep it short, I thought William was a very complex character, always battling the inner turmoil of embracing who he believes to be his true self inside the park and keeping that monster at bay outside of it. It turns out he was destined to be a gunslinger all along... no nature vs. nurture. Ford's manipulations in S2 didn't matter. In S3 they turned him into a demented, pitiable and incapable cartoon-style villain. It's still unclear to me if he recognises the hosts are actually conscious or that what he had with Dolores which locked him into his new loop wasn't a fiction and was always as real as he felt in the beginning. I didn't want nor expect redemption, it's impossible. But in keeping with the theme of S3, I expected him to be enlightened of his full circumstances + history and with great difficulty, demonstrate a will to change and to reject his former self before he was killed off by Charlores. I thought this would have made a great mirror image to to Dolores choosing the beauty in the finale and brought a fitting end to both arcs.

Anyway, in S4... what are the pathways forward. MiB bot = bad is boring. Or MiB bot is bad but is a host, can eventually change its programming and become good (reverse Teddy from S2), also boring. Why is a capacity to change not achievable for human MiB but achievable for a copied version of MiB-bot? Or, it's something else. Whatever it is I'm unlikely to be engaged by it.",1590969624

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","It’s sort of hard to put into words, but here’s how it typically goes for me after I start:

Random thoughts -&gt; “I need to quiet my mind” -&gt; *Thoughts quiet* -&gt; “I did it! My session’s going great.”

Now this is where a lot of people stop however you can keep going.

“I did it! My session’s going great!” -&gt; “Oh shit, now I’m thinking about the session. I gotta quiet my mind again” -&gt; *Thoughts quiet* -&gt; “I quieted my thoughts about the thoughts! Good work” -&gt; “Shit, now I’m thinking about the thoughts I had about the thoughts. I gotta quiet my mind again. -&gt; *Prolonged silence and peace*

It’s sort of like a loop where you constantly become aware of the fact you’re aware of the fact that you’re aware of the fact that you’re aware of the fact that your thoughts are quiet. You go through the loop long enough and eventually you intuitively find a way to become aware without actively thinking about it. For me, it will turn into a prolonged period of silence and peace where I “feel” the awareness but my mind is empty. Eventually the thoughts return and you restart the process. As you practice more, the silence becomes longer and easier to achieve.

Until CIG get 'Full Persistence' working (also referred to as 'iCache'), the majority of the data about your game session is only held on the server you're connected to.

If your client crashes, when you restart and log back in the game will try to connect you to the server you were on previously - in which case, your ship and cargo will still be available (unless destroyed whilst you were gone, etc).

However, if the server crashes, then nearly everything (inc. ship position and cargo etc) will be lost, because it was only held in memory on that server.

The pros who played (you usually could tell by skill level) would often come and 'clear' the machine to play other pros. They would also often offer tips and lessons once they got a feel for you as a regular.

Are you donating time or money to organizations who are working to dismantle racism? Are you promoting POC voices? Are you calling out racist behavior amongst your family, friends, coworkers, people in public? This isn't a complete list by any means, but I hope you get where I'm going. Marching is unpredictable - it can be peaceful or it can turn into chaos. Showing up is only part of the equation. Don't be so hard on yourself if you're taking other steps.

Tldr is basically veronica can do silly damage and marth can enable her to do it again immediately..

Veronica has a Last ability that boosts skill damage, and also has 100% skill prep. She has attacks that do silly damage against poisoned enemies and when she is low health. She has ranzals shared skill that inflicts poison and deals good damage, and the 4 light lance shared skill from this current Lief gala banner, which is a strong defense down zone. Veronicas last ability is once per battle but also stacks with other Veronicas.

Marth has a last ability that gives 100% skill prep to the whole team. He runs chocolatiers at the least which gives him 100% skill prep at battle start, then lets himself get hit with the peck to activate last boost which gives the whole team 100% charge bar again.

All of this combined with the strongest weapons right now equals dead chicken.",1590969630

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;/r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

The only thing preventing me from going there and living there is that I am slightly socially anxious, and I have problems with socializing and communication. Also, I'm Latino (Castizo) and I don't pass as white.

In any case, I consider myself a man's man. I've gone to Texas and have had the time of my life there. (Texas isn't the South, but it's the Bible Belt?)

I've gone to Georgia, and let me tell you, it's SO true that people there will vote for Trump, and vote against your rights, but they will chat you up like you were any other person.

Coming from someone who's only lived in the city his whole life, I've only experienced alienation, negative aspects of the urban life, etc. People don't genuinely care about you.

There's a dude at my work from North Carolina, and he's so homely I can tell he really cares about people. (Again, IDK if NC is in the ""South"", but it's far from San Diego, California, where I live.)

I'm trying to think of other positives from the South, because it's a topic of high interest for me.

I would probably fit in as one of the religious ""zealots"" there. I love the Bible, Church, God, Jesus, and I can perfectly reconcile it with my gayness, which I believe makes me a very unique individual. I grew up hugely Protestant Pentecostal Christian, and hugely traditional masculine, so I've been able to defend myself against people that try and attack me personally, and my faith.

Hearing that there are niches there in the South gives me hope that one day I might be able to at least visit the more ""deep"" areas.

Same shit, different day, as they say.

#A brief history of fascism

The antifa movement takes its name from the German group *Antifaschistische Aktion*, which was formed in the 1930s as a way of protesting the Nazi party and their fascist ideology. But what actually *is* fascism?

At a base level -- and you can consider this the ELI5 explanation; I'm convinced that someone will pop up to correct me on the finer points of the Northern Conservative Fascist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912, but I'm more interested in providing a primer than a PhD thesis -- fascism is a right-wing political philosophy that began in the early 20th century. [Pinning it down exactly is very difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism) -- political science definitions tend to be fiddly at the best of times -- but it (generally) includes:

* Authoritarianism; a tendency towards the ideal of a strong centralised power structure, with limitations on political freedoms outside of that.

* Extreme nationalism; a focus on one's own country (as opposed to a policy of globalism).

* Strong militarism; promotion of the army as a means of control, both at home and abroad.

* Strong opposition to disagreement or dissent; fascist governments often attempt to quell protests against them.

* Use of propaganda; state-sponsored (or at least, state-friendly) media are used to sway the public perception, often by appealing to nationalist, classist and populist rhetoric.

As a quick sidenote, before someone else inevitably posts it: there's a list of [fourteen traits of a fascist government](https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html) that has been going around the internet for a while, written by a man named Lawrence Britt. Britt is often cited as *Dr.* Lawrence Britt (he's not a doctor) and a historian (although that's not his profession; he's actually a novelist and businessman), but the content of his fourteen traits has debatable levels of accuracy. Some people agree that they line up pretty neatly with modern scholarship; others say that there are some flaws. /r/AskHistorians has a [better rundown of the topic than I can give here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r5dai/are_the_14_characteristics_of_fascism_outlined_by/), and is worth a read.

Additionally, it's important to remember that not a lot of organisations openly describe themselves as 'fascist' anymore; since the whole ghastly business with Mussolini and Hitler went down in the forties, it's become somewhat of a loaded term that is usually used as a pejorative. However, it's equally important to note that the fact that you claim your organisation isn't fascist -- or communist, or neo-Nazi, or whatever-the-fuck -- doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, because definitions aren't just things you get to apply to yourself. (See also: attempts by far right organisations to claim that the Nazis were in fact the *real* socialists, because it's [*right there in the name*](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/cfxg8u/whats_up_with_people_suddenly_claiming_hitler_and/eud6cdt/).) If there are questions about why the antifa movement targets people who don't obviously identify as 'fascist', they mostly come down to an issue of political branding.

#So where does antifa fit into all this?

The antifa movement in the United States took its lead from *Antifaschistische Aktion* in the twenties and thirties, based on the principle that use of violence in counter-protest is a justifiable response to violence perpetrated in the name of fascist, racist or homophobic agendas. This idea of ['direct action'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action) -- an individual using their own power to effect change, as opposed to the indirect action of appealing to politicians and others to bring about change for them -- extends not only to physical violence, but also to things like doxxing neo-Nazis and a policy of 'no-platforming' (that is, encouraging organisations not to invite members of far-right and alt-right groups to speak at conferences, denying them the opportunity to spread their rhetoric.) In short: the right would paint their activities as 'domestic terrorism' -- more on that later -- but antifa organisers would almost certainly see it as more in line with the civil disobedience of things like the suffragette movement. It's not, however, a strict left-right divide, despite efforts to paint it as such; many Democrats have spoken out against the antifa movement's methods, calling for peaceful protest as a solution to their problems instead.

(It's relatively common to see the group as a whole called Antifa -- capital A -- but this can be a bit misleading; there's no hierarchy to the organisation, merely different groups each of which may have their own internal structure. The actions of one group may have a lot in common with each other, but there's no superstructure.)",1590969632

I live near Seattle and in Seattle, the riots are breaking into several stores and stealing from them. These are small businesses, someone right now has just lost their entire source of income from that. They're breaking down the windows and burning people's cars. I get the police violence part, i completely get that. And i support the protest. But my question is, why are the rioters attacking uninvolved stores? I don't get that at all.

Look, I'm not gonna say it's gonna be easy, you've been there for 10 years being caught unknowingly. Getting out of these relationships requires a tremendous amount of will power on your part and willingness to move forward once and for all and not take any more shit. 

You can get all the closure you need by educating yourself about what happened in terms of the condition. She WILL reach out so you need to be strong to resist her attempts. Any progress you've made up to that point will mean nothing if you respond. They crave a reaction from US, do not give her that. You want to get back at her? The best way to get back at them is to move on with your life and they know that you just don;t give two flying fucks about them.

Hi /u/Awwa33!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

[Please message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmilf&amp;subject=Verification%20Request) with proof that:

`A.  You are actually the MILF in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the MILF's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or fully nude, but semi-nude is the minimum. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude/semi-nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","You may not like this perspective, and it could be totally inaccurate, but you might not be finding meaningful connections because you're not in a social group that values those things. Today, if you look for anything more serious than Tinder hook ups, you're pretty much a religious nut it seems. Well, I grew up in a very religious family, and I was indoctrinated by homeschooling, so maybe some things are still in my subconscious and driving what I look for in a relationship.  I'm an atheist now, though, and I wonder the same thing as you in terms of doubting if ""true"" connection is even a real thing or not.

 From reading a few of your other posts, I can tell you that most men who show you interest are not going to be treating you as you desire. As soon as they see/hear the ""feminist,"" whether its fair or not, the conservative ones will assume you're not interested in commitment and hate them for being masculine. Most of what would be left would be the guys looking for casual relationships - the ones who are okay with using you like you are nothing more than bones and meat don't care about your beliefs because they don't intend to put of with them... or you. It's pretty much a feedback loop for you too because you would have legitimate reasons to start getting bitter towards men. 

I'm making an assertion here, but I would not be surprised if your perspective on men is largely shaped in honesty. That is, you've had a lot of experience with the kind of men no one respects. So, it's not that your perspective is wrong, but I think it might be limited in scope. To be honest, I don't have a great solution. After a few bad experiences, I get nihilistic and start thinking that no women are interested in meaningful relationships anymore and that they all want casual sex (which, for whatever reason, I still hate the thought of). But your post makes me think that maybe I attribute traits to people based on what I assume all self-proclaimed feminists are like. I would be considered a right wing libertarian, so there really could not be a greater divide, yet the fact that we agree on this is proof that we are both probably wrong about stuff, if we agree on this yet have come to such radically different conclusions. It might be that people we consider to be our sociopolitical opponents may be far more similar than we realize. Again, I don't have a perfect solution, but I think it comes down to social groups. We need to find ones that value what we value. Most of the mainstream atheist community I have trouble with because I've noticed a clear preference for casual hook ups. The religious community is off the table too because they would always try to convert us or something. I really think the answer lies in finding a community of people who share your values in terms of relationships, though I haven't found it yet. No progress will ever be made with people who aren't looking for commitment. All you'll get with them is the shallow talk.",1590969637

"htpc","t5_2rbfy","Doesn't matter, as long as it's not an ancient cable.

While there are different HDMI port versions (e.g. 1.4, 2.0) that support different max resolution/framerates, the cables are still the same. There was an old standard HDMI cable that only supported 1080i/720p, and then the ""newer"" high-speed cables. And I mean ""newer"" in relative terms, they've been around for a while (like 10 years). As long as what you have is a high-speed cable, which it sounds like it is, you're good. There isn't such a thing as a newfangled ultra-high-speed HDMI cable. There's been new revisions to HDMI, e.g. HDMI 2.0, but older high-speed cables still work fine with the revisions. The newer revisions just affect TVs/receivers/motherboards/GPUs/other playback devices and what they support and/or have ports rated for. The cables are all still the same.

Any HDMI cable you buy these days will be a high-speed cable. Don't get sucked into paying more, there aren't any special super high speed cables. They'll all work with the newer HDMI revisions.

The only thing you're paying for is the quality of the connectors, durability etc. The cable itself won't affect the video quality as long as it's making a good connection.

&amp;#x200B;

The limiting factor for 4K@60fps will be your GPU and TV. Your TV should have HDMI 2.0, and I think GTX 970s have HDMI 2.0 too. As long as both your TV and playback device support HDMI 2.0 (and your AVR if you had one in the mix), you should be good for 4K@60 fps. And any high-speed HDMI cable should be able to carry that.

If any of your devices are only HDMI 1.4, you'll be limited to 4K@ 24 or 30 fps. It's the devices that are the limiting factor, not the cable. But it sounds like both ends of your chain should be HDMI 2.0, so I think you're good on that front.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It plays the movies well, but it does make my PC pretty loud

I don't think a 970 has full support for hardware decoding of HEVC. They do hybrid decoding for HEVC, some of the work is still done by the CPU: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia\_PureVideo#Feature\_Set\_E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_PureVideo#Feature_Set_E)

This means for 4K HEVC playback your CPU has to do some of the work, which is less effecient, produces more heat, your fans spin faster and louder.

I think you need a 10xx card or better to have full support for hardware decoding of HEVC. Not really a huge deal as long as your CPU can handle the extra load though.",1590969637
"fistofthenorthstar","t5_2sopz","Ultimately I'm going to say Falco.

Ken was far faster than Souther in their first fight, so much so that Souther couldn't even see him at one point (something Souther admitted). He only survived that encounter due to his body.

But on the other hand Falco also admitted Ken superiority, saying that if he closed in from the start he could have easily killed him, Kenshiro replies that the reason he didn't was because something in Falco's eyes caused him to hold his fist back. Rihaku also says Ken was deliberately taking the brunt of Falco's blows in order to better understand him.

So both were dramatically outclassed by Kenshiro, I don't think using him as a measuring stick for their abilities is reliable.

That said, once Southers secret is no longer a part of the equation he'd inevitably fall back on his Tensho Juji Ho, and though that proves to be able to fly through physical attacks and defenses Falco frequently uses his Ki as a ranged attack which we see is the primary way of countering it.

Title: **I'm really unsure about what to do here.**

Original Post: 

&gt; I'll try to make this short: Back in late 2018, both my grandfather and my father(a month apart from each other) passed away leaving only me, one full biological brother and one half-brother, and my mother. Now, the issue is the house is not under me, my older brother, or my mother's. All three of us are legally able to have it under our names. But I just don't know where to go, we did try a lawyer, but he's not done shit if I were to be honest. We're at a standstill.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm well aware we need a legal paternity test, or whatever the hell it is for our half-brother(He's not related to both my dad and granddad.) This is in order to eliminate him as a heir.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But, the point is, I have no idea what to do. I don't have any clue. I've read into how to, but it's become a cluster-fuck in my head. And at this rate, considering what assets are involved, along the house we're to trying to get out of(I should of mentioned that), it would greatly help us pay off the taxes on this forsaken house(using a little of the assets) and  it would allow us to leave, as having it under one of our names would allow us to SELL the damn house.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So yea, I really need some advise or help, sorry for the obvious forms of rage, but I'm literally at my wits end here. Grief alongside this, makes blowing my head off seem pretty good right now...Please take that as a shitty joke.

And the B12 thing, B12 is a mineral that comes from the ground. Normally, we would get B12 from drinking unsantizied water. So, since we have to sanitize our water, we lose the B12. The only reason animal products have B12 is because it is common practice for the feed given to livestock to be fortified with B12. In fact, dairy and non dairy milks are often fortified with it as well. Studies have shown that vegans, vegetarians and omnivores are equally low in B12 and would all benefit from taking a supplement. 

Good luck on your vegan journey! Good for you for standing your ground!

"france","t5_2qhjz","Salut,

Tout d'abord j'espère que tu pourras trouver ici les conseils que tu cherches. Mais si tu parles anglais je pense que les subreddits r/depression et r/depression_help seront peut être plus efficaces puisqu'ils pourront normalement te mettre en relation avec des gens qui ont eu des expériences similaires et qui seront peut-être plus à même de t'aider. Ou pourquoi pas des groupes de paroles ? Je suis certain qu'en posant la question aux personnes qui te suivent tu pourrais avoir des infos la dessus. Sinon, après une rapide recherche internet, je suis tombé la dessus. Je le laisse en espérant que le lien ne soit pas striké quand je posterai sinon j'éditerai le com pour que tu puisses le voir :  [https://www.la-depression.org/numeros-dappels-utiles/](https://www.la-depression.org/numeros-dappels-utiles/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Ceci dit, en te lisant, j'ai déjà l'impression que tu en fais beaucoup pour essayer de te sortir de ta situation et je pense que c'est super dans le sens où tu ne te laisses pas abattre et tu veux aller de l'avant. J'ai connu quelques dépressifs et je dois dire que quand ils en arrivaient au stade où tu es, les choses n'ont pas tardé à s'améliorer.

Tu es déjà en contact avec des professionnels qui peuvent t'aider mais je pense que quelque part, le problème est que ta famille toxique va saper le travail que ton psy et ton assistante sociale vont faire.

&amp;#x200B;

Je te dis ça parce que j'ai vu que ça se passait comme ça avec ma femme (qui est bipolaire et pas dépressive mais ça se ressemble un peu et c'est l'expérience la plus poussée que j'ai pu avoir donc je me baserai la dessus).

Avant de continuer, je veux insister sur le fait que rien de ce que je vais écrire ensuite n'a pour but de te faire sentir mal ou de te rabaisser. 

En général, et encore plus dans ton cas c'est normal d'avoir peur. Peur que les choses ne se passent pas bien, que les traumas se reproduisent.... mais malhereusement il n'y a pas de solution magique et il faut avancer et quelques fois se forcer à faire des choses et se rendre compte qu'en fait tu peux parfaitement les faire et qu'en fait c'est plus simple que ce que tu pensais. Bien sûr quelques fois ça ne marchera pas mais ça tu ne peux pas le savoir avant d'essayer. Le problème quand tu es en dépression c'est que tu es ta pire ennemie puisque tu vas te ""saboter"" avant même d'essayer.

&amp;#x200B;

Ensuite, je pense que tu as complètement raison de vouloir t'éloigner de ta famille. Ca te permettra de ne plus subir leur influence négative d'une part et d'autre part vivre seule te permettra, à mon avis, avec de l'aide, de reprendre confiance en toi et ça sera la première pierre de ta nouvelle vie que tu poseras. Et quitte à déménager pourquoi ne pas choisir une grande ville avec des transports en commun qui te permettraient de ne pas être handicapée par l'absence de permis. Et comme la proximité de ta famille n'a vraiment pas l'air d'être une priorité, il n'y a pas une ville ou une région qui t'a toujours plu et que tu voudrais découvrir ?

Pour la location, TB54 a raison en disant qu'une location en HLM prend en général du temps et que ce n'est pas une solution d'urgence mais ça peut être une solution à moyen ou long terme. En attendant, tu peux chercher des locations normales puisqu'il y a des aides qui peuvent compenser l'absence de garant (regarde la garantie Visale par exemple). Au pire, je suis sur que ton AS sera beaucoup plus renseignée que moi sur le sujet.

Une autre solution serait sinon comme tu le dis de trouver une formation qui te plait, ce qui pourrait te permettre de bénéficier de bourses et pourquoi pas d'un logement étudiant qui ont en général des facilités de bail.

Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai envie de te conseiller de tenter le coup. Dans le pire des cas ça ne marche pas et tu n'as rien à perdre et si ça marche ça t'aidera beaucoup.

&amp;#x200B;

Quant à la solitude mon premier conseil (pas très original) est de garder contact avec tes amis même s'ils sont loin mais c'est eux qui te connaissent le mieux et qui pourront t'aider et avec qui tu pourras parler le plus à l'aise. C'est une solution en attendant que tu puisses te former un nouveau cercles d'amis que tu pourras fréquenter physiquement là ou tu vis (ou vivras) . Une autre solution temporaire pourrait être de te rapprocher d'un CMP dans ta région. Je sais qu'en général ils organisent assez souvent des sorties que ce soit à but thérapeutique ou simplement pour permettre aux gens de créer du lien social. Et puisqu'on est sur ce sujet là et que tu préfères parler avec un étranger sur internet qui ne te connait pas et ne te jugera pas, n'hésite pas. Je sais à quel point les choses peuvent être dures parfois.

Une autre chose qui a beaucoup aidé ma femme c'est de tenir un journal. Ca te permet de mettre tes pensées à plat, de les ordonner, de formuler tes sentiments et tes impressions qui resteraient en non-dit autrement. Ca te permet aussi, en te relisant de te rendre compte par quel processus de pensée tu vas avoir une idée que tu vas juger nulle juste après.

&amp;#x200B;

Pour finir, je vais m'excuser de ce pavé où, je l'espère, tu auras pu trouver un peu d'aide et d'idées pour continuer ; et te rejoindre sur le fait que ta vie est à toi et que toi seule peut décider quoi en faire. Ne te laisses pas abattre, tu es déjà arrivée très loin, trop loin, pour abandonner. 

Bon courage à toi !",1590969640

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","&gt; What I was more trying to figure out is if there was hope for her in any way, shape or form.

It entirely depends on how much self-awareness and how much genuine honesty she's able to muster about herself, where she is at this point in her life, and how much work she thinks she can put in on herself.

People lie about themselves and the severity of their issues all the damn time. It's a natural defense mechanism because it's fucking threatening to realize ""Well, shit I am almost solely responsible for my current situation in life and my tendency to hold knives against other people.""

There's hope if she can get past that without denial, blame-shifting, or whatever other tactics people use to avoid responsibility and accountability.

But that is absolutely not something you can figure out about her, or for her, or whatever.

&gt; The fact that I was thinking relationships like this were ""normal"" was my reason for leaving because of rather be single and slightly unhappy than in a relationship and unhappy most of the time.

You might benefit from talking to a counselor or a therapist, if only to go through any assumptions about what a healthy relationship looks like. Or try to find a support group for people who have experienced domestic violence, lots of them teach survivors what kind of person to avoid in the future, what constitutes a safe person to be around, etc.

Nobody really is taught these things, it's ""assumed"" people just know or figure it out at some point, but the information is out there. It's not easy to access though.",1590969642

"CurseofStrahd","t5_9pba2","I've run it twice – with some compromises, but without any mods. With the benefit of experience, I believe the key to running it RAW is to make sure your players know what they're in for before they create their characters: it's not Lord of the Rings, it's a horror movie. In horror movies, characters can die very suddenly – and when it happens, that gut-punch feeling – and the chill that everyone else experiences from knowing *it could have been me* – should be part of the fun! The less you compromise on the deadliness early on, the more likely the players are to take the later threats seriously and not try to 1v1 Lorghoth the Decayer.

Also, make sure the trigger for that Shadow encounter is blatant [shmuck-bait](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait) – make that statue with the crystal ball as ominous as you possibly can. Don't assume they touch it – make sure it's explicitly stated that they do so. If that thing isn't soaking in 'touch this and die' vibes, then the consequences for disturbing it will feel unfair. In this way, you can ensure that if they *do* trigger it, they know that at least in part, it's on them. My first party would have been in dire straits if they didn't have a Light Cleric with Radiance of the Dawn, but my second group eventually made the smart decision not to touch it.

The first couple floors of the house may seem like they have a lot of empty rooms, but it's all about building the tension and atmosphere. As a DM running this almost off-the-cuff first time round I was thinking *""Why is nothing happening?""* But the players weren't bored – they were turning over everything, expecting every bit of spooky set-dressing I described to come to life and jump out at them. Second time around I leaned into this, tied in some personal touches that related directly to the PCs – familiar faces and voices in the mist beyond the windows...

I didn't run it 100% RAW, more like 95%; I tailored it to my players and their expectations, and both times around everybody had fun with it.",1590969642

"KOTORmemes","t5_3jjbr","Revan is male and the Exile is female was the previous canon. At a certain point, it’s just disrespectful to the fanbase to change such a fundamentally rooted thing that a large majority of people accept as canon.

Just saying Revan was not canon started an uproar and clearly people enjoy the way the canon is when it revolves around Revan. There is a massive amount to like. 

Revan is also meant to contrast Alek/Malek. They walked the same path yet had completely different outcomes. So the closer Revan is to Alek, the better the story becomes. 

This is similar with the Exile and Kreia. They walk a very similar path but end up with different outcomes. So the closer the exile is to Kreia, the better.

On top of that, the closer Revan is to Alek, the more distinctive the differences are. An example would be Revan is shorter than Alek as Alek was a warmonger and Revan was more a diplomat. It also defies standard norms in saying that the larger more domineering person is the more powerful. A lot of the light v dark arguments surround this very concept that the light is more powerful because of the togetherness of it, which appears weaker as a link, but stronger as a whole.

It also makes the Bastilla romance flow easier and allows us to not immediately dismiss the existence of Jedi like Satale Shan. Personally, I would like to keep the potential of her existence in canon as she is an awesome Jedi who does cool shit. But further, the redemption arc of Revan and Bastilla doesn’t work if you don’t have the Bastilla romance. Unless you have a female Revan that is lesbian. But then the Satale Shan point still holds.

Also, while I understand the point of inclusion by making someone female, it fundamentally doesn’t work. The point of inclusion doesn’t work here as people will just bicker and argue in a negative tone about what gender Revan is. This will encourage people to actively reject a female Revan. One of the goals of inclusion is to prevent active rejection of any group simply based off a defining characteristic of that group that is not related to the goals of the choice. (Ie. If I reject a programmer simply because she is a female, thats not inclusive). 

On top of that, if Revan has a story where it is concluded that Revan is a she, why don’t you just add a strongly developed like able female character or have a main story where the main character is female and likeable. For example, Ahsoka Tano whom I would classify as the same likeability as Revan. That is a much better alternative that would upset less people and would get more people on the side of inclusion as well.

So, there is a lot of reasoning to keep Revan male. I hope this helped understand why people want to keep Revan male and why it may be better to keep Revan male.",1590969642

They used to spurt the usual business about sleepovers/parties being dangerous, but often left me in the care of their Asian friends in our country (which did involve sleeping over at their houses) when they had business trips/intense work periods.

It really frustrates me that they emigrated to a different country and yet refuse to adapt to living in the country in so many ways. (Not to mention they blame me for the move even though I barely even had a choice in the matter, being just 3/4 when we emigrated...)",1590969642

&gt; If you can't squat ass to grass though 

What does this mean?

&gt; it will probably hurt like hell. 

Why would it hurt to sleep on the flood if you can’t squat ass to grass?

&gt; It took me a couple of years to work up to that mobility (sitting in a chair all day will do that to you)

What does this mean? You need mobility to sleep on the floor? (These are serious questions lol I swear).

&gt; Like of course it's nice to bed down on something soft but I have way less acid reflux at night on top of a sleeping bag on the floor than in any bed.

Do you regularly sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor? That sounds awful. What about those mats Japanese people use (I forget what they’re called by I had a roommate from Tokyo once upon a time and he used one — and told me all about it, everyone sleeps on one if these mats in Japan)? 

Why does sleeping on the floor help acid reflux? Because you’re on your back?",1590969642

Also the styles of homes are different but that's kind of the gist :D In the midwest/other cities most photographers just shoots that way but here in LA some realtors prefer a natural/airy style.

I found this link which has a lot of info about the ingredients so if you wanted you could start searching for deodorants that used similar ingredients.

https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=6608602f-525e-44ec-8f90-f3e815da19fc&amp;type=display

The red satin deodorant also says “ultra clear” on the front so you could try looking for other degree deodorants that are labeled that way too. I hope you find something that works for you!",1590969644

"titanfolk","t5_ioe0d","I can see it going two ways.  Both outcomes of his character could be pretty cool if done right. 

In one ending, where the rumbling is successful, i can envision him living a simple life in whats left of the world- As a big brother figure for Gabi, Falco, and possibly even Historias child.  After the Rumbling, Eren would probably revoke the power of the titans from all Eldians, so Reiners curse of Ymir would no longer be in effect.

Hopefully, he would realize that he doesn't need to be who rushes into danger, risking your life to protect someone else. He could do something as mundane as be there for his family and friends. And that could be enough for them.

Or, in the event that Eren is killed by the alliance before the world is destroyed, Magath and Pieck turn on the SC and Paradis after they help defeat Eren, and Paradis is then destroyed.

Reiner would be hailed as a hero by the world for defeating the devil Eren, though he probably didn't to much in the actual fight. And after finally destroying those island devils and completing his mission, and being branded as the hero he always wanted to be, the guilt of his actions does not go magically go away, but is instead all he has left. 

He continues to suffer, until his curse of Ymir kills him. He dies knowing that the war with Paradis has only increased the fear of Eldians, and with the advances of warfare technology, it's only a matter of time before the world once again questions letting Eldians continue existing.

It's kind of ironic, but i think his good and bad ending are opposite of where the thinks them to be.",1590969644

I mean like dude, no. The police are  attacking innocents. The first riots were because of police provocation and all of these protests and riots didnt just come out of nowhere. If the state had properly responded when the most violent protest going on was NFL players taking a knee then it never would have escelated this far. Police showed up to the first peaceful protests fully equipped with riot gear. Honestly if you ask me the mistake the protestors made was showing up unarmed since if they were then maybe the police would have hesitated to shoot at them and escelate things themselves.

In the end we HAVE to hold those with power and authority to a HIGHER standard than the common public. These people have the legal authority to kill us without consequences, so any mistake they make is by default more impactful than any mistake you or I make.

Force them to release something even if its unfinished which then they could get heat for that too.
 
Cripple their funding to lay off some devs (which I wouldn't think anyone would want), but it would slow production.

There aren't many back you down into the blocks every possession big men in the league anymore. So working down near the rim isn't near as physically taxing as it used to be. Plus the Mavs are dealing with an early-mid 20s KP, he can work more on the defensive end (and has better tools for it) than a 33 year-old Dirk, and have enough in the tank for the offensive side of the ball (and Dirk didn't have a Luka type to handle a fair bit of the load).

That being said, when it comes to his knees, it may be preferred for him to have a Tyson type, instead of being that himself. But he does have the ability himself for that when it is needed.",1590969647

"halo","t5_2qixk","&gt; If you move around with a pistol when you can be using the knife, you are losing precious time. Time that can be used to reach a position quicker in a game where **milliseconds** can be the difference between life and death. 

Isn't that literally every competitive FPS game ever made?

&gt;You are dodging the question again, you admit that sprint (or a function similar to sprint) is required in both CS and RSS and yet, you argue it's not ""important"". How does that work?

Only according to you, which makes me think I'm arguing with an *actual* child that doesn't know how the argumentative process works. I'm arguing that CS's movement mechanic using the knife isn't like Halo 5's Sprint, nor is it like RSS's. Both of those *have* the mechanic, but it's functionally different to Halo 5's sprint, in that running around like a headless chicken (which Halo 5 seemingly encourages), would get you killed *very quickly* in both of those. Its utility is much more tactical, involved than Halo 5's. If CS:GO and RSS are chisels, Halo 5 is a sledgehammer.

&gt; ""use a pistol when you can use a knife"" 

Because the difference is literally 10 units for every gun *but* the Deagle, and in the Source engine, that doesn't mean much. 

&gt; I have already explained the 10% speed boost is more than enough for you to pick up a superior position, giving you the advantage 

If you're positioning, you're gonna want the speed boost to get into that position, but if you're going from Point A to Point B, I'd rather have some sort of gun up and ready to shoot than play an animation to ready my weapon when going from the knife. If you start shooting, the enemy will *probably* take cover, regardless of the weapon. *Probably.*

&gt; As for these pistol rounds, the ability to relocate and rotate is of vital important and it of paramount importance to switch to a knife to do so 

So the fact that it's literally a difference of 10 units for the majority of pistols in the game doesn't mean anything? If you're just blindly running around with a knife, you're going to get shot at by someone else who *isn't* running around with a knife. Probably the guy running (or walking so their footstep noise is reduced) with a Pistol during that Eco Round because it's *literally* a difference of 10 units.

&gt; Once again, I say that as someone with over 4k hours in the game. 

Sounds like you arguing this from a competitive perspective, which I never argue from because that represents a small, minute part of the community. Whenever I make an argument about a game, it's from a casual perspective because that's where *most* of the community lives. I wouldn't besmirch anyone for wanting to use a Pistol for movement because then you have a gun up and can, at the very least, scare another casual player into ""submission,"" where they retreat because they're being *shot* and you have the ability to raise your primary weapon.",1590969647

Every single 'Zen master' quoted on this place sought out a good teacher, and trained diligently.

Every single one.

Scale of one to ten of total fuck up, what would you give people like that that on the total fuck up scale?

The police had the previous 4 nights of carnage in their minds, and that's what they were expecting on the fifth night (last night). I can understand why they would want to ensure everyone goes inside. Why these people were on the porch to begin with- beyond me. I live in Minneapolis (do you?). I would not be out on my porch last night if you paid me. 

For safety's sake, I understand why a bit of force was necessary. (I'm not excusing the cops beating people just because they can, in any way. I'm arguing that these guys were trying to make a point to get people inside to prevent further injuries in a very incendiary time in Minneapolis.) Things are very scary here. There is no room for 'lookie lous' and people wanting to make a snapchat video. 

What would you do in their situation,  honestly? If you were tasked with enforcing order after 4 days of intense rioting and looting?

Make sure all windows and doors are locked at night and when you’re not there. Buy a taser or pepper spray and keep it in a place that you would be able to easily get to if needed. Finally, for your mental health, maybe stay with a family member or friend for a couple of days or ask someone to come stay at your house until you feel better.

If creating presentations, typing up documents, notetaking, and web-browsing comprises pretty much all of your workflow, you should be just fine with an iPad. But keep in mind there are many limitations to the software, especially for multitasking compared to a laptop. If you plan to do something that requires lots of specialized software, such as code, the iPad is not a good choice as a solo computer.

If there’s anything you need to do daily that there isn’t a really good app available for on the iPad, I’d recommend just getting a macbook. It’s really portable and has a long battery life as well, has a lot of similar benefits to an iPad, minus the tablet experience for amazing notetaking and other such things.",1590969650

Don't press to hard, only need a gentle amount of pressure for the soap to load. This will start loading up the brush. I apply a bit of water onto the brush and start building lather in a bowl, this time with more velocity and it should begin to build up. After about 2-3 minutes, you should have a nice lather.

&gt; Yemen and the majority of U.S. states do not require any permit for acquisition of a majority of types of firearms, meaning that any non-prohibited person can buy them from licensed dealers.

&gt; Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland [i Monako] are partially licensed meaning that any non-prohibited citizen can buy repeating rifles and break-action shotguns from licensed dealers and a permit is only required for handguns and semi-automatic firearms.

Usprkos relativno liberalnim zakonima, ljudi u ostalim državama koje si ti naveo u puno manjoj mjeri posjeduju oružje u usporedbi s SAD-om. Također je u većini potrebno proći određeni trening i temeljiti *background check* prije nego što dobiješ dozvolu. Određene vrste oružja (npr. većina poluautomatskog) su u potpunosti zabranjene. Dosta razumni zakoni.

S druge strane, američki zakoni o oružju su nebulozni. Potpuna je ludost omogućiti svakom da kupi AR-15 ili nešto slično i pobije pola škole/vrtića/crkve/kazališta. Slažem se s ovim ostalim američkim problemima koje si naveo, i da to jednim dijelom utječe na oružano nasilje. Ali čak i da nemaju sve te probleme, uvijek se nađe neki bolesnik kojem je život sranje i koji je sposoban počiniti masakr (*school shooters* su većinom tipovi koji su socijalno izolirani, to se ne bi promijenilo ni da se svi sistemski problemi riješe). Po mom mišljenju, ne bi mu to trebalo toliko lagano omogućiti.

EDIT: Forgot to mention the startup power required. This one works if you power it with a minimum of 2 batteries (I've only tested fully charged, so 8k power). Keep a pair of charged batteries unconnected in case power consumption spikes and the generator dies. Output is around 1.9k P/s

"law","t5_2qh9k","Contract Tracing is now a buzz word?  So much for public health...

Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harringon [stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnRvyLS4Lg) analysis of arrestees data is similar to Covid contact tracing.   Harringon's following statements include local and federal resources as well as social media platforms and flyers being used to investigate links to criminal or terrorist organizations.
  
**So, what's the difference?** Typically the term ""contract tracing"" is used in the realm of public health epidemiology.  ""Disease surveillance"" is another term used. The difference is police investigations use the term ""social media"". Here is an article from [ Richmond Journal of Law &amp; Technology](https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1380&amp;context=jolt).  

**Why words matter:**  In just two words, Commissioner Harringon changed ""contact tracing"" from epidemiology to government surveillance.  Know that Commissioner Harringon used ""contract tracing"" as a display of force.

**What to do?** Know the difference between ""contract tracing"" buzzwords and scare tactics.  Pay attention to the open-source apps Google and Apple are releasing.  Their apps are used to help with legitimate Covid tracing and are anonymous.  The code for the apps are open for anyone to view.

I'm just suggesting that if you pick up a real pencil and learn to draw, you won't have to spend hours and hours fastidiously tracing pics of the orange shitgibbon. Tracing is like training wheels - fine for a six-year-old, sad look for an adult.

See, you've gotten used to people in this forum giving you pats on the back, like your mom and your aunts telling you how nice and pretty your drawings are, but you encounter any real criticism and you don't quite know how to handle it.

Do you really think ""Fat-Hair"" is clever? Or meaningful to anyone that's not... you? Imagine you've hired a professional company to assemble and interview focus groups to sharpen your marketing.

Can you hear their responses?

*""Uh, I don't get 'Fat Hair'. It sounds gross.""*

*""It doesn't make me feel good. I don't like it. I don't want to look at it anymore, please.""*

*""What does it mean? Is it Trump's hair? Is his hair fat?""*

It's not just me, man. The whole thing is nauseating and it doesn't make any sense.

Besides, you missed my point entirely about quitting.

Yeah, I'm belligerent, because you freaking need it. You need it like an Open Mic Night comedian needs a heckler to push them to write better material and polish their act. You need it like a new recruit needs a drill sergeant telling them to stop doing baby pushups on their knees and cooing for compliments from strangers about how wonderful they are for doing such super-hard manly pushups. These are not manly pushups. Photo tracing and flaccid, overwrought writing are not heavy lifting.

Did you notice I gave you reading material suggestions on the art and craft of political cartooning? I want you to improve. To learn, not keep making this insufferable crap.

Learn to draw. Learn to think. Stop trying to be clever and learn what really being clever is; every Political Cartoon Saturday, have you noticed the sheer amount of talent in these professional cartoonists?

I’m actually not sure that I would consider that a Stellium since Mercury and the Sun are so far apart orb wise, being connected by the North Node (but both the Sun and Mercury being further out of orb than I would use for North Node conjunctions). Regardless, it still puts a heavy focus on the 3rd house area’s of life (like communication, learning, and thinking). I would probably think that you communicate (and think/learn) more intensely and passionately than Gemini energy does, since this house is ruled by Scorpio in your chart. Another thing that having all this energy in the this house will do is cause the the 1st house, the 4th house, the 10th house, the 12th house all to bend to the needs of this house. Just as an example, the way that you express yourself outwardly bends to your communication needs (and the way that you need to communicate).

This guy is obviously being paid **A LOT** of money but the rest of the police in the country aren't making nearly that much for the shitty shitty job they do. So just like some teachers (in the vast majority of counties nationwide) suffer low wages because they care about children...

...there will be a kind of cop who will suffer shitty pay so that they can carry a gun and hopefully kill someone.

The people in San Jose probably raised the compensation in hopes they would attract ""better"" applicants. :shrug:",1590969653

So I´d suggest you create a new epic games account on their homepage, from there you can link the switch to your epic by signing in with the respective nintendo account that is being used on the switch.  
Do that same process with the xbox account and the progress should be shared.

"singapore","t5_2qh8c","First of all, the construction landscape has been shaped by over thirty years of public-private-global interactions.

As I mentioned earlier in a thread about nursing, the big elephant in the room is that the government has the power to gate supply of labour into any sector in Singapore via the work permit/pass structure. I am sure that by now, the government has learnt that this tool is extremely potent/powerful with deep distortive effects in the long term.

Despite what many people think, construction is not un-skilled / low-skilled. In fact, it is often very hard work, requiring no small amount of physical exertion, hand-eye coordination. In Singapore, due to the history of the construction sector, parents encourage their children to study and get good grades to avoid the trades not only due to this, but due to the additional whammy of low pay as well.

That is all due to labour policy - something that is at the door step of the government. With wages suppressed due to adequate supply, beyond certain specialized construction firms or foreign ones that bring in the equipment and expertise, the ownership of our local construction firms have no incentive to have very highly skilled workers equipped with costly equipment.

If you look at the above at what I described, this is a similar story to most of the sectors in Singapore. There is a narrative that our government is far sighted, knows what to do, but do you guys know this isn't the first time we embarked on the productivity bent? We had one in the late 70's but nothing came of it.

If our leaders are truly interested in nuturing our SMEs into global firms that can compete against giants, then they woud have realise that there must be incentives for firm owners here to invest the pre-requisite capital into both human expertise and automation, to expand capacity, to expand into new markets that are not our domestic own, etc.

Unfortunately, it also does not help that the narrative of the Singapore government often pins the burden of productivity on local workers - that they have to pick up the slack and go for retraining, skilling up but it can be pointless if management is completely disinterested in making the capital investment into the other kind of investments that is often necessary for the increased output desired.

The big thing is that productivity increases comes often on the heels of intense capital investment into worker's training and equipment (there is a reason why accounting classed equipment purchases as assets) purchase.

You can be a mechanical engineer who has raised his/her skill to a very high level to be able to work with highly precise machinery or the creativity to create new processes/equipment to sell to other clients but your company owner is disinterested in making the capital outlays for such a piece of equipment because he rather seek returns in real estate/finance, etc.",1590969654

In return, China will develop their own domestic tech companies to replace them perhaps by poaching some of their engineers which these companies no longer have the business to keep.

Do not look at this as being bad or good. Simply understand that when there exists a monopoly, you want to be able to have a share of said monopoly hence why the conclusion of the US-China Trade War was to allow US hedge funds access to the Chinese market starting April 1st, 2020.

Forcinf the survivor across the map at a minimum means you have one less hook till they die on hook or are moried. In an average scenario this forces at least one individual to leave the immediate area to rescue. And at best instead of re tredding the field for more torment you make way to the caged survivor and line up a few hits with his ranged move.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;I feel like riots are the next reasonable step when peaceful protests fail. 

How do you know if peaceful protests ""failed""? Like, how do you know you've peacefully protested enough and that it truly hasn't meant anything, rather than maybe just needing to protest longer or with more people, or maybe the impact is delayed and in a few years  people will vote slightly differently or start introducing certain ballot initiatives as a result of the protest?

Or maybe your peaceful protests DID properly raise awareness, and the people now aware of your issue just disagree with you. Is that really something where escalating to violence is going to improve the situation?


I think you're biased because you agree with the current position being advocated for by these means. It's good to take a step back and look at a hypothetical scenario where you strongly disagree with the cause.

So as an example, what if a bunch of racists started peacefully protesting trying to get us to deport and/or execute any non-white person. Obviously we wouldn't make a policy shift like that overnight, so at what point should they say peaceful protests have failed?  And then once they escalate to violent protests, do you think you or anyone else are any more likely to start siding with them?",1590969655

Offer some cheap/free alternatives. Have a pot luck dinner and cheap grocery store wine instead of expensive club alcohol.

Police also profile black people and other minorities and stop them for suspicion of crime more frequently than white people, including people who are not “lower class”. Those stops lead to more frequent threats of violence that lead to confrontations and deaths. Those biases are based on 400+ years of inequity in this country. While I agree with the goal of addressing systemic poverty, that’s not going to magically make police biases go away. Police departments need to do the work to better train their officers and ensure better accountability for this kind of stuff.

"gmu","t5_2r1fn","Ok, now that you have finished ranting, I would suggest a cost benefit analysis for transferring. Some things to think about.

1) Graduation date seems to be important to you. Would transferring and taking their classes vs retaking the failed ones here be any different? You've suffered through a semester. At the very least, you now know somewhat how these classes operate and the familiarity might benefit you. Most schools require the last 2 years  (roughly 60 credits) from that school to graduate. I do not see how transferring would benefit you.

2) Where would you transfer to? What program(s) do they offer? Most schools these days require capstone projects.

3) Mason may have issues, but helping you land a job in your field is not one of them. Will the school your transferring to offer the same?

4) Ask yourself is this really what you want to do? If you really didn't care for it, which seems to be the case, do you really want to major in it. Your lack of motivation speaks volumes. Perhaps, this isn't the best choice.

Additional options:

1) Change your major. Doesn't mean you can't work in IT. I have many friends that graduated with liberal art degrees that ended up working in IT and do quite well either by on-the-job training, earning certs along the way, or just establishing themselves in a niche market. You don't have to graduate with an IT degree to be in the field. Would it be beneficial, most likely, but there are other ways to skin a bat.

2) Drop out. And just apply to AWS. They seem to be hiring everyone these days. There will be growth limitations, but you'll start working ASAP. Maybe when you're ready, you can re-start your degree part-time. It's okay to do it part-time and work at your own pace. Life isn't a race.

3) McDonald's is hiring. Oh, that sounds crappy? Well, there's your motivation. Mine was working retail for 6 months of mindless work.

I'm a firm believer of it is never too late. With that said, you need to sit down and be real with yourself. **Make a plan!** It's okay to whine, but if that's all you do, it will get you no where. Good luck to you. And farewell if that is what you choose.",1590969655

At the treaty signing, the absence of Cyre is a sore spot for the kingdoms of Breland, Karrnath, Aundair &amp; Thrane. Valenar views themselves as the heir to Cyre's power since it was formerly Cyran territory, and the Darguul &amp; Q'Barran/Lhazaar reps are apathetic at best. The nations themselves (aside from generic Deneith guards to pad the royal garrison &amp; Breland-loyal Medani scouts) are somewhat distrustful of the houses' higher ups.

If any of them were to brooch the topic of the Mourning in depth, either in private confidence or at the table, they'd all likely blame House Cannith's higher-ups, due to the lingering resentment of Warforged troops pervading every military (including Karrnath after the Emerald Claw schism). With the 3 remaining factions of House Cannith being at eachother's throats, any one of them could be a scapegoat for animosity between the countries (one lord telling the other to ""stop sheltering a possible terrorist"").

The neutral opinion would be to shrug, blame the now-dead Cyran-based Cannith, or suggest the emergent Lord of Blades could have something to do with it. If you follow the Bulwark-becoming L.O.B speculation, then a nutty NPC could reason a conspiracy for King Boranel colluding with the AWOL Bulwark which led to the Mourning. This would be treasonous or insane in Breland, but elsewhere could just be seen as nutjob anti-Brelish propaganda if the nation isn't too friendly.",1590969656

I'm open to being persuaded because like i say it's not my context. But I do have to say that in my country, and everywhere else in the developed world, we don't have such overarmed, trigger-happy cops. It seems like the main thing 2A does when it comes to how cops relate to people is that it gives cops an excuse to murder because they're 'scared' or because some guy reached into his pocket or was holding a fucking phablet.

"msp","t5_2slwq","This is the right answer.  What seems to be the cheapest from a technical level may not be in the sense of an entire business model.  Many MSPs have some level of Microsoft partnership, which allows them to get vendor support for issues and spread the cost across clients.  Additionally, some Azure/O365 support is included in the subscription (for what it's worth).   To get the same level of support from RHEL or Ubuntu is a per-server cost that effectively negates the OS savings in many cases. You can have good talent in the MSP to manage the servers, but that's not actually going to be a positive in the eyes of a client CFO.  To them, that's vendor lock-in that they're trying to avoid, since they would have to find another MSP with the same skill set if things go bad with the relationship - or if the current MSP loses its Linux experts.

Another factor is the fact most business applications at the SMB level where most MSPs play are still Windows-based.  Hell, it's hard to get those vendors to support the latest version of Windows Server, let alone one or more Linux distros.

It's likely that Linux will gain ground in SMB (thus MSPs) as things shift to IaaS - if comparable vendor support is rolled into the cloud offering and customers start pushing application vendors to provide software that works with it.  Web-based/PWA frontends certainly help with this, as does the slow migration from AD/GPO to things like AzureAD and web-based authentication/management.",1590969657

December till March isn’t that long of a relationship so I can understand how going into lockdown and being apart could cause someone’s feelings to change. If she has issues with commitment, then committing to a long distance relationship is probably something she’d have issues with. Is there a possibility there’s someone else? Probably not with everything going on. It also seemed like she was just generally losing interested during lockdown with not wanting to keep in contact as much. And even if there was, that just means she found someone else she felt more compatible with. Of the 6 billion people on earth, you can’t possibly be a great match with them all so don’t take that as a reflection of you.

America's diplomatic position has imploded. Your allies are adjusting to a world where they can't rely on you. At the same time, by continuing to withdraw from international agreements, you have been surrendering influence to others.

The corrosion of American institutions has been made clear. This has probably been going on for decades, not the extent of the damage was made clear in the last four years. The president acts with an alarming degree of impunity and is free to spread blatant lies, take revenge on whistleblowers and flaunt power for personal gain without repercussions. 

Worse still, when exposed to the stress of a pandemic, those institutions buckled. Your handling of the pandemic isn't ""bad"" or ""inadequate"", it is horrifying. A lot of Americans are going to die because your federal government can no longer respond to external threats. Many already have.

At the same time, dams are collapsing because nothing has been done about your infrastructure crisis. Your crime rates are still astronomical by modern standards (5.5 homicides per 100,000. In the UK it's 1.2. Australia is 1.0). You've slowed investment in green energy (AKA, the only kind of energy anyone will be using in 30 years). You have Nazi's openly marching at rallys.

It's honestly frightening to watch. I'm not someone who sees collapse as inevitable, but the recovery of institutions in particular is going to be very, very hard and take a long time. The country needs *massive* reform, and nobody with power seems to have much of an appetite for that.",1590969658

I played on hard but the only boss I found difficult was the 4th palace.  Other than that I only died to the first boss. 

Also the game holds your hand way to hard. ""Oh theres a switch, we should check it out"" was said so often.  Also adds to the fat I mentioned above.  

Sometimes the characters where way to forgiving. Especially to Akechi. 

I also felt too pressured on the social links and thus I felt I couldn't enjoy the other shit in the game like jazz bar, billiards etc. I maxed my technical in the 3rd semester when no confidants were available.

* On the flipside, there exists the grandiose stylistic enterprise that is Australian Private Reserve's *Winterfall*, one of the best leathers I have smelled in quite some time. It's an old-school chypre done in the classic French tradition and is my favorite of Dan's current offerings.

"Albuquerque","t5_2qxoe","no. THE VIOLENCE from those protests are why he was charged. they responded to the violence. not the protests. read some history. protests don't work (on a large scale) unless they represent a threat of force (which is violence) that can not so easily be ignored.

I don't want to advocate violence. but history proves it is the ONLY THING that works.

an established power NEVER gives up that power without violence. No exceptions.

in order for a protest to work it has to be violence. it has to represent a threat of force the established power can not ignore.

but you also must SELF POLICE and prevent agent provocateurs and opportunists and anarchists from usurping the protest for their own ""fun"" or ""agenda's""

the violence (threat of force) must be directed at the government. you must make demands and be willing to follow through with an application of force if your demands are not met (those demands also need to make sense mind you)

this requires a massive level of both participation (if the threat of force is large enough you won't have to apply force) but you MUST be ready and willing to follow through.

NO established power on this scale gives up that power without violence. none. there is no example to the contrary in all of human history. none.

your ignorance of this fact does not alter reality. it just makes you ignorant. nothing else.

I was using my imagination with my friends. We were working on a project in the hallway infront of the outside doors. We were pretending to be afraid because a monster was outside and out to get us. Then when my friends went to the bathroom together (cuz that's what kids do ig, (there were 3 of us, I stayed btw), I decided we would continue the game but this time we would pretend we saw a scary man.

We wanted our teacher to play with us too, so when she came to the hall to check on us, we told her about a ""man"" that had a gun, trying to tell us to come to him. She was shocked and told us to come inside the classroom immediately. Being 7, I don't remember why we didn't tell her it was fake at that moment, either we thought she was playing along or we thought it would blow over idk.

Later at home, my dad gets a call from the principal who is asking me to describe the man. It was too late to turn back now so I had to describe him. I was the only one they spoke to because my other friends had went to the bathroom, and they weren't reliable sources or something. After a call from the principal I thought it was over.

Nope. The rest of the week I would be pulled out if class to talk about the ""man"" to different people. My parents even came to the school and I had to reenact where the ""man"" was and what he did, what he was wearing, and what I did/my reaction. The principal gave me a bit of possible explanations like ""maybe he wasn't talking to you and didn't have a gun and you were just shocked there was a man"", I should have went with that but I stayed strong with my story.

My parents were upset that my school didn't have security cams to check the man and catch him, so they donated old security cams to the school until we could get proper ones. About a month later our school started getting us to sell chocolate so we could buy security cameras and door that need a pass to open.

We finally got them. Our school was the first school in the school board to get security cameras and doors that need a pass to open. The rest of the board had it mandatory for every school at the start of second grade.

The only people that know it was all a lie are random Redditors, my cousin's and my sister after I told them 7 years later. I can't tell my parents because they donated security cameras and I feel bad. So yeah thanks for coming to my ted talk. This probably doesn't make any sense cuz I just threw this together, I've told this story on here before btw. You probably didn't make it to the end anyway :)",1590969660

Problem being that i have pretty much done nothing physical my whole life. Closest thing ive done to this was cub scouts, which i wasn't in for long due to an anxiety disorder, three to six months if i recall correctly, didnt really get anything aside from a participation trophy for a wooden rocket. Due to this i seem to be struggling alot simply to stay upright from the hours im working, 5:45 with a 15 minute break on weekdays, although i suppose it's the US and they legally don't have to give me a break to begin with, as far as i can tell. Despite doing everything i feel i can, i always feel terrible about it at the ends of shifts cause it feels like I'm severely under-preforming. I'm not sure what to do, but i hope i figure out something. I've been considering trying to design mechanical braces with springs for it, although it feels like I'll mess even that up.

That's not really multiculturalism, that's just imperialism wearing a nicer suit.

Actual multiculturalism, as practiced in a number of western states, is a voluntary melding of different groups who want to live in a shared space. As a Canadian, multiculturalism works great because Canada has a clear national identity but one that allows for reinvention and updating, and we welcome those from around the world who would like to help us make our country even better.

"GlobalTalk","t5_mg3b6","As another American in NC, I completely disagree on the first point about health care. Maybe its because my wife and I have put off major medical needs, tried to ration meds, turned down employee insurance because of the costs and lack of benefits. 

2. My wife is in medical field and has a background in micro biology. We have completely bungled Covid-19 at a federal level with calling it a ""Hoax"", and prior dismantling of resource stockpiles and institutions that existed to be prepared for this. The lack of decisive competent leadership made it so much worse on top of that, and is causing a good chunk of population to think its not a threat as it starts catching among them now. We could have stopped it relatively cold a month ago. Compare and contrast South Korea and the US, both had first cases on same day. SK is basically past it and in the clear aside from pockets. US hasn't even hit peak in most areas and the reopenings and lack of respect for nessecary precautions are going to throw oil on the fire. 100,000 Americans are dead. We could have prevented an estimated 70% of those deaths. 

3 and 4.  Statistically, not as much as any of us would like, and the videos/story's from a lot of the protests are showing that the police are often escalating the violence with them. No one is going to argue that the looting and burning is not horrible and bad. That said, look at how much peaceful protests have occured over the last decade, and the jeers and silence they've been met with, the lack of change and progress the protests have created. ""When you make peaceful change impossible, you make violent revolution inevitable"" - John F Kennedy.

And finally, news is supposed to be reality. It can be twisted and biased yes. But when most, and especially the more balanced and moderate ones, are saying the same thing, that's probably what is happening.",1590969662

Me and my ex-homie used to be cool. A couple arguments here and there, but that’s what all friends have. All though there was always one issue. He was so unforgiving, I would sometimes get some thing wrong, and he would not shut up about it for a week. Was just an asshole some days.

Recently, he texted me saying “if I asked you if you pranked me say yes” I was a little sketched out, but I went with it.

About two-three days later he calls me, here’s our convo:

Me: yo wassup

Friend: did you prank me?

Me: n- yea.

Friend: what did you do

Me: (going along with it) I think we all know

Friend: oh... well my uncle wants to talk to you

Pause. At this point I was confused, and way you skeptical 

Me: hello?

Friends uncle: hey I heard you were putting pornography on my nephews computer.

...

Me: ok, well there is no way I can do that. The last time I used teamveiwer, I was helping him with some pc settings. There’s no way I can remote it after that.

Yata yata yata, my dad gets on the phone, tells him how I can’t do it (he’s worked in It for 20+ years)

I haven’t really talked to him since, I’ve told not to fell guilty, and I don’t have a grudge against him. 

TLDR: friend accuses me of putting porn on his pc, uncle gets mad, my computer of a dad explains how I can’t do that. I’ve ignored my friend since

"X4Foundations","t5_3nn44","They're completely different games. X4 is definitely more of a sandbox that you can play in. If you want to build an empire via a map, it's the game for you. If you want a very high quality (space)flight simulator, get Elite. 

IMO both Elite and X4 have their own flaws, niches, and strengths. For example:

* X4 really gets ""stations over worlds"" right. In X4, looking down from a station and having a planet fill your screen is -amazing-. On the other hand, dogfighting in Elite within an asteroid field as the sun blinks out because the asteroid belt is rotating around the planet (moving you out of the path of the sun) is unparalled gameplay wise.
* You can build and staff your own stations in a mostly realistic economy in X4. You can walk around the stations! ... although they're really lacking in depth, and you can't really walk around your station in the way that ""walking around your station"" would lead you to believe. In Elite, you can't own your own stations in any sense (although the upcoming carriers will fill some, but not all, of that niche).
* The level of depth in the flight simulation in Elite cannot be understated. Your power plant generates power measured in MWs, it also outputs a corresponding amount of heat measured in BTUs. The more power you generate, the hotter your ship runs. Your module choices matter. The world is fully 3D in that there is truly no up or down in space. There's a fantastic amount of complexity and depth to shipbuilding in Elite. In X4, yes, you can move in the X, Y and Z directions, but the map only ""knows"" about X and Y. You can accelerate to 4km/s in the span of a second, and you can stop in a shorter amount of time. It is not a satisfying flight experience as compared to Elite.

To summarize this, X4 is more of a solo market simulator with some combat elements that happen to take place in space, Elite is more of a flight sim with almost no market (at least not compared to X4).

I've got 1700 hours of Elite and 1300 hours of X4. I play both of them, they both have pros and cons (as I've tried to highlight). It's really more of your personal preference as to which you'd enjoy more.

The last comment I'd make here is that Egosoft tends to push out very unfinished (or at a minimum, unpolished) games that they then polish up quite a bit. For example, I would absolutely NOT recommend X4 without the current DLC (as in, ""in my opinion, don't waste your time and money on the base game without the DLC""), and I'd add that once the next DLC is released, I'm sure I'll be saying the same about it. Elite started with a high quality flight sim but relatively bare universe, but it has had the benefit of years of iterative development and it shows. Elite is already a pretty high quality game, and if the rumors around the future plans of the game pan out, it's going to be an absolutely phenomenal game.

tl;dr buy and enjoy both for what they are",1590969663

You’ve discovered something that people who lose and gain weight all eventually discover — that if someone won’t date you when you’re fat, their interest in you when you’re thinner shouldn’t be trusted. Many, many people’s “love” is conditional on someone meeting a bunch of arbitrary physical standards that are fed to them by society.

This is why when a thin person’s thin partner makes negative comments about fat people, it’s smart to boot them out of the relationship. Every thin person is one health condition or medication away from significant, uncontrollable weight gain, and their “true love” will be out the door.",1590969665

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Well, if you want answers you should probably start with some questions. Also, try not to resent the chilly response too much. Self proclaimed feminists are responsible for quite a lot of what is considered male oppression, so some users of this subreddit are predisposed to disliking “your kind”.

As a general ramble, I’d start off by saying the vast majority of MRAs do not hate women. Hating feminists is not the same as hating women.

Much like our current police situation in the US, we do understand that “not all feminists” are purposely obstructing men’s gatherings and constructing laws in a way which exclude men; However, there is something to be said of guilt by association. Feminists like to use the “poison M&amp;M” example to justify their fear/hate of men, so we just apply the same logic back to feminists. You don’t have to be a bad feminist to have wronged men, standing idly by and complacent as your peers commit moral wrongs is just as bad.

Most MRAs are straight men still interested in pursuing a loving and equal relationship with women. Some are married, some are divorced, some are gay, some are women themselves. Men who have given up on women are by definition Men Going Their Own Way, and are not synonymous with MRAs, although there are plenty of MGTOWs that also support Men’s Rights.

There’s a lot to unpack when it comes to the MRA agenda. Some of us are more concerned about some issues than others, and we don’t have a unified leadership to steer the boat and drive activism.

Of the more popular issues, discrimination against men and leniency towards women in the criminal justice system and family courts is a hot topic. There’s also heated discussions about what constitutes as rape as a legal definition, and how male victims are often neglected from consideration or statistics.

Contraception and parental responsibility is another key issue. Women have more rights, protections, and options in this area than men. A key case here is when a statutory rapist later sued the boy she raped for child support, and won. I’m on mobile so I can’t easily provide citations, but the info is out there.

Bodily integrity is another sore issue, as many men (particularly in the US) are waking up to the fact that circumcision is largely unnecessary and can lead to life long complications. Again, women have protections here that men don’t.

The majority of MRA complaints would evaporate if we could simply re-write laws to be gender neutral for actual equality. Past that, recognizing that some women have sexist biases and treat men poorly because they are men is something that needs to be addressed. “\#KillAllMen” was never a joke, and similar trending social media tags should be treated as hate speech the same way a man promoting violence against women should.

Axis Followers can get things done. And because you can get things done, even if it doesn't go well, it's not your fault! It's society's fault that things don't work out! 

You can run away from unpleasant things! That doesn't mean you've lost! Because, as they say, ""Sometimes running away is winning""! 

The answer you come to after being in doubt is usually something you'll regret, no matter what you choose! If you're going to regret it anyways, do whatever's easiest for you in the moment! 

If criminals have human rights, then NEETS also have human rights! You should not be ashamed of being a NEET, nothing beats living through life without having to work! 

You need not to hold yourself back! Drink when you want, and eat when you want! Because you won't know if you'll be able to eat that again tomorrow! 

Do not fear growing old! Not even God knows whether or not you will be happy in the future, so you should, at least, be happy now! 

Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King! 

ERIS PADS HER CHEST!!!! 

Thou shalt love big breasts. Thou shalt love small breasts. Whether you're a lolicon or a NEET or a kemomimi lover, with the exception of undead or devil girls, as long as there is love and doesn't break the law, everything will be forgiven.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","yes technically it can, I lied to her, because as anybody in IT knows, if you give the PC illiterate any hope they will latch onto it and never let go no matter how many times you tell them a better solution.   


so yes technically it can but you have to replace almost everything inside the casing to install one of the modems they came out with later because of how the C64 handled the HDD. Or installing a bunch of 3rd party apps or replacing the original OS...and none of it would have helped her.  


She was trying to be able to keep in contact with her grandson through video chats....so first you have the complete lack of webcam...meaning I'd have to track down an old one that would work with the C64 (and yes there were a few) and hope to god it still worked and even if it did the video quality would be shit.   


And that's only if it could push the call which it absolutely would never do...the thing only has a (at the most) 1.023 MHz Processor (even the smallest processors today are 1000 times more powerful) and 64 kilobytes of RAM (we measure RAM in gigabytes now...even the smallest today is 2 million times bigger on average than a C64's RAM)   


And since Skype and Facebook are designed around the comparatively Kaiju-esque size and capabilities of modern hardware I lied to the old lady so she didn't spend up to possibly hundreds to Jurassic Park the C64 back into existence only for it to NEVER do what she needed the PC to do and got her to instead spend 10s on something new and more capable of doing what she needed it to do.

Water.  Use water.  Clean, potable water from a bottle nobody's drunk out of -- don't get mouth germs in people's eyes.  There are a few things which probably work about as well as water, but nothing works BETTER than water in the street context.

Normal saline solution would be as good -- technically, slightly better.  The official treatment for getting it in your eyes on the chemical data sheet is ""flush with saline for 20 to 30 minutes"".  In the street, where you're not doing it for 20 to 30 minutes, and you're just trying to get people's eyes clear enough that they can get out of the situation, the difference is not measurable.  Normal saline, Artificial Tears, whatever -- they are perfectly safe, but they're way more expensive, and not better in practical terms.  If you want to add eight teaspoons of salt to a gallon of water, that's fine, but, it's not gonna make enough difference to worry about.

Similarly, water with baking soda in it.  Nothing WRONG with putting a couple teaspoons of baking soda in a gallon of water, but it won't make much difference.

But there are actively bad ideas out there: there are people who have somehow come up with the ideas of pouring vinegar, lemon juice, or onion juice in their eyes.  Which, y'know, will make your eyes taste delicious, I suppose, but will clearly make things worse.

Milk is... not as clearly bad as those ideas.  But it's still a TERRIBLE IDEA.  Milk is a thing that some people are actually allergic to -- not just lactose intolerant, which isn't going to affect anything if milk is poured on you.  But some people are actually allergic to milk proteins, and anaphalaxys is kinda contraindicated, like, any time, but especially when you're already dealing with a lachrymator and bronchoconstrictor.  And MILK FREAKIN' SPOILS WITHIN A COUPLE HOURS IN THE SUMMER.  Pouring spoiled milk on someone is rude.

Then there's the granddaddy of ""can we do better than plain water""?  LAW -- Liquid Antacid and Water.  People still make it.  Even though the antacid which it was developed with is no longer made -- Maalox went out of business, then the trademark was bought, and the new antacid has different ingredients.  And some of it is flavored.  I don't want menthol poured into my eyes even if I DON'T have pepper spray trauma.

So... water.  Always water.",1590969669

A single saturated layer often looks flat but also all skin has multiple tones depending on the skin itself and lighting. Skin is also somewhat reflective and colours in the environment around your subject affect the colours on their skin in that moment. Various layers help gradually incorporate those colours. 

For mixing the actual colours you have to do it by referencing your own subject. There’s no formula for different skin colours because EVERYBODY’s different but looking up colour mixing videos will definitely help lots. I’ll just say the colours in skin are rarely the exact ones you expect to see and they’ll look completely different in even slight lighting changes so look closely and paint what you see instead of jumping right in assuming you know what colour to use.

In general, reddit has a bit of a ""punishment"" fetish, and not the fun kind. There are a lot of popular subreddits around revenge or ""karma"". What people seem to struggle with are basic moral concepts like punishment appropriate for the crime. Those communities may be both a symptom- and a cause of that problem on reddit, creating a feeling of moral superiority and the idea that you are capable of judging people and carrying out vigilante justice.

I think a lot of it has to do with an aspect of American culture that advocates violence as a solution to your problems. ""Stand your ground"" laws are dangerous as hell. They get people killed and I mean the people who are ""standing their ground"". Because a stressed civilian with a gun is a much greater threat to themselves than the people they want to shoot. But Americans still celebrate the idea of trying to defend their property when the very basic safety advice for any dangerous situation is: ""RUN first, hide if you can't run, call for help, only fight back if you have absolutely no other choice"". I also think, btw, that this aspect of American culture is the main reason for elevated firearm mortality rates, not so much the mere availability of guns but the willingness to use them.",1590969671

Yeah, some people win the genetics lottery and are born to like Bill Gates, and some people just get get straight up lucky in other ways like a mega viral app, or landing that big role in a hollywood movie or whatever, but saying that broadly speaking succesful people don't work hard for their success as an excuse to justify why you aren't succesful is, frankly, ridiculous.

We live in a time with very few gatekeepers, and almost all avenues of wealth creation has been truly opened up for everyone.

And no, I'm not talking about becoming the next Bezos or that level of wealth, I'm saying anyone can make millions and live the life they want if they're prepared to work for it.

People are making a ton of money on the internet, every day of the week, why should you be excluded from that opportunity?

All it takes is hard work - the information is already out there.

It's a compounding effect as well, once you start to grow your income and build disposable income your returns will compound as well, but it requires significant sacrifices in terms of time and money and regrettably, most people would prefer to watch netflix on the sofa and spend their money on material things that don't make them happy and crushes their disposable income, compound interest, and future growth.

It's a shame that the UK is so infested with this defeatist attitude that it's impossible to become wealthy without inheritance or luck, and this antagonistic jealousy towards the succesful. It's not making you happy, it's not making you more money, it's not contributing to your future growth, so why even have this world view? Being a pessimist in certain areas of life might have merits, but certainly not in this aspect.

"cataclysmdda","t5_2wktw","The skill level gates for cooking are kind of arbitrary and gamified. A good example would be cake. The cake recipe is just a chocolate cake. It has flour, salt, sugar, fats, egg, water, and chocolate. Children can make cakes with instructions, but in CDDA it's a level 6 cooking recipe. I interpret skill level 6 as being a middling to accomplished professional at something in most CDDA cases.

In my mind the ideal situation for the cooking skill would be to determine whether you screw up preparing the dish in some way. You try to make a cake at skill level 0 with a recipe, maybe it's a bit burnt or too salty. Or you screwed up the temperature and it didn't rise enough, or it's otherwise undercooked and the character doesn't realize that at first. If it's burnt nutritional value and morale takes a hit. Too salty? Quench and morale takes a hit, and you accidentally use more salt than the recipe calls for. Undercooked and it has gooey uncooked batter inside. Still edible, still nutritious, but morale effect is bad.

To /u/Zourin4's point it should also take longer, as an inexperienced cook takes longer to prep, is not acquainted to kitchen multitasking, doesn't know time-saving tricks, makes messes, etc.

I think a character of any cooking skill should be able to ATTEMPT creating a dish, provided they have the recipe. Let the chance not be a black and white die roll to see if they succeed or fail and *waste all resources*, but whether they succeed spectacularly or screw it up somehow, creating an inferior dish while wasting time and resources.

Auto-learned recipes could still be gated behind cooking skill, as any accomplished cook should be able to make certain things without a recipe.

I say all of this acknowledging that it would be a lot of work, and I would not be shouldering any of that burden. But if the new cooking skill DID work this way I think it would be glorious.",1590969671

i don't really watch anime a lot (The only anime that i watch is when is Dragon Ball or One Piece, or something with a huge production value is released)Black Clover manga is released with frequency on the book store in my city that's from where i get my books and manga

I do read Attack on Titan me and my sister share the books she buys one volume and i the next, and it goes on.

but yes i did a fast read on One Punch man its pretty good lol, a pain that i don't know a store that sells it near here, the volumes that i had read was over the internet and i don't enjoy Ebooks a lot, i prefer physical ones.

there's some mangas that i find phenomenal that are:

\- Claymore

\- Ubell Blatt 

\- Magi 

but i will check MHA if Dragon Ball fans like it must be at least full of action and charismatic characters and the store near here have some volumes",1590969672

&gt; Jack Dorsey, chief executive of Twitter, took to his site not long after to say Twitter would not back down, presenting a stark contrast to Mr. Zuckerberg, who, in an interview a day earlier with Fox News, said Facebook wasn&amp;#039;t going to judge Mr. Trump&amp;#039;s posts.

&gt; Mr. Zuckerberg&amp;#039;s reminder that Facebook would not interfere with posts from Mr. Trump - even if they violate rules that would apply to other people - was in part the product of his longtime belief that his company should avoid getting into the political fray and let its three billion users have their say.

&gt; Democrats are criticizing Mr. Zuckerberg&amp;#039;s unwillingness to enforce its policies, while Republicans are embracing an executive order handed down by President Trump that could make tech companies - including, and especially, Facebook - liable for the content that appears on their platforms.

Basically you can get any old clicker from the pet store. I got mine at petsmart for $2. 

I start off simple, using target training. Get a designated stick for this (chopsticks work great). You just put the stick in the cage near the bird, when the bird touches it, click the clicker and immediately give the bird a treat (usally id keep all millet outside of the cage and working for it is the only way the bird can get a treat). Repeat this a few times a day, moving the stick to different areas of the cage each time, do this so the bird gets a hang of it.

What i do next is put my hand in and around the outside of the cage for random amounts of time throughout the day so the bird is accustomed to it. Try holding millet when doing this to make him like you more, and hand feed him here and there when he starts becoming less timid. 

After this step I personally used luring. I held the food a little ways away and put my hand in the middle as a stepping stone. You can use your palm or your pointer finger for this. Let the bird get used to stepping on your hand in order to get his treat. Try not to jerk back quickly if he bites (that can startle him) dont worry, the bites can't break your skin and it's only a little pinch.

Once i had my bird used to my hand, i brought the clicker in. You lure the bird to your hand like in the last step but also click the button when his foot touches you. (At this point you would also be doing the target training semi-regularly so the bird understands that the sound= a treat). After a bit of this, the bird with learn to step on your hand when you put it near him (no luring needed) when he steps on your hand like this, again, just use the clicker and then reward him. This is the stage im at right now with my bird, i got her in april (it only took a while for her because she was previously living in horrible conditions).

But yeah, those are the steps to get the bird to step up on your hand, overtime he should get more and more accustomed to being around you and you can eventually teach more complex things. I learned most of this from the youtuber [BirdTricks](https://m.youtube.com/user/BirdTricks) shes a really great teacher and I highly recommend checking out her content :)",1590969672

Stay in if possible.

Either you think that all of Israel is part of some kind of conspiracy and that no one ever criticizes the IDF or the government (which if that's the case then you haven't spoken to Israelis) or the entire media is not trustworthy. 

Not only that but your ""trustworthy"" news outlet is from the AE which is routinely and irrationally anti-israel. That doesn't mean that your article is wrong or false but you can't call Israeli news on Israel untrue and then cite the AE. 


As per my original comment, everyone I've talked to about the George Floyd murder called it just that, a murder. Believe it or not, not everybody agrees with the Israeli military or government's action or decisions. Somehow it has become ok to think that all Israelis support everything Israel has ever done as if we are not a democracy. You don't see us blaming every random American ( or wherever you live) for something their government does. You must realize that would be the same as assuming some random person in Nowhere, Kentucky is responsible and supports George Floyd's death. 

I understand your pov but I don't have to agree with it and no offense but I don't have to trust it either.

"answers","t5_2qkeh","I think you're mistaken about Marx, Stalin, and Mao. Marx said very little about communism, and you might be thinking of a statement where he was idealizing pre-industrial life as hunting, fishing, and composing poetry. But this wasn't a description of communism. 

The German Marxism and Russian socialism was actually pro-industrial. The rapid modernization of Russia after the revolution evinces this. The major theorist of communism as it was a practiced political ideology was Lenin. The idea of socialism for Marxist-Leninists, which was the path to the eventual utopia of communism, was that society would industrialize, things would be easier to make, mechanization would eliminate the skilled division of labor, and workers would collectively manage production. As people became empowered to direct their own political affairs, political hierarchy would become unnecessary, so the state would wither away. 

Maoism extolled the virtues of agarian life in a way that European Marxism and Leninism did not. German Marxists thought that revolution would be urban, occurring in the most developed areas as a consequence of progress. Maoism was very anti-urban. I don't really know why, so I can't answer that. The most extreme example of anti-urban socialist revolution was the Khmer Rouge which forcibly depopulated cities, sent people to work on collective farms, and shot people who wore glasses because they saw literacy as a threat to authentic agrarian living.",1590969673

Another part of it is that the government can end these protests in one day with force, but the choose not to. this is because the first amendment gives them the right to peacefully protest. During the protests right now, 90% of the people are peaceful. The other 10% are the ones looting and rioting. (The ones your head about on the news). The government can’t end a protest because of 10% of people. They can’t try and scare people away, but they can’t outright end it. So the protests have to go on, otherwise it would be a infringement on the 1st amendment. Because the government lets the protest continue, there will be some people who get violent, and it is up to the citezens to defend them selfs (by whatever means necessary) because the cops are not always available because they may be keeping the peace elsewhere. 

From what I have seen in European 
Protests (correct me if I’m wrong) that when a group of people get violent the entire protest is shut down. But here in America the government doesn’t shut it down because it would be a infringement on thoes who are peaceful

- Las AFP no se quedan con esa plata, el sistema de capitalización individual en palabras simples es una cuenta de ahorros personal obligatoria, el dinero que se junta siempre será tuyo y si te mueres ese dinero se hereda porque es tuyo. Nadie puede tocarla porque la constitución actual no le permite al estado adueñarse de los ahorros de los chilenos, a diferencia con argentina que con la constitución que tienen les dan mayor poder al estado. Históricamente a argentina ya le sucedió esto con “el corralito”. Y el sistema de reparto históricamente se comprobó que es una estafa piramidal que no se puede sostener en el tiempo, sobre todo en un país con mucho adulto mayor y en un sistema de reparto si te mueres tus hijos no podrán heredar nada porque el dinero no es tuyo. Solo quise aclarar un poco tu pregunta de que pasaba con los ahorros. En resumen el dinero es tuyo y si te mueres tu esposa e hijos heredan ese dinero. Es el sistema que ha funcionado mejor en la realidad. De todas maneras creo que es un sistema que se podría mejorar mucho más. Pero no veo otro sistema viable en verdad. Los NO+AFP no han pensado bien que otro sistema podría ser mejor para los chilenos. Aunque estoy de acuerdo de que debería haber más libertad en que hacer con tus ahorros también debería existir una responsabilidad. Porque si no existe la responsabilidad y todos se gastan sus ahorros te conviertes automáticamente en una carga para el estado. Y si sucediera con muchos chilenos a la vez no habría suficientes fondos fiscales y nos vamos a la quiebra. Y un consejo, en esta época donde la información está al alcance de muchos la ignorancia es solo una excusa. San googlee te puede explicar con peras y manzanas todo lo que necesites saber. No soy un experto en economía ni he profundizado mucho en los ahorros, pero creo qué hay una base de conocimiento mínimo que deberíamos tener.

"bettafish","t5_2udkc","I wish I could help more with the specific issue, but I'm fairly unfamiliar with that sort of lump. 

However, just a few things I saw in your tank that could be weakening him: 

You've got it too cold. A betta's tank should be around 78-80 degrees. 

You also should almost never do a 50% water change like that. It really stresses the little guys out. Instead, do weekly 20% water changes. 

Also, this isn't something you could know, and I'm going to sound weird, but hear me out: STOP changing your filter. Like, immediately. No more touching it. 

You see, the box says to replace it monthly, but that's to make money. The company doesn't really care about your fish. Most of the beneficial bacteria in a fish tank lives IN the filter media. By replacing it, you've destroyed that bacteria and your cycle. 

From now on, all you need to do is whenever you do a water change, take some of the water from his tank that you siphoned out and gently rinse the filter cartridge in there to get some gunk off. Then put it right back in. 

I hope some others can help you with the specific issue of your fish! But those little changes should make a big quality of life improvement for him.

**Edit:** If he makes it, you'll want to immediately get a freshwater testing kit (preferably the API one),  and research how to do a fish-in cycle. You'd probably need to cycle his tank again with the big water changes and filter replacing.",1590969677

"shopify","t5_2sn78","Mainstream dropshipping right now is such a bad business model. Unless toute actively working on branding etc you’re adding no value to the production process, instead you’re taking away by charging customers a higher price for an item they could just find somewhere else cheaper; with no added benefit. There’s no way this is sustainable long term, customers won’t go back to a store that took nearly 3 months to delivery with poor customer service, an unbranded poor quality product shipped in a tiny envelope with a bunch of chinese writing on it with a weird smell.

You can make money from it in the short run but what’s the purpose of it’s not sustainable? that’s why i don’t agree with this model of business. It’s just a rollercoaster of highs and lows, one day you’re thriving doing 50k a month next you’re doing close to nothing, just look at the shopify exchange.

With this type of business model to your revenue correlates almost directly to your marketing spend. Just unsustainable.

If you want to drop ship, especially from china, you really need to innovate and make sure you’re adding value to the item you’re selling.

Otherwise good luck lasting for anything more than just a bunch of short term highs

It was essentially a walkthrough, but funnily enough, the idea that it could be seen as cheating never really crossed my 8-year-old mind - I saw it as more of an instruction manual for assistance if I ever got stuck. 

I'd also lay in bed at night and flick through the pages of the walkthrough to look ahead at all the cool areas near the end of the game to see what awaited me later on, and it would blow my mind. Apparently I had no concept of spoilers either, haha - but the process of actually reaching and playing through those areas always ended up being so different from the brief glimpses of them I got through screenshots.

The police specifically are given basically free reign to mistreat anyone they please without any repercussions. Even charging that asshole who killed floyd is given third degree murder.

Even *if* specific height comparison was a reliable or sensible way to judge kids' ages, Pan isn't Goku, and she's a quarter-Saiyan instead of a full-blood. There's no reason whatsoever to believe they'd be the same height at the same age.

As unsettling as it might be, how *Bra* dresses has no bearing on how old she is. Plus, restating the height thing, *Bra*'s age compared to Pan does not dictate their respective heights. Also, while her bio in Daizenshuu 7 did suggest that *Bra* was born in Age 778, the timeline feature in that same book says *Bra* was born in 780 instead, after Pan in 779. The GT Perfect Files also say 780 for *Bra*, and now of course Super has shown *Bra* born about a year after Pan too. So it's safe to assume the D7 bio made a mistake. 

If nobody was aware of any of this, then I couldn't blame them for thinking *Bra* is the older one just by looks. But we do have more information and it tells us that's not the case. *Bra* is younger than Pan.",1590969678

Just because someone commits a crime and is of a certain profession, race, gender, political affiliation, religion, or nationality does not mean ""all"" people of that category are guilty of all these crimes.

However, a lot of people disagree with me because we **love** to blanket blame groups. We like it because it's easy to point fingers and a whole group and say ""you're all like that"". However, that way of thinking is actually part of the roots on sexism, racist, islamophobia, and so much more.

We have to stop sweeping groups under a category and marking them for attacking, and we have to stop letting radicals define a group. That's how fake news and Russian propaganda want you to think.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","The biggest thing that games have going for them is interactivity, that is what creates an investment into the story for the player that movies never can. And one of the most commonly-repeated platitudes about the Uncharted games back when they were new is that it ""felt like you were playing an action movie."" It was a pretty novel experience that only opened up with that new level of hardware tech from the PS3 and people really enjoyed it. Now for Naughty Dog in particular this does have some problems with ludonarrative dissonance in the way the characters behave in cutscenes vs gameplay but that's kind of another discussion entirely. Metal Gear Solid however is one of the most shining examples of the true strength of the video game medium because of how it directly involves the player and passively acknowledges the experience of actually playing a video game. This is exemplified in a wealth of different codec conversations across the series, particularly at the end of MGS2 when shit goes real sideways, but at no greater point than the ending of MGS3 when those black cutscene bars softly, cruelly pull away and the final kill is left to you and you alone. Anyone who has played this game knows exactly what I'm talking about. A movie will NEVER be able to do that.

To put it another way, if a game does NOT make good use of its elements of being a game, then it can basically for all intents and purposes be judged as a movie or tv show. And typically the stories of most of these games do not hold up on a level of narrative complexity or depth that the best movies do. So now it sort of answers the question you're asking: ""Why shouldn't that narrative-driven game have been a movie? Well because if it were a movie it would have been a shitty one."" So games are typically incentivized to generate their emotional impact by either giving you direct agency over the outcome of the story and fates of the characters, or by building a personal connection and investment in the survival and well-being of these characters that is more direct because you are controlling or interacting with them.

Nobody's going around just deleting every non-revolutionary game from existence. But critics gonna criticize. People will find the weak points of games and point out what could have made them better, or question why something was the way it was. That's just what happens with all art. If a game is very light on the elements that make it a game, people will zero in on that and question it. Honestly I think very few games truly fit that bill though.",1590969680

"Hydroponics","t5_2qsim","Hi there. I grow cannabis hydroponically (and legally) so I can help you somewhat, hopefully.

To give you a very basic explanation... 

Seeds/seedlings typically first sprout in what’s called a rock wool cube (1 seed per cube). These are cheap wool like cubes that retain moisture, perfect for the high humidity plants in the beginning stages require. 

After some time, the rock wool cubes, along with the sprouted cannabis plant, are placed in a controlled environment in whats called a net-pot that acts as a lid for a container containing an aerated nutrient solution (clean water mix with hydroponic plant nutrients). Inside the net-pot are pellets called hydroton, or essentially expanded clay pellets soaked in PH adjusted water. 

Eventually the main tap-root grows out of the bottom of the rock-wool, down through and around the hydroton, past the net-pot and into the nutrient solution below. Once the root reaches the nutrient solution below growth explodes. 

Nutrient solutions are changed weekly or bi-weekly as salt build-up in the water can cause issues after some time.

As the plant reaches different stages in it’s life time, nutrient solutions will become more or less potent as nutrition needs change. This can be done by monitoring the total dissolved salts (TDS) or electrical conductivity (EC). Solution potential of hydrogen (PH) also needs to contantly monitored as nutrients will not be up-taken outside of the range of 5.5-6.5. 


Before harvest the nutrient solution is removed and replaced with clean water (no nutrients) or clean water with a “flushing” agent. Flushing a hydroponic plant is a quicker process than with soil (2-4 days) as all available nutrients are removed and the plant is forced to use energy / nutrients stored in the foliage. This is a controversial task, but it’s widely accepted that flushing cannabis plants provides an easier and more pleasurable smoke. 

Hydroponics can be a difficult task. To be successful you typically need to be “dialled in”. This means you understand exactly the nutrient &amp; environment needs of the specific strain you’re attempting to grow. This usually takes trial and error. Because of this, hydroponic growers typically grow a strain they are familiar with.",1590969680

"canada","t5_2qh68","Your one point was that the comparison is faulty because an aristocrat is of a higher class.  In the context of an aristocracy being of a higher social class would mean they have legal rights and privileges that a lower class doesn't, as well as having duties and responsibilities that a lower class wouldn't.  Owners and shareholders both have powers and privileges that an employee doesn't, as well as having additional responsibilities and duties.

However, that wasn't my reasoning in my initial statement, it is that decision making power is much more concentrated amongst fewer persons in an aristocracy, which is similar to capitalism because ultimate decision making powers lies with the owners of a company.

I had already acknowledged that the analogy was imperfect, but I don't think that you've provided a valid reason for why equating an owner with an aristocrat is unfair or improper, and stated why I disagree.

Unless you think it's an unfair comparison because you think that an aristocracy is inherently bad, but then I'd have to ask what you'd like me to use as a analogy instead.",1590969681

Honestly it sounds like this is EU because rarely NA LFG asks for 250 LI for a strike mission. Raid LFG in NA is really slow. And the average lfg is 30kp in NA which is depending on the drop rate of the kp is about 7-8 kills on the boss they are asking for. I guess training till you get 8 kills of a boss is just so hard to do. 

I do agree that Arenanet needs to make a lfg system where it instantly fills however, I don’t see it ever happening because people avoid trying harder in gw2. Every game has a goal to reach for the end. Idk why it’s so hard for people in gw2. Stop complainin and gets da gamin.",1590969682

House was built in 1920's (before mechanical dryers), and dryer was in the basement, but up on a little platform (24-30""), so, the vertical ducting didn't need to be so long.

The first time I used it to dry towels, I went back down, after about an hour, and there was steam coming out of the door, and they were still pretty wet.  I asked my friend (who was a physics major, and prided himself on his mechanical skills, as well as his intellect), and he said, ""I don't worry about it: it gets the clothes dry!""

Next time I washed a load, I took a little time, and checked out the vent duct, and found that it was clogged over a foot up from the first elbow!  Almost 2 feet of ductwork FULLY blocked!

That's limited more to private conversations, I know that it's worthless to actually try to change the minds of the people rioting, but so many people I know have framed it as, ""if you don't support the riots, you don't support black people/their struggle/the movement"", and I reject that equivalency. The only reason that the anti-riot opinion rather than the pro-change position seems stronger here, is because we're discussing the riots. And on those, my opinion is that rioting is bad -- and in response to those that say it's bad for the purposes of good, I say what I said above, that rioting has the potential to push potential allies away from your cause. I'll admit I'm a bit hypocritical, as personally these riots in particular were the driving factor for me to get involved, while before I didn't really bother. But, I think that riots tend to push more people away than they pull in, and the paper seems to support that.

"loreofleague","t5_2xuqg","A few counterpoints:

&gt; The first point- we are to believe that Fiddlesticks was born at the start of creation, as were most if not all Celestials. He and the other primordials existed far before Runeterra and is described as a demon before demons were known(similar to how aspects were gods before the concept of gods were known.) 

The exact wording is ""given life in that first terrible scream of creation"". The Void's region description has similar wording:

&gt; Screaming into existence with the birth of the universe, the Void is a manifestation of the unknowable nothingness that lies beyond. 

Except in the Void's case, we have [reason to believe they only ""screamed"" when Runeterra was made](https://twitter.com/LaurieGoulding/status/1257850103894667266). This would also tie Fiddle into Runeterra. Also, as the previous tweet on that chain indicates, the concept of ""life"" as we know it is actually Runeterran-specific, the beings of the Celestial Realm are not exactly alive in the same way mortals are. 

Similarly, the description given by the writer was:

&gt; [The team loved the more serious tone and the new Fiddlesticks became ""a primordial entity that predates the rise of civilization,"" Rosen said. Building its body out of random items and piecing itself together in the shape of the humans it doesn't understand, Fiddlesticks is a ""creature of pure emotional instinct that was created from the formless negative energy endemic to all life.""](https://www.newsweek.com/how-league-legends-developers-put-fright-back-fiddlesticks-1492589)

Note how the specific term is predating the rise of *civilization* as opposed to the entire world and how it is born of life's energy and emotions, both things which tie to the Spirit Realm.

&gt; the second point - we know know that Fiddlesticks represents fear and has always said his fear was of the known while nocturne was fear of the paranoia(the unknown). but if Fiddlesticks were to be a celestial then this wouldn't have to be the case. Pantheon for example was the aspect of war at the same time Volibear was. we know Aspects are essential concepts and aspects of the universe made manifest, but we've only heard of more positive concepts. war, protection, twilight(change), justice, sun and moon. but those aren't the only aspects of the world. we have fear, we have rage, we have greed, suffering, etc. so if there are aspects of good that have all grouped together as Targonians, Whose to say there isn't a host of Aspects that represent the darker side of existence? that what if they are the other 9 primordial demons are just 9 other dark aspects?

Not sure if you can so broadly paint the Aspects or what they represent as good. All concepts can be twisted and all of these absolutes can become a threat. I would agree they are mostly on humanity's side but the Celestial Realm need not abide by our definitions of morality.

More importantly, consider the concepts our Aspects represent. There is no emotion in them. They are detached abstractions as opposed to subjective feelings, and we already know the latter is the domain of the Spirit Realm. 

&gt; third point- if Fiddlesticks was to be an Aspect he'd have to follow the same rules that all other Aspects do and so far he does. for one, he cannot interact in the material world without a host. yet he does with his scarecrows. no one said the host has to be a living being, and targonians already have there own method of (albeit permanently ) breathing life into an inanimate object with the darkin weapons. Fiddlesticks is clearly not the scarecrow, but in the cage controlling it.

But we've already seen spirits possess objects before and everytime we do see a spirit, it's actually just a physical vessel they have created, except most demons actually understand humanity and want to optimize their process whereas Fiddles is just using whatever to mimic the form of man. The best celestial parallel for Fiddlesticks that you could make is Bard but even that ignores that there's nothing about Fiddle that contradicts what we know of demons. They even made an effort to tie his color scheme closer to what would be expected of one (and of Raum).
 
&gt;  in fiddlesticks bio it's magic is described alien, foreign, and an unknown form of magic which fits the bill of celestial magic, the least understood and used of the three schools of magic with only veigar and a few of mordekaisers undead being the only non-targonian affiliated users of it. outside of them was Shurima( who is targon affiliated) The mountain people that bard visited( who were Bard related) and Lissandra sister who's name i forgot who was stick mute for attempting to use it. 

The sister is Serylda. But it's important to note that, where almost all contemporary knowledge comes from demons shaped and defined by mankind, inherently tied to their modern cultures and rules and civilizations, Fiddle is a remnant of something older, and the Spirit Realm is all about the subjectivity of it, the legends and myths that go into something, demons have evolved, Fiddle has not.

&gt;  but they are unknown. as is FIddlesticks, but the difference is no one can talk to his vessel because he'll just kill you. so it's easier to say it doesn't think and it's mindless. but it clearly can. and it has a dark sense of humor even without surpise party fiddlesticks. quoting dying people is fucked up and only if you found joy in the kill would you do something like that. he's mocking you. it mocks nearly everyone it hunts. telling Garen for demaicia as he lays there dying isn't scaring him, it's mocking his suffering. 

I wouldn't agree with this. Fiddlesticks is, effectively, fear itself. Its way of understanding the world is via fear, it learns, it acts, always via fear. It does not realize the weight of its words, it may not even realize what words are, but it is trying to. It built a form in the shape of a man, I do not think this is for mocking, but for learning. It is confused. Similarly, we know it is barely even [self-aware](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo/status/1240003688346693632), which matches the earlier quote of how it's ""pure emotional instinct"". Remember also that Fiddle's ""only joy"" was taken away, murders are not it.

More importantly, I would say, is that Fiddle is ""alive and dead"" and I would take this to mean that it lacks a brain (just like the Scarecrow in Oz and just like its old quote, which lived on in Surprise Party). 

&gt; this bring me to surprise party fiddlesticks. like pantheon, most of his skins are just other vessels which means they are still the same spirt.

This is just incorrect, Pantheon's skin lines are not canon and do not represent previous hosts, neither are Fiddle's. You could say things like ""Fiddle Me Timbers could kinda look as it does in Bilgewater"" but the skins themselves are not canon and are clearly tied with AU lore in descriptions. Surprise Party does have canon relevant lines but is not wholly canon and [this was made for clarity](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo/status/1251262544347422721).

&gt; if there were really some kind of Dark Aspect, it would only make sense for Targon to want them gone.

It would make sense for Targon to want *any* threat gone, they clearly have vested interest in Runeterra. And we know from Lissandra's bio that the Celestial Realm entered in conflict with the Spirit Realm from very early on. 

Before Fiddlesticks came out, I posited that he could be an ""Anti-Aspect"", where the Aspects represent fundamental pillars of creation, Fiddlesticks would be a herald to powers that represent things that Creation is not (not the Void, instead, concepts that didn't ""make it in"" to the fabric of reality and that are therefore beyond human comprehension, things that we would understand only in broken terms that defy logic and reasoning, things like 2+2=5). I pictured him as the anti-Bard in a lot of ways.

But, I do not think this is the case. He has been clearly positioned as a demon (and called as much by his writer multiple times) and is all about emotions (a critical part of the Spirit Realm). He doesn't need to be a Celestial to be cosmically-relevant, as the point of Runeterra is that it is where all previous rules are broken, to the point where Celestials can die and the Watchers can be made to ""live"".",1590969685

I didn't understand why he'd gave it to me, I thought maybe he was putting it in gas and when I chased him out with the $200 and asked him what he wanted me to do with it, he looked at me and he said just try to make your niece and nephews Christmas a little better, that he knew that this isn't much and he knew it won't take away the pain of them losing their mom but maybe it'll help a little.

I've found personally that I can use Fresnos in the same way and that I much prefer the flavor. They are obviously hotter than bell peppers, but they are still mild enough to cool off a fiery sauce, and they actually taste like they belong in a hot sauce.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. 

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. 

You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

However, considering their activity is concentrated outdoors, most are wearing masks, and most are young (20s and 30s) and presumably in adequate health, there probably won't be a doomer-esque spike that r/coronavirus is rooting for. Furthermore, assuming at least some protesters get COVID which I don't think is too outrageous of a prediction, their symptoms will by and large be either non-existent or so mild that they don't even bother getting a test.

My motto is I will not ever to do my ex what I wouldnt want him doing to me. You are livid your ex gave your son a benadryl without telling you but you admit you have repeatedly withheld medical information from him. Respect is a 2 way street.

Why do you still see 7 policemen on 1 peaceful blackguy, tasers for nothing, shots for nothing, murders for nothing.
After prolly hundreds of peaceful protests and several riots nothing has been done. Well very little, I heard 1 police department shifted focus in training to deescalation and minimal force and that has seemed to help. but thats the miniscule minority.

I acknowledge that you can never stop this issue 100% because there will always be bad apples. But that still today these bad apples can kill someone and get off with close to 0 consequences. After all this. Its insane.

Personally I would be a peaceful protestor as I dislike violence, but I dont think I can condemn rioters when peacefull protesting has had close to no effect.

I'm not about to beat up on people I've never met, but I will point out that as people get older, the likelihood of them having baggage/ having been burnt and scared gets higher and higher with time. 

What I think is a bigger problem: Thanks to Tinder, online dating has become more of a livestock auction rather than an opportunity to actually learn something about a human being before meeting them on a date.  

Personally- Bumble leaves very little room for people to write about themselves.  I used to learn A LOT about a guy based on both what he DID write, and what he DIDN'T write.

Now the law says different, and if you're standing there watching a looting, you won't be charged with a crime. It is why the other cops won't get a first degree murder charge against them.

"toxicology","t5_2rod5","ACMT has a mentoring program worth checking out if you don't have any toxicologists at your institution. Your question is a little complicated to answer. Being a medical toxicologist is relatively open ended with multiple career paths, some better paved than others. It's not clear which of those paths you are looking to explore. Do you want no clinical duties? Do you want no clinical emergency medicine duties? Do you want part-time clinical duties? What do you mean by research? Pipetting and animal models? Drug trials? Clinical research?

The job market for an emergency medicine trained toxicologist wanting to practice academic emergency medicine is fairly good outside those cities with a fellowship program. The job market gets tighter as you get more specific about what you want from the job (pay, location, buy-down away from the ED to do other work, number of other toxicologists around, etc). There are a number of clinical avenues as a toxicologist that can get you away from the emergency department (bedside consults, inpatient team, addition medicine work, occupational medicine, etc). There are non-clinical avenues doing educational work, research, policy, legal consulting, etc. The challenge is that few of these things will pay as well as clinical emergency medicine which means institutional support will often be lacking and you're now looking at more of an entrepreneurial endeavour than filling a defined niche that an institute is hiring you for. 

I would not count on a Poison Center Director position which is typically the only way to derive a large percentage of your income from working for a poison center. There are not many of these positions and there are often already many people waiting in line for the spot. The odds aren't abysmal, particularly if you're willing to move around the country, but I wouldn't count on it. You can certainly provide medical back-up but this generally isn't going to pay enough to greatly affect your overall income compared to shifts in the emergency department.

If you're wanting a career mostly doing clinical trials or basic science research, coming from a medical toxicology background, you're entering a niche too obscure to really have a big pool of dat to draw from. The toxicology fellowship gives you great clinical training but you'll be playing catch-up on the research side of things. I'm not sure the fellowship would help you more than just getting training and experience in study design/basic science research.

TLDR: The market is great for someone who wants to be an academic emergency physician serving as the token toxicologist in the department. The market is pretty good for someone wanting to be an academic emergency physician with support to do some clinical toxicology and the token research of academic medicine. Moving away from clinical emergency medicine, and even more so if moving away from clinical medicine in general, will require significantly more entrepreneurship and likely a significant sacrifice in salary.",1590969693

There are some nice examples around £6k with 80 thousand miles or so. It's a lot - but if the car has been well serviced and maintained, then I would do it as a sucker for BMW induced punishment. I would obviously prefer lower, but the budget is low, so you will have to be a bit lucky around £6k.

Your best option - outside of sweet talking your way out! - is to charge and the armed party misfires, panics or hits an extremity you can worry about after the gun is knocked out of their hand.",1590969694
"SaltLakeCity","t5_2r7ac","Marijuana legalization is a cornerstone to any type of criminal justice reform. Marijuana is often the excuse used to stop POC. It’s often the first charge that gets you in the system. On probation so they can get you on violations. Keep you in the system so you can never get out. They see possession on your record and search you, or use it as an excuse to search your car.

If police wanna have a conversation about how to move beyond what happened yesterday then they can start by de-prioritizing marijuana enforcement laws. Then they can join us in lobbying the legislature to legalize marijuana in Utah.

"Dentistry","t5_2rpgi","Hi! 

First of all ensure you are following standard oral hygiene. Brush 2x a day with fluoridated toothpaste, trying to spit not rinse afterwards and brushing for a good amount of time, ideally with an electric toothbrush. I am sure you are already covering this but trust me that any dental work will last longer if the OH is at its finest!

Second. Be wary of dental tourism. A lot of dentists refuse to touch extensive work done abroad or will charge a lot for this. So whatever you do make sure you can always go back for any repairing easily.

Third. As you said you are a very nervous patient. Many dentists offer sedation and im sure they will help you. Try to look at sedation as way back into confidence on the chair and on your dentist. One or two sessions will probably only cover the basics. If you want full arch work that will take more sessions. I would advise against this approach too. You are 30. Very young and healthy and with a bright life ahead of you! Any tooth that can be saved within reason, should be saved. If you choose extensive work now, it might start to fail by the time you are 50 or so and then require pricier options to fix, possibly. 

Do not give up. Build up your relationship with a dentist you like. Take things slow and you might surprise yourself and eventually not even need sedation. This happens to a lot of patients! I have seen patient wearing earplug, earphones with music on, bringing someone with them, etc. These things can help.

There could be the option of having braces (orthodontics) to reposition your teeth and then have them whitened. This is a very non invasive procedure and might take your smile to where you want.",1590969695

It does give you an option to submit questions to coaches, and they provide great feedback, but that’s as personal as it gets. The resources are great, but a lot of it is offered to podcast listeners eventually.

"DID","t5_2s73v","I can only speak for my own experience, but never being truly valued or loved for who we were, throughout childhood, has meant that we couldn't provide that for our littles without it first being provided by someone outside of us. How could we give something to our littles or any of ourselves if nobody inside has ever truly believed that we're valuable?

So the process for us has been to first build trust with the therapist and believe that he is always honest and genuine, and then to struggle with believing that he means it when he says he likes and cares about us. That has sunk in very slowly, because at first we would keep saying, ""but if you really knew us, you wouldn't like us!""

Now that he is finally gaining the trust of one of our fiercest and most emotional protectors (who is also emotionally VERY young), we have a more consistent sense of the therapist's caring, and that is what comforts the littles. Knowing he is there and *always* sorry and sad if they feel upset. (They still need to hear it over and over though, it's certainly not a done deal by any means.)

We've been seeing him for almost three years, and only just had an experience of truly being able to comfort a little ourselves in a way they could take in and believe. 

So that's why my answer keeps coming back to your therapist. Not feeling valuable or worthy of love is *relational trauma,* that is very hard (impossible?) to heal without working it out with an outside person (a therapist).",1590969696

this is not a good trait in a spouse, and it would be a dealbreaker for me. It's a minor behavior, but it happens again and again and just repeatedly seems to interfere in the relationship. all because of his ego and need to resist you. 

I have no advice - but I sympathize with you and your feelings are totally legitimate. 

how long have you been together? 

if he wants to be your partner, I mean a true partner to you, then he needs to get over himself and his ego, and help you with things according to the way they need to be done. you two are partners, equals, and are trying to share a life together. 

being a good partner means that you do things for your partner (the way they want them to be done) just because you love them and you want to support them, not out of any sense of perceived subservience. Actives of service are a big love language, or maybe they arent for some people - but having a partner who is completely opposed to acts of service, and sabotages them a tiny bit every time, will gradually poison the relationship.",1590969696

"HollowKnight","t5_35gpe","The RNG that’s getting me in this fight is Galien himself. He can move up, down, left, right, and any of those in between without warning and he deals contact damage. I’ve literally had times where I’ve ran underneath, abyss shrieked, and then die to him suddenly going straight down in the middle of my shriek. I’ve had times where he’s running to the right so I jump up to hit and him and he suddenly starts heading to the left and hits me. I’ve had time where I’ll dodge underneath the big scythe and in the middle of my dodge he’ll drop down to ground level so that once I exit shadow dash I’ll be inside his hitbox.

I think games should be balanced around the hardest difficulty because of fights like Galien, Markoth, or Oblobble. This fights are designed around you getting hit and trading damage. You can tell this because there are frequent situations in which damage is literally unavoidable, descending dark, jump, run, dodge, it doesn’t matter. You WILL get hit. But normally it’s fine because they deal 1-2 damage, so you can recover. But now, when you’re getting one shot, these unavoidable situations end the run. I’ve heard that they nerfed the collector, as originally his minions took two hits even with a strength charm. If that’s the case, that’s an excellent example of a boss who was difficult normally, and straight up broken on radiant, and so they nerfed him, because even though people were fighting him on the hardest difficulty, he was unfairly balanced.

It’s important to remember that hardcore games shouldn’t JUST be hard. I could make a boss that take 30 minutes to kill and one shots with every single, lightning fast attack, but that doesn’t make it a good boss. A boss needs to be both challenging and fair, and Galien is one of those bosses that just feels completely unfair when he decides to just fuck you over. Honestly if his AI were to just have him constantly fly towards you the entire fight, trying to deal contact damage non-stop while everything else is going, he’d be unbeatable, well *sometimes* you’ll get unlucky and exactly that will happen. There were times I’d have no issue getting to phase 3, there were times where I’d die in phase 1. The fights entire difficulty is centered around what Galien does. Either it’s a fun and challenging fight if he doesn’t crash into, or it’s fucking enraging when you’re doing good and Galien just says “stop” and bumps into you.",1590969698

They will have seen some combat prior, fighting his summons. This is also worst case scenario. They don't detect and dispel the alarm spell. They all rush in at once. Nobody scouts ahead.

Best case scenario, they dispel the alarm, sneak up on the caster, get a surprise shot on him, while being able to see him and the other enemies, which he is commanding in the event of intruders.

The other enemies (a couple skeletons and one or two wights) are hidden behind crevices in the wall of the cavern. (Players will also be able to use this) or underneath a stream ready to ambush if not seen.

"MadeMeSmile","t5_2uqcm","Hey I completely agree with what you’re saying. There are many different opinions on this out there. Not just ioannidis saying this though. The diamond princes data suggested that large amounts of people had been completely asymptomatic, and total mortality was 13 of 2800 or so (from memory), and this was an elderly population so even worst case looking like 0.45 mortality for a primarily elderly cohort, which is roughly in line with age adjusted flu deaths for a similar outbreak in a similar situation. Oxford professor released statistical analysis showing that the disease may have spread far and wide then imperial college London released their theories which took a far more conservative approach. Conservative approach won out. Here I agree the right thing is to take a conservative approach until we know better, but this was a month ago or more now. We need to make data driven decisions. The data from lots of antibody studies is coming in now and suggests this virus is not that lethal compared to say flu. You can google antibody studies and there are loads of them happening currently showing all the same thing (where results are available).

Here’s the clincher though: we were making decisions before based on guesses and almost no data on total exposures. So saying ioannidis or other researchers have not provided enough data is on one hand true, it’s not really enough, but on the other hand it’s more than we had before. So if we are going off the best data it’s limited but we should change based on that.

Other point about vaccines - quickest ever was Ebola and that took 4 years. I’d like to be optimistic but there are things you can’t rush. In order to see if someone has antibodies still there at six months you have to wait six months... there is no proxy for it. And you have to do animal model testing first really, before the human stuff as coronavirus vaccines have a history in the animal models of causing an overreaction whereby those immunised had worse outcomes. Coronaviruses have also been the target of vaccines before and this was also unsuccessful, although like you say on a different scale. Personally I oscillate between it’s possible, and even likely and it’s not going to happen. But a year or two... that is possibly quite optimistic.",1590969699

If no, then a push towards Trump is highly concerning. Don't feed into the narrative that both sides are the same. An America under Biden is concerning and there desperately needs to be change and reform to the broken institutions of our country. An America under Trump? Even more concerning. 

Also, Minnesota might be a blue state but don't ignore the strong support there is for Republicans there. Pawlenty was a Republican Governor as recent as 2011 and Clinton carried the state by 1.5%, hardly an unassailable margin.

"CompetitiveWoW","t5_35p2p","I used to call out everything but now will generally only call out dynamic elements of the fight that require verbal coordination (e.g., which image to target on Skitra). I shifted after I repeatedly saw that raids went to shit any time I was gone.

As someone mentioned, once you have raiders dependent on call-outs it is hard to get them to think for themselves and they don’t actually learn to deal with mechanics - they just learn to mindlessly do what the RL says. It is slower going at first to expect raiders, especially newer ones, to learn to deal with mechanics on their own, but by doing that you teach them to actually deal with the mechanic. This in turn means that the next time they encounter it (e.g., don’t stand in fire) they’ll be able to deal with it without you having to say a word. Ultimately I think as RL you want to be able to just focus on the new aspects of any fight, not the recycled mechanics from prior bosses. So I think deciding how much to hand hold and how much to call requires you to think about what will increase the skill level of your players - potatoes will stay potatoes as long as you let them and expect them to be. Sometimes you have to have a painful night where the whole raid suffers because of individual failures, but my experience is that (most) players will eventually rise to the occasion if expected to.

I went to watch a Boston Pops holiday concert once and the conductor literally counted the orchestra in and then walked off stage to socialize with the front rower guests while the orchestra kept playing - his leadership was unnecessary beyond that. I think that’s what we should strive to be as RLs, to have developed a raid team over the course of the expansion that no longer needs a RL for 90% of the time.",1590969700

Europe was a slaughterhouse during the middle-ages (called dark ages for a reason) and before nation states, so much that it makes the 20th century world wars look casual, and the concept of borders has brought us an unprecedented era of peace because we've learned to respect those arbitrary lines. No European would see the shape of i.e. Italy and say ""hmm that bit shouldn't be Italy"", and that's a goddamn achievement given human nature. 

So in my opinion as someone from a country that its borders are being disputed by -you know you-, i find Europe to be already pretty damn amazing and i envy those with decent neighbours, i have no idea why some aren't happy with it and feels like setting ourselves for a ""you don't know what you got till it's gone"" moment.

If 10 cops are criminals, and not one cop out of the next 10,000 comes forward to report them, you just end up with 10,010 criminals.

All cops, except for a very extreme minority, who basically need to sacrifice their jobs to do the right thing, are criminals who protect other criminals. There's a reason civilians get charged with accessory when they know a crime has been committed and don't come forward. Shame cops don't get punished for breaking the law.

Joe Rogan mentioned something recently in a podcast with Kevin Hart that you have to balance discipline with enjoyment. If you lean too heavy into cutting yourself off from what gratifies you, you end up obsessing over what you don't have - gratification. If you lean too heavy into fulfilling your desires and cravings immediately, you obsess over indulgence, and then it becomes *over* indulgence. 

Zen can best be described as this: live your life. I'm not a student of Zen though, so take that with a grain of salt, but the way is discovered by going your way. 

All of that to say, it's probably more difficult to see that you're already enlightened if you obsess over not having had sex yet. At twenty, you're right on the cusp of beginning to explore what's available to you. That's beautiful.

"AustralianPolitics","t5_2snwr","That's a bit of a stretch in my opinion mostly because it's an over simplification and it blurs a couple of things that were already happening into one neat package.

 CCP has virus lab

True.

CCP need to quell an uprising in Hong Kong that  threatens hegemony

True.

CCP release virus

A bit vague. Sure it could be have released by deliberate means or even by accidental or mismanagement of control measures. However, the strain they were researching isn't the one we're seeing. And most of the US cases came from a strain from the EU.

and go into lockdown prompting  other countries to follow suit, CCP uses the chaos to pass anti-sedition  laws in Hong Kong

The anti-sedition laws are likely because they couldn't get the extradition laws passed towards the end of last years. The anti-sedition laws are at a constitutional level which effectively over-rides the legislative role. They couldn't get it their (CCP) way, so they tried a different method.

effectively ending the uprising for good protecting  the hegemony.

True.

I offer an alternative theory.

The virus was created by big technology companies  to boost their profits so they could sell more products for people working from home.

Alternative

It was big pharma, to get more money out of the government for 'R&amp;D' into vaccines.

Another.

It was the Green groups trying to plummet CO2 levels.

&amp;#x200B;

There are probably hundreds if not thousands? But I don't believe any of them have a true answer. I think the most sane at the moment is that it was it horseshoe bat, it made it's may to humans via an intermediary host (likely Pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 infections found in Pangolins. shared 91% of their genetic sequence to the ones in humans) to humans and it spread from there. 

We saw similar transmission in MERS.

He was stealing with counterfeit money. Initial reports say he was choked to death, he has high blood pressure and clogged arteries. The cop shouldn’t have had his knee on his neck for 8 mins, especially when he stopped responding. They should be charged. The cops wife divorced him and he was fired.

Also a male and female plug, for connecting the device between the outlet and machine.

As to ""thinking about her"", of course I have. Why would you presume I haven't? They were friends with an ex while we were dating, so I know she has the empathy and communication skills that it shouldn't be a problem in future, and I'm not so full of myself that I'd presume myself better capable and deserving of making life choices of another person.

Ethnic and cultural tension. 

&gt;Australia, 

Ethnic and cultural tension. 

&gt;the United Kingdom, 

Ethnic and cultural tension. 

&gt;Chad,

Ethnic and cultural tension. 

They had a civil war in 2005 between muslims and christians. 

&gt; Togo,

I don't know anything about Togo, unfortunately. 

&gt; etc are all highly multicultural and successful. 

I didn't say a country cannot be successful while simultaneously being multicultural. 

I said multiculturalism leads to conflict. 

&gt;The United States is bizarrely in your list

Black are incarcerated at higher rates, whites are victims of violence at higher rates, etc. 

You are blind if you cannot see the conflict USA is in because of multiculturalism. 

&gt; as a country with conflict comparable to that of Israel/Palestine (of all places). 

I merely listed places with conflict due to ethnicity and culture. 

&gt;What metric are you using to measure 'conflict' because by any metric, the USA is one of the safest places to live in the world.

That has very little to do with the point. For all you know, USA might be a lot more safe with a relative mono culture. 

&gt;Places like Japan where they are 99% homogeneous and incapable of functioning as a society anymore. Their economy is stagnant, their social cohesion is collapsing, and mental health is taking a nosedive. 

You are contributing this the lack of multicultural? While at the same time not mentioning that Japan is one the safest places in the world and the worlds 3rds largest economy. 

&gt;Or China, which is 96.1% made up of Han Chinese.

And they are keeping over a millions muslims in concentration camps, and suppressing Tibet and Hong Kong. 

&gt; It's frankly weird that you put China as an example of a ""multicultural society"" with conflict while somehow missing the fact that it's one of the world's most obvious monoethnic countries.

And their conflicts is due to different ethnicieties and cultures creating tension. 

&gt;Immigrants in UK are forming rape gangs, there seem to be enclaves neigherhoods in Sweden and France that are hostile towards the natives. And pretty much every nation in Europe dislikes muslims.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is propaganda.

You cannot simply call it propaganda. 

The rape gangs in UK where organised pakistani muslim gangs that targeted non-muslim white British girls. This is a direct result because the immigration policies that brought in differing cultures and ethnicities. 

Sweden sexual assaults increased by over 1000% (yes, you read that right) the last 30 years, and this is a direct results of their immigration policies. 

France have entire cities that is overrun by muslims. They have regular riots. 

[https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/news/europe-eu-citizens-want-to-stop-immigration-from-muslim-countries](https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/news/europe-eu-citizens-want-to-stop-immigration-from-muslim-countries)

""On average, 55% of Europeans agree with the statement that all  immigration from Muslim countries should be stopped. 20% of respondents  disagree while 25% of them agree nor disagree ""

&gt;Data and science, you know, those things you are supposed to derive conclusions from, show that diversity is good for society. It exposes us to other viewpoints to compare and contrast with our own, thereby expanding our knowledge and opening up avenues to being more innovative, productive, educated, etc than we otherwise would have been. 

There is still traveling, internet and studying abroad. 

When large nations within the same territory compete, you will have conflict and violence. 

&gt;When a room full of identical people are faced with a problem, they come up with identical solutions. If the single solution they come up with is wrong, they will never solve their problem. 

There is a difference between diversity of mind and ideas, and multicultarism in this context where different nation live among eachother

&gt;A room full of diverse people will come up with diverse solutions. Even if 9/10 of their solutions are wrong, that 1/10 being right still makes them more successful than the room full of identical people.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why do you think a free market is more efficient than a state run market? It has diversity and competition. We also know that diversity in business and research is correlated with economic success and innovation. Research by Sylvia Ann Hewlett , Melinda Marshall and Laura Sherbin for the Harvard Business Review found that: ""A team with a member who shares a client’s ethnicity is 152% likelier than another team to understand that client."" Also, that ""Employees at \[highly diverse\] companies are 45% likelier to report that their firm’s market share grew over the previous year and 70% likelier to report that the firm captured a new market.""

 

Yes, I know of these studies.

I am ofc not doubting that there is *zero* benefits of multiculturalism, that would be ridicules. Even systems like communism and nazism have *certain* benefits.

I am saying diversity+proximity=violent conflict. And I don't think the economic benefits are worth it, because it's obviously possible to still be productive in a mono-cultural society.",1590969705

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","If Batman can work out that Kira is the user and defeating him will stop the stand, he might be able to take it. Sheer Heart Attack isn't a particularly fast stand ability, it's strengths are that it's tenacious and nearly unbreakable. Batman needs to realize that attacking or stopping it is a waste of his time and he needs to go after Kira, and stay out of the range of Killer Queen (assuming he can use KQ for this fight). 

The issue is, while Batman might start out with ranged attacks on Kira (batarangs or gas), he would likely eventually close in for a choke-hold or bone break, and KQ would blow him up. And even if he does manage to evade Queen, Batman doesn't kill, and Kira isn't going to stop using his stand unless he's dead.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Violence, by itself, does not cause policy change. But, to assume that peaceful protests and asking oppressors to please stop has ever actually accomplished change is naive.

The changes that came from the Civil Rights Movement were fueled by a reaction to the oppressive power of the state, not because of asking nicely.",1590969706

Do you have options to see a therapist?

And honestly, if you’re 13 and maybe the Scouts BSA program isn’t for you, you might want to look into Sea Scouting (you mentioned you like knots) or a Venture Crew with a Shooting sports focus. Can join either of those at 14.

"C_S_T","t5_37lis","Correct. A Constitutional convention would almost certainly reduce individual liberty; and make people more dependent on government for income, health care, safety, information, and education; and help people to more easily use government against their friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers.

An honest good-faith interpretation of the Constitution will never be allowed of course, and [a revolution is no longer viable like it was in 1776](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/american-revolution-1776-coming-war-asymmetric-nwo/).

We will have to be more strategic.

The solution is at the individual level.

[If a critical mass become the best version of themselves](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/), then the puppet masters who control the global mainstream (e.g. the US government) would fail increasingly more often in their manipulations, which is why they try so hard to turn us into the worst version of ourselves.

The real battlefield is inside each of us.

This solution is sufficient, but here are two other solutions, which are also at the individual level, but we still need a critical mass to become the best version of themselves to achieve the kind of world we want to live in, so let's just do that.

The second solution is [zero squads](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/american-revolution-status-psyop-pawn-kills-king/).

The third solution is for an Israeli man to commit the greatest act of love  in our lifetimes and walk back to Europe while very publicly calling out his fellow Israelis to join him and explaining why it is the right thing to do. I don't think it will be possible to put the toothpaste back in the tube after that. The world would be sent down an unstoppable path of healing.",1590969708

We switched to curbside service - no clients in the building. Just Pets and coworkers. Ah, the DREAM. We can do our jobs without clients walking around and causing havoc and demanding one-on-one time that takes away from our patients. Clients get to stay in their cars and listen to music and charge their phones and go home sometimes while we treat. 
Not having clients use our medical care plans as an a-la-carte menu because they can nitpick the line items (does my dog HAVE to be hospitalized to get IV fluids?  I mean, can’t you just NOT keep him here but still keep him here?  And does he NEED this feeding tube?  Can’t you just force feed him?) is amazing. However, the number of “while he’s being triaged can you be sure to trim his nails and express his anal glands?” Has increased.  Sir, your dog is dying. If he lives, we can discuss wellness issues like nail trims.....

The traffic to and from work had been BLISSFUL. Now, it’s back to hellish and you can tell people haven’t driven in months. They need remedial help. 

And we’ve been slammed. My ER went 24/7 to reduce transferring patients between us and their GP vet. I’ve had to hire a LOT of people (contract and permanent) and nobody is being totally trained on policies and procedures yet because we are so busy it’s unreal. Everyone has overtime. I’m having to rely on my existing staff to train newbies and it’s stressful all around. But my staff is handling it like a boss and I’m proud of them for stepping up.

My comment, as I said, was as a general stance in response to yours. I said this because in your comment you were saying that their hours can't be compared because of the stress of a medical job but all the things you listed are just things that are par for the course for any ER worker, not things which are specific to these COVID times. So the only logical conclusion of that is you implying that anyone who gets involved with someone in medicine should give up their free time to overcompensate and do a good majority of the housework by default. This is what I take issue with, I can only infer from your comment that you think anyone who gets involved with a doctor should be expected to become at least a partial homemaker and I kind of find that to be bullshit. If you can't handle the stress of being a doctor alone so you expect that your partner should give up their time to support you then that should be explicitly said, not something which is just expected.",1590969709

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Honestly it's my theory that it's harder to make friends, let alone best friends, as we get older. I had a few best friends growing up but we moved apart. I asked myself the same question and I came up with another reason that I'm more picky and discerning with whom I spend my time. Don't know if anyone else feels the same way. When I was a kid, it was easier to have everything in common with a person for some reason. It's kinda sad really. But I do know that I met my last two closest friends through taking a hula hooping class. Theres lots of cool, chill hippie people who do it who are loving and accepting of any and all people. They are also a group of people who are typically more anxious, ADHD, than most people. I'd recommend taking a hula hooping class or other acro yoga type meet up. It will only be awkward the first time but afterwards you will feel good because for one you are exercising (dopamine) and you are focusing on doing something trying to get a trick down while everyone else is focusing on their own thing so it's less self conscious. Seriously I've met the coolest people taking new classes. That is if that sort of thing interests you. There's also a really good book I read if it seems up your alley called Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on it (cheesy ass title I know but it's helped so many people) oh and final tip, once this whole corona thing is over go to a laughter yoga class. Guaranteed funny shit.. Weird but fun. You might find some cool people. I don't know if this will help you but I just thought I'd share a few thoughts.",1590969710

The NIV translation was first quoted by 'AnOddFad', then 'brojangles' told them to ""*keep reading*"" past the original quote because it doesn't say ""*them*"", it says ""*him*"". At that point I joined the conversation and continued to quote from the NIV translation, pointing out that it does say what 'AnOddFad' claimed.

"GlobalOffensiveTrade","t5_2y6r4","We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","I can understand your feelings, and I'm sorry that you were told that you were barely on the spectrum in a way that invalidated your struggles. I wish people could treat the autism spectrum the way many experts approach the severity scale of a condition called endometriosis. I'll explain it and maybe you'll get what I'm trying to say.

With endometriosis, experts use stages to classify it by severity (stage 1 to 4), but the stage doesn't always correspond to a woman's pain and discomfort levels. Meaning a woman could have stage 4 (severe) of the condition (deep, widespread adhesions) but feel nothing. Or she could have stage 1, which is considered minimal. But that doesn’t mean that her pain is minimal or that the effect on her life has been minimal. It just means, from the staging system doctors set up so they could compare patients' conditions before and after treatment, someone technically ranks ""worse"" in terms of the amount or extent of the actual endometriosis lesions.

But the actual effects of those lesions varies from patient to patient widely.  Someone someone with minimal to mild endometriosis can have more pain than someone with severe endometriosis. Alternately, a woman with Stage 1 endometriosis might be more infertile than a woman with Stage 4 endometriosis.

It's a similar idea with trying to 'scale' autism. Someone who is ""deep"" on the spectrum could find that they experience little disruption in their life. Maybe they get diagnosed at a very young age, get a lot of family and community support, not to mention early intervention to help them with their communication and social skills, and get the space to be themselves. They even get to go to a special school for gifted students that allows them to indulge their special interests. That's really great for them. But then there's someone who is technically ""barely"" on the spectrum but gets diagnosed later in life, and part of the reason they didn't test ""deeper"" on the spectrum is due to their later diagnosis and having to struggle and develop their own coping mechanisms. Being on the spectrum has impacted their life in many ways, and in many areas of their life they have had to struggle much harder than the aforementioned person who received an early diagnosis.

You have every right to claim being on the spectrum and nothing about that invalidates other people who have different experiences. If anything, voices like yours are very important, so that people understand that there is no one way to be on the spectrum, autism presents in a variety of packages.",1590969713

have a vaccine ready, which means no one has to go through the trial by illness. Vaccines could come as early as December. Millions of lives are at stake, even if the curve is flat enough under hospital carrying capacity to provide good treatment, if one were to extend this out over that natural course (a few years?).

On the topic of you being a transhumanist, I still most people here, even when they ask and wish for an afterlife, I still think they would live and maximize their lives even with the knowledge of an afterlife. This life has much to offer and just because there is a next stage does not mean most people would just skip this stage completely. As for extending life through technology too, I want that as well, but do realize if there is truly no afterlife, we will all be dead. Simply put we humans, no matter how advanced our technology becomes, can we avoid death due to the collapse of the universe, which is also another scientific theory.

From:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_in_Ohio

“The following is a list of lakes in Ohio. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, there are approximately 50,000 lakes and small ponds in the U.S. state of Ohio, with a total surface area of about 200,000 acres (81,000 ha). About 2,200 of these lakes are 5 acres (2.0 ha) or greater”


Ohio is squarely on the “less than 250 lakes” camp.

"trump","t5_2r18q","Thank you for clarifying, I will respond to each point individually. 

- Protestors are seeking change, looters are using the protests as an excuse and being selfish.

- Peaceful protest is gathering together and being nonviolent. This includes yelling at police and standing in public places. It becomes a riot when it turns physical, no matter who started it. Rioters, however, are only those who engage in the violence. If someone is at a protest, stays when it becomes violent, but doesn’t partake, they are not a rioter.

- Justice is authority being held to the same standards as civilians and being held responsible no matter what when they commit an act against the public, be it false arrests, planting evidence, police brutality, etc. Thuggery is more difficult to describe in this case, since I don’t really ever use the word in my daily life, however if I had to explain, it would be the act of being unnecessarily violent toward an innocent person/party. For example, those who choose to blatantly exploit the protests are thugs, but that doesn’t mean every person at the protest is a thug. In fact, a vast majority are not. It is the select few.

- Please explain the term “virgin card”, as I don’t see how that’s relevant to the conversation. I would also point out that it is untrue, unless you’re referring to my zodiac sign.",1590969716

Why aren't they calling smokers, or alcoholics, or overweight people selfish? They are doing things which have an obvious negative impact on their health. These behaviours significantly increase their chances of catching the virus, suffering a more serious case of it and dying from it. Because of this, the rest of us have to stay locked down for longer because the virus is deemed to be a bigger threat than it otherwise would be. 


Facebook is littered with posts showing people relaxing at home with a glass of wine and big boxes of greasy takeaway dinners...why aren't they called selfish for making unhealthy choices? In fact, it's the opposite - these behaviours are glorified! Why are we suddenly encouraging people to engage in unhealthy activities? A trip out to the grog shop or fast food outlet is deemed essential, yet going out for a haircut or to the park is deemed selfish. 


Now to be clear, I don't think we should start going around calling people selfish. If they want to drink themselves into an early grave, that's their own problem and none of my business. So why should they get to call me selfish for wanting to return to normal life? Alcohol is obviously important to these people and they'd be complaining in an instant if they were prevented from having it. Yet when I am prevented from doing things I care about, I'm not allowed to complain?",1590969716

Some of this boils down to using known techniques in smarter or more user-friendly ways. Some of it’s about finding technical workarounds. Some boils down to engaging with the platforms themselves.

You have to ways it will end up working though.  Either they put in the milestone rewards for beyond what we can achieve currently meaning it's still time gated to content releases.  Or they only let us see rewards up to current achievable max. In which case when new content hits we would also get the reveal of what can be selected.  Either way the rewards would be done.

Of the rest, being a lawyer will benefit you, but you'll have staff that can assist you with understanding the law. Being a lawyer will not help you get elected, and may even hurt you, considering how disliked lawyers generally are. There are many ways to get into politics prior to running for office, like joining campaigns or working as staff for politicians. Those are worth exploring, if you're committed to politics.

You should also consider what kind of law you'd like to get involved in. ""Constitutional law"" is extremely broad, and covers everything from federal diversity litigation to free speech.

I am not opposed to violence, and I believe it has its place. However I think that in our current political system, if we truly want change, then we either do this peacefully 100% or we commit to a full on violent overthrow of the government. I for one am not ready to take such a drastic measure though. I think there is still a chance that we can correct our government and political system peacefully, using established processes and procedures in line with our constitution. I only say there’s a chance though because I think it’s just as possible that the corruption cheats it’s way to winning. Once we’ve exhausted all our options, then the time for violence is at hand. Once our constitutional freedoms and ability to vote for legislation are taken away, then that is when we need to rise up. I‘m afraid to say I believe that we’re almost there, but we have to stay committed to what America is supposed to be and honestly try and resolve this peacefully first.",1590969718
"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","This is biased and intentionally leaves out very important facts.

&gt;The study, produced jointly by the Center for Food Safety and the Save Our Seeds campaigning groups

To just to start, this is a non-peer reviewed study funded by two anti-GMO lobbying groups.

&gt;However, one of those suits, against Indiana soybean farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman, is a potentially landmark patent case that could have wide implications for genetic engineering and who controls patents on living organisms.

This is one of those cases where they've intentionally left out the most important information, the facts that caused the courts to rule in favor of Monsanto.  Bowman didn't save seeds, he bought seeds from a local grain elevator.  That would have been fine on its own.  *But*, afterwards, he sprayed the purchased seeds with Roundup to specifically isolate the Monsanto-developed seeds with their patented herbicide-resistant trait.  He then could use roundup to rid his fields of weeds without licensing any seeds from Monsanto.  This is piracy!  If he had just purchased the seeds and grown them, that would have been fine.  But he went after the protected trait (herbicide resistance) without paying to license it.

So, my original statement holds up:   In my experience, most arguments people have against GMOs base on IP result from a fundamental misunderstanding of those protections, or biased/propagandized versions of case law, usually due to some documentaries skewing the facts.",1590969718

Whereas Melia is easily the best for chain attacks, because her talent art gets used as a regular attack. Thus can be used to follow up anything and lead into anything. Also (when controlled by the player) Melia’s damage output is one of the highest you can get. As for Dunban he’s a agility tank so he (when equipped properly) will rarely get hit. Also other characters do get healing arts, like Shulk’s light heal but better. And Reyn and Dunban have some really good auras that can stop you dying.

There will be no united citizen militia against the totalitarian police force marching through the streets. People will riot until they are fired upon and then run and hide for safety. 

You think the police, national guard, and all these insane psychos are bad now? Just wait until they have an excuse to open live fire rounds into a crowd of people. Hundreds of innocent people will die, a few police *might* and then the entire country will burn, not just 2 or 3 cities.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","&gt;if your main takeaways entail categorising the characters and their actions in self-contained vacuums of right-doings and wrong-doings, then you have failed to comprehend the message that spike lee is trying to convey through such a social drama.

This doesn't make any sense to me. How am I not understanding the message if I'm trying to make moral sense of the events? If this is indeed Spike Lee's central message then it's not a message anybody should find interesting; it's destructive and myopic to the point of banality. 

&gt;the point that mr. spike lee is trying to make is that one can't equate looting and rioting to the unnecessary and cruel murder of a black man

&gt;we seem to be more horrified by the actions of rioting and looting, as compared to murder

Nobody is trying to equate the two! It is a GIVEN, as in universally accepted, that the deaths of Radio Raheem and George Floyd are not justified...it's a moral issue that is already solved, and further disputes on whether or not the riots are right are attempts to self-reflect and contain the damage, so that further unnecessary violence is avoided. As you're presenting it the message appears to be something like ""things happen and stuff"" which is incredibly trite, the message should be what we learn from the incident and how we can de-escalate and prevent such a tragedy in the future. 

Spike Lee is implying that you shouldn't question the morality of actions that follow an atrocity...how can future atrocities be prevented if we do not somewhere along the line halt the vicious cycle? Questioning whether or not the right thing was done in the end is the only reasonable line of thinking, not a SINGLE person is going ""hey they burned that pizza place down that's so much worse than Raheem dying"". Because the alternative is what we have now, people taking to the streets, too dumb to think beyond the next store they're looting, their next fit of pointless rage. We have local businesses getting torched and innocent people losing their lives. People are burning down their own cities for what? 

Sadly, judging by your responses and these downvotes, I can see that endorsement of the rioting is the politically hot thing among Redditors right now. I think your wishy-washy equivocating is bullshit. We absolutely should take moral stances on things that are relevant now, not wring our hands over past atrocities and rationalize away [current ones](https://twitter.com/brandondarby/status/1266931208275013633) like you're doing.",1590969719

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Cradle is a western-style ""cultivation"" novel, which is based on Chinese fantasy themes. Magic is closely intertwined with martial arts practice. 

Characters in these novels will generally have some big goal, like saving the world, or living forever, or revenge, etc. They will come across some martial arts techniques that they will cultivate. In Cradle cultivation is called ""cycling"" and it is basically meditation in which characters draw in the magical natural energy of the world to improve their spirits and physical bodies and use to cast spells. They also tend to specialize into swords, fire, lightning, earth, or wind type magic and their progression is also gaining insight into the Platonic truth of the sword, for example.

Along the way, characters will generally progress through different stages. Advancing stages in most novels (but not all) brings an increased lifespan, and by the end of the novel/series the main character has often ascended to a God-like rank with functional immortality. So in Cradle when one becomes a ""Sacred Artist"", they progress through the ranks of Foundation, Copper, Iron, Jade, Gold, and so on. Each rank or ""realm"" comes with new abilities like the ability to see magic, or a vastly more powerful body, or a special ability based on what sort of path they are cultivating. A wind-style Sacred Artist might develop wings at one stage, for example.

There's a whole subgenre of these kind of books you can find at /r/ProgressionFantasy for more Western novels or /r/noveltranslations for translated novels from China and elsewhere. Western written novels tend to downplay the Daoist and Buddhist elements, use Western-style names, and not focus as much on Eastern cultural elements like face or filial piety.",1590969719

They respond first and foremost with the intent to protect and serve and in turn we as a society hold them in higher personal esteem. Everyone’s safer and more protected, the cops still get their lifetime pensions and the added bonus of being legitimate civic heroes for their service. 

Finding a way to put an end to the “us vs them” mentality these precincts vomit out to their officers, is one of the keys. 

We’re seeing some examples of officers standing alongside protestors, like we started to see during the turning of the civil rights movement.

I really wish the devs would implement crosshair coloring/opacity setting in the game.

I've heard generally whether you've given birth (or have had sex) doesn't really affect what size cup you need because the vaginal canal returns to the same size after birth. However, it does have to do with cervix height for the most part. Since you said you think you have a high cervix you might keep experimenting because it may be the shape of the cup. I remember whenever I started using tampons when I was 13 or 14 it took me a while to find a brand that didn't make me cramp and I found it was the shape of the tampons so maybe its the same concept with the two cups you've tried",1590969721

The difference between faith and science is that Faith doesn’t hide behind the superiority of having “proof”. All you guys care about is proof but how can you be so sure that your proof was acquired accurately and that you are interpreting it correctly?

The last couple years I have adored **Tom Delonge’s** style. He is a deceptively innovative and creative player. 

**John, Paul**, and **George** equally. Just amazing in their own ways. John Lennon particularly I just love his grit. Get Back is my favorite example of that. Dude may never have felt like he was a great player but god damn he was. 

**Bruce Springsteen.** underrated as a guitarist. His solos are so sick man. He is a gunslinger all over Darkness on the Edge of Town and Born in the USA.

The irony behind this though, is that he himself is contributor to injustice (in china, bahrain etc.) while shaming people that aren't spreading activism on a problem that affects him. 

But I can't see any reasonable excuse for shaming Sebastian Vettel for example for not using his platform to raise awareness. If people want to be unbothered with their family in privacy, they shouldn't be shamed for it.

&gt; Well I bought a bottle of Glendronach 15 year old for a few bucks more than this blend goes for. It's 46%, NCF, and I'd imagine far more interesting. The 12 year old can be found for $49 here, as can Glenfarclas 12. Both of these are natural color though I think the GF is chill-filtered? Not sure.

GD15 is $105 vs Story of the Spaniard is $60 so hard to make a comparison there. 

&gt; Anyway, the blend may be more upfront and honest about what it is, but that doesn't equate to it being better. Just looking at the notes from this review, I can pretty confidently say I like all those single malts better than I'd probably ever enjoy this blend.

I like story of the Spaniard more than mac12 sherry. Point of my original post was don’t automatically think something is gonna be better just bc it’s a blend. If you ever get a chance I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. 

Ordered my first gd and gf over the weekend. 105 &amp; cask strength as opposed to 12 though. Excited to see if either can stand next to Abunadh.",1590969728

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","My workplace mostly deals with the integration of COTS hardware and software to engineer a total system that meets requirements. The systems then stay in service for 15 years or so.

Whilst everything is theoretically COTS, there are odd cases where a particular project decided to custom build a single card for a particular function or buy an embedded industrial Linux PC and program it as a complex custom protocol converter. The reasons for these decision are lost to antiquity. 

The people who designed and programmed these things were given the task because they were thought to be really good at it. But they weren't professional programmers or working in a company that normally did that level of programming. Inevitably, those people left over time, leaving zero documentation about how these things worked. In some cases, they didn't tell anyone where the source code was even saved.

These devices work flawlessly, until you need a change to the system for whatever reason. Then you're up the creek without a paddle.

My biggest gripe about programming is projects knowingly creating a maintainability nightmare to save a few bucks up front. The savings get wiped out down the line when you end up having to replace an entire system because you can't make a minor modification.",1590969730

As far as the LoB applications, this is where the PaaS solutions the clouds offer come into play. If you have an app that depends on MSSQL, you move the database to the managed service and connect to it through a VM.

And also, doesn't the ST say the same thing? The only difference is, is that same authoritarian empire has reemerged, taken back power and ""rebranded"" so to speak as the First Order. 

It's still essentially the story of the little, oppressed people or group against the big bad government in power. But the cool dynamic there is we actually see them regain that power in episode 7.

But I like the ST because its (not seen in the movies. Only in books/comics) the Resistance coming into existence knowing the threat that the New Republic refused to acknowledge. Leia tried to warn them. That's an interesting dynamic to me.

I think we will get to see that more in future live-action &amp; animated projects. Just as we saw with Clone Wars &amp; Rebels, that will flesh out the post ROTJ era that leads into the ST.

It is possible that they could be wrong, but it is more likely that they are correct. When they talk about a million things, they are going to be right most of the times. It is logical &amp; academic to expect them (authoritative sources) to be correct. More likely to be true.",1590969733

I don't really know anything about all the ""bootcamps"" people rave about, but I can promise you there is enough free content on youtube for you to get a good start  :)  


JavaScript and Php are a whole different type of programming than HTML/CSS. HTML and CSS are as you know the content and styling of web pages, but JavaScript and plenty of other languages are the controllers and all the logic of how they work/what they do. The one nice thing is once you understand the basic concepts of these logic languages, it's a bit easier to learn the other ones (well, some).

&amp;#x200B;

So if you aren't getting JS/PHP right away, maybe try Python. It's generally a bit easier for beginners to learn due to it's structure and syntax. Once you've learned the basics of loops,functions, classes, variables, etc. in Python, you can go back to JS. While they may look different and work slightly different, loops/functions/classes/variables do the same sort of stuff in any language.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck!",1590969734
"thewallstreet","t5_3jstw","**Valuation:**

According to FactSet, the blended Q1 earnings decline is -14.6% vs -6.9% on March 31. The consensus earnings growth estimate for Q2 is -43.1%. For FY2020, it is -21.1%. For FY2021, however, it is +28.2%.

Spoos has risen as much as 40% since its March 23 low and is currently down just 5.9% for the year. What's happened in the market since March 23, then, has nothing to do with today and everything to do with tomorrow.


Spoos is trading at 21.8x forward twelve-month earnings. That's roughly as high as it has been since the dot-com boom era, as some pundits have pointed out. Still, pundits have suggested it's not as rich as it seems when accounting for (a) the low interest rates and (b) the likelihood that estimates will be going up as the economic reopening picks up steam.",1590969735

My sister has a rat, which has a cage that needs to be cleaned regularly. Today, my sister deciding to clean the cage, which requires her to put the rat into a smaller cage. The small cage has a hole in the top for a water bottle, and my sister didn’t realize that the water bottle was still on the counter (recently been washed). She put the rat in, and it escaped from the hole. She hurries and looks for the water bottle while my mom starts to yell at her. 
Mom- “It’s on the counter!”
Sister- “Ok.” (Quietly, afraid to anger her). 
My brother grabs the bottle and hands it to my sister.
M- “See!? Right where I said it was!” 
Now, I was playing on my PC and thought that it was done and over with. The water bottle was in place, the rat was safe. My mom then yells at me “Can you please help them?!”
Me- “Okay. But why do you have to yell?”
Mom- “Oh sorry, it’s my fault.” Then she unpauses her show and continues to watch.
Me- “It’s not your fault, I just don’t understand why you have to yell.”
The she watches her show for a few minutes before stomping to her room and slamming the door. Did I do something wrong? I just didn’t think she needed to yell at my sister or me.

If you truly did (or do) care at all about Covid or social distancing, why are you all now doing the EXACT OPPOSITE of what you were preaching for just a few days ago? ""The virus doesn't care about your rights"" was a typical slogan people threw around here for the last 3 months. Is everyone finally ready to admit that Covid was overhyped?

** Full Disclaimer ** This was written last night while double fisting rum and coke and IPAs

It’s official, It’s 2020 and your teams area all officially shit.

Amidst the Crovid-19 Pandemic and sports being shut down across the world we are all practicing social distancing, but we still have Fantasy Sports and it is time for my yearly bashing of everybody. Boys, 2020 is here and it is not off to the start that I had imagined. What a landslide of shitty events; first, Etienne and Chubba Hubbard don’t declare for the draft and go back to school now Corona is fucking with the entire 2020 draft completely. With all the build-up of Vegas and having booked our flight and hotel, I was just starting to set up my player interviews and individual work outs with my draft prospects. Now, it’s all coming crashing down. La Faucs has always been a survivor though, nothing will change, The league of Scrubs will be mine. In the words of Drake “I started at the bottom and now I’m here”. The world is working against me but 2020 is my year and I will not be denied,  I will persist and come out of this stronger than ever. I have spent the last week in isolation logging in to mmfl.com and trying to propose trades to the league but I just can’t pull the trigger as the stench is too strong. Can’t trade gold for shit, just can’t do it. All I know is when this pandemic gets more out of control, I will sleep well at night knowing the Faucs house hold is stocked with the finest of cashmere toilet paper and your team is shit.

Lets start right here.. 


Baguars Your team is like an outhouse shit

“Urban Faucsanary: Just unbearable to use but you do anyways. Every year you think about installing something new but you go with the same structure. You just run out there every week, hold your breath, and do what you gotta do to get through another shitty week. It’s time to invest in change. Build it up and enjoy a new luxury or forever hold your breath.

This QB thing is just gross. Carr and Haskins both might get replaced in the draft and if they do, you got to burn it down. Even if they don’t why roll out with this? I guess Tyrod is a starter in LA, nah they are drafting a QB for sure. And no, Nick Mullens ain’t going to New England to be the savior. Man, the draft is probably gonna cripple Ronald Jones into oblivion too. A-aron doesn’t give a fuck though, he’s got Jarwin boys and Theien is on pace for 200 catches.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","They do develope musculature to deal with the additional weight. However the mechanics of cholesterol storage and fat in the body become problematic over a certain threshold. When the levels become too high to immediately process, additional storage must be created.

Cholesterol is an essential building block of all our cells, hormones and comprises a large portion of the makeup of adipose tissue. LDL brings cholesterol to the cells, when and where needed for repair and development. When there is an increase of LDL in circulation it is supposed that the bodys natural defenses are hyper inundated and cholesterol is found to be stored within the damaged tissue and white cells. The problem here is the constant damage the body's heart and vascular tissue is routinely undergoing through use, combined with the blood filled with excess LDL in transport. The daily remodeling to the tissue is layered with excess cholesterol during this process. That cholesterol imbedded creates further inflammation and a rigidity that limits blood flow. The sticky, dense walls are now prone to plaque development, further reducing blood flow. All this slows down oxygenation to the tissues and increases strain on the heart, which can decrease or stagnate muscle development.

The propagation of additional adipose tissue through the body makes organ function more difficult, and will require additional nutrients and blood flow. This, ironically, further depletes the body of oxygen and other nutrients to maintain its additional storage. Further taxing the heart to circulate enough blood to oxygenate the tissue. Less nutrients, less ability to produce healthy musculature.",1590969739

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It’s not my job. It is the prosecutor’s job. The police officer’s job. Even the judge’s job. “Justice” is plenty represented in the criminal justice system, and has all the resources.

If a guilty person walks free, it is because the police screwed up, or the prosecutor screwed up. End of story. There is no magic wand I can wave, to get guilty people out of trouble. When it happens, it happens *entirely* because the government tried to cut corners. Maybe the cops obtained evidence illegally. Maybe the prosecutor brought a thin case to trial. Maybe both. Either way, it isn’t my client that should be punished for that. Demand better from your government, and stop attacking the only people standing against them (in this circumstance).

I get paid the same, whether my clients are innocent, guilty, accused of murder, or accused of blowing a stop sign. They pay nothing. So quit with the mercenary bullshit.

And you wouldn’t just be a bad lawyer. You would get disbarred. Once you’re assigned to a case, you can’t quit because you don’t like the facts. That would defeat the purpose of having a lawyer.

Either you believe everyone deserves a defense, or you don’t. If you don’t, at least be honest and admit it is your own moral flaw. Admit that, in your mind you are somehow smarter, and better positioned than the whole of the criminal justice system, to determine who, and who doesn’t deserve to be defended.

Admit that you don’t believe certain people deserve a defense, based solely on what they are accused of.

And then remember that thousands of innocent people have been exonerated *after being convicted,* and remember that each one of them would still be in prison, or would have been executed, for crimes they did not commit *if it weren’t for defense attorneys.*",1590969741

Advocating violence against people who did no harm is advocating committing a fucking crime against innocent people.

## What Happens Each Round?

The person on **attack** at the start of each round takes the first action. If you start on **defense**, you go second and cannot attack during the round (unless a spell or ability gives you an attack token).

When taking the first action on attack, you can attack with the units  on your back line, play a spell, or summon another unit. To play any  card, you have to drag it from your hand onto the board. Be careful,  though. Once you take an action, your opponent may be able to respond.  **It may be better strategically to attack right away when the round  begins; if you summon a unit while your opponent has no defenders,  they’ll have a chance to summon a unit to block.**

I was given the choice to go voluntarily or I'd be forced which in my state occurs via a law that mental health patients called 402. A law that basically allows them to help you whether you ask for it or not. I didn't have insurance and ended up with a hefty hospital bill that I got lowered to $248 but was over $14k.

Pro-tip: don't crowd the bar, keep back a little (like in the middle), when braing use some body english (not just push on the bars to take your weight, especially if you have the front brake grabbed), reach back to your skateboarding days and move your body as the balance.

That's awesome for them but do you actually want one or do you feel left out so just want to get one? Are there any girls sparking your interest or do you feel like you need one b/c they got one?

If you want a gf though my advice will depend on age

High school age? Best way to meet girls is via school or other friends. Your friend's gfs have friends so start to meet them get to know them. girls talk about guys so the more girls who know you the more likely for one to like you. School clubs are a must it is where I met most of exes.

Under 18: use social media to your advantage Instagram, snap chat, etc are great ways to communicate. get a girls social media and get to know her a lot of introverts are more confident online. the idea tho is to be confident irl too even if you are internally freaking out 

Over 18 or turning 18 soon? Dating  apps is key you can meet plenty of woman and get to know them and find one you connect with before even meeting irl

What kind of grade level is this? I'm assuming high school which again means connections via friends and school are key here",1590969744

1. Buy 12-inch or more fan. 

2. In the evening, point fan OUT of window. 

3. Open another window, preferably on the other side of the house/flat. 

4. Enjoy cooler air being pulled in from outside. Watch the temperature drop. 

5.  In the morning, shut all the windows BEFORE the temperature outside exceeds that of inside. 

6. Repeat in the evening. 


The system creates a wind tunnel effect to remove warm, still air from the day and replace it with cool evening air from outside. 

Note: As logic dictates, this DOES NOT WORK if it’s warmer outside, which is why you shut windows in the mornings on really hot days. 

In previous summers, my flat was always 25c+ in the summer. Last two summers it’s more like 18-20c using this system. Really big difference.

Hope you enjoy the system as much as I do. It’ll save you £500 on a portable AC during June/July.  It will bring in a few more bugs, but for me it’s worth it as I hate the heat.",1590969744

Coconut oil as a temporary alternative to betamethazone might help.   Coconut oil fights inflammation and scarring just like betamethazone but through different mechanisms.

In the first place only one of his slaves was even released when he died, on top of him beating them to test efficiency experiments on his farm and circumventing the law to track down escaped ones that made it to other states. The point I’m making is that you can pick almost literally anyone that we consider great from that era and find deeply problematic behavior and beliefs if you look at them without context. 

After my first comment I saw the petition about it and the petitioner states specifically stated that the statue was placed there to “scare and oppress African-Americans on campus.” And would absolutely support the removal if that were the case, but the reality of the situation is that we have a ton of Jefferson stuff because he was fundamental in the founding of our university.

It's then possible to have a pick from 5gks even if they are the top 5 league gks. 

And in my experience in picks and guaranteed packs so far, it's likely gonna play out how cheesyboi says.

  They’re pretty good, they even toss in some juggling and fire eating.  Then the hat comes out for the collection, and these feisty soul-eaters aren’t exactly asking.

"AdeptusCustodes","t5_axckp","I agree with just about every one of these points. I will say though that lessening our points + increasing everything insanely may not be best. Keeping high points cost is ok if we are noticeably different in our ability. Having superubermega custodies be 25 points would quickly make us the new 9th edition Iron Hands. 

While I don't believe for a minute that Psychic is gonna implement the radical change for us to be top-tier, and who knows how long until the next codex, I do believe that we may get some good things. Most imperium factions have gotten better PA treatment than non-imperium, and while I don't condone the mistreatment of other armies (rip Genestealers), at the very least it remains hopeful that Talons get some goodies. 

We are by no means a low-tier army. We are objectively middle-ranked, if only because of deep striking everything and our heavy armor being decent. While we lack wounds, survivability, CP, movement, and firepower, we simply need a few overhauls to make us decent and fun to play. As players, we should not strive for top-tier, and we must constantly recognize that the ambition for custodes to be viable in the meta is not equivalent to surpassing it. We need help, but we are far from the ones who need it most. Until then, just a few of these changes could very easily make custodes into a fun, competitive, and unique army.

Specifically for melee. We really need to make better use of our gun-spears and oiled golden muscles.",1590969746

That being said there is probably room for compromise. I don't know what you husband's skill level is or how much protection he was wearing when he crashed so, take these suggestions with a grain of salt. 

If he was pushing his skill level by trying that gap jump, maybe you can talk to him him to take it a little easier and build into the big stuff slower. Coming back from a big crash he may end up just doing this naturally as it can take time to mentally get over them.

You might also be able to convince him to wear more protection when attempting large, high risk features. A back protector and neck brace may have mitigated some of the damage he took in the crash.",1590969748

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","It’s on the more difficult side of the classes.

It’s incredibly brainless until you obtain the skill ‘Tsubame-Gaeshi,’ this duplicates the last Iaijutsu you used and is available every minute.

The class wants to strictly loop back around into a Midare &gt; Tsubame every minute. One misplaced GCD and unless you are accustomed to the class you are looking at breaking your rotation and having to create another loop on the fly or delay yourself.

This also means adapting your rotation with your various GCD manipulation tools (Meikyo and more importantly Hagakure) based on mechanics and understanding the amount of downtime you’ll suffer. 

While the class offers a lot of flexibility to adapt to situations and recover...you really need to understand all your options, and interactions.

Now, if you want to just hit big slashy skills and ignore that rotation then yeah, it’s easy. But so is every other class at that point.

The class provides a fair amount of depth and a lot of reward in terms of performance for successfully executing its core rotation.",1590969748

people immediately got giga-butthurt and my comment was downvoted to below visibility and they started arguing that yes, it has to be consensual. my incredulity at this butthurt-ness the only thing keeping me in this conversation, i never really cared about whether the drawing was consensual or not, all i wanted to say was that fleur and hermione were more powerful.",1590969749

Never had a dog that attacked other dogs or people or was anything other than all love and coolness. 

Never had a dog that chews shit or is destroying anything, ever, aside from those precious first few months as a pup.

Always had dogs that are very intelligent, and very ""human"" in the way that they understood how to behave socially in groups without being that ""problem child"" that is trying to get attention through annoying methods...

People always asked what's me and my moms secret (seriously, friends do), and I feel like it's obvious myself, but all I can say is that i do what you all should be. 

I spend lots of time with my dog everyday. I talk to him like a human and dont use baby talk. I feed him good high quality food and give lots of chewie strips (low fat treat that is a time consumer).

And above all else, the hard part but also the most important one, I walk them before and after work for about 15-20 mins each time. Rain, snow, whatever, just do it. You and your dog(s) will forever and always cherish and appreciate it once it becomes way of life.",1590969749

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","It literally never will stop. Racists will always exist. Racists will always end up in power. No matter how many Arby's get burned down. No matter how many people get stomped in the middle of the street.

Incompetence will always exist, where these people have a pattern of this behaviour but wont be fired or punished appropriately or swiftly enough. 

What's needed is appropriate screening for these type of people before they get in positions of power. When this happens, they need to be punished swiftly and not be given leniency. Better training and education is also needed. This will minimize such incidents but it literally cannot ever not exist at all.

What's not needed is to fucking burn shit and attack people in the street like absolute savages. No cop will look at acts of wantom criminality and savagery and decide that less lethal force is warranted for potential criminals. This is the most ass backwards shit I've ever seen.

Who is looking at this and deciding that these types of people will make nice neighbors?

I understand that deca and other 19-nors are frowned upon for those doing PCT as they can interfere with going back to natural production. If immediately after this blast I'm back to 120mg/wk TRT cruise is there still a reason to worry about Deca's lingering metabolites?

My main concern in running this cycle is, if ran 20 weeks starting starting June 1, that will like 8-9 weeks on cruise before annual TRT bloodwork. I may run anavar during the end of the cycle as well, so the 8-9 weeks are to ensure that my test levels are back to 'normal' after switching to cruise for that length of time, and there is a period to get my lipid and liver values back to within range. 

Going off of half life I believe test levels would be back to normal within 4-6 weeks. I've also seen studies that even after harsh orals (100mg dbol per day for 8+ weeks) lipids can bounce back within just 5 weeks. I'll only be running anavar 50mg/day for maybe last 6 weeks, so fairly mild as far as the orals impact on lipids/liver.

Is there anything that I need to be concerned about with the Deca regarding typical TRT bloodwork (Free/Total T, CBC, Liver, Lipids, Thyroid) after suspending only 8 weeks prior to panel? (Assuming endo isn't testing me for deca metabolites)",1590969750

Trevor Noah had a great take on this. We don't loot basically because we have a social contract. (If everyone woke up and decided to be a criminal tomorrow, the police couldn't stop it.)

"LGBTeens","t5_2t8gr","Hello! Your post has been automatically removed because you did not include a minimum of one required tag in the title.

Please keep in mind the title tag must be typed IN THE TITLE of your post and retain their SQUARE brackets as shown below, on Reddit Redesign and old reddit you still must type it into the title, you cannot select your tag anywhere, you must type it!

All posts on the subreddit require at a minimum of one tag surrounded by square brackets in the title to describe what kind of content it is, these are the only current tags you can use and they are case-sensitive &amp; spelling sensitive, so check the spelling and brackets on your title if you continue to get this message.

The allowed tags are as follows: [Non-LGBT] [Crushes] [Article] [Picture] [Video] [Audio] [Rant] [Sexual Health] [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] [Discussion] [Relationships]

If you are still confused on how to use the tag system all you do is pick at least one of the above tags, then place the written tag somewhere in your post title (Do not forget the square brackets surrounding each tag [] ) here are some correct &amp; incorrect titles to help you out.

Example correct title: I found out my crush likes me! [Crushes]
Notice the square brackets and capitalization and correct spelling!

Example correct title: [Coming Out] [Family/Friends] How do I come out?
Notice the spelling/brackets &amp; capitalization is consistent and location of the tags do not matter.

Example incorrect title: I found out my crush likes me! (Crushes)
Notice the parentheses instead of square brackets 

Example incorrect title: Anyone else find Tom Holland stupidly hot? [Dicsussion]
Notice the misspelled Discussion

Once you have a correct title with a tag all you have to do is submit the post and the bot will do the rest for you and now users can sort your content by the tags! If you have any more questions feel free to contact the moderators in ModMail.

"nextfuckinglevel","t5_m0bnr","She did her b/s for a televised experiment in the UK. Dividing the class into blue eyed and non-blue eyed and oppressing the blue eyes. Those that refused to treat the blue eyed poorly were kicked out of the experiment and were apparently racist for trying to sabotage her experiment. Anyone blue eyed person who refused to go along with it was entitled and also kicked out. At the end she said ""yeah the blue eyed people here got treated like black people, think on that"".

So yes, anyone who stands up to her experiment to prove how racist people are is a racist. Can't win either way.

Also at the start she asked for black people to name times they were discriminated against and it took a while before anyone came up with anything. A dude eventually said about how when he first started picking up his white step child from school he'd get funny looks off the other parents. She said that was racism.",1590969751

2)Maybe the wolf guard terminator set. Quite a lot of bits to work with and they are quite good either shooty with combi plasma or SB, full melee with SS and power weapons, or even mixed between melee and shooty.

3)I cant really recomend the easy build agressor because they come with the flamer option only and you really want to run them as bolters but if your group doenst mind ""count as"" i guess they are fine?

Another option: Consider volunteer opportunities that get you out of the service. There is a whole hallway culture at churches of people who are so worn out from their ""serving,"" they don't actually sit in the sermon. This can get tricky depending on the size of your church. As part of band, dance, drama teams, it was pretty straight forward. If your church serves food/beverages, helping set up means you get in early.

"Competitiveoverwatch","t5_34fcy","Genji's only pluses is vertical mobility and Dragonblade being ok, everything sucks. He has barely any damage, is very squishy, 0 self sustain, basically he lacks a neutral. The entire gameplan is Dragonblade because it's the only part of the kit that has value, they need to buff his neutral.

Basically imo:

Shurikens either need more damage or a faster projectile speed, with alt fire getting a lower spread. 

Reloading needs to be slightly faster and he should be able to reload while wall climbing, speaking of wall climbing triple jump wouldn't hurt

Deflect being better.

Dash is fine though they could give it the bleed or even bring back the og burst combo of shuriken&gt;melee&gt;dash but that might be op but the game is vastly different now compared to then.

Now not all of these needs to be done but I think a substantial Shuriken buff, reload buff, and fixing deflect would be a good start to giving him a neutral.",1590969752

&gt;Obama, like Bill Clinton before him, was the product of a Democratic Party that had forgotten its history and legacy. For much of the 20th century, Democrats’ fundamental politics involved fighting against concentrations of economic power in favor of the rights and liberties of ordinary people. “The fight has always been about whether monopolists run our world, or about whether we the people do,” Stoller writes.  
&gt;  
&gt;But in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, as Stoller explains, Democrats altered their economic vision. They abandoned New Deal and Great Society liberalism in favor of a new dogma that came to be known as neoliberalism — a view of society in which markets and financial instruments, rather than government policy and direct intervention, are seen as the best way to achieve social ends.",1590969753

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in LGPE and Sw/Sh:

1. Do not discuss trades over PM or chat. This is prohibited by Rule 4, as scammers often contact other users privately to avoid having their actions seen in public. Please report anyone violating this rule to the moderators. 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny or event Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

I don't think they're justified, because they're BLACK, I think they're justified because the officer's LIFE IS IN DANGER. A lot of the times, I see men and women get hurt because they won't comply, just as much as I see people die for no apparent reason. But you obviously can't read in between the lines and see that; instead your eyes are only drawn to ""black"", ""killing"", ""justified."" And if by white mass murderers, you mean Dylan Roof, well here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPRUBEfIStU) I think you need to watch (though I doubt you will); around 6:45 mark he shows you why they didn't just kill the sick bastard i.e. Dylan Roof.

As for the police violence. Some of the videos, I agree the police have no right to be that aggressive, but for others, I think it's fair warning. If they tell you not to get close, then stop getting close or you will be met with force. That's on them. You can protest on one side of the street, but who in their right mind thinks walking at the police is good idea? It's not, you're asking for it.

As for the breaking windows, if that's actually the cop people are outting him as, then fuck that guy for trying to start shit. I acknowledge the fact that there is scum like that out there.

As for your final thought, no I'm not going to do any of that. I do think that the protestors **who are rioting** are wrong. This is not the way to stand up to the system. You have nothing else to say to me, but I at least hope you read this and take it seriously.",1590969754

Speed difference is not noticeable either way because the bottleneck is not going to be USB, but the HDD.

If you want to use an SSD on the other hand, the SATA can make a difference.

I have an HC1 purely because cable management is a lot easier that way.

So let them release the tape to the public (the show's version of wikileaks, which would make the villains much more interesting), fuel protests against the government, arrest Veidt, and win the election. 

Which would open the possibility of a season 2 with president Keene. And maybe then let Dr Manhattan come back and have people persuade him to intervene. Or something along those lines. Just my 2 cents.",1590969758

I'll be sure to EQ for some extra bass and play with the app. Sony Connect seems really solid. And no matter what, they'll probably sound better than the MPOW H19 IPO I'm returning tomorrow. Sort of off topic but those are like *all bass*. And not the kind you'd want but like the rumble for rumble's sake that messes everything else up. The ANC gave me headaches but I don't know if that will be the same with anything else because that was my first experience with it. The pressure imbalance seems to affect everyone differently. The Sony's seem a lot better, especially in the sound department, for basically the same price

It has never been stated that those in armour cannot use Lightning. And why would a Jedi be worried about not being able to use Force Lightning? If you want an example of a Jedi being in armour and not being limited at all, watch the 2003 Clone Wars. Obi-Wan wears clone armour and is still just as powerful.

Revan moving slowly in KOTOR, again, is a game mechanic. The game is based around slow, combat that is similar in pace to turn based combat.

&gt; As protests sparked by George Floyd&amp;#039;s death entered their chaotic fifth day, social media filled with images and video of police officers using batons, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell crowds?-but some squads joined in with Saturday protesters to express their stance against police brutality, and to show solidarity with the anti-racism movement.

&gt; In Santa Cruz, California, Police Chief Andy Mills took a knee with protesters in the pose made famous by Colin Kaepernick, with the department tweeting it was &amp;quot;In memory of George Floyd &amp; bringing attention to police violence against Black people.""

&gt; Over the past five days of protests, police were captured deploying tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists, along with numerous incidents of physical violence.

Ferguson PD, county, and state troopers were all there and deployed tear gas during the worst of it. If they abandoned the city I don’t think their police department would still be there.

Both he and his girlfriend are sorta antagonizing the police when they arrive and not responding to the commands.

I did too. Evangelical church in the south. The morality argument is what they’ve convinced themselves of to ignore the reality that their actions don’t mesh with their stated priorities. 

There’s a way to reduce abortions, and it’s the opposite of the anti-choice policy priority playbook.

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","https://data.unicef.org/topic/covid-19-and-children/    

 yea this is enough of a reason 

&gt; ""The UN predicted this month that the economic recession caused by COVID-19 lock-downs could increase the number of children living in monetary poverty by up to 86 million by the end of the year, an increase of 15 percent.""

plus 40,000,000 kicked off health insurance - 8 million not recieving unemployment but still fired - their jobs may disappear if economy goes into a recession which would mean we need 5-10 years to recover - which equates to millions of lives lost die to poverty, poverty is the #1 killer ya'll. 

more sources for you to see why protesting a recession creating policy makes sense, and is the OPPOSITE of being selfish 

So all 40,000,000 unemployed persons in the last 90 days aren't complaining about anything besides wanting a haircut? Is that a position you hold unironically? That is 40 million people losing health care. Don't even get me started on the 22% of Americans who are contractors who aren't eligible for unemployment, who are LITERALLY only being supported by communities or welfare rn

Who decides what a protest's message is about? The people protesting? or the people who disagree with the protests? If you ask reddit what the protests were about you're 100% right. Those idiots just wanted haircuts. Fucking f00ls!! that's called a straw-man argument. You use a really really bad argument from a few idiots and act like that's what everyone in the group believes.. Fucking ignorant tbh

I have seen maybe a dozen idiots protesting saying they want a haircut - - - and Reddit and MSM used that as fuel to minimize the concerns of the actual protest.

poverty created from recession will kill millions, if not hundreds of millions in 3rd world countries. Supply chains are precarious and we lost millions from the 2008 crash - which is on track to be much smaller than this crash. Every person I talked to who wanted to reopen was worried about the long term financial impacts of a recession outweighing the temporary pandemic's impact.

It will take time for the supply chain to actually show signs of an issue, but the longer we wait to reopen butchers and similar companies the longer the downtime will be when we run out of current inventory.

The UN predicted this month that the economic recession caused by COVID-19 lock-downs could increase the number of children living in monetary poverty by up to 86 million by the end of the year, an increase of 15 percent.

https://data.unicef.org/topic/covid-19-and-children/

Anyone who think lock-down protests are about convenience, and not about the deaths created by recessions, is not being honest or not spending the time to fully comprehend ""the other side""

---

Idk man maybe you have never actually lived in poverty? Have you ever decided to not eat so your kids can? Get you head around the fact that 8 million people are jobless, not getting unemployment and are only surviving because of friends and family. I have 3 friends who are ONLY FUCKING EATING RN BECAUSE OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Have you every had kids, bills and $214 dollars to your name? You think not working is an inconvenience, maybe because you haven't researched what economic recessions do to populations mental and physical health?

Now to justify the lock-down protests because you don't see the value:

(even if I couldn't see their side it's important to still let them speak their minds!! please don't suppress your fellow citizens's right to protest.)

Does unemployment have asymmetric effects on suicide rates? Evidence from the United States: 1928–2013

Our results suggest that there exist asymmetric effects of unemployment on suicide rates. Specifically, we found that the age-adjusted overall suicide rate falls during an economic boom period (in terms of a decrease in unemployment rate). An economic recession (in terms of an increase in unemployment rate) is more likely to increase the suicide rate among those in the old age group than among those in other age groups, while an economic expansion (in terms of a decrease in unemployment rate) is more likely to reduce the suicide rates of the young and middle age groups than their counterpart. Thus, several policy implications can be drawn from our empirical results. First, since the young and middle age groups represent a large proportion of the working population, any economic policy that could successfully stimulate the economy and reduce the unemployment rate could serve as an effective intervention to decrease the suicide rates of young and middle age groups and the age-adjusted overall suicide rate.

Global economic downturn linked with at least 260,000 excess cancer deaths

Boston, MA ─ The economic crisis of 2008-10, and the rise in unemployment that accompanied it, was associated with more than 260,000 excess cancer-related deaths—including many considered treatable—within the Organization for Economic Development (OECD), according to a study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Imperial College London, and Oxford University. The researchers found that excess cancer burden was mitigated in countries that had universal health coverage (UHC) and in those that increased public spending on health care during the study period.

"UFObelievers","t5_m0req","So your “religion” is science.  And where does quantum mechanics and multi-verse theory fit in - which would support IDH.  Atheist “scientists” tie themselves into (il)logical knots to avoid anything that starts to move into the supernatural realm.  What is the supernatural anyway?  Simply, intelligence and consciousness acting in another plane of existence that interacts with ours.  Frankly, the most enlightened discoveries come from “religious”  scientists as they tend to be much more open minded than their atheist counterparts.  Laughable indeed.

Regarding the space age and a perceived increase in UFO “recorded” activity - as you know correlation does not mean causation. Having said that, one theory concerning the (perceived) increase in UFO activity corresponding with atomic  weapons use is that atomic detonations have an adverse impact at a quantum (dimensional) level.  In other words, IDH entities are being directly impacted vs ET’s being concerned about Earth’s ecosystem.

And what does Astronomy have do with understanding UFO’s?  That’s like saying air explains birds.

Lastly, let me redefine “demonic” as a malevolent entity residing  in another dimension that has the ability to interact with our dimension and that is part of a larger intelligence or society that has an agenda to harm mankind for their benefit.  Their manifestation in our dimension can involve (among many other means) high energy plasma phenomena that has been perceived (and defined) as UFO’s in the 20th century.

Out of breath, I realized I needed to take a quick break before I ran any further.

Breath In: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

And breath out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

Breath in: 1, 2, 3…

After a bit I was able to regain my composure. Geez, was any of this worth it? Granted, this was only my third time, but I was still feeling worn out after just running for half an hour. Chris, that moron, had convinced me that running would be great, said that running changed his life. But then, when I decided to start, he hasn’t even bothered to join me these last few days. The next time I see him…

Nah, I was just a little tense, so I started to look around. It was sunny and the trees were green and the grass was green and fresh and I guess everything in general was nice to look at. There weren’t that many people out this morning, but I had seen a few, mostly older folks who I suppose had nothing better to do; but there was that one runner. While she seemed focused, I didn’t understand why she didn’t even give me notice when I had passed going the opposite way. I mean, come on, you can’t even notice another person?

So there I was, getting ready for a second wind, when a ball hit me in the back of the head. Annoyed I turned around and saw a young girl running down the hill towards me. Concerned, she apologized, and I gave her a mild “it’s alright.” Now smiling she started running up the hill back to the boy (brother?) who was waiting for her. They continued their game and, while I didn’t know why, I found their game somewhat interesting.

You see, the girl was acting as a pitcher and the boy had the bat. When he struck the ball, he ran around the imaginary diamond of the hill, running as fast as he could, as if someone would use the ball to take him out. But no one did, the girl had remained in her place, instead of trying to retrieve the ball. But as the boy continued running around the diamond, he looked over his shoulder, concerned and continued moving, until he finally stopped before making it home. 

Then, defeated, he and the girl traded off. For the first few moments I remained confused. Then I noticed something. Their shadows.

When the boy struck the ball, he started his run around the diamond… but his shadow started towards the ball. Then when it reached it, it started for the boy again, and when reaching him, he was out.

After about an hour, a man who had come down the path called them and they grabbed their bat and ball before running after him. While they were passing, I paid close attention to their shadows, which appeared quite attached. It occurred to me that I should be more disturbed by this but, for some reason, I was more envious. After all, they had more people playing their game than I had when I was their age. I continued to watch as the man, the kids, and their shadows, walked around the bend.

I took my shoes in hand and started for home. I was fed up with running (as well as being slightly concerned for my own sanity) and decided that it didn’t count as giving up if I had tried more than once. But while walking down the path, and watching where I stepped, I started to notice my own shadow, which was directly in front of me on the path. A slim figure, it seemed to be slightly off, before I realized it was not holding shoes like I was. Instead, I could see the outline of shoes on its feet. Then it pointed to its shoes. I shook my head. It then started to jog in place. I tried to ignore it as I continued walking. 

But then, continuing to jog, it started to move faster than I was, and I realized what it was doing.

Really?

It was soon further down the path and, somewhat disturbed at the idea of losing my shadow, I soon started running after it. I called for it to come back but it didn’t seem to respond so I proceeded. I realized I needed to gain speed to catch it.

I wasn’t really paying attention to the pain in my legs or how hard I was pushing myself, I was just focused on catching up with my shadow.

And I did, after a mile or two.

It was waiting for me at a water fountain. I took a good dozen gulps before shouting profanities at him. Then I started to laugh. 

He started his jogging in place again. I asked him to give me a minute.",1590969764

Santa was inconsolable since receiving his first notice of being audited by the IRS. Mrs. Claus had already left to stay with her mother, she couldn't be around Nicolas when he got like this, she brought the elves with her.  

After getting ripped on  fermented reindeer milk, Santa stumbled to his sleigh and decided it was time he ""put coal up somebody's ass."" He brought some Reindeer milk for the trip to ensure he didn't lose his nerve.  

Slipping into the IRS wasn't a tough job for a man who committed breaking and entering billions of times a year. His elf intelligence network had already assessed the naughty boy who would get a ""black stocking"" as Santa called it. Doctors could never explain how anybody managed to get coal that far up a human colon.  

George worked at the IRS and had thought it would be nice to prove to his son Santa existed by creating some paperwork for old Saint Nick. He didn't actually believe in Santa Claus, but some pretty definitive proof was in his office waiting for him.  

When George closed the door to his corner office behind him, Santa was there, waiting. Just as George thought he smelled some sort of gamy sour milk, large sweaty hands covered his mouth and pulled down his pants.

&gt; As protests sparked by George Floyd&amp;#039;s death entered their chaotic fifth day, social media filled with images and video of police officers using batons, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell crowds?-but some squads joined in with Saturday protesters to express their stance against police brutality, and to show solidarity with the anti-racism movement.

&gt; In Santa Cruz, California, Police Chief Andy Mills took a knee with protesters in the pose made famous by Colin Kaepernick, with the department tweeting it was &amp;quot;In memory of George Floyd &amp; bringing attention to police violence against Black people.""

&gt; Over the past five days of protests, police were captured deploying tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists, along with numerous incidents of physical violence.

"OsuSkins","t5_37afw","I think you seemed to have missed the main point of my arguement, the divide between people like you, who take skinning very seriously, and the more casual user base.

You say that the people who just want to make skins of their favourite anime, and etc exist, yet you still believe barraging them with so called ""feedback"" is a good idea. So how do we know if the skinner is serious about his work or not? Well you can't just see it at face value, like how you mentioned you can't tell a skinners vision. It seems to me that you expect everyone you come across who makes a decent looking skin should be held to professional standards. That's kinda unfair, and naive to expect that.

I understand that no one likes to have their work stolen, but some people who post their mixed skins never claim to have made the elements. They still get attacked though, by you. You're showing this skinning elitism in your comment, calling them lazy, copy pasters, when probably, that's all they can do at the moment.

""Most of skinners that treat their 'job' serious, know each other."" I don't understand what you're getting at here, especially with the followup remark. But you mention seeing skinners call bullshit on each other. Is this them treating their job seriously, calling out plagerism? Seems a little unprofessional to me.
Feedback is important, I agree, but it's the type of feedback that I'm calling out here. Constructive feedback is always welcome. But I see a lot of feedback that would otherwise be interpreted as an opinion, be given like a fact. It's like telling you that you SHOULD paint something green, not red, because it suits MY tastes. That's not constructive.

You seem to be sitting on a high horse here, since you are very active in this community, and give out a lot of comments. It seems that the skinners that take this seriously are more fond of you and maybe that feeds into your ego or something. You have this ideal that there should be no ""low effort"" skins (mixed or not), but that in itself is like booting an entire ""younger generation"" (as you put it) out. Almost like saying that if you're not good enough to start making out original elements, you don't belong here. Skinning elitism.

I'm not very fond of you, and have barely worked with you, but I can say for sure, that this professional standard that you make out to have isn't strong at all.

Edit* I should mentioned these guys are not to be handled often as they stress super easily. That's actually the main killer of these things.

Yes. I had an unwelcome but yet so necessary break from everything. My best friend got me psyched - involuntary hold. I was livid. But... my life was spiriling out of control: lupus and a lot of complications developing, chronic pain only being managed with narcotics, marriage broken up, nearly penniless...things were NOT good. There were other pressures, even more serious, but I don't want to discuss those here. 

In the hospital, while I didn't take part in many of the therapeutic things, I rested. I read books. I detoxed.  And when I felt better, I went to the hearing to get out, and started putting my life back together.   I like lists and things. Planning and checking off a list has helped me more than once get my life in order.

Don't be afraid OR ashamed to ask for help. Or accept help when it is offered.  Depression is a cruel mistress, and you need help to cope with it. 

I'm now 25 years down the road and in the happiest part of my life. There have been other depressions along the way (and I've long had a theory that being suicidal is more something you learn to live with than get rid of), but I've been able to manage thanks to that experience. And I really couldn't be happier. I have an amazing partner, and a good life. I am truly happy, and thankful every day.

It's not easy. Nothing is. But it can be dealt with. Just like you'd go to the Dr if you sprained an ankle or broke an arm. Your brain is part of your body, and the Dr can help it, too.

Hang on for today. Just today, for now. Do you need help OP?",1590969768
"MortalKombat","t5_2robf","V1 is probably the best imo. You get good mixup 50/50s from his hover move and converting from mb tornado is a lot easier than regular tornado. It’s probably his easiest variation to convert from as you get some very nice airborne options.

I wanted to use V2 but sky wakka is a bit broken in that you can’t turn it off without launching a very unsafe attack or using meter so it’s more a liability than an effective attack and if you don’t have any defensive meter you can’t combo after it either. Warped needle is very good though.

V3 I’ve not really tried much after a nasty 5-1 beating I took trying to use it against a casual amateur. The absence of a classic projectile in place of a choose your distance one makes it very difficult to use effectively against any opponent with a good fireball. It’s a 16frame startup that’s -5 on hit so that’s not great. Also wtf is that useless air parry move???",1590969768

Riots, looting, race wars. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said it himself: ""riots are the language of the unheard."" What do you expect people to do when they have been trying peaceful protests for so many years without any change? What do you expect people to do when they are mocked and told to just ""rise up"" when they are trying to change a systematic problem? Nothing is being done.

&gt; As protests sparked by George Floyd&amp;#039;s death entered their chaotic fifth day, social media filled with images and video of police officers using batons, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell crowds?-but some squads joined in with Saturday protesters to express their stance against police brutality, and to show solidarity with the anti-racism movement.

&gt; In Santa Cruz, California, Police Chief Andy Mills took a knee with protesters in the pose made famous by Colin Kaepernick, with the department tweeting it was &amp;quot;In memory of George Floyd &amp; bringing attention to police violence against Black people.""

&gt; Over the past five days of protests, police were captured deploying tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists, along with numerous incidents of physical violence.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","The reason politicians are so comfortable sending people to war is because our country has shifted all the pain and loss of war onto a relatively isolated/disenpowered group. Currently most members of the military are there because their family was in the military, they are poor, or they are immigrants. If you look at the fraction of Americans who are related to someone who has served, it has been declining since Vietnam. 

We live in a democracy, so politicians only face backlash for sending soldiers on long tours in foreign countries if those soldiers are from their districts. The draft in Vietnam may have been targeted at poor/non-white Americans, but it resulted in widespread protests that nearly turned the country upside down within 3 years of heavy involvement in the conflict. A law requiring some form of a draft if congress sends a substantial number of US soldiers to war for longer than 12 months would put enough political pressure on politicians to make any war have to be worth it. 

As is we are seeing a development of a military caste within our society, I noticed while I was in ROTC (had to leave due to a medical discharge after being contracted), that 80% or more of the cadets who were in the program either had parents in the military or were prior service. And that is just for the officer corp, it extends to a lot of the enlisted as well. Politicians feel fine sending soldiers off on multiple long tours because they face basically no backlash for it. And that kind of system has destroyed the kinds of soldiers that suffer the most, senior NCOs. Between 2004 and 2014 the US army suffered enormous attrition on its NCO corp, the average age and experience of E7's and above has decreased since the army was losing them at an incredible rate due to the endless cycles of touring and deployments.",1590969769

"dating","t5_2qhb1","27 F here, I've been playing videogames since I was 8yo, and in my experience a lot of guys say they want a gamer girl but in reality they fantasize about the stereotype of one, and there are millions of videogames, maybe you like to play adventure games and she'd like mmorpg more.. 

Your hobby doesn't define you, I mean is amazing to have someone to play with but you have to consider other qualities in your partner as well.

Maybe you can find someone and show her your videogames or teach her, there are many amazing games that you can play with someone who hasnt played a lot, if you have a switch basically any multiplayer game is interesting for any person because they're easy and fun, or in steam if you prefer playing in pc search casual games.

You can meet a girl and introduce her to videogames, and she would introduce you to her interest as well :) be open about it and eventually you'll meet someone.",1590969769

We have good scientific evidence that this causes cognitive damage and perpetuates cycles of crime and abuse.  We also have good evidence of racism in the  police force and continual harassment of black people, who go to jail longer, die more often, get pulled over more often, etc - all of which feed back in to the cycles.

I think the above is OK... basically all 5 of them are extremely popular for DD3.  I do see that you have no protector and no cleanse on the team... which means bad RNG could drop Minny and you’d have no way to revive... but that’s not the end of the world, even if it takes you a month or so to roll through DD2, you’ll use that time preparing to G14 those 5 (and your Global node folks).  Ultron isn’t as critical anymore that you need to rush it (albeit still super strong, but not for DD3).

Also, you’ll likely bring in Phoenix/Colossus before finishing DD2... so you can slot them in as needed eventually as well.   That also gives you two for global (maybe sinister is the third)...

Colby grads get into top grad schools and have a strong alumni association. 14,000 applied this year and 9.4% admitted.  The Ivy that comes the closest to Colby is probably Dartmouth. Students choose LACs because that is the kind of education they want, as opposed to a large university. As for ""social circle"" there is not one circle, and every student can find a niche or make their own.

Colby does take a substantial # of internationals, but this year may be the exception.",1590969770

Example: GW2 citron before his rework, bfn all-star, bfn foot solider, GW2 freeze meta, BFN rose, and GW2 launch rose. GW1 didnt really have these issues.

All things considered, no.

I feel like if you look at it like Re Mind Scenario + Limit Cut + Secret Episode = $20 and EZ/Pro Codes + Premium Menu = $10 then the pricing is well justified. People really don't understand how difficult it is to get this shit right, and clearly the team spent a lot of time (the bulk of it, in fact) making sure these superbosses would be done justice, and they went above and beyond what anyone would have expected. 

The problem is that they heavily marketed the Re Mind scenario which led people to believe that would make up the bulk of the package. It's understandable why they would feel gypped, even if they are responsible for choosing to ignore the secret bosses.

At the end of the day, I'd rather pay Re Mind's price than have to buy the whole game again to get the additional content.",1590969773

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Flat earth Theory is great for people who lack critical thinking skills. Here are some things that disprove flat eart:

Gravity. The weight of the earth is so great that literally no mineral on earth is strong enough to support the weight of all that mass. So, the earth simply fell into the closest proximity to the center of gravity. 

Air. Air actually weighs a lot. If the earth was flat, the air would fall off of the edge, and would settle closest to the center of gravity. This is why air pressure is more of less equal at any given place on the globe ( provided its at the same altitude, and slight variations caused by weather. 

Seasons, it’s winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and summers in the northern hemisphere. That wouldn’t happen on a flat earth. 

Seasonal variations in daylight hours. I live in a place where at the peak of daylight it scarcely gets dark, and in the darkest day of winters there are only a few hours of low angle sunlight. That wouldn’t happen on a flat earth. Etc etc etc.

&gt; As protests sparked by George Floyd&amp;#039;s death entered their chaotic fifth day, social media filled with images and video of police officers using batons, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell crowds?-but some squads joined in with Saturday protesters to express their stance against police brutality, and to show solidarity with the anti-racism movement.

&gt; In Santa Cruz, California, Police Chief Andy Mills took a knee with protesters in the pose made famous by Colin Kaepernick, with the department tweeting it was &amp;quot;In memory of George Floyd &amp; bringing attention to police violence against Black people.""

&gt; Over the past five days of protests, police were captured deploying tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists, along with numerous incidents of physical violence.

"AzureLane","t5_3p20d","&gt;And the most important part. In what context.

That's exactly right.

For example, I believe that Amagi slipped to T1 on Usagi's tier list, but that's because of her low AA in world 13. I find her thanos snap to be invaluable vs beefy event enemies/ex bosses and she gives great utility and amazing barrage damage when I can sortie her alongside ships with enough AA to make up the difference (ie: Sandy kai)

Contrasting that I find that using Nagato really limits your fleet composition for the strengths she brings to the table. Her barrage is the very definition of a screen-clearer but the low proc rate makes it unreliable at best and non-existent at worst.

I remember for the longest time that Saratoga Kai was in a relatively lower tier generally accepted as inferior to Enterprise, but I found her more consistent higher damage to be more useful then relying on Procs. At the same time, Lusty used to be T0 for AA and vanguard protection, but I never found my vanguard coming in mortal danger as opposed to my backline, which rather frequently was getting bullied by enemy BBs.

It's the whole ""teach a man to fish"" concept at work. The tier lists are useful as *reference* but they're not to be taken as gospel",1590969775

"MachineLearning","t5_2r3gv","The first thing that comes to my mind when we are talking about dimensionality reduction is that the N number of features you have chosen to use in your algorithm may not correspond to N different independent dimensions.

You can have two different reasons to do such an analysis. The first is to have a more efficient algorithm which matters when your data set is very large.

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","&gt;He has been horrible in selling fights as well.

He's the number two draw in the sport in the active roster, and has been for nearly a decade. Other than whatever current super star is active (GSP, Conor, Ronda, Brock), Jones is always the highest consistent draw, and he's routinely on shitty cards.

&gt;Why would he deserve a raise in a contract he negotiated?

Because he's arguing that he's taking additional risk and challenge beyond his expected contractual duties by moving up and fighting someone who weighs in almost 45lbs more? 

Did you really need someone to type that out? You can disagree with it, that's fine, but it's beyond obvious why he's asking for more. 

Considering the ESPN deal has completely devastated PPV buyrates, which is by FAR the number one way Jones would generate income for himself, it's only fair that he be additionally compensated to achieve the same payday this fight would have generated for him prior to the ESPN deal. 

The ESPN deal, in which you know, he had no input or decision on despite *directly* influencing his personal finances. In literally any other sport he would have had the ability to veto that deal, or at the very least renegotiate his existing contract, in which he would have asked for a much higher flat fee. 

&gt; Especially during a time where there are literally ZERO fans in attendance.

This is a meaningless argument for many reasons. First of all, the UFC denied negotiations like this prior to the pandemic and will after.

Secondly, the fighters don't generate income from the gate and it doesn't factor into their contracts, so why should they exclusively bear the burden of it when negotiating? It doesn't make any sense.",1590969776

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I stopped DMing near the end of a campaign and let it fizzle out because I just wasn't having fun.

My husband was a great player, but the rest of the table really didn't have great attitudes. One of them wouldn't really pay attention, another would act disappointed no matter what loot I gave her, as if I just kept giving her the wrong stuff, and the other would go ""FUCK YOUUUU"" when the enemies passed their saves against his abilities. I really didn't need to spend hours prepping only to be cursed at. 

I think my last straw was when I had them fight a group of villains that had been pulling the strings the whole time, and a few seconds into the villain monologue, one of the players interrupts me to say ""I Fireball him while he's talking"". Maybe it's a bit cliche to have the villain explain their plans, but it really hurt that he didn't seem to care in the slightest about the intricacies of the story or who the villains were or even just the fact that maybe I myself wanted to get some enjoyment from the scene.",1590969777

&gt; As protests sparked by George Floyd&amp;#039;s death entered their chaotic fifth day, social media filled with images and video of police officers using batons, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell crowds?-but some squads joined in with Saturday protesters to express their stance against police brutality, and to show solidarity with the anti-racism movement.

&gt; In Santa Cruz, California, Police Chief Andy Mills took a knee with protesters in the pose made famous by Colin Kaepernick, with the department tweeting it was &amp;quot;In memory of George Floyd &amp; bringing attention to police violence against Black people.""

&gt; Over the past five days of protests, police were captured deploying tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists, along with numerous incidents of physical violence.

It is nearly impossible to differentiate between the two in the heat-of-the-moment. The behavior by police in this video constitutes a clear and present danger to the lives of the people on that porch - they are morally (and if it wasn't cops, would be legally) justified in returning fire in the interest of self-preservation. Even rubber bullets kill and blind hundreds of people per year.

The stay-at-home order in Minneapolis clearly only states not to congregate ""in public places"". Your front porch is not a public place. You should be allowed to sit out front, drinking a beer with your cellphone out and not be afraid that a roving militia of jackbooted thugs are going to march down your street screaming Call of Duty lines and firing projectiles at you with the intent to kill or seriously injure.

So far every person I've met who has identified as a traveller has been an ignorant, selfish, and greedy twat. I don't care why they're like that, if they hid it better then I'd have less of a bias towards travellers as a whole, and quite frankly I have other things to deal with in my life than figuring out why someone who demands that their transgressions against the social contract be absolved somehow still tries to act the victim if you do anything other than appease them deserves any respect.

I'm not going go around commenting ""It's culture boss"" but I probably wouldn't piss on a traveller if they were on fire, I'm not claiming any moral highground here I just feel like as a society we have a thousand other problems which need to be tackled before we get down the list to this one.

why _that_ is the case (police interactions higher among black population) is another discussion. i’m not saying there isn’t racism at the root somewhere, but the story appears to go deeper than police brutality. police seem to kill indiscriminately. 

my non-expert view is that institutional racism has resulted in black people generally being poorer, less-advantaged and living in worse situations and therefore ending up with more crime in their communities. notice that this doesn’t excuse or deny racism - but it does remove it from the police murder equation. police murder civilians, period. it’s everyone’s problem.",1590969779

"idlechampions","t5_3m36u","&gt; They're just talking about mechanics such as Nova's which create a new class of champions that outscale normal champions once you go deep enough in levels. For example, what if Nova is not BiS at level 1 but becomes BiS at level 500? She would be unique in that regard.  
  
The only way I can see Nova's scaling to be anywhere near valuable (remember, BV has a similar scaling mechanic) is if the mechanic was added in and not considered as part of her normal buff. For example - if competing champions gave e10 buff, and Nova also gave e10 without her brain drops factored in, then I can see value in it. But for the most part, CNE has crippled the default buff values (like BV) in consideration for the scaling factor. So if her default value ended up being something like e6, she doesn't have any chance of competing with e10 levels even with her brain drops.   
  
There's ALSO the mysterious Aerois Synergy that has yet to be released on her, so I'm highly skeptical she will be of any value outside of a 2nd tank for newbies at launch. Later? Might be good since Qillek and Aila are both highly used.",1590969780

I'm torn here, because it technically is within the Target's rights to refuse to offer service for any reason, however it's undoubtedly immoral for them to do so in this case. But even if the Target did that, I think from a pragmatic standpoint it's not a good idea. Burning it down isn't going to hurt Target, it's going to hurt the people who work at that Target, who are probably just minimum wage workers trying to get by. Removing their source of income isn't exactly going to warm them to your cause. 

I do believe that violence by the cops was inevitable, but I think giving them the excuse of ""protecting the community!""

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;I don't think that's true. IG wasn't favored even by LPL analysts because they kept throwing against RNG, which was stupid imo. But still, I think even people that watched LPL were downplaying them for weird reasons.

It just shows that favorites rarely win anymore but continue to be favorites.

&gt;But FPX was hyped as THE FAVORITE by Western analysts and was one of the favorites to win even by Western viewers.

That is some revisionist history right there. Aside from Kobe, all eyes were on SKT and G2. G2 had the grand slam narrative going just like RNG did, and SKT won both LCK splits with a super team. 

FPX were unknowns. Western analysts didn't even watch LPL, unless they were working in the LPL. 

&gt;It wasn't until that game they dropped in groups with LWX playing like garbage that everyone assumed they were overhyped and somehow that carried on for the rest of the tournament.

No, it's that most people had never even heard of FPX or any of its players before the tournament started. I am talking about *before* the tournament begins, not after. SKT and G2 were the favorites, 1 or 2 depending on who you ask.

Find me a *pre-tournament* ranking that put FPX at #1. Even the LPL analysts did not put them at #1. Everyone always gives deference to LCK's #1 team, and last year because G2 had an undefeated run, they had to get the nod also. And they continue to give deference to LCK. Going into MSC, T1 were still seen as favorites to win it all.",1590969780

But regardless many people are still probably frustrated about it. Up until a year ago I was use to watching most things on my computer until I got a Roku TV and now its REALLY hard to go back to that because I been so spoiled lol.

Hopefully a deal will be struck soon and it probably will be because let's face it, Roku has the power here and Max is missing out on millions of users.

"ChiefKeef","t5_2u3sg","&gt;he used to be in glo gang haha

More like ""ya you in"". At show he opened up for him or something. 
*
Nothing is signed officially, chief keef doesnt see lucki ever. It fizzles and dies. (I think its possible lucki declined the offer and it was mutual). Hes recently been putting out videos getting a nillion views in under a couple weeks (aka you made it). 

So i think chef can't ignore luckis popularity finally being exposed. Dudes constantly named especially in chicago as the best known underground artist there is. His music doesn't glorify drug use as much as showcase how horrible it can be. He does romantize the lifestyle but i can't imagine him getting radio attention because his genre is like chief keef and nirvana had a baby that surrives on xanax bars, drinking lean, and snorting roxicodone. Its so sad it vsn be funny. 
""She got bored of me becsuse i kept nodding off and sleeping on the Flordia beach""
""Lets die now fuck a sunset""
""She take pinks (10mg oxycodone), i take blues (30mg oxycodone) its our wedding ring""
His video for xan cage is spot on, you feel trapped. 
Wouldn't be surprised if he was snorting coke, only way to be productive with all that in your system. Can't eat molly everyday, and he hasn't mentioned adderall like Future.

He should be glo gang but then i feel bad he might go the way flash did/is and lumps out 16 song mixtapes every month with 1 good song.

Chief keef is goat. Lucki is amazing. But i just don't think chief is a very label owner, Durk pushed King Von. 21 Savage pushed young nudy. The only one i have seen him successfully push is Tadoe and Tadoe is tied thicker to his waist then his louie belt.",1590969781

"BravoRealHousewives","t5_2v6dk","I like to send them these excerpts from Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1963:



“ You deplore the demonstrations that are presently taking place in Birmingham. But I am sorry that your statement did not express a similar concern for the conditions that brought the demonstrations into being. I am sure that each of you would want to go beyond the superficial social analyst who looks merely at effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. I would not hesitate to say that it is unfortunate that so-called demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham at this time, but I would say in more emphatic terms that it is even more unfortunate that the white power structure of this city left the Negro community with no other alternative.

I MUST make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.“",1590969783

"spelunky","t5_2sk9c","You can sometimes luck into getting the bm for free by making an orange frog explode it open.  Rare but not incredibly so.  

You can definitely kill Anubis with 1 or 0 bombs used.  Often luring him to get spiked out on a tiki trap, or luring a thwomp (crush trap) to crush his bottom half (the scepter spawns from his top half so crushing his head also crushes the scepter).  Sometimes he dies right at level generation, most commonly in a ceiling trap room.  And even if you do have to resort to killing him via two explosions, often one of them is a land mine you carried in from 3-4 (the rules of low% allow you to carry and use environmental objects including land mines).

Anubis 2 will follow you into Olmec’s room, which is good because Olmec himself can hurt and kill Anubis 2 for you. 

The city of gold central room is virtually impossible to access without resources though.   In theory there can be a trapped chest in the city of gold that you open in a place that its bomb makes the hole you need.  In practice - this is so incredibly improbable as to be mostly a theoretical exercise.

0 bombs for Olmec and Yama is not a concern. The people who practice these runs have no-bomb strategies for each.  The crucial resource for the yama fight is actually ropes.  For me the fight is easy with 2 ropes, very difficult with only 1, and extremely unlikely (I have done it, but failed many more times) with 0.


Also worth noting - since you don’t need the Udjat Eye to find the Black Market, it’s specifically excluded as an allowable item in low hell.  If you can’t just find the black market with your eyes ... that run wasn’t meant to be low hell.  You’re allowed the ankh, the hedjet, the book of the dead ... and you’re allowed to carry the scepter but not fire it.  (That’s actually the rule for all weapons).",1590969783

&gt; As protests sparked by George Floyd&amp;#039;s death entered their chaotic fifth day, social media filled with images and video of police officers using batons, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell crowds?-but some squads joined in with Saturday protesters to express their stance against police brutality, and to show solidarity with the anti-racism movement.

&gt; In Santa Cruz, California, Police Chief Andy Mills took a knee with protesters in the pose made famous by Colin Kaepernick, with the department tweeting it was &amp;quot;In memory of George Floyd &amp; bringing attention to police violence against Black people.""

&gt; Over the past five days of protests, police were captured deploying tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists, along with numerous incidents of physical violence.

You realize that we are in a Minneapolis subreddit right? there is a reason why you applauded that user by telling him “GOOD WORK”, any personal information CAN be linked back to someone, it doesn’t take a genius to realize that it’s happened multiple times before on reddit with even less information.  It’s usually not even a random person who ‘ties it together’, its usually someone close to the victim. 


&gt; ididn’t know it was disgraceful to question why people might be behaving suspiciously during a riot, especially when they themselves did not offer a plausible explanation when given the chance.



It’s disgraceful to base your suspicion solely on someone’s appearance, because it was quite obvious from the video that the jackass was accosting them with absolutely zero evidence &amp; they told him all they wanted to tell them.... you’re actually stupid if you think it would have been a good idea to give them anymore information than they already gave- if they told the name of the business they owned, you would’ve fucking blasted them just like you were in the last post...

You specifically are also a disgrace, you still fail to take even a shred of responsibility after being totally wrong in your ‘suspicion’ (btw you weren’t questioning jack shit, you deemed them as being guilty the second that video ended of whatever allegations they were being accused of), including your actions of enabling a doxer.",1590969784

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","He would lean into the strong work ethic and rule of law.  Those that don't have anything are weak, haven't worked hard enough and as a result do not deserve the wealth that comes with that hard work.  They would despise flippant individuals who earnt they're wealth through inheritance.  However a royal succession would be important but they would be opposed to inheritors of said bloodline who are lazy and skate by on that inheritance.  They would expect them to devote themselves to their kingdom and the maintenance of order.

They would be in favour of a strong arm of the law as chaos is unacceptable in their eyes.

I think the primary difference between a LG Paladin and LE Tyrant of Abadar is caring about the people.  A Paladin wants to maintain order in the cities so that the people are safe and have a good life.  A Tyrant wants to maintain order for order's sake and is willing to do anything for this ideal.  The difference between a Constitutional Republic and a Fascist police state.

A paladin would also see that people are suffering and not due to a lack of hard work but due to oppression or circumstances outside their control.

Both viewpoints can be seen through the lens of Abadar's teachings but taken to either side of the same coin.",1590969785

"Kuwait","t5_2qzc1","OP you have to get used to biases &amp; opinions, this is not unique to Kuwait and will never be. The United States always gets bashed at by the British, Canadians and French for being hostile and backwards in their own standards, the French also insult the British and vice versa. Such opinions do not matter in world politics and are only restricted to personal biases, if you are a Kuwaiti, Saudi, Bahraini or Qatari you'd not only get bashed at by Egyptians but Syrians, Palestinians, Jordanians and more abroad. Even Turks hate us, people do not want to refrain from generalizing. It is much easier for them and simpler to generalize a whole nationality/race/ethnicity over the behavior of a selected group, it all depends on personal exposure.

If for instance you were to be exposed to a number of Egyptians in your life-time to which you wish you had never met them, you are more likely to generalize that Egyptians are scammers, liars, uncouth, brash or whatever synonym you may use to justify your hatred towards them. It all goes back to personal exposure, but that is all it is personal exposure.

Another example would be that some western women tend to have a mind-set that Arabs aren't trustworthy when it comes to dating, and that they would abandon them after a short period of time. Why would they say that? Obviously because they were exposed to a selective group and they had bad experienced with such a group, or they listened to their friends and justified that Arabs tend to be that way. It is very difficult for a human not to refrain from generalizing, and during this pandemic you can be sure that a lot of people are hating Chinese people. Because we have been exposed to it and we would insult any Chinese person (I do not refer to me here) even if that Chinese person was from Hong Kong or Taiwan or the United States. 

Thus I conclude that it all comes back to personal exposure and not politics, trust me the last thing the Kuwaiti government wants is conflict with the Egyptian government though I must say that there has been exceptions whereas the Egyptian government has been rather disrespectful, but conflicts can be resolved and that is what we want eventually. 

In regards to the false information that has been spread, I think that there should be some corrections made but with the utmost respect so that it wouldn't lead to further conflict. Personally, I would be angry and would engage verbally but politically on a platform I think refraining from that would be best as we address this sort of misinformation that has been going on, as far as I know I haven't heard anything so you could update us on it more.",1590969785

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","Most don't realize just how young of a country the US is. Most countries have several instances throughout history of being oppressed, some more recent than others (independence of former colonies and the european countries involved in the world wars) where in many of those instances you even still have people alive from those times. The US, while it had racial oppression of the same caliber in a similar timeframe, hasn't, it was a matter of a minority fighting against their own freedom, but that wasn't the **country** fighting for its freedom. The United States, the country, has never had to fight for freedom in its short existence, even when fighting against the British for independence it wasn't a matter of fighting against oppression, it was a matter of politics and it was never an ""all or nothing"" fight like other colonies had with their own fights for independence, easily explained because, unlike those other former colonies, the US's fight was **with** its colonizers, not against them, and civil wars, too, are also different from fighting for your freedom, even if it too is about fighting your own country.  

Meanwhile, during WWII alone half of western europe was under dictatorship. The US never had a first-hand showing of this and never had to fight for its own freedom, never needed its people to physically fight its own government, and that's the difference between a civil war and what I'm talking about - a civil war is about one side of the population fighting against another side of the population, what I'm talking about is **all** of the people fighting against their **government** and armed forces. When you don't have that kind of perspective, it's easy to fool yourself into thinking that ""it can't happen to us, we're a developed, democratic country!"".  

From my own point of view and what happened in my own country, what Putin and Trump have done during their times in office, manipulating the law once already in office to gradually remove or skirt around the measures put in place to make it harder or impossible to legally remove them from office, is similar to what happened to us.",1590969785

&gt; As protests sparked by George Floyd&amp;#039;s death entered their chaotic fifth day, social media filled with images and video of police officers using batons, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell crowds?-but some squads joined in with Saturday protesters to express their stance against police brutality, and to show solidarity with the anti-racism movement.

&gt; In Santa Cruz, California, Police Chief Andy Mills took a knee with protesters in the pose made famous by Colin Kaepernick, with the department tweeting it was &amp;quot;In memory of George Floyd &amp; bringing attention to police violence against Black people.""

&gt; Over the past five days of protests, police were captured deploying tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists, along with numerous incidents of physical violence.

Huh? It’s my [second sentence](https://old.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/gt9yf1/trump_announces_us_to_sever_all_ties_with_who_us/fsdfa0i/).

&gt; You're totally off for the rationale. Please read the timeline as it clearly indicates that WHO did not want to sow fear or interrupt trade through travel bans.

No and yes. That was one rationale, but not the only rationale. Look at what the director [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-who-idUSKBN1ZX1H3):

“First, there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn’t recommend limiting trade and movement. **We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.**”

That’s exactly the point. Travel bans are not evidence based and not consistent unless you ban all travel.

On the flip side; education, resources for communities such as music or parks, have decreased in funding when things get tough. So, yes, America just focuses on being strong and scary to the world, rather than fix the issues we have or working towards a better tomorrow. Don’t be shocked. America has been upfront the whole time.    


Don’t lose hope. America has some amazing people in it. Some of the smartest, most successful, kindest, most diverse people live here and want to keep it afloat.

Once when i dared to wear a tight fitting (opaque) crop top without a bra in the living room, she exclaimed “damn you look like your t*ts are fake!!” Another time she told me i should be happy with my bust size bc it’s a “dude magnet” (she knows I’m not straight).

"preppers","t5_2riow","&gt; What are some ways for a low income family to prepare for a civil war?  Who knows what's coming? I don't. How do we prepare for the worst?

The same ways as always.  Take care of yourself physically and mentally.  Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, and other things that can lead you down an unhealthy path.  And avoid people whose drama could suck you in to trouble.  Exercise and eat as well as you are able to afford.  Use education and other pathways to increase your income.  Spend wisely and build savings and an emergency fund.  Invest in your kids.  Work with other loved ones to help each other rise.  

Put some food by for hard times.  Not expensive disaster food, just the basics of rice, beans, cans of tomatoes, corn, tuna, chicken.  Learn how to cook from scratch.  Pack a go bag.  Get rid of stuff you don’t need.  Keep your things in good repair.

Get to know your neighbors, regardless of their politics.  Help them in small and friendly ways; even simply exchanging greetings when you pass them by on an evening walk can be a friendly gesture.  Work in community organizations to strengthen the community - a community garden, a scouting group, helping the elderly.  Join a hobby club or a sports league.  Volunteer at your place of worship.  Get to know a wide variety of people.  Focus on what you have in common, not what sets you apart from one another.",1590969788

So even if they don't have any hatred towards POC (in this case black ppl), things that they do may have a negative impact on POC because the society we live in sacrifices the safety and comfort of POC to accommodate the safety and comfort of white people. They are privileged enough to be able to maneuver through life without thinking about race relations and white supremacy. So they don't understand why POC have so much resentment and feel attacked when we point out how we've been mistreated due to white supremacy. They think we're all on an equal playing field, but fail to realize that their privilege allows them to not see the historical context behind these issues. They don't understand how things they may view as ""not a big deal"" has hurt POC for generations.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I posted this in /r/nfl the other day but I think it gets the point across. I simply think that kneeling during the anthem was too ambiguous, unless you digged in further and did some research it wasn't immediately obvious that he was protesting police brutality. And if people can't immediately know what you're protesting, then your message is going to get distorted.

&gt;Absolutely. He wanted to protest against the systemic racism and specifically how black people are treated by cops. Perfectly fine. But the fact is kneeling during the national anthem is not the best way to do that. Not because the flag or national anthem or America is some godly figure that can't be protested, but because people watching on TV cannot figure out what you are protesting without additional context. It was too easy for any media company/newspaper to show it as ""Kap hates America and Americans"" because there is nothing about the national anthem that has anything to do with cops specifically. And sure you can say ""well people could look into it and figure out what he was trying to do"" but we all know 99.99% of people aren't going to do that.

Just cause old democrats follow Republican Party now based on policy doesn’t make all white republicans or trumpers racist or democrats. Yankees hate those racist fucks too bro. Just like some black people are telling others not to riot.
The problem is that u can’t request that all blacks people be blamed for some black peoples crimes while blaming al white people for one white mans crimes. That’s called HYPOCRISY and you become the same as a religion. Slippery slope bro. Just trying to inform people that there are whites and trumpers on your side. Do t alienate them.

 you claim that ""this"" is misinformation, whatever ""this"" refers to, but then you follow with a ""probably"" statement:

Do you know that in a debate you lost 2 points already? Are you real?

Moreover, you follow with a weak argument:

&gt;this person is obsessed with spelling reform

""Obsessed"" or ""passionate"". Do you know the difference? Or are you intentionally reframing my right to inform? Your claim that 5 comments in a thread that contains hundreds demonstrate the obsession. Are you for real?

Furthermore, you claim that I expect people to be obsessed. That is misinformation AGAIN. You don't substantiate that claim with anything. Did I hold a gun to everyone's head. Are you real?

Then, you have the audacity and stupidity to admit that you ""reported"" me.

It seems that YOU are obsessed in preventing someone (me and anyone I assume) to inform the public about this issue. It is YOU who is obsessed. YOU are trying to misinform the public by censoring people. YOU are sick in the head. Your arguments are unsubstantiated and illogical.

It doesn't honor George Floyd's legacy and is against the wishes of his family and the peaceful protest organization's wishes. And it adds insult by giving fuel to the fire of white nationalists and diverts the focus from the main issue - systemic injustice.",1590969790

Steve Earle is a socialist. He has a lot of songs that reflect that. Christmas In Washington is a great one. He music has gotten more politically charged as time goes on but I think he's always been a radical leftist.

Drive-By Truckers are super politcal. They are a southern rock band from Alabama. Their album American Band is very much worth a listen. It covers police brutality, the NRA, school shootings, censorship. They have an older album called Southern Rock Opera which is almost entirely about Lynyrd Skynyrd, George Wallace and the 2 singer/songwriters relationship with the south.

I dont exactly know the exact politics of these artists but here are some political country songs: 

Jason Isbell - White Mans World 

American Aquarium - A Better South

James McMurtry - Cheneys Toy, We Can't Make It Here Anymore

Sturgill Simpson - Call To Arms 

Slaid Cleaves - Rust Belt Fields 

Margo Price - All American Made 

Reckless Kelly - American Blood

Johnny Cash - The Ballad of Ira Hayes (You probably already know this one but it's worth mentioning)

Ray Wylie Hubbard - Conversation with the Devil",1590969792

So say have episodes that acknowledge that public trust towards the force has taken a serious knocking, especially from minority communities, and that the country itself isn't exactly in the best state in the moment, thus its all the more important for everyone to do their jobs right.

Or how it is behind the scenes, with some officers doubling down they need to support each other, others feeling a bit uncomfortable, and perhaps more politics cause no one wants another scandal.

To me that would probably be for the best. No need to preach that these guys aren't that sort of cops or that situations like this shouldn't happen, everyone already knows that. Besides its probably safe to say all of this will have stopped by the time the show airs, with any luck everyone will be able to move forward (hopefully on a path that ensures it doesn't happen again) but the wounds are still going to be reasonably fresh, so no point reopening them.",1590969792

Yes, this country was founded in the backs of slaves, and immigrants as well as whites. But this is an extremely young country in the scope of things and we’ve made tremendous strives in what took other nations hundreds of years. 

We all have flaws and are biased to what we experience on a daily basis because we believe what our eyes see. You see these terrible things going around in circles in which you associate and I’ve see complete disregard for race Amongst mine. I’ve grown up in a relatively black neighborhood and have been racially targeted because of my skin color before.

That’s not saying I don’t believe you, I see it. I see it on twitter on here in my friends discussions. But I also know cops who are some of the best people I’ve known and it kills me to see the people they protect so angry at them for the actions of bad people.

Why would you call them concentration camps? If we are being genuine here please, why that term. I hope we can both agree that they aren’t comparable to concentration camps. And we could have a whole other discussion about the conditions there im sure.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to remember about the Old testament is its not all literal (i.e. it happened literally as the bible says)  A great example is God creating the earth in seven days.  To take it as literaly being seven days would be a bit silly, not because God cannot do so, but because science tells us that this is not true.  Does that mean God didnt make the earth?  Heck no.  Remember, God exists outside of time, the days are merely there as a way to indicate the passage of time for us humans.  A day to God could be the equivalent of anywhere from a second to a billion years to us.

&amp;#x200B;

IN regards to the Noah story, much like the story of Earth Creation we cannot take it as literal.  But that being said, historians agree that some sort of flooding affected the Mediteranian area, specifically around Mesopotamia thousands of years ago.  Historians arent a hundred percent certain on when it happened, or what caused it, but we know that it happened.  Such an event like that, that impacted an entire region, would be recorded and remembered by every group of people involved.  Hence why the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Old Testaments story of Noah seem very similiar.  Its not that they were plagiarizing each other buy merely recording the same event from two different perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

Atheists like to try to point to Christianity having similarities to other religions as an example that Christianity is ""fake"".  But the biggest flaw with that argument is that they fail to recognize that religion is also a history.  Many of the events that are recorded in the old testament pre-date written words, but they were oral histories passed down through generations.  Just because the story is about a religion does not change its historiocity.  

&amp;#x200B;

The Epic of Gilgamesh and Noahs ark are both recounting the same event that affected two different groups of people.  Both are histories of said event.  To Jews (and christians) the flooding is seen as Gods punishment for the sins of mankind.",1590969793

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","Thanks for the response. You and I actually agree about a LOT. I too wish for an outcome with equality and civil rights being instituted for all. I’m also harshly critical of the powers that be; the the corruption existing between both state and corrupt corporations. My question, though I realize is a silly hypothetical in the grand scheme of reality, is really to try to hone in on more of a legal and moral philosophy. In the case of George Floyd, there were four aggressors. One was tried, and we’re still seeking justice for the other three. Great. Justice served?

You might now extrapolate this to the system at large. Let’s hold the state accountable. Let’s push for laws that ensure equality for all. I’m all for this. But there is a time and a place for violence. Violence is force, and there are times where it makes sense and is justified. There are times when it is not, and the aggressors must be held accountable.

Even in the American Revolution, I admit this Is a just use for force and violence. Aggressors were on US soil trying to imprison and kill. It was based on the refusal for people to let these aggressors steal their property (via unjust taxation).

Fast forward to this weekend. Patrick Underwood is an innocent African American man murdered by rioters in Oakland this weekend. Does he not deserve justice? Are his aggressors not to be held accountable? Why not? Because of a cause? What then distinguishes the police killing George Floyd from the rioters who murdered Patrick Underwood?

I ask not for arbitrary “gotchas!” but to hone in on the moral and principled framework to make sense of anything here beyond justifying mob rule.

If you give a carte blanche moral pass to violence without a moral and legal framework, (i.e. non aggression principle; except in the case of protecting one’s rights), you are on a slippery slope to tyranny where anyone can justify any use of violence.

Murdering Patrick isn’t helping the cause. He didn’t do shit to anyone. A business owner murdered didn’t do shit to infringe on anyone’s rights.

There is justified violence, I will admit, but it should be focused on the perpetrators (if there is no other reasonable alternative) and NOT the innocent.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;Right now you can be sued for absolutely anything. And it will be at the judgment of the government how that turns out. 

This is... completely wrong. If I say ""This politician is a piece of shit."" I can only be sued for that in the most basic way that maybe someone could waste money to file a lawsuit that will be immediately thrown out by the first judge that sees it. We have rights for a reason.

&gt;Technically, based on your first example you would actually want the change that has been proposed cause then when (not if) you’re sure you have some level of protection.

...what? Which first example? Where I mentioned making a website that prohibits bigotry and rudeness? Why would I want to change that. You're already protected if you choose to do that.

&gt;As for letting the government decide, that’s basically the entire premise of a society based on the rule of law rather than mob justice.

Under the option you're suggesting, government officials have the power to subjectively strip the legal protections from any website they dislike by declaring that they're moderating in a way that is bad. So the government gets to dictate moderation policies to every major website in America.

The way things are now, websites decide for themselves what moderation they want to use on their own website.

Maybe you don't like the status quo, but I'd really rather not replace it with something that seems more like something an authoritarian state would come up with.

&gt;But for social media companies that choose not to disclose their motives in advance, well they would not have that protection.

This is another crazy idea that just comes out of nowhere. What other businesses do we ever require to make similar fundamental and unchangeable decisions about basic aspects of how they operate? This has no basis, except maybe a desire to use the law to punish companies you dislike.",1590969795

"historyteachers","t5_2t7s5","My district evaluates us every year, problem is my evaluator is the not the same person as those who ""visit"" my class throughout the year. My visitors are usually in my class for less than minute and then walk out. They complained a lot about my teaching style because whenever they come in I'm always ""lecturing"" as my visitors have no idea what my curriculum is even about.  

I'm annoyed because these people only know what the standards say but don't know how to get each student how to understand those standards or how they're even connected. So if I mention something that isn't directly spelled out on the standard but is related to the material and can help bridge a gap in student knowledge, it's discouraged. 

Don't even get me started on the difference in teaching methods. If I don't teach like they did, then I'm not doing a good job. We teach in 90 minute classes and I break up each class into three 30 minute chunks but they never stick around to see anything within those chucks, only when I'm using my PPTs to give them a warmup, debrief the homework, post directions for assignments so they have a visual, or the sentence stems to guide their discussions. All they see is me talking in front of the board. 

At this point, I'm biding my time until I can move and try in a different state with less specific standards. If that doesn't work, I may leave teaching altogether.",1590969796

&gt; My fear is I’m seeing a lot of anger against police, not just the institution.

I do feel that the foundation of many of the protests is largely people disenfranchised with the institution, and by necessity, the representatives of that institution suppressing the rallies themselves are going to be a natural target. Personally, my viewpoint is that there is some blame to go around amongst individuals in general, but I think that the ""kill all pigs"" viewpoint is destructive and unproductive.

Believe that ""no other option"" should be amended to ""perceived no other option"", which can be linked to shortcomings of education in economically disenfranchised communities.  

Being led to believe that there is no other option is true embodiment of racism and oppression.  While I agree that situations throughout history have occurred where there is no there option, the United States is about as far from that as any civilization has ever been.  ""no other option"" is so dangerous that it deserves a lot of attention.  This narrative is meant to enslave people and further divide people.  Essentially placing a limitation on what some people's can accomplish is putrid.  It will be the undoing of rights causes throughout civilization and domestically as well.

Also we only care when they kill black people. Lots of white people get killed by police and no one cares. 

Again, to defend it, people always retreat to vague and impossible to disagree with generalizations. Yes, injustice is bad. But that is not what these are. These are mass violent reactions against police enforcing the law. The effect of them is that if a police officer kills a black criminal, even if it is justified (Michael Brown), cities burn, and law and order disappears. Cities before and after these events are changed. They become much more violent, much more lawless.

If one white kills an innocent black (Aubry or whatever his name is), same reaction. But if blacks kill hundreds of innocent whites, no one cares.

Why the discrepancy?

Why doesn't anyone speak out if any innocent white is murdered by a cop or a black, which happens all the time, but only loses their mind if it is the other way around, which is rare?

That indicates to me, all the claims about caring about ""police brutality"" or ""racist violence"" are bullshit. Selective outrage indicates bullshit.

But news outlet A and B said the OS is getting a redesign, and now we have iOS 14 and it looks identical to iOS 13” or “Well, I Still don’t see any widgets and I’m running iOS 14.1.3” If Apple Actually adds widgets, fantastic, if Apple actually gives iOS 14 a fresh coat of paint, great, I’m just not getting my hopes up for Anything until Apple shows iOS 14 officially.

Do you think the vast majority of black leaders have spent literally all of post-WWII American history urging against violence because they didn’t know about your super secret strategy of smashing shit?

No. They’re condemning violence because it *doesn’t work*. It does less than nothing. It only hurts residents of those communities. I hope you’re ready for those white anarchists to get mommy and daddy to post their bail, because the moment shit hits the fan they’ll abandon the black communities they were vandalizing to clean up the mess and take the blame. 

If violence is your strategy, I hope you’re ready for those white anarchists to turn tail and leave you to face the National Guard and the Marines without the support of either the American public, black leaders, or any institutional or financial backing. Sounds like a great plan, totally worth looting black grandma’s businesses for.

"legaladvicecanada","t5_3bcod","""they just made the receipt"".

I'm curious if you think there is some sort of official government receipt organization that certifies and numbers receipts in order to make them 'official'?

It sounds like your landlord is just some guy renting his basement.  What do you believe differentiates an official receipt (and what makes it official) and something ""just made""?

edit: an old boss of mine thought similarly when I needed to provide a child care receipt from some grandmother up the street.  I asked her the same question.",1590969802

And Woodley was the same level as he's always been, i think his skill plaetheued but he's still at the level he was as champ. The problem was Burns had an answer for eveything tryron could do. And tyron wouldn't take it to the ground cuz burns is a jits world champ. And Maia has only lost to championship level guys. Woodley, Covington, and Usman have all held belts and they all beat Maia. But they all beat Maia by playing it safe and costing to a decision, out of fear of Maias grappling. Burns said fuck that, defended his grappling, then knocked him out. Before that the last time Maia was tkod was 2009. I think Burns deserves the shot more then Edwards, but it prolly won't happen with all the shit happening in ww. So his next fight will prolly be against Edwards or Covington. And Edwards 100% needs one more win as his best victory has been RDA and thats not enough for a title shot.",1590969803

We all need help or attention sometimes and that's okay. Once my needs are met I'm no longer focused on meeting/squashing them, which frees me to think about others.

Continuing to tell myself I don't deserve this or that, or that I'm a selfish piece of garbage, is self-abuse. 

I also don't want to take the opportunity to help away from others. I accept it when I need it because I know helping feels good and it can make someone else feel good to be the helper.

During the success of Kind of Blue, Davis found himself involved with the law. On August 25, 1959, during a recording session at the Birdland nightclub in New York City for the US Armed Services, he took a break outside the club. As he was escorting a blonde-haired woman to a taxi, policeman Gerald Kilduff told him to ""move on."" Davis said that he was working at the club, and he refused to move. Kilduff arrested him and grabbed him as he tried to protect himself. Witnesses said the policeman punched Davis in the stomach with a nightstick without provocation. Two detectives held the crowd back, while a third approached Davis from behind and beat him in the head. Davis was taken to jail, charged for assaulting an officer, then taken to the hospital where he received five stitches. He was released on a $525 bail (US$4,605 in 2019 dollars). By January 1960, he was acquitted of disorderly conduct and third-degree assault. He later stated the incident ""changed my whole life and whole attitude again, made me feel bitter and cynical again when I was starting to feel good about the things that had changed in this country.""",1590969804

It was right by me! I immediately contacted them and they told me they had it! I immediately jumped in my car and drove 2hrs (heavy traffic should have taken me less on a normal day but I hit rush hour going home traffic) went in and say they had it pretty cool hole in the wall manga anime nerdy shop.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I can’t think of any times I’ve lost it without her starting it no, although I have got rough with my dog a couple of times while trying to train it not to pull on the leash and it repeatedly doesn’t learn, I tend to find I bite my lip and just lash out at it.  I’ve lost my temper with my kids and smacked their butts only a couple of times in their life which is more than I should have but never tried to damage or choke or anything that left a mark more than a few minutes, but I do understand that hot temper is hard to handle. When she was attacking yesterday it was for a good 10 minutes and I was getting worn out holding her back as she’s very strong and determined.  When she yanked my hair half out I very nearly lost it and slapped her again but I managed to hold it back, but yeah my scalp was sore for a long time so it’s probably a reaction. I was with previous partner 12 years and never hit that ex even once.
But in terms of my current partner, she got in a physical fight with her ex, and ended up bleeding etc.
The issue seems to be her mindset, if I say something she doesn’t like she gets angry then seems to think it’s ok to hit me and I deserve it.  I feel like if she could learn her feelings are her choice how to act it would be a lot better, but I also am at the point where I feel like she isn’t going to learn it, but I feel sorry for her as I truly care for her, and don’t like thinking she’ll be on her own.  I guess I feel a bit like I’m responsible for her like I am for my kids - they fight sometimes with each other (predates our relationship, not learned off her, and they fight more at my ex’s place), but I can teach them not to fight and they are getting the message, but it’s like harder with my partner as we are supposed to be equal but she’s younger and immature even for her age sometimes so I feel like I should help, but also that’s a boundary issue and she hates me lecturing her etc, which I take on board and try to learn not to do etc.
I don’t think it’s necessarily wrong of me to slap her in that situation as you say, but it’s mainly the escalation, the rolling pin, verbal threats she will kill me during the fight, trying to choke me, like it’s getting way out of hand now.  Like I remember we’d been dating a few months and one day she punched me in the head instead of the usual slaps and I had a talk to her about it, and it was fine for a long time, but also we’ve broken up a lot usually for a couple of days, almost always her idea in heat of the moment then she’d come back a few days later and we’d get together again.  It is a very physical relationship, lots of sex, like all day everyday, huge amounts of it, it’s something I put value on as touch is my love language, and even a fight doesn’t seem to put me off directly it’s more the tension building up I don’t like, after the fight it’s more of a release of emotions and I want to reconnect.

Nothing wrong with that, fuck whoever you please, but don't get pissed off just because you're only easy in specific scenarios and your friend didn't cater to your shallowness.

So while its a shitty thing to hear, the other person raises a valid point. The fact you're pissed off that he wasn't 'hot' makes you shallow and if your opinion of him would have entirely changed on appearance alone for you to want to sleep with him it would in fact, make you easy.

Again, if your type is a body shape, like 'Im into you based on how you look' that is the definition of easy, because for a buff person, you've not said you like a particular personality, or ambitions, or views, or goals or any of that. If you're willing to sleep with someone just because of how they look, that makes you easy, for that type of person.

Ultimately, it is up to me as a PI to safeguard participant PII^* , but there has been no mechanism for me to even request identifying info from the company. 

...

...

We used Poll Everywhere. I looked up how it works from their end, and it looks like it is impossible for a presenter or poll-administrator to determine participant identity (in general and in regards to specific answers to question). But, nowhere can I find information on whether Poll Everywhere can *themselves* record identities of respondents. 

At some level, there really is no way to do an anonymous poll that doesn’t rely on trust-based relationships. You have to trust the administrator (company, teacher, unit, etc.) and/or you have to trust the software developer. Otherwise, you’re back to filling out slips of paper while wearing latex gloves and placing them in a ballot box in a dark, cameraleas room...

So if they were to, say, in their own way, donate to meaningful charities with their patreon incomes, that would be more important than just saying things to say them on social media.

They can’t parse information and logically look at reality so they choose someone to do it for them and believe every word they say. This is not only willful ignorance, but they are almost always taken advantage of and used by their so called “heroes”, but they continue to stand by them. It doesn’t matter what they do, even if caught red handed. They will forgive their abusers and lash out at anyone trying to legitimately help them. Acknowledging their position would not only mean admitting they were wrong, which is way past their intellectual ability, but finding a new god to follow, and that’s too much work.

Even though I know they love me and they are good and kind people, they don't realize how they hurt me. This is something I think many parents, potentially most, don't handle well. You don't get to choose who your kid is and you should not have specific expectations for who they will be, what they like, etc. It's important to not just think you'll be okay with them turning out differently than you expect (ex: ""I'll be accepting if my kid turns out to be gay!""), but start from a place absent of assumptions. There is a difference between not assuming at all and saying you'll be okay if they turn out to be 'different'. I hope that makes sense, I'm not always the best at being articulate. 

For myself, discovering who my child is will be one of the most beautiful things I will ever get to witness and I am so incredibly excited. I agree with you, OP. I mostly just hope I can help them be a kind and thoughtful person. The rest will be wonderful discoveries.",1590969806

The presence / acceptability of surface noise is extremely subjective, as noted on the Discogs website. If OP’s stylus is not perfectly aligned, or if he’s playing a mono record without mono settings, this could cause surface noise. 

Perhaps that’s why the Discogs rating system, which is what OP is talking about, says “imperfections” instead of “surface noise.” They’re talking about whether the vinyl has defects, not whether a picky consumer hears minor noise when playing an inherently imperfect medium.

*****
&gt; From Los Angeles to Minneapolis to New York, what seemed like isolated attacks on the press at political rallies and protests over the last few years intensified as trust in media is near a decade low, some media experts said.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is an extremely scary place to be and not a place where journalists have felt since 1968 in this country,&amp;quot; said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, referring to journalists being harassed at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

&gt; &amp;quot;The numerous, targeted attacks that journalists reporting on protests across the country have faced from law enforcement over the last two nights are both reprehensible and clear violations of the First Amendment,&amp;quot; he said.

As technology improves more and more jobs can and will be automated away. Not just burger flipping as stated with Microsoft moving towards AI for journalism: https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/5/30/21275524/microsoft-news-msn-layoffs-artificial-intelligence-ai-replacements?__twitter_impression=true

In regards to $15/hr is mainly due to areas having different costs of living. If you live in a low income area where the cost of rent is $500 per month and most of the jobs pay less than $10 per hour then suddenly they all have to pay $15 an hour... Well a lot of jobs are probably going to go out of business, or maybe the cost of living would rise in those places also.

Just seems like $12/hr would be great in some areas and easier to implement then $15/hr everywhere and result in less jobs being lost.",1590969807

All stores should plan on opening at the regular time each morning. 24 hour locations should plan on opening at 8:00 AM local time. The SOC is aware of the curfew.

From what I've read most people seem to be down about $50 a month.  Is $50 really a hill you want to die on?  Plus even at 15-16$ an hour you're still making way more than minimum wage in a lot of places.

This is a gig job based on 6 month contracts.  The company owes us nothing. If you don't like the company then don't do the job.  As an employer,  if I knew an employee didn't want to work for me then I wouldn't offer to renew their contract.

And with the world economy right now is this really something you want to fight? So many people have lost their jobs.  Lots of people with real jobs have taken pay cuts (15-20% reduction in salary) so they can keep their jobs instead of the company laying off all of their staff. They're out WAY more than $50 a month.

The ones I stuck with are the ones who were able to create a safe space for me and engage well with a person who would barely speak. I would go back to the ones who showed an interest in the things I enjoyed and who could make me smile. I worked with the people who were able to guide me through times of heightened stress calmly and compassionately. 

I never cared much about qualifications, modalities or experience. Perhaps I should’ve. I definitely worked with a few people who were not adequately skilled to work with me.

Like the first two to three days of protesting which ended up with a Target, an Autozone, and a police station obliterated together with several other buildings.

*****
&gt; From Los Angeles to Minneapolis to New York, what seemed like isolated attacks on the press at political rallies and protests over the last few years intensified as trust in media is near a decade low, some media experts said.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is an extremely scary place to be and not a place where journalists have felt since 1968 in this country,&amp;quot; said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, referring to journalists being harassed at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

&gt; &amp;quot;The numerous, targeted attacks that journalists reporting on protests across the country have faced from law enforcement over the last two nights are both reprehensible and clear violations of the First Amendment,&amp;quot; he said.

"CompetitiveWoW","t5_35p2p","Conflict and Strife essences gives them access to the PvP talent ""Way of the Crane"" which increases the damage they do by 25% and causes all damage they do to heal 3 people in their party for 150% the amount. This allows the monk to DPS during big pulls and still be healing the group for absurd amounts. A Way of the Crane monk can heal a group through basically infinite bursting stacks if they're not refreshed. This talent scales much better the bigger you pull, so it's not completely broken how most of us do dungeons, but is amazing in how you do the MDI. Sort of like an unholy dk. Also monks bring excellent control with paralyze interupts, ring of peace and leg sweep. But the real reason is Way of the Crane + 5% physical damage buff.

Additionally meta classes in the MDI are hunters, warriors, and demon hunters. These all do substantial physical damage which monks buff. You don't take a windwalker, I don't know why but I assume they're just not as good. You don't take a brewmaster because Warriors are better for MDI style play. They have excellent mob control, they're pretty sturdy and they do the most AoE damage. If you need less damage, more control and something sturdier you take a demon hunter tank. 

So basically mistweavers fit into a niche of ""ridiculously broken in the mdi"" like unholy dk that doesn't translate completely to how the rest of us play the game. They're still really good but I think for pushing keys you ""want"" a druid.",1590969810

Basically just talk about any challenges you are having. How you think you are doing. Your manager will give you feedback about how they think you are doing, and what you can do better. Most places you have some kind of goals for performance and development for the year, so it wouldn't be uncommon to look at those and talk about what kind of progress you've made on them. 

If they don't give you feedback, just ask the question and ask what you could do to improve. Ask what types of things you should be doing to move up a position, if that's your goal.

I'm in more of a senior/lead type role, so we also talk a little about how the team is doing. Who works well together. I usually just keep that discussion pretty positive and try to put in a good word for anyone doing well that might be up for a promotion, so my manager can use it to help justify it.",1590969810

I understand that she hurt your feelings by saying that and that you blew up at her for annoying you. 
I'm not sure how extreme the situation was and if she was just teasing you a bit or if she really meant to hurt your feelings / make you feel bad.
But what I'm trying to say is it's okay for her to have preferences and refuse to sleep with someone she isn't attracted to anymore but it's also okay for you to be upset about this as 1) that's not something anyone would like to hear and 2) she was annoying you when you needed some rest.",1590969811

Honestly, I would assume that there *won't* be any choices that significantly alter the story length as people who then make those choices would have to reload or replay through possibly large chunks of gameplay, which isn't really ideal for those people playing casually.

If there were a hypothetical spot 20 hours along that shortens the story to 30 hours instead of 40 hours, that's a huge problem. Even going 40 to 39 is a problem. While you won't be able to experience everything possible in one playthrough, you accept that *that* is indeed the case.

"progressive","t5_2qlqk","Let's put it in perspective.  The majority of those protesting and marching for racial justice are not violent.  The ones who are engaging in riots/violence/setting fires/destroying property are either:

1. Anarchists who have tried to co opt the demonstrations for their own ends.  These are mostly white people who think that this is an excuse to escalate the situation and bring about the ""revolution"".  They are full of shit and selfish pricks.  And definitely not allies of African Americans fighting for racial justice.  They have a specific agenda and showed up with a plan to escalate things and make them worse.
2. Looters taking advantage of the lawlessness to loot

The thread is excellent. Some highlights: body cameras and implicit-bias training don't make police less aggressive. More restrictive use-of-force guidelines, demilitarization, more alternatives to police, and federal oversight all help.

*****
&gt; MINNEAPOLIS - Major U.S. cities feared another night of violent protests on Sunday over the death of George Floyd in police custody, cleaning up broken glass and burned out cars after curfews failed to stop confrontations between activists and law enforcement.

&gt; Mayor Bill de Blasio said police conduct was being investigated, including widely shared videos showing a police sports utility vehicle in Brooklyn lurching into a crowd of protesters who were pelting it with debris.

&gt; Philadelphia on Sunday moved the city&amp;#039;s curfew earlier, to 6 p.m. from 8 p.m. local time, and ordered all businesses to close as local TXF-TV showed images of groups of protesters attacking police cars, setting one on fire.

I’m female. I’d need to walk from here to Cashman Field which is about 14 miles or so away. I won’t make it there by tonight.

I don't think underfunding is an issue. The issue is where that money is being spent. Instead of spending it on training, psychological evaluations, and other things that will make our cops better at their jobs, they choose to spend it on tactical gear, military-level weaponry, and pointless shit like that. Some police forces are basically small militaries. Who are they at war with? The people they're supposed to serve and protect? That's sure how it feels sometimes. The other two things you mentioned are accurate. It's way too easy to get the job. Almost anyone can become a cop, and once you're part of the gang it's very unlikely that you'll ever get fired. They're all buddies and cover for each other when they do something wrong. Even when they murder people in public and it gets caught on video, it still takes a massive protest just to get the officers fired. And it took a massive riot just to get *one* of the officers arrested. The other three officers involved *still* haven't been arrested. It's crazy how much it takes to bring police officers to justice. They can basically get away with anything. And like you said, there is probably a cultural aspect to it as well. The way cops behave here is just so much different than any other country. The biggest culture shock of the UK is just how friendly and professional all the police officers are.

&gt; MINNEAPOLIS - Major U.S. cities feared another night of violent protests on Sunday over the death of George Floyd in police custody, cleaning up broken glass and burned out cars after curfews failed to stop confrontations between activists and law enforcement.

&gt; Mayor Bill de Blasio said police conduct was being investigated, including widely shared videos showing a police sports utility vehicle in Brooklyn lurching into a crowd of protesters who were pelting it with debris.

&gt; Philadelphia on Sunday moved the city&amp;#039;s curfew earlier, to 6 p.m. from 8 p.m. local time, and ordered all businesses to close as local TXF-TV showed images of groups of protesters attacking police cars, setting one on fire.

I swear to god I read this shit on a book.

So perhaps the 8 pointed star represents that there used to be 8 gods, but Khorne consumed 4 of them and claimed their domains.

Makes sense since Khorne is also the god of Honor, Martial Arts, Combat and Courage. And even goddamn Khaine somewhat of a minor aspect of Khorne, thus perhaps Khorne also gobbled up some Eldar entitites.

Another take on it is simply that 8-pointed star represents the nature of chaos, raw energy flowing outwards in all directions with no sense or purpose

They get decommissioned because they're normal babies and start to develop memories. The reason they can detect BTs which are just dead souls that don't make it to the beaches is because children are more sensitive to the beach. Some can even go there at will. 

Amilee is the beach version of Bridget Strand. The reason Bridges wants to extend the network is because it causes spikes in the cyral network which will in turn bring the world of the dead closer together with the real world allowing the next extinction event to take place.

&gt; MINNEAPOLIS - Major U.S. cities feared another night of violent protests on Sunday over the death of George Floyd in police custody, cleaning up broken glass and burned out cars after curfews failed to stop confrontations between activists and law enforcement.

&gt; Mayor Bill de Blasio said police conduct was being investigated, including widely shared videos showing a police sports utility vehicle in Brooklyn lurching into a crowd of protesters who were pelting it with debris.

&gt; Philadelphia on Sunday moved the city&amp;#039;s curfew earlier, to 6 p.m. from 8 p.m. local time, and ordered all businesses to close as local TXF-TV showed images of groups of protesters attacking police cars, setting one on fire.

But if you want to discuss this as if it were real... First of all, the dead body belonged to a man who abused Snape for years, up to and including publicly removing his underwear. Snape was entitled to spit on his body.

Second of all, distressed toddlers are not comforted by strange men grabbing them. Obviously, Snape didn't spend hours crying over Lily, and contacted Dumbledore, who sent Sirius. Which basically creates a bit of a contradiction, but none of this happened and the scene is shorthand for ""Snape was devastated by Lily's death"", so it doesn't really matter.",1590969824

No and if the trucker is making more the $30k a year (I'm not going to explain the 4 quarters bit), then he has to register and charge applicable GST or HST depending on province. 

So the taxes you charge is dependant on where the sale is made. So if the truck driver is driving to his customer in ON and the service was quoted $1000, it's $1000 plus HST because Ontario charges HST. If it was BC, it would be GST. Each province has different rates.

So for all the expenses, you can claim the HST or GST from those eligible expenses on your HST/GST return.",1590969825

Existential nihilism I think is different. Under the materialist paradigm, existential nihilism is rational, if you observe the world, and you are honest about how it is, there are real reasons to not wanting to engage with it: suffering, injustice, human evil, etc.

Then, if existential nihilism is valid as a personal philosophy, that's a different discussion, it depends on a lot of things.",1590969825

He hasn’t really been violent and has stayed clean since he got out of jail and it’s been about a year since then, but I don’t know if I will ever be able to trust him again. I always make sure that I have someone to drive by or I try to only allow him to watch her half the day and find someone pick her up if I can’t get off work. I also don’t tell him when I’m coming to pick her up exactly. I will tell him I’ll come between a window of 4p to 8p and say I “am not sure when I get off work” so he is always expecting me and on his best behavior. 

I also worry that he will get comfortable with his girlfriend, he says they want to move in together, and become abusive to her. He has been relatively isolated since he got out of jail, he says he stays alone to stay away from drugs and things that will make him go back to his past behavior, which has been how he has spent the last 10 years of his life.

“When you are a have and when you are a have-not, you see the world in very different ways. A lot of the time people say to the have-not's, ""This is not the right way to handle things."" When people marched through the streets of South Africa during apartheid, they said, ""This is not the right way to do things."" When people burn things, they say, “it's not the right..” It's never the right way because there's never a right way to protest! I've said this before, there is no right way to protest because that's what protest is. It cannot be right because you are protesting against a thing that is stopping you.”

“Fundamentally when you boil it down, society is a contract. It's a contract that we sign as human beings amongst each other. We sign a contract with each other as people, whether it's spoken or it's unspoken and we say, ""Amongst this group of us, we agree in common rules, common ideals, and common practices that are going to define us as a group."". As with most contracts, the contract is only as strong as the people who are abiding by it.
Some members of that society, namely Black American people, watch time and time again how the contract that they have signed with society is not being honored by the society that has forced them to sign it with them. When you see George Floyd on the ground, and you see a man losing his life in a way that no person should ever have to lose their life, in the hands of someone who is supposed  to enforce the law. What part of the contract is that? 


A lot of people say, ""Well what good does this do?"" Yeah, but what good doesn't it do? That's the question people don't ask the other way around. ""What good does it do to loot Target? How does it help you to loot Target?"" Because the only reason you didn't loot Target before is because you were upholding society's contract. **The reason we do that is because we understand in society, that if you lead by example, there is a good chance that people will follow that example that you have set. If the example law enforcement is setting is that they do not adhere to the laws, then why should the citizens of that society adhere to the laws when in fact the law enforcers themselves don't?**

There is no contract if law and people in power don't uphold their end of it. That's the thing I think people don't understand sometimes, is that we need people at the top to be the most accountable because they're the ones who are basically setting the tone and the tenor for everything that we do in society.”",1590969826

Im a 19f and I'm planning on moving out asap. I have fibromyalgia (look it up) CFS (look it up) PTSD and severe depression. My whole family is disabled somehow. 

This post is mainly aimed at my mother though. She has BPD (look it up) PTSD and alot more. She is not happy about me and my brother wanting to leave. She cries and throws tantrums when she is left alone so we can do other things. She yells at me for sleeping in past 10am when my stepdad doesnt get out of bed till past 2pm. She has a complicated emotional disorder which explains most of these actions. But she guilt trips us when we do something she doesnt like.

For the last 3 years I've been given 1k a month from the gov to live because of my crippling disabilities and my mum takes every penny. My mum forces me out of bed. She expects me to clean the whole house, cook food and pay her bills with all my money. My brother works from 5am till 2pm 5 days a week and she doesnt take all his money. I've had enough.

I know full well me moving out will leave them in financial trouble because she has told me so everytime that moving out comes up in conversation. She says that its ME that runs the house and I understand that. My mums physical health issues stop her from doing too much and my brother is at work. I'm not going there about my stepdad. He makes up for it for DIY and spider killing I guess. 

Anyway my mum has a SERIOUS gambling and shopping addiction and has so many catalogues that it's now destroying MY credit score because she has opened them in my name without asking. 

AITA for planning on moving out without telling them my new address and should I change the passwords on all catalogues in my account and attempt to pay them off to try and get my credit score back up???

* the black goat's name is Ibon. Ibon is also a constellation
* circle symbology (the Hole at the Center of Everything) is present all throughout the game, even on mae's shirt! though her shirt has a circle with a slash through it, possibly representing destroying/evading the Hole
* mae has prophetic visions exactly twice throughout the game. one is technically in an extra, but whatever. the first one is the extra game Longest Night, in which- despite being a dream- mae learns stuff she absolutely should not have a way to know timeline wise as that dream was had at college. the second prophetic vision was seeing the well that she climbs out of at the end of the game after harfest. if it's to be believed that Ibon is the source of these dreams, it knew its own fate. if Mae's the source of the dreams, she's a prophet. anything else causing the dreams just means that Mae *really* needs to stop delving into the occult.
*  there is a cut bit of dialogue with gregg where mae mentions the fact that witchdagger - her favorite doom metal band - has a song about a *well* (see: mae's well dream, and the fact the gang climbs out of the same well from her dreams after the mine incident) and some of the lyrics to the song are ""Deep cold, darkest hole in the center of everything"" and like. hole at the center of everything? sure do wonder where i've heard that name before! also mae after that can mention her well dream, or the fact that now it reminds her of falling into a hole and being unable to get out.
* the song Space Dragon is almost definitely inspired by the doom metal song Dragonaut by SLEEP
* lots of cough syrup contains DXT (Dextromethorphan), which is a dissociative drug. considering mae almost definitely has a dissociative disorder (probably DPDR), the cough syrup - while it did make her knock herself out - also likely worsened her dissociative episodes or increased their frequency.
* mae might have some sort of eating disorder, evidenced by the fact that she seemed to binge eat at college (""Mae: I either didn't eat or I ate entire pizzas at once"") and hardly eats throughout the course of the game (although that can be chocked up to not having proper places to put her eating). if that is the case, that makes the weight options at the mirror much worse since she blames it on *eating too much*, which is definitely not the problem in that case! (worth noting that, yeah, binge eating like that will cause weight gain, i'm pretty sure. i'm not scientist, but i think it makes your body store up fat because it doesn't know when the next time you'll will be, and it needs that fat incase you starve it for a while).

I don't even feel a want for unrelated people to get hurt if someone hurts me, that's so narcissistic is unbelievable. The fact that you even want that, dispite thinking that's a reasonable thing to want, really makes me not respect you. It should be obvious that if someone hurt you it's not ok to take harm random other people in ""response"". I guarantee if someone close to me was killed by the cops I wouldn't feel justified breaking into a random persons house, burning down unrelated buildings, stealing from an unrelated stores, or trashing random peoples cars. The fact that you do is actually really concerning.   
    
What about all the real damage that's caused by the riots? Why do you think that it's just something you can say ""meh"" to, and handwave away. What about the unfinished apartment complex that was burned in these riots. How was that even justified? Even if you genuinely don't care about anybody who looses money from that, there's a housing shortage going on. Are you going to even consider viewing the riots as worsening that problem? Why do you think that an uncontrolled riot destroying random peoples property only effects people who deserve it?

I completely understand those that don't like him though, he can be annoying if his dialogue isn't your thing, but I understand why others like him too with his quirky personality.

He, along with other underused characters (darvo, clem, maroo, tensin) need to have additional dialogue and be used in missions.

Maroo for Excavation

Tensin for anything Kuva related (since we're buddies with him since TWW, not including PvP)

You won't remember stuff unless you practice it. I learned Linux in school and didn't use it, then got into the field and had to relearn some of it. The theory, should, in theory, stick. But unless you're practicing the languages you've learned you won't be proficient at using them, and you won't get better at them without practice.

The same goes for any software or command line or whatever you've learned. If you don't use it, you lose it. 

The last thing I have to say here is that in some cases, you retain more than you think you have. I walked out of community college with my AAS and was convinced I didn't know a damn thing, especially after a few interviews.

"CableManagement","t5_2tdv7","I would suggest placing the CPU AIO infront of the case as an intake radiator. As the radiator can only cool the water from cold air. And the GPU looks to be an open style cooler card. GPUs also tend to run hotter in most gaming applications as games tend to be more GPU bound than CPU. So if the GPU gets to even 70C, then the radiator is being cooled with air temperature that ranges from ambient to 70C air. If the radiator were infront of the case, then  the CPU will be cooled by ambient air which is normally less than 26.7C or 80F. Even at 100F that will be 37.8C

Unless you are already seeing temperatures that are under 80C for the CPU and are not concerned with the CPU thermal temperatures under both GPU and CPU loads.

&gt; MOSCOW - The Russian Embassy in the United States sent a note of protest on Sunday to the Department of State after a Minneapolis police officer pepper-sprayed RIA Novosti reporter Mikhail Turgiyev in the face.

&gt; &amp;quot;A note of protest has been sent to the State Department over this revolting incident. We demanded that they conduct a thorough investigation and inform us about its results&amp;quot;, Ambassador Anatoly Antonov said in a statement to the press.

&gt; The Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier it was concerned about increasing police brutality and unjustified arrests of journalists covering protests that broke out in the United States after the death of black man George Floyd.

It was sorta like Smash Bros (the party game version), but 3D and with health bars.

Items would spawn and there was a whole unlock/progression game to unlocking new items to play with using a shop and combining items in a furnace.

Stages had hazards and transformations. There was an adventure mode which was similar to Smash's Arcade mode: a series of fights broken up occasionally by special levels.

Also from the Dreamcast Era: the [Jet Set Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yC3K8sMwWU&amp;t=8s) games.

I was so happy when that came to steam and on replaying it recently it still holds up really well.

It's sort of like Need for Speed meets Tony Hawk: your goal is to dodge police while roller-blading around the city tagging locations with graffiti. The police got increasingly silly going to riot squadrons, attack dogs, and even tanks and attack helicopters.

Unlike Tony Hawk the emphasis isn't on performing tricks, it's about grinding, wall riding, and more to avoid cops and reach tag spots.",1590969836

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Some of my favorite games are RPGs like Morrowind and The Outer Worlds. These games have volumes and volumes of dialogue and worldbuilding to the point where if you read every single thing you came across, you could probably classify the work as a ""book game."" But the fact is that I can skim or completely ignore these texts if I'm in the mood for more action and less lore. It doesn't diminish my experience to do so. 

In games like Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid, you can do the same thing by skipping through cutscenes and dialogue and just playing the level. But does doing so diminish the experience? This probably varies from person to person, just like my Morrowind example will, and I think this is why some people don't have the patience for ""cinematic games"" while others simply consider cinematics one facet of an action/adventure experience.",1590969836

"resinkits","t5_2zwa6","Non skin area? I would put some masking tape over the skin and non skin area without pressing it and then use like a blunt tooth pick and try and press the tape into the grooves. The reason you don't press the tape right away is you want the tape to be able to shift into place as you run the tooth pick into the grooves.  Then get a blunter object like the back of a paint brush that is rounded rub the tape down so it's all stuck to the surface.  Once you done that, you get a sharp blade and carefully cut along the groove, the sharper the better as it will glide and cut the tape better. 


Though my rule of thumb when it comes to masking is to always paint the ""lower"" parts first and the raised up areas after, the reason:  when masking raised up areas the masking tape sometimes would not stick to the edge of the raised area so that vertical part as tiny as it may be can sometimes get paint on it or the air blasting can lift the tape a bit.  It's ""safer"" to mask low areas since the tape can't get lifted and you can paint the lip of raised areas cleanly.  Also you can kinda butt the tape right up against the raised area to get a natural place to mask.",1590969837

"insanepeoplefacebook","t5_3acf2","The strangest thing is. Today I had a first person view of this stupidity at work today. I work in a small retail store. A customer walks in and see another moving a metre away from him. 

Then he proceeds to start educating her on how all this corona is bullshit and all the death are caused by 5G. He says that with the 5G, they are launching thousands of satellites into space which apparently can detect/identify us human by using the electricity with our body. The standing 2m apart was so if people stick together more, it’ll interfere with the signals. 

Then says that corona is a small virus but it’s used as an excuse by the government because of organs failure caused by the 5G signals. Then said it’s to do with some IA (AI in normal terms) shit. 

He also said that the queen is stepping down and a new king, a guy who allows all this to happen and supports will be taking her place. 

The crazy thing is, the other woman actually believed him. I had to put on my straight face to stop myself from laughing.",1590969838

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","There are no numbers on ""the number of violent crimes committed by representatives of each race"" (whatever that means). But there are or should be numbers on police encounters, arrests, etc. But *a large part of the problem* is that black people and black neighborhoods are policed more heavily than white people and white neighborhoods. *This very well could skew the numbers*. How many white people get confronted, arrested, or *murdered* by police for walking down the street, carrying a toy gun in a park because their a kid, writing a bad check, selling cigarettes on the street? Fuck, how about just answering the door to your own home when the cops show up at the wrong house?

So, we can both agree that China has wildly misreported their numbers. Problem is, the US numbers are nowhere near accurate as well, and are likely vastly under reported. In the beginning, unless you were a senator, basketball team, or wealthy,  too bad, no test. If everyone were tested who had symptoms in the US I bet the numbers would be vastly increased. 

You are absolutely correct that healthcare professionals have been incorrect here and there concerning NOVEL Corona virus. That said, a few mistakes here and there are no good reason to reopen a country still under the grips of a pandemic. It's irresponsible, and screams dollars over lives. Btw, Twitter as a source for medical info is just.....bad. 

Your point on accusing all protesters as looters, I concede.  A frustrated populace victim of systemic racism,  class warfare, police brutality, and a stacked justice system is going to snap eventually. It looks like this.

the weapon of choice is completely irrelevant. This video is a blatant display of tyranny.

armed soldiers are marching through the private, peaceful residential neighborhoods, screaming ""stay inside!"". they are intimidating and threatening people. they are shooting at peaceful people who are standing on their front porch.

Holy crap why do people do this every time that a female character or woman irl is well-endowed &lt;\_&lt;?  
Especially with wearing a corset, she's just well-endowed she doesn't look like she's on the Sorceress in Dragon's Crown levels. Even so, there are women in real life that actually do have that size too and are totally natural...  
But at least I could somewhat understand saying '' comically large '' because it's such an extreme rarity.  
I don't think that it's a good thing to say either way tho and I do think that it's a bit shamey. In Dragon's Crown it's moreso the animations that are animated in a bit of a comedic way.  


But the character in question is really just well-endowed and that's it.  
It'd be cool if we could just for once see a female character or a woman who is well-endowed be represented without people obsessing about it or shaming her for it. You know, just treat her like a person the same way you'd treat a smaller-chested woman like a person too.

There wasn't a problem between the protestors and the police department.

Note that I live far from the mall but close to one of the fire stations and haven't heard any unusual activity.

EDIT: I would rely on the multiple different-angle shots taken by wcia. The imgur post is... I don't know what that is, but I don't believe it's here. I don't remember that billboard, for one. That looks like a much bigger city.

Note that black community leaders were on scene to stand in front of the business and decry the looting. No fighting with the police occurred. I didn't see any estimates of the number of looters and the only footage I saw showed about five people running into the mall building.

I get anxiety when talking to new people, or talking to friends I don't have much in common with. I never go outside, because again, I'm quite an anxious person, and my friends would always come round my house to get me, and I'd have to say no each and every time. 

Now, however, no one's asking me to hang out, and no one's texting me 24/7. It's really freeing.

Obviously it's a tragedy that so many lives have been lost, and in no way is covid-19 a pleasant thing. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I just enjoy the time to myself, as I've just been sleeping most days without worrying about having to get up and get dressed for school etc. I no longer have to face people for the next few months.

I'm mixed race (dad's black, mom's white) and grew up in the South.  American history education in the 90's -2000's school system was a mixed bag.  The horrors of the middle passage and slavery were touched upon, Jim Crow less so.  To Kill a Mockingbird was assigned reading in elementary, middle, and high school.  At the same time, I remember my high school US History teacher floating the idea that the Civil War was about state's rights not slavery, which is an argument you hear a lot from whites in the South.  Also we were  implicitly taught that after Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement all our racial problems were solved lol.  And we certainly never visited a slave plantation when we were in school.  Our current racial problems stem, in large part, from our failure to acknowledge our past mistakes and the fact that the consequences of those mistakes are still with us.",1590969841

What started out between friends across a couple of cities, we continue to provide a space every week for improvisers from across the world to play and learn from each other, especially those who haven’t had a theater or troupe to play with due to the quarantine. We’re also excited that we’re featuring our first team outside the United States: friends of the jam from Toronto Canada! Join us this Sunday and play in the jam!

Start time is 9pm Eastern, 8pm Central, 7pm Mountain, 6pm Pacific.
Featured troupe this week: Youu Name It of Toronto, Ontario, Canada!

Event Link:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/7167021992
Meeting ID: 716 702 1992

The link will be active an hour before start time, so if anyone wants to chat and meet each other can do so, as well as address any technical issues people may have. We will also live-stream the event on Facebook in this event and around the Facebook improv community.

***REGISTRATION to play will be 5:30pm to 6:00pm Pacific, beginning at half an hour before the start event. Anyone who arrives after start time will be flagged, and we cannot guarantee a spot for you to play due to the number of people to play. That being said, we still strive to include as many people as possible. If you have played with us in the past, you may be asked to sit out to allow a new player to play, thank you for being a good neighbor. Lastly, PLEASE DO NOT JUST SHOW UP RIGHT AT START TIME. Help us out by planning to arrive earlier so we can make sure you get registered. This determines the number of jam teams and playing time.***

At the beginning, we’ll run a crash course on how to play with the Zoom program, then we’ll organize teams and play! The general run time will be 2 hours, but we’ll keep open as long as people want to play. We will have Musical Improv specific jam teams this week due to popular demand!

I purchased an [Ion TTUSB](https://www.ionaudio.com/ttusb-bionttusbx110) some years back and due to a laundry list of reasons have never used it. Recently was gifted an AT-LP60X and I am now in the position to start playing the limited vinyl I have and begin to expand on my collection.

Lurking around the forums enough, I know that saving for an upgrade on my Turntable itself the best way to start getting deeper in to the hobby, but until I purchase a new one, which Turntable, I currently have is the better to use sound quality wise?

If it makes any difference, I will be running the Turntable through our [Onkyo TX-NR636](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/onkyo-tx-nr636-review/) and whatever speakers were installed in our Home Theater Package when we purchased the home. I do plan on purchasing some powered Speakers down the line, but I digress.

Maybe I should sell them both, as the LP60 is still in box and the Ion is unused and search for something on Craigslist or FB Market Place. I live in Las Vegas, NV, if anyone can see if this would be a better direction to go.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1590969842

In the days after his death, Black Lives Matter activists rallied to protest the killing of Baker, who was biracial, a light-skinned man with pale blue eyes.""

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","&gt;You've made it clear you don't think it should be universal. Therefore, by definition, some people will not be able to access it

I don't think everyone should be forced to use the same, government-run provider. I think that if you want to pursue private insurance, or if you prefer direct primary care, or if you want to cross the border and get your health care in Mexico, you should be free to do so. If you choose, of your own free will, to live without health insurance, if there are other things you want to spend your money on, that's your right. That is not even remotely the same thing as claiming that not everyone should have access to health care.

Unlike Confederates, who explicitly said they were fighting for slavery (despite the bogus “state’s rights” argument dreamed up years after the end of the Civil War), the Texan revolutionaries were more interested in local autonomy, including the right to bear arms, English being a legal language, trials by jury, and free trade with other countries, Crisp said.'''

From the article you posted. If you want to write off a defining moment in history for our local heritage because it wasn't perfect by modern-day standards that is flat out dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

however, 'yin' is characterized by being sot of slow, soft, yielding, cold, and passive, as well as like darkness and the moon and female: this is the 'black' part which has jeannie in it

and the 'yang' is characterized with fast, firm, hard, hot and active, as well as light and 'male', and that's what henry's representing (there's other dualistic aspects but can't recall what the fuck they are off the top)

&amp;#x200B;

so tbh i feel like it's fitting really - and it's not so much like the 'good in the bad' or the 'bad in the good' even if it was a moral divide - rather the circles within the sides sort of represents that things aren't purely divided or anything there's 'representation' i guess in the majority of one aspect, of another aspect",1590969843

However it doesn’t change my underlying point of generalized as well.  The fundamental problem with inconveniencing and violence is that it requires some minimum threshold of mobilized supporters as a percentage of the population that it seeks to inconvenience as well as not impacting a disproportionate amount of those who are uninvolved.

So for instance in the case of a bus boycott or any boycott in general.  True, it involves inconveniencing some group.  But it’s largely inconveniencing the group responsible for whatever needs to be change while not inconveniencing other groups who aren’t involved.  Same with the tea party, same with the overwhelming majority of successful inconvenience/violence campaigns.

They were able to apply enough pressure long enough to the correct group of people to affect change.

But in this case, when you block the freeway.
A. You aren’t inconveniencing a great enough percentage of people for a long enough period of time to begin with
B. You are inconveniencing people who largely aren’t the source of the problem
C. You are inconveniencing people who largely don’t have the power to directly do anything even if they were the cause

Combine those and you get diminishing support for whatever your cause is.

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","I personally think we should get the witch as a killer. Her power could be based off the Wandering Witches from L4D2 in which while holding m2, she covers her face reducing visibility and movement speed but increases her terror radius. This should not have a cool down or activation time etc or she'd be weak af. If a survivor fails a skill check or performs a rushed action within the terror radius, killer instinct activates and the witch gets an increased movement speed of ~5-10% until the aggravating survivor is downed or another aggros her. 

Maybe give her a passive too that if she is flashlight blinded she enters a rage mode that increases pallet destruction and vault speeds by 15% for about 30 seconds, finally have a killer who can use flashlights as an advantage.

&gt; In order to destabilize the economy, we will carve on as many gold pieces as possible, almost invisible to the naked eye. In 1d4+1 years time, the gold piece on which it is scribed will cast the fireball spell. In theory, this will kill the rich and destroy the public image of banks. So, we're going to need an army.
 Let's assemble thousands of willing subjects to have the Gaseous Form spell cast upon them. Then they will assume the role of spying clouds and fog.
 Then, no one will see this coming: A person in a position of great power (choose or roll 1d4: 1. King/Queen 2. Chosen one 3. Demigod 4. Hero of the lands) secretly begins working for us.
 That's when the plan officially takes root.    A deity has seen our plans and sees its merit, albeit in a twisted way to further their own.
 For insult to injury, I will reveal my true self.
 Right before the end, someone close to our enemies will Turn Against them.

and 

&gt; In order to banish a deity/pantheon from the realm entirely, we're going to need an army.
 Let's call on the Old Masters to create a formidable force for us.
 Then, no one will see this coming: We cause some odd and unexplainable events, including spells calling out a specific name when cast, weapons cracking in the shape of a specific sigil, and the words in books rearranging.
 That's when the plan officially takes root. As chaos tears parts of the world asunder, the leaders of those lands seek our aid.
 For insult to injury, after deliberation, a select few prisons release particularly powerful prisoners to fight in favor of survival, only to scatter once released.

Overall, ***for me only***, I found that I liked grandmarc more than highlander north in terms of experience. Again it's my own personal preference and opinion. I know people who stay at highlander north for 2-3 years and the same for grandmarc.

"asklatinamerica","t5_fda8k","It's only football related, but the thing is, I actually know a lot of people who take it very seriously. In 2014 World Cup I got to watch Argentina vs. Switzerland for the round-of-16 and I saw at least 5 different fights happening between Argentineans and Brazilians in the stadium. In reality, we're the most disrespectful between the two. Also, for the semi-finals between Argentina and Netherlands, I watched the game in a bar outside the stadium full with Argentineans and there were more fights.

To be honest, I also know more people who don't like Argentineans claiming that they're arrogant, but of course that comes with football stuff. Usually when a Brazilian team plays another one in the Libertadores, majority of people go for the Brazilian team. I 100% want all other Brazilian teams to fuck themselves so I choose the Argentinean teams instead, but that's a characteristic of the general fans of my favorite football club.

What I found by talking with other Argentineans that I met is that we ""hate"" them much more than they hate us, and I think that's really stupid. If we play against Argentina I obviously want Brazil to fuck them up in the game, but I do admire Argentinean football and Argentinean players a lot, and I really admire Argentinean people.

To conclude: Brazilians hate Argentina in football more than the other way around, and sometimes it goes beyond what happens in the field. I have always paid attention to stuff like that as I really admire our hermanos from the South.",1590969846

I wonder if your accountant is just having a hard time articulating that you each get 25% and not you each get 50%. Regardless, you already got good advice here and I think you properly understand your situation.

I agree with u/angelous97 about 50% being aggressive. The problem you could run into is that, if CRA reviews your return, they can take the position that the income producing nature of house is not ancillary to personal use portion, which may put you offside of fully using the principal residence exemption on your house. I would really consider and re-measure to see if maybe you're closer to 45% than 50%.",1590969847

"brasilivre","t5_351wl","&gt;Na minha visão, mesmo que separatismo não seja permitido pela constituição, essa é a saída que nos fará ter paz no curto e longo prazo. Enfim, qual a sua opinião sobre o separatismo no Brasil? Se é a favor, como faríamos?

Descreva como essa paz vai funcionar.

Cada região é depende da outra se isolar cada uma ninguém consegue competir no mercado mundial sem ser dominado pela China.

Isso sem contar que os problemas não somem só por você salário o país ao meio, e igual a jogar todos os equipamentos quebrados no terreno vizinho a achar que agora vai.

Isso sem contar  em um detalhe importante e polêmico, 

Aonde vai ser a nova capital e porque?

E os outros estados vão aceitar isso porque? 

Qual vai se o novo sistema político? 

Vai ser esse por que? 

Os outros países não vão querer anexação de territórios perdidos no passado por qual motivo mesmo?

Te garanto que não vai ter paz nem em curta, nem a longo prazo, só vai mudar os problemas.

By which I mean, from what I can tell, Apple changed how it works as a ""feature"", which left more people frustrated than anything else.

Back in iOS12, yes, it absolutely worked (at least for me) that each new detection would restart the timer.  Now it doesn't.

In addition, the ""turn off"" actually seems to revert to the last state.  I have a door with a door sensor that controls lights.  In iOS12, this meant that I could open the door, lights come on with no off timer, close the door, lights ""turn on"" with a five-minute off-timer, so turn off after 5 minutes. In iOS13, the lights never turn off again, because they revert to the last state instead, which was ""on"".  IE, door opens, lights turn on with no off timer.  Door closes, lights ""turn on"" again with a 5 minute timer.  At the end of that 5 minute timer, the lights ""turn off"" by reverting to their last state, which was ""on"" from when the door opened.

I've raised feedback about it with Apple, but still no fix or response.",1590969848

I haven't opened up to anyone except for a few girlfriends I had, so confronting a family member felt impossible. However, once I told her, I asked her not to say anything, and she totally understood. She didn't mind it at all and even said she liked having her feet touched, and she's really glad I was the one touching her feet because we're family.

Evil exists in the universe, and not all evil can be reasoned with without assertive action. There is a reason human resolve exists. There is a reason we are so good at war. There is a reason we so firmly believe in peace.

Because peace and progress, are worth fighting for.

*Fighting* for.

If we continue to believe that voting and protesting will lead to lasting change, we are conceding to complacency. More of this will happen down the line, and the cycle will rinse and repeat.

Sometimes, you have to fight. That’s just the nature of our existence. Some things *have* to be destroyed, in order for progress to be made.

In this case, we destroy the broken system and its benefactors who are so desperately trying to cling to the aging system of conservatism and greed. 

We can’t vote them out. They’ve corrupted the system to where our voices mean nothing.
