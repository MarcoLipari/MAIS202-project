This isn't an opinion, it happens and has happened.  The courts prosecute criminals under hate crime legislation when any race-- including whites-- are violently targeted because of their ethnicity.

I agree with this so much, I think this is one of the strangest things to me. Like, suppose you're Adnan and you're completely innocent, you literally had nothing to do with this whatsoever. Then some dude you sort of know fingers you in this incredibly elaborate story about your ex-gf's death, AND knows specific details about the crime (i.e. where to find her car) - what conclusion could you possibly draw except that Jay killed her? I really don't think that's a leap, but he never even suggests it.

This is why I think that even if Adnan didn't do it, he knows exactly what happened and for some reason doesn't want to say. I proposed somewhere upthread that there's some other criminal element that Adnan and Jay are both involved with, maybe a gang or a more serious drug ring or something (which would also explain why they seem to be closer than either of them wants to admit).","1414800004"

-many sentences are discretionary, this can vary by a LARGE amount.

-a ""crime"" is not always the same, even if some of the circumstances are the same. A prosecutor can offer to charge you with a lower degree of murder or manslaughter, for example. This benefits the accused as well as the prosecutor; there's a chance that the accused may serve NO time of the prosecutor cannot prove all the elements of the crime. This ensures criminals are off the streets for at least SOME time.

-As much as you may brush it off... it's a very expensive process.  Assuming you are american, I'm guessing you would also like lower taxes, if possible.

-It is a system that gets someone jailed for an extremely lengthy sentence for something the legislature never intended it be... you have a right to fight these accusations, but that right is essentially destroyed when your options are to accept a sentence (for a crime you didn't commit) or fight it with the possibility of a ridiculously long sentence

-not all crimes have mandatory sentences

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You can't sell a non-personalised plate - so you can't sell H982 FKL, but you can sell H1VAE.

Every UK car gets a non-personalised registration number - in this case it is H982 FKL. This remains with the car forever. 

If you buy a personalised registration (like a ""vanity plate"" in the US), either from the government or from someone else (they're transferrable like that), then you can have that number put onto any car you own. In that case, the registration number is changed to the personalised number but the old one is still recorded.

If you then decide to transfer the number to another car (eg you're selling it) then the government reactivates the old number to free up the personalised number.

Non-personalised registration numbers don't change when you sell the car, it's not like the US where you may be required to get new plates. Personalised plates can be sold with the car but many people like to keep them and transfer them onto their new car (or sell it separately, good numbers sell for megabucks at auctions and privately)","1414800005"

Each kilogram of mass that goes to Mars ultimately has to first be launched to LEO, which is the largest delta-V in the entire mission. Delta-V costs fuel.

Yes, it is true that traveling from LEO to Mars takes less fuel than to travel from Earth's surface to LEO. That should be pretty obvious. But you can't say ""oh we're using less fuel because we launched from space"" when you have to launch all that fuel into LEO in the first place - each stage of the mission doesn't happen in a vacuum. Each extra kilogram that ultimately goes to Mars represents an exponential increase in fuel at every stage back to the launch pad on Earth.","1414800008"

I'd presented it to governments, hospitals, multi-nationals and the key take-out I got was automation of the workforce because it lets you see all the steps that humans do with the systems they use. As a convo topic, it's great with those who are in management and administration because it helps their world, but I never talk about it in social settings, I'd made a different system for that.  
I guess one of the most effective convo topics started by me asking what their hobbies were, and going deeper into how they use that enjoyment to do their daily work. One lady loved jigsaw puzzles (be husband hated them), but she enjoyed piecing all the parts together to make the picture. I linked that to her job as an accountant (which she hated) and she found a whole new way to look at it. She called me up a week later and said she now looks at her work as parts of the corporate puzzle, and now putting the corporate pieces together is fun for her, she has found she likes her job more.","1414800009"

I had a bulk 2 lb bag of pistachios, a bunch of DVDs and PC games, some hard candy, regular gum and nicotine gum.

I basically detoxed myself for 4 days.. it was a long weekend and I didn't have to go to work.

Every time I got a craving, I'd eat some pistachios.  Which, just like having a meal, made me want a cigarette even more.  I would just recognize the cravings when they happened and mentally keep track of how long them would take to pass.  Sometimes they were so intense I felt like my body was practically shaking.

I chewed the nicotine gum whenever I felt like like I was doing well, not when I was having cravings, since I didn't want to reward those feelings.

By the end of those four days, I was ninety percent better.  I went back to work, brought more gum and pistachios with me and was able to control my cravings.  I didn't have any serious impulses to go buy a pack.

"science","t5_mouw","Yah, California &amp; Arizona are both the biggest consuming culprits &amp; most dependent states. 

**California**: Most of the public assumes that California has plenty of freshwater on it's own, but this is entirely not the case. California has very little freshwater, and has been dipping into the Colorado River's ""surplus"" since the beginning of the compacts creation in order to satisfy its increasing population. I'll take this time to mention that between 1905-1922 (when the scientists were analyzing the river &amp; setting the allocation conditions) the river was at a period of ""abnormally high rainfall"". Couple that with incorrect measuring &amp; data analyses and you get a recipe for disaster... or inevitable drought.

**Arizona**: I love living in Arizona, but society really wasn't meant to set-up camp in the lower portions of the state. Southern cities rely on canal systems (like the CAP that I mentioned in the original comment) to deliver the reserved water to their region. Without being able to transfer this reservoir water millions of people would be forced to live in exactly what southern Arizona naturally is... a desert. ","1414800017"

Well of course it made no sense to you, *how could wonderful, flawless Ami ever act in a way that wasn't perfect?*

(but really I'm just poking fun because we went from ""Urawa never calls her! Oh wait that's in character"" to ""Ami never calls him! Oh obviously all this stuff happened offscreen"", your explanation was actually perfectly reasonable)

&gt;Portmanteaus are the only avenue available 

But... it was a portmanteau? Just with their surnames because I didn't like Amako. Although I appended Maru because I looked up a more appropriate affix than S.S. for a Japanese ship, but then I *forgot to delete S.S.* Whoops.

&gt;They just take things, because regardless of how they feel about the humans in relation to themselves, they also feel perfectly content in doing that and not seeing the harm.

Thing is, I was mostly just joking about it in last week's thread, but they've been thwarted by the senshi a couple times now and never seem to even consider that maybe the direct approach isn't working so well. After all, they keep reminding us that their lives are on the line, so it seems odd that we're required to mostly infer their pigheadedness. I don't mind your interpretation but I want more from the aliens that is *alien*. Admittedly, later in the episode we did actually get some of that, what with the ""Love is something you take by force"", so if we get more of that sort of material I'll probably stop grumbling. 

&gt;Am I sensing a spin-off to Pose Critics?

Maybe? We kinda don't get to see them in their civvies all that often so it would need to be an intermittent event. And Rei would always win.

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","TL.DR: Big wall of text that I'm really not capable of shortening :P read at own will.

I could start off with some comments on the list:
- The overlord is OK, you really should get him a Warscythe as it really is one of the better melee weapons in the game. For an Overlord that's probably going in an infantry unit the rest of the kit is good (see below for the more popular build for the overlord recently). 
- The Troops are good, I personally love Tesla Immortals, but you should consider Gauss if you are expecitng tanks. 
- 2 Barges, perfect, just about the best unit we have in our codex right now.
- As for the rest of your points, you are at 845 now, get the warscythe on your lord and then for the rest of the points up to 1k I would get rid of the ress orb, give the overlord a phase shifter and a command barge. The Overlord in catacomb command barge is one of the most popular things for Necrons since 7th came, because it is a beast! fly it over anything and crush them with sweeping attacks, he can take down multiple vehicles himself over the course of a game this way. Phase Shifter and MSS makes him really hard to kill also. The last points i would put into a cryptek, either a harbinger of storm or destruction would be good here.

As for other general Necron tips (won't comment the same units again here):
Ignore the named characters, the generic overlord and destroyer lord do the same jobs better and cheaper. The Destroyer lord is awesome, specially together with wraiths (re-roll those ones). Most crypteks are great, they are cheap and provide lots of utility (Destruction for MC's, Storm for vehicles, Despair for deathmark cheese). Lords are ok, but a bit expensive, but at higher points they are better than overlords at giving ress orbs and warscythes to units.

C'tan shards are to expensive and fragile, Deathmarks are a solid unit, Flayed ones is our worst unit in the codex, Lychguard and Praetorians are way too expensive. Scarabs are great, even better with some Spyders. Wraiths are one of our best units. Tomb Blades and Destroyers are expensive with bad guns. Doom scythe is OK, but a bit expensive and you are much better off with Night scythes (which are awesome!). Doomsday ark will blow up way too fast. And the Monolith is expensive with not much value.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Allow me to try and illustrate. My brother-in-laws' parents died when he was 6 in a car accident. After being shuffled around a couple of foster himes, he was eventually placed into an catholic-run orphanage, and was sexually abused repeatedly by a number of the catholic staff (almost entirely priests). Over the next 9 years he was relocated to a number of different facilities all over the country - and received sexual abuse at all but one. He is now a witness in the [Australian equivalent of a Supreme Court Inquiry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_Institutional_Responses_to_Child_Sexual_Abuse) into institutionalised sexual abuse in church operated organisations.

However, does his experience trump yours? He can quite correctly state that *in his experience* that majority of catholics he has ever known were active child molesters. Does that make it true? Experience only assists in giving us a framework from which to judge the validity of new information - dismissing *new* information based on *previous experience only* is a dangerous practice. You *assume* he's talking out of his ass - based SOLELY on the fact that you disagree, nothing more. He even provided a citation for his assertion - the statement from the Catholic church themselves, whereas you have merely provided one person's interpretation of your personal and unique experience.

The problem with this is that TCAS was not as advanced back then as it is now. TCAS now most certainly could have prevented this accident from occuring, and would have gave warnings at least 500 feet away if not more. The real issue is that these pilots are tasked with so much, that even with a 500 feet warning, he could have not had enough time to properly adjust, depending on how fast he was moving forward. Also, it looks like they're in a city, which can kind of mess with TCAS if it has tall buildings.

Maitreya is not a historical individual, but rather, is an incarnation of Buddha who is prophesied to appear on Earth sometime in the future.

I don't know enough about East Asian Buddhism to really answer why or when Budai became identified with Maitreya, but I think it is worth noting that the ""fat Buddha"" is not the same person as the calm, relaxed Gautama Buddha. Budai is popular in Japan (where he is known as Hotei) as well as in China, yet there are quite a few statues of Gautama Buddha in Japan as well.","1414800027"

When I need to restore from a broken config/state I can just do that by reverting a snapshot on the OS disk itself.

I only need to use the snapshots on the other disk if my OS disk should itself fail completely.

My Debian OS is about 10GB and I take nightly snapshots and keep them for a month.  What is essentially 10 full snapshot copies of my OS only takes 25GB including my OS, so about 15GB for 30 snapshots.  Pretty nice as a traditional backup would take 300GB for 30 copies of 10GB.

3. Food is a big reason to travel to Singapore. Make sure you try at least one dish from each of the three ethnic groups: Chinese, Malay, and Indian. Just head into a hawker centre and look around, it's a great experience.","1414800035"

What I mean by that is, Scarra knows the community is sick of Link under performing and now he has admitted to being unmotivated (confirms all our suspicions). In turn, Link is giving CLG lip service about suddenly finding motivation. 

Link has done this before, and with circumstances different this time around, I think this will only prolong his stay on CLG for a short while until he stops caring again. The difference is this time there is a full time coach to make a judgement call. You don't lose all motivation and suddenly get it back this many times, and it takes more then motivation, it takes drive and grinding levels of determination (something Link lacks enough of). 

I think the plan is to keep Link. I think it's always been the plan. From the way Hotshot has spoken about it cryptically, I believe the tryouts were setup to scare Link into taking this seriously, but I hope it results in someone hungrier taking over. ","1414800039"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I graduated 11 months ago.

I am 23.

I majored in Electrical Engineering.

I had several job offers prior to graduation.  I chose to start working 24 days after my graduation ceremony.

I currently work as a software developer in Texas.

I am salaried at $96k per year with a target 10% bonus, $2k health incentive, and 6.25% 401k matching.  Total of which comes out to about $114k.

Ignoring vacation and holidays, and assuming 8 hour workdays (which is fairly accurate), I make $53.33 an hour in base salary or about $63 counting the bonus, retirement savings, and HSA contributions.

Edit: Fudged numbers slightly (base salary and total are the same) to preserve company anonymity.","1414800039"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;I go back to my example above. Would you not be upset if a vendor/rapper/homeless guy/etc came up to you every 10 minutes and asked for a favor, EVERYDAY?

The only problem with that example is that the video is trying to prove that ALL women ALL the time are under CONSTANT attack by men to the point where ALL women feel like they're about to be raped at any moment all the time every day. Not only are they in the densest population center in the country by more than double, a good portion of the video seems to be in some of the most impoverished areas of the city as well. And this sort of intrusive behavior is typically a class issue more than anything else.


I'd be willing to bet substantial money that if a camera followed the same woman on her normal daily walking routine for as long as it takes to accumulate 10 hours of footage that the number of ""harrassments"" would be much much much lower.","1414800040"

"ArtistLounge","t5_2yjxy","Well, I've long meant to do a semi-canonical write up of the basic premise (the rules are all somewhat pliable) but I run no less than a half dozen active projects in parallel at a time.  The closest to progress shots I have are the occasional ones I put on Instagram (inasmuch as some sketches become full blown submissions or paintings go through several stages of development before reaching final)

But one aspect that plays out here is for any canvas where I can slap it onto a scanner, I will often pick 'slabs' of a work, and sample it (i'll sometimes use a handcam, but its never as good as scanning at 600DPI) as Im working.  I use that to keep a large archive of slabs that I return to -- when I have new base layers, I'll often try to start marrying them with older slabs or pieces from them.  

Most of the time I start these projects from a purely improvisational bent, but sometimes I have a semi-coherent idea of what the end goal is (i.e. Darque: http://zeruch.deviantart.com/art/darque-478706168 ), and I'll also take some bristol sheets or cold press board and paint and draw on that to where I think things need to be specific to an idea.

Then the rest of the time (which is often non-trivial) is playing in layers, histograms and color balance/selection/replacement, until a complete stage is reached.

I also remix my own images,in that sometimes I'll return to stuff ages later and try to rework it with whatever new knowledge I've gleaned.  

The result is generally very cathartic for me, because its process driven discovery, and I can ignore or repeat the processes as needed (there is no kind of 'forced chain of steps).  Basically you are correct that I am heavily materials based, but once those materials make it to a surface, what can be extracted and interpolated is totally open ended.

Oddly, I still consider myself far more of a traditional artist than a digital one.

"iran","t5_2qhzq","It's worth pointing out that US politics usually (always?) classifies foreign enemies as inherently insane. This is actually a dangerous foreign policy position to take, but it's culturally convenient for us. If we had to accept that our opponents are sane then we'd have to deal with more difficult questions.

This has an interesting correlation to American super hero mythos. I remember being a kid and watching super hero movies like Batman and actually finding it strange that the villains were only ever insane and that no otherwise valid reason was given for their behavior. Of course they had backstories that explain how they went insane, but the insanity factor was the common basis. I think it has to do with the way Americans perceive conflicts in terms of good versus evil. I remember debating with people on Reddit about the fact that the Nazis even had a rationale (even if it was flawed) for exterminating Jews. Many people emotionally insisted that the Nazis had *no* rationale. Like, what the hell fantasy world do you live in?","1414800043"

Programming is the same. If you want to build a simple Android app that takes a photo and then emails it to a set of friends, you have to build it logically. First you would want to make a button that when pressed on, opens up the camera app. Then you would want to add in a textfield that takes in valid emails, and finally, you email. That's what it means to break down the problem. 

You're still in high school. You've barely touched cs. Your friend can solve problems in a better way because he has the experience (he's a software engineer). Give it another few years and you'll have the experience too. It's good that you've already started programming in hs.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For figures in antiquity, that is an unreasonable standard. If you're going to apply the same standard to every single figure in history, you're going to be forced to conclude that almost everyone ever has not existed. There is simply not that kind of evidence for the ancient world; that's the reality of it. A lot of evidence simply doesn't survive.

That's simply not true, and even your goto example had physical evidence going for him.  
  
&gt; just like we would be foolish to reject the Bible.   
  
No, we would be morons of massive proportions to accept it.  
  
&gt; And we would be foolish to expect coins or something similar for Jesus.   
  
Coins, yes, of course. He wouldn't have been a ruler. Contemporary texts, no. The bible describes him as a very popular figure, a celebrity even (Matthew 4:23-25; John 12:12-19).  
  
&gt; Are they attested by other important historians, such as Tacitus or Josephus?  
  
Actually, at least one of those was written by a non-Norse! Snorri Sturlusson was a christian.  
Anyway, you claim was that the fact the bible had several authors was evidence itself, not Tacitus and Josephus.  
Too bad the Tacitus and Josephus mentions were medieval forgeries.  

&gt; And one Bart Ehrman is worth thousands of Richard Dawkins on the matter of Jesus' historicity. Dawkins is a brilliant biologist, but he has no place arguing about history. History is not a science, and should not be treated as such.  
  
He's got every right to doubt unsourced beliefs, as does anyone else.
  
&gt; Again, if you seriously doubt the historical existence of Jesus, offer an alternate explanation of how Christianity sprang up around his teachings within 5 or 10 years of his death, as Paul records in Galatians. Without any sort of alternate explanation, that theory is bunk.  
  
That onus is not on me. I need not offer any alternate explanations. This is the problem with theists: when they don't know, instead of saying ""I don't know"", they posit wild hypotheseses. We don't do that.  
Not that it's hard to understand how christianity spread so fast: the poison is well-crafted. It's academic to wonder exactly how it did, one can only bemoan the fact that it did.

[Spaceflight Services](http://spaceflightservices.com/pricing-plans/) shows prices that start at $300k for 5kg payload. They've launched 10 payloads as secondaries on 6 vehicles in the past two years.

I expect people would be willing to pay somewhat more to be the primary customer for a launch.

On the gripping hand, if it were a sure-fire business opportunity, someone would already be doing it. Interorbital's people think they can make it work (though their rocket design is quite different from what I posted above), but it remains to be seen if they can pull it off.","1414800047"

warlock - felhunter dispel has a long CD and only dispels 1 thing.

DK's icy touch, first requires a glyph and second requires a rune, depending on what spec you are this is anywhere from 2-6 uses, and if you use it 6 times well than you have no dmg left.

and than both mage/hunters cost a lot of resource to use 2-3 dispels, and now frost/fire mages don't have any mana gem or evo so it's not like before were you could dispell until you were oom and than regen.

and than also the 5 other classes which don't have a dispel making priest not worth the effort to attack.","1414800049"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; It's my belief that hunters do not want a naturally stable population of deer because they want to be able to hunt and kill for sport.

Well, you have believe what you want, but it's not grounded in anything factual.

A healthy population is necessary to being able to continue to hunt for years to come.  Hunters want to continue being able to hunt.  Being able to hunt means a large number of animals.  

Additionally, Deer in a lot of places are exceeding their carrying capacity.   Without hunting, they would overwhelm the food supply in those areas, which doesn't just affect deer, but the other species in the area.

But, hey, letting deer and other species starve to death is morally superior than hunting them and having the meat go to help feed people, right?

I can also, as Steven Segal did, show obvious support for Putin and Russia. I can say obscenities, I can produce independent movies about our own country's war crimes.

That's because to those in power, gay marriage matters not. The locals can fight over it while those in power stay in power. However, you're really exaggerating gay rights in the US. There's still many **states** where you can get fired for being gay. And queer bashings still happen. And, just a fun fact, a higher percent of black men are in prison right now in the U.S. then during South African apartheid.

&gt;systematic oppression of free speech, manipulation of public opinion, intentional data distortion that happens every day in Russia. Why, as an academic, would I want to be a coerced empty voice? 

The media system is run by a group of 5 or 6 oligarchic companies. It's not state run like in Russia, but it's still pretty bad, IMO. Yes, you can make your own shitty blog, no you won't change the public opinion with it.

&gt;There is a reason Russia's population has been sinking like the Titanic and their male life expectancy is pitiable. That isn't the West's fault!

Never said it is.

&gt;Bear in mind also that Russian exploitation of Belarus and Ukraine led starving citizens to cannibalism and killed millions (~1933).

If I can bring up atrocities that the U.S. did back then... There's just so many. I'm going to ignore that and lead to the assumption that both governments have changed, and the cold war made both do some shady shit.

&gt;They killed many more within their own borders. Again, can America be blamed for the parts they have inflicted on themselves?

Again, past. However, how many Natives has the U.S. killed? And put into reservations and then taken their resources after finding them in the tribal lands? This is all recent stuff.

&gt;If Russia has tried to do what the US did during the Iraq War with misleading information, they have achieved only a piecemeal farce. 

Maybe outside of Russia, yes. But inside? They are doing fine.

&gt;The achilles heal of their previously-growing economy is exposed to the world. 

Gas? It was not exposed, it was well known. And They are getting more and more connected to China. 

&gt;Also, don't forget how many of the internationally rich are indeed Russians themselves.

There's a few. However, the majority of them are bankers, politicians, and businessmen. And almost all are from the U.S. and Western Europe.

Want actual examples of what the U.S. does? 

http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Economic-Hit-John-Perkins/dp/0452287081

Or go look up the Banana wars, Pinochet, Depleted Uranium in Iraq, the deals that the IMF and World Bank give nations that give it money in exchange for austerity measures that take away money from the people in governments. It doesn't matter to they whether or not gays can get married. 

I'm not exactly pro-Russia. I'm Anti-U.S. And there is a long history of the U.S. forcing revolutions in regions it deems unfriendly, which is where Maiden started. And before you say I'm wrong, seriously, look up Pinochet. Look up the Bay of Pigs. Or here, just look through this list.

They use sp because they just want to stomp people with it to get MVPs. You saying ""they have to"" at lvl 50 is almost certainly not true... They do it because they are lazy and don't want to try hard for 50 MVP wins with the car or carbine. Not saying I blame them, but let's be real here, they aren't spamming sp because they have a hard time getting kills

"funny","t5_2qh33","Well, you actually do have opinions on sexism in videogames, and those opinions are conservative and involve maintaining the status quo.  I don't mean ""conservative"" in a negative political sense, I mean it in the literal sense that you don't think things should change.  

You aren't a pig because you like Bayonetta, and she never says that.  At the beginning of each video, she says something to the effect of ""You can enjoy games and still criticize them"".  In fact, all of us do this, it just doesn't involve criticizing them in relation to female equality.  It's what is happening in every single video game review you have ever read: the individual is saying they enjoyed the game, but here's where they can do better.  All Anita Sarkeesian is doing is saying she enjoys certain games, but they could do a better job of projecting a positive image of women.  

The fact that guys are getting so worked up about this is really confusing to me.  If the main character in Bayonetta looked like a normal woman rather than a huge-titted pornstar, would it make the game any less fun?  No, so I don't see why people get so offended and defensive about such a small change to the industry.","1414800060"

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","&gt; Everyone comes in with preconceived notions, and TB's act is ultimately a false one due to the impossibility of objectivity.

TB's first response about gamergate was this: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s4nmr1/. Everyone would consider this a neutral stance with a focus on something he cares about, DMCA requests (since it affects his work). Because of this neutral stance, he was harassed/bullied a lot by the anti-GG side back when this wasn't even called gamergate. Yes, you're correct that now he has preconceptions about one side or the other based on his experience, but at least at first he seemed to not care about either side and just focused on what mattered to him.

&gt;His pretension to moderation ultimately means that he gives more credence to GG than is necessary.

This mentality is ultimately what made TB support the pro-GG side more (and what makes other neutral people, like Pakman, also start supporting GG more: http://puu.sh/cy2l1/7cf5f01b7b.png), as I just explained. His neutrality was misconstrued as an attack and so here we are and that's why I said what I said about the ""us or them"" thing.

However, I already discussed this with someone else regarding why I think he's mostly a reasonable person: http://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/2kqszz/ethics_in_games_media_total_biscuit_interviews/clox7id

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","Extreme double standards may as well be one of the core tenets of being an SJW. That's why it's such a militant world view. Everything on 'your side' basically can do no wrong. While the other side's wrongs are to be magnified and complained about endlessly. The reason why it's impossible to find SJWs who own up to their mistakes or wrongdoing is because their world view basically forbids tattling on their own. Basically everything spirals back to how they're the victims and you're the oppressor/offender. Spin that situation around and admit to the opposite, and suddenly you aren't a 'warrior' for the cause. You're suddenly not an SJW at that point.

As I say, were I in that situation, I can imagine that I'd be much the same way, as I too can be very detached and passive when I feel situations are beyond my ability to contribute meaningfully. It's only REALLY suspicious because she was found dead, but at the time, her friends thought she was either somewhere with her new beau or in California.

Logic and arguments are 100% fine of course. It's when you pick and choose when to use it that bothers me, which is something you are personally very guilty of. 

You are straight up *not* able to say ""This is fact in this universe because it's fact in another, I don't need proof outside of that!"" Then turn around and deny proof *in* universe. That is bullshit and everyone knows it. When discussing planet+ striking you were given three examples, you refuted everyone of them on the basis of their durability. The VERY next day to prove Supermans, you used the Mongol scan. 

You want to use logic in arguments? Lets use some logic. If Master Roshis energy blast can a moon and EoS Goku is literally unfathomable amounts stronger, and ki=how physically strong you are. It more than stands to reason Gokus punches are OBVIOUSLY stronger than Roshis energy blasts. 

You know how you get stronger in the DBZ Universe? You train, when you train your body strengthens. When you meditate, your mind strengthens. What does this all mean? Your ki raises to new heights. You put Ki into your fists and you can manifest it in blasts. Those are facts of DBZ. Break it down one more time.

Ki=strength. 

Energy blast = Ki

Punch = Ki.

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","not many things i can tell a new player who's only at tier 3-4.

things i'd say is:

1. play medium and heavy tanks because you learn most from them, to be frank about it td's don't really have much to learn, sure theres a lot to master but generally playing td's is pretty simple to say the least.

2. avoid light tanks, you don't really know about spotting mechanics and camo rating so trying to scout without dying a horrible death being somewhat useless is very slim.

3. if you have not yet noticed, high explosive ammo is generally useless and you should avoid using it against mediocre armour, it's for extremely lightly armoured tanks and rear-side of tanks.

4. use consumables if you have a premium account, they will save you from having dead drivers all game or broken guns.

around tier 5-6 you want to know about what the armour layout on your tank and the strong tanks on your tier and the one above is and learn the weakspots of said hard to penetrate tanks, i'd ask back after you've played around 2k games.

just gotta say you have a lot to learn and read up on.. weakspots, angling, map positions, map knowledge, game flow, spotting mechanics, situational awareness, flanking, focus fire and a few other things.

don't be disheartened by comments you may receive from others as 65% of the community suck ass anyway.

I wasn't always in agreement with their choices as the primary mod there, but it was very interesting as an experiment, and the discussions that took place were invaluable in shaping my understanding of our options to create and moderate these little communities. Would you care to elaborate on the issues you had with their moderation?

Personally I think reddit is basically beyond hope. There are very few subreddits that manage to uphold the quality of discussion and submissions of even the original main reddit before subreddits were introduced. I don't really follow the mod drama of this subreddit closely but it hardly seems unreasonable for k6t9 to request that we simply adhere to the reddiquette. ","1414800076"

One: their judgement existence would only make sense if the legal system was clogged with so many criminal cases that they would turn toward a computer program. 

Two: Why even have humans as cops behind them? They could just have drones or robots do the job.

Three: They are even more cruel than current firearms. They explode the target at a certain number, while a person with a gun has to be extremely accurate to kill someone. People are more likely to survive a gun wound, and have the chance for criminal rehabilitation. 

Then there is the problem where all those cops just rely solely on the computers judgement instead of reading the situation and using psychology. The recent police riots in Ferguson, MO, USA are a perfect example why the police force needs limitation on its arsenal. ","1414800077"

We do not allow the use of self.posts to share music streams. Please submit your tracks the way everyone else does.

New England Patriots, not much to say other than They've been good for quite some time. Bellicheck is also quite... interesting.

Right now Manchester City sounds like a little like the Denver Broncos. But with less hate, and the super spending spree is only a recent thing. (You can't really just buy your way to a championship in the NFL, only contention)


&gt; West Ham United. Fans are thugs. Proper Cockney geezers. Team are average but have a sort of cult status globally. 

Oakland Raiders, they're famous for influencing gang culture. They've cleaned up recently, and are the worst team in the NFL though.

&gt; Manchester United. The most well-known soccer team internationally and the most successful

Dallas Cowboys, they are called 'america's team,' and have gone 8-8 for several seasons lately, however, that looks to change this year, for the better.

&gt; Leicester City. New to the Premier League and are struggling. No outstanding players but have a fairly rich owner.

pains me, but the Jacksonville Jaguars. the franchise is only 20 years old and hasn't been doing well for the past few years.

&gt; West Bromwich Albion. Not a very well-known team. Nothing to write home about. Below average all around really.

Tennessee Titans. you stole the words straight out of my keyboard

&gt; Swansea City. Welsh team who are dark horses and currently sit 6th in the league. Never used to be good but have had a good few seasons.

Either the Arizona Cardinals or the Cincinnati Bengals. Both are historically cringe worthy and old franchises, however, both are currently good teams.

&gt; Newcastle United. Had a good spell in the 1990s with Alan Shearer, who was a cult figure in Teeside. Times have been tough recently and they are a lower-mid-table team with a large and passionate fanbase.

Buffalo Bills, the fanbase isn't large, but it sure is passionate. They made it to 4 straight superbowls in the 90's, but haven't really done much since. However, this looks to be a promising season so far.

&gt; Southampton. A team that consistently produces great youth players. Currently 2nd in the league. Never used to be a great team but have all of a sudden skyrocketed to the top of the league. Lost many good players in the summer 

You just described the Seattle Seahawks (defending Superbowl champions). Only catch is they're not looking the greatest right now.

&gt; Burnley. Worst team in the league who were just promoted from the league below. No EPL-worthy players and a few older players. Not very exciting at all.

I'm bringing this one up because this doesn't happen in the NFL. There are 'lesser leagues' like the Arena League and the CFL, but NFL teams stay NFL teams.","1414800079"

Pikachu is squishy as balls and doesn't even have strong special attack to compensate.  

The real question is how does he almost beats the legendary users.  The most likely answer is that the legendary users are happy when they see a 10 year old who is excited about Pokemon.

Pero en Mayo de este año, el mismo día de la eufórica noche de Podemos con las elecciones europeas, un coche sin luces y a 190 km se estrelló contra el mio, mi coche totalmente destrozado pero yo ileso. Y el otro conductor falleció en el acto. 
Con esto te digo que lo de estar más o menos lisiado no te debe preocupar tanto. ..estás vivo! 
Te deseo lo mejor amigo. 
Mucha salud y mucho ánimo. 
Y a pelearnos para que nuestros próximos años disfrutemos de un país más justo y con menos sinvergüenzas. ..nos lo merecemos pero nos lo tenemos que currar. ..cada uno a su manera y con las fuerzas de que dispongamos. 
Un afectuoso saludo y buenas noches","1414800081"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;But the difference is that the Democrat position is actually supported by studies showing that a lot of eligible voters lack the requisite ID. The evidence that in-person voter fraud is any kind of significant problem is extremely weak and anecdotal.

Who funded the studies?
Seriously, I have read deep into multiple studies on other politically divisive issues enough to know that studies will find whatever the researchers wanted to find, and peer review will not call them out on obvious cherry picking, especially for the more left leaning causes, so your difference is no difference at all, just a different type of claim.

&gt;It's also common sense. In-person voter fraud is an extremely risky process that takes place in front of dozens of witnesses, and the penalties for election fraud are already severe. And what is the individual criminal's reward for taking all that risk? What's the likelihood that the few additional votes you give your favorite candidate are actually going to make the difference?

How is it risky, the workers cannot demand ID, cannot detain you, and in urban areas are highly unlikely to know who you are on sight. Sure the penalties are high, but penalties are of little importance when the risk of getting caught is so low.

&gt;I also think basic economics supports the idea that the more requirements you put on voting, the less voting you get.

I have literally never once in my entire life seen such anyone assert that women, as a class, feel threatened every time a man talks to them without permission.  It's preposterous.  

She's setting up a ridiculous strawman, someone who is somehow even stupider and more fanciful than the infamous _I can open my own doors!_ feminist harpy who only exists in the internet's most fevered imagination.  It's a painfully transparent to lick reddit's asshole by shifting discussion away from any acknowledgement of actual problems to some imaginary comic book supervillain.

Either way you get billed the next month because even if you open ANOTHER savings account for the scheduled transfer, it is closed because they make sure the transfer doesn't happen. when they close the account, all funds in the savings account is marked as being transferred to the checking account, bit it never made it in.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm not sure I fully understand their Champion roster rules—some Champions seem to be tagged, perhaps as possible additions?—so it's a bit difficult to say.

In terms of Factions history, you can see a list of how they each placed **[here](http://leaguefactions.net/factions-of-runeterra/)**. Part of the trick is that it's hard to disentangle the inherent strength of each faction from the caliber of the communities that arose around each one.

It might be fun to make a Factions betting pool or something to see what the Factions community would guess. We'd need to confirm what the actual rosters are, of course.

All those disclaimers aside, here are my initial intuitions:

**First Round**  

I think the higher-skillcap factions like Ionia and Piltover will punch above their usual weight in this pro tourney, beating out the all-in ""dogpile"" comps.

* Bilgewater beats the Freljord
* Ionia beats Demacia
* Shurima beats SI
* Piltover beats Noxus

**Second Round**  

* Bilgewater beats Ionia
* Piltover beats Shurima

**Final Round**  

At the end of the day, I think Bilgewater would beat Piltover. Piltover's lack of a tank is going to hurt them pretty sorely.

I'll have to think about this some more, though. For example, if the ""flagged"" SI Champions really are just on the roster guaranteed, then it starts to look more like Discord (Void/SI), which was devastatingly effective.","1414800095"

Notice how they worded it: These Sparrows aren’t considered “Halloween Sparrows” to them – that is all.

They are still coming, eventually.

---

Everyone referred to these as the ""Halloween Sparrows"" because they were added/found in the database the same day that the actual Halloween items were found.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Not great. Starting week 3 of HRT, anxiety over being an imposter/fraud has reached fever pitch. 

It doesn't matter how badly I want this (I still move forward full steam ahead) or how lovely the moments when I feel or look like a girl are, my brain will still find doubt in times of anxiety.

I have ADHD comorbid with moderate to severe anxiety, and what feels like low to moderate depression. Add gender dysphoria with a lifetime of repression and you have one fucked up girl. I live on my own, and function, I go to work and bills eventually get paid. Im stabilizing my house of cards right now. But mentally I suffer daily.

What this means for me is that on a daily basis, I will become numb and apathetic for a time. I will not care about anything and only negativity, fear, and anxiety take hold. The favorite topic is the legitimacy of my girl identity, ad how its not real. My brain will temporarily find no joy in anything, including becoming a girl, at which point it uses that as a springboard to nullify my girl identity.

It hurts, a lot. Some have seen my posts on here and see it in action. I pushed a good friend away with my neurotic behavior and crises.

Now that the HRT is beginning to work, the lows are lower. They hurt even more, and give my brain further ammunition (see? The HRT is making you worse, you're obviously not a girl)

So yeah, its been a rough week. I dont think my therapist can even keep up with everything.

I have mental illness, and its unclear how HRT will affect it. It certainly will not rid me of it, and im expecting to at least need ADHD medication, possibly anxiety/depression meds.

Being this fucked up sucks. ","1414800099"
"offmychest","t5_2ranw","Well well, this kinda seems interesting, at least for me. 

I wouldn't worry that much about what people say and think about this. Saying something like ""she must be weird since she doesn't have any friends"", just shows how little they know about you. Maybe if THEY tried to get to know you or hang out with you, they'd have a whole different perspective about you. Who knows. But hey, people are people and they love to judge, as sad as that seems to sound.

I'm kinda similar when it comes to this. I do have friends but I don't really consider them friends. Okay, that makes zero sense, but maybe you'll understand what I'm trying to say.

*I can't move. Why can't I speak?* Eltzar thought to himself. His mind screamed for him to get up. Retrieve his weapon. Fight.


.



*They're counting on you. Get up and fight!*





.


His mind screamed once more, its volume loud enough to have deafened him if his eardrums hadn't been destroyed already. The aliens, the filthy xenos had already won the war, that much was obvious. Only a simpleton would say there was still hope in victory. Now it was just the matter of trying to give people time to escape to shelters dug deep into mountains or hidden within the oceans. Death Companies, they were known as, meant to draw incursions away from the escape corridors for as long as possible. Eltzar was part of Death Company Omicron, or what was left of it. His Captain had been obliterated by an exotic energy weapon that the invaders seemed to favour and what was left of his unit was scattered throughout the now scarred, smouldering ruins of a shattered city.


.


At the edge of his vision he could see the distinct shape of Drazz, his power armour caked in a mixture of ash and blood forming a grey-red mud that almost covered his armoured frame, struggling in a frantic battle with two of the cursed invaders.


.


*Help him! FIGHT! RISE UP!* Tears streaked down Eltzars face as he tried to will his body to life once again. Drazz weaved to and fro, his combat sword whistling through the air as he duelled with the enemy. Eltzar could see that his friend didn't have hope of victory. Drazz knew it too. Against one, perhaps 1 in 20 men stood hopes of victory in hand to hand combat. Against two, it was only a matter of time before they grew tired of toying with him. Their curved blades swiping deep furrows into his armour and carving channels into his muscled frame. Any other species would have run at the outset. Drazz wasn't other species. His muscled flesh quivered with rage as he danced, back-pedalling and dodging what attacks he could while desperately blocking with his remaining gauntlet, swiping madly with his sword.


.



""You're weak. You cannot stand against us, filthy human. Die like the insect you are."" The monotonic translator bolted to an alien throat emitted as the larger of the two swirled over Drazz. Trying to counter too late, Drazz couldn't avoid the strike and fell to his knees, arms crashing to the ground beside him, sheered from his frame like a broken toy.


.


*UGH-KILL-SWORD-MOVE-DRAZZ-AWLKJRGKLJHWNBMWQER* 


.


Eltzar's mind snapped, his anger forcing life into his tattered remains. Slowly, his body began to twitch.


.


 *I won't let you win. I can't let you win!*  


.


.
The alien spun at the sound of anguish, rage and despair that Eltzar had forced through his lungs. Another armoured human was alive, its broken and torn body lay atop a pile of rubble. Amused, the alien ignored it, returning its focus to its kill. The warrior before him was still on its knees, attempting to stand, presumably to run away, the alien mused. Surprisingly enough, the human didn't run away, instead, falling to its knees once more in front of a cylindrical bronze object that bore the image of the human and its family and began to speak, the translator unit in its the alien skull indicated the human was apologising, mentioning it would rendezvous with the humans later than anticipated. Scoffing at such sentimentality, it motioned its subordinate to finish Drazz and the began to walk towards Eltzar, pulling a small knife.


.


The alien stood over Eltzar. His mind feverishly commanding his body to move. To move. To fight. A pain shot through Eltzars body, pain so intense he feared he might fall unconscious but, slowly, his right arm rose over his head.


.


Move, damn you! he begged his body. Please, don't let them win. His vision focusing on Drazz as his friend was slaughtered, then at the locket as the smaller of the two aliens picked it up. ""Don't touch that!"" he screamed, blood spurting through his nose with the effort. Surges of adrenaline flooded through his body as he pushed himself off the ground. His jaw clenched so hard in rage his teeth shattered in his mouth as he tried to run past the larger alien to his friend and locket. ""You will not touch it! You will not hurt them! You will not w-"".

.

*Win*, Eltzar thought. His head torn from his shoulders as he tried to rush past the larger alien that towered over him. The alien held his face to his as if studying the final moments before the last of Eltzar's life drained away. *Fuck you* Eltzar thought and tried to spit, only to drool blood from his bottom lip.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","""It's your own fault when something outside of your control changes your life circumstances"", is essentially what you just said. 

I think you would do well to read up on [this](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). We tend to attribute our own successes internally and our failures externally, and vice versa for others. It's easy to say ""well he lost his job because computers"", but if there's one thing I know about technology its unpredictable. Are you seriously telling workers that they need to look 20 years into the future and predict what kind of jobs will still be available? By some estimates, 75% of the labor force could be automated - even the most conservative estimates put that number around 45%. Could you imagine the strain to the economy is 45% of people were suddenly jobless?

Besides that, experiments have shown that the brain ""freezes"" by your 30s, making it immensely harder to pick up a new skill set (not impossible however, and research shows neuroplasticity is quite long-lived). Are you really telling the 50-year-old factory worker, who have never interfaced with a modern computer in any meaningful fashion, that he should just go back to school and learn how to program the machines who replaced him? How successful do you imagine that would be?

My point is that people are trying to move forward, but computers move and change faster than people ever will. The only thing computers won't be able to do is experience a human life in all its wonder and complexity - so that's what we should be concentrating our efforts in. Not in new and more imaginative ways to keep people running on the hamster wheel.","1414800104"

You can do this. You've made it this far - just keep on paddling a little bit further and you'll be through. You're a lot better than you think you are. You've made it to your senior year in Comp Sci - whether you've struggled with it or not to this point is irrelevant. You've made it to your senior year, and all you have to do is pass a few simple classes and right some code - nothing you haven't done before - and then you'll be done. 

As for your advisor, perhaps explain some of this to him? Just say something like you've been under a lot of stress from your other classes so you haven't had much time to get much done on the capstone project. He's there to help you - he should understand.

In my opinion, the more the series made it's descent into complete whackiness, the better it got. 
The story lines got more random and unpredictable, the characters more out there... it's like they freed themselves from any kind of limiting stuff - like continuity or common sense.

Starting with season 3-4 True Blood imho is one, if not the best show ever made on television. It's just so madly entertaining it's insane. 
Plus some of THE best characters I've ever seen developed (except of course for some trainwrecks like sooki, but hey...). Take Jason. He's just running circles around everything his character was supposed to be originally.

And then there's these utterly weird and fantastic scenes. Like the gay dream scene Jason has. Or the hate sex scene with the head turning.
Man. 

TL;DR: True Blood's early seasons are the ones that actually sucked. The show was meant to be pulp, and it only really got beautifully wicked in the later seasons!","1414800113"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Okay I kind of avoided going into this before because it's confusing to say that the speed of sound doesn't depend on the density of the gas and then go and list gases of different densities that have different speeds of sound. In the rest of this thread, people keep trying to make the point that the density of a single gas of constant composition, air, has an impact on the speed of sound. It does not. I don't want to cause confusion by adding more complications. The differences in densities here have nothing to do with the ideal gas law. The nuclei of the denser gases are simply more massive. The gases are not compressed. There are not more molecules in a given volume, in fact for all of these gases at STP, there are ALWAYS 6.022*10^23 molecules in every 22.4L volume of space. Same number of molecules, same spacing between them, different masses. This is important because they have greater inertia and resist movement, thus transferring the pressure waves more slowly. I hope this makes sense. The molecular weight is used in determining speed of sound, NOT density. For example, you could compress hydrogen gas to the density of Radon gas at STP, but its speed of sound would not change if it were still at 0 degrees C. Density and molecular weight are just correlated.","1414800117"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.

That is to say, we do not have any evidence that the miracles of Jesus weren't recorded by eye-witnesses.  We simply either a) haven't discovered them yet, or b) they no longer exist.  Or c) they never existed.

Assuming C is a logical fallacy.

That being said, if we do assume C, what do we get?

First:  Jesus was not the only person to have performed miracles throughout the Bible.  Old Testament accounts are littered with accounts of miracles occurring due to divine intervention of some form or another.

Second:  Miracles also didn't end with Jesus.  Acts has accounts of miracles throughout, and we have accounts of miracles within Christianity to modern history.

These are important in the scope of your question, because the miracles Jesus performed are a sign of his divinity, and that we each can, too, be divine.  In [Matthew 17:20] Jesus stated that if a believer has faith, they too can perform miracles.  Couple this with Corinthians  12, and the discussion of spiritual gifts, and the idea that miracles are attainable for the common believer is very appealing.

Then, if you consider that there is documentation that Jesus was not the only one to have performed miracles, thus one does not have to be the Son of God to perform miracles, and that may be the reason for their appeal.","1414800118"

They aren't being asked to write a thesis on social nuances. 

 Although it's not fully developed, children aren't absent a cerebral cortex.

"PSO2","t5_2sjei","There's a major difficulty gap between VH and SH. Many bosses will often have added attack or a slightly different move-set or attack pattern. For example, Zeshrayda (darker turtle) gets a major speed boost below 50%, Vol Dragon chain its attacks up to 3 times instead of 2 with map-wide eruption that has double the damage of what it was in VH and tracks where players are instead of erupt randomly, etc.

The simplest solution is to get better units. Units like Hiei set is nice for normal all the way up to VH, but it's not enough for later stages of SH. Loser set and Saiki set are both popular SH units with balanced defensive stats and nice set bonuses.

Another way to not die as fast is to sub Hu if you play a S-atk or R-atk class, get Automate Halfline and you're golden, just to remember to stock up your mates if you suck at dodging. If you're a T-atk class that is not using Jet Boots and Wand Lover, you should ask yourself why you suck so much with that nearly 2 second dodge.","1414800120"

So, while I agree that this level of insecurity *would* be incredibly grating,  you need to let her know that she's crossing the line, big time, and remind her that absolutely nothing changed other than you taking a nap.  Tell her that this is dangerous for your relationship and for future relationships.

I mean, react how you think is appropriate, but since she has no background, she needs to know that this is the sort of thing that sinks a relationship in its tracks.","1414800121"

Birmingham got beat down 0-8 at home last week and now have to travel to a Wolverhampton squad in a 4 way gridlock for control of first place sitting at 4th only on goal differential. It's crucial that they make use of the opprotunity to take a win at home against a struggling team with how tight the top half of the table is with a fair chunk of the season in the books already.  
**Salzburg vs. Admira Wacker Modling under 4 -110| Austria Bundesliga | 1:30pmEST**  
Overwhelming injury concerns for Salzburg all over the field, only 14 players of their 24 man roster will be available, and that's including some players pulled up from their B squad. They haven't scored less than 2 goals at home all season but have never entered a home match this discheveled as well. Admira have not scored in 3 matches and have only allowed 2 goals with 2 clean sheets in that span including an impressive 0-0 draw at Rapid Vienna. Salzburg have a big match out in Croatia against Dinamo Zagreb to defend their top spot in their Europa league pool and must manage what few resources they have carefully so they are prepared to play short staffed on short rest. Don't see much scoring here but Salzburg can still threaten here in their damaged state.

You can also tap the aim button quickly to throw knives at him to stun him. Do not burn him. He hates fire- anything they hate will make them much stronger and harder to kill. I think you best bet is probably to brand a bunch of orcs stealthily and use them to swarm him. if you get into an open fight build your combo stabbing him, then combat brand his friends. keep repeating that until he dies or is surrounded by 20 of your orcs. then just watch him die.","1414800128"

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Parts of South America are tropical, and parts of South America are not tropical. 

Generally speaking, parts of the Earth which are closer to the equator get more sun and are warmer. Parts of the Earth which are further away from the equator (and closer to the poles) get less sun are are colder. [This map shows the average temperatures of various parts of the Earth.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_zone#mediaviewer/File:Annual_Average_Temperature_Map.jpg)

We call the warm equatorial zones ""tropical"" (because they lie between [two lines we call the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn](http://www.solsticebahamas.com/images/Tropic.jpg)). The cold zones near the poles are ""polar"". And the not-too-warm-not-too-cold bits in the middle are ""temperate"". [Here's a map to show how these zones look.](http://www.webquest.hawaii.edu/kahihi/sciencedictionary/images/degreemap.jpg) 

You can see from that map that *part* of South America - the part near the equator - is tropical. Another part of South America - the part further away from the equator - is temperate. And none of South America reaches down into the cold polar zone.

So accomplishment wise, you are good, you have the ""ring"". Maybe now you want to cash in on all the good work you have done, this happens almost always in the professional sports scene.

Please yes, we're not constricted to a handful of keys, there are 100+ available on the keyboard, let us bind one to zooming in.

Overall I haven't been very impressed with the PC port at all. Of course it's an alpha, but I seriously hope this stuff doesn't carry over to the release version. Where is my:

* Benchmarking test or possible bot game where I can test configs
* FOV slider
* Ability to rebind keys and change graphical settings while in the game, having to leave game AND the lobby to do it is absurd, then having to queue up for another game to see if it actually changed anything
* The menu UI seems clunky as hell, felt very much like trying to navigate around a console design with my mouse
* Graphical options? V-sync, AA and tesselation is a good start, but having the rest constrained to an overall low/med/high type of thing screams of consolitis
* I'd mention optimization but since it is an alpha that's obviously (hopefully) something that will come later, right now the fps has no consistency, I get better fps than a buddy that has better hardware

Yes it's an alpha, and that's exactly the time when you're supposed to give this type of feedback. We don't want another Watch dogs/ AC4 / AC Unity port.","1414800131"

He knew where they lived and was always welcome. He's the one who chose to only show up occasionally. 

He could be in Rory's life without bring in Lorelei's romantic life. The two don't have to go hand-in-hand. ","1414800141"

I don't really think there's any twitch broadcaster who has this view, and I'm sure there are some broadcasters who aren't looking to get rich and instead prefer loyal, interactive viewers.  But really, do you think anyone speaks to EVERY viewer they have?  That they'd rather not have a viewer, than a viewer who doesn't talk in chat?  It's sufficient to say that if they don't want those kinds of viewers (the ones just tuning in to see some skin) then they don't show skin.  ","1414800141"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I'm actually not convinced that the Civ BE AI is actually any worse than the Civ V AI.  The problem is that the game balance is fairly far out of whack right now, and the computer - unlike human players - can't figure out how exploit this.  The problem - at least in my experience - is not that the computer doesn't react to what I do.  Its that I can get to a point where there is literally nothing the computer *can* do, because I outproduce it in absolute terms and its as terrible at combat tactics as it was in Civ V.

Once they fix the worst balance issues - notably trade routes - the AI will be a lot more competitive.  Not because that will make it any smarter, but by forcing my strategies to more resemble how the computer plays (by nerfing the vastly superior options currently available), its production bonuses will matter a lot more, and the games will more closely resemble the Civ V dynamic of dealing with an opponent that, while careless with units, outproduces you to the extent that it can hang in the game anyway.

Whether that's a legitimately interesting way of balancing an AI can, of course, be debated.  But at least it wouldn't be a regression relative to the previous generation.","1414800142"

That's what has me scared more than anything, I'll be honest. The narrative of intimidation the press has been peddling so far is literally making video games look bad for parents. I always said that I was against the ""Death of an Identity"" series of articles because they promoted an atmosphere that hasn't been here since the 80s, when ""gamer"" or ""nerd"" were pejoratives. When I made the connection you mentioned, it was a crisis of faith for me, when I thought maybe #GG should stop.

Practically, I can use it in an emergency situation for communication, as well as receiving NOAA weather broadcasts. Earlier this year my buddy and I were backpacking on the east side of Mt. Hood and there were some active wild fires burning nearby. It was cool to listen to the wildland firefighters' communications. But, more to the point of being unusual, I like to try and pick up a repeater and just listen to the chatter by the fire. One time I found this frequency which was almost like an amateur story-hour.

Why is that? Because I see my phone as a sort of life preserver. If anything happens, it takes less than 10 seconds for me to call 911.

"AskNYC","t5_2uqch","Mohonk and the whole Shawangunk area is really (IMO) the best place you can go for this type of romantic outdoorsy trip that's not really far away. I'd advise staying somewhere in New Paltz and driving to the ridge—it's only about a 10 minute drive. Aside from Mohonk Preserve, there's also Lake Minnewaska and Sam's Point just a few minutes beyond. Minnewaska has an awesome lake and some great overlooks toward the Catskills, and Sam's Point has a popular waterfall trail, the highest point on Shawangunk Ridge, and some famous ice caves (really just caves with a microclimate cold enough to retain snow year-round—maybe not the best autumn/winter attraction). They're state parks, so you just pay a small parking fee instead of the $25 day pass to visit Mohonk.

There's also Lake George a bit farther upstate—that gives easier access to the Adirondacks, which are more impressive than the Catskills or Shawangunk Ridge.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","You know Warehouse 13? It's kinda like that, but better. It's a horror fiction website, formatted to look like secure containment protocols and incident reports from the SCP (Special Containment Procedures) Foundation.

Basically, there's anomalies of varying kinds around the world, and it's their job to contain, study, and keep them hidden from the general populace until they're ""ready"" (if ever). Everything from anomalous zones that magically grant anyone who enters a random piece of knowledge, to immortal, biblical figures, to time travelers, to portals to other worlds, to mythological creatures, to the fountain of youth, even pieces of *information* that make you go crazy or something when you hear, see, or know about it (how do you contain a piece of *information* without being exposed to it?)...etc. They're classified into three groups [(Safe, Euclid, Keter)](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/object-classes) in order of containment difficulty.

My personal favorites are [SCP-231 (Special Personnel Requirements)](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-231) and [SCP-095 (The Red Sea Object)](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-093). Here's [one of the three](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-series) main lists of anomalies written up so far.

There's upwards of 2,000 ""anomalies"" to browse through, and they're stringently kept to high standards by a fantastic moderation team and community.

It's one of the best RP sites I've ever come across. Here's an [""orientation""](http://www.scp-wiki.net/orientation) for new ""recruits"" (agents and researchers alike), here's one for [D-class personnel](http://www.scp-wiki.net/d-class-orientation), and another one for the [O-5 Overseer council](http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-o5-orientation). Keep in mind one hard and fast rule about the Foundation: **There is no canon.** It's like Wikipedia; nothing is true. Sometimes writers like to cross-reference a lot of SCP objects or incident reports, but by and large each reader can make up his or her own mind about what the Foundation is or how it works, the rival organizations, heck, even which anomalies exist within the universe or not.

Here's the official, in-universe [""About the SCP Foundation""](http://www.scp-wiki.net/about-the-scp-foundation) page","1414800150"

"NBA2k","t5_2s84e","I'm not good enough yet to know what is due to my lack of skill and what is a result of a bad defensive mechanic, but here are a couple of things I noticed in comparison to 2k14:

1) You can't use intense D like you did in 2k14, it makes you very vulnerable to crossovers. You have to try to just stay in front of your man, and use intense D for a split second when he tries to blow by you.

2) Your players stats are way more noticeable than in 2k14. I am really torn on whether to play Lillard or Curry online, since they are defensive liabilities. Go play defense with CP3 and then go back to one of those, you'll notice a huge difference. It's way easier to body up a player with a good defender without getting blown by.

3) Team defense matters. Very much like reality, you won't be able to contain your man 1v1 every trip down the floor. Even CP3 can't really keep Curry from scoring in real life. The trick is to limit their effect otherwise. I find that a good defensive big (I use Noah) helps a lot to contain PnR and to help when the first player gets blown by. Look for weaknesses in their offensive game.

4) Get familiar with the defensive presets and their effects. Your opponent uses the PnR to drive to the paint but only has mediocre 3pt shooters to space the floor? Tell your defense to protect the paint, to have the wing defenders help on the drive. You might give up the 3 pointer, but he may as well miss it. There's a good 3pt shooter out there or someone whos really hot? Make sure your defense sticks to him and hope that your big men can successfully contest the layup.

The most important thing: You won't be able to stop your opponent every time. Remember, most of the time it's really good player taking the shot. Melo or KD will make contested baskets. The important thing is, that they don't do so as often as they make open ones. So contest and work to get clean looks on offense. Hell, you might be playing well, getting good looks, contesting everything and be down 10 points in the first quarter, because an opponent shooter is just feeling it and your guys are struggling. It'll even out over the course of the game. Just keep working.","1414800153"

I did some digging though and here's some of the fanfic tier stuff they're putting in the game. This first bit is some of the edgy quotes they used for the characters [1](http://i.imgur.com/GM69cfs.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/BjWNT3D.jpg), [3](http://imgur.com/OD29wSD)

The art style is crap, the gameplay looks like crap from the trailers, Gaider decided not to include dwarven romance options because 'they look like children' (not true at all). He also said he created the first ""Fully gay"" character and his portrayal of the character is so stereotypical it's insane. They retconned the Liana death in DA1 if you chose it (I did) by saying that 'she was only playing dead' which is dumb as hell considering that I cut her head off. They also did some crazy shit to Morrigans jaw to fit with some shitty cosplayer who works at their company [Example](http://imgur.com/no9ewF6), that's her on the left, she is also a bioware employee. This is what new morrigan looks like [in game](http://imgur.com/JUwgjho).

They also suck at making characters, [this first one](http://imgur.com/sY6V3lL) is one of the only (2?) straight romance options, they made her look like a man. There's also [this](http://imgur.com/MdyzErG) character who looks like she has grease on her face and is a bi romance option.","1414800154"

That's debatable... it's been claimed that there was a copy of Elite for every BBC Micro, *including government ones*... that's probably an exaggeration, but still, the game was a huge success for its time. :)

Also, maybe it's because I wasted an awful amount of time on Wing Commander as a child, but I'd also add Roberts to that list (and also Richard Garriott, Ron Gilbert, Roberta Williams, Sid Meier, Peter Molyneux, and probably many others I can't remember right now; there were *a lot* of people who revolutionized video games in various ways!). :D

"movies","t5_2qh3s","This works both ways brother, you once again are assuming that I am mad, upset or angry in some way. None is even close to the truth. I have my preferences for how I enjoy my time and how I spend my money. I have chosen not to visit these establishments that have done very little to deal with the rudeness issues. 

You are saying it is important to you to have your phone with you for true hard core emergencies. I'll give you that having it with you for that is sound although unlikely to the extreme. The odds of you being in a theater with a gunman or a heart attack victim are greater than you getting hit by a bus before or after your film. Problem is that it doesn't address all the rude behavior which is ultimately what I was talking about. I in fact do bring my phone into theaters but I have it on silent and even turn off the vibrate feature. This allows me to be completely un-bothered by my own device as well as making sure I am not bothering anyone else. Now, if it were somehow possible to tell everyone at the door to silence their device before they walk into a theater and even have a door man check that would be awesome, but it would also be completely impractical. Choosing to spend your money in a place that has Banned cell phones though is a choice you would need to make as a consumer. If a theater in your town made such a rule for their customers, that all electronic devices were forbidden, then I would gladly go to that theater. I would vote with my hard earned dollar. You would probably continue going to the theater that allows you to sit with all the other active phone users. Instead no such rules have been attempted by the established businesses so we have the sad case we have today. Serious rudeness and complete disregard for others.

Another thing I would like to point out, and maybe it is an geographical thing but EVERY time in the last 4-5 years that I have gone to a theater anywhere near to the release or the weekend evenings there are phones going off left an right. There are bright screens popping up all over the room. I don't know if that is normal for where you are but in my experience it is the norm here [Tampa Bay Area]. As has been stated by others and even myself, if you go when the crowds are lower and in the non-peak times the chances are much better that the experience will be a good one.

Be well man, and stop labeling me as angry or mad or whatever has been misconstrued here. Everyone is allowed to have their won opinion and we are also free to think each others opinions are shitty. That's life 101.","1414800156"

It also winds up costing a bit of quality in the video because of this compression.

2. The editing is solid, I like your use of cuts. Choice of music is quite good and the timing is definitely there.

3. Consider syncing some of the video's moments up to portions of the music for some more important parts.

Somewhat, and it's what our entire country's based on. The thing is, we need to have a balance over governmental authority and personal liberty.

Last Week Tonight does some pretty solid, but very heavily political and news-based/internal affairs type humour. Already in itself its a fairly niche market to be working in. If you corner the market at specifically European Politics, then you might only have a small base of people to talk to.

I think i like the concept of the idea you are going for, but people who are already fans of LWT probably aren't going to turn to a more condensed and specific version of it. HOWEVER, in saying that, I'm actually interested to see how it will turn out. I think I'm more interested in eating my own words a bit. I would like to see how you take and interpret current affairs in your own comedy style. Its probably going to take a lot of planning, and fairly critical editing on your half to make sure you get it perfectly right as a delivery i feel.

Anyway I'm interested. Keep me posted, if you can!

"TrueAskReddit","t5_2s91q","There wasn't a single box to check for ""All the Democrats"", I just happened to vote for all Democrats. 

While there are many moderate Republicans, the national party still has quite a lot of influence on how they vote (if they want to keep receiving party support in the next election). Despite what an individual may want, if something important to the party base (like new abortion restrictions) is coming up for a vote, and that vote is going to be close, you can pretty much count on anyone with an R next to their name voting the way the national party says to.

Similarly, even a right leaning Democrat is going to side with the party on gay rights, etc. So, even though I may disagree with an individual's campaign platform, a Democrat is more likely to do what I want than a Republican is.

Even though you vote for individuals, the party platform is very important in terms of how they act once in office. As long as the Republican platform includes ""Preserving and Protecting Traditional Marriage"", ""Repealing Obamacare"", and adding a ""human life amendment to the constitution"", it is going to take a very VERY special Republican to get a vote from me.","1414800161"

"Eve","t5_2qil9","Keep in mind that after Phoebe, towers are going to have significantly less HP, to the point where a group of unopposed subcaps can burn the fields of an entire region if left unchecked. The reaver SIG isn't really designed to always be successful at killing towers. It's designed to force entities that want to deploy to CFC space to leave behind a significant portion of their strength for home defense.

So far, from what I gather from the [S2N alliance update](http://themittani.com/news/nulli-secunda-alliance-update-1), it's working. S2N was planning on deploying to Vale after Phoebe, now they're planning on defending their space from reavers.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The government using private information that exists only between citizens and said government, using that information to publically shame people who have differing political opinions: A good thing.

Did anyone say that?    

Oh, that's right: No. Nobody said that. Nor anything like it.

You just made things up to make your case. Must be a pretty bad case.



&gt;I bet if I asked you if you support authoritarian or dictatorship governments, you'd even suffer through the cognitive dissonance to say no, you don't.

No, actually, I *do* support ""authoritarian dictatorships"" if that's what you call everything that isn't democracy.

It's a lot better than corrupt mob rule invariably degenerating into corporate capitalist oligarchic dictatorship (aka ""democracy"").

And I already stated explicitly what I support repeatedly in this thread: Scientocracy using principles of humanist lawmaking and evidence based policy making.

&gt;I don't know what's worse, what I wrote above, or the fact that you're most likely simply a kool-aid drinker who will do anything to protect the party you identify with, the exact same thing you probably take issue with when their side does it.

The worst thing is that you are too ideologically misguided to have a rational conversation. You should stop making things up and start learning to deal with facts and falsifiable statements. For starters, I don't identify with any party. In fact, I think party politics needs to be banned. There should be no parties whatsoever. The only premise a national government should be based upon should be the good of the nation and the people within it. In our day and age that should be extended to the planet and human society. 

Everyone should act in concert, no ideologies. Everyone who can't demonstrate the necessary knowledge about a topic should be eliminated from the process until s/he studied it. Logical debate should prevail and opinion based politics should be eliminated as much as possible. ","1414800165"

"ProtectAndServe","t5_2ug10","&gt;Truth: While Jordan v. New London does establish that scoring too highly on intelligence tests is a legal reason to turn away an applicant, there are no other reported cases of this happening, and Jordan himself was working in corrections by the end of the case.

Actually people misinterpret what that ruling ACTUALLY meant. Jordan filed a discrimination lawsuit against New Jordan because they excluded him based on the results of a test for being ""too intelligent"". The supreme court did **NOT** rule that  
A)Jordan was smart  
B)the test proffered by the police department actually measured any sort of intelligence  
C)police departments should not hire smart people, or that THIS department doesn't hire smart people

All the ruling established was that Jordan filed his claim of discrimination of intelligence, and that his claim was invalid because ""intelligence"" is not a protected class (like race, gender, etc). Therefore, because this department excluded ALL other applicants that scored above that threshhold for THAT round of hiring, they did not err. That's all. Simply ""Your lawsuit is dismissed because being passed over for scoring too highly on that test is not discrimination.""","1414800170"

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;__UY Scuti__ is a bright [red supergiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_supergiant) or [hypergiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergiant) and pulsating [variable star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star) in the [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation) [Scutum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutum). It is currently the [largest known star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_known_stars) at most likelihood, and is one of the most luminous and best-known of its kind. It has the average median radius of 1,708 [solar radii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radii), or a diameter of 2,378,704,272 [km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre) (1,478,914,185.73 [mi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile); 15.9 [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit)); thus a volume 4,982,686,912 times that of the Sun. It is approximately 9,140 light-years (2,300 parsecs) from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), making it one of the nearest known hypergiants. If placed at the center of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System), its [photosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere) would engulf the orbit of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter), although the radius is poorly known and may be larger than the orbit of [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn).

Acorns are such good animal feed, I think you should cultivate the things in oak orchards. 

First, a few points:

1. Some people are trying to breed a human edible acorn, up in Kansas. When they're good, they taste better than just about anything. But the next year the same tree will produce some bitter shit. Would take a major effort and decades or centuries for them to succeed, I think.
2. Acorns are dangerous for sheep and cattle. Gotta keep them away from it. Goats... I read conflicting stuff. But the tannin will definitely cause renal failure in the rest. Pigs? Definitely considered premium feed... the $1000/lb hams from Spain are from hogs finished off of acorn.

Keeping all that in mind, you can probably put 20-30 trees per acre of most oak species (this is for larger trees, like hickory). I think Burr Oak is a good candidate, at least where I am. There's a single mature tree in one of our local parks, if that thing is dumping less than 3000 pounds of acorns in a decent year, I'd be shocked. Big, golf-ball-sized acorns. Even if you figure some shrinkage for water loss in storage, we could still probably get 30,000 lbs of feed for hogs. That's enough to get 35 to finishing weight (isn't it about 800 pounds of feed?). That might be with corn only, and with the commercial white hog, but I bet you can have a nice one to butcher for 1000 pounds of acorns.

These won't impart an unpleasant taste to the meat either, like you get with some of the more oddball stuff.

A few acres, and you could keep half a dozen sows, and finish the litters yourself. Wouldn't spend even a quarter what you would on the same acreage in corn (irrigation maybe? The equipment to harvest the acorns is all I can think of for sure). Would end up with more feed for it. Once you get some mature trees (forget the distance from trunk to trunk in that spacing), you could even grow some grain in between (the Italians like to do this in their olive orchards). Sorghum, probably... supplement the feed for the hogs.

But anyway, to answer your original question, they downvote me because they'd rather eat crummy acorn meal than heirloom pork chops.","1414800174"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","By writing, I'm not talking about the ridiculous contrived plot, I mean the characters themselves.  The writing shines whenever you're talking about the four nutjobs (i.e., Brick, Tannis, Tiny Tina, and Jack, who I think is the most likeable mass murderer this side of Hannibal Lecter.  I know, I know, subjectiev opinion, but when we're talking about whether we enjoy the character, there is no objectivity).

I agree with you that cursing for the sake of cursing isn't funny, frankly, it never has been.

I also don't particularly care whether or not a company is terrible.  EA and Ubisoft are just as bad (if not worse, due to their almost palpable disdain for their own customers), but I still bought all three Mass Effect games (I even enjoyed ME3 with the EC), I've still bought every AC game up to AC4.

I actually bought Borderlands after Borderlands 2, and I thought it felt much slower.  The increased pace of combat (and the fact that it's way more over the top) allows me to tolerate the grinding in Borderlands 2, because I won't be doing it for very long, unless I want a specific weapon.

I'm curious, did you play any of the four main DLCs?  If you haven't I would recommend Campaign of Carnage and Captain Scarlett's Pirate Booty (juvenile, but the main antagonist is likable enough to carry the less-than-inspired plot).

But, in any case, maybe she isn't aware about it, but she is indeed kind of dragging you along. And you deserve better than that.

I think you should make a stand. She should respect your boundaries, but for her to do that, you should actually speak up to her. Tell her that you're not ""gay friend"" material. Tell her precisely what bothers you and that it's not necessarily because you want her like that, just that she still treats you AS A MAN even though you guys are just friends (because contrary to some people's beliefs, YES, genuine friendship between a man and a woman is not only possible, it is awesome).","1414800180"

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","You don't have to care about trends to recognize that there are public benefits to making vaping an attractive lifestyle choice. The tobacco industry is pushing hard for cigarettes as a lifestyle product and vaping as a healthier alternative to a lifestyle product, which perpetuates their sale as lifestyle and health products, respectively.

If there's one control factor in this debate it's that no matter how much the awareness of smoking's health risks increases, it's that smoking in some form is ALWAYS going to seem cool to teenagers—in the mind of a child, stigma and danger makes smoking more attractive. The only way to combat that psychology is to exploit it, by making vaping attractive and distance it from health.

As the industry matures, I've noticed companies put more stock into the utility of targeting different audiences with different marketing approaches. Unfortunately there is going to be some overlap as PVs gain their footing in the public mindshare, because the forums of discussion are simply too small for there to be a meaningful separation. I suspect that in five years that won't be the case anymore, and health-concerned consumers such as yourself and much of my family will be able to engage without having to immerse themselves in a vaping subculture driven by enthusiasts and technology.","1414800180"

The art in a manga is all about matching the story, in my opinion. It's about conveying a message, not about being as lifelike as possible. 

A particular case that springs to mind is *Shimura Takako* (author of *Hourou Musuko* and *Aoi Hana*) who draws with a very minimalistic, almost watercolor-like style. It's perfectly suited to the emotion-driven story.

Another example would be *Kengo Hanazawa* who draws *I am a Hero*, who managed to convey the personality of his characters really well with his drawings, while at the same time making an extremely detailed background that really shows how empty the world is.

I wouldn't claim that either of them is the 'Most Talented' manga artist, but they are definitely worthy of being called Talented mangaka.","1414800181"

"OrthodoxChristianity","t5_2qra3","&gt; I find it odd that Jesus who went to a temple in Jerusalem to drive out the ""money-makers"" for turning a house of God into a market place

How is this remotely comparable? As far as I remember, those people in the passage were making money for themselves. The Copts at the church you went to were, in all likelihood, raising money for their church. Running a church is expensive, and selling food to fundraise is a perfectly fine way to raise some money. Some weeks, we sell baklava at our church. It raises some money and no one is obligated to buy it.

&gt; but I couldn't imagine jesus or his disciples having food and yet force people that if they want the food that they would have to pay up or hit the road. 

You seem *mighty* judgmental which is far more un-Christlike than trying to raise money for Christ's Church. 

&gt; i didn't know where that money was going to,

I realize Redditors are not the majority of the Destiny experience, however, if you're on here posting about it, you're more than likely a more serious player than the average gamer which means these opinions should be valued slightly higher as the dedicated gamers are the ones who will continue playing this after new games come out. I know a lot of people who will be dropping Destiny for CoD and to a lot of them, good riddance, but to some, we will miss them as a community because they were valuable members of the game and were just disappointed/frustrated. Not everyone is going to love every game. Sorry, just won't happen.

Deej doesn't sit there with someone looking over his shoulder reviewing his replies before he posts. He knows his limits on what he can say and where he needs to draw the line and let the community speculate and make inferences. 

Just because he doesn't respond to every post doesn't mean he isn't reading more than he replies to. ","1414800195"

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","I will be honest: Your relationship with Liz started going at standard breaking points. You discovered that the ideal view you had of each other wasn't quite true. You discovered that you don't have as much in common as you think. You discovered that certain lifestyle choices of the partner grated you. 

On top of that it seems as if really you two had an open relationship where sleeping with friends and partners was equally acceptable. Awesome if it works, but not necessarily polygamy. 

Poly really just means that you can love more than one person at a time. Everything else is up to you. 

I'm in a closed Vee with my two men and we have plenty of boundaries. It wouldn't occur to me to sleep with my friends just to see what it's like and both of them are monogamous, so don't really care for extra partners. It works for us. I know a lot of poly people whom it wouldn't work for *at all*, but that is the beauty of the lifestyle. 

I feel you have now explored the two extremes. From free love to strict monogamy. Now your challenge is to figure out where you want to settle. Purely mono? A V, triad, quad, W or other exciting structure? May be hierarchical with one primary and some secondaries? I know I find the idea of hierarchical love terrible, but lots of people live it every day very happily. So even though I identify as poly, there are lots of poly set ups that don't work for me at all. I believe everyone should have the right to love how and how many they wish, but my conceptual approval doesn't imply I want to live it. May be you are in a similar boat. 

I would take this as a great new experience that has taught you a lot about yourself and how you want to love. Take it as a stepping stone to explore until you have just what you want. I think freeing yourself from the cultural norms and expectations and instead searching for what *you* approve of and what makes *you* happy is amazing and hopefully it will allow you to find happiness and love - even if you might end up full circle back in a mono relationship. Won't you appreciate that relationship so much more once you know it is exactly what you want?

A final note on the jealousy issue with partners of female friends. I have found that it is actually fairly independent of lifestyle and instead down to the individual. Some people just are possessive. In turn some people like their partners being possessive (some even thrive on the resulting drama which I will never understand). As long as everyone chooses the right partner for their level of possessiveness and desired possessiveness we are good. It's mismatches that lead to no end of trouble. 

Whatever you do, I hope you will find what makes you happy!","1414800196"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Yes, absolutely you can. Chapter 13 filing is reorganization rather than liquidation like a Chapter 7. 

If you have equity in your home and you file bankruptcy, you will need to make arrangements with your lienholder(s) to find a suitable long-term solution. This would usually be done through a loan modification which may require a loss mitigation process that needs to be approved by the court depending on which district you file in.

If you fail to hold up your end of the contract made during your bankruptcy, the lienholder may file for relief and attempt foreclosure which is an expensive and time consuming process. Due to this... most creditors would require for the regular monthly payment to be paid through the bankruptcy trustee so that if payments are missed your case will be dismissed and then they can proceed with any collection/foreclosure activities.

It all really depends on how far behind you are on your payments. If you are not behind on your payments and continue to maintain the regular monthly payment during your chapter 13 bankruptcy then there is no risk of losing your home.

So what? In the situation you're in now, any smart woman who is interested in you isn't **really** smart anyway. Until you fixed yourself, you are a bad choice.

&gt;No. I'm shit. I'm neither blaming others, nor ""the world"". I'm the problem.

Look for ways to make yourself better. Have a lot of light in your room/apartment/house or see the sun. It's much cheaper. A bit of light can change soo much. Eat to get energy if it's a good idea.

&gt;You're trying to insult me and telling me to stop ""whining""? I think you should look at your own behavior.

I'm not whining. I was in your spot, probably even worse. I didn't talk to anyone about this. I was there a hundred times in front of a passing train and thought of ""doing the step"". I was in a school yard with a cable around my neck bound to the basketball basket standing on a chair in the night. A kid even passed me at that time, not caring about anything, just on it's way home. I was on top of buildings, and I probably forgot a few other things.

&gt;Jumping in front of a train would fix everything, don't you think? I'm sadly to much of a pussy to actually do it. So I have to find another way.

You realized suicide isn't an answer? Good. You have to find another way. 

&gt;I can't even eat on a regular basis or keep my apartment clean and you suggest me to learn a useless martial art? With what kind of money would I pay the instructor? And why would I want to have contact with other people?

It sounds like a good idea to me to learn a martial art. And if there ever in the future is someone evil who creates suffering for his enjoyment, you are prepared. Some martial arts also are not only about fighting. And it's easy to avoid people, saying hello and all the other nice things can be just a ritual or tool to be treated better. Of course there are other ways to make a positive change.

&gt;Effort. Effort. Effort. I have no motivation or drive to improve anything and just behave like a potato. I stare at my ceiling and browse Reddit. Everything else is too exhausting.

Yes sometimes everything hurts, all the time. Nothing makes any sense and one has to create something out of the silly things that are there. Something that makes sense. Even if it seems that the time isn't right for one self.

&gt;I know I'm not worth saving. That's the whole point. Euthanasia is already a thing in certain countries. But it's like drugs. ""Legalize drugs? ZOMG"", ""Legalizing marihuana? Maybe we'll think about it"". People who don't improve society, 
are terminally ill or whatever else should be given a way to opt-out without traumatizing additional people.

You don't really need that. There are so many other things already that shouldn't be there. It's as if everyone tries to make everything even more difficult all the time for everyone.

&gt;You know you're in /r/suicidewatch and not /r/getmotivated? Do you understand the phrase ""I DON'T HAVE ANY MOTIVATION AND DRIVE AT ALL""? Obviously not. And obviously you have never been depressed since you confuse depression with bad mood.

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","Factory seams (flats) should be at minimum 10"" wide. As you're only trying to fill the beveled edge. Maximum of 12"" wide flats, some of that will disappear during sanding.

Butt joints should be at bare minimum 24"" wide, That's if it's a perfectly level butt. Any variation in height on either side should be busted out wider than the 12"" you're using. I've busted butt joints out 4 feet in the past to hide them. When I was done with it you would never be able to find that butt though, Even I couldn't after paint hit. 

Interior angles should be no wider than 4"" in my opinion. You're never going to make them a true 90 degrees. You're only looking to bury the tape and make it look like a tight corner. 

Corner bead when installed correctly on well hung drywall should only need 8"" of mud to be correct. Fucked up corners or badly installed bead may take this to 24"" or more to truly hide it.

Screws need a lot of coats for their size, It's somewhat strange honestly. When you coat a screw hole you always want to make it as small of an area as possible, You want to apply mud in the opposite direction that you wipe it, If you were to apply mud in a downward stroke and then wipe downward you're not filling the top correctly. Huge mistake most novice will make. 

Sorry for the rant, You're 100% right in your short statement comparatively. The more light coats you put on the better off you'll end up. You want a good solid fill the first coat. 2nd and 3rd coats will be significantly less mud used but are much tighter coats and only used to fill imperfections in the previous coat or 2. More time with mud equals less sanding. Nobody likes to sand","1414800204"

After I went back for a second look, it seems that Blizzard is trying to actually increase the amount of players at partner events. I think they are trying to promote WCS as the tournament series for the established pro and the partner events for those emerging players.

Take a closer look at the rules for the partner events.

You have to have 16+ players, but ones who did not qualify do not count towards the total. 

For the Global Qualifier:
Global Online Qualifiers must not have a cap or limit to players

players participating in all stages of the qualifiers cannot be eliminated from a single game loss

If Blizzard's format works well, we could actually see more entrants and partner events in the SC2 scene. This means two things; more sponsors because of more events and more chances for amateur players to get sponsored or sign with a team. ","1414800209"

The mana is much better than jeskai and getting ahead on mana will usually win that match up for you. Abzan can definitely be hard to beat when they are drawing gas, but what matchup would be bad for them with multiple rhinos hitting the board? The counter magic is efficient and does a good job protecting your multitude of threats as well as your life total from the burn spells.

"math","t5_2qh0n","this is a functional differential equation. If k is positive, it's an advanced differential equation and if k is negative it is a delay differential equation. I'll take k negative for the following discussion, just for convenience.

These equations are infinite dimensional because in order to solve them, you need an initial condition that is a function on, say, [k,0]. 

This is linear, so that's good. There are an infinite number of linearly independent solutions. They take the form e^(lamda x) where lambda solves exp(lamba k) - 2 - k lambda = 0. There are infinitely many  lambdas that solve this. (lambda is complex)

g = 0 is still a solution if k=0

You can solve this with the method of steps if you wish (though it's cumbersome and you should probably just do it numerically). For example, if w: [k,0] -&gt; R is the initial condition, then we can find a solution on [0,-k] by solving

w(x+k) - 2g(x) - kg'(x) = 0 with g(0) = w(0). Easy!

Let w1(x) be the solution on [0,-k]. Then we can find a solution on [-k,-2k] by solving

w1(x+k) - 2g(x) - kg'(x) = 0 with g(-k) = w1(-k). And so on... I'm assuming k is negative, remember.

If k is positive, the same idea applies, but you march in the negative x direction.","1414800211"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Doesn't LA also have one of the most abusive police departments?

Totally off topic. I used LA as an example because it used to have such bad smog that they had air quality advisories. Through California enacting strict emissions regulations, that problem has largely gone away. Though you thinking getting a jaywalking ticket is abusive is kind of amusing. Trivial or not, you were breaking the law.

&gt;So the problem is that politicians up until now haven't known what the proper amount is to punish companies financially? How do you think that will be rectified?

The problem is that politicians haven't actually been trying to punish companies for their wrongdoing, but have been giving them slaps on the wrist to avoid widespread riots. This is how [one congressman](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rep-joe-barton-apologizes-to-bps-tony-hayward-for-white-house-shakedown-video/) reacted to the BP oil spill. And that's not going to change until we fix campaign finance laws and stop letting these big companies pay off members of congress to avoid responsibility for their actions. I mean hell, oil and gas companies have gotten exemptions to [EPA regulation of their waste products](http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/industrial/special/oil/)

&gt;Wastes generated during the exploration, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas, and geothermal energy are categorized by EPA as ""special wastes"" and are exempt from federal hazardous waste regulations under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).","1414800211"
"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm guessing you mean that Summoners aren't part of ""Runeterra"", but are part of the League of Legends mini-verse? (Because I really hope you aren't planning on inserting a completely different rune-mage concept and then rebranding those guys as ""Summoners"". That'd be worse than the status quo of abandonment.)

If so, by the way, I'd like to push for an end to the erasure of all Summoner references in voicework. If we're still Summoners in the game, then let us be Summoners in the game.

***Only you can hear me, BLUE TEAM PLAYER #5.***

I mean, if you guys want to go make a new Leagueless Runeterra lore-verse, I guess that's your prerogative…but it does leave the game League of Legends itself without a story, bringing the whole endeavor strangely full-circle. I don't see much harm in creating a little mini-verse of League of Legends lore that includes, well, a League of Legends.

I really like the idea of Summoners. Not all-powerful creepy puppetmasters, but ""radio support"" for Champions, mages who back Champions up in a fight and guide them with advice. It also gives VO some potential for dialogue: what a Champion might say to their Summoner opens up a new set of possibilities that complements the smaller category of what they might mumble to themselves. For example, are they a sinister spooky monster who will try to menace their Summoner? Are they a haughty warrior who will warn their Summoner that they better not screw up their Flash? Or are they a cheerful sort who will urge their Summoner to stay positive?

I also like the concept of the League itself, a sort of ""fantasy Babylon 5"". It opens up some interesting diplomatic and political story-space, and provides a convenient way for Champions from far-flung regions of Runeterra to interact. Just like Summoners shouldn't be all-powerful puppetmasters or slave-drivers, the League shouldn't be some independent hegemon that uses unlimited magical power to enforce its will on the nations of Valoran. Rather, I see it as a sort of EU, or perhaps a Supreme Court: it holds power because the states of Valoran have formed a consensus that they'd rather have a referee for their conflicts, peaceful and otherwise. It can't stop all wars, nor is that its core mandate: its most crucial mission is instead to prevent conflicts from escalating to world-destroying Rune Wars. (In this framework, Kalamanda was a dramatic story of brinksmanship, a game of chicken with horrifyingly high stakes: the League put all its chips on the table, using force to temporarily halt the fighting between Demacia and Noxus, gambling that this break in the tempo, combined with an implicit ultimatum, would prevent an apocalyptic clash of superpowers.) As such entities often do, over time it's expanded its portfolio to become a forum for non-military conflicts as well. It's fun to watch Piltover and Bandle City Champions slug it out in a fierce competition for prestige, or some other stakes, but it'd be weird to have them actually trying to murder each other. Consider the wonderful A New Dawn cinematic: its humor relies on the context of the League, which explains Katarina's ""woooooooooooops"" expression, as well as Graves' shrug and smirk, as he catches her off-guard.","1414800212"

"homeland","t5_2smlq","I'm completely confident that Aayan is an agent of ISI's, and he's playing Carrie.

Thanks to Aayan, ISI has eyes on Carrie at all times, and they can use him to detain Carrie from carrying out important tasks, such as authorizing drones and following up on important tips in a timely manner (like with Saul).

I think before Carrie showed up, ISI had complete control/knowledge of every move the CIA made in Pakistan, likely thanks to a mole. Carrie was a wildcard that ISI didn't anticipate, so i think they've made it a top priority to know everything Carrie does in order to ensure that she doesn't interfere with their plans.

The writers seem to be trying to get us to think that John Redmond is the mole (the guy who was supposed to be station chief), since he's constantly tailing Carrie everywhere she goes and he seemed strangely interested in helping the Ambassador with her drunk husband (ISI's newest asset); however, i believe that's a red herring.

I don't think Redmond is the mole because Redmond was the one who told Carrie about the underground exit in the embassy, so she could come and go in secret, and in a later episode you see Tasleem (the ISI agent lady) behind closed doors asking one of her men to find out how Carrie is leaving the embassy without them knowing. Redmond was also the one who gave Carrie the name of the ISI ground agent, Farhad Ghazi, and he was a local mercenary who Carrie may have never found otherwise.

So I wonder who the actual mole in the CIA is. I'm also still curious why Aayan was delivering meds to Haqqani, and what the meds were. I wonder if the meds are some kind of sign that Haqqani and the ISI are lying to Aayan in order to make him more wiling to spy for them. Maybe they want Aayan to think he's helping his uncle in some kind of David vs. Goliath fight against the CIA (like how he says his uncle beat the soviet union), when really his uncle is working with ISI (a Goliath themselves).","1414800216"

Corporations rightfully stay out of drama. It's better for them. That is the reason advertisers are pulling out is because they don't associate with the movement. They are neither for nor against.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","We're on the same page, buddy. I was more trying to make the point there has to be a better way to provide secure elections more accessible to all. How long do we keep going with allegations of voter suppression and manipulative politics? Forever? Your article even states the ineffectiveness of voter ID laws.  
&gt;We also find that one of the favorite policies advocated by conservatives to prevent voter fraud appears strikingly ineffective. Nearly three quarters of the non-citizens who indicated they were asked to provide photo identification at the polls claimed to haves subsequently voted.  

Obviously secure borders will help this (among other things) and it is inexcusable not to do so because no election should be swinging on the votes of noncitizens.  Which, to the articles credit, may very well have happened.  However, half the article is devoted to describing the limitations of the study.  
&gt;We analyze only 828 self-reported non-citizens.  

OK, so in extremely close elections - two in this article - unregistered voters could account for wins by Democrats based on how the 828 people surveyed responded.  I would not call that widespread voter fraud and using it as an argument against some form of secure, mass ballot distribution as an improvement to our current system doesn't hold up. ","1414800219"

The monster would probably have to be able to reach level 4 if more hunters are in the game or even have two monster players. The maps may have to be a bit bigger as well for this mode with two teams/two monsters.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Right. With big data, it is almost impossible for humans to search through raw data and expect to find a pattern with any significance. Instead, smart people create programs that constantly index the data and utilize pattern recognition algorithms. The computers work 24/7 to allow the user to search for specific patterns that return associated values. 

That being said, these patterns are formed by probabilistic algorithms using machine learning. After all the Snowden leaks became public, there was outcry from the government saying that fallout from open knowledge would prevent the agencies from thwarting terrorist attacks. While officials justified these big data programs by attributing to them the thwarting of around 50 terrorist attacks, more leaked reports demonstrated that the NSA exaggerated and more conventional means of acquiring information were used to stop the attacks.

Back to your question.  Can we sift through the conversations? If they are all saved in raw form, sure. Can we narrow down using pattern recognition  / filtering? Yup. But even doing after all that, is the program justified if the data cannot be efficiently processed and analyzed to stop terrorist attacks? To me, it seems that the government use scare tactics and fear-mongering as an excuse gobble up as much data as possible and find the needle in the haystack. The agencies might be more accurate and efficient if high valued networks were systematically targeted to locate and analyze relevant information.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; In my opinion, Greg's actions are completely within the bounds of ""Natural Rights"" and the motto that ""Your rights end where my nose begins"". Moreover, Greg's actions are also completely within the bounds of the ""Non-aggression Principle"". Greg is free to do what he wants to his own property. He is free to shut down or refuse service to whomever he pleases. 

I'm interested in hearing some *actual* libertarians respond (I am not one), but I do think this is a dubious interpretation of the NAP. Greg is basically knowingly committing premeditated genocide. The fact that its ""his property"" seems kind of a technicality that I'm skeptical even hardcore libertarians would adhere to. I think there was clearly enough of an implicit agreement in the use of the elevator to justify the tenants using force to escape, or to hire a third party to ""negotiate"" their extraction.","1414800228"

You may also need to differentiate between what humans think a leech is and what a tracker thinks a leech is.  To many people, a leech is someone who hasn't shared back his fair share of data.  To a tracker, however, a leech is simply someone who does not have a full set of all the files in the torrent.

&gt;If they weren't tax-free, there wouldn't be.

Maybe not. In my opinion, make them pay taxes like everyone else, and if a church can survive, great. If not, then that's just how the cookie crumbles. I'd make an exception for historic churches/synagogues/mosques/temples though. We as a society have an obligation to maintain those. 

&gt;Sure.  Add one more step to the ""beginning"" question - an unprovable, and unreasonable one.  Some thinking being MUST have created it, right?

Not necessarily. I believe in the Big Bang Theory. There may or may not have been a cosmic entity behind it. My beliefs are always science-oriented though. Science comes first, and any belief I have about a deity must fit in accordance with the scientific explanation of the universe. 

&gt;Hatred is a word describing a feeling, and is a terrible example.  If a god of any sort were real, and in any way affected reality, it COULD be proven.  Not that it would be right now, or any time soon, but it COULD be.

But how can you prove a feeling? If I told you that Henry hates Tom, how can you prove or disprove that? You can't. So, assuming that there is a cosmic entity, a deity that affected the universe at its conception, how would you prove that? At least with today's technology. I agree with you that if a deity exists, it could be proven at some point in the future. 

&gt;As if 'intolerance' was the thing to avoid.  I thought it was being fucking delusional that was the bad thing.  Tolerance of delusion isn't a virtue, it's a cop-out.

Why do you care if someone else wants to be delusional? I went to school with a kid who believed in Santa until he was 15. He wasn't hurting me by believing in Santa, so why would I show intolerance towards him? I can disagree with a belief and still tolerate someone. 

&gt;And since their actions are informed by that Christianity, they're doing the world a disservice.  Period.

They don't vote based on Christian values, they're not intolerant of anyone, so they aren't hurting anyone. I don't agree with their religious beliefs, but I'm not going to disown them for it. 

&gt;If they took the time to actually think about things, maybe they wouldn't believe in falsehoods?

I agree. But they don't question things, they're still stuck in the 1960s in some ways. They don't even go to church, they just believe in Christianity because that's how they were raised, and they prefer not to question things. But as I said, they tolerate my drastically different political and philosophical views, so I can tolerate theirs. 

&gt;Opinion:  The conclusion one has made between reality-based options.

&gt;Delusion:  The conclusion one has made based on fictions.

What do you call a belief founded on a concept that currently cannot be proven or disproven as reality or fiction?

&gt;*My only issue with this frame is the integrated seat clamp. It’s the worst thing ever. I have heard about this the clamp issue on Aventon frames for the last year or so and now I experienced it first hand. You really can’t get the thing tight enough, so for the first couple of rides, my seat post slipped and slipped and slipped again (hence the scratches on my carbon bro). Once I finally found the sweet spot and got it tight enough (you really can tighten the clamp for a good while), a new problem has arisen. While the seat post won’t slip, the clamp actually comes off the frame. So, you hop on your ride and what do you see? The damn clamp rising off the seat collar, creating a gap between the clamp and the collar. Not very pleasing to the eye and more frustrating than you can imagine, plus the thought of a seat post snapping in half while riding is not pleasant. This is their 2nd frame with this issue*



Leader is great, little issues here and there but they usually revise them, and they have great customer service. Only downside - and this is something i hear repeated often in this community - they are too overpriced for what you're getting.



I love my Unknown Combat, it's responsive and really light, looks beautiful, and all of the components on my complete that I got for it were top notch and perform way beyond my expectations, one of the best bikes I've owned. That said, customer service is absolutely abysmal. It took them a little over a month (they stated 7 days) to get my bike. Gaps of no responses, both phone, and email, while they did respond swiftly when they were around, when they weren't, it was hopeless. The bikes can be hit or miss though, but they've revised models with faulty functions, like the LV1 having bad dropouts, or the Singularity having wonky aeroposts, I've not had any issues with the combat, and the ps1 is pretty amazing too.","1414800241"

Journey Through Time lets you explore any area of Switzerland, from any time period mapped at any scale. It allows you to search, to animate through maps from different times, and to compare maps using an innovative overlay technique that fades one through to another using a simple slider control. Metadata is rich so you can easily identify the map and some of its background information. You can link to a specific map for sharing and also print out a full extract. As an example of a rich portal into national mapping this is beyond compare. As examples of design it’s tough to beat too.

The use of colour in particular has always been a characteristic of Swiss topographic mapping. On many map series (particularly the 1:100,000), colour is used to vary label meaning, show quantities, represent or imitate reality and to decorate which visually enlivens the map.  The Swiss “style” is well structured, maintains uniformity, uses white space effectively, contains beautiful typography and unrivalled depiction of relief on topographic reference maps.

The typeface sets a classic tone using primarily ‘antique’ looking serifs that includes a unique combination of thick and thin strokes.  Hill shading on most series and scales is in the classic Swiss style based on the work of Eduard Imhof.  The maps are rich in content and deliver complex information in a succinct, well organised manner. [[Full Article] (http://mapdesign.icaci.org/tag/relief/)]

With Skulker in my hand, I played it that turn, next turn I got 4 1/1's on the draw then attacked with both ordeals for 4 more 1/1's, and then drew four for 8 more 1/1's, hitting for 17.

"OpiatesRecovery","t5_2tkk8","I hate suboxone because it developed into a stronger dependency than I ever had with heroin, both physical and psychological. It robs me of my personality and makes me feel like a zombie. My tolerance is so much that it doesn't help my cravings and im still using the heroin. I know these are issues I need to work on and that I can't blame it all on the subs. However it doesn't help me and has made my life really difficult and depressing. I feel like my doctors and reckitt benckiser misled me about what this drug was like. i remember the term ""miracle drug"" being thrown around a lot. You cant convince me that what theyre doing is ethical.  My first sub doctor was operating a pain clinic and killed several patients with absurd prescriptions. I showed up for my prescription one day and the DEA had shut them down, forcing me to relapse. My next doctor heard i was trying to get off of it and took advantage of my desperate state to increase my dose by TWELVE TIMES. he had no sympathy for how it made me feel or understand that someone might not want a lifelong dependency. My current doctor is not a bad guy but doesn't care about anything besides his money. The whole thing is a big racket, and they dont give you a parachute, preferring to keep you on it for the rest of your life. working on getting off now but its a HUGE struggle. I would have been better off had I never got on this nightmare of a drug.

I have serious qualms with the whole concept of opiate maintenance treatment. Naltrexone makes way more sense as something to stabilize you while you work out your issues. Suboxone just made me accustomed to taking opioid everyday just to function, resulting in a MASSIVE psychological dependency.  You can argue that I didn't work my program well enough, but I seriously doubt its ability to do anything to assist you. Get off the illegal drugs and get a state sponsored addiction to line our pockets. What about keeping yourself sedated is supposed to help you overcome addiction? I needed to deal with my cravings, not give in to them. If you can detox off your DOC, I don't think maintenance will help. At the very least it should be short term

Sorry for being so verbose, but I get really passionate about this issue. I honestly feel that it robbed me of my humanity and left me a broken shell of who I was. I know that sounds dramatic,  but I struggle to believe I am going to successfully kick this.  ","1414800246"

Yes, Wizards gets nothing from the secondary market, so why would they care if they tank a cards price? The decks are being sold to retailers, Wizards makes their money no matter what. It's up to the consumer to decide if they want to pay above MSRP.

Prices may be inflated for the entire decks, but they will drop too. If Wizards knew they were going to include chase cards in each, they sure as shit would know to print the hell out of the decks so there isn't the same issue as last year. ","1414800248"

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","I'm probably not the best person to ask about video games being a legitimate target for a feminist critique. Here's why: 

I grew up playing Super Mario Bros. on Super NES and trying to save Princess Peach only to find out she was in another castle. It's a VIDEO GAME! In no way did I ever relate this to real life and think that I needed a man to come save my ass because some giant meanie named Bowser kidnapped me. 

In addition, I played Tomb Raider. I never wanted to be an archaeologist, but I respected her even though she was built like a barbie doll. I'm not, by any means, the target audience of a game like tomb raider. More men play it then women, so the developers wanted to make it appealing to men. It was still fun to play. 

As far as games like Grand Theft Auto go, I'm aware that there are hookers on the street, and that it looks bad for women. It's part of the game narrative. If you don't like the game narrative, I'd suggest you don't play the game.

Edit: Don't know why I'm being downvoted, you can Google it for yourself, the cards need 28A each, therefore his power supply doesn't provided the amps he requires. Also, Google Nvidia's power requirements and you'll see that you need minimum 500W for just one card..","1414800250"

I'm sorry but why the hell does this matter? You can do the exact same thing in attrition just with complete freedom when it comes to where you want to go. 

LTS and MfD sure can be hectic, but most LTS matches won't be 3 vs 1, most LTS matches that I play is me rallying the less experienced players to hold back a little and play tactical instead of rushing into the center of the enemy titans. It doesn't get hectic 90% of the time. To me it feels like playing CS:GO, just with titans. 

MfD is also hectic but either it goes well and everyone on your team has a good laugh, or it goes down frustration lane, with your teams marks dying in 5-10 seconds and their marks already sitting in their titans when they are chosen. Sure it is fun hunting and being hunted.

I don't see how the enemies can be such more of a challenge considering that they are the EXACT same as in attrition. Heck, with the new ranking system you meet better players in attrition although half of them run SP.","1414800254"

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","Depending on how ""out there"" your ideas are, you might already have everything you'd need with the Eventide open-platform DSP/H/Orville series:

* [The ""Wall of Real Tides""](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/attachments/electronic-music-instruments-electronic-music-production/390925d1395603895-i-have-joined-cult-eventide-h3000-wall-tides.jpg) 

From that picture, everything that's not either an (a) Eclipse or (b) an H3000-series has that open architecture I'm talking about. You can even do some pretty deep programming with it (though you won't have to write anything from C/C++/Java etc.). There are hundreds of modules on there, with which you can build your own algorithms completely from scratch, and have every option you'd pretty much ever want/need. When assembled with VSig (Eventide's algorithm-building software), the algorithms look like this:

* [Italo de Angelis - Crosstapsdelay](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/attachments/so-much-gear-so-little-time/414800d1408773233-secret-way-amazing-fx-multitap-delay-multitap-dly.jpg)

*(full post [here](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/so-much-gear-so-little-time/949884-secret-way-amazing-fx-multitap-delay.html)--check it out, it's an amazing read!)*

I don't have one of these yet, but I have been learning how to program my [Lexicon PCM80](http://www.hugeracksinc.com/forum/download/file.php?id=3952) (and its Pitch algorithm expansion card) for the last 6 months, not only for the Lexicon's unique sounds (especially its reverbs!), but also to prepare myself for something that's basically a totally open architecture, like the Eventides. The Lexicon is not an open-architecture machine, but its algorithms are VERY powerful. They usually look like this:

* [PCM80 Glide&gt;Hall](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0nfRNg2RTEBUERMUzV3akhxUE0/view?usp=sharing)

* [PCM80 Pitch Card - Quad&gt;Hall](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0nfRNg2RTEBcmRmaWNqQTFrTEk/view?usp=sharing)

I'm also learning this for all the modifiers--LFOs, ASDRs, latches, waveforms, dynamics (for effects that respond to the input volume), etc. which are all ""par for the course"" on the big Eventides. So far it's been a very worthwhile investment ;)  

Just curious, what kind of effects are you thinking about making? I'm still very much an amateur at this kind of stuff, but I might be able to help point you in the right direction. Maybe even tell you if what you're envisioning can already be done on the hardware that's out there! I wouldn't really put *anything* past the big Eventides, to be honest--their machines are so powerful and so wide-open, I highly doubt that even the people who designed them know half of what they're capable of.

**EDIT1:** forgot to mention, there's also KYMA, which is a newer open-source platform for audio processing of all kinds (including effects). Don't know much about it yet but I hear it's amazing! 

**EDIT2:** I remember you! You were the one who made the post about the dynamic/pitch-shifted/modulated reverb thing a few months ago--did you ever read my [response](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/2c9i1q/rebel_technology_this_company_will_make_you/cje85jt) to that? It can be done!

I've been telling everybody for a while now, the future of guitar effects started in 1994! (when Eventide released the first open-platformer, the [DSP4000](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2MlgxNjAw/z/o-UAAOxyVLNS4a~T/$_57.JPG)) Basically, any ""weird"" effects you can dream of can already be done with these, and they've only gotten more powerful over time. 

Anything you can dream up is in that box! ","1414800260"

Yes, I'm being a bit hyperbolic there...but only a little bit. The great thing about Aliens is it's totally different from Alien, but still fits with it. The Alien franchise is a lot like Hellraise in the sense that once you get past the initial offering, things get wonky. Alien 3 and 4 aren't great, but are interesting from a perspective of getting more lore about the universe. AVP 1 and 2 are dumb, but I enjoyed AVP 2 in a so bad it's good way. I'm with you on Prometheus. The movie makes some odd choices, but the overall narrative, characters, and feel of the movie worked for me. One of the best things about the Alien universe is how they portray future technology, and Prometheus certainly didn't disappoint in that sense. I'm really curious to see how they make a sequel, because I just don't see how you continue this thread of a story. Have you watched the making of documentary of Prometheus? It's something like 90 minutes long, and is just fascinating. It was on the special edition blu-ray, but I saw it streaming online someplace awhile ago. It's realy worth tracking down. 
 

I'm definitely excited to get to Isolation sooner or later. I just want to play it on a next gen console, which I don't have yet (my PC can't run it). But please believe I have plans to rewatch the movies and play Isolation whenever I finally get stuff together to play it.

You need to fix this man. You could just clean your diet up a little bit and that may work for a while. Only way to be sure you are getting getting the right amount of calories to steadily lose weight is to track them.

This also gives you the power to make small tweaks and observe the effect it has. For working out your macro's have a read through [this]
(http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=156380403)

TL;DR

- Accurately track calories and macros. Do weekly weigh-ins and make adjustments till you find the point where you are slowly dropping fat.
- Set minimum protein and fat limit per day and make sure to hit them. Rest is flexible but fibre for digestive health and carbs for energy are recommended.
- If your strength starts to suffer then slow the weight loss down by upping your calories, or maybe just drop the volume a little bit.","1414800262"

The big bonus for the crockpot for me is that you don't have to worry about keeping up with water evaporation...  Many times I've gotten busy with other things and ruined or almost ruined a pot of beans because they got two low and burned to the bottom.    

I freeze the cooked beans in incriminates of 1.5 cups (the equivalent of one can of beans) with some of the cooking fluid added back to protect from freezer burn. Cool them completely, and put them in a ziptop freezer bag and freeze flat. 

I used to use plastic containers, but freezing makes them super brittle and they ended up scattered in the depths of the deep freezer due to being harder to contain... I now have a bin in my deep freezer that I stand the flat frozen bags up in once they are frozen.  ","1414800262"

Mistakes in programming are inevitable and every possible scenario cannot be accounted or tested for. The hardware is also designed by humans along with the machinery it controls. In other words nothing humans make is 100% perfect and therefore completely safe. The advantage a human has with direct contact with the systems, ie the pilot, is that they can think, process and find solutions that are outside of the box. Something a computer algorithm can't do at the moment, (i.e. intelligent and self aware computers). In other words, the human, even with their built in flaws is the last line of defence when the system fails, allowing you, the travelling public, the best chance to get home to be with your family.","1414800269"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","1) By far the most common high-production-value video people see is Hollywood movies.  Hollywood has been stuck for decades in a very, very old standard for projectors that mandates 24fps.  No one wants to upgrade because it would be too expensive for both the studios and the theaters.

2) Newer, low-cost, low-quality recording tech can easily do 60fps.  The vast majority of 60 fps video people see has been recorded by amateurs futzing around.  School plays, random fun times, sporting events.  The only TV events that use 60fps video are sports and live-action reporting.

3) Soap operas liked to save money by using cheaper, 30 or 60 fps cameras.  In contrast, high-end TV dramas decided to shoot at 24fps to emulate the feel of Hollywood movies shown on TV.

So, because of quirks in history, the production value of any video you've ever seen your whole life has almost always been inversely correlated with the frame rate of that video.  Most people don't think about this fact consciously.  They just see the video that gives them a certain feeling that associates the video with high or low-end stuff they've seen in the past.  That's why they say ""This 60fps crap looks like a high school play!  But, the same content at 24fps looks like a Hollywood movie!  Give me 24fps!""","1414800273"

""Explain why we're out here again please?""  Said Gareth.  This did not garner a response, so he cleared his throat and spoke with more authority this time.  ""Bill!  Seriously!  What the fuck are we doing out here at this time, on this night?""  This seemed to provoke a response.  

""I told you last time.  We are not to talk of this in the open."" Bill rasped.  ""You have your weapon, keep it at hand.  Until you have to use it, keep your damned trap shut.""  The sound of a branch broke against the silence.  ""The fuck was that?"" Gareth hissed, to be met with a very abrupt ""SHHH!"" from Bill.  What was that?

Amongst the shadows and silhouettes of the moonlit grove, moths and fireflies danced among the twigs and trees.  Gareth thought this was a very peaceful moment compared with their trek so far.  He drunk in the moonlight, and sipped the musky autumn air.  ""We got away!"" he thought to himself, pleased as punch. 

There was a slight stirring behind him, he assumed it to be his faithful hound, Harley.  He crouched to greet his faithful hound, but his mouth was bloody...  His eyes dark...  His grin showed too many teeth.

Buddy. Holy shit. Ever heard of using evidence? Sometimes really stupid people need to have things spelled out for them. If you read and understood the dictionary definition, you'd see that I used it completely appropriately. But I know reading and understanding things isn't your strong suit.

Here's the thing. Try and follow along. I used sarcasm in my post.

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just listen and enjoy the music. Please read this entire reply - we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) If you are planning to submit your own music in listentothis, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit.](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Violating these site-wide rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about, and how we operate. Keep in mind, if you haven't got anything positive to say in your comment, it's best not to say anything. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely.

New users must maintain a minimum level of positive community contributions to submit music links in listentothis. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of 50-100 submissions each day. We can't tell you what this score is. We can only tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote music in listentothis without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links.](http://www.reddit.com/advertising) These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes. Everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit faq.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq)

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** listentothis is not the place where you want to submit your first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are however many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you, who will give you feedback and advice, even technical tips, on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*
* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources, they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in listentothis, and prove that you are not a spammer. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers. Thank you for understanding, and good luck in your music career!

The main issue is, that you don't have a winning condition. You are too slow to outrace (too many big cards) and you have not enough villains to reliably block the opponent. To improve this deck I would put at least another playset TMs (better 2) in (probably Manticore or if possible of course any villains) and probably also switch to Maud since AJ is pretty weak right now. Moving his friends away won't help you much, since moving them back costs him pretty much nothing. It is only effective if you combine it with a TM. You will still struggle vs. aggro and be quite a bit away from competitive (since NMM is one of the most important cards to make orange viable), but I think that this might help at least a bit.","1414800286"

"rement","t5_2w8i8","Oh boy. Where to begin with this one! I think, of the sets I own, my most hated set might bet the swinging/dancing food set. This one: http://rivetart.com/resource/image/toys/cropped/rementdancefood3.jpg

I bought 3 of these as blind boxes. The tea cup is okay, but they are all WAY too large and not detailed. The shrimp/tofu set it just blegh (though the gold pot is okay, I guess) and that pile of spaghetti? awful and huge and horribly painted. They actually turned me off from buying rement for a long time because they were my very first sets.

A runner up might be set #5 from Kawaii kitchen (probably because its one of the ONLY sets I've been able to hunt down should've been an indication as to its wide availability) http://rement.iamneverbored.com/089.php

It was a LOT larger than I thought it would be, I broke the ""chip clip"" within minutes of opening it thinking that it moved (it doesn't move). The pink basket is weird and not so nice, and the cookies/chips are all singular pieces. 

As a ""theme""- I'm not a fan of the cake series, anything clothing, and 99% of the characters stuff. And I'm assuming we are ONLY talking about miniatures here because don't even get me started on the stickers, keychains, magnets, or other massively boring crap that Re-Ment produces. I really don't like my food to have eyes. All I want is normal, straightforward tiny food that looks just like it's ""big"" counterpart-- doesn't need to have Disney characters or smiley faces on it. And exception to this is the Toy Story birthday set, which I really like EXCEPT for those solid plastic barrel o' monkey piece which *SHOULD HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUAL ONES* (more than one at least). :)

This helps overcome the feeling of being deprived and with social events.  Leptin is the hunger controlling hormone, and I think that it should instead be considered the anti-starvation hormone.  Usually overweight people have plenty of leptin in their system but have receptor issues.  I can understand how eating at periodically lower calorie levels might cause a lowering of the leptin threshold, but I don't yet understand why carbs are required in the process.

Eating once a week at maintenance level is not cheating.  Eating 150g carbs is cheating on the keto diet and is not recommended and not supported by other mainstream Doctors touting the keto diet.","1414800291"

LeBron comes out strong to make up for last night, and Love plays well. I think LeBron goes off for more than 30 pts and 10 assists, while Love has something like 25 pts and 15 boards.

Kyrie, on the other hand, is completely neutralized by Rose.

The Bulls' front line and the second unit do whatever they want. In the first half, Pau and Taj put up at least 12, and Rose and Brooks are able to slash into the lane. In the second half, the Cavs bigs are in foul trouble and fatigue starts to kick in from going back-to-back. As the Bulls begin to punish them inside, the Cavs defense collapses in, allowing Buckets and Mirotic to spot up.

LeBron does his best to keep it close, BUT the Bulls put the game away with a few minutes to spare, and the crowd gets Big Macs. Beep beep! Drive home safely, folks.","1414800294"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","&gt; Setting up a working desktop takes 20 minutes.

Exactly. I've installed a few times (old laptop, new laptop, old workstation, new workstation) and now I do the same thing (except I add `vim`, `firefox`, graphics driver and a few others). Then in the chroot:

* add my user account
* `systemd enable gdm.service`
* configure basic things in /etc (keymap [dvorak], timezone, hostname, etc)
* install bootloader

Then reboot and log into `gnome`!

This ends up being about as fast as installing a pre-configured distro like Debian or Fedora, but I end up with only the software that I want. Also, since I don't have tons of extra software starting up on boot, I get to a `gdm` login in 3s on my SSD, which is pretty awesome.","1414800297"

For a significant portion of their slump at the beginning of summer, they picked a significant amount of Mundo and Eve, which weren't working but they just kept picking them week after week.  Later in the summer, for some reason they kept forcing Quas onto Lulu and that cost them the 3rd place at worlds.","1414800301"

There is no easy way to quantify any of that so spend some    time reading the conversations we have with each other, ask questions in threads that catch your interest.

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","Another key is to anticipate the next checkpoint well in advance. A good racing line is the only way to consistently get to the head of the pack. Don't weave from one ring to the next, find the straightest line that intersects them all. The checkpoint area is very generous, so travel in a straight line as much as possible. This is pretty much the most important thing to do.

Use long, slow movements that don't cause the instructor to wobble the plane and waste energy. Avoid hard rudder turns, they're energy-inefficient.

Anticipate the behavior of other planes in the pack. If you're coming up on the inside of a turn, and there's a plane next to you on the outside, expect them to turn into you and go below or above them instead.

I see some people doing a sort of ""dolphin"" maneuver, diving down on gates and then climbing up. This will *not* give you more speed in the long run. 

If the next gate is below you, only dive as much as is necessary to hit it. Doing hard dives not only wastes your energy due to maneuvering losses, you will lose all your accumulated energy in the climb back up (no, really, you will, it's physics!). Do only long, shallow dives as much as possible.","1414800313"

Those two were mil-spec, fully proven platforms known to perform reliably in combat conditions. They're also 3MOA rifles out of the box. Many are certainly more accurate than that, but the DoD considers 3MOA acceptable.

There's a market for over-equipped douches who think things equate to status or anything meaningful; and there's a market for people who just want to own nice things with an ownership status attached. And there's always the minority of the market, of people who genuinely require the quality delivered by premium brands.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I'd like to clarify a few things:

1. I'm not saying that C is the best language to use in all circumstances.
2. I'm not saying that C is the best language to use in *any particular* circumstance these days.
3. I love many languages, and feel that each has a time and a place where it is appropriate. Many have many times and places where it's appropriate.
4. The purpose of this post is to celebrate the fact that C was an influential programming language that helped the computing industry grow beyond what it was in 1970. Languages that did not exist in 1970 are, for all intents and purposes, outside the scope of discussion.

Now then.

&gt; and back then I would have easily chosen assembly over C.

Which assembly language? There was at least one per CPU architecture, of which there were many popular and competing ones. The Intel 8086 didn't exist until 1978, so back in *1970* didn't even exist.

&gt; Any language is viable for OS dev.

Possible != viable != good. There are many languages that existed at the time that you could write an OS in, but they either were slow (such as lisp), or cumbersome to work with in regards to large programs (such as many forms of assembly).

Many languages were fast *enough* and beautiful for the time (again, such as lisp), and the speed could be improved by making hardware that was designed for the language (once more, such as lisp).

But that meant you couldn't have your OS run on general purpose hardware, and could not easily port it to new platforms. And if you could, it would not run nearly as well as you'd like it to. Thus, it was viable, but not good.

&gt; There are already OSs in Java, C#, Python, JS, LISP, Smalltalk, Haskell for example.

Of the ones you list, these are the ones that existed in 1970:

1. Lisp
2. Smalltalk

Yeah, that's about it. I'm including Smalltalk because it came out the same year as C, and development on it started the same year development on C started.

However, Smalltalk worked similarly to Java in that it compiled to bytecode, that was then interpreted/JITed in a virtual machine. Because of this, it ran INCREDIBLY slowly on 1970s hardware, and was not viable for any real use at the time - especially with operating systems.

&gt; Yes, I know you (whoever's reading) doesn't like one of the languages I named for some reason,

I absolutely love the design of the C# language, as well as Python. Those two are some of my favorite languages (only considering the languages themselves), but they're certainly for different purposes. Another of my favorite languages is C++, but I have to admit that C does not make the list.

&gt; but the point is that you obviously don't need C to program an OS.

Eh... Don't *need*, but it's handy and arguably better. Do you see any of those languages being used to implement an entire kernel that can run programs at nearly the same speeds as other OS kernels? Probably not. If you do, then you're probably talking about Haskell... Which didn't exist in the 70s.

&gt; You seem to be one of those people that think C is deterministic and therefore the only way to program an OS.

What? Not at all. That doesn't even make sense.

&gt; The obvious problem with C is that it introduces tons of vulnerabilities and is slow to (re)program in.

Depends on what you're programming. If you're writing a program that's designed to allocate memory for other programs to use, I'd be willing to bet that such a task would be even harder in most languages - especially since you need code to run as fast as possible, and thus you don't want unnecessary bounds checking.

Besides, you're working with the entire address space anyway; you're writing a system that adds bounds to something without bounds to begin with. You want bounds checking on some operations, but not on other operations. And unless you have absolute control over when it does and does not occur, you're in for a world of headaches and cheap hacks around the algorithms the language uses in the background.

&gt; Just add bounds checking and you've fixed most of the problems,

lol

&gt; but Mr. Hardcore UNIX (TM) programmer over there will tell you why that's horrible for performance

Especially for things like video games and web browsers.

&gt; and no user would ever want an OS that doesn't crash/get owned every day.

More like, ""And no user would ever want an OS that freezes everything on the system for a few frames every time any space in RAM is allocated or deallocated, which is constantly in most every-day applications.""

Yes, you *could* do it, but performance would be abysmal. It's easier and performs better if you add the bounds checking when it's appropriate, and leave it out everywhere else.

At least, in the OS itself. Each application doing its own bounds checking every time, that'll be fine since it won't cause problems in other processes.","1414800316"

I don't really blame you for not understanding. For one thing anything about the great depression will have a political slant as the great depression/world war 2 is where we start ""modern"" history. For another thing the great depression is not one event with one cause. It is the name of a particularity rough era of about a decade. America wasn't really plunged into poverty over night and it wasn't taken out in one presidential term. There was a ""great crash"" which is often all we think of when we think of with the depression. To over simplify, the stock market was doing great and both the government and the privet sector wanted more people to invest so banks started telling people that they didn't even need to pay for stocks, they could take out loans (much like the 2008 house loans) to pay for stocks. People would then use those stocks as equity to apply for more bonds to buy newly mass produced luxuries such as vacuums. So Joe would go to the bank with very little money and they would give him a lone to by stock. The next day Joe goes to the bank asking for a bigger loan and says that if he fails to pay they can just take his stocks from him. Anyways people started to realize that don't have the money they are giving out and they ran to with draw their money only to find the banks lent it out and the person they lent it to was never able to pay back. A lot of people lost all the things that they never really owned. A lot of banks went bankrupt as did business. One of the competently unrelated causes I mentioned was tariffs. The United States set tariffs so high international trade stopped completely. In the short term this helped the economy but in the long term the prices went way up and when other nations followed suit manufacturing started hurting.This is a small cause that aided the great depression.

If you feel comfortable playing Faceit/wanting to get better and willing to pay for a subscription, try out esea. Give it a month try if you can, cancel if you don't like it. I would recommend being around DMG in MM, because Esea is full of mostly DMG+ players. Honestly only get Esea if you're a dedicated player, you'll encounter a lot of ""Elitists.""

I learned a lot about the game by playing Esea, the shit that works in MM and Faceit doesn't always work in Esea. You will get stomped and you will stomp. You can get SMFC and GEs on your team or get Rekt by them. Getting Rekt by people in esea is different than in MM, I feel like I'm always getting ""gayed"" in MM while in esea I can usually pick out my mistakes. 

I quit playing MM(only played it with friends) for a month to play esea. My subscription ran out and I ranked up from MG2 to DMG in MM.

I don't plan out dialogue either, I just end up re-writing it several times. 

If you are having trouble, try acting it out. Incorporate body language and facial cues. Remember, the flow of dialogue :

""Statement,"" said Character.

Physical reaction, ""counterstatement.""

Reaction always comes before speech. Also, people speek in shorthand. That means contractions and abrupt informal statements, not long flowery words. 

Lastly, if there is any hint of uncertainty, always, always use a dialogue tag. It is a huge disruption to the readers flow of consciousness to get confused about who said what. Remember ""said Character"" is invisible to the reader, there is no harm in using it too much.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","'Three notches down' is working under the guy who makes engineering decisions, and not being the guy who makes engineering decisions. This is a big, complicated design project for a high-profile client. I see leading the the design on a project like that to be where I should be. There is precedent within the firm for someone with my experience and credentials to do that. 

One notch down would be leading the project with frequent check-ins from the boss, or bringing him along to meetings to chime in as needed. Two notches down would be leading the design on a smaller project. Three notches down is being asked to tag along and follow. That's what I'm expected to do.

What I've done thus far to try to turn things around was state my objection through the official channels for doing so: at my performance review. I'm interested in ideas on what else I should try.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","&gt;This is about completely destroying the concept of absolute poverty.

And with destroying poverty, you also destroy the possibility of wealth. Making every single person mediocrity middle. Without bad there's no good. Without poor there's no rich.

If you give people free money, the people who *only* have the free money are the new poor. The economy will shift back to the same scale.

&gt;Also know as late-game capitalism.

I fail to see how late-game capitalism prevents me from finding/owning a piece of land, and not having to pay 9million different fees for running a business. I can't simply say ""hey, I'll give you $x amount of money if you come work for me"" and then just build a shop on my property. Nope. All sorts of restrictions. Want to sell food? Tough shit, gotta go through FDA and stuff. That's not capitalism. If you think it is, we have differing views of what capitalism actually is.

Please give me your description. Here's mine: an equal opportunity to freely trade tokens of worth with no restrictions.

As it stands, we are *far* from that currently. Once you introduce a body that regulates that statement and says what you can and cannot do, you no longer have an equal opportunity to freely trade with no restrictions. Which is where we are currently at.

If we *do* have an equal opportunity to freely trade, why must I pay some random group of people an arbitrary amount based on how much I earn? Why is that group of people then keeping it, and giving it to the super poor? That's not equal opportunity? Where's *my* free money? Hell, why not just *their* money and give it to me? The problem, of course, is that you can't give *everyone* free money. Doing so simply causes inflation. And of course, with a distributor of free money, there's room for corruption.

Either way, it's entirely against capitalism, even *if* it's 'fair'.

&gt;Capitalism is inherently flawed and based on exploitation of everything and everyone that a business owner decides.

Considering everyone's a business owner, I don't see how this is a problem.

&gt;The most successful businesses will always end up being the ones that are more willing to clamp down on any start-ups and put them out of business. 

Yes, and those successful businesses were also startups. As it stands, there's room for more than just a single monopoly. There's been almost 0 cases of a ""natural"" monopoly. Every single large business has been government funded. That's not capitalism. Capitalism is ""back in the good old days"" when mom/pop stores were a thing. *that* is capitalism. Granted, taxes still stray from the pure concept, but it's closer than what we have now.

&gt; From there, regulations are formed to protect society.

Again, straying from capitalism causes problems. These regulations *harm* people trying to make money for themselves. Making it harder to start businesses. And make it harder for big businesses to fail, since they employee all the average joes.

&gt;Eventually, government sees the benefit they can get from businesses and businesses advertise and network well enough that those regulations turn in their favor. 

Yup, and protecting big businesses allows the average joe to keep his job. Once again, straying even  further from capitalism.

&gt;Not putting regulations would only make the systemic collapse happen sooner, though I agree that's the better alternative to being stuck in this fucked up country right now.

Not putting regulations in would cause large companies to collapse. It's happened time and time again. Large businesses aren't sustainable in many cases. And a small guy could easily come in and crush them, provided there aren't regulations.

Look at IBM vs Apple. Myspace vs Facebook. Yahoo vs Google. Amusingly, all of those were in the unregulated field of computers. Capitalism at it's finest. Company gets big, some small guy crushes them. We end up with superior products. Yay capitalism.

Now look at the medical industry and financial industry. Companies get big. Government helps them out and makes it too expensive to join in (regulations). No little guy can come and crush them due to the regulations. Big guy fails? No prob, just bail him out. That ain't capitalism.","1414800322"

That's fucking absurd.  We stereotype so bad.  After 9/11 muslims were clearly discriminated against.  During the Cold War, anything with 'socialist' in it was literally a witch hunt as COMMUNIST.

When the trend of child abuse priests hit its peak, so many priests were discriminated against.

It's a merger of mentalities.  It's stereotyping based on characteristics, mixed with the ""Well, it's just to be safe.  If I avoid *ALL* muslims/priests/black people/gay people I'll avoid any potential problem that can rise from them.""

The mentality that even though some will be unfairly discriminated against, you protect yourself from those that would cause damage.

"Machinists","t5_2s1ie","Let's see...

- Barely anyone in this country (United States) knows what a machinist is/does. I have been asked if I weld as a machinist, if I work with wood, if I build houses, and the list of ignorance goes on and on. I literally have to show them a piece of bar/round stock and then the finished part for them to even get a little bit of a clue. 
- The best they can go off of is the movie ""The Machinist"", which shows the worst possible scenario and extremely dirty working conditions. It's not all like that these days and the idea of a machinist being an anorexic nightmare doesn't help (thanks Christian Bale...)
- The media and institutions shaft our existence as well, if not paint it in a bad light.
- We deal with LOTs of numbers. Numbers that are always changing. We are expected to deal with numbers down into the thousandths and even into the tenths (and maybe 10 millionths and millionths) and deal with tolerances in those ranges on machines that vary in condition. All I know is that chess masters lose their mind after a certain time, and they deal with a lot of numbers/scenarios.
- It can be nerve racking when proofing a new program, especially on lathes with tooling right up next to the chuck. 
- A single number can ruin your day.
- Having to deal with engineers ""who claim to be smarter than you"" even though they push 6 place decimals on blueprints, no understanding of tolerances at all and they don't include them and add impossible to make radii and cuts because Solidworks defaulted to it all.
- Your boss/bosses have no clue what you do, and quite a few of them enjoy taking credit when you do well and easily throw blame when you don't. Some even think the machine can just run itself and the idea of your existence on his/her payroll is a burden on them somehow. 
- Knowing what quality is from a machinist standpoint sucks currently due to picking out the horrendous quality and life cycle of products coming from China. When your boss demands the best quality possible and the world around you doesn't care at all, let alone sees it can be troublesome. We now live in a world of planned obsolescence which is a complete rejection of precision and quality. 

I could go on, but I think I'd rather have a drink. :P

NOTE: As for alcohol and weed, as soon as it gets past company doors, it's a bad idea. I find that running a machine on anything is plain awful due to the cost of tooling and the danger aspects involved. Leave the drinking and smoking until after work/when you are not on the clock.

The level at which people experience memory loss varies widely and is not tied to one's ability to act or consent at the time. Some people experience black outs at relatively low intoxication levels while others can drink to the point of alcohol poisoning and remember everything.

Not being able to remember consenting is not lack of consent. Please reread the standards I listed. You would need to not be able to communicate (could not speak where others can understand), not be able to physically leave (can't stand or walk), or unable to comprehend your surroundings (responding to questions when asked - like in your ability to carry on a conversation example). While memory loss can occur in conjunction with these items, they do not always coincide.","1414800328"

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","Hey, that's what I use! 

Here's my advice: on Windows, the properties for the mic are stupid by default. Find the mic in recording devices and go the the properties and turn of AGC (which stands for automatic gain control, it ends up distorting your audio a lot) and change the quality from CD quality to DVD quality. 

Also, and I've heard this is Windows 8 specific, but I'm not sure, without AGC on it's super quiet by default and it helps to turn the gain way up in Audacity or whatever you're using. 

Also also, I've basically always kept the switches on the both on the right settings (so -10db and bass reduction on), although it may help to switch it to 0db if you're recording with multiple people who are further away from the mic. 

Overall I've been pretty happy with the mic, but my audio before I figured out how to configure it was pretty bad. Hope this helps!","1414800328"

Of Labor's average salary for those classifications. So if rates increased employees got a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) Personally, I've only seen a 2% increase due to COLA since I was hired in 2008, while at the same time I've seen great increase of 1.5% increase in my retirement contributions.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","Ok, I'll read the article and see what to make of it. Perhaps it does go more indepth about the funding disparities between male- versus female-lead projects that might elucidate somewhat on whether or not the existing ""system"" is just (in the sense of providing the room for women, collectively, to eventually move into a position in which they are as likely to receive funding for a particular project as a man). If it is just in this way then men simply have a head start and we might in time see women form their own powerful networks in the future and/or making themselves a greater part of the currently male-dominated ones, thus leveling the funding-gap.

I at least trust the aformentioned article goes deeper than just throwing more numbers out there that essentially all point to the difference in funding for women from the VC community relative to the crowdfunding ones. Because I thought your excerpt was quite clear that female developers had an increased likelyhood of getting funded on the crowdfunding platforms mostly (if not solely) due to the efforts of gender activists looking to ""smash glass ceilings"" and whatnot, thus rallying behind them by providing monetery support. That seems as a plausible explanation to me anyway. But I'll read the article some time later at any rate, see whether it contains eye-opening facts or ideological sewage. The latter of which seems more likely considering the scientific rigor one typically finds when looking a bit closer at ""Women in the first world are suffering from x, y, z. Reform ugently needed!""-type of research. Which I gather this is.","1414800329"

"basque","t5_2u3rw","There are many Basque folk artists, I'll try to name some of the best known ones.

**General folk music**

*[Oskorri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atyp4AxGjzg&amp;list=PL66365F337413FA84)* is widely known and has published a fair number of albums. They mainly sing ""modern"" versions of traditional Basque songs, but also have many self-produced songs. 

*[Alboka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDda0tsdG14)* is another one, with a lesser variety of songs than Oskorri, but much more folk-oriented. Their name comes from a traditional wind instrument called alboka, which is widely used in their songs.

*[Kepa Junkera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHcLXVJXFjg&amp;list=RDtHcLXVJXFjg)*, his songs are mostly self-composed and instrumental-only, and he uses mostly Basque traditional instruments, such as the trikitixa and txalaparta.

*[Hiru truku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlVrHMe7zNw&amp;list=PL-UgBsCDVpsj9MN1xF_5F-6PDrGA8ouWF)*, traditional Basque songs and poems, focused mainly, but not only, on Biscayan folk.   

*[Alaitz eta Maider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfiCKwJhfp0&amp;list=PL45B39A5C4400CE42)*, a female duo. 

*[Tapia eta Leturia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kx_iVp7smg&amp;list=PLx56Xxy3a0JD1xsSfdp5DeyrHEMyJkCOb)*, nice folk songs sung mainly in different Basque dialects.  

**Classic songs**

This may not be folk per se, but are either historical or classical songs, and have a big role in the Basque identity.

*[Hegoak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHYOm4WjzLE)* is a traditional Basque song, very popular in the northern Basque Country. 

*[Txoria txori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NW7CZxOxhI)*, a version of Hegoak by songwriter Mikel Laboa, very, very famous. If you could, you should check the rest of his songs, they are all very good, all with similar tone and some are very revolutionary (politically). 

*[Oi ama Euskal Herri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZc_rvQt93E)*, by Benito Lertxundi. He is a very well known folk songwriter. I recommend more songs from him. This song in particular is sung in Souletin Basque, which makes it even more special.

*[Gernikako Arbola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDJ4wHDGi0k)*, by Iparragirre, almost a Basque anthem. 

That would be pretty much it, I left out folk Basque dances, but if anyone's interested I could post them too. ","1414800330"

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","&gt;So you think game journalists shouldn't cover salacious email bullshit? Because then you're saying they did the right thing by ignoring the Zoe Quinn story. 

I don't think journalists should cover the personal lives of other people. So in this case they were right for not covering the Zoe Quinn story. However, I hold journalists to higher standards when it comes to consistency. You make a choice, as a website, about covering or not covering the personal lives of gaming journalists/developers and then you carry out that choice equally. In the case of the gaming press they decided to lower themselves to in fact cover the personal lives of gaming related people, as they did for Brad Wardell, Max Temkin, Josh Mattingly and Laura Kate Dale. So when Zoe Quinn happens and they don't do it then there's a problem of lack of internal consistency, at the very least.

&gt;But that's not what that list was or what it was for.

It doesn't matter what it was for. The leaked e-mails showed they were talking about the Zoe Quinn story and whether they should cover it or not and that some of them even wanted to send her gifts.

&gt;A journalist who would report on the salacious details and rumors about a minor player in their industry are not behaving in accordance with the very code of ethics you say you want sites to adopt! It's crazy.

Shaykh Muhamamd ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about celebrating Mother’s Day and he replied: 

All celebrations which differ from the Eids prescribed in Islam are innovated festivals which were not known at the time of the righteous salaf, and may also have come from the non-Muslims, in which case as well as being an innovation (bid’ah) they are also an imitation of the enemies of Allaah. The festivals which are prescribed in Islam are well known to the Muslims: they are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the weekly “Eid” of Jumu’ah. There is no other festival in Islam apart from these three. All the festivals that have been invented apart from these are to be rejected because they are innovations and are false according to the laws of Allaah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected,” i.e., it will be thrown back at him and will not be accepted by Allaah. According to another version: “Whoever does any deed that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.”","1414800338"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;You keep circling back to netflix here, but do you really think it'd be different if it were any other massive bandwidth hog?

Yes, it would be different, but not really in a way that matters. It's a monopoly issue with Comcast, both as a video media provider *and* internet service provider. They have monopolized multiple markets, and may charge above competitive prices for access to their customers, whether it's for Netflix services (which they have extra incentive to overcharge), or some other massive bandwidth producer. Frankly, it doesn't matter who they charge, Cogent or Netflix. The customer will pay the fee. And if that fee is not competitively priced (because Netflix or whatever big bandwidth company only has Comcast to do business with), that's the definition of anti-competitive, monopolistic market conditions.

&gt;As things are, as I said earlier, this is just the latest battle in cogent's war on having to pay for their massively lopsided traffic flows.

If you think this is just about fair pricing still, I don't know what to tell you. I can't decide if you're uninformed or literally astroturfing me right now. Either way, you're on the wrong side. This is monopoly market manipulation, plain and simple.

"dotamasterrace","t5_2z18c","I was inspired to make this post because I just finished answering that same question.

Here:

&gt;I'll give it my best shot.

&gt;During TI2(that game was Game 2 of the Finals of TI2, IIRC), there was this 'unstoppable wombo-combo' which was the Naga Siren Song of the Siren(puts everyone affected by it to sleep for 7 seconds, giving time to set up) into the Dark Seer Vacuum(pulls everyone into a single location), then a Tidehunter Ravage(~2.55s stun that does a lot of damage). Essentially, you'd Sleep a whole team, Vacuum them into one spot, stop the Sleep, and then Ravage, stunning the whole team and then you just clean up. Guaranteed 5 man Ravage and teamfight win. 

&gt;In The Play, Na'Vi destroyed the combo, like, completely destroys it.

&gt;IG went for a wrap-around gank through the river for a backstab, and Dark Seer uses Surge(makes Naga move at max speed) on Naga to get her in position. Naga uses Song of the Siren, and makes the whole Na'Vi squad go to sleep. The rest of IG come in, and position themselves. Dark Seer Vacuumed everyone in, and Naga cancels the Song. The second she cancels it, Tidehunter Ravages.

&gt;Here's the unbelievable part, the part which makes this to be considered The Play due to its sheer skill and outplay.

&gt;Ravage can be countered with one item(or certain skills): Black King Bar, which gives Magic Immunity(Spell Immunity now) against Ravage. The key is to activate BKB faster than Ravage, so you don't get stunned or take damage. Ravage also has a slight animation time, meaning you can get the BKBs off, or do some other things, but the margin is extremely slim.

&gt;When Tidehunter Ravaged, a few things happened:

1. Enigma(LightofHeaven) BKBed, so Ravage didn't stun him
2. Rubick(Dendi) Force Staff'd out of Ravage range
3. Juggernaut(Xhvost) used Bladefury, which makes him spin and do damage, as well as give him Magic Immunity like BKB does.

&gt;This meant that only the 2 supports, Enchantress(Puppey) and Shadow Shaman(AA) got hit by Ravage. 

&gt;The instant after the Ravage, these happened:

1. Enigma Black Hole'd, and hit 4 people(everyone but the Lina), pulling them in and doing damage as well as a ~4s stun.
2. Rubick disables the Lina by using Telekinesis(an instant disable which lifts the target into the air).
3. After Rubick disables Lina, he instantly uses his ult, Spell Steal, to steal Ravage from Tidehunter. This gives Rubick a copy of Ravage.
4. Juggernaut goes to the center of the Black Hole, doing damage with his spinning.
5. Before getting disabled, Lina manages to cast Light Strike Array(the orange bright spell in the center of the Black Hole), but it only stuns the supports, Enchantress and Shadow Shaman, because Enigma and Juggernaut are Magic Immune.

&gt;As Black Hole was about to end, this happens:

 1. Enchantress uses Mek to heal her team
 2. Shadow Shaman uses Ether Shock(an orangey spell) to do damage
 3. Most importantly, Rubick uses Ravage against IG, doing tons of damage and stunning them.

&gt;All of this results with a full HP Na'Vi team, while everyone but Lina on IG are dead. Lina(ChuaN), tries to run away, but is killed by Na'Vi who proceed to go and take the barracks.

&gt;The reason why this was so amazing at that time was because no one could beat the Naga, Seer, and Tide combo. But Na'Vi do it in a spectacular way. The amount of coordination, teamwork, and individual skill to pull of a play of that magnitude was unbelievable. 

&gt;This is the reason that its hard for LoL players to understand why its so amazing: **They have nothing that can recreate a play like that.** All of their spells are instant cast, so impossible to dodge if chained perfectly. They don't have BKB to stop big CC(Crowd Control). Their stuns last for, at most, 2s and only on very special champions. No champion can steal a spell. Unless its a skillshot, spells will follow you to the ends of the earth, making it nigh-impossible to dodge. That's why they praise individual skill more, because the game itself doesn't allow the ability to produce a play of that level. The game simply limits a team from doing anything overtly spectacular, because it must appeal to the masses who(lets be honest) will never be coordinated enough to do something like this.

&gt;Hope I've cleared things up, and its not too confusing. If someone could double check and help me, that'd be great.

&gt;Oh, and also, to put things in perspective, IceFrog nerfed the Naga, Seer, and Tide combo after TI2 by making it so Dark Seer could not Vacuum during Song of the Siren. That was how OP the combo was, and yet Na'Vi beat it.","1414800338"

If you are really Pro-Life then you have a self-proclaimed vested interest in the life of that child, not just its birth. That includes financial support until that child is an adult and can take care of itself.

This is not the case. The ""Pro-Life"" people just want to force religious views on all women and control them.

After the birth they want nothing to do with the child or the mother. ‘God forbid’ their tax money being used to help raise the child they so vehemently wanted brought into the world.

They want to force women to go full term because, in their minds, the woman sinned. She had sex (usually out of wedlock) and now must be punished. That punishment entails 18 years of being responsible for a child, that in many cases, she is not financially ready to support.

It’s an Iron Age misogynistic view of women that they are trying to force on half the citizens in this Country because they were born female.


edit:

Also, if they believe that their god controls everything then I guess it would be futile to point out that [""as many as 50% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage -- most often before a woman misses a menstrual period or even knows she is pregnant.""](http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/pregnancy-miscarriage)

If it's taking forever for him to spell out how he's killing people EVERY time, you can have him write it down in notes, or you can approach him out of game and request that he save the murderporn for important plot points, (basically, cut down on the number of enemies he's using to display his characters sociopathic tendencies.) 

For point 2) Yes - I've always implemented rules to encourage my players to think of their characters as people and not video game characters.

"Pathfinder","t5_2qyq5","If you're playing an archer, then the Deadeye Bowman trait is always a good idea to consider. Ignoring cover from one creature will let you actually make use of your bow for the many many levels before Improved Precise Shot becomes available.

I wouldn't multiclass your bard - once you start dipping into other classes to improve your archery, you'll wind up in a spot where it's the bard levels that aren't helping you.

You obviously have to have Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot just to make archery function. Arcane Strike will get you some bonus damage in exchange for your swift actions. Rapid Shot and Manyshot will let you get that bonus damage more times per round. You probably don't have sufficient accuracy to go for Deadly Aim, so don't worry about that, but Clustered Shots to punch through DR is helpful, even though you won't be able to get it until ninth level (eighth if you retrain into it). Just those basic functionality feats are probably going to require every feat you get through to at least 9th level. Weapon Focus might be nice if you can find a way to get it in there as Bards don't have as good of self-accuracy-buffing as most other 3/4 BAB classes.

Otherwise, I'm not sure why you would get that message on a file import, it's never happened to me before.

The multiple entries per day is likely because ACT renames the log file if it is over 64MB by default.  Multiple files seems unusual though - would you be willing to .zip one up and send it to me via email?  it could be that you are just running a ton of zones/combat, but if there is an error filling up the file, it would be better for me to fix it.

The multiple files may be what is confusing ACT about HistoryDB, so you can turn that off by changing the threshold  for when to switch files.  It is on the Options Tab -&gt; Miscellaneous, it defaults to 64MB.  try changing it to 500.

But even then, if we ignore them not seeing that particular aspect, THEY STILL GET IT WRONG. This isn't remotely about social justice. This isn't remotely about keeping the gaming market as it is - to the contrary, it tells us that the gaming market, as it is right now, and as it develops right now, is shit. Sure, it attacks the typical casual gaming on mobile phones and Facebook, and lets say we ignore the most recent studies that women still make up a fairly large part of the core market, not just the casual one, then this is STILL also about those casual elements spoiling core gaming as well. Quicktime Events. Auto Aim. This attacks stereotypical dudebros who have invaded gaming, playing CoD on their consoles, trashtalking, as much as it attacks the ""stupid mobile gamers"". Considering that most of the GamerGaters are actively opposing any higher, more thoughtful sort of gaming, the dumbed down shit is the only thing left for them. In other words, this comic attacks GamerGaters, who seem to be fine with the current state of gaming as much as it attacks casual gamers. That might be the whole point here, to show that ""casual"" gaming isn't just Bejeweled and Co but any sort of gaming trying to appeal to the dumbed down mainstream.

"podemos","t5_31h78","Pero si es muy fácil. los de izquierdas tenemos cuernos y rabo, nos comemos a los niños y quemamos iglesias.

Los de derechas van a misa y son buenos.

Si es que complicais las cosas.

Pero en los últimos 100 años ha aparecido nuevas formas de entenderlo:

- Centro: O sea Derecha.
- Ni de Derechas ni de Izquierdas: O sea Derecha
- Social-liberal: O sea Derecha.

Alguno pensará que soy un radical extremista dogmático de izquierdas (o sea con rabo y cuernos), pero ni por todo el oro del mundo (eso que aprecia la Derecha) estoy dispuesto a renunciar a identificarme con las luchas del pueblo (o sea la izquierda). Desde Espartaco a las luchas obreras del siglo XX, llegando hasta las mareas del presente, yo tengo claro donde está la izquierda.

Porque al final, el viaje al centro de la izquierda nos lleva a justificar que la distribución injusta de los recursos es admisible. O que la desigualdad de oportunidades ante la vida es admisible. O que el enriquecimiento de Felipe González está justificado. No estás de acuerdo con que existan privilegios: eres de izquierdas.

Si me usan eso de ""Podemos no es de izquierdas ni de derechas"" para justificar que no participemos en una protesta (ha pasado en mi círculo) pues el que lo dice es de Derechas. Si un señor dice: ""yo llevo el carnet de Podemos en un bolsillo y en el otro el de PxC (xenofobos para quienes no los conozcan), pues es de Derechas.

Otro tema es el mal uso de las etiquetas, y que algún ""desubicado"" piense que por ponerse la etiqueta de izquierdas ya lo es. Gran parte de los miembros del PSOE, pero también de ERC, ICV e incluso algunos de IU, no merecen llevar la etiqueta de izquierda, porque es un insulto a los muchos que han luchado, han padecido el exilio, han sido torturados o ultrajados, por ser de izquierdas. 

Así que pasamos de ortodoxias, de ismos , de definiciones que nos limiten , y en eso estoy de acuerdo. Pero si olvidamos que somos pueblo (o sea izquierda) , que somos la voz de los desfavorecidos, y empezamos a tomar decisiones ambiguas, estamos perdidos. 

Mirad el programa de las europeas, es un programa de izquierdas, sin ambiguedades. 

¿Qué somos? ¿Leones de izquierdas o huevones de derechas?

The image has inspired a lot of art, and has shown up in a number of really weird places - from posters, to graffiti, to tattoos. For the past few years, my friends and I have been collecting pictures of all the places it's shown up - this is an album of some of our favorites.

If you want to cut your carnitas with some definitely not-dry or too-salty pork, just forget the ""low and slow"" thing entirely. Buy some cheap pork (2lbs to add to 6lb might be good) and cook it like a nice pork chop. You know, hard sear, cooked just to temperature. Juicy as a motherfucker, even if it might be too tough to eat normally. 

I would make a few cuts while it's resting (because you aren't going to eat it like a nice pork chop), and make sure to reserve the liquid. Let the pork cool down, and then put it in a food processor until pretty finely chopped, but not mush at all.

Add to the carnitas that was too salty, and then mix in the reserved liquid. I think the textural contrasts would go well. Not better than good carnitas, probably, but a good fix.

Chop the pork into the chunks to get more searing surface area, if you nasty. ","1414800368"

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Okay, I've dug up [this episode](http://daclips.in/fjkcj1luw81a). You're going to have to sift through the advertisements in order to watch it. Don't fall for the ad that tells you that you need Flash. Click the blue 'continue' button. 

First example I would like to point to is located at 10:15, when he discusses using a shock collar with the dog. His teaching principles apply to all tools, including nail clippers and other grooming tools.

""Right now she is in a comfortable state. This is a good time for us to put any tool, especially since we don't have any food. So, the affection becomes the reward. We want her to associate the tool with something positive.""

""We don't want to use the tool right away. We want her to wear and feel comfortable about it.""

These are the *exact* training methods that everyone says he doesn't employ. Yet there it is.

At 24:25, you can see of bit of the method that I presume you are not a fan of. He takes a dog that is afraid of walking out on a walk. The dog puts up a bit of fight, but Cesar continues on. I wouldn't say he ever ""drags"" the dog, though. I will let you judge. After a while, the dog has overcome his fear and is ready to run.

In the 3rd story of the episode, we see a dog that is very fearful of an air compressor in the garage. The *very* first thing Cesar does, at 40:15, is use food to invite the dog into the garage. Once in the garage, more treats. Turns on air compressor. More treats. Again, he employs positive reinforcement.

The man has a beautiful wife and a beautiful daughter; _one_ of them sneaks into Oswald's room -- but which?

"law","t5_2qh9k","It must be nice for PDs to have that built-in excuse of being able to blame the system for anything.  Where even honest mistakes (like misspeaking at a trial) aren't analyzed as ""misconduct"".  Where there's no accountability or downside to trying to break evidentiary rules or shirt around court orders at trial.   Imagine if a prosecutor or cop said he or she was just too busy and underpaid to ensure defendant's constitutional rights aren't violated.   There are brilliant PDs, they are good PDs, there mediocre PDs, and there's downright shitty PDs that violate their clients rights by failing provide competent representation.  There's also some counties with more systematic problems, but usually you can find plenty of brilliant PDs in those offices as well.  

Your second paragraph is another blanket statement that just isn't true from my experiences.  I've never seen a prosecutor stat sheet, though I have no doubt they exist somewhere.  There's brilliant prosecutors, good prosecutors, mediocre ones, and shitty ones, and up and down that spectrum, there's ethical ones, ones that tow the line more than they should, and a few that are truly unethical.   

I think there's a lot of motivational rah-rah stuff at some PDs offices that creates these blanket mindsets of thinking - it's never your fault, it's always someone else's fault, you're all heroes and fighting for good, and all prosecutors and cops are evil and corrupt.   It fires people up and gets them to work, I guess.   But there are real individuals making up all this, and thousands of different office cultures. ","1414800373"

It's not really a practical book, but it will help you understand the importance of habits and why you should work on them. 

Examples of keystone habits are pretty much what you said: Exercise, Sleep, Diet. But there's also, Meditation, Cleaning, Socialising. All these habits designed to make us feel better, and also lead to a chain reaction of even more benefits when done consistently. With habits like these, you make it easier for yourself to do other things you want.

Suddenly removing this element would be going in a seemingly very different direction to what their idea was.","1414800378"
"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","I have three recommendations

1. Keep reading and watching tutorials. Even if they are boring or seem to be things you already know, you may learn ""basics"" of which you were unaware and would have accidentally skipped if you stopped reading. For example, in JavaScript, basics like understanding `this` and the basics of prototypal objects can be overlook very easily. Accidentally skipping them can set your understanding back. Some sites for this include: 
  - [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com) -- not to be confused with code academy
  - Google+ communities -- G+ is filled with Programmers and articles, My personal favorites include: [Javascript](https://plus.google.com/communities/100875929141897651837), [NodeJS](https://plus.google.com/communities/115365528781941125390), [AngularJS](https://plus.google.com/communities/115368820700870330756), and [Web Dev](https://plus.google.com/communities/114175980151299757659)
  - and of course YouTube and Vimeo recordings of lectures at conferences and meetups.

2. Pickup a framework. I know many will tell you that **pure JavaScript** is the best and nothing will beat it - same goes for all other languages - but a framework will kickstart you into a direction. While it is true that some frameworks are ""better"" than others, and it is true that somethings are more challenging with frameworks, it is also true that going in ANY direction is better than puttering around unsure of where to go. Also, opinionated frameworks have strong writings on what is the ""right"" way and what is the ""wrong"" way to write a code. While many will say opinionated is bad, it too provides structure and helps you start out. Any framework is good, but I recommend Angular personally. Here are links to tutorials
  - [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js)
  - [Angular Main Tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial)
  - [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/)

3. Find a need in the lives of you or someone who's close to you and try to fulfil it with a project. For me it was a program to produce college tests at random. I had a girlfriend teaching Japanese and she spent hours making versions of the tests she handed out. she randomized the same questions and their respective answers and set the answer keys for each. So I wrote a Japanese Kanji, Katakana, and Hiragana friendly ""Test Version software"" and would constantly check it met her needs. I tought me PHP, templating, Database connectivity, Security Authentication, PDF generation, and a framework (CodeIgniter). It took forever, 6 months, but I finished with with wonderful syntax, structure, Object inheritance, and took samples to all my first job interviews. They were delighted to see my clean, readable code and loved that I had a real project to show them. Using a fake project, just to do a project, never produces any real results because there is no real need. Find a small need and fulfill it.

Now I work for University of California Irvine, School of Education, as an application developer. Before this job I worked from the ground to lead developer in charge of new developments for a CMS company making jewelry websites. I developed and maintained and wrote new features for the core.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","There once was a man named Romeo Crennel. When Reomeo was just a little boy, he asked his father one day, ""Father, how do you be good at your job all the time?"" And his father answered, ""Son, what you ask is impossible. Only be good *sometimes*, and you shall never want for a job.""

As Romeo grew up, he pondered his father's words. What did they mean? When did one know when to be good at his job? How could one only be good some of the time and not all of the time? Well, Romeo went to college and played football and got a job as a graduate assistant. All the while he meditated on his father's words. Eventually, he rose to the ranks of defensive coordinator. There, he discovered that the best way to do his job was to say ""Yes, Mister Belichick. That sounds like a good idea,"" as much as possible.

Well Romeo managed to win three championships with the New England Gr8riots. He was bemused, knowing that he had put forth little to no effort to win these prestigious games. All he had to do was show up to work. Could this be what his father was talking about? After many years in New England, he got a job coaching the Cleveland Browns. Now, instead of letting others do the work, he had to actually put some effort forward! What a change!

Romeo was fired from the Browns. What happened? Didn't his dad give him the right advice? He worked hard to be good some of the time... Well anyway he got a job with the Kansas City Chiefs. Unfortunately, his head coach was nothing like Belichick! He was a creepy hobo named Hayley. Yuck! Hayley got fired and Romeo got handed the head coaching job for the remainder of the season. There, he managed to retrain the Super Bowl champ Packers into his own personal bitch. Amazing!

He was allowed to keep the coaching job through the next season. But wow! The Chiefs were the worst team in the NFL! Oh no! Well, Romeo was fired. Later, the Houston Texans hired him because of course they did. There was a great young player named Jadaveon Jokeguy. But wait, he played defensive end. Romeo knew he had to mess this up as quickly as possible.

So he moved Jokeguy to linebacker. Finally he understood his father's words. He would only be good some of the time. Romeo smiled to himself, already looking forward to his next job.","1414800379"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Uh, Mara didn't ""decide"" the penalty. He's the chairman of the NFL's Management Council Executive Committee, which also includes Goodell and 9 other owners.

What happened was Washington and Dallas (as well as Oakland and New Orleans) dumped some long-term contracts into the 2010 season, which is something the NFL told them not to do. Basically it was an agreement between the owners to have the 2010 season not actually be uncapped, which Snyder and Jones violated. They lost cap space over the next two seasons and the amount they lost was spread to every other team aside from Oakland and New Orleans (who made less egregious violations, but didn't lose any cap space).

Basically two teams that are known for giving out bad contracts tried to fix their shit using the uncapped year to the advantage and the rest of the owners were pissed about it. That Mara was the chairman doesn't make it some weird conspiracy, since 28 teams didn't go against the ""rule"".

I mean, we can talk about how the owners basically made an agreement so they wouldn't have to deal with a crazy uncapped season, but to pin it on Mara trying to get some kind of divisional upper-hand is downright conspiratorial.","1414800388"

"aviation","t5_2qhu8","Most of the time these sorts of things are done just in case, its in a country's best interests to know just how long it takes a (potential) enemy to respond to your aircraft, what kind of aircraft they send and so on. The US does this sort of thing to, or at least they did during the Cold War. 

In fact we didn't just skirt around borders, [we violated Soviet airspace pretty regularly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident), confident in our superior aircraft's ability to evade detection and/or enemy interceptors...and it worked, most of the time. 

The Soviets never really fully penetrated (heh) US airspace, though, because they knew that not only would we know almost instantly, we could (and would) knock anything they had out of the sky if it actually entered our airspace. Hell we were itching for an excuse to play with our toys (or at least we presented that view to the world) and they knew it.

Also, and this is just me talking, I think part of the reason countries do this sort of thing is just to mess with them. There are other more pressing reasons that have been pointed out here, but on some level it's psychological, like siblings messing with each other in the back seat on a road trip: ""Getting closer...closer...Does this bother you? Hey you can't tell on me, I'm not toooooouching yoooooou."" ","1414800392"

The same thing happened in the Dignitas game where it looked liked iBP had it in the bag, but ended up throwing the game away. The maps I think iBP have an advantage on are Dust 2 (not by much) and Nuke. Nuke will be banned.

Yes, there was the practical aspect of there being enough steel to make two normally-sized swords, and so being able to give one each to Joffrey and Jaime without being seen to play favourites (not to mention that neither Joffrey nor Jaime would have had much use for a greatsword). But I believe he did it mainly as a symbolic gesture of House Lannister's triumph over the Starks. And there's further symbolism in the fact that the smoky grey ""Stark"" colour persisted in spite of all Mott's efforts to make the new swords Lannister red. I think this will be borne out in whatever part Oathbreaker has in rescuing Sansa (another unsuccessful attempt to turn something Stark to Lannister).","1414800394"

On Tuesday, I was offered Darren Sproles and Oddell Beckham Jr. for Doug Martin and Dwayne Bowe. Keep in mind that at the time, Martin's injury status wasn't known. The trade didn't go through until Thursday so the league and my commissioner had two full days to cancel/veto it. Even so, it wasn't vetoed or canceled. Fast forward to today at 6 pm, when I am getting ready for Halloween, and guess who shows up back on my roster? Doug fucking Martin, and a much less valuable Doug Martin than the one I traded at that. My commissioner put him back on my roster and gave back the players I had traded for.

So my question is, do you think **Darren Sproles and Oddell Beckham Jr. for Doug Martin and Dwayne Bowe** was an unfair trade on Tuesday? Also, is it not completely unfair to change someone's roster on a Friday night?","1414800399"

The seats are designed to automatically orient themselves upward after firing, in order to gain as much altitude as possible for proper chute opening, as well as allowing maximum clearance of debris or explosion. If an ejection occurs at an angle beyond that which allows for proper orientation, the pilot may not have enough time for their chute to open, or at worst, ejected into the terrain. More modern ejection seats (""3rd generation"") are much less prone to problems of ejecting at extreme angles at low altitudes, and can even re-orient themselves properly from a fully-inverted ejection.","1414800401"

Doms in this community get trained and apprenticed like no other community I've seen.  You don't GET to be trusted as a dom until you know the ropes (so to speak).  From the stories I've seen of this, Jian wasn't trained in this, has very little experience in this, doesn't know what he's doing, and gets sexually aroused by causing pain to others without being aware that their actions and words are combining to be refusing consent.   That's a  hallmark of a sociopathic sadist.   

And since he's been covered up by fellow reporters and probably the CBC for a very long time, there's probably going to be a long trail of accusations coming out.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","&gt;Your math is actually wrong, I think, since the chance can't be 29/30. It must be 26/30, right?

I don't see why.  It's assuming the cards are equally likely to be mulliganed as not, as I mentioned, but with that ignored, it means each of your 30 cards is equally likely to be picked.  The calculation is easiest done in reverse (ie. ""What is the likelihood we draw **no** deadly poisons/blade flurries"").  With that it's:

    - The first card is not Deadly Poison #1 = 1-(1/30) = 29/30
    - AND it is not deadly poison #2 = 1-(1/29) =28/29  ( 29 here since we've already eliminated Deadly poison #1)
    - AND it is not blade flurry #1 = 1-(1/28) =27/28 
    - AND it is not blade flurry #2 = 1-(1/27) =26/27

Multiply these all together, and you get 0.86667.  Then the same for the second card, so 0.86667 * 0.86667 = 0.75.

The likelihood that we will draw at least one of the cards is the same as the probability that we will NOT draw any of the cards, so is equivalent to 1 - this value, or 0.25.

&gt;the rogue has gone second, mulliganed all blade flurries and deadly poisons

Why do you assume this?  I'd expect rogues to want to **keep** deadly poison vs priest, certainly more often than the average card.  It's a low cost card that is good against early aggression (undertakers!), so I'd say the likelihood actually goes the other way there.  Blade flurry will probably be tossed, so with 2 in each category, I'd say mulliganning is likely a wash, and with 1 flurry, actually goes in the opposite direction from your assumption, where you'll be *less* likely to have them in the tail of the deck.

&gt;and (more realistically) it's turn 3

I don't think that's at all realistic.  Thoughtsteal is generally not a card you want to be playing on turn 3 even if you have it.  This is why the calculation gets more complicated - the effect of the mulligan bias becomes less and less the further you draw into the deck, so if you really want to factor it in, you need to account for the distribution of which turn it usually gets played.  Hence why I didn't bother even attempting to do it (particularly since, as mentioned, it's likely not a big effect given the opposite position on the toss/keep scale they occupy)

&gt;since 20 cards out of the 24 are not our cards

This is also a bad assumption, even if you **do** assume you'll always mulligan them away.  You can get them right back again, or get them as replacements for other cards you mulligan even if they weren't in your initial hand.

---

&gt;

&gt;The __1960 U-2 incident__ happened during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) on 1 May 1960, during the presidency of [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) and the leadership of [Soviet Premier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union) [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev) when a United States [U-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2) [spy plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_aircraft) was shot down in [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) [airspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace). The aircraft, flown by [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency) pilot [Francis Gary Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Gary_Powers) was performing [aerial reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance) when it was hit by an [S-75 Dvina (SA-2 Guideline)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA-2_Guideline) [surface-to-air missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile) and crashed in [Sverdlovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg).

&gt;Initially the United States government tried to cover up the plane's purpose and mission, but was forced to admit its military nature when the Soviet government came forward with the U-2's intact remains and captured pilot as well as photos of military bases in Russia taken by the aircraft. Coming roughly two weeks before the scheduled opening of an East–West summit in Paris, the incident was a great embarrassment to the United States  and prompted a marked deterioration in [its relations with the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union%E2%80%93United_States_relations#Cold_War_.281945.E2.80.9391.29). Powers was convicted of [espionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage) and sentenced to three years of [imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration) plus seven years of [hard labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_labor) but would be released two years later on 10 February 1962 during a [prisoner exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_exchange) for Soviet officer [Rudolf Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilyam_Genrikhovich_Fisher).

&gt; Out of curiousity, can you explain to me your understanding of the exact point at which someone goes from infected, asymptomatic and harmless to symptomatic and deadly? 

You still don't get it.   People don't go from infected &amp; asymptomatic &amp; harmless to symptomatic &amp; deadly.   

They go from...

* uninfected, to 
* infected &amp; asymptomatic &amp; non-contagious, to 
* infected &amp; symptomatic &amp; non-contagious, to 
* infected &amp; symptomatic &amp; contagious to 
* dead &amp; contagious or surviving &amp; non-contagious.  

The main contributor to the degree of contagiousness is the degree at which the symptoms present.  Blood from hemorrhaging, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever induced sweating are the main vectors for transmission.  

As an analogy, consider a container of poison.  As long as the poison is in the container it is safe to handle, but if the container starts leaking, it is then dangerous.  Ebola is not just the poison, but the thing that degrades the container and causes it to leak.  It takes time for the degradation to happen though.  The container being damaged but not yet leaking is akin to someone who is symptomatic but not yet infectious.  

&gt; And how does the virus in their system go from harmless and non infectious to infectious and deadly at that moment?

I never said the virus in someone's system was harmless or non-infectious, so stop putting words into my mouth.  ","1414800408"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Another rush job!  Can't take too much time for revision...sorry!

Look at the whole context of what I said.  To be a Muslim is to live a life in accordance with the Koran.  The ""moderate"", is an apostate, a Muslim who has lapsed (ie is no longer practicing the faith, is no longer a Muslim).  

I can see how someone could see this as being ""legalistic"" but it really is quite simple.  ""Muslim"" is not a family or a clan or a nationality where you can maintain the label even as you betray the group.  A Muslim is a Muslim even if they do not use the term ""Muslim"" or ""Islam"" simply by being in accord with the teachings of the Koran.  That is why Abraham is called the first Muslim in Koranic teaching.  

NTSF does not apply in this context.

Does that help?  It is the actions and beliefs that define one's ""Muslimness"".  That Oslo Mosque fella says what I am saying and his brethren in the audience and on the panel all nod agreement.  

So I argue, again, that when you apply the phrase ""moderate"" you create a false distinction.  Just call those that hold pluralistic views as apostates and keep it accurate.  But let them call themselves what they will.  Should their Imam come knocking then all that tolerance and acceptance of others might just go out the window. It depends on how ethical the individual is and can they reject their Muslim heritage knowing the trouble it will cause them.

Regarding ""true meaning of the Koran"", let us recognize that the 7th century peasant Merchant named Mohammad did not create a work of breathtaking complexity and nuance.  The Arabic translation that I rely on is by a Arabic scholar NJ Dawood and no one seemed to mind his translation of the Thousand And One Nights and his translation of the Koran from 1956 has withstood the test of time.  

So please read the Koran and dispel the mystery.  The messages are simple and are not brain twisters.  Lest you claim as folks like Tariq Ramadan that you can only understand the text in Arabic, I cry ""Bullshit"".  Ramadan is a dissembling Islamofascist with nare a true word escaping his lips. 

Now, the Koran does say that Arabic should be the proprietary language as this revelation, just as the Jews had Aramaic and Hebrew, and the Christians had Greek and Latin.  But why should we honor that hocus pocus?  Do we reject the Gutenberg Bible and do we insist on Latin for a ""true understanding""?  Ridiculous. 

Look, you can say that there is some funny wiggle-room in what a Muslim interprets on some minor issues but believe me, the major issues of relations with Non-Muslims are repeated over and over and over and they are truly despicable and consistent.  

And isn't the topic on the general compatibility of Islam and pluralistic society?

Read the Koran.  Get your head clear.  You will see how silly your claim of ambiguity is.


""Anyone who confesses to be a follower of a religion has to be considered as one.""  By what principle?  I agree that they should be allowed to mouth the words til the cows come home.  I will defend their right to say it.  But when we argue over these issues, we should have our eye toward the authentic, non-apostate Muslim and not toward the Iranian on vacation piss ass drunk at a titty-bar.  

I'll take you back again to what this entire conversation should be about.  It is about whether or not Islam is compatible with Western Pluralism.  Can Muslims accept the rights of people other than themselves to live and let live, to follow their own conscience, to honor freedom of speech and expression.  And how will they vote?  Iran had a election once and it ended all further fair elections.  

For me, the answer is an easy ""Hell NO!"" to the question of Islam being compatible.  It simply is not.  

Maybe Islam needs to have another 500 years of religious oppression under its belt or maybe even that would not solve the problem.  

Regarding polls, they do tell us the street view regarding sentiment.  And I hope you find the results as appalling as I do.

Recall that polls in the West will have a bias toward less extreme views do to distrust of privacy assurances.

But also recall that Muslims act, vote, and take up the struggle that their Imams dictate.  Their Imams are far more conservative than the rank and file.  I think that it is important to keep this in mind when we set policy choices regarding Islams migration into the West.

As always, Good people do good things, bad people do bad things but only religion can get good people to do bad things.  Islam offers us nothing but a hostile cult and we really should make sure those ""Muslims"" (apostates) that come here get assimilated and are atheist in their core beliefs.

"DishonoredRP","t5_32npg","**Character Name**:

Marisa Greer

**Age**: 

24

**Appearance**: 

About 5'6, long dark brown hair that is slightly curled (but not overly so), an unblemished complexion that is slightly pale (though not abnormal), a slender build with proportional bust, hazel eyes that are both expressive and sultry, and most striking of all - an easy natural grace and confidence to guide her movements

**Personality**: 

Coy, flirtatious, charming when she wants to be, but she is highly prejudiced (as all Gristol natives are), cold, and domineering for the most part. Which side will you bring out in her? By this I mean she is completely rational (or, as rational as you might expect a Brigmore Witch to be...)

**Backstory**: 

The daughter of Lord Harold Greer, a member of Parliament, Marisa had always been privileged, spoiled even, and led a seemingly charmed existence. All the girls had wanted to be her, and all the men had wanted to be *in* her... a fact that the temptress had exploited repeatedly. After all... men did most of their thinking with their loins, and we so *easy* to manipulate. Marisa cut a fine figure dressed in the latest fashions, and for a time had paid very close attention to what the Empress had always worn. The Greer estate in the Mutcherhaven District had been affected during the plague, as most stately homes had been, though they remained wealthy enough for Marisa to continue her decadent lifestyle. For a time the Lord Regent-to-be, Hiram Burrows had pursued her, though he soon grew tired of her games... after all, he was nothing more than an amusement to her. A distraction from the tedium of unrestricted luxury.

She and her brother had always stayed clear of the island on which Brigmore Manor had perched, not intentionally, but more instinctively. After all, it was unwise to go paying so close to structures that could tumble down at any moment, and were so steeped in bog it would be a simple matter to drown, almost without realising. One day, however, they had been taking their boat out among the estates, and Marisa's hat had flown off her head in a sudden gust of wind, to land floating in the water. Her brother Edmund had swam over to the beach through the foul water, and grabbed her garment... though a scream had rent the air, and he had fallen into the murky water face first, bleeding from the ears, his neck broken. Before his body stood a woman, garbed in ivy, with an alabaster face that was utterly pitiless, she had smirked and looked at Marisa intently. The noble's daughter had fled the scene, terrified out of her mind, but the woman had an easy authority about her, one which Marisa recognised in herself. She had returned the next day, powerless, besotted, and thus began her tale.

**Faction**:

I can't imagine that after almost 30 years in the spotlight Tyson doesn't know that something like this would get some attention, otherwise he would have said it on a bigger show.  He most likely said it to give them the attention as some reason he really likes the show.

You're drawing arbitrary lines in the sand for a show that we listened to because they held nothing sacred and white knighting for a guy who has spent the last few years being completely open and honest about the horrible shit he has done and went through.

There are some not-accepted alternatives to these, which do not require the bending of space and time. Most do include the Lorentz tranformations.  
Most are variations of 
[Emission theories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_theory), but according to wikipedia they are tested invalid.  

Some other are variations of ether, which are tested invalid in most cases. (Except for the case of localized ether).

Another variant is related to the quantum connection between sender and receiver, and states that this connection stays even after transmission of the ""photon"" (Moon/Spencer 1956). This one seems most promising alternative, because it is almost indistinguishable from normal relativity in most cases. But there has been not much research in that direction.

""You're not 6'; you're more like 5'12""!""

o_O

I started by explaining to her that it's the same thing, but then realized I wasn't interested in her anymore and I didn't put much effort into explaining that there are 12 inches in a foot!

5'10"" girl - not interested in me

6' (super hot) girl - loved me

Now I won't sugarcoat things. If you're 5', you're gonna get a whole lot more women saying that they're not interested in you specifically because of your height. But maybe two months ago I saw this impressive, buff dude (and I work out) that was probably 5', sleeves rolled up showing his arms confidently walking down the street with a hot chic on his arms. I always find that women are more interested in you when you're dating someone. Anyway, all you can do is make yourself the best ""you"" you can be and then it's a numbers game. There's someone for everyone, so never forget that.","1414800418"

Out of personal curiosity I started a project based on closed water-ecosystems. The jar on the left contains only the many lifeforms on the top of marshland water (Water fleas, freshwater shrimp, snails, etc) and none from the bottom/earth below the water.

The one on the right includes the lifeforms taken from the bottom/mud of the marshlands, which includes several species of nematode. 

That picture is ~6 months in (now) you can clearly see the water of the left jar has not been cycled enough by the inhabitants, leaving an overgrowth of algae that has damaged most of the plantmatter and is clinging to its remaining roots. No freshwater shrimp remain and overall signs of life have diminished into a small number of water fleas and one or two small snails.

The jar on the right is cycling its water consistently, there has been no loss of plantmatter or growth of algae. The freshwater shrimp have largely died, but have left a new generation that may end up better adapted.  

I saw a special years ago about a man that built a living sewage treatment 'ecosystem' that produced 100% clean water, the source of the curiosity. ","1414800423"

"sydney","t5_2qkob","I'm biased because I've seen what they do at restaurants in the U.S. and at home, and it's very different - it also tastes better.  In my 13 years of living in Sydney, I can confirm that very few know how to make a decent burger.  They often mix herbs and bread crumb filler with lean meat, squish it down paper-thin while it fries, and end up with something that either tastes like nothing or that tastes like a rissole.  You know that great taste you get from a juicy steak on the grill?  Imagine that on a bun.  That's what a burger is meant to taste like.  All you need is the right cut(s) of meat with good fat content so it stays moist while it fries (and adds a little more flavor), and a little pepper and salt.  No breadcrumbs or herbs.  You can't just use any cut of meat and expect it to work.  You need chuck or a combination of chuck and something else (should have white fat marbled through it when ground up - not all red).  Lean meat is flavorless.  Whenever I see signs advertising lean meat burgers, I know to expect flavorless paper-thin patties topped with a mountain of vegetation to hide them.  Give me a flavor-packed 1"" thick American burger patty any day!  When I'm in the mood for a burger, I want that grease to run down my chin!  I wanna feel it in my left arm!

It looks like the place Op mentioned knows what's up!  It says on their website they're using ""36 month grass fed Cape Grim **beef chuck and brisket""** - 2 very flavorful cuts.  I'll be heading over there soon.","1414800433"

Secondly, it's not a non-game just because it's got a lot of walking or whatever crap people are using as an excuse to spread hate about the it. It has a great plot, but the way the game works does mean that it's not for everyone; some will find it dull or too slow-paced or whatever. That's fine. Just don't call it a ""non-game"" or a ""walking simulator"".

Not everyone enjoys Bach's music, does that make him a ""non-musician""? Some find it too slow, does that just make it a ""low tempo-simulator"", because I've never heard anyone say *that* before and that's just using the same logic that people appy to games like *Gone Home*, and I hate it.

Anyway, if the lava goes the way I think it's gonna go, it'll be helping clean stuff up. The breakouts are looking scary though, and even the front of the flow has inflated a bunch since it hit the berms.

I regret having standards as low as mine were and I just really wish that my husband had been my first.  For the record, this isn't a sexism thing...I think if I were a man, it would have been best for me to wait too.

In terms of if she real as a ""human being"", my answer is no. She wasn't born, she isn't organic, she doesn't have her own flow* of thought....

So she is real: present in at least some kind of physical form and just in minds of some people.

She isn't real human: because she fails in all (or most if we're being lenient) aspects that define a human being.","1414800445"

They didn't really get into politics much until the 70's.

Skip to end if not interested in my story
&lt;On my first day of uni i was quite nervous because i didn't knew anyone, the prof mentioned how important it is to make friends, then in library i saw this girl in my section on her own. Why not, talked a bitten i asked for her number which she gave me, joked about how well this friends making thing is going already shortly after it became weird. a guy friend of hers was coming up talking to her i tried to talk to him as well, while she became a bit chilly, so i walked over to check out the books, she following me shortly after, talked to her again when she slipped in, in a cooler voice tone that it's actually pretty hard to make friends on uni. Then we ended up talking about the subject, she told me how last term 80% didn't pass why i was taking it this term already (which is bullshit if i don't and i don't pass in the next i'm kicked out) i was just standing there sort of baffled (what did just happen o.o) and she just said good luck, not to friendly turned around and walked away. I pretty much reacted like you thinking it over and over again, finally posting here.&gt;

Why do you care about looking feminine if you like how you look? I remember a guy from high school who was called gay by quite a few as he was hanging out with the pretty girls in a not manly way... well he ended up in happy relationships with many of them for which i still envy him.

Many people can't get tested because they already removed gluten from their diet. (If you aren't eating gluten, it won't show up in Celiac testing.)

"startrek","t5_2qixm","I don't think it's that far fetched that people in the future appear to be smarter. Just look at our recent history, specifically the age of computers.

My grandparents never were able to grasp even the most basic computer concepts, because they never learned to use them. My parents are able to use a computer but are far from as comfortable with them as me. They learned to use them when they were already adults. I however have been using computers since I was in my late teens, and it is no more different than riding a bike to me. My brother, who is 18 years younger than me, has used a computer since he figured out to hit the keyboard with his hands when he was sitting on my lap as a baby. Using a computer is like breathing or eating to him, while my great grand mother once warned me about the evil computers, out of fear of the unknown.

That is quite a huge step we have taken from my great grand mother to my little brother, who were born about 90 years apart. What will my great grand child be writing about me?","1414800454"

So you want BMW and Toyota to come back, then leave again?  BMW and Toyota almost SUNK Williams and Sauber.  They bring too much money to the sport and are the ones responsible for the huge budget creep that is DESTROYING THE SPORT.

We need racing teams like Ferrari, McLaren, and Williams.  Ones whos corporate interest is F1 and who won't come and go every other decade.

I've been on MUA since it was only like 2 months old with a different username and I'm sick of it being the same thing every year with Halloween, but only worse and worse year after year. There's finally a thread for all of the less makeup related stuff to go in, so people should actually use it. If you hadn't distorted my intentions maybe you would've gotten that.

The lack of difficulty and meaningful death in modern games isn't universally considered a good thing. I had a great time playing Shadow of Mordor for example, but it won't cement itself in my memory like some classic games have. There was no feeling of overcoming adversity or rising to a challenge, it was just an orc genocide/godlike power simulator. Too many games today see player failure as something to avoid entirely, which imo eliminates most of the satisfaction of beating a game.

Lots of classic games were bad, but a lot of them were and still are great games. I don't think the percent of great vs awful games is any different today then it was in the NES/SNES era, its just that the awful games today look nicer and aren't as hard, so people find less to gripe about.

Matchmaking doesn't work at all; it usually places more than 5 people in a lobby and crashes before loading the game. It works maybe 1 time out of 10, with each attempt taking ~2-5 minutes. This is after the patch that was supposed to fix matchmaking, mind you.


When you do get into a game, it's non-stop shuddering and insanely low frame rates for me. And you can't adjust graphics settings from inside the game, so if you want to try turning down the settings then you've got to quit to the main menu.


I know it's an alpha. I get that. But they should not have hyped this ""Big Alpha"" up so much if they weren't pretty sure it was going to be mostly working.

I really loved the lighting, tension and just the great sense of place the whole movie had, you really got that small town feel. Bonus points for being a scary movie about wide open spaces versus the typical claustrophobia you usually see.

What I love is that it's a remake of one of George A. Romero's more middling films which means A.) it doesn't have a reputation to live up to, so it could take more creative liberties and B.) they don't have to shoehorn in call backs to the original. It really was a chance for them to do right by the concept the second time around.

Not sure if *The Ring*, *We Are What We Are* or *Let Me In* count as remakes but all of those did their original foreign films justice.","1414800465"

Once you connect the HD the 64 gb is most likely somewhere between 60-58 gb. The actual size of the drive is always smaller. 

So for your case , lets say 60. 

- windows is 23 gb 
- all the other program takes about 10-15? That include steam , office , all the basic shit that you have to have. 

That is basically 50-60% of your ssd.

"LushCosmetics","t5_2tqbr","...I just typed out a ridiculously long and detailed response, and my cat stepped on my keyboard and hit refresh...lost everything. RAGE. 

Long story short. I have troubled skin. Eczema on cheeks and forehead, never-ending breakouts on chin and nose. 

Fresh Farmacy is my go-to cleanser. Light enough for everyday use, easy to use, and very foamy. Helps reduce redness, and will calm any breakouts. Won't completely get rid of them however, but WILL help prevent them, and help to maintain good skin. If you're having a crazy breakout, you'll want something a little stronger. 

Dark Angels is very course, but VERY exfoliating. Your face will be super soft afterwards. I would suggest using only a couple times a week if you have sensitive or dry skin (especially in the colder months). This will definitely combat stubborn pimples, as the main ingredient (coal) sucks up all excess dirt and oil. Because of this though, it can definitely leave your face feeling dry afterwards, so use sparingly. If your face feels tight after washing, use a really good moisturizer, and try diluting your mixture with more water next time. (Your face should never feel tight after a proper cleansing) Also, this scrub is SUPER messy. Black stuff will be everywhere, so use it in the shower when you can...this'll also help with better exfoliation as your pores are more open.

If you want the best of both worlds, try Coalface. My #2 favorite face wash. It is the same consistency as Fresh Farmacy, and the same (most) ingredients as Dark Angels. It is much less messy, and much less abrasive than Dark Angels. This is suitable for daily use IF you don't have a big problem with dry skin. As it still has coal in it, it can still be fairly drying. 

Also, don't rub the soap bars directly on your face. Chop off a sliver, stick it in your palm, run it under some warm water, and rub your hands together to create a lather. This adds longevity to your cleanser, as you don't want all that dirt from your face just sitting on the bar for your next use (hello pimples!). 

If you have any more questions, let me know!

Also, my seasonal favorite is Buche De Noel BY FAR. It just smells SO good.

"politics","t5_2cneq","My pleasure. A while back I did a presentation on how to be an informed citizen by not only keeping in touch with local, national, and international issues but countering rhetoric through diversification of media. To go into further depth, one will never find a news outlet that lacks bias, for both truth and ignorance tend to have a bias—it's up to the critical thinker to discern which is which. It's unreasonable to think there is always a middle-ground. So how do you discern the two? Separating personal beliefs from the facts and retaining conclusions to acceptable inference from known facts (people have a tendency to either 1: not know enough facts, or 2: know facts but make illogical conclusions as a result). The more resources you pool from, the more apparent the truth tends to be. The more facts you have at your disposal and corroborating evidence, the more sturdy your foundation of knowledge.


With that said, the best advice is to diversify your news sources by subject and format. For instance, I have over 20 RSS feeds from different news outlets online:

**Foreign**: BBC UK, Der Spiegel, UK Guardian, Al-Jazeera, Reuters, The Economist

**Domestic**: NYT, TIME, RollingStone, AP (Non-profit)

**Public**: PBS, NPR (Radio largely), CBC (foreign)

**Aggregators**: Reddit, Digg, Google News

**Tech**: Ars Technica

**Photoblogs**: LIFE, InFocus, The Big Picture (before it got inundated with ads)

**Independent**: RNN, DemocracyNow!, TruthOut, VICE

**Statistics/metrics publishing houses**: Gallup, PEW

**Fact-checkers**: Politifact, Factcheck.org, MediaMatters

edit: I forgot to mention that I watch **a lot** of documentaries. And whenever applicable I search scientific journals for further information.

edit2: I also read a fair amount (or listen to audiobooks). Largely history or non-fiction books related to current-events. But I can't resist SciFi, either.

All of these have their pros and cons, but that's the great thing about pooling from many sources. No research paper in academia has only one citation or study; neither should the facts you base your opinions on. Every now and then PEW will do a political news quiz survey, judging how well Americans are keeping up with current events. I can't say I catch everything, but I *always* am in the 97th percentile or higher. 

Edit3: accessible to acceptable

I'm used to being approached at work (which is annoying, but fine, since I generally have at least one other person I trust in the store and cameras everywhere) and even in a bookstore or gaming store, I'd be fine with it since the person could have at least assumed we have a common interest. 

Part of the reason the video everyone is talking about is getting so much attention is that the woman makes a point of wearing ""boring"" clothes. You can't assume anything - no band names, movies, gaming stuff, etc. If someone is in a relatively niche store, it's different than being on the street, because conversations about ""Oh, what are you reading? Who's your favorite author?"" can be used to develop an awesome relationship, whether it's platonic or romantic or whatever. Hell, there are sections for different genres in bookstores, and a lot of the bookstores I go to have cafes built in, so you could potentially have a conversation there.

But... At that point, you're not basing your approach purely on her looks or your penis feelings, as someone else so aptly put it. I think that would make the biggest difference in responses. ","1414800477"

Now you are right in that its hard to make profitable, and that is why humans probably aren't going to be completely screwed when robots come of age, because hey we run on food which is everywhere, are self repairing, self learning, self replicating, self cooling, can survive many environments, etc. But if you want someone to do your stocks, you ask a robot. If you want someone to diagnose you, you ask a robot (the jeopardy playing robot watson is now being reconfigured to do this). Etc.

Why train a human to go through decades of school when you can train one robot once, test them thoroughly, and copy paste them and have infinite workers with that skillset. ","1414800477"

"TrollYChromosome","t5_2tvh2","[Yes I do.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Rapes_per_1000_people_1973-2003.jpg) 

""Rape culture is a concept that examines a culture in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality.""

This definition is at odds with the data in the US.  A culture where rape is ""pervasive and normalized"" does not have drastic falling rape statistics year-over-year.  Besides isolated incidents, generally in a small town, involving prominent members of a community rape is viewed as a terrible crime in this country and is punished as such.

A conservative Islamic country that forces women to cover all skin with threat of rape and bodily harm is a long ways away from what we have here in the US.  For you to think otherwise shows that you are either ignorant of the truth or choose to willfully ignore the facts so as to make yourself feel superior by marginalizing the real victims.

There is no rape culture within the broader USA population.  There will always be bad seeds.  There will always be people who say that the victim was asking for it because she is dressed like a whore or that he must have wanted it because he's the man.  That gives no one the right to paint broad strokes across entire sections of the populous because they *feel* threatened.","1414800479"
"IT_CERT_STUDY","t5_2sme6","Having been in a TON of IT interviews let me give you an idea of what to expect:

Occasionally you will be in board interviews with 3+ people at the same time, not often. More often will be 1-3 people depending on the makeup of the company/how large it is. Smaller companies will tend to do 3 people while larger people will do 1-2.

Depending how shitty organized the company is depends how many other people are there interviewing with you, one company I interviewed with was not much different than [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOaPpbqRrcM) but that's a rarity.

Almost every interview they WILL grill you technologywise,the amount of people that say that they know this and that and don't know crap is astounding. They say they know networking but they don't know their ARP from their AARP. If you don't know something, be honest and say you don't know it and say how you'd figure it out/find the answer.The only thing worse than a stupid person is a dishonest person.

Tldr;  Yes you will be asked questions directly relating to the field, but only when you interview with IT. ","1414800479"

&gt;More than 20 percent of the nearly three million votes already tabulated in Georgia, North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa have come from people who did not vote in the last midterm election, according to an analysis of early-voting data by The Upshot.

&gt;These voters who did not participate in 2010 are far more diverse and Democratic than the voters from four years ago. On average across these states, 39 percent are registered Democrats and 30 percent are registered Republicans. By comparison, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in these states by an average of 1 percentage point in 2010.

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","&gt; They are designed to make you marvel and feel awe at old bearded monks, but one step closer to awakening the bring you not.

Sez you.

The Zen sayings I've encountered haven't been designed at all, much less to get people to marvel at the speaker or others.

Not only do they immediately transport many people to awakening, they themselves (the sayings) express awakening; they are made of it.

Just because words can't contain it doesn't mean words don't express it... and express it completely.

You know, there's a popular saying in Zen that 'you can't eat the menu'. This has been around for centuries. In the old days it used to go that 'a picture of a rice cake can't satisfy your hunger'. There's a lesson there.

But then Zen Master Dogen taught that, actually, your hunger *can* be satisfied with a picture of a rice cake, and that in reality whenever spiritual hunger is satisfied, it is with the picture of the rice cake.

This is a profound teaching that goes beyond the common way of thinking. But egoic attachment to understanding may resent teaching that goes beyond, may label it 'hermetic', and may think of all that one doesn't understand as inane or valueless.

other then that stay away from shot guns because they were nerfed to shit. a fast charging fusion rifle as a special weapon is always good if your aim is to bad for a sniper. you can get a lot of OHKs with a fusion rifle.

"tech","t5_2qh48","It'd be very difficult to make a fair and balanced test for this. Overall, OpenGL is traditionally the ""faster"" and more ""optimizable"" API, while DX is the more ""stable"" and ""streamlined"" one. With more recent versions, microsoft has has eliminated some of the larger^1 disadvantages^2 though (except for one^3 ), so if you directly translated basic rendering-tasks between them, You would prooooobably get fairly comparable results (on nvidia, on AMD the GL implementation is of poorer quality...)

But if you took advantage of the hardware-specific extensions OpenGL allows you to use, you can easily get into a situation where you can beat (at least naive) DX code by an order of magnitude. It's more work, of course.

On the other hand it'd also be easy to write benchmarks that when translated directly between DX/GL would result in poorer performance/more convoluted code on the GL side, likely skewing the numbers in favour of the DX implementation.

So as for benchmarking... Would you allow the GL implementation to use vendor-specific features, or would that be unfair? Do you go for ""natural"" or ""simple"" code, or for the fastest possible one? You get the same issues as with comparing programming languages, where some implementations of the benchmark might be optimized, some might use an entirely different algorithm, and some might just cheat by printing out the result.


^1 allowing for better userspace/kernelspace marshalling by letting IHVs provide their own frontends

^2 The old DX bytecode that badly mapped to a lot of hardware got replaced by a much more high-level one that basically exactly mirrors the source now

^3 OpenGL allows you to access GPU/vendor-specific functionality that can be a lot faster, DX does not allow you to do this.","1414800484"

"bassmusicproduction","t5_2zbyp","Well yes, kind of. You want the drums and the bass locked into a groove together. That's the most crucial element.

As mentioned, one hit effects can sound weird if they are swung. Also vocals will tend to go a little bizarre most of the time if they are swung. But for everything else (synths, bass, drums) it's pretty crucial to have them all locked into the swing beat.

Certainly it matters the degree to which you're trying to swing the track. I've gone for some pretty extreme swing lately (16-99 in Ableton), so any elements that aren't in the groove tend to stand out. But results may vary with more subtle applications.

One area where it's really important to have the swing locked in by the way is in drum rolls in any kind of deep house/garage/2-step music. You'll notice on transitions drum builds almost always have a strong onetwo-and-three-four, onetwo-and-three-four feels.

Edit:  Was just listening to [this track by Shadow Child](http://youtu.be/icUCCbaj_9Q).  Is a good example of the swing synced up on the drums, synths, bass, and sub bass.  Notice how clean the drop is at 1:47.  Wouldn't be nearly that clean if all the elements weren't swung in unison.","1414800488"

The ergonomics are good - it's a big, beefy folder. I was genuinely surprised with how much heft it had in my hands. The grip also works really really well in a reverse grip. I have one gripe with it - the liner is really thin compared to the blade stock - makes me think that batoning absolutely shouldn't happen with this knife. But I digress. 

The Eraser flips like a dream. The strong detent coupled with the heavy blade makes it deploy well, every time. I have to admit - the knife is too large for me to EDC daily comfortably, so it currently takes it's place as my primary fondle toy on my table. 

I'm sorry I can't answer your questions about the steel quality and the usage of the knife, but for $45, you get a beefy folder, a wonderful flipper out of the box. Totally worth it.","1414800488"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e"," In general, series are used to decompose complicated functions into parts which are simpler to handle: which series to use depends on the field.

Fourier series are used widely in acoustics, for example. You will probably have heard that sounds are described as sums of individual frequences. That is just a Fourier series(well, actually a Fourier transform) of the signal. It makes it easier to comprehend what a sound is ""made"" of, so to speak: we already know very well how sinusoidal tones behave and sound, so describing sounds as sums of sinusoidals is useful.

Another example are Taylor series, which are used in calculus because they can decompose complicated functions into monomials, which are really easy to derivate, integrate, and otherwise handle: Most entry-level proofs of Euler's Theorem/Identity use Taylor series.

Series *don't* have to be infinite for all relevant functions, but to apply them to certain functions considering infinite sums is very useful. Another user mentioned the square wave: as it's not curved, it's easy to see that it can't be a finite sum of sinusoidal waves. For the Taylor series, infinite sums are needed to describe functions that aren't polynomials.","1414800490"

Eikös tällä naisella ollut huoltajuusriita siitä ensimmäisestä lapsesta vai kuvittelinko? 

Mutta sinänsä ihan uskottava väite. Isät ei yleensä tapa, koska eivät selviäisi lasten hoidosta eron jälkeen, koska lapset eivät eron jälkeen yleensä jää isälle. Äidit tappavat koska lapset jää itselle, isät koska lapset jää äidille. ","1414800492"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;I don't believe feminism is a legitimate philosophy or movement.

so you are saying that you don't believe that women are unequal to men in society? or are you saying that fighting for that equality isn't ""legitimate""? it's such a weird statement. it's nonsensical like saying i don't believe that trying to get a job is a legitimate philosophy.

&gt;I believe that if the goal of feminism is something really aspired to, it shouldn't be championed under the banner of equality for a single group, but equality for all groups of people.

if women don't fight for their own equality, who will? this is like saying, black people aren't allowed to help black people unless they also spend equal time helping a person of each other race. what a ridiculous statement right? helping anyone should be seen as a good thing. syaing helping them and not helping me is bad, is basically a selfish point of view. your philosophy basically is a way to ensure no one effectively fights for women's equality. dilute it until it's ineffective for women.

on top of that feminism does fight against *all* gender stereotypes, including male stereotypes. also, there is nothing to say you can't be a feminist, and also be an MRA, or whatever you think the equivalent on the male side is. it's not at all a zero sum game. there is nothing wrong with having groups that focus in order to gain effectiveness in a specific area. it does not take anything away from you. it only gives to another.","1414800496"

"telescopes","t5_2qnl1","You're a little confused about what a Dob is, which is common these days.  You're using the word ""Dob"" to mean a Newtonian.  A newtonian is a reflector scope, with the mirror at the bottom and a secondary mirror near the top which turns the reflected light 90 degrees and out an eyepiece.

A Dobsonian, or Dob, is a type of mount for a newtonian scope, popularized by John Dobson, which is simple and inexpensive to build.  It's the basic az/el mount with a rotating flat base, a couple of upright boards and some type of wood or metal bearing on each side of the scope.

Small newtonians, 5"" or less, usually come on a basic tripod mount, either az/el or equatorial.  Bigger ones used to come on them also, but they're very expensive to make in large sizes and awkward to use, so almost all large reflectors these days are Dobs.  The old Meade Starfinders are probably the most common large reflectors on EQ mounts you're likely to run across.

The EQ platform is really intimidating when you first look at it.  The articles on building them are really technical and complex, which is why I made that thread to show that if you simplify them with just a pivot for one end and vertical curves for the other, and using a simple slow speed drive you can make one that while it doesn't work perfectly it works more than well enough to use, and for very little money.

I believe someone is making them and selling them on Ebay for less than $300, which would be the cheapest around, but if you have time and some tools it was a fun project and fairly cheap to try.  There's a guy on Cloudynights classifieds who sells the Celestron Logic drives for $30, that's where I got mine.

They really do help with observing, you can see more when you can just sit and look at a stationary object versus it moving all the time and having to interrupt your view to move the scope.","1414800497"

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Try spending/scheduling some time every day orchestrating the conditions of success. This isn't about sheer willpower. 

It's easy to make resolutions when feeling aversion but difficult to keep them when that aversion inevitably subsides and is replaced by indifference or craving. Likewise, craving is transient and cannot be relied upon. There is no substitute for right view and daily effort.

Willpower is fickle, it comes and goes. When you have it, use it to plan and train for when it ebbs. Increase your odds of success with the means available, including: education, intelligent strategies, and sustained practice to rewire and strengthen your mind.

Some suggestions (mileage may vary):

* **Meditate** on a regular basis to strengthen your mind. You're going to be running a mental marathon and training your mental muscles and gathering some insight into the nature of craving and aversion will help. I cannot overemphasize this one, as it will also help to deal with anxiety and other psychopathologies. If you're unfamiliar with this territory, Sam Harris has some nice guided meditation audio [here](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/mindfulness-meditation). Also, Matthieu Ricard has a good one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFQ6Z1LG0xQ).
* Start introspecting your urges as described [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-connection/200901/unleashing-the-power-emotional-connection) and in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Lg9P-VekA).
* Educate yourself on the implications of PMO. Good starts are the videos and articles [here](http://yourbrainonporn.com/) and [this](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/10/09/how-to-quit-porn/) series.
* Consider taking up healthy pastimes and projects to spend time and energy on.
* Cold showers may be a good way to defuse and build up some mental fortitude. See [here](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/).
* Delete any triggering material you have on your electronic devices.
* Install and configure [K9 Web Protection](http://www1.k9webprotection.com/) to block pornographic material (or [Net Nanny](http://www.netnanny.com/) if you don't mind investing a few dollars). For mobile devices, find an equivalent Parental Controls application. Use a [disposable email address](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) and create a complex password which is difficult to memorize, write copies of that password on paper, and store the copies offsite (e.g. work, someone else's place). That way you can reconfigure K9 if you have to, but not so easily that it facilitates relapse.
* Consider doing a full reboot as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4yx4ouxGbQ).
* Don't get shaken by flatlines. Redditors often report relapsing after testing their flatline with PMO; something entirely pointless, as PMO is a false positive anyways. Make the most of a flatline by using it as a precious opportunity to prepare for when it ends and you have to devote energy to resisting the temptation to PMO.
* Consider the many useful tips and tricks [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1tejif/the_big_list_of_tips_tricks/).
* If streaks are a big deal for you, consider tracking your progress in a spreadsheet. With a spreadsheet you can see how you are doing over time across relapses.

As most (if not all) Fapstronauts know, relapsing is often part of the process. Of course, we take as many reasonable measures as we can to avoid relapsing, but when we do relapse it's important to remind ourselves:

* The goal is mental well-being and non-exploitation, not a badge number or streak.
* Failure and course-correction are a part of skill acquisition. Abstaining from PMO is a skill that will take time and effort to acquire, but will also serve you well in many other ways. I think this is largely why people on this forum often report many other benefits coinciding with their efforts.
* Guilt over relapsing may actually be working contrary to your goals, as strong emotions coinciding with PMO may reinforce neural pathways. Work through it as objectively as you can. Meditation can help here also.

At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether your life is overall better when you aren't engaging in PMO, even if you are relapsing. Even with relapses, if you're getting good days and streaks, those are sufficient warrant in and of themselves.","1414800499"

I just hate that since its been taken out you seem to experience the ""commando knife lunge"" randomly, instead of because of the perk being on. Thats more infuriating for me personally, because they didn't sacrifice Ninja or Steady Aim to do so.","1414800500"

People in the West try to get a tan on a vacation, people in Asia walking around with umbrellas and bying skin-whitening products. Maybe this had an adverse effect on those Indian women and their reaction to your Swedish girlfriend.

I call on all citizens to remain calm, on political stakeholders and the civil society to show more responsibility in stopping the disturbances that can only slow our progress toward development.

"AirForce","t5_2roa2","I could be totally wrong about this, it's been a while since I was actually in CE; but, I believe CE handles a lot of emergency management stuff for a particular base, which is why fire and EOD is included. And I say ""handle"" very loosely; when I was in CE we were just trained what to do in cases of emergencies. SFS kept the base safe, so to speak.  

Something about real property within CE - maintaining all the facilities, including fire protection and EOD protection. If you were in when LFM merged with Utilities, there was a big question about why doesn't LFM merge with POL as those two career fields are always working together. Plumbing and LFM was somewhat similar, yet completely different. Our answer was that CE didn't want to A) give up the manning and B) maintaining base infrastructure (not talking about jets/planes of any kind) still falls under CE (and so LFM was retained).

Basically, there's anomalies of varying kinds around the world, and it's their job to contain, study, and keep them hidden from the general populace until they're ""ready"" (if ever). Everything from anomalous zones that magically grant anyone who enters a random piece of knowledge, to immortal, biblical figures, to time travelers, to portals to other worlds, to mythological creatures, to the fountain of youth, even pieces of *information* that make you go crazy or something when you hear, see, or know about it (how do you contain a piece of *information* without being exposed to it?)...etc. They're classified into three groups [(Safe, Euclid, Keter)](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/object-classes) in order of containment difficulty.

My personal favorites are [SCP-231 (Special Personnel Requirements)](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-231) and [SCP-095 (The Red Sea Object)](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-093). Here's [one of the three](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-series) main lists of anomalies written up so far.

There's upwards of 2,000 ""anomalies"" to browse through, and they're stringently kept to high standards by a fantastic moderation team and community.

It's one of the best RP sites I've ever come across. Here's an [""orientation""](http://www.scp-wiki.net/orientation) for new ""recruits"" (agents and researchers alike), here's one for [D-class personnel](http://www.scp-wiki.net/d-class-orientation), and another one for the [O-5 Overseer council](http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-o5-orientation). Keep in mind one hard and fast rule about the Foundation: **There is no canon.** It's like Wikipedia; nothing is true. Sometimes writers like to cross-reference a lot of SCP objects or incident reports, but by and large each reader can make up his or her own mind about what the Foundation is or how it works, the rival organizations, heck, even which anomalies exist within the universe or not.

I certainly did even though I disagreed with many things (and was outraged by some - as I mentioned). And I enjoyed it at times. He is absolutely correct on many things that happen during the Cold War. As for WW2 and before supplement his left-wing bias with right-wing bias. Historically the 1900-1960 conservatives were both non-interventionist (the politically fashionable if incorrect term nowadays is ""isolationist"") and anti-socialist. There should be plenty of sources if you start digging in. Perhaps ask on /r/askhistorians for sources or just search them yourself : Taft republicans. A lot of the Interventionist anti-communist republicans (of the Reagan sort) might be very much correct on the extent to which FDR's cabinet was infiltrated by Stalin and how the man himself was pure evil and such but they get it very very wrong after the war when USSR was essentially completely broken economically so I would recommend the hardliners only in so far as you should concern Stalinist era in the 30s and 40s. Afterwards it gets a bit complicated and while Stone is too soft hardliners are too harsh. 

If I can recommend a good documentary try the one with Robert McNamara. It's called the Fog of War and it deals with a lot of the excesses that the US committed during the Cold war. It's an amazing documentary - I thoroughly recommend it.

As for my personal preference there are many better books on non-socialist non-interventionism in America during WW1 which is where the US really **should** have stayed out. Whenever people say the same of WW2 I really want to smash their teeth in.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I've seen a few documentaries on Virgin's attempt at space flight. There's 1 craft which crash landed, but since its rocket fuel was burnt up, it didn't cause a fire. They fixed that issue up.

Another incident was due to one of the flap things (can't remember the name, it was to do with adjusting trajectory) got stuck, and if it remained that way, the craft would've spiraled back to Earth uncontrollably. They luckily got it going again (and re-designed it to prevent that happening again). 

And I can't recall if it was the same flight, but the navigation computer shut down, and the pilot had to look out the window. He said he couldn't tell if he was plummeting back to Earth, or entering space (he was going over 1000KM/hr at the time with Ge force of +3 or something). It was only when he started seeing black all around him that he knew he was going the right way. Shortly after, the navigation computer turned itself back on.

Any of these incidents could've lead to a catastrophe. All got fixed to prevent them happening again. Unfortunately the incident reported on today has resulted in a death, possibly 2.

It's an extremely dangerous activity testing flights, and their sacrifice goes towards us having a safe journey when it's safe enough for us to get on board. Today's event is extremely unfortunate but hopefully the advancements in knowledge that come from the tragedy get used in a beneficial way towards increasing the safety of future voyages.","1414800517"

"riskofrain","t5_2wi6h","**Sniper**: is an extremely hard class, especially solo. It takes a lot of practice so don't worry if you're doing really badly on him.

On sniper, the key point is to learn how to kite well. In general, on sniper you want to attack, jump, reload, and land. If you hit perfect reload at the fastest possible moment, there's almost no lag and you can kite while almost constantly moving backwards. Reload timing isn't random (though it does scale with aspd), so once you get used to it you should be able to hit perfect reloads consistently. 

Depending on how far away you are from the enemies, you'll want to charge up steady aim. Always remember to have your drone out for the guaranteed crit. If you're on flat land while kiting and need a bit more damage, you can backflip to gain a bit more charge time on steady aim. Alternatively, if you're kiting and you hit a wall, you can backflip through chasing enemies to start kiting the other way. 

**Loader:** is a melee class, meaning you have to play VERY carefully before you get a lot of items and start bulking up. Early on, most things are going to kill you in a few hits, and you don't want to tank them at all. Never go in on loader unless you have shield up, and remember that the majority of your early-game tankiness comes from cc'ing enemies so that they can't attack you. The easiest way to fight early on is simply to run away until your cds are up, then turn on shield, attack chain to get knockup, grappling to land the stun, attack while they're stunned for a bit, then run away before you can get hit. 

Once you get more items and start beefing up, you can start playing a lot more recklessly. If you manage to get lucky enough to get a wicked ring + a good amount of crit, loader gets literal godmode since you can reset the cooldown on shield faster than it runs out. 

**Engineer:** I don't play engi all that much, but it's not too hard of a class. They're ridiculously good at kiting, just kite as much as you can and plant turrets/mines behind you as you run. Homing shots have insane range, meaning as long as you're on a different platform/area, you can use it for safe guaranteed damage. Always plant mines on the run since they have no lag and do good damage. Turrets have ridiculous damage, so plant them against bosses or large groups of mobs

In general, engi takes a fair bit of patience since it's all about kiting/safe damage compared to stand still and dps like mad. Engi's definitely one of the safest classes though","1414800517"

Korra is a launcher of a thousand ships.  Part of the reason why you're seeing a lot of Korrasami is because a couple of her most popular ships in the earlier seasons,  Borra and Makorra, seem to be pretty soundly sunk canonically at the moment, so the only Korra/Team Avatar ship left that has any chance of becoming canon is Korrasami.  Therefore it's become fairly popular even with those who didn't ship it initially.

But hey, at least there isn't a Zutara/Kataang-level shipping war going on.  That shit was brutal.  Right now, it's more of a, ""Well, there really isn't much else to ship.""

"cars","t5_2qhl2","When I was 19 I wanted a muscle car. I found a 1970 Monte Carlo for sale in Columbus and I had just enough to buy it. This is something my parents tried to persuade me was a bad deal. I went and saw it and it was rough. But it was a muscle car and I would not be stopped. I worked out the deal and gave half of the money ($2000) and took the title to go get plates and the title transferred. While I'm not superstitious, maybe it was an omen that the day the title said I bought the car was Friday the 13th. 

When I went to pick up the car I was met by the previous owner who was on a motorcycle that pointed me to the back alley and said have fun then took off down the road. I started it and drove to the gas station. I had about an hour drive to get back and decided to fill the tank. After filling it up I started the car and heard a boom, black smoke started pouring out from under the hood, it turns out it had backfired through the leaky carb and caught the manifold on fire. After using a fire extinguisher and a gallon of Reiter iced tea to put it out we got back on the highway. Turns out in the commotion I missed the gas cap. I got a call from my chase vehicle that there was gas pouring out from under the license plate. The car was left at the side of the road and another gas cap had to be procured from the local autozone. 

Once back on the road the car started smoking, bad. I think the pcv valve failed but at the time I had no idea what was going on. I had to stop every two exits due to overheating and couldn't stop the smoke. I was eventually pulled over by the Ohio state trooper and informed that I was done driving for the day due to the half mile long, James Bond style smoke screen left behind the car. After AAA towed me home I pulled the motor and built a new one. I put it in the car and then promptly pulled the motor out to sell the car so I could go to school ($900). I still have the 454 I built. It's looking for a home. While I never drove the car again I learned more from it than any book on car repair. All in all no regrets even with the loss of money. 

By the way I'm much better with cars now. ","1414800530"

"occult","t5_2qhmc","Divination takes alot of forms, often times people do it internally without much understanding it. I have come to a number of personal forms of divination, however I noticed that applying it to money is extremely difficult. It could be that there is something of a powerful gate or something for like a club or something. Thats just my energetic readings in regards to money, however this isnt always about money. 

More often people hold keys that people are very much seeking for other obstacles as I stated earlier. My main issue with money is that its guarded like a personal fort knox to often and isnt usually given for the sake of balance. This isnt always money however.

I have done some bad expenditures but hardly anything I would think of as evil, and nothing to justify my current state in my opinion. I guess this is where wisdom and knowledge would come as being far more valuable then throwing money at a situation. I found your hierarchy of needs to be quiet welly put and must thank you for it.

Puting it in terms of chalkras does seem to make sense on a larger scale as well as personal, but I wonder now is what is currently causing financial disparity. My personal guess is the crown given that its issues are associated with spiritual poverty, and the like. If I where to go up to it and tell it to give, it may simply refuse like asking a millionaire for money. I suppose this is where nature takes place and things probably need to get very ugly then remain currupt. I find that if the crown chalkra is the issue, then thats rather disturbing given that materialism or mundane shit is running rampaged, and not being challenged much on a larger scale.

Well I currently dont have my job anymore and have nothing saved up since it went to student bills. Its obvious I cannot expect charity regardless of what I said here and it the consequences of imbalance.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","So here's my advice to you.

Study up on a couple of ""hip"" frameworks before you graduate.  If you want to focus on web, get some experience with Node, or backbone, or something along those lines.  

If you want to work with Java, grab spring and start messing with that.  

Honestly though, about 95% of jobs are going to start you in a VERY minor role.  You're going to be learning the codebase / fixing minor bugs for a few months and probably shadowing someone a few months before that.   To get a job in most places straight out of college you're good if you can show a job that you understand the following 3-4 things.

1. Object Encapsulation
2. Data Serialization
3. Object Polymorphism
4. Data extraction (xml &gt; json or xml &gt; mysql database) or something like that.  

If you can do those 4 things in the real world, you'll probably be able to find a job and pass about 90% of interviews in your choice of language.

Oh also.... don't put anything on your resume that you can't do.  When you say ""I know mysql"" I want you to know MySql, not like ""I wrote 1 insert statement 4 years ago in college"".  ","1414800535"

Siblings raised together can develop something called [littermate syndrome](http://blog.betternaturedogtraining.com/2013/07/18/littermate-syndrome/), where they really cease to function without the other. This is why sometimes you'll see shelters adopting out sibling pairs and requiring that they go together. It's definitely not a good thing though, they fixate on each other and have less interest in humans and other dogs. A dog should be with a human family first and foremost. If you ever get sibling puppies you have to put in a huge effort to make sure they're socialized separately, trained separately, and get a lot of time away from each other. One puppy takes up enough of your time, I can't imagine making time (or having patience) for two separate walks, training sessions, socialization outings and so forth.

But of course some dogs do really enjoy the company of other dogs and would benefit from a playmate later on. Some are also perfectly content without them... you'll just have to see how yours turns out.","1414800538"

I think it's www.oldoaks.us   The house was built in 1904 by a man named John Hina.  He was in the construction business and not only used the house to show his skills, but was said to run his business out of the carriage house that use to exist in the back yard before it was burnt down in the 80's in a rash of arsons.  The house is for the most part unmolested.  It still retains the vast majority of original woodwork and hardware.  The house was built with a servents bell system which still works.  Basically there is a panel in the kitchen where the servents would be.  If somebody rang any of the door bells or bells in the bedrooms or upstairs bathroom it would alert the servents as to where to go.  This system is still operational and believed to be original to the house.  All of the pocket doors and transoms work.  Feel free to ask any more questions.","1414800539"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I mean no experience teaching. The standard ""entry requirements"" for teaching English as a foreign language is a degree and a certificate to say you can do so (a one month course, most well known and internationally recognised are CELTA and CertTESOL). 

I have heard in certain countries you can go there as a native speaker and find work (Thailand in particular is good for this apparently) but I cannot vouch for that route, and personally I learnt so much from my CertTESOL course that I am not sure how people would do it without doing a course. Speaking a language is one thing, knowing how to teach it is very different.

I think a bachelors degree is worth pursuing purely for the sake of it, but then again I am from the UK where it is basically free because of the way the system works. If you are from the US then I understand the hesitation to dive into mountains of debt.

But you said you are young, there are plenty of websites and groups now that make it so easy to travel with little financial outlay.

Thats why, arguably, even in rural areas people would say that it is immoral to marry a child because they wouldn't have the emotional maturity to understand the future implications that marriage/a sexual relationship would entail. I think that's the crux of the issue. 

Dr. Brown's view (which he explains in another lecture) is one of moral relativism, in which we cannot know what is truly right or wrong because morality changes over time, and what was once moral is now immoral and vice-versa. Personally I don't think this applies with regards to child marriage because we have a much greater understanding of child development and emotional maturity so that we are able to see much more clearly on this issue than people in historical societies.

---

&gt;

&gt;__László Polgár__ (born 11 May 1946 in [Gyöngyös](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6ngy%C3%B6s)), is a [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary) [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) teacher and educational psychologist. He is the father of the famous ""Polgár sisters"": [Zsuzsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Polgar), [Zsófia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zs%C3%B3fia_Polg%C3%A1r), and [Judit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r), whom he raised to be chess prodigies, with two of them becoming the best and second best women chess players in the world.

&gt;He has written well-known chess books such as *Chess: 5334 Problems, Combinations, and Games* and *Reform Chess*, a survey of [chess variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_variants) that has been called “one of the most iconic chess books ever written.” He is also considered a pioneer theorist in child-rearing, who believes ""geniuses are made, not born"". Before he had any children, he wrote a book entitled *Bring Up Genius!*, and he later raised his daughters according to the precepts outlined therein. Polgár’s experiment with his daughters has been called “one of the most amazing experiments…in the history of human education.”  He has been “portrayed by his detractors as a Dr. Frankenstein” and viewed by his admirers as “a Houdini,” noted Peter Maas in the Washington Post in 1992.

Let's also establish that we are only talking about lobbying in this case because a 501(c)(5) is not allowed to participate directly or indirectly in political campaigns.

That can be good in the sense that people are finding other things on your site of interest. It can also be not so good because it means that either Google did a bad job of selecting your page for their search and it's not what they're looking for or it means that your page isn't enticing them to make a purchase or they weren't really looking to buy anyhow, just ""info searching"".

In any case, at least something about your site keeps them on for at least one more page view so that's good.

I figured if I ever wanted to stream on Twitch, I play with the idea but I'll never do it, I would piggy-back on popular nostalgia games being Speed Runned.

""Oh look, here's a FFVII speedrunner, time to jump on and label my stream 'FFVII blind walktrough' and talk to myself like people are watching.""

Games like that usually never get more than 1,000 viewers (all on that cast alone) and everyone else is usually piggy-backing like I said, fishing for viewers.

But it's great for exposure if nothing else, and maybe you'll earn a couple follows if you're good enough.

I find that we run around ""tracking"" this monster who can move much faster than we can, the only thing that can ""stop"" him is the mobile arena which requires a single person to be in range and be competent enough to know when to use it. I usually play healer and I am CONSTANTLY tranq darting the monster, instead of walking away he just spams jump and is gone in a matter of a few seconds, at which time the tranq dart has worn off anyhow. The monster can just as easily break out of the hunters traps (even when there are 4 of them on him). Then, by the time the monster actually wants to fight you, he is already level 3 and pretty powerful.

PS. The support (Hank?) can NOT use his mobile missile barrage (LB) inside. However, the monster can pick up a rock and fling it inside. How is that even remotely fair.... its laughable","1414800558"

It came from a smoke free, pet free home, is still under warranty, and we received all documents for the system. 

My insurance covers electric breast pumps, so we don't have to worry about that. 

Monitor - we found an identical version of the monitor we want labeled as a ""pet monitor""; it has all the same components, features, etc. but as it was labeled for a pet and not a baby, it was $100 cheaper. 

Clothes we've gotten from Once Upon A Child, Goodwill, and from some seriously amazing sales at Carter's. Also, we've received about 3 bags of clothes from friends whose daughters have outgrown them. 

We are waiting on everything else. If we get it off our registry, great! If not, we will probably go about buying it second hand or from Ikea.

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","I have a folder full of [these.](http://i.imgur.com/I8Ajydb.jpg) Whenever I get a batch of ink samples, I sit down and do one of these with each color. 

I pull the cartridge from my Lamy Vista, and saturate the feed with a blunt syringe (a la [this Goulet video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpnt18qqrPM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m4s)). Then I write out the sample info, the source of the sample, the nib in the Vista, and a few test sentences (bet you can guess what video was playing in the background when I was first going through some samples). I write each sentence at a different speed, as well as a few words that I write in specific ways, just to see how the ink keeps up, and to give me an idea of what kind of shading/feathering I'm likely to see depending on how I'm writing.

I also pull out an Edelstein bottle and use it as a straight-edge to draw a grid, which I use to test the waterproof properties of an ink (by spotting it with water and then either immediately wiping it off, letting it sit before I wipe it, or letting the droplet dry overnight). 

Then a smear test, and a few scribbles on the page to further check the flow. Lastly, I dip a Q-tip into the sample, and do a swab on each corner, and a 3 pass test to see how it layers, as well as some random scribbles just to show off the color. 

Then, I flush the feed with a [bulb syringe](http://www.gouletpens.com/Goulet_Bulb_Syringe_2oz_p/gpc-bulbsyringe.htm), and do the next sample.

Writing it all out, I'm realizing that I'm more than a little obsessive about it. Also, I now have like 100 pages in this folder, and it'd be nice to find a more secure and easily browse-able way to store them. I keep them organized by color (ROY G BIV, brown, grey, black, then fancy (Blue Ghost, Stormy Gray). Any ideas?","1414800558"

"svenskpolitik","t5_2twun","Detta var religionsundervisning som vår klass hade i första ring (undervisning som andra klasser hade i tredje) därför att vi var i hög-risk zonen för att bli rasister och intoleranta. Ja, detta förklarades också för oss. Läraren som undervisade oss var en ung muslimsk tjej (25-30 år), hon bar inte slöja vilket fick mig att tro att det var OK att argumentera mot det. Det var det inte, vilket var väldigt tydligt med tanke på hur betygen var satta. Visst, alla IG:n som delades ut (fler än någonsin i något ämne för vår klass) kan man lätt hänvisa till läroplanen dvs. att vi inte har lärt oss ""de grundläggande demokratiska värderingar som det svenska samhället vilar på"". Men i efterhand har jag inte den minsta tvekan om att det handlade om att lära oss ""att tycka rätt"". Jag tror helt ärligt inte någon från min gymnasieklass skulle säga motsatsen. 

Är faktiskt förvånad över att fler inte råkat ut för liknande grejer, jag tror inte det är jätteovanligt. Jag hade även en lärare under högstadiet som var öppen anarkafeminist och blev extremt förbannad på folk som kritiserade henne (till den grad att folk blev utsparkade ur klassrummet för att de inte höll med henne om högst subjektiva åsikter).


edit: jag vet att det låter som att jag misslyckats i skolan och är förbannad på mina lärare, men så är det icke. Jag var MVG student både i högstadiet och gymnasiet och hade faktiskt inga problem med mina lärare då jag är medveten om att de också är människor.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","I think the Mets will but I am of course biased. Loaded with pitching but will need some breaks to go our way offensively - better years in SS &amp; LF as well as a bounce-back from Wright and a more consistent year from Granderson. And of course being lucky with injuries.

I think the teams with the best chances are the Cubs and Red Sox. Red Sox will really depend on their off-season moves but it's hard to not think they will bounce back in some fashion. I don't know if they'll be real contenders for the division though, I see them as more of a wild card team.

Cubs are finally getting all the young talent they've been patient for these last few years. I think they will need Baez or Soler to have a break out year. There are definite question marks about the pitching and if they don't remedy it in the offseason I'll be less high on them.

Surely then if someone says they want to get rid of Scotland this isn't a form of prejudiced racism but a judgement on Scotland as a modern nation, and so completely different to saying ""let's get rid of pakis and niggers"" as those are based on skin colour and not on the character of people. If it's ok for Scotland to be able to say ""We'd be better off without you"" without it being prejudiced then it's also ok for England to say the same thing, you can't have it both ways.","1414800564"

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","&gt; Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve. (2:62)

&gt;The ayat (5:39) and hadith I used do not mention a religion or prophet one must believe in. It mentions only the need to believe in the One.

[Tafsir Ibn Kathir says Quran 2:62](http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=371) applies only to the Jews, Christians and Sabians who lived before Muhammad's time. It doesn't apply to modern Jews, Christans and Sabians and the revelation of [Quran 3:58](http://quran.com/3/85) has made it compulsory for people to believe in Prophet Muhammad and Islam if they want their good deeds to be accepted by Allah:

&gt;Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn Abbas, about, (Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day) that Allah revealed the following Ayah afterwards, (And whoever seeks religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers) (3:85).

&gt;This statement by Ibn Abbas indicates that Allah does not accept any deed or work from anyone, unless it conforms to the Law of Muhammad that is, after Allah sent Muhammad . Before that, every person who followed the guidance of his own Prophet was on the correct path, following the correct guidance and was saved.

This view is confirmed in [Quran 4:123-124](http://quran.com/4/123-124):

&gt;Paradise is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides Allah a protector or a helper.

&gt;And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.

And the fact that the People of the Scripture (i.e. Jews and Christians) will go to Hell forever (acc. to Islam) is mentioned numerous times:

&gt;Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures. ([Quran 98:6](http://quran.com/98/6), also check out it's [relevant exegesis](http://englishtafsir.com/quran/98/#sdfootnote8sym))

&gt;They have certainly disbelieved who say, "" Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary"" while the Messiah has said, ""O Children of Israel, worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord."" Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers. They have certainly disbelieved who say, "" Allah is the third of three."" And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment. ([Quran 5:72-73](http://quran.com/5/72-73))

&gt;O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers [*al-Kuffār*] and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination. ([Quran 66:9](http://quran.com/66/9))

.

&gt;The Quran says there is no better way than the Way of Abraham, pbuh, and he didn't practice a religion: Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? (4:125)

[The exegesis of Quran 16:123](http://englishtafsir.com/quran/16/#sdfootnote121sym) (another verse that mentions following the Way of Abraham) in *Tafhim-ul-Quran* says Muhammad was commanded by Allah to follow the Way of Abraham (as opposed to Jewish law) **in the early days of Islam**. Later, at the instance of Muhammad's last Hajj in 10 AH, [Quran 5:3](http://quran.com/5/3) was 'revealed' which stated that Allah had perfected Islam now and has chosen it to be the religion of the Muslims in the following words:

&gt;...This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion...

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","Developers miss things in games. Fromsoft is not perfect by any means, and neither is Dark Souls; there's plenty of things wrong with the game, likely due in part because it was rushed out the door on release. The Manus fight was released later on with the PC version and DLC, and may not have been subject to such a rushed timetable, but nonetheless I don't believe that *that* would have been an intentional method for killing him. And if it was, fine, I'd be incredibly surprised to hear it, but again, Manus is just an example for what I'm saying. 

I just think gimmick is perhaps the wrong word for what you're describing. Certainly I don't agree with the Moonlight Butterfly/Crest Shield thing being a gimmick; that is simply one possible method of beating the boss, no different than casting Great Magic Barrier and doing the same thing, or using the Ring of Fog to potentially lower the tracking of the projectiles, or by simply dodging and attacking when the butterfly lands, or by shooting arrows or magic projectiles at the butterfly while it's in flight. Surely these are not all gimmicks, and that is what I'm saying. With a bit of thought, anyone can devise a strategy for beating most bosses. Now the Dragon God from Demon's Souls? That's a real gimmick fight, because there's only one way to beat it that applies to no other enemy in the game. But almost no bosses in DS1 are pure gimmicks because they all feature multiple ways to fight them, regardless of whether one way may be easier or not. ","1414800566"

&gt; Pet Peeve: Ok. I will admit it. My current pet peeve is the no pivot backhand. And I was looking to see them fail and was not disappointed. I hate talking about the weather as an excuse, but it is important to factor in the conditions when warming up. The upwind downwind conditions with crossfield gusts is tough and you need your entire body behind most throws. If your default throw is to not pivot and you get too comfortable with it, you will turn it over, both high and low. And they did.

Edit: That being said, there's some interesting discussion of this in the [Ultiworld comments](http://ultiworld.com/2014/10/17/tiinas-take-nationals-day-1/#comment-1644972917).","1414800576"

There are certain moments that, as a writer and critic, sound to me like they are clearly literary fabrication/embellishment, like Adnan's monologuing on rocks as the sun starts to set - an image that, even setting aside SK pointing out its logistical impossibility within the given timeline, is so trite and obvious, an MFA hack somewhere is cursing the literary heavens that some stoner got to it first.

satire :

Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government or society itself, into improvement.[1] Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit as a weapon and as a tool to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

That was satire's purpose in Ancient Greece (half-Greek here). Basically the idiot is telling Shinta that even though what you are seeing is true (since he can't defend any of it), it's mean for laughs.

HBK not being around during the Attitude Era hurts, but in some ways that might have been for the best. Stone Cold was too hot to be denied by then, but HBK wasn't a good guy in those days, so his time away allowed him to come back a changed man -- and arguably a better wrestler (I would guess because he was pretty unselfish upon his return).

"photography","t5_2qh2a","You exposed yourself to MASSIVE risk here.

Through my work I have had to deal/work with some incredibly unstable and risky people. I know I have selection bias but they are out there, and they can ruin lives through making false allegations.

You do NOT want to be on the receiving end of an accusation of sexual assault or rape. They can destroy you professionally, financially and emotionally.

At the very least, I'd ensure there was a female 'observer' or assistant to  the shoot so that you have 3 people in the room not two. I'd also suggest that the model bring a friend along for the same reason. This is a professional shoot and the intimacy doesn't have to be 'real' to appear in the photographs. It's your job as a photographer to generate that in the image without needing it to actually exist between photographer and model.

I'd prefer to shoot at an established studio or impartial location such as a hotel - using your home address not only increases the risk (because her being alone in a house with 4 guys is a recipe for disaster in terms of the range of allegations she can make) but she also knows exactly where you live - not helpful in terms of cops showing up or heavies getting sent round to 'make the allegation go away on payment'.

Videoing the shoot would be a backup plan but only that. If you're in control of that evidence and an allegation is made, she only has to say 'this happened after he turned the camera off, he was nice as pie up until then' and you're back to square one. Sure, use it but don't rely on it as your sole means of defence. It's too easily circumvented.

Finally, I would be very careful in model selection for any kind of shoot where nudity or 'sexiness' was a feature. Reviews, word of mouth, previous work... I'd want to be very sure of the professionalism and stability of the models I was working with.

This is perhaps the cynic in me speaking, but this kind of shoot carries a relatively high risk, and therefore demands care to protect everyone involved and make it a successful, productive enterprise. I've seen too many people burned and come too close myself on too many occasions to place my sanity in the hands of an unknown individual.","1414800585"

"KCRoyals","t5_2s8ut","Oh, no. You misunderstood. I never said they were going to win or that I wanted them to. I said I was cool with them and then saw someone talking shit, so I decided that I'd like to see the Royals sweep them. And they did. Dyson's pinch running ranks among the best I've seen in recent years. He stole more bases in the Wild Card game alone than anyone ever has, on top of like 36 on the regular season. I'd say for the type of baseball the Royals play, that provides some good. I'm glad he didn't say he expected to go back to Baltimore, or that he thought the Orioles were confident they would. Whatever he does provide, I'd prefer that pandering or lying or doubt is not part of it. Not everyone is going to kiss your organization's ass in post-game press conferences, though it is nice to hear it when it happens. After Game 7, I never heard Bumgarner or Bochy say, ""But man those Royals sure were great competitors."" That kinda talk is nice for warm fuzzies, which I appreciate, but certainly don't expect.
    
So far as Guthrie, he's an okay pitcher who wore a silly shirt and then *apologized extensively* for it almost immediately thereafter, sooo... not sure how much more you want your hand held after a loss. 
   
I'm glad I got to watch our team have a [shit ton of fun](http://www.reddit.com/r/KCRoyals/comments/2j1d09/orioles_fan_here_i_have_to_share_this_story/) on and off the field during the post-season. After home games they went downtown to meet and talk to fans, bought an entire bar drinks for an hour, and even came out briefly after losing in Game 7 to take pictures and sign autographs and tell everyone how much they appreciated their support. Pretty awesome way for a small market team to interact with their city. I would say I'm sorry you didn't get the same enjoyment from all of it, but I'm not. Whine on, dude.","1414800595"

"videoproduction","t5_2s4fa","For 3.5k, I can give you some tips on what not to get: anything that needs a rig or external audio adaptation. Meaning black magic cameras or DSLRs.

I prefer to shoot with a large chip camcorder and I like slow-motion, especially for sports.

I would take a look at the FS100.
Personally, I do not like the amount of compression it uses but if you are coming from handy cams, you probably won't notice it.

It has proper audio, super 35mm sensor, and 60p slow motion.

It does not have internal ND filters but you could check out getting a variable ND. 

Kit: Sony FS100, extra batteries, tiffen variable ND, Sigma 24-105mm F/4 Sony version.

Feel free to ask any questions you might have.

Edit: Just to be clear, the Sony FS7 would be the best camera I can think for what you are doing. The price is reasonable, it shoots 4K internally, great internal codec, expandable, etc. But your budget is limited so that is why I recommended the FS100.

I also really like the Canon C100 and the mkII has 60p  now but for what it shoots, it's too expensive. It's not worth spending more than twice as much (c100 vs fs100) for just ergonomic improvements.","1414800595"

Anyways the boat was built in Germany and was brought down to Tahiti, thats where the trip started for my family and I. We sailed from Tahiti to the Galapagos Islands (Probably the most amazing place I've ever been to) then to French Polynesia and the Cook islands, then all the way to Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Tonga. From there we sailed to New Zealand and Australia, then up to PNG, Indonesia and the Philippines and then up to Asia, where we went to Thailand, Myanmar and up to India. The final leg of the journey was down from India to the Maldives and Mauritius, then the trip finished in the Seychelles. Now from what I know passports were not really an issue in most places except for a few places such as Myanmar. As I told you I was 7 - 10 years old so the whole idea was a dream of my parents, I was very fortunate to have been able to experience it. As for the company, we were 5 Children and my 2 parents, we had 2 teachers and 6 crew members with us for the whole journey. And no we did no live on fish the whole time, altho we did catch and eat a lot of fish we stocked up on food at the main ports where we were docked.

 [**Wastegate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastegate): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __wastegate__ is a [valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve) that diverts [exhaust gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_gas) away from the [turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine) wheel in a [turbocharged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger) engine system.

&gt;Diversion of exhaust gases regulates the [turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine) speed, which in turn regulates the rotating speed of the [compressor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_compressor). The primary function of the wastegate is to regulate the maximum [boost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger#Pressure_increase_.2F_boost) pressure in turbocharger systems, to protect the engine and the turbocharger. One advantage of installing a remote mount wastegate to a free-float (or non-WG) turbo includes allowance for a smaller A/R turbine housing, resulting in less lag time before the turbo begins to spool and create boost.

This is no way in hell how it should be if you ask me you litteraly just outright die if you get tagged by ANY and i repeat ANY 20 mm shell.

Its getting really frustrated when i'm playing a mustang i honestly can't even make a single mistake of being in front of a nose of 109 for a second cus he can just spray around my position and if any of those touch me i'm as good as dead.

And yea its 1-2 shells that kill me cus i've been shoot at from 109 that had no gunpods and i saw a white tracer coming to me and i died before it even came close to me

Now that's the He shell that came before that tracer and be it 1 or 2 i don't really mind but 1 shell into my plane does not equal = plane exploding into 4 pieces losing 2 wings tail section and an engine + a fire.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Off the top of my head, Italian teams rule this conversation: 

Juventus bought **Henry**, he lasted about 6 months and 16 games were he scored 3 times, practically gave him away to Arsenal where he became the all time leading scorer.

Inter let **Bonucci** leave after 1 game as he was deemed not good enough. After some time at Bari and Treviso, he signed with Juventus where he has played over 130 games as well as being the starting CB of the national team.

Ditto for **Pirlo** (let go by Inter), and then let go by Milan for being too old. 

Pepe Baresi recommended Inter buy his little brother, a guy by the name of **Franco Baresi**. Inter thought he wasn't good enough. He was then signed by Milan and went on to become arguably one of the 2 best defenders in the history of the Italian NT.

Milan bought **Edgar Davids** and after 19 games decided he wasn't good enough. Sold to Juventus, where he ended up playing 159 games over 7 years.

Staying with Milan, they bought some guy named **Patrick Vieira** and after 2 games decided he wasn't worth it. Sold him to Arsenal where he would go on to play 279 games over 9 years.

And now some lesser known youth cases: 

**Neymar** trained with Real Madrid when he was like 14. Can't remember why he couldn't stay in Madrid at the time.

**Balotelli** and **Icardi** both trained in the Barca reserves for a while. 

**Isco** was part of the Valencia squad although he primarily played in the B team. Malaga exercised his release clause of 6 mill and within 16 months the kid was carrying Malaga to the UCL quarters.","1414800603"

Awesome. You're a real rhetorician.

&gt; Yeah.... find where in my comments I said we should take a poll to decide rights.

It is the logical extension of your position that rights are whatever a culture has codified in law. All I've done is show you how ridiculous that view is by extending it.

&gt; Agonising over protecting minorities

No, that is definitely not what I said. Why do you keep making things up?

&gt; Rights are subject to change, based on the majority's opinion, which evolves, and progresses over time. Perhaps some slower than others.....

Loooool. ""Quote me saying that we should take a poll to decide rights!"" *immediately produces a quote saying rights are subject to changes in the majority's opinion*

You're lost in your own dogma, dude. You somehow are able to reference an example of majoritarianism endorsing and producing legalized slavery and still maintain hmm derp yup rights are subject to votes.

* **Best player** (*Average rating*) JW
* **Map played most** Inferno (*26% played*)
* **fnatic lineup** (*expected, according to hltv*)  JW, KRiMZ, pronax, flusha &amp; olofm

* **Information**: Well, where can i start? We all know that this is one of our prefered teams, which is also the top 5 team in the world, from looking at the stats at hltv.org. 
If the expected lineup is going to be the ones mentioned above, HellRaisers are in for some serious trouble. 
Let's start out by mentioning [JW](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=173&amp;playerid=3849&amp;gameid=2) [*1.17KD*] who is currently the top player on team fnatic, and who has also been a big part in the current success of the team.
From looking at the matches he played in with 'fnatic', i could not find many loses lately, (MANY CLOSE CALLS), but almost only wins.
fnatic are playing at their hottest right now, and have played against HellRaisers before and won (4 out of 5 times // [Image Link](http://i.imgur.com/M2v3XYC.jpg)).
&amp; Let's not forgot the 2nd highest rated player on fnatic, [flusha](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=173&amp;playerid=3055&amp;eventid=0&amp;gameid=2), who has a [*1.19KD*], and has also participated in most of the games where fnatic won over the
top teams mentioned above. Just check out their latest matches [Link](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=188&amp;teamid=4991&amp;eventid=0&amp;gameid=2). They've also beaten the top team on hltv 'NiP'.




//////////////////// **HellRaisers** ///////////////////////////////

* **HellRaisers lineup** (*expected, according to hltv*)   ANGE1, s1mple, kucher, markeloff &amp; Dosia

* **Information**: HellRaisers are fine, and do bring alot of surprices to their matches, such as close scores against their opponents (a few though.. [Matches](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=188&amp;teamid=5310&amp;eventid=0&amp;gameid=2)). 
The best player from HellRaisers, is [s1mple](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=173&amp;playerid=7998&amp;eventid=0&amp;gameid=2), who with his KD on [*1.23*], is well known for bringing troubles in with his AWP.
2nd is the Russian player [Dosia](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=173&amp;playerid=7998&amp;eventid=0&amp;gameid=2), [*1.14KD*], who is also worth of recieving his opponents fear.
HellRaisers are ranked 20 on hltv. [Link](http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=182&amp;gameid=2)



//////////////////// **CONCLUSION** ///////////////////////////////

Okay, as last time, i don't want people to hang me up on this, but.. the stats have talked, and i would prefer voting for fnatic.
They are more experienced, and have had less trouble beating up top teams than HellRaisers have. (..Such as Dignitas from Denmark, or Virtus.pro).
If i had to put on a number, i would say *66/34* on fnatic/HellRaisers.
Also, it is worth to mention that the map fnatic lost to HellRaisers on was on *de_dust2*.
&gt;BUT, heres a video showing fnatic beating HellRaisers on de_dust2, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1V0ZBL5_8Q).

&gt;AND, a 15/15 match on mirage. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb7jOIXdm6U)


&gt;* **Maps**: de_tba according to thread info. Hltv says, To Be Announced

*2nd time sharing my own thoughts on this, so please tell me if there's anything i could do to improve, then i might keep on doing it.

""hey Palecheese, i just shit myself. i'll be back after i shower.""

 you ever seen a ""first timer"" after a LONG horse ride? that's how i had ta walk, slowly, down 1 and up 2 flights of stairs to get to my apt/shower.

i stepped into the shower and started taking off my pants, no problem, always buy them a bit big. luckily i had worn my boxer briefs so the tight legs caught the mess in its entirety. i toss'd the undies cuz fuck that noise.

re-dressed and back downstairs i went.

Even if it's possible, it would take tons of time and money. I'd rather get some cheaper and easily accessible that fits 90%.

And there's this strange dogma that a fitting bra must go around your chest as tightly as a cage. No wonder many girls say they hate bras if their bras literally strangle them. Yes, they shouldn't be loose of course, but I get many criticizing comment when I say that I put on my bra by first clasping it on the front and then turning it around. According to them, that means my band is too big because with a right size band the bra would be so tight wouldn't even be able to turn my bra around. This is just crazy.","1414800607"

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Primeiro, essa é uma atitude hostil, o ideal nas relações internacionais, é sentar em uma mesa e negociar, buscando acordos. 

Segundo, com essa medida, eles estão querendo nosso mercado interno, e o governo não aumenta impostos para importações, mas desonera, dando incentivos para quem produz no pais, para que aqueles que investem no pais tenham maiores lucros.

Devido ao nosso porte, a ao tamanho do nosso mercado, podemos usar isso como incentivo, e são poucos os paises que podem fazê-lo. Portanto querer que a gente não use uma vantagem que temos para atrairmos mais industrias.. para que exportemos mais não vai tornar os produtos mais baratos e vai aniquilar com a produção industrial do país

No caso do algodão dos EUA, incentivos deles nos fizeram perder competitividade internacional, nos fazendo perder totalmente nossa cadeia produtiva de algodão. é muito diferente

No caso do EU, querem que (virtualmente, por consequencia) nós nos desfaçamos das industrias locais, importando mais bens de alto valor agregado, o que alias vai beneficiar muito mais a China do que a Europa.

A ultima frase foi nesse sentido, a idéia de que é o nosso mercado interno, e os incentivos de desoneração que damos a industria local, que estão sendo questionados.

 È muito diferente de um produto Brasileiro e um Europeu estarem competindo no mercado internacional por exemplo, e o Europeu sofrer desvantagem se por exemplo o governo Brasileiro, der subsídios, tirando a competitividade do Europeu.. 
ou qualquer pratica **anti-competitiva**

Se cobrarmos alguma taxa aduaneira a mais por exemplo, é até correto questionar, mas desoneração para a industria local, não vejo em que plataforma isso é possivel, pois todos fazem isso, a diferença é que em paises como o Brasil e os EUA isso funciona

Agora se estamos incidindo impostos a mais sobre importados (e acho que estamos), tirando essa politica de desoneração, nesse caso é justo que esse tipo de desincentivo seja derrubado, pois nesse caso sim, também prejudica o consumidor e a competitividade","1414800607"

Gonski - How was it unfunded? Savings were made via slower growth in university funding as well as in other areas. The states also agreed to help with funding. The entire thing had been planned out and was funded quite well and supported just as strongly across all educational sectors (catholic, independent, public, teachers, experts). Again your comment lacks any detail showing how little you actually know. Just spouting liberal propaganda like a parrot.

NDIS - Again completely funded via an increase in the medicare levy among other smaller savings measures.

Also to add to that list seeing as you asked. Rebooted R&amp;D in the private sector, apology to stolen generation, apology to victims of forced adoption, introduction of ets/carbon tax, stricter controls over 457 visas, paid parental leave scheme (everyone seems to forget this) and deft management of a financial crisis.

Everywhere else including Taiwan with few exceptions speaks their own dialect of mandarin, dependent on their region. The difference between standard mandarin dialect and Taiwanese is like the difference between an English and Scottish accent. I speak mandarin. Cantonese and Mandarin are two completely different languages, that happen to share a writing system, like Portuguese and Spanish. ","1414800610"

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","After reading a few more of your posts, it seems like you dislike those two characters not because of their despicable ways, but because they don't really *do* anything. 

It's less of a problem with Jaune, as his existence provides a platform for several other characters to bounce off of (Ruby, Weiss, Pyrrha... *Neptune*) and they are setting up for him to actually *do* shit soon. Judging by his little fight in this finale, they aren't going to pull a DBZ on him and make him OP overnight. 

On the other hand, Sun literally exists because Blake is racist and needed a faunus' shoulder to cry on. Their continued relationship makes no sense to me, and most of his appearances feel forced. If I recall correctly, you ride on the S.S.Bumblebee, so you have even more reason to dislike him. However, he is fucking awesome and I love him.

"inthenews","t5_2rgzp","&gt; You're incorrect. 

Well your analogy is very poor, rape numbers can be very accurately estimated even though the actual numbers of of reported rapes may be much lower. This is true for many issues that can be estimated by statistical methods. The simple fact is that fraud rates are extremely low which is the exact reason why no one pushing voter ID's uses anything but rhetoric and fear mongering instead of actual facts.

&gt;true numbers of voter fraud are unknown.

So like I said, no actual proof, just conjecture, and somehow unsubstantiated conjecture is a good reason for implementing laws that disenfranchise voters.

&gt;The President has even joked about this.

He also joked about being born in Nigeria. I would like to assume you aren't so gullible that you would believe that because he joked about it he was actually born there.

Bottom line, those wishing to manipulate voting need only foment the fear of fraud to force passage of laws that enact that very manipulation. Keep crying fraud and laws get passed that disenfranchise voters but do nothing to deter fraud.

Just extremely irreverent to everyone and everything at times, which is often mistaken for being misanthropic in general. It's a consistent pattern with people mistaking the nature of people who subscribe to a Redpill world view and are open about it instead of suppressing that (as they usually would in the real world).

That being said, thought policing really is the next step for SJWs in general. If you think a certain way, have certain fetishes, certain world views, you are suddenly a lesser human and deserve to be belittled and ostracized according to them. The way they use ad hominem attacks is pretty much to be expected. Character assassination seems to have always been a thing in internet activism since its earliest inceptions to the more modern uprising of it in 2008.  Its funny, because a lot of internet activists think it's BS when politicians commit to character assassination on traditional media (TV, Newspaper, etc), but when they do it, it's just nice and new-age digital activism.

Drafted Jordan, drafted Pippen, won three rings around that core.  Added Dennis and Kerr as role players, neither were anything close to superstar players.

I already said that the Celtics felt icky to me as well, but they were at least well past their primes, and Rondo was nowhere near what we know him as today.

The reason we cling to the relationships we form in high school is because we live in a bubble, a tiny group of people in a world that we don't have any ability to escape, so when we find someone that speaks to us in that place, it seems ENORMOUS, like they can never possibly come along again. 

But look at the math. In your world of a couple hundred people, you found one person to connect with. Great odds. Now you're in a world of thousands. After college, you'll be placed into a population of millions. 

Most people lose 
touch with high school friends and loves and lovers not because they weren't amazing people but because their worlds expand exponentially after they leave. So don't feel bad, and don't be afraid. Other connections _will_ come, guaranteed.","1414800624"

As for Gaara, he had Shukaku sealed into him while he was still inside of his mother's womb(we must assume that this was during or before his fetal stage in order for the theory to be valid). 

We can also assume that other villages made jinchuriki the same way as Bee where possible hosts are trained and then the most suitable has the Bijuu sealed within them as soon as the previous one is no longer capable.

ok

WTC 7 went into free-fall, literally gravitational acceleration, which is impossible in a steel framed building (without the use of explosives)

This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation.

The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance.

For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)

There's no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.

You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.

The tilting of the south tower, just before collapse is the second that i will bring to the table here (there are many more) 

According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn't, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn't and couldn't

Momentum is defined as mass times velocity and is conserved during both elastic and inelastic collisions:

P = M1 * V1 + M2 * V2 = (M1 + M2) * V3 {inelastic} P = M1 * V1 + M2 * V2 = M1 * V1′ + M2 * V2′ (elastic; V1V1′, V2V2′}

The theory of the alleged pile driver rests on inelastic collisions, whereby mass is accumulated with each collision and V2=0.

Thus, simplified physics disproves the official fairytale.

Let’s make the following assumptions:

(a) The upper block had a mass M1.

(b) Each individual floor had a mass M2.

(c) The alleged plane impact (or weak) point was 20 floors from the top. Thus, the starting “pile driver” M1=20*M2 (or M2=M1/20).

(d) Each individual floor was hanging in mid-air without any support below it. (e) Distance between each floor (to make the math easy) 9.8 meters. [Actual distance was probably 1/3 of that.]

(f) The over-design factor in the static weight that any given level N can support is 2*Mass(110-N) 

D is distance (between floors) g is gravity [9.8 m/(s2] V0 is initial velocity (V0=0) t is time

D = (1/2) * g * t^2 + V0 * t 9.8 m = (1/2) * [9.8 m/(s^2] * t^2 

Solve for t to find out how long it took M1 to free-fall the spacing of one floor into M2.

t=2^(1/2)=sqrt(2)=1.414 s 

Derivative of acceleration at a point in time is velocity:

V1 = a * t = 9.8 * 1.414 = 13.8 m/s 

Thus, before hitting M2, M1 reached a velocity V1=13.8 m/s. M2 is stationary, so its velocity is V2=0. Thus momentum P before impact is:

P = M1 * V1 + M2 * V2 = M1 * V1 (because V2=0) 

Conservation of momentum in this very ideal example of an inelastic collision (masses combine rather than bounce) says:

P = M1 * V1 = (M1 + M2) * V3 

Re-arrange terms and plug in for V1, you get:

V3 = V1 * [M1/(M1 + M2] = (13.8) * [M1/(M1 + M2]

Because M1 &amp; M2 are greater than zero, the new velocity V3 of the combined mass has to be less than the initial velocity V1 which was equivalent to free-fall.

In this ideal world with floors of mass M2 just hanging in the air, we can further assume that the starting “pile driver” M1=20*M2 (or M2=M1/20) under the premise that one of the alleged airplane impacts was 20 floors from the top.

V3 = V1 * [M1/(M1 + (M1/20)] = V1 * [1/1.05] = V1 * (0.95) 

In this ideal world example, we see quantitatively how the speed of the pile driver hitting a floor M2 hanging in mid-air slows down slightly from its previous free-fall velocity.

However, M2 was not just hanging in mid-air. Using the assumed over-design factor of 2, the vertical support offered by the steel shell and the inner core at level M2 

Force(M2) = [Over-Design Factor] * M1 = 2 * M1 

In order for floor M2 to fail, V1M1 has to also be greater than 2M1. In this example, it is. However, the momentum equation needs to be updated to account for the consumption of energy in smashing floor M2 and its supporting structures.

P = M1 * V1 = (M1 + M2) * V3 + [2 * M1] V3 = [M1 * V1) - (2 * M1]/[M1 + M2] = [V1 - 2] * [M1/(M1 + M2] V3 = [13.8) - 2] * [M1/(M1 + M2] = (11.8) * [M1/(M1 + M2] V3 = (11.8) * [M1/(M1 + (M1/20)] = (11.8) * [1/1.05] V3 = 11.23 m/s &lt; 13.8 m/s = V1 

Thus we see after impact with the first M2 floor taking into consideration the supports under M2, that velocity of the pile driver M1 should be measurably less than the velocity of free-fall at that point.

The ejection of content laterally reduces the mass of M1 to M1′. Also the Force of material ejection must be accounted for in the momentum equation P in a manner similar to the over-design factor. More importantly, the force of content pulverization is another massive energy sink that also gets inserted into the momentum equation P in a manner similar to the over-design facto

P = M1 * V1 = (M1 + M2) * V3 + Force(M2) + Force(ejection) + Force(pulverization) V3 = [M1*V1) - Force(M2) - Force(ejection) - Force(Pulverization]/[M1'+M2] 

If the assumed static-load over-design factor is low and a higher factor is employed, the resulting V3 will be reduced further. Similarly, using more accurate floor spacing will factor in by reducing the available M1*V1 energy at impact with floor M2.

The official report is in the realm of absurdity, cartoon based fantasy.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","Well, this is how I understand it.  Basically it used to be a harvest festival, although more technically it was the last in a series of three harvests.  The first was the grain harvest during the summer, the second was the fruit harvest during the first part of the autumn (i.e. harvesting apples and making cider), and Hallowe'en was the time when they ""harvested"", or slaughtered, their livestock for meat and salted it down for the winter.

So Hallowe'en became the time of year when the nights were growing longer, when there were animals screaming as they were being slaughtered, when big vats of blood were being boiled down for blood-puddings and blood-sausage.  Naturally it became associated with death, and so there were also ceremonies associated with death, keeping away bad spirits of the dead, and honouring dead ancestors. 

Death is scary though, and darker nights are scary, and having mass slaughters of animals going on probably wasn't too pleasant either.  So people also told scary stories around this time, and built up big bonfires to keep away the dark.  They offered alcohol, fruit and candy to the ancestral spirits to ensure their protection during this time.

They also offered food to strangers, because it was thought that strangers might be spirits taking on human form, and no one wanted to piss off a spirit.  But in the dark it's hard to tell if you know someone or not, especially if they're wearing a mask to disguise themselves from evil spirits who might want to personally harm them.  (Maybe one of their ancestors wasn't a very nice guy, for example.) Heck, that mysterious person over there might even BE a spirit, so better offer them some treats to keep them happy.

Some of them carved vegetables into little lanterns for more light, and they'd carve little faces in the lanterns to fool the evil spirits into thinking there were already good spirits around, protecting the people.  I say ""vegetables"" because pumpkins are a New World thing.  In Europe they'd use turnips and the like.  The veggies harkened back to the whole harvest festival deal, and later they'd offer their veggie lanterns to the ancestors in thanks (along with the candy, alcohol and whatever else they could spare).

Roll that all together, wait a few hundred years, and you get Hallowe'en. ","1414800631"

Unfortunately although it is reality that certain groups of people do more things than others Eg. Muslims have a bad name when it comes to terrorism, black people have a bad name when it comes to gang violence etc, because Of our past there is always room for blind accusation of racism. The reality is, that in certain countries, Eg. The UK has areas where most of the black people in the area belong to a gang and I'm sure the same goes for Latinos in the US in certain areas. 

Sure we're not saying that because they are of color they are criminals - but if they fit the general statistical demographic then what's the problem??

I can tell you  - she didn't quit her on-air job until she was making 3 times as much money on youtube as she was working television - and that took 3+ years of making up to 5 videos a day.  

The unspoken truth of youtube is that while it has had a democratizing effect on media, it still has not made the job of sustained success any easier for anyone.  It is HARD WORK, and you'll need to keep doing that hard work to maintain your income - including getting creative with your moneymaking.

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","I agree, this makes most sense to me.  
Jay's reactions and story's don't make sense to me.
Why would Jay say no ""f""ing way to Adnan when he says Adnan wanted Jay to help him bury her... and yet they were HIS shovels??  Why would he be ok with going to his house to get shovels? Wouldn't there be a ""no f-ing way"" reactions to... hey can we go get your shovels??
And yeah... he says he told me he was going to do it...
One podcast said that Jenn AND Jay came back to Kathy's house and they both said don't worry about it when asked what was going on.  which means Jenn was very much aware and now a part of it.
AND what about the call that came in when at Kathy's house?  Like Adnon said... who would that 3rd person be? and why would he ask them what he should say to the cop? That seems like a ""paid off"" statement to me.  
As far as the Nisha call... All i know is that she says that they called from the porn store that Jay worked at... So to me... she is confused.  maybe Jay asked her to lie (farfetched I'm sure)  but all the calls outgoing were jays friend up until then.  could jay have realized that and called one that only Adnan knew... and like Adnan said... the call went to her vm or answering machine... It was very vague on whether or not she actually had a answering machine... and who didn't have one at this time.  Adnan says i'm pretty sure she had one (but drops his voice)

Just overall.... Adnan and his story psychologically seems like he's being genuine... yes vague at times, but that usually comes with being genuine.
Jay just seems like he is coming up with very specifics and changing them when convenient and contradictory ... same with Jenn.  Characteristics of lies.  He doesn't seem comfortable with vague ... 

The other thing is that Adnon seems genuine in his digging into how he has come accross to others to be the type to plan this murder... if he was ""covering up"" most people to get to that depth... they are too worried about the details and being caught in lies.
My opinion thus far.. he is innocent or a complete genius psychopath.  I don't think in other ways he acts as a psychopath.  
I just think it's so crazy that they didn't look into Jay more.  His shovels, he asks Jenn to take him to clean them and to get rid of his clothes! 
Asia SAW Adnan at the library!! And her story didn't change!! (except when she got scared) but her story at the end was the same!! and it makes sense!

ONe last note.. .for there not to be follow up with Asia from his attorney or for the cops not to test the rope and brandy bottle, talk to Will ... and for them not to Follow up with Jay to ask for an alleby (which is just at Jen's house btw) and to see if there is motive there... I mean ask hard questions to the 2 people who's story has constantly changed! (jay and jenn)","1414800640"

She came from a nightmare, in which I was lost and taken in by a what a sweet old lady dressed in old colonial dress and the biggest smile I had ever seen. She feed me food and let me lay down on a small bed and all the while had the same smile on her face. I remember rolling over in my dream and saw her standing beside my bed with her looking down on me. The way she looked at me and that smile has always haunted me. At this point I will wake up in complete paralysis and hear my door slowly open. I can hear her footsteps coming over to my bed. I can feel her figure cast a shadow over my face. I can almost hear her breathing through her teeth. This is always been hell, but luckily only occurs a few times a month at the most. For anyone who has seen the French horror film Inside, that is a good reference to what she looked like and how she smiled. I still haven't finished that movie.","1414800640"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","""Your actions speak so loudly, I can not hear what you are saying.""- Ralph Waldo Emerson

This quote has helped me through many misunderstandings when certain actions don't particularly coincide with words spoken. You'll have no confusion on where certain people stand with you or others if you pay more attention to her actions rather than the feelings you get from being around her. It's so easy to forget how fleeting feelings are in the beginning stages of a romance (4 months is still fresh, don't debate me on this.), you met this woman while she was going through her breakup, do you really in your heart of hearts believe that she would still hold on to this ring if she were completely over him? I've encountered a woman scorned a time or two and they all threw away my shit. Take my word and take this as casually as possible. She will get rid of the ring when she sees fit, don't force it on her. 4 months is a little too short of a time frame to start placing demands on people when you're literally STILL getting to know each other. I think you know what to do more than anyone else and it's pretty logical that she is in no position to cater to the relationship needs of a 27 year-old man. You'll be 30 before you know it and probably still clueless on matters of the heart and young girls. Good luck though. ","1414800643"

I fucked up my study, but hopefully I can still save it by quitting gaming and using that time to get it straight.

Just dont fool yourself with the lame excuse that you'll play just for 30 minutes and then do something usefull, you know that you will just end up gaming your time away, at least that is how it works for me.

But its not as if he was man who held office.  He was god.  Its not aa if he could have those powera vacated.  Even in death, he remained fully divine.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Thanks for asking! I grew up as an American expat in Beijing, where there is a large LDS population, and had many close mormon friends. I used to tag along to church now and then, and other church activities for young adults. My first exposure to the BOM was in grade 5, coming over for family home evening and waking up for scripture reading after sleepovers. 

I was never going to be a convert, though. I was raised Episcopalian,  and although I'm an atheist, I'm still an active member of that church. 

But i have a strong and respectful curiosity about other faiths, principle among them, mormonism. I'm especially interested in the problem of institutional sexism, and 19th century pioneer history. And of course any modern manifestation of polygyny or polyandry is fascinating.

I became interested in church history when, as an anthropology major, I took a course around scientific epistemology which was focused on interrogating and debunking archeological myths like mayan pyramids in eurasia, ancient aliens, the biblical flood, the exodus from egypt, and mormon claims abt the new world. I did an independent study for that class and focused on some of the mormon issues.

My interest was reinvigorated when Kate Kelly entered the public dialogue, and followed her story and the spring general conference closely. That's where I first heard abt the CES letter, but I only read the first 3rd at that time. With the new essays this October I got really excited again.

I listen regularly to Mormon Stories and Viewpoint on Mormonism, and follow a few ex mormon and mormon feminist blogs. But I'm always looking for new things to read!

I think this is an exciting time in the mormon and exmo community and I'm reading and listening voraciously.

There are less spots, but these spots are guaranteed to make much more money. Look at WCS this year, how many NA players made it to ro32 or ro16?

Obviously if challenger stays at $600, than that's pretty lame. But if its 2k+ like ro32 premier was this year, than I think its overall better for NA.","1414800654"

FWIW, I rarely get less than 3 kills with fist of havoc. It is so easy to take an objective with it. You must play with and against some shitty players if they are using their super to kill one enemy player. In ANY class. Trading a super for a kill is as stupid as it gets.

I also roll defender sometimes, and use the shield primarily to create choke points or to give shield or weapon boosts to team mates... it CAN be used with good effect.

However, when playing a GOOD team, the bubble is next to useless. Against a good player who does not just spam their super on one player, it is useless. The counters to a stationary bubble are endless.


I can find innumerable examples of every other super clearing an objective or saving a team. I have seen a couple of these... SOMETIMES I see a bubble take an objective without getting everyone inside of it killed, but more often I see it get everyone involved killed.

"OaklandAthletics","t5_2scld","I realized that a premise addressing the luck comment is missing so here: 

Defensive pressure manufactures bad decisions by other teams, frequently seen as lucky plays, no where is this more on show than Giants postseason games, particularly this year, where they consistently apply pressure in an already high pressure situation (postseason) and get their opponents to screw up.

Offense first doesn't apply this same pressure, it hopes for mistakes but, largely, keeps the game out of the hands of the other team in much the same way a pitching blowout doesn't demoralize a team in the postseason (10-0 type games) because they know that it was one player and they it wasn't stressful. Whereas a 3-2 game is ever single thing I do could change the course of the game stressful.

1 run games are the Giant's bread and butter, they were born in the pressure other teams only adopt it, in the regular season they're hurt by lack of run support more than anything else and when that's not an issue you get beginning of 2014 Giants. The A's, right now, are a runs first team which means they don't get pressure plays they get big innings, shutout pitching, or lose games. In the regular season that works, probably in part due to regular season rotations which have more holes and defensive players which require downtime (see depth comments in previous post, it's not just an A's issue).","1414800660"

"knitting","t5_2qiu0","um, that actually looks like a crochet chain up the length of the scarf. Kind of like in this [t-shirt modification](http://steffi-cottoncandycastle.blogspot.com/2010/09/ribcagespine-t-shirt-reconstruction.html). You knit the scarf with two rows of evenly spaced horizontal slits (made like giant horizontal buttonholes, in *reverse stockinette stitch). Then you pinch the bottom horizontal garter piece and ""knit"" up with your hands like you are [picking up a dropped stitch](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/pick-up-a-dropped-stitch-from-several-rows-below.html), but instead of using yarn ladders, you're using the fabric.

Did that make any sense at all?

 No idea how they secured the braids at the end, maybe just with a tapestry needle and some extra yarn.

edit: it's reverse stockinette, not garter, I am off my game today

On top of that, the dating pool is much smaller.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Not sure why this is upvoted... Time is money. They cut the time for this game right? So they saved some money. They freed up their budget by canceling this game. Now I figure that not the entire studio will be paid the same amount, the marketing costs will drop, and a few other costs will be significantly lowered (even saying the Prey 2 team will be kept on board for a new project and paid the same as now). This means there will be resources left that can actually be spend on Fallout. They might be able to pay the workers for a month more or hire some extra designers or writers.

Funny part is that people think you somehow made a great counter argument, but this might actually free up extra resources for Fallout. As a publisher you do pay a lot of money to actually publish the game. That's why it's cancelled by the publisher, not the developer.

Now whether this actually frees up resources for Fallout, who knows? I don't think Fallout will need much extra resources anyway. ","1414800663"

"stopsmoking","t5_2rbuf","You will still get withdrawal on patches to a degree. Patches only work if you have the right mindset to quit. Patches won't do all of the work for you. Effort is needed on your part. First day isn't so bad. Day 2 and 3 can get tricky. After a while though things do get easier and better. Once you start don't stop. You could also experience vivid dreams at night on patches. If this bothers you, you can take the patch off after 16 hours for bed time. If you do decide to wear them 24 hours a day, make sure to replace the patch on a different skin site each day and at the same time each day. 

Even though Allen Carr frowns upon Nicotine Replacement therapy, it still is very good idea to watch the [Easy Way To Quit Smoking Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1aEC1Reb6M) It will help you get the mindset I was talking about earlier to help combat the cravings you will still get with the patch. 

There is a lot of support here that can help you. When you do need help, make sure to mention you are on the patch that way you may get help suited to your quit method.

Also as a motivation you can get your quit badge by clicking this
http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=badgebot&amp;subject=stopsmoking&amp;message=2014-10-30

&gt;

&gt;In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) and [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication), an __escape character__ is a [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing\)) which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence. An escape character is a particular case of [metacharacters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacharacter). Generally, the judgement of whether something is *an escape character* or not depends on context.

Understand, he was serving as the right-hand man for one of the greatest mind-readers ever, he could NOT foster ANY emotions that made him even remotely tolerable in harry's eyes, who, by the way, was ALSO subjected to mind-reading so if he was ever treated nicely by snape, red flags would be popping up left and right in Voldemorts mind, I'm thinking.

Snape is one of my favorite characters, but it certainly isn't because I thought he was a nice guy through and through. He was the greatest only when it really counted, on a ""save the wizarding world"" sort of level, compared to that, harry's feelings about Snapes professionalism as a teacher almost can be considered childish, even if that shit should have never flied in a school environment. Yeah he could have ignored Harry, but then where would half of the tension in the books be? Snape was such an essential and pivotal character, he carried so much burden and plot on his shoulders, it's ridiculous. Snape is the greatest.","1414800677"

The main difference between Gearbox and companies such as EA and Ubisoft, is that Gearbox traditionally ported games, they were able to brake out of such contractual work and Borderlands was their golden goose, but they never really took advantage of it, and instead of innovating on the formula they created, they've just repeated it. This is a smalltime company that hit the big leagues with a good dose of luck, and I don't believe they've earned their success. It's too easy to sell a product in this age, and they haves shown repeatedly that they are willing to rinse-repeat as long as they can appease fans and get their product sold.

Like I said, we fundamentally disagree on what makes a good game and what classifies as good writing, so we might as well stop here.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","The last two nodes in the Revenge of the Hunted cluster are good. For mixed nodes, the best way to evaluate them is to break down what each portion would be if it was a whole node. If both sides are worth a point, the node is good. 4% life ( valued at 80% of the node) and 8% evasion (20%) would be like taking nodes that are 5% life and 40% evasion. Both of those are worth taking, and the evasion node in particular would be fantastic.

The Celerity cluster is very efficient. A lot of players don't like putting any points into defense or movement speed, but movement speed directly translates to clear speed for most builds. 44% increased evasion can also be hugely important for Ondar's.

The Melding (life and ES) cluster is very good for hybrid characters and is still pretty good if using MOM. I wish it wasn't so much worse than the other Life and ES cluster, though.

The Scion's starting mana and AOE nodes are fine for specific builds (most AOE Scion builds). They're not the most point efficient nodes, but efficiency is less important when you can't get that extra AOE anywhere else.

It's obvious that you really hate trap nodes, but trap nodes are fine.

I could keep going, but a lot of what you blacked out really is pretty bad. The Templar area in particular needs an overhaul. That section with all the 8% increased elemental nodes traps a lot of new players.","1414800679"

"sewing","t5_2sczp","**Sewing Machines**

That's like asking a thousand people what kind of car they like best.  There are too many models to get a recommendation.

If you're totally convinced that you're going to want to get into sewing, google sewing machine stores near you and buy a good used machine that isn't overly fancy - depending on your budget, you may spend anywhere between $100.00 and $800.00.  My favorite middle-end machine is a Pfaff with IDT but that's strictly a personal choice.  Buying from a sewing machine store will give you someone to call if your machine starts doing something weird.

**Patterns** 

You can get basic mens shirt patterns from the the major pattern companies - google McCall patterns and you'll get info for McCalls, Butterick, Kwik-Sew, and Vogue.  Also google Simplicity Patterns.  And Burda sewing patterns.  

**Warning**

For the love of all that is holy, do NOT try to make a mens' collared shirt as your first project, or you will never sew again.  It's not that they're too hard, but they're JUST hard enough to make a beginner question themselves.

Honestly, start with a pair of pajamas.  

The patterns available for mens' shirts look very bland, but since what you're looking for is the right cut that you can dress up with snazzy fabric, that's fine.  

**Fabric** 

NYC is bursting with great fabric stores.  Start with Mood Fabrics, because they're popular and you won't have trouble finding them, but branch out from there.

**Lessons**

If your budget can afford it, google beginner sewing class.  There are tons of places in NYC that will teach you how to read a pattern envelope, how to sew a straight line, etc. for a decent price.  If you can't do that, start watching youtube videos, and look at craftsy.com.

Also, check the blogosphere.  There are several men with sewing blogs, but for dress shirts, I suggest Peter at Male Pattern Boldness http://malepatternboldness.blogspot.ca/.  Also happens to be a New Yorker.  You can contact him through his blog, but he's mildly blogfamous, and won't have time to hold your hand and wipe your bum, but he's a very nice man, and will try to help if you can keep the questions reasonable.","1414800682"

Inactive? Badr Organization is one of the more influential political entities in Iraq. Tell Grand ""Ayatollah"" to stop backing radical groups in Iraq so Iraq can be allowed to go on a proper path of recovery and reconciliation. I think the influence of these internal radical groups is seriously hurting Iraq. Unfortunately, they gained a lot of legitimacy during the Iraq War due to their opposition to the occupation.

&gt;What the fuck is wrong with you!?

Don't blame me. USA has wanted to do this since around 2006 or 2007. It is not what I want or my opinion. I am simply the messenger of aggressive US foreign politics. :3

&gt;Lol, Iraq's legal system is a secular one, 

I am very aware of this and thank God. However, there are very many Sharia courts in the country and many clerics who want to further Islamify the politics and society. This is what concerns me. I feel in a modern republic, religious law has no place in the legal system.


&gt;The same Iran which did leaps and bounds better than Iraq when Iraq was being ruled by a secular dictator . . .


Iran had an independent empire for centuries. Iraq became independent in 1932 after centuries of exploitation, only to have a monarchy who sold them out and the US interfering and destabilizing the country since 1958. And yet in the 60s-80s, people from then say Iraq was in better shape than Iran and most of the Middle East. :S Iran obviously had centuries of very terrible leadership for it not to be a wealthy and developed country today. Nowadays, of course Iraq is destroyed, but in the Mideast, all the countries are in better shape than Iran except Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and maybe Jordan. Israel is not the wealthiest, but certainly the most modernized.

&gt;yeah . . . As an Iranian actually living in Iran (Mashhad, Khorasan Provence), this is pretty bullshit . . .

I know some Iranians living in Iran (who I knew because I met them on travels or vacations), and dozens who recently left to US. They tell me they and the people hate the Islamist Khomeini authoritarian no-respect-for-peoples-personal-rights type of Islamist state that exists in Iran. They are good people. I have many good things to say about Persian folk. Welcome to /r/Iraq and enjoy your stay. We don't have much anymore but we still have rivers and tea and curry.

&gt;I'm sorry, what country was the one which invaded Iraq twice and squashed it with sanctions (while killing hundreds of innocent Iraqis who couldn't get access to food and medical equipment thanks to said sanctions).

Hundreds? Try over a million. The US's goal with the embargo was to destroy Iraq, and it was a full trade embargo. The sanctions on Iran and N. Korea and Russia are a slap on the wrist in comparison of the severity. You cannot even fathom the terrible horrors of what a full-trade embargo will do, where a country is not allowed to have any trade or association with anyone else. A full-embargo would even put any developed country like in Europe deep in the 3rd world. The Iraqi government developed an astonishingly effective rationing system and still so many died. Imagine if they hadn't, maybe 5 million people would be dead, not between 1 and 2 million. The embargo was genocide of the people and genocide of the economy.


&gt;The US turned Iraq into a shithole and then completely fucked up the responsibility of placing a progressive and un-corrupt government. The American military was crawling all over Iraq, don't tell me they didn't make the changes they wanted to with the government.

The US did very well to turn Iraq into a shithole. Although, the embargo turned it into a shithole even before the 2003 war, then that war made it even more of a shithole, while removing everyone keeping it from becoming worse lol. It placed a government infinitely more corrupt than the Baath. The Baath regime was pretty good about keeping low corruption and knew how to run a country well. Now, New Iraq was top 5 in the world in corruption and until Maliki was removed from office, was terrible at running the country XD 


The US also created a sectarian identification system in Iraq and promoted the creation of sectarian organizations and groups. Maybe you don't know, but before 2003, it was uncommon to hear of Sunni-Shia problems, because the sectarianism that exists today didn't exist back then in the society. Usually people would just talk about Arab-Kurdi problems. 

It was a significantly more cohesive society than it is nowadays and the Iraqi national identity was much stronger. 

&gt;Also my country is far from sectarian, Iran's four corners are predominantly Sunni, yet you only hear conflict with the bottom two. The northern part of Iran is sunni and they live peacefully with us shias, there is no discrimination here. The only reason there is any problem in Awhaz and Sistan Baloochistan is because foreign secessionist movements (made up of people like you) play on the ethnic differences of people in order for personal gain.

Your country is also 90% Shiite and almost all of the non-Muslims left when Lord and Savior Khomeini seized power. I am responsible for problems in Awhaz and Sistan Baloochistan? I play on ethnic differences? This is a very strong assertion! I am supportive of the Arabs and Kurds and Assyrians and Turkomen and Yazidis and other ethnicities within Iraq.

Dude, do you realize that in the last 10 years, over 1 million people of my small ethnicity have fled Iraq or were killed by Islamic radicals and sectarianists for being Christian? Even some relatives had vanished or were murdered. And you tell me that I play on sectarianism? I am a great anti-sectarianist. Why do you think I am angered with ISIS and Maliki and other terrible people who do everything to divide Iraq?

&gt;When was the last time the Iraqi government ever cracked down on that type of stuff?

One of the reasons I think that EL84 amps sound so good is that they are super easy to drive, so the phase splitter, even if very simple, performs quite well.

An old ST-70 with an original power supply cap may have a soft power supply that will be more noticeable than a soft power supply on the ST-35.  

I am also a fan of the SCA-35 (with the tone controls removed), it's a great single box solution to a great sounding stereo.  If you combine a SCA-35 with a pair of original quads, it's hard to beat.  I got that combo in college for $350.  

That being said, my ticket to audio nirvana is a rebuilt HK Citation II and a pair of Quad 63's being driven by a custom DAC through a passive preamp.  ","1414800685"

"EnoughLibertarianSpam","t5_2tzlb","How come you remembered my post 2 months later?

Also
&gt;In addition, I think that the moralism of OP's argument is essentially condescending. It is telling the poor that OP knows better how to manage their lives than they do.

I really failled to get the point through in that post. It's not about the right of the poor to sell their organs (well it's about that, too, but I didn't focus on it much), it's about contextual oppression, structural violence. The way that kind of choice is not substantively voluntary but coerced by an *artificial* state of necessity. 

The cell analogy wasn't as lucid as I hoped. It's like someone pushing a knife into your lung and then offering to patch you up (he is an excellent doctor) in exchange for a sum of money. If we hide the stabbing behind a veil, the exchange itself seems voluntary and it seems like a pareto improvement. Everyone is better off than before, otherwise they wouldn't make the exchange. But if you look back to the stabbing it's clear it's not actually an improvement, if you weren't stabbed you wouldn't make that exchange at all, after the exchange you are worse off than you were before the stabbing (you are intact but have less money) and you only agreed to the terms because the alternative (bleeding out) was not meaningful. Now let's say that someone else stabbed you and the doctor really did just want to help. All the same still applies, except now you can't blame the doctor for the stabbing (but can't you blame him for watching you bleed out unless you pay him? Even ancient people found this unacceptable). Well in real life we have all made a robot (a faceless construct, an artificial series of institutions) that does the stabbing before the doctor offers to help for a fee. You accept the conditions (losing a piece), not the money (there are other ways for desperate people to get money, society can choose other venues than that transaction) because you have no meaningful alternative (do or starve). You have no meaningful alternative (you are in the do or starve dilemma) because of your circumstances (poverty) which are an outcome of the way we organise society and distributory institutions. Therefore those that decided on the institutions more or less forced you to lose an organ.

 It's, you are free to wander around, but there are people with guns that will stop you if you try to eat any food. In order to eat you need some tokens, but you can only receive the tokens under certain conditions, and for whatever reason you don't fulfill that criteria (even due to dumb luck). So you are given the choice to either die or sell yourself. How is this a voluntary choice? How is this not violence? The food is right there! How is this any different from a monarch that would directly tell you that he doesn't like you and you won't eat unless you sell your kidney? The only difference is that here the sovereign doesn't tell you they don't like you, they simply write a decree that the abstract people that happen to have your characteristics won't be eating food unless they sell their kidneys. It's impersonally personal.

They are framing selling your organs as a liberating alternative. After all since you got stabbed, and until we stop stabbings, it's best for a doctor to patch you up. But this is a misdirection. No one objects to the doctor patching you up. I'm objecting to the imposed conditions for the doctor to patch you up. Yes, eliminating the structures that cause poverty is a good thing, but in the mean time we have a choice (and I'm not touching here issues of inalienability that I think have significant merit, all the people crying about paternalism be damned, or the issues with the waiting list that I also think can not justly conform to income distribution, I see no reason why the organs, objectified life, should go to the highest bidder. Why does the highest bidder deserve to live more than someone else?). We can argue that the desperate poor should be allowed to receive money (get patched up) in exchange for their organs (that is, continue to positively exclude them from the means of life unless they agree to the conditions. This is literally watching the other guy die unless he complies to sell a part of him, how much more clear can this be?), or we can argue that they should receive money and keep their organs. Do you see that the transaction masquerades as an alternative but is in fact a positively enforced obligation? They are not giving you an alternative to your condition, they are taking advantage of the condition they created and keep enforcing to make you do something you don't want to do because it benefits them. They build the cell, then they offer you a way out for a pound of flesh and you should be grateful?

This is reflected by equipment problems (still using a practically  identical load-carrying equipment as 40 years ago, having only enough bullet-proof vests for our soldiers abroad) typical for the failed transition from a defensive army to a strike force.

If the Bundeswehr was to defend Poland against an invading force, the biggest problem would be our supply lines. We drastically reduced our supply forces to an absolute barebone excuse and probably wouldn't be able to sustain our forces in Poland. Our army would most likely collapse before our reinforcements reached the Polish battlefields. 
Perhaps the Air Force would be more successful, but our tank battalions and APCs would have severe trouble in being of help.","1414800689"

You've been on attack mode since your very first post, before I even got here.  As an added bonus, you seem to think the terms ""racism"" and ""evidence"" require scare quotes.  How perfectly Republican of you.

At some point I will graduate and I don't think it's fair that I wait 4 years to just start dating someone. If you click with someone I don't understand why you can't compromise - for example, come over and bring dinner sometime because you both have to eat and you can use that time to catch up.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","The only point I might contest is using some ""meta"" unit as a way to determine value, because Bitcoin will be this eventually.

Lets cast aside current fiat/crypto exchange rates and pretend that no longer matters (ie the fiat economy imploded and crypto is all that is left).

Bitcoin will be the universal base currency to which all others are pegged. In effect, a crypto-reserve currency exchangeable into any other cryptocoin. Bitcoin does not exist to back any particular organization, movement, meme, whatever, but just simply is. Other coins will be very defined in their purpose as Andreas says, but always pinned to Bitcoin as a way to define a currencies value.

It is already like this on many exchanges. Typically for the alts, there is only alt/BTC pairing, not alt/alt or even alt/fiat pairing with the exception of Litecoin and a couple others. Altcoin value is already pegged to how much Bitcoin it is worth. 

Overall this is a good presentation that explains well why the altcoins, as dumb or scammy as many of them are, are not only never going away, but will only grow and become methods for communities to be represented through their own sovereign currency. ","1414800693"

"Hair","t5_2qmsf","Damage is caused by heat styling, permanent dye/ bleach, sunlight and mechanical damage (detangling, brushing when wet, rubbing on fabrics, etc), hygral fatigue and harsh shampoo.

You stop it by treating your hair better! Long hair care forums often advise you treat hair like antique lace. Remember hair is dead, damage is cumulative and cannot be reversed or 'heal' as skin can.

Asian hair is often coarse, so likely won't ever feel as soft as finer hair. Coarse hair does not lack protein up to the point it is so fried nothing can save it, it is more likely to lack elasticity and emollience (softness, slip, shine). Don't confuse lack of emollience or damage with lack of water ,they are not one and the same and we cannot measure the water content in our hair.

If you have high porosity treat that with penetrating oils such as coconut, this should also improve elasticity/ reduce brittleness with regular use. Also do regular deep conditioning sessions, something like **Redken Extreme Strength Builder PLUS** has a modest amount of protein but also ceramides, 18-MEA, the major emollients and a little silicone. So loaded with scientifically proven ingredients.

Conditioner only washing is arguably the gentlest cleansing method, but do stretch washes with dry shampoo to reduce hygral fatigie (water damage). Only detangle with your fingers or a very wide tooth comb, brush your hair as infrequently as possible.","1414800694"

Naked Lunch has significance in the literary world. Cities of the Red Night does quite well, too. Queer is a pretty important example of blatantly gay lit at a time when it was more than taboo, even if it wasn't published until the 1980's. I'd say the near constant, steady growth of popularity and scholarship on his work over the past 15 years is pretty strong evidence, too. At least among scholars and the people most concerned with the literary world.

And in what way does Ginsberg and Kerouac helping him get famous detract from his ability? The same can be said for a whole lot of people. Regardless, associating Burroughs so closely with the Beats basically underlines the fact that you are not in the know on this one. Even he himself didn't think of himself that way.

"sailing","t5_2qiye","it depends what you're looking for. i have a 1986, and it's incredibly comfortable. mine is the rare fixed keel version, but the boat design is very similar either way. The older versions are a little sportier. They also have the capri, which is sportier. But if you just want an easy sailor, get the 1986 model year. 

make sure it's got all it's rigging. mine did not. lots of controls were nonexistant, and i had to replace them, but catalinadirect.com has everything you'll need for a pretty good price.

I only payed 3k for mine, and it was in great shape. I lived aboard this past summer, so I think it's a great choice.

Just bear in mind that a bigboat and a dinghy sail very differently. much less feel on a keelboat then a dinghy. Laser's are all feel, you get way less on a cat22.","1414800701"

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","Ok, one last plea, and then I'll quit.

Ignore the term ""objectification"" for a moment. All that really matters are the consequences of our actions -- be they physical or emotional -- whatever they're called. Take this woman who walked around NYC for 10 hours and recorded video of all the catcalls she received. A lot of people don't understand the big deal. Most of the guys on the street were just saying, ""Have a nice day!"" or ""You look beautiful"" or whatever. Aren't those nice things to say? Why are people treating her like she's being harassed?

I think the concept that people are missing is that this sort of attention is not always wanted. It comes off as creepy, and often has the effect of making the subject nervous and upset. Making people nervous and upset is a bad thing, and should be avoided. 

But wait...why should saying nice things make the subject nervous and upset? Isn't that her own fault? I think that it's easy to come to that conclusion if you reason about this robotically, but it's fallacious. Employing a little empathy reveals that it's not actually crazy to feel threatened by comments like that. She can't read their minds, so she has no way of knowing whether their intentions are good or bad. These men are strangers. They know absolutely *nothing* about her except that they'd like to bone her. This is something she definitely takes into account. She feels vulnerable. They could easily overpower her if they wanted. Will they? The overwhelming probability is that they will not, but still ... it happens to *somebody*, and it happens *all the time*. Will it be her? 

Now back to the concept of objectification. You said, ""I look at women all the time as sex objects... This does not mean that I can't see value in other aspects of somebodies personality..."". Ok, fine, but I don't think you're objectifying women here per se. No one says you can't appreciate attractive women that you see out in public, or that you're bad for being a horn dog. We all are. I'm willing to bet, though, that there is a ""Line of Creepiness"" that you don't cross. If you see an attractive woman in a social setting and you ask her if she wants to have a drink with you, that is totally acceptable. If you, as a total stranger, approach a woman who is *just walking down the street*, trying to get from A to B, and you make a compliment as a *transparently obvious sexual advance*, then you've crossed the line and 9 times out of 10 you will make her feel uncomfortable or even threatened. This is basic Human 101 stuff.

I hate to quote Wikipedia, but I'm going to quote Wikipedia:

&gt; In social philosophy, **objectification** means treating a person as a thing, without regard to their dignity.

Wikipedia has this to say about dignity:

&gt; Moral, ethical, legal, and political discussions use the concept of **dignity** to express the idea that a being has an innate right to be valued and to receive ethical treatment.

And it lists four main violations of dignity: humiliation, **objectification**, degradation, and dehumanization. These all sound like the same sort of thing, but they have very specific definitions in sociology that are somewhat different than how the words are used colloquially. 

And so I think there are a lot of people, including feminists, who think that you're objectifying someone any time you find them attractive and maybe look at them for two seconds. I would argue that that is normal and natural and no one should ever be ashamed of it. Catcalling strange women on the street is a different issue.

So what about fictional women like Samus? The reason I used the term *objectification*, in the case of the Samus death sequence in *Super Metroid* is that it literally treats her like a *thing* without regard to her dignity. Like, she's literally exploding, and the developers used that as an opportunity to show her undies. Like I said, it's the ultimate in not caring that she's *a person* who is *dying* and not just something to put your dick in. It really is a bizarre juxtaposition, if you think about it.

But she is a *fictional* person, right? She doesn't have feelings.

Yeah, but if you make it seem acceptable to treat fictional women in this way, it can carry over into how people treat real women.","1414800702"

"brisbane","t5_2qutz","They sold the rights for the stops at the airport to a private company who can charge what they like instead of sticking to Translink's (regular public transport company) fee structure.

It's $16.50 to get to the city from the airport. It's not especially far or anything, they just gouge like hell. You can go to the stops before the airport for much less, but as soon as you hit the Domestic or International airport stops there's an extra charge of around $15 on top of your regular fare.

If you want to go further than the city, Translink's fee structure kicks in - with Translink paper tickets are more expensive than if you use a ""Go Card"". If you're taking public transport often you really need to have a Go Card, but the deposit is $10 (I think you can get that back at the end?). 

What that means is when I got to the station at the airport for the first time, I forked over $30 to get the card and charge it enough to get away from the airport. By the time I got where I was going the card was empty anyway.

To avoid this public transport travesty, you can take a complimentary bus from the airport to the DFO (shopping mall near airport) and take the Translink buses from there, or get someone/a shuttle service to pick you up.","1414800705"

A little more information would help, what exactly are you trying to do?

What are you using the rectangles for? What are they going to do? Likely they are a game object, which means you should just go ahead and use the Sprite class which makes everything a bit easier for you.

First you create your object class, inheriting the sprite class so that your class is a subset of sprite. 

Your __init__ code will contain the code that assigns the rect each object that is created.

Finally, you can use the groups that's part of Sprites and easily check for whatever you want for the whole group at once.

If you need to create a bunch of objects at once for some reason you can just put another loop inside your main game loop, but generally you'll only be creating objects when an event occurs, like a timer or button press etc. so you just make a call to your object class.

"privacy","t5_2qhlc","&gt; The board, imo, avoids corruption simply because all decisions are made by consensus. No one board member can make decisions regarding the network. 

So there won't be corruption because corrupt members will be voted out? Sounds great in theory, but if anything the real world shows that ""relying on consensus"" is not a guarantee. Many governments around the world show this.

&gt; As for how decisions will be carried out all I can say is that at no time will one or even two people have unilateral control over the network. I think some version of secret sharing sounds like a good idea but to be honest we haven't gotten that far.

You probably need to. Decisions about how the network is to be controlled should be part of your design specifications. Security of that nature needs to be embedded into the code, or it's easily bypassed.

&gt; Most people just say ""just use TOR"". I personally think that TOR wasn't designed for this application, that currently TOR has some issues that make me bet/risk my safety or anyone else's safety on it, and I think, for the type of application I'm planning that I can do it better than simply using voip over TOR.

I get that you're concerned about ""evil exit nodes"" and the latency issue with trying to use Tor. However, outside of those two concerns (which you plan on alleviating by running your own servers) are there any other problems with Tor?

In particular, if you just used the Tor software but tweaked it to connect only to your network rather than to the Tor network, would that be sufficient for you? Or are there other concerns? Tweaking the Tor software seems the simplest way to implement what you want (with the exception that it has no feature for central control).","1414800708"
"law","t5_2qh9k","Edit: Are you a lawyer or not? Your post history indicates you're still in university, and that you're either 21 or 22. And some other things that give a little insight to your responses in this thread.

&gt;to defend somebody you must take his word when he claims innocence

Why?

&gt;I just don't feel an attorney can do his utmost best if he 100% doesn't believe his client is innocent before proven guilty.

Why do you feel this way?

&gt;we must do whatever we can to ensure we get them acquitted. This is the first step to upholding justice.

Why? How did you come to this understanding of criminal defense? 

&gt;by holding this negatively framed idea of defence [not believing your client's innocence], we are simply playing with lives to satisfy our own conscience, which is morally wrong.

How so?

&gt;If the defence counsel is even 1% sure his client is guilty, he is denying his own client the right to a fair process, because even he does not believe 100% his client is innocent.

How is the right to fair process tied to a defendant's *actual* guilt or innocence, let alone his attorney's belief of same? 

I honestly am having trouble coming up with an answer to some of your other posts because it seems like you're being antagonistic. Your posts imply that you feel that defense attorneys are ""monsters"". Your posts also imply that you don't have a very strong grasp on the duties of criminal defense attorneys (implying it's a ""moral dilemma"" to represent those accused of heinous crimes). Then, you suggest that defense attorneys who don't believe their client's innocence deliberately perform worse than they would otherwise; not even just deliberately, but by **nature** they must perform worse. But you have no explanation of why.

If I seem to have attitude, it's because your posts come off as ignorant and because you justify everything you've said with ""I feel that way"" and nothing people can actually address in response. You make a lot of claims with nothing to back them up except your feelings, and respond to criticism of those claims with MORE claims which rely on your feelings. It's not conducive to the debate you're looking for.","1414800708"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","The important thing that this video (and most of the guys who don't believe what happened in the original video was harassment) ignores is the power dynamics at play here. The guy in this video is free to ignore the comments he's received because he's not a member of a social group that has been sexualized and objectified against their will pretty much since modern societies have existed. He is also bigger and stronger than pretty much everyone that made any kind of remark to him.

It's presented as though this video proves a point, but really it completely ignores the CONTEXT at play which basically WAS the entire point of the original. Also it's probably fake but whatevs

EDIT: Okay, I think I've pinpointed what really bothers me about this video. If you look at the female reactions to the previous one the majority of women sympathize with the woman being harassed and agree that it's harassment. When a woman (or anybody, for that matter) tells you that something makes her uncomfortable or threatened, she's not asking you whether or not she should feel that way; she's telling you that it DOES make her feel that way. The guys in this video and the guys who feel the same way as them are looking at the situation from their OWN perspectives and that's why they're completely missing the context that makes the scenario so uncomfortable FOR WOMEN. I know that, to a guy, the notion of a ""compliment"" being threatening is hard to understand, but your own lack of perspective and/or empathy doesn't negate or diminish her actual experiences. If what she's telling you makes you defensive, or you feel the need to question the legitimacy of her fear, you need to think really hard about why you feel that urge.","1414800713"

"rule34","t5_2qkd7","Creating torrents is easy and torrents have many legit reasons for use, your case being one (sharing files cheaply with friends).

If you're new to torrenting I'd recommend Deluge http://deluge-torrent.org/. Here is some instructions to create torrent with Deluge (assuming Windows):

1. Open Deluge
2. Click on File (top left) &gt; Create Torrent
3. Click Folder and navigate to folder containing all the goods &gt; Click Open
4. Click Trackers &gt; Add &gt; udp://open.demonii.com:1337/ &gt; OK
5. Click Options &gt; Select a Piece Size of 4MiB (depends on size of upload, in your case 12GiB) &gt; Check Add this torrent to the session
6. Click Save put the torrent file on Desktop (or other easy to reach/remember place)
7. You should now also have one active torrent &gt; Select it &gt; Select the details tab &gt; Find the Hash (it'll be a long string of numbers and letters)
8. Copy the hash and come back post it here in this form

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:[hash replaces these brackets]&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337

For example:

Given hash: vcn6idhbogrbiqqagcillxu5c55eoskr

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:vcn6idhbogrbiqqagcillxu5c55eoskr&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337

However if you have American (slow upload) internet MEGA or other file hoster would be better as it would allow others to download as fast as MEGA (or other file host) dictates instead of your ISP (at least for first peer upload). I don't know anything about size limits on file host though or other limits.

* Remember when I said ""You don't need ALL THE GEAR""? Seriously... you don't need that lens. You haven't even used that 70-200 that much. 

* You're going to lug your camera with you wherever you go and people will look at you. Get over it. 

* You're going to get flipped off when wandering the streets with your camera. Get over that too. They're on meth. That's what those people will do.

What helped me and I am in no way a good PVP player but I have gotten better after Bad Juju and thorn bounties is to slow down. Use the radar, special weapons like the fusion rifle and shotgun are very forgiving. Knowing the maps and where heavy weapons drop are key in doing better.

These days, sex usually happens pretty quickly - sometimes on a first date - but feelings can still catch me by surprise. If I sleep with someone consistently, I usually want a deeper connection.

Anyway, I think this is the kind of thing you have to learn by experience. Now you know what works for you, and you can change your approach next time. Or you may change again - but don't expect it or push yourself into anything that makes you uncomfortable.","1414800719"

I have had the same experience though. I've been running Arch for over a year at work and home and have had very few problems, none caused by Arch.

I switched from Fedora after being `fed-up` with upgrading every ~6 months (took over an hour, which is 3 times what it takes to install fresh).

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","There's no problem with that. To some there is, of course, because idiots will be idiots. But do you honestly believe that gamergate could be the force that it is fueled by fear-driven advocacy against progression and diversification?

Gone home was a bad game in a gameplay-mechanics, challenge-and-reward, fun kind of way. You know, the stuff the hard core of the gamer demographic cares about. The people who don't consider farmville or bejeweled a ""real"" video game. And most of those people don't have a problem that it exists. They have a problem with reading praise upon praise about it from outlets who's target demographic *are those core-gamers*, and then buying a game that sucks, because people couldn't can their social agendas enough to report something remotely useful. That's what they are pissed about when they say they want the ideologies out.

*edit: I realize that gone home was a shit example to illustrate this, and you've all made excellent points defending it. My use of this example has created a lot of arguing besides my point, to all of which I would like to reply but don't have the time. But while OP is a serious faggot, most of you have been very nice and illuminating towards your perspective and I wanted to appreciate that in written word.*

It's sad that people often mistake this to mean that gamers are afraid of progressive views or sensitive topics in their medium. I think most of them welcome it. The cry for better writing in video games is an old one. It takes a special kind bigot to prefer a bad story over a good story simply because it massages your prejudices, and painting the entire core of the gamer-sphere with that brush based on a misunderstanding is what pisses them off even more.

I believe you can inject your personal ideology into your reporting, even reviewing, and still possess the rhetoric skills communicate to the reader where this ends, and factual reporting begins. That doesn't even mean splitting your review up by those things, it just means good writing that is useful even to people that don't believe the exact same things you believe.

The trend, we fear, goes into the opposite direction, however. Not only are views forced upon the reader with authoritative language unchallenged by even experiments in perspective, assumed opposing views are slandered and judged from the get-go.

The real cause for this, as I see it, is the internet and it's evolution into the tyranny of the loudest. Trolling for attention. Clickbait as sustenance. Sensationalism as groundwork. And I digress quite heavily. The point is, the inevitable effect to this cause is the current state of gamergate. ","1414800724"

Try spending/scheduling some time every day orchestrating the conditions of success. This isn't about sheer willpower. 

It's easy to make resolutions when feeling aversion but difficult to keep them when that aversion inevitably subsides and is replaced by indifference or craving. Likewise, craving is transient and cannot be relied upon. There is no substitute for right view and daily effort.

Willpower is fickle, it comes and goes. When you have it, use it to plan and train for when it ebbs. Increase your odds of success with the means available, including: education, intelligent strategies, and sustained practice to rewire and strengthen your mind.

Some suggestions (mileage may vary):

* **Meditate** on a regular basis to strengthen your mind. You're going to be running a mental marathon and training your mental muscles and gathering some insight into the nature of craving and aversion will help. I cannot overemphasize this one, as it will also help to deal with anxiety and other psychopathologies. If you're unfamiliar with this territory, Sam Harris has some nice guided meditation audio [here](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/mindfulness-meditation). Also, Matthieu Ricard has a good one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFQ6Z1LG0xQ).
* Start introspecting your urges as described [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-connection/200901/unleashing-the-power-emotional-connection) and in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Lg9P-VekA).
* Educate yourself on the implications of PMO. Good starts are the videos and articles [here](http://yourbrainonporn.com/) and [this](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/10/09/how-to-quit-porn/) series.
* Consider taking up healthy pastimes and projects to spend time and energy on.
* Cold showers may be a good way to defuse and build up some mental fortitude. See [here](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/).
* Delete any triggering material you have on your electronic devices.
* Install and configure [K9 Web Protection](http://www1.k9webprotection.com/) to block pornographic material (or [Net Nanny](http://www.netnanny.com/) if you don't mind investing a few dollars). For mobile devices, find an equivalent Parental Controls application. Use a [disposable email address](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) and create a complex password which is difficult to memorize, write copies of that password on paper, and store the copies offsite (e.g. work, someone else's place). That way you can reconfigure K9 if you have to, but not so easily that it facilitates relapse.
* Consider doing a full reboot as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4yx4ouxGbQ).
* Don't get shaken by flatlines. Redditors often report relapsing after testing their flatline with PMO; something entirely pointless, as PMO is a false positive anyways. Make the most of a flatline by using it as a precious opportunity to prepare for when it ends and you have to devote energy to resisting the temptation to PMO.
* Consider the many useful tips and tricks [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1tejif/the_big_list_of_tips_tricks/).
* If streaks are a big deal for you, consider tracking your progress in a spreadsheet. With a spreadsheet you can see how you are doing over time across relapses.

As most (if not all) Fapstronauts know, relapsing is often part of the process. Of course, we take as many reasonable measures as we can to avoid relapsing, but when we do relapse it's important to remind ourselves:

* The goal is mental well-being and non-exploitation, not a badge number or streak.
* Failure and course-correction are a part of skill acquisition. Abstaining from PMO is a skill that will take time and effort to acquire, but will also serve you well in many other ways. I think this is largely why people on this forum often report many other benefits coinciding with their efforts.
* Guilt over relapsing may actually be working contrary to your goals, as strong emotions coinciding with PMO may reinforce neural pathways. Work through it as objectively as you can. Meditation can help here also.

At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether your life is overall better when you aren't engaging in PMO, even if you are relapsing. Even with relapses, if you're getting good days and streaks, those are sufficient warrant in and of themselves.","1414800727"

It's not a requirement to upgrade your ult.  It's something you do with bonus tokens and if you don't have anything else to spend ES on.  If red raids ""require"" you to have a maxed ult, that is a problem with red raids, not with ults, and the requirement needs to be made more realistic.

However, that brings up another problem (e.g., if you lower it to where it isn't mandatory to have level 20 ult, then group WITH level 20 ults can faceroll it).  Frankly, I actually wish the ability to ult was removed entirely from raids.  I feel like it unfairly balances hero desirability in favor of those with ""good"" ults.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","The point is that they don't follow the same rules as the Bitcoin blockchain.

The sending is governed by a ""two-way peg"" that converts BTC into the sidechain token. This peg can be any mathematical function that you can code. BTC are locked on the Bitcoin blockchain when sent to the sidechain. The totality of the sidechains assets should match the value of the locked BTC assets, otherwise a run will happen on the sidechain tokens. That would result in some people left holding the bag of sidechain tokens with no possible way to redeem them for real BTC.

The simplest way to ensure that doesn't happen is to make the peg exchangeable on a percentage basis. Like 1% of all sidechain assets can be destroyed for 1% of all the bitcoins that were locked to create those sidechain assets.","1414800735"

The max will depend on a percentage of the cap so when LeBron and Love wants to sign that new contract the max won't be ~20M but maybe 25-30M (I'm just throing numbers out there). It will scale accordingly with the cap and Varejao will still be a hit. I'll give you hometown favorite but that's just speaks to that it's a bad contract when you have to defend it with that. There's other players around the league that you can pick up and that will give you better production. Asik is a FA after this season, why not have a run at him? He don't want any touches at all on the offensive end anyway. You have Perkins that will do just what you what, play hard defense and set nasty screens. 

Varejaos seasons:


Season | GP | GS
---|---|----
10-11 | 31 | 31
11-12 | 25 | 25
12-13| 25 | 25

"NFLNoobs","t5_326ue","The 7 guys normally ""in the box"" on a typical defense are either 4 linemen and 3 linebackers (called the 4-3), or 3 linemen and 4 linebackers (called the 3-4).  But you can also think of it as 3 linemen, 3 linebackers, and 1 dual role.  So to some degree, it's just nomenclature issues.  There are so many different ways that teams present the standard defenses that roles can be a bit fluid and make position naming weird.  I think the literal difference between a lineman and a linebacker in this case is the stance when the ball is hiked, and linebackers sometimes play further back whereas linemen are on the line.  So what do you call that 4th linebacker who lines up on the line... but doesn't go into the 3 point stance... but then PLAYS like he's a fourth lineman?  What do you call him on the next down when he drops back into coverage?   Or when they switch to a nickle defense and he DOES drop into a 3 point stance and play as a pure lineman?

On the offensive side, you've got something similar -- a tight end is basically a dual role between lineman and wide receiver.  A fullback's role can be super-varied as well. ","1414800738"

Ozil pestered me for a move away in December [I'd been playing him less because Cazorla was having a brilliant first half of the season].  I gave him a few games to quiet him down, and he eventually resettled.  Played him in the CL Final against Madrid.  We went two up, Madrid netted two quickly thereafter.  Ramsey gave away a penalty.  Fuck me.

3-2 to Madrid, Ozil promptly goes into ""Go fuck yourself Madrid"" mode and scores a steaming header from the edge of the keeper's box.

He then hits a volley off an Ox cross mid-stride, wrongfooted, right in the back of the net.  You brilliant little German twat!


He then threads Walcott through for the 4th, putting me ahead.  Madrid are pressing high up the pitch, despite having two players sent off [Go fuck yourself Ramos] and as if it make his point, Mesut breaks free of Varene on the left wing, receiving a wonderful threaded ball from Walcott, returning the favor -- and dinks one over Casillas.

You get an ATM card that has zero transaction fee and at the end of the month they rebate your ATM fees.  Also I find Schwalb to have great customer service.

Once you have that go to Bangkok Bank at 333 Silom.  I did this a few years ago and it was easy to open an account.   If you do get an account here, you then take your Schwalb ATM card and withdraw 25000 baht, and put it into your account, this way you are not abusing Schwab's generosity, which could potentially effect me.

Finally, if you spend lots of time in Thailand, you can set up a ACH transfer with Schwalb and Bangkok Bank in New York.  It helps to be in Thailand when you do this as two small deposits will be made into your account, and you need to know the exact amount, and BKK bank in New York will not tell you ","1414800741"

"science","t5_mouw","I tend to agree, and the article does put forward that argument. However, another possibility discussed is that simply being labeled and treated in a certain way, either by given certain medications or being put in a certain environment can have a detrimental effect. Here is a quote from an editorial in the journal the article is based on:

&gt; The authors understandably caution that “the association is likely one of selection (rather than causation), in that people with increasing levels of psychiatric contact also are more severely at risk of dying from suicide”. This is undoubtedly part of the reason for the association, but it is not possible to be sure that an element of causation may not also be contributing.
Associations that are strong, demonstrate a dose–effect relationship, and have a plausible mechanism are more likely to indicate a causal relationship than associations that lack these characteristics [14]. There is now little doubt that suicide is associated with both stigma [15] and trauma [16] in the general community. It is therefore entirely plausible that the stigma and trauma inherent in (particularly involuntary) psychiatric treatment might, in already vulnerable individuals, contribute to some suicides. We believe it is likely that a proportion of people who suicide during or after an admission to hospital do so because of factors inherent in that hospitalization. Such suicides ought to be regarded as nosocomial. Perhaps some aspects of even outpatient psychiatric contact are suicidogenic. These strong stepwise associations urge that we pay closer attention to this troubling possibility.

Whatever things. Just go and make your own experience. Supplement it with whatever you want to. Crafting? Sure! Gathering? If you want. It finds ways to make even the smallest things, like mining ore, engaging without becoming tiresome.

It also does rewards well. There's a bunch of different currencies you can be earning to make any given action worth it, even if you've done it a hundred times already. You have to hunt down the challenges to get the big rewards, but there are plenty of smaller rewards along the way. ","1414800748"

"bad_religion","t5_2yu3u","&gt;Yeah, it's almost as if Christianity says that not every religion is true...And that consequently missions and the drawing in of new people into the body of Christ is a major imperative in Christianity.

That's the sort of exclusivist attitude towards other religions that serves as impetus for some Hindus, such as the author of this piece, to be skeptical towards, to dissect or scrutinize, these official messages, whether from the Catholic Church or the official bodies of other denominations, and efforts consisting in ""missions and outreach"" to Hindus, even those supposedly of an ecumenical nature. To be fair, a press release from the Vatican hardly matters to or even enters the awareness of most Hindus, so I do regard the author as extending undue importance to and being overly critical of a trifling, largely perfunctory and benign, gesture.

I did find the Vatican's admonition against the ""privatization of religion"" to be rather self-serving. For one, it is basically irrelevant to most Hindus for whom religion is principally a private affair, as the author notes. We have no ""imperative"" to draw converts from other religions and to work towards their demise; by and large, Hindus are content to let others maintain their existing religious beliefs as we seek to pursue our own religious obligations and practice. Second, the entrenchment of secularism as a constitutional principle and the advance of irreligion in large parts of the West has, of course, had a significant diminishing effect on the Church's influence in politics and in the public sphere. It's no surprise then that it would bemoan religion increasingly becoming a private matter. I find that to be a very positive development and pray for its continuation, not just as a Hindu living in the US, as a member of a religious minority here, but as someone who values secularism, whether in the West or in India.

&gt; SHELDON KRIMSKY: The Europeans operate on the precautionary principle. They say, if you introduce a new product on the market, you should evaluate it before the consumers get a chance to purchase it. In America, we made a decision that genetically modified foods are safe before you even have to test it. So the government never required tests for GMOs in the United States.

&gt; AMY GOODMAN: Who made that decision?

&gt; SHELDON KRIMSKY: Well, that decision was made by a commission, first of all, in the United States headed by Dan Quayle, and then it was—

That is a gross misrepresentation. Foods do not need specific safety testing *if* they meet the requirement of ""substantial equivalence""... which requires substantial study to determine, since not all GMOs meet that criteria. According to a [2003 review paper](http://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/abstract/S0167-7799%2803%2900227-0?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0167779903002270%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), standard testing includes:

&gt;* Study of the introduced DNA and the new proteins or metabolites that it produces;  
* Analysis of the chemical composition of the relevant plant parts, measuring nutrients, anti-nutrients as well as any natural toxins or known allergens;  
* Assess the risk of gene transfer from the food to microorganisms in the human gut;  
* Study the possibility that any new components in the food might be allergens;  
* Estimate how much of a normal diet the food will make up;  
* Estimate any toxicological or nutritional problems revealed by this data in light of data on equivalent foods;  
* Additional animal toxicity tests if there is the possibility that the food might pose a risk.

Oh, and while Dan ""Quayleism"" Quayle may have made the announcement, it was the FDA who developed the policy. A policy which was consistent with the evidence available at the time, and which is in line with the evidence available today. The misrepresentation (""no testing required"") might sound like a Dan Quayle idea, but the actual [FDA policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20050611233756/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~acrobat/fr920529.pdf) is a *bit* more comprehensive.","1414800751"

Now my emotional investment wasn't too large (i.e. I didn't wait months/years to tell my feelings), so as of now we're still friends, but yeah, ultimately this is how I took it. I lost interest.

I do not dwell on either her explanations were sincere or not, some were, some were not perhaps, but who cares, I take what I want (the positives) and move on. In the end of it all, I think that even though I failed to have a relationship with her, she ended up having more respect towards me for my courage (and me myself also have gotten more confident because of this) and just....I don't know...plainly accepted, that in the end, we wanted different things and that's all there is to it.

Not saying I wasn't hurt, it stinged a lot at first, considering that I really, genuinely thought that everything was falling into place, apparently no, so you can only imagine the disappointment.... but yeah, boom, just as her rejection, I lost interest, I've stopped putting her on a pedestal and am now working on myself :)","1414800754"

* Creativity

Programming and mathematics would fall under natural language processing and creativity. 

Software engineering is more about translating human requirements into a product than anything else, and machines will need to understand humans before they pose any serious threat to developers.

Mathematics, on the other hand, is much more difficult than you might believe. There's very few people on Earth who are good at it, and even less people who are any good at solving theorems. Check out [this](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hvv/progress_on_automated_mathematical_theorem_proving/) thread on progress in theorem proving.

&gt;Williams was nominated for the [Academy Award for Best Actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor) three times and won the [Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor) for his performance as therapist Dr. Sean Maguire in *Good Will Hunting*.

Then, many people go to college and do more walking/biking than they will after they graduate.  Young people's jobs are often more physical (unloading/loading; retail; packing; fulfillment centers).  The ones that go directly into telemarketing or other sit-around jobs gain weight the fastest.

People think they can keep eating like they did when they were on junior varsity Whatever Team.  They were probably already a little plump.  But at 2-3 lbs extra per year, from age 24-30, that's easily 14-20 lbs.  Enough to be flat out overweight.  Many gain more.

It is not a swamp cooler, it does not pull air through a wet mesh.  These are used to reject heat out of an air conditioning system, the water is heated by the AC condenser (through a heat exchanger) and then pumped out to the cooling tower where it sheds heat.  The chilled water is then fed back to the condenser's heat exchanger.

First that depression is incredibly common so don't feel ashamed of it (Approximately 18.8 million American adults, or about 9.5 percent of the U.S. population age 18 and older in a given year, have a depressive disorder)

You just simply don't like it. Doesn't make it wrong.

Try replacing every instance of genital cutting with intact genital skin and then explain why the fact that you don't like intact genital skin should justify amputating it from children.

Your history appears to be shaky. The Jews are believed to have brought the practice of genital cutting with them from Egypt (where it was believed to be practiced voluntarily primarily by the priest class). Moses was not circumcised and only circumcised one of his sons, which was apparently done therapeutically. In the history of Judaism, infant genital cutting was not mandatory until Joshua instituted that reform as part of the war preparations for the conquest of Canaan.","1414800761"

Which is dumb!  When 4chan and the SJW crowd get into it, I agree 4chan is probably nastier, but you don't actually have to pick a side!  You can just call them both morons and keep holding reasonable opinions somewhere in the middle.  

Maybe, just maybe, gaming culture can be hostile to women and that's something we can work on.  Maybe some of the prominent feminists in the gaming community aren't very nice people.  Maybe threatening people is bad, but doesn't automatically invalidate every view the threatener holds.  Maybe video games do have a history of crappy female characters, and we should demand more when we notice it.  Maybe, all of that being true, women aren't systematically and intentionally oppressed in the first world, and sexism is a complicated, subtle, and many-sided topic that impacts everyone and needs to be addressed in ways that are more nuanced than just calling everyone who disagrees with you a rapist.

Or not.  You could also just pick a side and start repeating the rhetoric from one side of the asylum.  I guess that works too.        ","1414800761"

&gt;     513 are deceased
&gt;     1,637 have felony record, so they can't vote

&gt; 
&gt; Eleven other applications included no first or last name, according to Kemp.

&gt; **The list also included 9,990 pending applications, which means the form is incomplete. Those applicants have been notified by letter to finish their forms through their county election office.**

1. Water not soda or pop no energy drinks.  I suggest a green tea to break things up but just a touch of sugar if you need it not a lot.
2. Avoid junk food at all costs it will be worse off for you, stick with granola bars or healthy snacks as you play.
3. Start off with a nap prior to launch time and a healthy meal as well don't skimp because you will run out of gas faster than you think leveling through the night if that's your plan.  In fact having something prepared to eat and in the fridge takes time off your breaks in terms of food prep.  You can precook it and then nuke it to ready.
4. Finally take breaks, yes I mean this plan breaks in your game play and set a timers even in game /timer. I'd suggest every 2 hrs.  When you hit your time and do your quest turn in take your break, bio, stretch, fill your water glass eat if you haven't, but honestly get out of the chair and walk away.

I suspect majority of your use cases will be users visiting the site to search for and read already existing reviews. I suggest placing gym review searching / filtering options right at the top of the page. The slide at the top of the page could also serve as a selection of reviewed gyms.

You should also look into giving users the ability to search for and pinpoint the gym on a map. Currently, if I click on a gym name I am redirected to a Google Search page for that particular gym. In some cases this did not yield beneficial results at all. If you want the slideshow to be a list of reviewed gyms with photos, you will have to give users the option to upload a picture of their gym.

Regarding the design of the site - it isn't very unique. Explore entirely custom Wordpress theme creation and get experimenting. Think about your key functionalities and how to best display them and guide the user through them, visually.

Take the most extreme views of both videos and toss them out. How about instead of people living in a bubble where 'they shouldn't have to worry about people talking to them' we engage with each other? 

Ignore the people just saying something for the sake of talking and engage the people that are engaging you. So when someone says 'Can my girlfriend get your number?' you respond with a simple 'Sorry, no.' Or if a guy is following you for 5 minutes you say 'Can you stop following me?'

People generally wait for a reaction before they know if what they are doing is wrong or not. Some people know that they are doing something wrong, and thats what gets them off - we can't help that, they will always exist. But, if we tell people not to be attracted to others, or not to approach other people **in any way** we become even more disconnected than facebook/twitter/reddit have already made us.","1414800769"

In that build I did cheap out a bit on the case; you could spend a bit more and get an s340 or other durable high-end mid tower.  Just depends on your budget and how much you want to invest now versus spend time upgrading in the future.

Since it's the only hour that your bosses might listen to, you want to make sure it's your best stuff.  Although you've been working in radio for almost 30 years, unfortunately it's impossible to find sixty minutes out of the 12+ hours of radio you do each week that could be considered 
 quality material.  Lucky for you the channel that bears your name broadcasts other shows (in addition to the show you host)  that you can use content from whenever there's not enough good material from your own show to fill an hour of quality material.

I want one. ","1414800779"
"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","Okay then, let me rephrase it. Let's say I want to have intimate, passionate sex. I want to have intimate, passionate sex with my wife because I love her and she's attractive to me. This desire for her exists as a default. Having her wear sexy clothes or send me suggestive texts or pics or whatever might help to make it stronger, but the basic want for her is already there. If this is how I feel and approach sex...then why doesn't my wife feel the same way? Why do I have to warm her engines, get her to a point that for me exists as the default? Think about everything this *suggests.* Now I'm older, more experienced, and I know better, but look around this sub and the number one complaint is that we don't feel desired, we wonder if our partners truly love us or care for us. Because that thing we call desire - that we have for them in default - they basically have to be manipulated into feeling.

Hell, even if I just want a quick, carnal fuck session - again, if this is something I want as a default state, now consider that again I have to warm her up to it which suggests that we're not fundamentally in the same place, and that is the problem.

&gt; Am I hearing this right, that you don't want to be the one helping her get turned on, having her respond to you, knowing that you put in the time and effort to know her body and mind well enough to share pleasure with her -- and vice versa? Because it's too much work?

No. What I am saying is that it's not our job to turn our partners on, nor is it something we can actually do. Every person is an individual with freedom of choice. If you can say ""fulfill these conditions to make me want X"", you can also make the conscious, personal choice to just do X without needing to be coaxed into it. I explained in another comment about how I sometimes leave my socks lying around the house, and my wife hates it. I can say ""well, if you gave me a BJ every time I properly put my socks away I'm sure I'd want to do it more"" but the counter-argument to that is ""why can't you take it upon yourself to just put your own socks away?"" Same deal.

Nothing we can do will make a person who doesn't want sex change their minds. The best we can hope for is coaxing someone who is on the fence about it. And that's not the kind of sexuality I want. I don't want to have to manipulate my wife into wanting to have sex with me, anymore than she wants to have to manipulate me into putting my socks away.

&gt; That 'all' she has to do is show up? (which isn't the case by the way, Just imagine the mental and physical buildup you'd have to do to drag yourself into bed for someone you really didn't want to do something so intimate with because they were guilting you into it!)

This is the entire reason I made this post. ""Drag yourself into bed"" already suggests negativity, something a person does not want to do. By us expecting sex from our partners we put them in that position. Even if we are justified in saying ""you owe me sex!"" that does nothing to actually make them want to have sex. 

I don't think I'm being unreasonable in asking a partner to take control of their own sexuality. I think the concept of needing to be put ""in the mood"" is bullshit. I mean, you wouldn't walk into a restaurant and say to the chef ""Well, I *might* be hungry...but I dunno. I could go for the chicken, but you're going to have to make me want to eat it."" Either you want it or you don't, and that's 100% your choice to make. ","1414800779"

"Goldfish","t5_2rmri","You'd probably have better luck in /r/aquariums. This subreddit is a bit on the slow side. I kind of an idea though. Sorry I don't have an exact answer with sources though. I'm guessing these recommended tank sizes take into consideration the potential adult size of the fish, its bioload, activity level, temperament, and others experiences.

 Goldfish are constantly eating and pooping so the bigger the water volume, the easier it is to maintain healthy parameters. Fancy goldfish can be anywhere from 6-12 inches while commons can grow well over a foot so some tank sizes can't physically contain them without discomfort or stunting. Gold's also tend to be pretty active in my experience and appreciate some room to swim and turn around in. 

Luckily, goldfish are rather peaceful so we don't have to be as mindful of territories since they actually like friends. This isn't so with all fish though. Physically, two male betta would be fine in a 20 gallon due to their size and bioload. But realistically, their temperament prevents it and most aquarist would not reccomend it. Over the years the hobby must have saw what did and didn't work with which fish and the numbers we have to today evolved from their past experiences.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Very interesting. I will say, men are raped rarely, as the article this cites says 1 in 71 are raped.

&lt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that when rape was defined as oral or anal penetration, one in 71 men said they had been raped or had been the target of attempted rape, usually by a man they knew. (The study did not include men in prison.)

And one in 21 said they had been forced to penetrate an acquaintance or a partner, usually a woman; had been the victim of an attempt to force penetration; or had been made to receive oral sex.&gt;

Whereas the next article that article links says &lt;Nearly one in five women surveyed said they had been raped or had experienced an attempted rape at some point, and one in four reported having been beaten by an intimate partner. One in six women have been stalked, according to the report.&gt;

I'm curious specifically about the situations where forced to penetrate occurs, as it's possible that other men, in certain social situations actually coerce each other to not be ""gay"" and engage in such behavior.

In any case, all rape is bad, but my central point is this video does a bad job of showing us why the original video is flawed. The original video showcases a serious problem, and this one misunderstands that.

The article the wiki page cites &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/health/as-victims-men-struggle-for-rape-awareness.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&gt;

And, as I often will wear one ear-bud and listen to music myself, I will tell my client before we get started that, ""I can still hear you if you need something, or feel like chatting for a bit; but overall I tend to get in a zone and not talk much.  Please don't be offended I just prefer to concentrate as much as possible.""

"kzoo","t5_2ryk4","&gt; So I'm a fool if I vote for the principles I believe are best for everyone. . .

No, the principles that are best for everyone would be principles that are pro-social, such as job-creation, health care, education, housing, and access to food and water. 

&gt; . . .instead of the politicians that will serve my own narrow, self interest? 

Are you saying that democrats have a more narrow self-interest than republicans? Or do you mean that voting a straight ticket in a two-party system is detrimental to any broad social reform?

Corruption, cronyism, and corporate favoritism are rife among both parties, but at *least* the dems make a show of trying to protect our natural resources, our children, and our elderly. The republicans, especially the tea party traitors, would throw them all to the wolves if it meant WalMart could make an extra half percent or so. ","1414800785"

I've been one of the most critical people towards Marty this year, but the reality is when you have a QB who can't take snaps under center, it basically cuts the playbook in half. Then, with half a playbook, you have to try and not only have a balanced offense (which in itself is more difficult because run plays are much harder to get significant yardage out of shotgun), while also trying not to become predictable.

Marty's red zone play-calling is pure garbage, there's no defending that, but this is a pretty shitty situation for anybody to be calling plays right now.","1414800786"

Then I decided I wanted a wire tuck done and didn't really know what I was doing. I got it done, everything worked and was hidden but it wasn't terribly pretty when you get to it. But then we had some major engine headaches and decided to change the management system over to Obd-1 and added a Rywire harness because the engine harness had brittle connectors and needed more wires for the obd1. 

Also all the AC has been deleted and the battery moved to the hatch.

So now its all over the shop. Because its an obd1 car, certain wires are outright not required. The Rywire harness has some wires I don't need (speedo drive is cable on this car for example) and because its a RHD car, the bulk of the wiring shares the same real estate as the steering column and pedals.

I want to get an auto elec to delete anything he can, make sure its thrash proof (It rides on very firm coilovers, rough roads shake the car hard.) and make it as tidy as possible. But the question is do I want to have the dash back in on monday or not.

"LoLChampConcepts","t5_2t7e7","Passive: Its an interesting one I'll give you that. I like how you played his name into his passive. Bonus points for creativity right there. Does it only work when its 109 units moved in one go? Or is that 109 units moved over time?

This loss of shared vision Im not much of a fan of. Because its a passive, you have no control over it, especially due to the fact that it can be activated by enemies attacking you. That very heavily leads in an anti-fun direction. But it seems more anti-fun for the person playing Cix than the other team as he is always going to lose vision, but only one person on their team may lose theirs unless others also attempt to attack him. How much is the loss of vision? And how long does the effect last for?

Q: While I do like the engage this move carries with his W, as well as the disengage and the synergy with his ult (you thought this one out well), I dont feel like the kick distance is very impactful. Singeds flip is 550 at all ranks and that doesnt feel like too far a distance most times. Yours doesnt even reach that. I feel it should be increased somewhat as Cix is going to rely on being in there and using Q to disrupt the enemy in some way.

W: This is a good move, thought out well with good active and counterplay involved. You activate it and run like crazy, which gives everyone the idea to start running away too. Then once youve used your disruptive abilities you start smoking everywhere, forcing the enemy to have reduced vision in your smog. How long does smog last for in areas you have left it?

E: Quite a high amount of damage if you build damage, although I feel that would be a great folly as this champ is very much a front and center champ. Again, this works well with his kit. Blends in with his W.

R: Everyone look out as Thomas is PISSED!! The huge wall, the knock aside, and the aoe damage off it, as well as the synergy with his Q makes this move highly dangerous. My only worry is, with the power that comes with this move at the later stages of the game, this could practically win a teamfight straight away. I do like how you have to position yourself correctly for it to work though. It involves a little bit more skill.

Theres only a couple things. This champ is designed to be built tanky. Yet you have given him huge Bonus/AD scalings. Yet most ad bruiser items wouldnt really work with his move set. I still am highly unsure about his passive vision loss. But, what I really admire about this champion is the evident thought that has gone into his kit, the synergy with it, and the counterplay that has gone into it. One of the better designs I have seen so far.","1414800796"

If the enemy is stronger lategame there is usually a point after which you are achieving less and less (you can still win the game, but from now on it gets harder, not easier). Usually loosing a big streak on a hero that has been dominating all game, a teamfight that you didn't win convincingly or a lost rosh are the first signs for this to happen. I think DP players now this very well.

You could easily see it with all the push-strats in 6.81. Now teams draft more with lategame-viability in mind, so it's not that obvious anymore.

It's also an advanced way of estimating item choices/builds/hero picks, that is asking yourself when you want your hero ""to peak""/to have the highest game impact, to win or to get a decisive lead. in 6.81 it was really important that every hero in the team reaches this point as simultaneously and quickly as possible to go for the deathball (which made drafting and item choices extremely important). 
Right now it seems less useful to strategise that way, because lategame always seems to be an option, so you have to think a lot more about what happens if certain heroes are gearcapped etc. ","1414800812"

He shouted. Loud. The beginning sounded like nonsense to her, but there was no question in the tone, it was a challenge, and a strong one at that. The thrill rose in her louder and louder. She smirked and lowered her head, perhaps looking submissive. Only for a moment before she began her own charge with head lowered and horns forward. As she had hoped, the broken earth game her small foot holds that let her push off harder than the flat earth would have, increasing her momentum.

She looked to deliver exactly what he wanted, the best strike she could think of using in this form, looking to ram into his midsection with her whole weight and moment.","1414800817"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","It's rather well-known (I think, anyway) that the brain stops developing around your mid-twenties, which is why teenagers and young adults are so much more ""reckless"" and impulsive than the older set.

A comparison can also be drawn to the ""critical period"" of language development in children - if they haven't started learning a language by 5 or 6, they probably never will. 

And [here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity#Applications_and_example) the Wikipedia page for neuroplasticity, which suggests that the brain can be somewhat ""rewired"" by turning a little used area into more ""processing power"" for an area of greater use.


And while my original claim isn't exactly supported by this, I still think my original point holds about grandpa not being able to learn how to program by willpower and gumption alone.

* First of all, BD sales of the anime weren't fantastic. This doesn't automatically kill shows, as the production committee model allows shortfalls to be made up with increased sales in other areas (such as the light novels) but it doesn't help
* Second, and tied into the first, the light novel series ended. There are no new books to sell, so the marginal value of the anime was reduced even further.
* Third, sequels inherently sell less copies as the show goes on - you're not attracting new viewers and you're losing old ones. Everyone involved in the project would make better returns by adapting something new and shiny.
* Fourth, the next arc after the anime finished (introduction of Cole) is too short to make a full series, but the one after that has no logical stopping point part way through, and takes up more light novels than were adapted in both seasons of the anime combined.","1414800822"

"toronto","t5_2qi63","Unfortunately it looks like the only solution to stopping these scam calls is to be dillegent in blocking them right after you recieve them. Never answer these numbers (or any numbers that seem fishy) and block scam numbers on your phone right after. Most smartphones these days have built-in call rejection options. If you post your number online to sites like Kijiji/craigslist, always ask people to text you if you don't want to deal with calls. It also makes dealing with scam calls easier.

Also, whenever I get a call from an unknown cell number I make it a point to look it up on the Internet before calling back. I know this is inefficient and stupid/potentially dangerous in some cases (could be a loved one in danger who needs you to pick up the phone urgently), but I do it because I have very few contacts in general. This isn't ideal for someone who actually uses their phone as a phone a lot. Unfortunately. 😔

Piccolo had a power level somewhere between 200 and 800 (based on the fact that he was stronger than Krillin who had 200, and weaker than Raditz, who had 1000. For the sake of having a number I'll give him 600) during the fight with Raditz he took off the weighted training clothes and 100 kilo was vaguely impressive. Later when he fought Frieza's second form and took it off for the second time, his power level had to have been over one million for him to have taken on Frieza like he did. This means he was at the very least 1666.66666 times stronger than he was when he took them off against Raditz.","1414800825"

"Nexus5","t5_2v4cu","This is reddit, nothing makes sense.

As to why he was probably stating random facts: the easiest way to get a response from anyone is by stating a random fact, but outside of the correct context. If I were to state that celery is green, at least someone would react, as it is a completely pointless statement in the current discussion. Sure, stating that Mr. Cook is gay surely is less innocent, but the idea remains the same.

I do agree however that the statement probably was just a childish reddit-reply; not a socio-political experiment. 

Finally, considering the taboo. One does indeed need to talk about the subject of the taboo in order to remove the negative connotations linked to that subject. This is completely logical.

But by creating instances of extreme positive connotation, the taboo can become even greater. This is nothing different from yelling ""hey guys, this taboo isn't that bad! It shouldn't be a taboo!"" it's easy to understand why this doesn't work. 

But don't get me wrong: I'm not saying people shouldn't inform others about homosexuality - my best friend is gay, so I know it's necessary - but that they should do it differently, and less extreme.

:----:|:---------:|:----:|:----:|:----:
Tongfu.W vs **LV** bo3 | 21%/79% | 6%/94% | Tongfu.W is a tier 3 Chinese team who consistently loses to the tier 2 teams, while LV is one of the best tier 2 teams who occasionally takes games of even the tier 1 teams. In a bo3 I would be *very* surprised if Tongfu.W pulled off an upset. Going big on LV. | **Won:** Well even though LV pulled it out in the end that series was a lot closer than I expected.
Navi.US vs **VP** ~~bo3~~ bo1 | 31%/69% | ~~22%/78%~~ 30%/70% | ~~I am not even convinced that Navi.US deserves 31% odds in a bo1 against VP, in a bo3 they absolutely don't. Big on VP.~~ Oh it *is* a bo1, odds make more sense now. Not really an edge here then but I already put my bet in on VP. | **Won:** Thank-you to Demon's Furion for the EZ value :D
bvd.black vs **CDEC** bo1 | 18%/82% | 10??%/90??% | OK I have absolutely no idea how strong bvd.black is so I am pulling those numbers out of my ass :D Basically I would be happily surprised if any African team is on the level of a team like CDEC. For now though I have to go with CDEC. | **Won:** Was anyone able to watch this game? How did bvd.black look?
Newbee vs **LGD** bo3 | 71%/29% | 55%/45% | Wow, these odds! Have people not been paying attention to Chinese dota recently? Any of the tier 1 teams (VG, IG, Newbee and LGD) can win against each other, their scene is really close right now. This is an easy big value bet on LGD, by far the best odds of the day. | **Won:** [345$ value!](http://imgur.com/kynBEbL)
Empire vs SNA bo3 | 79%/21% | 80%/20% | Odds seem about right for this one, can't see any particular edge so will be abstaining unless the odds shift.
**Mith** vs MVP.P bo1 | 44%/56% | 50%/50% | That one game from yesterday is not enough to convince me that the old MVP.P is back yet. Will be going medium on Mith. | **Lost**
Navi vs **Tinker** bo3 | 53%/47% | 40%/60% | I am glad to see bettors are still underrating Tinker on LAN. I will be going big on Tinker here. | **Lost**

I will be updating later on if new matches are added or odds change significantly. Good luck everyone!","1414800831"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","It does a *lot* of testing..

It was about a year ago when I covered this in college and I havent really looked at it since, but from memory it goes something like:

1) The power supply does its own test- it checks all the different components and makes sure everything is in order. Once thats done it sends a 'power good' signal to the CPU

2) CPU checks the various hardware to make sure everything functions right and checks if theres any DIP switches or jumper settings that need to be applied it happens here.

3) At this stage the individual bits hardware will do its own tests. Like some harddrives for example can do a self test and make sure there is no imminent failure about to happen.

4) Next it figures out where to boot from (CD/HD/USB/Network etc)

5) The BIOS has to go looking on the HD (or wherever) for the MBC/MBR and then find the active partition. Which finds the ntldr which then finds the boot.ini

6) At this point if you are dual booting, say windows and linux you will be offered the choice of which OS you want to load.

7) Then it starts loading the OS into RAM.

8) Next it goes to the Registry and looks for the hardware profile and starts loading the drivers.

9) Lastly it loads up winlogon which then loads up the LSASS which loads the login screen....","1414800832"

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","I'm not arguing for tickle down economics, I'm just arguing that someone else becoming richer doesn't make you poorer.

&gt; I'm not arguing that trade isn't mutually beneficial. I'm asking who it's beneficial for.

This is literally nonsense, it's beneficial to both parties or else it wouldn't be *mutually* beneficial. You can argue that one side benefits more than the other but that's entirely subjective. If someone is willing to pay $x amount for something then it must be worth at least $x to them.

&gt; It clearly isn't very beneficial for the working class considering production has increased dramatically since the 1970s but wages, adjusted for inflation, have only increased by 1%

Look, I don't think we really disagree all that much. The fact that production is increasing and people aren't becoming better off is a huge problem. But I don't agree that the mere existence of rich people is the cause.

&gt; Not to mention the free trade policy of America has shipped jobs overseas and has caused massive pollution from the shipping lanes between China and the US.

Seriously, any economist will tell you that protectionism does nothing but make people worse off and the best thing that could happen is free trade. Why are you okay with the government enacting policy to protect your wealth and job but when it's protections for the rich it's a problem. At least be consistent.

&gt; Capitalism has been a net lose for the working class. 

A net loss? Really? Humanity went from running around naked in the forest to skyscrapers and space travel under capitalism and you want to call it a net loss?!?! Being working class today is better than being the richest person alive 1000 years ago. That doesn't mean that thee aren't huge amounts of problems and that we can't strive for better but your delusional if you think it's a net loss. ","1414800833"

Except that Hannibal ""allegedly"" destroyed a city that is on the exact spot where there are the ruins of a city. *Many people throughout history have destroyed cities...*

Jesus ""allegedly"" raised people from the dead, magically transformed water into wine, walked on water, had a fight with Satan in the desert, feed thousands of people with 5 fish, Rose from the dead himself and then floated away into heaven.

One thing though, to build on what spacemanspar brought up, [the 'you have already logged in with this key, log out NOW' windows don't disappear either.](https://imgur.com/i6Dc4bV)  It reminds me of my desk; I have a bunch of papers that I never use, but they might be useful in the future, so I just pile them off on the side.  

Other things:

* I just noticed, I don't think you can progress through fax machines either, similarly to ATMs.  

* It would be nice if you could change the z-ordering of the windows by clicking on them, the way windows work in, well, Windows.  Right now the z-order is determined by the order they were opened in, which is not necessary ideal in all situations.  

* All the bugs from previous tests not yet fixed.  

All in all, multiple windows is a very useful feature that was much needed.  I can see things coming together, and I'm excited to see what the community will do with this!

0) Own it, apologize, undo or correct the mistake/make it top priority to fix, and outright change course as needed (in addition to using the information to improve in the future). AKA the response to the feedback about the Lee Sin rework proposal, and to some extent changes to the Smites on PBE.

Obviously, that isn't always possible. However, I think there's a bigger issue with two flavors of 1:

1.5a) Own it, apologize, take a very long time (the duration of ""a very long time"" being inversely proportional to how serious the problem is) to actually deliver improvement; give off impression of not actually trying to improve and insincerity in the apology meant to placate people.

1.5b) See feedback given beforehand, but be too far into development to bring back to the drawing board and give the impression of not listening while there's time to correct the mistake. Own it, apologize, try to use it to improve--but only once the mistake has already been made, giving the impression of an insincere apology meant to placate people. (This is mostly in regards to disputed reworks/nerfs/buffs.)

Obviously there are cases where we see a potential mistake that turns out to be a great decision, but we have no way to tell whether a controversial decision will work, not work, or work with some corrective balance changes (which I sort of think is a problem but am not 100% sure how to solve.)

I feel like we could use more cases like the Let's Talk about Xerath thread on the old NA forums--where we're getting constant feedback about what's going on with the rework, feedback about what made Xerath actually fun was incorporated when possible, and we got hilarious testing screenshots to boot. I know that approach has sometimes backfired, but that seems to more be due to communications breakdown (read: Olaf's rework, Skarner's first rework) than anything else.

I definitely have overall liked more than disliked the degree of communication so far--but we can still improve.","1414800846"

The new NaVi squad couldnt perform at their previous level and v1lat's interview information leaked that one of the players didn't get along in the team. As a result, after another failure at a major tournament  a decision of a switch has been made.

The choice fell on experienced Goblak, who has experience working with NaVi and not so long ago was the coach of this team at TI4. Now he will be a player and the captain of the team. Who did he replace? At the present moment we didn't receive any official information from NaVi but we're expecting it in the near future.

Information about the further fate of VPP we will disclose later.

 Глеб «Funn1k» Липатников

Your index finger have a fairly wide range of movement that allows you to reach the middle note. Shift your fingers and thumbs accordingly depending on the size of your phone. It should be fairly comfortable such that even if you grab your phone in this position, you can still keep on playing without dropping your phone and turning it into an expensive brick.

In this position, I can reach the 3rd/7th positions with my right/left fingers respectively, but I need to stretch my fingers to the maximum to reach it, making me sometimes screw up because of missed positioning. So to play with my ""hover"" posture, I rotate my hands so my palms are facing away from the screen. Fingers keep their same positions as before. Now the index fingers have a longer reach without being fully outstretched. ","1414800850"

He was more like a lich, a lich uses his power to bring eternal life by binding their soul to a body. Liches can also bring the dead back to life, such as Jesus did to Lazarus.

Either way, a PB with high absorb chance is amazing in the end game areas where pretty much everyone is shooting lasers at you.  

Unfortunately the bonus laser damage is bugged so it doesn't actually apply, but hopefully that gets fixed.  Either way absorbing laser ammo makes it one of the best shields imo.","1414800851"

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","OK, I've got a minute, but my mother-in-law is having some problems so I have to make this very short.

 I can't address everything you wrote because I have to tend to my mil, but here are a few quick comments. And then I think we should just close the discussion.

1)  have you ever studied ibn arabi's teachings on hell (the levels of hell, etc? 

2)  do you really believe hell is literally made of fire? or paradise filled with houris?  

3)  the quran says many times that people will not be unfairly ""punished"".  again this is where i bring up people commonly reporting during an nde a life review.  they feel all the things that happened in their lives, but also how it effected others.  when we talk about disbelievers of muhammad's time, it wasn't the kind and friendly neo-pagan community of our times; it was people who were torturing their wives, fighting viciously with each other, etc.. This is what they would feel in the afterlife.  So someone who beat the crap out of his wife would feel what his wife felt.  how many people say that in courts....i hope he will feel what the victim felt.  

4) i would hope that people would feel remorse after they commit crimes against other beings, wouldn't you.  

5)  shirk: the worst shirk of all is to make an idol of one's self, allowing arrogance, greed, etc, to get in the way of being a good person.  muslims often call people of other religions guilty of shirk and they aren't!  hindus and even wiccans who believe in the One Supreme Being!  Only the One Supreme Being can judge the heart and know how the relationship with the Divine is. People calling each other unbelievers: the Quran and hadith also say that is wrong.  If you believe there is no reality but One Reality, you stop insulting other people's beliefs.

6)  Contradictions teach us by making us think/reason/explore/contemplate/gain knowledge.  And what often looks contradictory is actually not.  Its the illusion of duality where there is actually only non-duality.  There is no reality but One Reality.

7)  Ibn Kathir's exegesis comes from the mind not the heart and soul.  Love is not a mind thing.

8)  .Are you asking me about fate?  Our fate is to return to Eternal and Infinite Love and Light.  Read some NDEs and it isn't only Muslims who have NDEs.  Its everyone, including atheists.  I'm sick of scientists blowing them off.  People don't fire off Love like that.  These people come back **knowing this Love is ""God""**

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Um, black hole theory falls under General Relativity, not Special Relativity.
If you need an easy way to remember General Relativity deals with what you would normally think of as Gravity. (actually the curvature of spacetime around massive objects, a black hole being an extreme case of the bending of spacetime)

Special Relativity, on the other hand, deals with speeds approaching the speed of light. It would only be tangentially related to the basic study of black holes. 

By the way, did you know that GPS systems use both general and special relativity to work?  You could navigate to the moon using only newtonian mechanics, but in order for your GPS to get you from your house, to say, your favorite restaurant you need both general and special relativity. General relativity to know that the perception of time on earth is different than the perception of time on a satellite, because GPS depends on very precise timing of signal communication.

A Physics 101 professor would probably give you a good explanation of Newtonian gravitational theory, which works for everything but extreme cases of spacetime curvature or very accurate measurements. But a good Physics 101 professor would give explain that these limitations, and give you a general idea of the basics of General Relativity. A very good professor (Richard Feynmann, Carl Sagan, Neil Degrasse Tyson) could explain some of the more interesting parts of General relativity and black holes.  

But **here is the big difference** Any professor (I have met more than a few physics professors) would want to tell you as much as you could possibly understand and be interested in. They would explain things to you *in the hopes that it would catch your interest enough to want to learn more.*   There are no closed doors in physics, there is no field to which leading physicists tell you not to study. There are prerequisites, usually they are very specific.  ""Well, that is as much as I can explain now, but if you learn muliti-dimensional calculus and take a couple semesters of basic physics, come back, and I will teach you more.""  

You cannot say the same thing about the LDS church. They tell you not to study things, try to limit your sources of information, and try to rationalize rather than inform.  They are much more like Pascal, who knew about irrational numbers, but tried to hide their existence from his students. 

Information is good, critical thinking skills are good, inspiring people to learn is good, encouraging people to seek out truth is good, and finally, teaching people concrete, reproducible, systematic ways to find truth is good.

Hiding information to manipulate people is not good, trying to pacify people with half truths and purposefully vague explanations is not good.","1414800863"
"Brazil","t5_2qmku","I don't really agree about the two prices thing or about being scammed by everyone. I'm as gringo as they come and I rarely have problems. I'm on a vacation now with my girlfriend (she's American) and we've been here for a couple of months.

So far, we only got scammed once by some creep at the beach who did her a henna tattoo without telling us how much he was going to charge and then asked for R$100. In the end, she reluctantly ended up paying him R$50. I was about to give him R$15 and tell him to fuck off, but this is certainly a bad move. 

When buying things at street markets and at the beach, there are a few simple things you can do to ensure you get the best prices. First and foremost, you should almost always avoid anyone who speaks English unless you really need their specific products. These guys are pros and will always try to get the maximum from tourists. Only speak in Portuguese and always offer a lower amount, unless it's something like food or drink. I do this with pretty much everything I buy. Vendors will often tell you they can't accept the offer because they won't make any money on it - walk away when they say this and you'll see if they're being honest. Another trick is to say ""Well I paid that amount for one yesterday, so no thank you"". Last night at Copacabana a guy had some really nice fake Oakley sunglasses (lol, yes I like 'em) and tried to sell them to me for R$70. Of course I was like ""No man I can buy these for only R$20 at Vinte Cinco de Março in SP and there's no way I'll pay more than that"". I know that they actually only pay around R$5 for these glasses and have seen being sold for as little as R$10 but that's very rare. So R$20 is fair and I honestly don't think he would have sold them to a Brazilian at a cheaper price. I constantly ask people what the bottom price for things should be - I ask both the sellers directly as well as my Brazilian friends. By building a good rapport with someone, you can sometimes get them to tell you how much things are really worth. Last night some young guy selling bags was really interested in where we were from and also wanted to learn some English (he only knew a few words!) to increase his sales. We invited him to join us and he stayed for over an hour. Of course I used this opportunity to ask as many questions as possible about the lives of people selling things at the beach and how much things are worth ;) It was very interesting. He said he makes around R$250 - R$500 each day he goes out selling these shitty bags - people buy so much junk. He gifted us one when he left our table :)

I honestly believe that if you can get people to like you and show genuine interest in them, that Brazilians are exceptional people and can actually be quite generous - even the poorest ones. They are definitely not all out to scam you because you're a 'rich gringo'. I once had a homeless man in São Paulo share some bread and milk with me when I was out drunk and talking to people one evening. I speak to everyone, even those who collect trash in the street. I've also hung out in extremely poor 'favela-like' areas and had people buy me drinks and offer me food in bars I've been in.

Other good examples on this particular trip include a taxi driver in Natal discounting half the metered fare for no reason at all. I tried to insist on paying the full amount but he wouldn't take it. What else? Hmmm. A girl we met at Rua Augusta in SP paid for our entire tab (food and drinks) after we socialised for a few hours. A random guy we stayed with in Florianopolis needed to go away to Curitiba and although we'd only known him for two days, he left us his entire apartment for the week. And just last night, we were at a bar in Lapa, Rio and a random guy asked us for a cigarette. His name was Gustavo and he was a taxi driver. We ended up chatting for a couple of hours and had quite a few beers together. Not only did he pay for our saideras (last drinks!), he also gave us a ride back to our accommodation - for free.

I've been coming here for 12 years and absolutely love Brazil. Next year we're moving here permanently. Yes there are some serious dangers and although I take a lot of insane risks, the worst thing that's ever happened to me was having a knife held up to my throat and being asked to take hand over all my belongings, including all of the clothing I was wearing. That was intense but it didn't worry me too much. I've also been aggressively searched twice by the police (once at Leme beach, once in Curitiba) and they really freak me out. Just today when I was out walking with my girlfriend a patrol car slowed down and drove behind us for about 50 m, which was really weird. 

The things that annoy me most about this place are: the difficulty of finding a toilet and constantly having to wait in line to get stuff done. There are lines for everything.

Also, there are state/county/local initiatives and referendums, which are laws that come down to a direct vote, for stuff like targeted taxes (say for education) or whether Sunday liquor sales are legal, or stupid crap like should Alabama legalize interracial marriage (actual ballot question **in the year 2000**).  And then there are the odd local offices, like sherrifs, judges, or the county coroner. I have no idea why those are even elected offices, the voting public generally has no idea what qualifications are necessary, and the campaigns don't seem to even mention or care about who's qualified, adding politics to these things only makes the situation worse.

Learn what you can about who and what is on the ballot before you hit the polling place. If you hate both of the candidates, consider the one that's least horrible. If you honestly feel you cannot make a meaningful distinction between two of your options, read again, think a minute, and if you still feel that way you are allowed to leave that part of the ballot blank. Don't fill in two votes for the same office, that may get your ballot thrown out entirely. ","1414800864"

Try spending/scheduling some time every day orchestrating the conditions of success. This isn't about sheer willpower. 

It's easy to make resolutions when feeling aversion but difficult to keep them when that aversion inevitably subsides and is replaced by indifference or craving. Likewise, craving is transient and cannot be relied upon. There is no substitute for right view and daily effort.

Willpower is fickle, it comes and goes. When you have it, use it to plan and train for when it ebbs. Increase your odds of success with the means available, including: education, intelligent strategies, and sustained practice to rewire and strengthen your mind.

Some suggestions (mileage may vary):

* **Meditate** on a regular basis to strengthen your mind. You're going to be running a mental marathon and training your mental muscles and gathering some insight into the nature of craving and aversion will help. I cannot overemphasize this one, as it will also help to deal with anxiety and other psychopathologies. If you're unfamiliar with this territory, Sam Harris has some nice guided meditation audio [here](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/mindfulness-meditation). Also, Matthieu Ricard has a good one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFQ6Z1LG0xQ).
* Start introspecting your urges as described [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-connection/200901/unleashing-the-power-emotional-connection) and in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Lg9P-VekA).
* Educate yourself on the implications of PMO. Good starts are the videos and articles [here](http://yourbrainonporn.com/) and [this](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/10/09/how-to-quit-porn/) series.
* Consider taking up healthy pastimes and projects to spend time and energy on.
* Cold showers may be a good way to defuse and build up some mental fortitude. See [here](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/).
* Delete any triggering material you have on your electronic devices.
* Install and configure [K9 Web Protection](http://www1.k9webprotection.com/) to block pornographic material (or [Net Nanny](http://www.netnanny.com/) if you don't mind investing a few dollars). For mobile devices, find an equivalent Parental Controls application. Use a [disposable email address](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) and create a complex password which is difficult to memorize, write copies of that password on paper, and store the copies offsite (e.g. work, someone else's place). That way you can reconfigure K9 if you have to, but not so easily that it facilitates relapse.
* Consider doing a full reboot as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4yx4ouxGbQ).
* Don't get shaken by flatlines. Redditors often report relapsing after testing their flatline with PMO; something entirely pointless, as PMO is a false positive anyways. Make the most of a flatline by using it as a precious opportunity to prepare for when it ends and you have to devote energy to resisting the temptation to PMO.
* Consider the many useful tips and tricks [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1tejif/the_big_list_of_tips_tricks/).
* If streaks are a big deal for you, consider tracking your progress in a spreadsheet. With a spreadsheet you can see how you are doing over time across relapses.

As most (if not all) Fapstronauts know, relapsing is often part of the process. Of course, we take as many reasonable measures as we can to avoid relapsing, but when we do relapse it's important to remind ourselves:

* The goal is mental well-being and non-exploitation, not a badge number or streak.
* Failure and course-correction are a part of skill acquisition. Abstaining from PMO is a skill that will take time and effort to acquire, but will also serve you well in many other ways. I think this is largely why people on this forum often report many other benefits coinciding with their efforts.
* Guilt over relapsing may actually be working contrary to your goals, as strong emotions coinciding with PMO may reinforce neural pathways. Work through it as objectively as you can. Meditation can help here also.

At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether your life is overall better when you aren't engaging in PMO, even if you are relapsing. Even with relapses, if you're getting good days and streaks, those are sufficient warrant in and of themselves.","1414800865"

Wish somebody would write something to same end on black resentment towards white people. 

I had exactly the same amount of control over my race as every black person I've ever met. I've never owned a slave. I've never kidnapped a slave. I've never raped a slave. I am half Canadian, many of my American side's ancestors moved here after slavery was abolished, and from what I hear about half the white guys in the US who fought in the civil war did so on behalf of the North... so you'd think that my being pigmentation wouldn't be a huge issue since if I'm related to any slave owners that blood would probably make up less than 1/64th of my total personage, but being a victim has become easy and profitable.

Which would be fine but it's also put other people in jeopardy very unfairly. There is not a lot of white on black violent crime. There is plenty of black on white violent crime. Everybody knows what's up, but to be seen as forward thinking upwardly mobile people we're supposed to pretend that white guys are the threat to black guys... I haven't heard about many white on black murders or rapes in the past few decades. Black on white crime has become a fact of life and that's unacceptable.

When a black man murders a white person it's just sort of an unfortunate fact regarding the state of our inner cities. Just a drop in the bucket. Nobody bats an eye. 

When a white man murders a black person we've got three weeks of candle light vigils, Jessie Jackson/Al Sharpton/Louis Farrakhan &amp; all others who can possibly profit from their statements do, riots break out, you've got various violent *retribution* crimes targeting non-blacks, people shouting no justice no peace until they've reached full on frenzy... and the unspoken threat that at some point this whole crazy mess spreads and gets really out of hand. Conservatives have started jokingly calling it the ""zombie apocalypse"" which would be funny if it wasn't based in the sad fact that a race war may very likely be part of America's future if we don't alter course. 

White people have overwhelming come together to accept their part in historical wrongs and make the world a good place for black people to live in... it would be super stellar if we could take *equality* back and abolish all laws regarding race. That would be a huge first step. Hate crime laws, affirmative action, workplace African American clubs, black fraternities, etc. These are all forms of institutional racism that actually still exist and there are people who knowingly and intentionally perpetuate it. 

The attitude of the black community towards whites today is the most thriving example of racism in the US. Let's see how many forward thinking black peers take the leap to let unity replace hate.

"lawofattraction","t5_2rfq0","""I fear that they will get them before I can"" That is your problem. You look at women as something to be received. We're people too, buddy. It's not a matter of ""getting"" us. It's a matter of just talking to us. Being real, and that also means being your shy self. If a lady has any brain in her head, she'll smell a manipulator from a mile away. Dating a girl isn't about manipulation. Can you get a few dates that way? I'm sure you can, but it won't be real. It won't be worth it. 

It's like you forget that women have free will. Your buddies aren't going to ""get"" them. The women will choose whether or not they want to be with them. 

I'm not impressed when someone thinks they're impressive. A tight physique only turns me on momentarily. Intellectual conversation only interests me for a while. A cliché ""alpha male"" who ""doesn't care"" usually makes me want to run for the hills. For me, it's all about character and how a guy looks at life. I also greatly appreciate shyness.

My point is, don't worry about what women want, because there are a lot of us and each of us want different types of partners. Treat us like people with a variety of experiences, just as you would males. Don't look at us as opportunities for relationships or sex. The funny thing is, once you do that, opportunities for such open up. ","1414800868"

Or maybe some of these people are in fact concerned about what they say they are concerned about and it's not some giant conspiracy to keep the black man down.

It usually takes about 4-6 weeks for it to leave the body and stop having an effect.  And some animals, just like people, can develop habits that cause certain physical responses.  Older male cats will sometimes retain their spraying behavior even after being neutered simply because it is a physical response to a territorial habit they developed while being an un-neutered male.  

Vasectomies are different than a neutering, they just create a physical barrier so the sperm cannot leave the body, the male retains their gonads and never see a drop in their testosterone level.

Leveling Iris to just a thousand is practically impossible at this point, going from 240 to 340 costs almost 500k souls, and after about 60 days of playing, I'm at a total of 6.5 million souls. In no world is sinking that much into Iris feasible.

It's like the two little kids in the sandpit, when one likes the other one, they usually hit them. They are trying to be mean, they just don't know how to show their emotional attraction to them so it all comes out in a big rush.  
(b) your parents actually care a lot about you and want to know what's happening in your life. I'd guess they have no objections but it might be good to ask ""Mum, there's a girl I like and I want to know if you're ok with that"".  
  
3rd grade is a lot different than your current age, so don't read too much into it. I asked similar to my 14yo son when a girl said hi to him and he asked ""why ask me that?"" I told him ""because I'd be really happy when you felt the power of being in love, it's an amazing thing and one of the pleasures of life"" .. this might sound weird but my wife passed away some years ago, and my son and I talk a lot about the good and bad parts of life and how to interpret things that happen in his world. I do my best to not be a helicopter parent and ask him ""how do you feel about that"" when he tells me stuff so I get his opinion first. He has to learn to swim by himself, it doesn't help him if I explain the theory of swimming .. but I can help him to see issues that might arise and how to deal with them before they occur.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Comedy songs in second language/English is actually really common in Norway. It's at least as popular as songs in Norwegian. I personally like kollektivet a lot better than ylvis, here's a couple of their songs:

[Just standing here(with my incredibly long penis)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXmSkPJwUy0) - starts singing at 1 minute

[Don't be slappin' my penis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8LzvLAmk0E)

[The gay rise in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbO-UGs9RpE) - not necessarily one of my favorites, but I guess it's funny for you Americans.

I could go on forever, they have so much good and English stuff.

Edit:
And suddenly I was supposed to go to bed and end up watching kollektivet videos...

Here's one some of you probably heard before (it's usually posted when the comments talk about norwegian comedy): [ÆØÅ (Size matters)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488uJAQgmw)

They're also really really good at parodying ""the yolo generation"" like this: [Crazy hangover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAVyJgP3Usc)

They also do parodies that aren't videos. Here's them parodying [a typical crime show on American tv](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJx4pvefsAo)

This edit is just getting longer and longer. They have song parodies in every genre,  and they're really good as well. Check this [aggressive rap (or what it's called) parody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iti6qS9tjAY) or this [Chris Medina parody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJB8Zdev1Yo&amp;list=RDnqVQ6BuWa8E&amp;index=27)

Nah, I'm just repeatedly pointing out how you're wrong, it isn't out of an inherent defense of the school.

&gt;The news headline reads: ""UW-Madison ranked ahead of CalTech, Stanford, others by UW-Madison student...""

That appears to be a partial headline, yep. Really not a cogent point.

&gt;I don't know what Ron Paul has to do with the fact that this school is not all it's cracked up to be.

I mean, if it's not true, just offer a blanket denial. But I've got a hunch.

&gt;Again, if you love UW, I get that. A lot of people do. It hasn't been as great an experience for me. That's frustrating. I'm airing my grievances here. I think they're valid. You tell me they're not, but offer neither sympathy nor anything substantial to refute it. 

I've refuted your complaints multiple times. You're talking to professors, and doing active research. Nothing else holds up as a valid complaint an adult would make. Classes are large. This is a truism of lower level classes, and is no way a valid criticism of this school, cause it's a commonality in every college that exists in the history of the world. The ways around it are to either lower demand by charging more tuition, or lower supply by restricting the offering of the classes to fewer students.

&gt;So much the better for you if I transfer or drop out, I guess. You can have this ""paradise"" to yourself. I'm saying, not everyone sees it that way.

You were downvoted cause your points didn't really hold up. You're telling yourself that you were downvoted cause your points were unpopular. This is wrong.","1414800884"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Alright homies, it's time for another round of real talk, so I hope you're ready. About a year ago, I made a post about how I was pretty confident most top players in MTG were cheating. I was downvoted harshly then, and I'll probably be downvoted harshly even now. It's not something anyone wants to hear, but hear me out anyway.

I mean, what do you need to do to win your average constructed tournament? You're going to need a top-tier deck for sure, but you're not going to be alone with your $200-$1000+ deck. Pretty much everyone has one of those. There's nothing really mechanically taxing about a game of Magic either. You either understand the rules, and play well, or you don't. So, how do people go on these crazy 3+ tournament winning streaks?

It's got to be cheating. Sorry, but that's how I see it. Just doing some quick Fermi shit, I'd guess that, even with flawless play and a great deck, you'll have well under 50% chance to win any given major tournament. The odds just don't match up.

Variance plays an unfortunately large role in this game. I'm glad the cheating is finally coming to light, if only for my own self-satisfaction.","1414800884"

I wish I quit while I was still in high school (it seems like you are). I'm a senior in college now. If I spent all the time that I wasted on video games learning a useful skill like programming, I would be ridiculously good at it right now.

Don't stress the girlfriend thing. Life can't happen if you are sitting in your room playing video games, so that's the first thing to cut out. Start lifting weights. After a few months you will start to see improvement in yourself, and it will do a ton for your confidence. Girls like both of those things.

 It's not popular that a popular reviewer will notice it in any haste, so how can I speed up the process? 


If I give gifts to reviewers (of my product or otherwise) I can get them to show my product. 


I understand the even subconscious effect to look favorably upon my product, but how do encourage a reviewer to demonstrate my product except through incentive.


 I'm doing the best by giving the incentive first, before a review, so it's not a reward that I'm holding to ransom. 

__________

In the situation where I want someone to advertise my product through a review, from a credible reviewer, how would I do that? 

I pay for ads on TV that aren't very effective. Reviews are more effective (if my product is good) but I can't pay for it? Doesn't sound right.


I'm not paying a reviewer to advertise for me, I'm paying for them to compare it to the market and show what it does and how good it is. The advertising comes as a result.

"CanadianInvestor","t5_347i1","i have the CPP withholding tax on the sidebar but i get 0.432% withholding tax from pepsi due to its 2.88% Dividend yield (has changed since then) so 2.88% * 0.15 withholding tax = 0.432 will be withheld for tax. so in a way, the 0.432 can be compared to a MER as this is how much you're charged. it isnt a flat 0.432, it can be effected quarterly based on what nav is. 

holding this in a TFSA will still be charged 15% of its dividends. holding it outside of a TFSA (non-registered) would still have withholding tax taken. you claim the amount taxed through a T3 form but then Canada and your province (ontario tax rate &gt;37,000 is 5.1% + 15% federal tax) charges you 20.1% because it still needs to be claimed as a capital gain if it is outside the TFSA. you save the provincial tax if you hold US inside your tfsa.

holding a US fund with international holdings in a RRSP means, the international holding charges the fund withholding tax based on  their tax treaties. so if you hold international consumer staples and Nestle gives a annual dividend. so switzerland - US treaty says 5% on income royalty investments or 15% for dividends on holdings. so holding a US fund with international holdings outside of an rrsp gets double taxed but consider the MER of the fund as well, these funds need to pay the withholding tax on these and is sometimes built into the management fee. then we canadians investing into these funds are paying a low MER fee compared to canadian listed funds tracking the same exposure. 

holding an ADR charges 0.07% then charging withholding tax 0.498 Us/canadian tax on the dividend. hidden fees for currency conversion of USD to Francs? i need to research ADR's a bit

Here's my theory: The Iron Isles and possibly some of Westeros was once colonized by the ""Asshai Empire"" but was eventually abandoned. This can be due to A. They didn't see it as a viable colony, B. All the colonists died due to lack of resources/Asshai curse, etc. Or the most dreadful possibility... C.

Aside from spamming Advertisers to pull ads from gawker and not even beeing honst about where they come from (They explicitly said: ""Don't mention GamerGate"").

Aside from still making a fuzz about something that just didn't happen (Zoe Quinn getting a good review for sex)

Aside from pissing on Sites like Polygon who have ""ethical rules"" since 2012?

Aside from willfully missinterpreting articels about ""gamers are dead""?

Aside from ignoring all the real corruption at the high levels of journalism in gaming like IGN or GameTrailers?

That was beautiful.  The very act of going on TV and yelling ""Muslims, Modi called you all dogs, see,see!!!"" when anyone with a modicum of intelligence knew what it was about in context of the puppy remark.

Any muslim person watching that chickenshit will have 2 takeaways

That they will be used as pawns in an election battle

That they will be called dogs on national TV by their very friends.

And Israel's reactions are often not very conducive to feel sympathetic, what with any kind of non-unquestioning support for Israel being met with instantaneous ""Antisemite"" calls.

Both Anti-Americanism as well as Anti-Israel sentiments often stem from a reaction to these dogmatic ways to communicate via the adversarial process. It's black and white, and if you argue for grey, you are black and they are white.

For an economy to grow in Africa they need to sell something, money doesn't magically appear in their pockets that they can buy things. Factories and low skilled jobs follow infrastructure into new areas due to low labour costs. 

I'd also argue that if you look at many of these solar battery packs wcich are being sold as a solution to energy for the poor, that they are simple enough not to create many installation jobs. The jobs created aren't in these communities but in a more industrialised part of the world.","1414800904"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Hey OP! If you ask me, the biggest thing to keep in mind is that repairing ""unforeseen"" problems can really break the bank. The Wall Street Journal did a study that claims 2 out of 5 homes have some sort of major structural defect. If you think about it, that's 40%--almost as bad as flipping a coin. So yes, as others have said, don't use all of your loan money to buy the house. Have an emergency fund ready to help you out. It's the smart thing to do. I would suggest having having anywhere from $10-50k of just WTF money in case something happens.    
  
I also think that whoever suggested buying a duplex or multifamily home is making a VERY GOOD suggestion. A mortgage is a huge amount to pay so finding someone else to pay it for you is good financial advice. If it's to be a pain to manage it, you can always get a property manager to do it for you. If you just buy a single family home, you're paying a lot of money for something that doesn't produce any income.  
  
Assuming that you see your house as an investment, I think that's just a wasted opportunity. From an investment standpoint, it doesn't make any sense. Without income coming in, your only chance of possibly making money on the house is when you go to sell it (I personally don't count loans you can get based on financing once you build up equity because debt has to be paid for). When you go to sell the house, there will be no way for you to predict if the value of your property will go up or go down. No one can predict what the market will do. For example, if you finally get around to selling your home and there's a natural disaster in your area and home values drop, you won't be in a position to get the most out of your property in terms of appreciation. Rental income is a good way to make buying a house a worthwhile investment.  
  
Now onto the important part: the structural integrity and quality of your house is critical. The first important thing is finding a home inspector who's qualified for the job. Here are ten things I would look for (I apologize ahead of time for any bad language; I pulled this straight off of my blog which is pretty salty):  
  
**1. Use Angie’s List and Yelp to weed out bad inspectors.**
No one can guarantee you a good inspection. Even the best inspector can have an off day, and these sites can be wrong from time to time. However, they are really good at letting you know who shouldn’t make the cut from the very beginning. Yelp is free, and I recommend Angie’s List because it’s only about $10/month (Pro Tip: If you give Angie’s List your email, but don’t sign up, they will send you a discount). I highly doubt that you’ll need to pay for more than 1 month if you do things right.
  
**2. Get an ASHI *certified* inspector.**
ASHI (American Society of Home Inspectors) requires its certified members to have at least 250 inspections under their belts. They have the toughest standards out of all the inspection organizations in the country. Just make sure that when you pick an inspector that it is an ASHI *Certified* Inspector. ASHI has a three tiered membership program and the certified members are the most qualified.
  
**3. Use Google to find out if this home inspector has been sued.**
This is huge. The number of home inspectors who have been sued for negligence is astonishing. Even really reputable inspectors have been sued. By using google though, we can stick to those inspectors who have been extremely meticulous and haven’t made any major mistakes. If you don’t want to be stuck with some second-rate jackass, then do this pronto.
  
There’s also a reverse version of this rule. Ask if your inspector has ever been an expert witness in a lawsuit against other inspectors. That’s how you know they’re doing it by the book.
  
**4. NEVER EVER LET YOUR REAL ESTATE PICK YOUR INSPECTOR OR GIVE YOU HOME INSPECTOR OPTIONS. EVER.**
Did you notice the all caps?! There’s a reason I’m talking like Billy Mays here. Your agent has a HUGE conflict of interest and whoever he recommends is going to do a half-assed job. Guaranteed. I don’t care if your agent is Mother Theresa. His/her choices are going to be terrible. Also, if he refers you to a particular home inspector and receives a fee and you have a mortgage, then that’s downright illegal. What’s more likely to happen is your agent presenting you with a whole lot of shitty options. Do yourself a favor and pick the guy yourself. 
  
**5. Tell him to BRING A GODDAMN LADDER!**
I HATE home inspectors who don’t go on the roof. What the hell are you paying for if the guy won’t look at one of the most important parts of your house? Tell him from the very beginning that you expect to see his ass up on the roof and deep in the attic looking for problems. If he doesn’t do the roof, pick someone else. 
  
One dirty tactic I’ve seen is that inspectors will say they do the roof and then show up without the ladder. “Oh dear! I must have left it at home.” If this happens to you, tell him you’ll wait for his fatass to go get one. Or better yet, tell him to go fuck himself. Hell, I like to bring a ladder with me just to fuck with people. Remember: BRING A GODDAMN LADDER.
  
**6. Ask what’s included in the package.**
It’s always good to know what extra things an inspector can offer. Can he do mold and radon testing? Does he have an infrared camera that can spot active leaks? What was his previous job, and what did he study in college? Perhaps you can find someone with a structural engineering background…

Sorry, I just drooled on myself thinking about it. Some folks can offer you all sorts of cool extras if you’re just willing to ask.
  
**7. Don’t hire a home inspector who is also a contractor.**
It’s a conflict of interest. Instead of focusing on the inspection, now you have a contractor who is trying to sell you on a repair–even if it isn’t a necessity. Sure, it’s useful to have contractors come by and take a look (I’ll discuss that later), but there should be one person on your team whose only job is to tell you what’s wrong without any other motive. If they do termite inspections or repairs, just skip them. 
  
**8. References, references, references.**
Get at least 3 references from your guy and call each and everyone of them. Moreover, try to get clients who have owned their properties for at least a year. That will make sure that these clients have seen their homes go through all four seasons of weather. If the references are bad, you know to move on, and if they’re good, ask why.
  
**9. Ask them about their horror stories.**
Every good inspector should have one. Like the time they found a house totally done in aluminum wiring. Or the time they found a roof without any tar paper or ice/water shield beneath the shingles. Or how about the house with the foundation that didn’t even go an inch in the ground. Spooky. If the guys never seen a house he didn’t like, then he’s either blind or not that thorough.
  
**10. Let em know what you think about real estate agents.**
I told my guy upfront what I think about agents, and we hit it off. They don’t recommend him, and he doesn’t stop ripping them a new one. If your inspector isn’t a bit adversarial, you’ve got to ask yourself why and who’s recommending him. If he’s relying on agents to make his bread and butter, then he’s going to take you to pound town.

I think you're so right about my generation thinking that the typical route is the way to go and only thing they understand. Also the more I thought about it, I guess that they must have thought my brother's position is a big deal because he start from bottom and worked his way up (degree probably do help to some degree but it isn't requirement) while I pretty much am at the same position as I was when I first started this job (I have absolutely no intention or desire to move up. I'm happy where I am and want to stay where I am as I get to play with cool toys and design thing all day)

So everybody assume that if my brother walk into my work place and wave his college degree and tell them he's a retail manager, he'd be swoop up on the spot. The reality is, my work place very rarely have any opening and what they are looking for is basically flavor at the time and it is almost a requirement to know somebody to get in.

I was in the same boat last summer.  Built a $1,200 PC (Currently invested almost $2,400 in my PC)  and bought the PS4 on release day as well.  My two cents:

I built my PC mainly to play Titanfall, Custom Zombies and mods.  

PC
Advantages:
* Better graphics
* Triple monitor
* Access to a lot of cool indie and greenlight games
* Mods
* Cheaper games
* Backwards compatible with any PC game ever
Disadvantages:
Not as many friends
* Confined to my desk unless I wanna play on my TV with a controller
* Expensive AF
* Without consistent upgrades, will continue to lose value and performance
* Optimization for PC is sometimes garbage
* Dealing with drivers and tweaking settings (a plus if you're into that stuff)

I usually buy multiplayer multiplats on PS4.  All SP and other stuff on PC.

PS4
Advantages
* Simple plug &amp; play
* Most of my friends are on there
* Easy for netflix and multimedia (Not as good as PS3, but ya know)
* Exclusives
* Couch co-op
* Price
Disadvantages
* Performance not as good as PC
* PSN Stability as of late
* Less Games
* No backwards compatibility","1414800909"

I like the B&amp;W processing on the images. You've done well with that and you've used compositional elements to strengthen the shots, which is good.

The first thing I notice about shot 1 is it's obviously out of focus. This isn't always a bad thing in my opinion (some of Daido Moriyama's out of focus stuff is brilliant), but in this shot the focus in on the clutter and it takes away from the image. The other side of the road is uninteresting compared to the subject. I think you choose the subject well - she is definitely interesting and she matches with the wet weather. There is too much in the frame though. Aim to get closer to remove unnecessary elements and make the subject the focus. (see [Trent Parke's rainy day photo](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=trent+parke+rainy+day&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1448&amp;bih=881&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4CNUVPCeNoLdmAXm-4D4CA&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=ZTBp1RHr_ofiiM%253A%3BhSSvZw11lMqy_M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fmelbournestreetphotography.files.wordpress.com%252F2014%252F07%252Ftp-sr.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fmelbournestreetphotography.com.au%252F2014%252F07%252F19%252Ftrent-parke-3-lessons-from-summer-rain%252F%3B660%3B427))

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","People seem to have learned too much about war and diplomacy from kindergarten.

Diplomacy is not the opposite of war.  It's a meta-level of war.  It's only 'better' because it tends to help resolve issue based on rough approximations of perceived strength and advantage, without resorting to the bloodshed necessary to nail down those values.

Two nations want something.  Nation 1 has it.  Nation 2 wants it.  Nation 2 has a much larger army.

Nation 2 gains nothing from negotiation.  Nation 1 has nothing it can offer, except surrender.  Nation 2 taking what it wants by force has minimal cost, so there is no deal except absolute surrender that is worthwhile to them.  There is no downside to the option of taking the entire thing by force, so there is no reason to enter negotiations where they receive *less* than the entire thing.

This is the current state between Zau-Fu and Kuvira.

There is an army at the gates, and no army inside the gates.  They can not make this hurt.  They can not negotiate anything away.  Kuvira wants Zao-Fu, and there is nothing to offer her, either as incentive or threat, that would change her mind.  Their options are: 1) Fight and lose Zao-Fu, or 2) Give up Zao-Fu.

Diplomacy only works because it is backed up by force, and the perception of the will to use that force.  It doesn't take the place of war.  It is an efficient and preferable extension of war.  And negotiation only works when both sides have something to offer, and something to gain.  The possession of Zao-Fu is zero-sum.  Kuvira is interested in domination of people - not land.  Giving her 80% is meaningless.  Zao-Fu has no ability to force diplomacy, and has no leverage to negotiate.

Enter Korra.

Korra is the only one who can actually negotiate - who can actually field diplomacy, because *she* is an army.

At this stage, diplomacy is counter-threat.  It isn't ""talking it out"".  It's informing the would-be conqueror that the calculus has changed, and it's in their own interest to back off.  Kuvira's *entire army* is here, supposedly.  Opposite Korra, she could now *lose* her entire army, which is an unacceptable cost for Zao-Fu.


The problem here is that Korra doesn't want to fight.  She's Neville Chamberlin, hoping to cut the best deal with Hitler she can, because she doesn't have to confidence or will to fight.

This is why Kuvera isn't negotiating with her.  She's spinning her off, and isn't worried.  Korra has expressed no threat to her army.  While she has power, she has clearly expressed an aversion to using it.  Option: ""Take all of Zao-Fu with minimal cost"" is still on the table, and there is no better, mutually exclusive offer on the table.


**TL:DR**
There is still no room for negotiation.  There is nothing to negotiate.  Kuvira wants Zao-Fu, and there is nothing keeping her from taking it.  It's digital: attack Zao-Fu, or leave Zao-Fu [for now].  

Diplomacy at this time would only be convincing Kuvira that the 'attack' option is now more costly than the 'leave' option.  It the current situation, the damage Korra could wreck on Kuvira's army is the only thing that can make 'attack' more costly.  But Korra has done everything to express that she currently has no intention to getting physically involved.

For people crying for diplomacy - diplomacy right now just means *threatening* convincingly to do what Su suggested Korra *actually* do.  And diplomacy requires that [Kuvera be convinced that] Korra will do exactly that should Kuvera attack.  Without the power to back up the threat, there is no basis for diplomacy.

I hate Hastro as an owner. Preaches loyalty, then drops two players who's stuck with EnVy, and that 'this was the team he'd dreamed of' when they won Gfinity, or whatever other crap he spouted. And all for formal? I mean the dude is good, but if he fears Crimsix and Karma, the dude needs to grow a sack - he should be looking to better them and practice hard as a damn team.

I've never been the biggest fan of Nameless, but he's a great guy I'm sure and feel that he is getting a shit end of the deal. 

What I'm most stunned by, is where the hell is Merk in all this? He's got to be happy he's teaming with two world champions, but after he got fucked over by OpTic, surely he should be saying something to stick up for Kap and Nameless...

 [**Gift economy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift%20economy): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __gift economy__, __gift culture__ or __gift exchange__ is a mode of exchange where [valuables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropological_theories_of_value) are not sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards.  In contrast to a [barter economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter_economy) or a [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy), social norms and custom govern gift exchange, rather than an explicit exchange of goods or services for [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) or some other [commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity). 

&gt;The nature of gift economies forms the subject of a foundational debate in anthropology. Anthropological research into gift economies began with [Bronislaw Malinowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronislaw_Malinowski)'s description of the [Kula ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kula_ring)  in the [Trobriand Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trobriand_Islands) during World War One.  The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinowski's debate with the French anthropologist [Marcel Mauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Mauss) quickly established the complexity of ""gift exchange"" and introduced a series of technical terms such as [reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology\)), [inalienable possessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalienable_possessions), and prestation to distinguish between the different forms of exchange.  

&gt;According to anthropologists [Maurice Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Bloch) and Jonathan Parry, it is the unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange that attracts the most attention. Gift economies are said, by some,  to build communities, and that the market serves as an acid on those relationships. 

&gt;Gift exchange is distinguished from other forms of exchange by a number of principles, such as the form of property rights governing the articles exchanged; whether gifting forms a distinct ""sphere of exchange"" that can be characterized as an ""economic system""; and the character of the social relationship that the gift exchange establishes. Gift ideology in highly commercialized societies differs from the ""prestations"" typical of non-market societies. Gift economies must also be differentiated from several closely related phenomena, such as common property regimes and the exchange of non-commodified labour.

The fact is, 99% of reputable media sources have puked all over GamerGate. That's just the reality. If you weren't so deep in denial, that might prompt some questions on your part about why people whose job it is to report on the truth say such negative things about your beautiful cause.

Other editors compared gators to other fringe viewpoints, and to climate change deniers specifically. When your viewpoint is fringe, it works in your favor to insist that there are two sides, and that you just want open discussion. Fringe viewpoints refuse to acknowledge that they *were* listened to, and they lost. There's no benefit to you admitting that Quinn has already had extensive media coverage, and she has nothing to gain by going into an aggressive interview she may not feel up to.

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","&gt;Perhaps....

it was just a random thought, and with sabo reemerging, i think im not too far out of the water by questioning if hes really dead. it would be cool, if robin could meet him again. thats all im saying.

&gt;Sakazuki as a child...

if the picture is all to go by, then you might be overinterpreting. some people are just ""evil from birth"". oda made clear he shares that view, with his portrayal of the tenryubitou. sakazuki might have had his ideal from the very get go, and he might have tried to enforce it too.

&gt;Well, people generally only follow ideals because they believe they are right.

this is a deeper philosophical point i was trying to make: generally, people attribute priorities to certain things. for example, the difference between an atheist and a faithful chrisitan is how highly they rate the idea that god exists (generally speaking). for the atheist, the idea of logic takes precedence over the idea of god, the christian will view it the other way around. this results in the christian not accepting that inconsitencies that would logically infer that god cannot exist actually mean just that. instead the christian tries to find a way around the apparant impasse, and tries to reunify his faith with reality, and in extreme cases this leads to denial of reality, in order to preserve faith.

and i think akainu rates ""justice"" so highly, that it is beyond reproach. if something contradicts the WG, it is wrong by definition. hes a zealot; a fanatic. his actions certainly support this position.

and i think fujitora was introduced as ""people loving"" very deliberately by oda. i think he wanted to contrast him and akainu. he might be who oda thinks should eventually take akainus place, once luffy kills him.

&gt;But in the end, the operative did do the the right thing. Because he always wanted to do the right thing.

that is up for debate. i think the operative resigned himself to fate, and essentially played the ""good loser"". that doesnt mean he did the right thing. arguably ""the right thing"" would be to take up arms against the alliance. and i think the operative is smart enough to know that.

&gt;So I actually think he's a perfect example of of what I'm saying.

hgnnn~~~...i dont think akainu will break like the operative did. there already were many instances like the one towards the end of serenity. ohara was one, and marineford was another (if not for shanks, coby would be dead). akainu is bloodthirsty. i think that much is clear. the operative wasnt.

&gt;I actually don't think Akainu is necessarily going to to be redeemed but I do think we will be made to feel sympathy for him.

i hope youre wrong. there are plenty of examples of people who are evil and sympathetic. one piece needs a true representative for how evil and vicious the tenryubitou are. and i think akainu is a prime candidate.

Hang in there.  There is hope.  Seriously.

copypasta of my post from an okc ""worst date"" thread:

----

Throwaway.

&gt; how awful everyone is. 

29\.  Severe social anxiety. Lifelong history of mental health issues, been on disability since 18.   (Any idea how much crap you have to have gone through to be accepted as disabled for mental health reasons based on history solely as a minor?)

Had been on a single [non-OKC] date ~8 years ago.

Figured blah, I'm accepting things and moving on with the rest of my life, might as well try to learn to socialize.  I was getting to the age where its kind of now-or-never for trying to find someone to move my life to the ""settle down"" phase with.

For the price of lunch I can try to talk to the opposite sex.

Lunches were *below* the sweaty-palms neckbeard-sporting fedora-wearing level.  I was so stiff a breeze would knock me down.  Missing super obvious social cues.  (""Oh, this is going horribly and you're taking the last half of your meal to-go?  Let me drag this out another ten minutes finish mine."")  Never a second date.

Two months later, not much had changed.  Shitty date?  *All of them.*  How do you do something over and over and never really get better?  I had no idea that was even possible.

-----

Offtopic/Silver Lining:

I was done with my OKC ""experiment"" and it was lunch with literally the last person I was semi-blowing off because I wasn't terribly interested in dating anymore.  It was sushi--and I couldn't use chopsticks, a mistake I had made on my very first date and vowed to never make again.  (Oops.)  Hilarity/embarrassment ensued, about par for the course.

A followup text afterwards indicated they wanted a second date--the next day.  She was super cute, socially outgoing, well educated, successful career, homeowner, etc.  And appreciated me for who I was.

About a month later, I filled her in on my baggage as we were both looking for something long term and it had a significant impact on the present and future.  She was cool with it and supportive.  [Insert the ""is this real"", ""am I being logical"", ""this can't be possible"", ""I have no idea whats going on"", etc.]

I wasn't comfortable *touching on the arm* for two weeks.  The first peck-of-a-kiss was about roughly at that point also.  It was driving her crazy, but there wasn't any sexual anything until about two months in--when I was comfortable with it.

Fast forward.  We've been living together about a year.  We've traveled the country to meet each others' families.  She is my soon-to-be fiancee.

Sukhoi does in fact mostly design fighters, but it has a number of notable exceptions:

* [Su-7 ""Fitter"", a fighter-bomber](http://img.wp.scn.ru/camms/ar/271/pics/6_2_b4.jpg) 

* [Su-17/-20/-22 ""Fitter"", a fighter-bomber developed from the Su-7, notable for being the first Soviet swing-wing aircraft.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Sukhoi_Su-22M4_in_2004.jpg)

* [Su-24 ""Fencer"", a tactical bomber and what the Su-34 is replacing](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Sukhoi_Su-24_inflight_Mishin-2.jpg)

* [Su-25 ""Frogfoot"", famous ground attack aircraft](http://cdn-www.airliners.net/aviation-photos/photos/7/9/7/2326797.jpg)

The Su-34 is best categorized as a strike fighter or fighter-bomber, the same category as the American F-15E for example, because it is still able to operate as a fighter. It's developed from the Su-27 ""Flanker"" line, and is still compatible with I think the full suite of air-to-air missiles.","1414800921"

The latter: http://pd2skills.com/#/v3/mDa:ekHIEFDa:tsOIJEFGbCDa:ghEfCda:febCDa::

With the latter build you still have plenty of skill points that you can spend on silent drilling, some Mastermind skill, perhaps fully loaded, sentries or ECMs. Up to you. You're supposed to use either the Ballistic Vest or the Heavy Ballistic vest. Usually I use an accurate high-damage primary (Gecko or Gewerh) and a shotgun secondary. Alternatively, I use an M1014 with HE rounds and concealment attachments (has to do with playstyle, ask if interested), and an Compact-5 as my secondary.

We've already seen the venom drug, which means Bane is a sure thing. 

With all the mafia story on the show, The Huntress is likely.

Can we even compare the success of the black film community that has somewhat ""thrived"" for forty years to the AsAm film community that has really only been established since the 00s? Black actors weren't handed these roles, and they weren't given their A-list status. They created that work and space for themselves. And you seem to think black representation in media is so great and plentiful when it really isn't. 

&gt; Yes, of course, that would be great, but we shouldn't have to wait until we manage to get them in. 

That's how you become successful in the film industry though... Indie films, small budgets. It's not having about having a self-defeatist attitude. It's about expecting proper representation but also working realistically towards a goal. I'm not disagreeing with you that we shouldn't be treated as 2nd class consumers nor should we take shit from rich white men.

I wouldn't say so. Age doesn't prove a religion. I'm not a wiccan, I'm a reconstructionist (I attempt to practice a certain polytheist religion as close to the original I can which is pretty hard and i'm sure I get some shit wrong :D Ah well) so I'm pretty unbiased here. I don't agree with the wiccan duotheism here personally, but revolution in theology and belief is hardly rare and age doesn't invalidate something. Kant, Aquinas etc, would their theories be any less applicable to a christian if they had been created in a modern time period? Religion, belief etc, all of it changes over time in how it is practiced. Thats just natural, theology evolves just like anything else.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's easy to tell you've been lashed out at before unreasonably, which seems to have left you with a distorted opinion of what an appropriate response to climate change would be.

It's easy to pinpoint several countries that will be hugely affected without needing to predict weather years in advance, which you seem to be demanding. These are low-lying countries like the small islands of Micronesia and Tonga, as well as hugely populous countries like Bangladesh. Desertification, with increased droughts and wildfires, will also majorly affect people as more predictable precipitation trends shift. This is already affecting the US Southwest, Africa, and the Middle East, and resulting food shortages were a major contributing factor to the Arab Spring.

The Earth has many fragile ecosystems whose species assemblages are going to be drastically altered by climate change. We cannot replace essential ecosystem services like precipitation and food production at anything like the scale necessary to sustain production all of us. Of course there might be some increases in arable land in the northern latitudes, and shipping lanes/resources will open up in the Arctic, but you are not being serious to call this anything like a fair trade for the massive loss of property, infrastructure, money, and life that will come along with it. Also, would we really destroy several countries by burning fossil fuels *just to go and extract more fossil fuels* and exacerbate things?

You appear to have some ethical questions here as well, and some of these are, to different degrees, indeed open questions. But the simple principle is that the relatively stable climate we've had the past 10,000 years has allowed enviroments and species to equilibria the in a way that has been very favorable for us humans. All of human agriculture, for instance, has developed since the last Ice Age. A better question might be to ask just how far outside those bounds it will still support us. There is no objective reason to suppose we cannot destroy our only lifelines eventually.

The climate is indeed going to change, with and without us causing it, over long enough timescales. It will be a monumental and tumultuous ride. I think it would be incredibly irresponsible here not to follow the lead of the vast majority of people who wake up in the morning and professionally study the climate all day. ","1414800947"

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","Did you actually buy the early access and expect this game to not follow the same pattern of development as every other high profile game ever?  All major games face delays and issues.

The only difference is that BI let people buy access to the game early, whereas other major games have the weight of gigantic publishers behind them.  Those major games also take four, five or more years to develop.  This one has been in development for two.  Yeah, it's working with an existing engine.  *So do plenty of other games which take years to develop.*

The real problem with early access is the fact that most of the gaming community is full of pigheaded idiots who ignore warning after warning and know *nothing* of the software development process yet still buy these games.

Well, there goes that, haha! Honestly though, thanks a lot for your detailed response. However, I guess I'm shit out of luck. I'm a bit younger than the age group you've listen, and I wouldn't consider myself middle class (by UK standards). 

If I do ever get insurance it would probably be 3rd party, the cheapest one. In fact if it was up to me, I wouldn't really insure my car since it's too old and if it's going, it's going. Guess I'll first focus on graduating and landing a job, then depending on the wage I'll figure something out.

Try spending/scheduling some time every day orchestrating the conditions of success. This isn't about sheer willpower. 

It's easy to make resolutions when feeling aversion but difficult to keep them when that aversion inevitably subsides and is replaced by indifference or craving. Likewise, craving is transient and cannot be relied upon. There is no substitute for right view and daily effort.

Willpower is fickle, it comes and goes. When you have it, use it to plan and train for when it ebbs. Increase your odds of success with the means available, including: education, intelligent strategies, and sustained practice to rewire and strengthen your mind.

Some suggestions (mileage may vary):

* **Meditate** on a regular basis to strengthen your mind. You're going to be running a mental marathon and training your mental muscles and gathering some insight into the nature of craving and aversion will help. I cannot overemphasize this one, as it will also help to deal with anxiety and other psychopathologies. If you're unfamiliar with this territory, Sam Harris has some nice guided meditation audio [here](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/mindfulness-meditation). Also, Matthieu Ricard has a good one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFQ6Z1LG0xQ).
* Start introspecting your urges as described [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-connection/200901/unleashing-the-power-emotional-connection) and in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Lg9P-VekA).
* Educate yourself on the implications of PMO. Good starts are the videos and articles [here](http://yourbrainonporn.com/) and [this](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/10/09/how-to-quit-porn/) series.
* Consider taking up healthy pastimes and projects to spend time and energy on.
* Cold showers may be a good way to defuse and build up some mental fortitude. See [here](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/).
* Delete any triggering material you have on your electronic devices.
* Install and configure [K9 Web Protection](http://www1.k9webprotection.com/) to block pornographic material (or [Net Nanny](http://www.netnanny.com/) if you don't mind investing a few dollars). For mobile devices, find an equivalent Parental Controls application. Use a [disposable email address](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) and create a complex password which is difficult to memorize, write copies of that password on paper, and store the copies offsite (e.g. work, someone else's place). That way you can reconfigure K9 if you have to, but not so easily that it facilitates relapse.
* Consider doing a full reboot as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4yx4ouxGbQ).
* Don't get shaken by flatlines. Redditors often report relapsing after testing their flatline with PMO; something entirely pointless, as PMO is a false positive anyways. Make the most of a flatline by using it as a precious opportunity to prepare for when it ends and you have to devote energy to resisting the temptation to PMO.
* Consider the many useful tips and tricks [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1tejif/the_big_list_of_tips_tricks/).
* If streaks are a big deal for you, consider tracking your progress in a spreadsheet. With a spreadsheet you can see how you are doing over time across relapses.

As most (if not all) Fapstronauts know, relapsing is often part of the process. Of course, we take as many reasonable measures as we can to avoid relapsing, but when we do relapse it's important to remind ourselves:

* The goal is mental well-being and non-exploitation, not a badge number or streak.
* Failure and course-correction are a part of skill acquisition. Abstaining from PMO is a skill that will take time and effort to acquire, but will also serve you well in many other ways. I think this is largely why people on this forum often report many other benefits coinciding with their efforts.
* Guilt over relapsing may actually be working contrary to your goals, as strong emotions coinciding with PMO may reinforce neural pathways. Work through it as objectively as you can. Meditation can help here also.

At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether your life is overall better when you aren't engaging in PMO, even if you are relapsing. Even with relapses, if you're getting good days and streaks, those are sufficient warrant in and of themselves.","1414800958"

I don't think that the *severity* of the experiences can be directly compared between the two videos. For example, the woman-centred video was generated from more than 3 times the amount of raw footage than the man-centred video.

This video is not very interesting from an oppression olympics ""who-has-it-worse"" point of view. But it is interesting in light of Hollaback's [claims](http://www.ihollaback.org/blog/2014/10/27/new-street-harassment-psa/) that this behaviour is ""gender-based violence"" used as a means to keep subordinated groups in their place.

&gt; Please... Please tell me where I made it out to be simple. I'd love for you to show me where I said that. Let's hear it.

The way you use certain phrases such as 
&gt;Mexican-Americans have special cause to be more socially active against racism than Mexicans do

 and 

&gt;I didn't mean to say Mexicans don't face racism at all, but they haven't been systematically marginalized by more dominant social/racial groups in their country the way Mexican-Americans have been by whites. 

in such a matter of fact way makes it sound a little bit dismissive of the complexity of the racism that exists in Mexico. To say that certain groups haven't been systematically marginalized in Mexico the way other groups have been in the US really sounds to me like an oversimplification of aspects of racism that can be subtle, normalized, taboo, and deeply ingrained in Mexican culture, aspects which are often influenced by history, politics, and tradition that don't always carry over to Mexicans born in the US and are therefore not completely interchangeable or comparable. 

&gt;I'm not making it out to be a game of who has it tougher. My sole point is that Mexican-Americans are much more marginalized in the United States than Mexicans of most groups (or any group, even indigenous groups I'd dare to say) in Mexico.

This is an example of what I see as an oversimplification of the issue by making inapt comparisons that disregard cultural contexts.

&gt; And thanks for the links but I don't need the information. I'm more than adequately educated on this topic. I grew up in Texas, studied in Mexico, majored in Spanish in school, did my honors thesis on Mexico-Spain geopolitical relations, worked on a masters' program in Spanish literature before entering law school, and I worked for a Mexican immigration law firm in law school. I'm very well aware of the cultural history of and acquainted with the people of Mexico and don't really need any ""education"" on the topic.

I don't know who you are or what your background is, so I only commented on the content of your posts. The articles I posted were there to support my points rather than to educate you. ","1414800961"

With a lot of this stuff, there's no credible data but they claim there is, because who doesn't like taxing shit?

&gt; I assume then that you think recreational drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes should be untaxed, then?

I'm unsure. With cigarettes, the negative health effects are well demonstrated. 

&gt; Not sure how you can claim they don't work, though. Sure it doesn't eliminate the behavior. It is never meant to. 

It's definitely meant to. Cigarette and alcohol taxation in a number of countries is quite specifically aimed to eliminate smoking, not solely to offset the costs of their public health effects.

&gt; I'm also ok with spending an extra 10-20% on alcohol

If only it were an extra 20%, I wouldn't be against it. But it can get a lot higher than that. In Finland, the excise on liquor is around $60 per liter of pure alcohol, so $24 for a liter of whiskey/rum/vodka. For beer, it's $3 per six pack.","1414800966"

And how often have you bought a non-advance ticket that was of a standard type (i.e not a TOC special offer) and was TOC specific? Every anytime, off peak and super off peak I've ever bought has certainly had no restriction on TOC. No different to the BR days.

The key point that I was trying to make is that BR did not have one ticket for a given journey - they had time based ticketing too, just as today's train companies have, and if BR was around today with self-service ticket machines it may well have had the same issues as today's systems (including the one that the currently nationalised East Coast uses)

I'm impressed how many people seem unable to grasp my point - perhaps their blind and misguided desire to nationalise regardless of the actual benefits/downsides is getting in the way?

&gt; It was an essential piece of national infrastructure, rather than a system designed to maximise what could be extracted from the customer to the point that driving or even flying are more cost-effective.

If you are going to use that argument, then Slain backstabbed Inaho, which isn't correct, but is more valid than the reverse for that situation).

"EnoughLibertarianSpam","t5_2tzlb","&gt; Note that what is of significance isn't that he doesn't transact or doesn't make a profit (in the general sense we colloquially use the term), the important part is that he doesn't allow others to use him, that he only sells his services or his property, but not his own person in whole or in part

This is exactly the stance I took; however, I seem to be using a different definition of ""his own person"" - where my definition includes a person's limited time. As you said, ""in fact the latter [being alive] is a precondition of the former [liberty] what with existence preceding essence and all that jazz.""

A person has a finite amount of time to be alive, and neurons take a non-zero amount of time to fire, thus a human being has a limited capacity for determining and ""discretionally exercising"" their will. Thus, time is freedom, so freedom is bounded. More rigorously: lifespan places an upper bound on possible cumulative freedom. The selling of a person's services/time would thus constitute an intentional decreasing of the upper bound of the cumulative freedom which that person may ever experience in their lifetime.  This would seem to violate the rule ""only sell your services or property, but not your own person in whole or in part.""

Such an act would constitute the selling of a portion of one's life - something which you took a very strong stance against in your first comment. What is different now?

As an aside: I know Kant had no problem with profit. I understood that Kant's argument was never predicated on the identity or utility of the resources involved in the compensation portion of the transaction. And I never said that transactions violate freedom whenever compensation is involved - only that they violate freedom when obligation is involved. In this regard, I think you misunderstood a part of the argument I was making, since you put so much time into dispelling those notions which I had never espoused.

Now on to the praise:

&gt;You also seem to be referring to the real existence of scarcity and identifying this as a violation of freedom.

Yes. Absolutely. This was indeed the conclusion I was drawing. And this:

&gt;What it does imply is a contextual, de facto violation of someone's substantive right to self-determinate, so we have here a contextual violation of autonomy that -insofar as the context is natural- can not be traced back to any moral agent.

Was exactly the kind of reply I needed to help me formulate my stance on the matter. Thank you for putting it into words.

And lastly:

&gt;&gt;From this, we can derive that the defaulting party has a right to those resources

&gt;This doesn't follow, as I showed.

I read your response multiple times and never could find where you showed this. I also completely disagree that ""it is an expressed will"" to be obligated to perform tasks before one is allowed to get what one wants. That seems antithetical to me. Entering into such an agreement would curtail one's freedom, limiting one's ability to act on one's will. In this sense, ""past me"" should never be able to force obligations on ""future me."" Thus, in order to ensure that one entity is not imposing itself on another, you must take as an axiom that human beings are constant and unchanging (completely false) - that ""past me"" and ""future me"" are not separable - and that ""future me"" is entirely culpable for the decisions of ""past me.""

As a last thought before I finish this comment: I am so excited that you were able to respond to me, and that your response was so thorough and insightful. Thanks.","1414800973"

They also tested with other monsters but couldn't control them, such as aliens, which was unrelated because they didn't know how to manage it.

The organization grew bigger but couldn't handle the new wave of monsters they were trying to control, such as witches.

RNs get months of orientation as new graduates.

So long as we treat assaulted women like damaged goods this issue will remain.

All of this stems from an inherent bias against accusers, and therefore victims.

* Programmers with no mathematical background

* Complete lack of version control/documentation

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I learned to masturbate mostly the same way, I would put a balled up blanked under myself usually. When computer porn became a normal part of my 'bating routine, I started rubbing myself through my underwear. I sit in a chair, pull off my pants but leave my underwear on, and I just rub my dick with my hand, I'm sure it looks a lot like a girl masturbating. 

I never thought it caused me any sexual issues, but it's always been mostly impossible for a girl to make me cum from hj/bj, and i usually have to be ""on top"" in order to climax. I am now at a spot in my life where I'm having enough sex with a very open-minded partner that I have been comfortable experimenting. 

First, I abstained from masturbation for 2 weeks, then I started again, but using the traditional grab and jerk method (with lube). I pay very close attention to how hard I'm squeezing, keeping a very light grip. This method now works fine for me, I can cum almost as quickly as the methods I had used for the previous 15 years or so. 

Last week I had my first orgasm from receiving oral. It was fucking awesome. 

So my advice to you would be to stop prone mastubating, and start masturbating in a way that mimics how you want to achieve climax with your partner, simple right? 

Also, don't overthink this, you might not have anything to worry about at all. But if you do have issues, it's totally fixable.  ","1414800989"

* Dikkenek - sister bar to The Beers in Croix Rousse. Same menu, different atmosphere. 

* Les Berthom - a chain bar with two locations in Lyon (Vieux Lyon and Presqu'île) good selection/price and locations. 

* Les Fleurs du Malt - in Vieux Lyon, EXCELLENT selection and location, but pricy. 

* La Palais de la Bière - best beer selection in Lyon. Also the most arrogant and dickheadish owner. I don't go there because it's super expensive and I don't like the owner. 

* All the English pubs in Vieux Lyon and near Hotel de Ville. They are English speaking and have standard English options. Not bad for a simple night of watching football or just wanting to have an easy drink with friends. ","1414800990"

    while read -r line; do ...; done &lt; file

or

    cat file|while read -r line; do ...; done

instead of

    for line in $(cat origfile.csv); do ...; done

because per default the IFS environment variable tells bash to split words at white space, so $line will also contain parts of lines with white space instead of whole lines.

Furthermore you wrote the following, but I think it won't do what you intended it to do, because you used "" cat $line "" instead of "" echo ""$line"" "":

    for line in $(cat origfile.csv); do cat $line | gawk -F , '{print $2"",""$3"",""$4"",""$1""_text_to_add""}' &gt;&gt; newfile.csv; done

This still sounds like you think of ""I"" and ""my body"" as two distinct things that just happen by chance to be connected (such that theoretically your ""I"" could be connected to a different body). 

The materialist perspective here is that they're exactly the same entity; that ""you"" couldn't exist anywhere/when other than ""your body"" because you *are* your body. Your mind and personality is a result of the chemistry happening in your brain and the input from the sense organs of your body... not just coincidentally but necessarily. Under that view, asking why your thoughts are in *your* head specifically makes about as much sense as asking why your digestion isn't happening in someone else's stomach.

1) To prevent disputes from happening! Just like how any seller can run off with your money without delivering, the buyer can also pay and then dispute it right afterwards, which is a risk for the *seller* too.

2) To prevent large fees. Naturally, the seller would not want to get hit with fees. Paypal always takes some money from the payment that is to be received. We avoid these fees by using the Friends &amp; Family option. 

Don't go around spreading false information. You are being highly disrespectful. Only go around spreading this information IF you have some sort of sufficient evidence of past scams or things that people should ACTUALLY be wary about.

Think that the 4th dimension could represent time, you travel through that it to get to a different instance of our 3 dimensional space time quicker than manually travelling through relativistic time (I think, I'm bad at explaining this.) Anyways, the 5th dimension could theoretically represent possibilities- a good way to perceive this is in one instance of our 3 dimensional existence from a 5 dimensional point of view would be you living your life as you are now, another would be you being a crack head, and another an astronaut. In one you don't even exist, and in another everything is exactly the same, except at one undefined point in the universe- one particle is relativistically in a different position then ""the same"" particle in our universe. It's a pretty infinite place, and it gets even more infinity, but either way, we are not a place they would go.

UNLESS. Understanding that brings you to being a consciousness fully aware of what it is. Which poses the question- what is it that you would do when you have the mental power of infinity? When you can dream up anything ever, when you're aware precisely how your reality works and can manipulate it in any which way you desire?

Well, what I would like to think- is it would do exactly what it is that ""we"" are doing right now. We're going on the adventure of the universe, finding all the answers again, hidden in the infinitely intricate complexion of space- We're living :)","1414801004"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","I thought that the only way to have kids (at least in my generation) was to get pregnant ""unexpectedly"" either via failed birth control or sabotaging birth control methods. I didn't know one planned pregnancy or marriage proposal that wasn't brought on by an accidental pregnancy. All I saw were an endless stream of baby daddies and possible future baby daddies that weren't constantly in the lives of their own children. The mothers stayed with their parents and worked all day, then went out and partied during the night. The grandparents essentially raised their own grandchildren. 

So, as a young kid I figured that chances are, I would never have kids. I literally never saw a functional relationship that wasn't one-sided or a shotgun wedding. I never saw two people work together, fall in love and make plans for the future together as equals.

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","I think the important things to take out of the finale are the plot points and how they work together. Like how Cinder considered the plan a success despite things not going according to plan, Roman wasn't bothered at all by the fact that he was captured, Adam is helping Cinder's crew, Ironwood's in charge of safety for the tournament, mystery woman is probably yang's mom and plot points from previous episodes such as the Communications tower being hacked, the existence of Grimm that would actually pose a threat to Vale (the Goliaths), and Penny (no explanation required).

All these plot points and more are connected and we've got 2/3rds of a year to speculate on how.","1414801010"
"Animesuggest","t5_2ssl0","**[Is this a Zombie?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8841/Kore_wa_Zombie_Desu_ka)**

* *Trailer:* [Dubbed version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_59oXSd6qas)

* *What it's about:* Aikawa Ayumu was your everyday garden-variety high school student until he made the mistake of trying to save someone from a serial killer. Now he's a zombie, trying to figure out who killed him. But that's only the start of his troubles, as he encounters a series of increasingly bizarre characters and ends up gaining the ability to transform into a ""Magical Garment Girl"", complete with cute girly outfit, disturbingly fetishised transformation sequence and magical chainsaw.

* *Why watch it:* It's tropey, silly, and its premise is out and out ridiculous, but it's utterly unashamed about it and the result is surprisingly charming. This is not a complex story, but it's funny and over the top from start to finish

* *Caveats:* See the ""why watch it"" segment above - this kind of show doesn't appeal to everyone, but if you like the *sound* of it, you'll probably enjoy it.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","If you'd read several of the most recent threads you'd see that a common complaint is that people do bug report, but they aren't listened to and builds go though with bugs that are reported by the community.

Simply saying ""rather that just sit around and complain"" is irrelevant in this scenario. And similarly, I would say that not making posts and/or making a post staying stop complaining is also circle jerking for the white knights that won't hear anything wrong said about the game, except when people complain at least things happen. If you don't say shit then the devs will think everything is fine and dandy.

Complaining shows that you care, the more people complain, the more likely there'll be change. If you just sit and think ""well, it will be fixed when it will be fixed, no point in complaining"", this will achieve nothing, or at least less than complaining. The side that doesn't 'complain' brings regurgitated statements, at least those complaining might actually get the fucking ball rolling.","1414801017"

I still think the moral judgements of rape derive from the value of what is being taken by force (sex from a person).

This, I think, is a huge reason no one gives a shit about male rape. Humans have developed in such a way that male sex is worthless compared to a woman, and men are expected to be strong, since that is what our environment (and consequently women) select for.

This stuff isn't going to change any time soon, and one might even have some reservations as to WHETHER they should change.

Regardless of the specifics of their interaction or relationship, I feel that a journalist should be open about their involvement together and disclose it or not write it at all. 

I spoke to a reporter from the Daily Dot about this yesterday.

Nobody here can deny the greatness of Galois, but it's kind of hard to sell him to the general public in a relatable way.

The story of Turing is much easier to comprehend by people who knows no math: ""He cracked the Nazi German codes, allowed us to listen in to their strategies, invented (well, yeah, sorta) the computer which I use at work every day, and then he got persecuted for being gay and committed suicide."" Pretty dramatic stuff. The only way to describe Galois in a way that non-mathematicians can understand is basically ""he figured out when you can and when you can't solve equations, you know, the stuff that bored you to tears in high school. Then he would have joined the big rebellion in Les Misérables and died gloriously except, actually, he died on the eve of the rebellion in an unrelated duel.""","1414801025"

Actually yes. You would get a file system error in that case.

&gt; As for the onboard devices part, I reckon the Ara people are aiming at condensing the whole system to a single board (and this is where the personalised chip magic comes in) that comunicates with all the peripherals through a well known and robust bus standard. Like usb, mmc....whatever deals with everything the app developer doesn't have to, or even the kernel developer, for that matter.

Right. And since it has connectors, those connectors can part under stress.

"OpiatesRecovery","t5_2tkk8","The issues of reckless use and shady doctors and clinics are just as pervasive with subs as any other prescription opioid or opiate, no doubt. And you're right that it can become another drug of choice or a worse addiction. 

To be honest I can't even rightly say it was ""Subs"" that did it for me. It was accepting a regimented program and monitored dosage at a good clinic with a (finally) desperate approach. 


If the clinic had given me an exact amount of oxycontin or whatever each day the effects probably would have been the same. (Though the subs have an added benefit for me of only being associated with ""recovery."" If I'd been prescribed any other opiate I'd have that association of using.) It's not a miracle drug and sadly that lie is told far too often.

I'm sorry you've had bad luck with shitty clinics and doctors. There are a lot of them out there. And in the world of prescription opiates the careless or money-hungry ones far outnumber the responsible ones. Doesn't matter if we're taking about Suboxone, Vicodin or Fentanyl. ","1414801027"

But being at the top and seeing how Malawi witnesses were treated vs Mexicans just because of the assets WTS was protecting should have made Ray do something.  We're talking about rapes, murders and atrocities allowed by Watchtower!  Seeing all he had from the top hasn't made him leave nor do anything about it until he got the boot.  

As for 1914, where did you hear that he openly do anything against 1914 or 607?  They were all there and read Jonsson's thesis on 607BC and they didn't do shit!  Ray was part of them and he deserves the scolding just as much as every GB at the time.  His views or opinions were shared with few he trusted until he got ratted out if I remember correctly but what about the rest of the millions of followers?  

There is a difference between a follower and the one doing the leading, the leader is and will be criticised much more harshly than a simple foot soldier.  

If we are to excuse his inaction as a leader why do we criticize present GB members?  We can argue that present GB members are in the same situation as Ray and are victims and can't speak up and yet I don't see anyone here apologizing for the wts scum?  

As I said, his post-wt book and actions may redeem his inaction while a wts leader and there is no doubt that Ray was a very kind man but there are many JW that are kind and warm hearted elders but if they know that they are hurting their flock and teaching lies, that kindness can be thrown out the window.

That's why we have a House of Commons that is democratically elected and that holds the vast, vast, vast majority of political power in the UK.  

The Lords allows some people who might not have the 'charisma' or the 'persuasion' skills of a career politician to still have some influence and power, if they were successful in their field.

Except insofar as it might contribute to a ""climate"" of opposition to private spaceflight, it fortunately (from a scientific viewpoint) shouldn't matter if every Virgin Galactic vehicle blows up tomorrow. The Virgin space-tourism stuff is to actual space exploration as recreational reef snorkeling is to bathyscaphe research.

Virgin Galactic propose to eventually have something that can make it to orbital velocity - they call it ""LauncherOne"", a small-payload rocket launched from their White Knight plane; it's genuinely interesting but doesn't yet exist - but they haven't done anything like that yet. They just squirt up above the arbitrary 100km altitude line where we currently say ""space"" begins (in Kerbal Space Program the space music starts playing at 70km!), then fall back down again.

For comparison, the International Space Station, which is really in an impractically *low* orbit, is about 420km above sea level. The important part, though, is that the ISS is moving at orbital velocity ""sideways"", so it doesn't just fall back down. SpaceShipTwo's spec-sheet maximum speed is an impressive 4000 kilometres per hour, but that's only 1.1 kilometres per second. The ISS is moving at **7.66** kilometres per second. Getting your space-thingy up to that speed is the real problem for orbital launches. (And if you want to leave the earth behind completely, your launcher-and-space-vehicle system needs a few more km/s of delta-V on top of that.)

Since the sensible thing for human space exploration at the moment is to keep the heavy squishy humans on the ground and shoot a *lot* more little expendable robot probes all over the darn place, Virgin Galactic could be a real part of the solution. Not with any of these passenger-carrying semi-spaceplanes, though.","1414801038"

"books","t5_2qh4i","Okay, I see I need to lay a bit of groundwork to explain.

There's this separate thing called a ""deterministic system"". Let's say you have a calculator on your computer, and you type 1 + 1 in the calculator. There's nothing random or ""free will"" going to happen.  Before you press enter, you understand all the factors involved (if you know electrical engineering and programming, that is), and you can determine ahead of time the outcome.

Which of course is 2.

That's where the phrase ""deterministic"" comes from, it's ""once all factors are known, the outcome can be determined"".

Now, in order for us to *prove* determinism we would have to be nearly omniscient. We would have to know every possible contributing factor to a decision like skipping homework -- the role of every neuron, neurotransmitter chemical, dna predisposition, what the child was taught, his response to teaching etc. Someone like me thinks that, if we did know all those things, we'd be able to perfectly predict his behavior. After all, the dopamine and electricity running through our brains is subject to the laws of physics.

BUT! We don't know all those things, so we cannot rule out some other factor -- free will being one of them. 

So why do I think determinism is more likely than free will? Because everything I've ever seen in life happens because of a cause. The only two things that I cannot explain are the mind, and the origins of the universe.  And as we start understanding how the mind works, it seems less magical, and more rational (though no less amazing) to me. It seems like just one more thing we'll understand the causes for.

Determinism is a logical extension of what I have already seen (which is ""cause and effect"").

On the other hand, to me, I've never seen anything act without prior influence, unless it's just random. And if it's random, it's not a will. And so I cannot even tell what ""free"" could mean in ""free will"". Free from what?

That's why determinism makes sense to me.","1414801038"

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","I'm of the opinion that any car manufacturer could make a decent electric car at will, if they wanted to.  The problem is for a normal car company, you have opportunity costs.  Every second spent by an engineer, marketer, builder, etc.,. on that electric car project, is a second not spent on making an F150 or a BMW 3 Series, or whatever it makes more sense from an entrenched business perspective to be doing.

Also, I'm not sure what a normal manufacturer's margin is per car, but I would suspect it's quite a bit higher than Tesla's 25-28%.  I'm assuming it's more in the 40% range.  Maybe even higher.  So again, that's another reason it's not happening.

The whole point of Tesla is that they don't have all these problems, and they just want to make cool electric cars.

That said, BMW's i8 HALO CAR is less desirable to me than my 6 year old Tesla Roadster -- so maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe other car manufacturers actually can't just make better cheap electric cars.  ","1414801038"

If it is D1/D0 then I see it as a pure cash grab. If it is a year or two old and players are declining, then I see it as a last chance cash grab.

Give me a full game, then add to it. [Look at the comments on this video](https://youtu.be/dQ7yVvxk8Q4).

To meet other people, try finding a hobby of some sort and look for a group of people that enjoy it. You can find clubs for books, sports, arts and crafts, and more. Try searching online or at a community center for some options. 

Another idea involves going to a church - even if you are not very religious, people tend to be very welcoming and friendly there. Obviously it will vary by community, but every church I've been dragged into (I'm not very religious myself, haha) has been packed with smiling people that genuinely care about others.

The inspector could be their friend who is charging them nothing until he gets a kickback from whatever they're trying to pull on you. S/he will find lots of expensive things wrong with the house to try and get the price down.


The buyer could have another party ready to buy the property from them for $15k the day after, and then they disappear into the ether. 


They could buy your property and try to declare bankruptcy the next day.


They could jerk you around in the days prior to the closing to get even more favorable terms for themselves.


There are so many ways this could go wrong.


If you're open to working with this buyer, tell them that they can submit an offer for $20,000 in 60 days when they are presumably able to bring all the funds to closing... if the house is still on the market. You can also tell them that they are welcome to have an inspection at their own cost but the house is being sold as-is and you will not entertain any discount requests for items found on the inspection. Most importantly, under no circumstances should you accept any offer where you get some of the money now and some of it later. They pay you the full price and you give them the keys.

So, they aren't there to compete with farms in any way and are for a different time/stage and even type/strategy of a game. They're intended to be situational and give you a culture building on the other side of the tech web, so you don't have to go terrasphere. When you go the Vertical Farming-way and need culture, and may have few but big cities, they become an interesting option. 

The 10hp bonus synergies with a strategy which focusses on fewer cities as well, since you can't unit spam as much and would be more on the defensive side anyway. They're definitely not meant for a wide-spread expansionist game but have their place when it comes to the Promised Land victory f.e.

Hunters have a vested interest in maintaining the population of all game animals- because again, they want to be able to continue to hunt them.

Making wolves a game animal adds value to wolves, and makes hunters have a similar vested interest in perpetuating the population. 

Elk in michigan have a similar population level, and they have done just fine with hunting, because the DNR carefully monitors the levels and makes changes as fit.  

Additionally, they do have natural predators.  They're called wolves, coyotes, and humans.  

&gt;It is the fault of people for disrupting the ecosystem for the state it is in today.

Most likely.  So why then are you opposing the DNR taking charge to make sure that the population of all michigan species are kept in balance?

Because that's all this proposal does- let the DNR manage the population of wolves.  There is no obligation for a hunt.  If the DNR (who I am fairly certain are a TAD more knowledgeable about these issues than you are) decides that a very, very limited hunt is beneficial to the population, then how can you logically oppose it?","1414801048"

Section 4. [**Feeding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_bat#Feeding) of article  [**Vampire bat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire%20bat): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;Vampire bats hunt only when it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and fish-eating bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses [thermoception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_vampire_bats) to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.

""You're fat, aren't you embarrassed - &lt;mothers name&gt;, to her child""

Whenever you are with her and she is talking to someone else, flat out ask them ""Do you think its appropriate for a mother to say this to her kid..&lt;quote&gt;"" Even if its completely off topic. Sure it will be embarrassing for you, but hopefully she will stop after a few times. You could even explain it to them ""My mother keeps insulting me and I'm trying to get her to stop, what is your opinion on this.

Hell, more and more young voters consider themselves Republican and will go down the same road even. Ronald Reagan is still a publically admired figure. And on Reddit this is not even consensus anymore - it used to be, until Reddit grew and attracted said main stream of our generation.

So far our generation hasn't shown its superiority on these issues at all. At least there used to be real resistance in the 70s, and now we have total compliance outside Occupy, which Reddit also started to dismiss.

And the privatisation of space flight under a capitalist model just feeds into the same issues. Privatised Space Flight - so that we, the taxpayers, pay private corporations to explore space. Sounds awesome from the point that the race for profit will increase innovation. But at the same time it means to feed into an economically exploitative system (that of wage labour - the labourers create surplus value for their employers), which means that ultimately all the profits from the program end in the hands of once again a few oligarchs. It's very comparable to the automatisation of production: It always sounded like a utopia coming true, but in reality that production and all of its profits belong to few and the masses cannot even afford the produced products anymore.","1414801055"

Normally bonds have a maturity date.  For example, a 10 year bond has a maturity date ten years from the day it was issued.  That means that one the final day of year 10 the full amount of money borrowed is repaid.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","I think GamerGate was actually born out of a lot of legitimate concerns.

You mentioned payola. The Kane and Lynch controversy and Doritosgate already demonstrated this type of corruption in the industry. I mean the Dorito Pope was a meme long before gamergate ever took off.

Then you have the fact that gaming has become much more widespread and diverse than it was in the past. So-called ""core gamers"" are no longer the only audience. Additionally, you have the meteoric rise of Youtubers and twitch streams as a means of learning about games. Online gaming journalism sites have been falling out of favor with core gamers for a long time. Consequently they have begun catering to a different demographic. 

This has sort of led to a disconnect between ""gamers"" and gaming journalism. It's led to journalists demonizing their former readers over various controversies. This has resulted in things like the Mass Effect 3 ending controversy and the DmC: Devil May Cry Dante controversy. Certain publications started pushing a ""Gamers are entitled"" narrative that has been received well by some communities and very poorly in others. This attitude culminated, more or less, into the slew of ""Gamers are Dead"" articles that were written.

Also the explosion of the indie gaming industry has contributed to the feelings behind gamergate.You have these great successful games like Super Meat Boy, Minecraft, Bastion, The Binding of Isaac, and Cave Story. Suddenly there is this great booming indie gaming industry with lots of optimism and opportunity. Crowdfunding, early access, and digital distribution have made it easier than ever to get an indie game out there. Unfortunately not every game or every idea can be a success. Certain games that get funded never really get made, or at least don't live up to expectations. People get disgruntled or feel betrayed. Also a new breed of developer is born out of this, the Phil Fish types, who may be brilliant but don't always play nicely with their audience.

There is also the complicated issue of game design, theory, and game criticism and how it fits into art and academia, or whether it should at all. This discussion has been going on for decades in magazines like Edge and websites like Gamasutra. You have the formalists and the zinesters. The academics and the enthusiasts. Those who don't care about video games as an artform at all and those who think that artistic criticism of video games should be taken very seriously. There's also a fundamental disconnect between the western industry and the japanese industry that is a weird mixture of xenophobia, racism, and protectionism.

At this point I'm kind of rambling, but I'm just trying to explain all the different aspects of gaming that have culminated into the general attitude that launched GamerGate so long ago. I think it's disingenuous to say that it came out of no where or that it was strictly a reactionary misogynistic movement. It's better explained as a sort of nebulous disenfranchisement that had been building for years. There's a reason that Erik Kain, Totalbiscuit, Greg Tito, and Janelle Bonanno could have an hour long panel on the topic without straying into bizarre conspiracy theories.

All that being said, I don't think GamerGate really wants to talk about any of those things at this point. It's gotten too crazy. Good luck going into KIA or 8chan and bringing up those subjects. It's all ""SJW this"" and ""Shill that"". You're right that there is a very rabid ""This is good for GG guys! We're winning"" vibe that is present no matter the circumstances.","1414801056"

If laws were passed that allowed for people in disadvantaged situations to be given more opportunities to educate themselves and escape that situation, rather than specially choosing people of a race that is believed to be disadvantaged and disproportionally favoring them over another less disadvantaged race regardless of conduct or ability, then that would probably be better in my uneducated opinion.

I  believe in the idea of ""merit."" If a person should be judged by anything in their being it should be according to their abilities and the level of skill in comparison to others in the same field. It is entirely idealistic and most likely to work, but I never claimed that I had any way of implementing this. For any of this to work it would be necessary for people to be willing to give up racism as a whole, which would never happen.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Check Petfinder.com for some ideas on what's around you. Many of them have Facebook pages if not websites of their own. Some don't have a real building (shelters do, but many rescues are just networks of families fostering dogs) and many don't have adequate staff, or have staff that volunteer in addition to having full-time jobs, so sometimes communication can be difficult. 

People have some pretty mixed opinions on rescues. Some have very strict requirements and will deny people for something without giving them a chance to explain. I don't want to make them sound bad at all, they can be great organizations, but I just want you to go in knowing realistically that you may be denied for something like not having a fenced yard or having young children. 

There are hopefully a lot of options where you live and I think the fact that your wife stays at home and you have a flexible schedule will make you pretty appealing. I just want you to get a balanced view of things - too many times I've read posts of people getting denied by a rescue and then saying ""well I'm just going to go buy a puppy on Craigslist, they won't care if I have a fence or not.""

This kind of surprised me, as her's was the 3rd route I did, and I really didn't like her when I began (Found her annoying).

I can't say her route has the best story, far from it but I definitely enjoyed it alot. Compared to some of the other girls her route as a whole is not so heavy, especially Makina's it's almost light hearted in comparison. I feel I should point out, the thing I enjoyed most about her route wasn't so much her back story but the condition she gains as a consequence of it. Which is why I really loved her epilogue and after-story (despite the machine translations).

Does it get better?; Well certainly as a result of a sudden change in circumstances, her condition takes a turn for the worse. I mean, as you will discover, of the girls she is the most unstable, so much so that it's a surprise she hasn't broken down already.

I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” [**15**] Then the Lord said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him. [**16**] Then Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. [**17**] Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.

If you ever plan on wanting to have more than 2 people in the car than the fiat is already out. The dart does have some neat tech in it and the gt models make an amazing noise (probably the best noise of any compact car ever)  but a lot of the technology they're using is relatively new so it has some kinks. 

Also worth noting, if you plan on getting a fiat and servicing it at a dealer, the dealer must have a fiat license to work on it, we had a ton of people that bought they're fiat ay another dealership in another city and couldn't get it fixed in their home town because the dealer wasn't certified","1414801067"

Except...

I went back to my notepad where I listed the good, the bad and the ugly...and the uglies were very freaking ugly.  All of those consequences I didn't have? (DUI, arrest and such) are only because I didn't get caught.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","I think that you are focusing on the negative parts of your condition, yes sure you have a harder time making social interactions and such but you are forgetting the good things about it. You are in a great advantage in other aspects in comparison with other people. Aspergers makes you incredibly smart and focused and goal oriented. There are no limits to the things you can accomplish. I envy your skill to get in depth with the things you are passionate about, and how incredibly objective you can be. I don't have Aspergers and I have a hard time with social interactions and I get anxiety and such I wish I had your advantages. 

The people that were talking about Aspergers are uneducated and lack the understanding of your condition. I would like to think that the opinions that really matter are the ones that are based on a basic understanding of the topic at hand and that applies to every possible topic Aspergers or not. I pity them because they lack the mental strength to go head to head on a well argumented conversation and how they back out of them when you constantly come up with objective and intelligent reasons why their positions are wrong. I guarantee that you do not bore every single person you talk to. That's a fact. The Aspergers has a broad spectrum and your condition is not a checklist or a box that defines you. They made a stereotypical conversation that has nothing to do with you in particular.

Don't be sad about having your condition. It makes you special, and quite frankly everyone has something that one way or the other makes them different. (Mom has cancer, father left, dad's an alcoholic, there's people dealing with home abuse, with financial problems with bullying with depression.... the world is fucked up that way and everyone has to deal with something, trust me on that), You just need to remember that you can achieve everything you want to and that your real friends are going to love you and see you for who you are not by your diagnosis or checklist or a gene.

About your psychiatrist advice on arranged marriage, I think it is your choice. I resent her for telling you that maybe your only option is to do that. I think you should be able to explore and see for yourself what you are capable or not of doing and whether you can find someone in your own terms. I am not opposed to arranged marriages or anything like that, what I am opposed to is you giving up on your own experience just because ""generally people with Aspergers have trouble dating"". I would like to think that you should arrive to that option on your own terms and because is a decision you made, not because of ""i have aspergers this is my only option""

Shake off that conversation, let them have their opinion but don't let it get to you. :)","1414801069"

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","Most flash based arrays don't need to do 'tricks' like have been done for spinning platter arrays. The seek time is substantially lower, which helps minimize the write penalty.

Edit: Note: It's my understanding the write penalty is two fold: CPU (On card or software) Processing Parity, and in the case of spinning disk: Syncing heads across multiple spindles (seek time). Those two things take time. CPUs (On card or software) anymore are more than powerful enough to handle parity calculations. So, most of the write penalty comes from the time it takes to sync heads and write stripes across multiple heads. This is why (in theory) randoms IO workloads don't fair well on RAID 5/6 traditionally.  Combined with random writes that have the heads moving all over the place, overall seek time goes up. Given that there is virtually no seek time for flash, any of the penalties are kinda moot. RAID 5/6 to your hearts content 2at that point. I really prefer RAID 6 anymore, or ZFS RAID Z2 (I love me some FreeNAS!).

"youtubers","t5_2sj81","Hello Ninjabobb,

So i will go down the list in order of things asked:

1. Ninjabobb Gaming. It tells us what you are about, rather than just who you are.

2. Channel. firstly your Banner. Its not great. The text is really hard to read, and is not clear at all. I find the font on that background a little too glaring and its hard to focus on, let alone read. Next your Icon. I don't understand the reference, if it specifically an inside thing or something, but seems pretty our of place. Next your thumbnails need some work. Looks like you are going for too much info on each one. The thumbnail for your Search and Destroy vid Ep 4 is very hard to see and the sheer red on the black makes it quite difficult to focus on (I'm colourblind as well).

3. Your video wasn't all that bad. HOWEVER holy mother of deafness the music was too loud. You need to work on balancing the audio levels in the video as to not make every users ears bleed. On the subject of music i just want to make sure you went through the right protocol of using it. If you are looking for completely free music then check out http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/, otherwise you will get flagged for content ID. (If you are unsure if you could use this person said in their 'About' section to contact them if you wanted to use their music...if you did so then you can ignore the bit above :D)

Anywho enough from me. Tweak those few things above and i think you could have some interesting montage things. If you want to appeal more to a stronger audience for certain video game types then try to add more content into it to make it more interesting (i.e. if you are doing a CS:GO vid we want to see more of your killing than chasing people halfway across a map, etc.)

Thanks,

The subscriber/consumer side (thus far) hasnt been as violated like that. There are some ""soft"" bandwidth caps with some ISPs in a so-called ""trial"" but it appears with this proposal the ISPs wont be able to throttle the content its users request, however they wont be ""dumb pipes"" in that they will be able to offer their own competing services or have different pricing schemes and models.

I agree completely; I think Snape is one of the best characters of the last 20 years.  One thing that always bothered me about him, though, is that he's a lousy *teacher*.  He's a powerful wizard, a potions genius, and he got a pretty raw deal in terms of his growing up and his time at Hogwarts, and managed to do the right thing in the end.

But his *job* was to teach students, and he could have learned about teaching, but he didn't do that.  Instead, he regarded first-years as stupid (they're first years; if they know anything about potions, they shouldn't), and he despises Hermione, who's the only student in his class who actually reads the textbook.

Your right to property is not absolute in a libertarian state.  You cannot dispose of your property in a way that causes concrete and particularized harm to others.

"formula1","t5_2qimj","Calling it ""Virtual Safety Car"" is confusing I think, for two reasons:

1. It's not a full-course caution, as a Safety Car is, it's only applying to part of the track.

2. The current Safety Car rules already has this ""virtual"" aspect anyway, by virtue of the delta-times the cars must stick to.  For the last couple of years it's been standard practice, in all but emergency situations, for the safety car itself to stay parked until the leader comes round because the delta-times nullifies the race enough to suit the purpose.

I'd say finish learning Java, then try to learn Python. Python is object oriented, but gets rid of the, ""Everything must be inside a class,"" framework that Java forces you into. Thus, it helps put you in a slightly more C-like mindset. After that, I'd learn C.

Personally, I learned Python and C before Java, but I did learn a ton from Java that I didn't learn from either Python or C. So I can't say learning Java first is a bad thing... But I feel it might be confusing to go from the Java way of doing things to the C way of doing things.","1414801080"

"Robocraft","t5_2ygr4","While I can't answer about the most effective built, I've been in T10 for quite sometime now and I love medics. The meta is quite different and I feel medics do a lot more in that tier than any other. 

My favorite type of medic is a hover or wheeled medic. These are my opinions on the subject:

* Hovers have a lot more to protect but can maneuver easily and fast. 

* Wheeled bots can be fast and low to the ground

* Walkers are terribly slow, I've lost matches because the medic was still trying to get into the fight after the ground vehicles clashed. While their ability to navigate is superior to a hover, chances are if you're up on a ridge anyway; there are people who need healing more than a sniper. With that said Jumping medics are awesome or at least some with thrust. Walkers are not the worst thing though, just most tend to be poorly built. 

* Flyers are probably the worst type as anything that flies is heavily targeted. Right now the only big things in the air are bombers. If your goal is to save them, most of the time they'll end up on the ground anyway or can easily crash near a medic. For a medic it's generally better to run with the majority of the team than to save a downed bomber. 

Overall I enjoy medics who are able to position themselves well, stay with the majority of the group, be able to differentiate when to attack and when to heal, and does not charge in the front. I also love medics when they abandon impossible situations. If I only got one gun, run, please. At least see if you can get away. Medics are quite tricky to play but often than not I win more matches with one on my team.","1414801080"

"Eve","t5_2qil9","The WH life is not for everyone. But if you are the PeachOut from early FaF fleets that was a baller and would go into systems and find content and hold tackle like a boss I think that WH might be interesting to you.

If you like to consistently do one thing in eve it is not for you. If you want a guarantee of a certain type of activity (Solo PVP, Running Sites, Logistics, Exploration, etc...) you will never be guaranteed to be able to log in and do that single activity you love.

You log in and you check your Chain Map and you talk to your corp mates (who you trust beyond any other trust in eve imho as they have access to alot of your stuff and they literally build the star map for you everyday and if they mess up  you can be lost in space).

With your map and your corp mates you find what Bob (The God/Random Number Generator of WH Space) has provided you and you go do what is available. I love it. Everyday is a dynamic experience that is hard for people who live outside of WHs to understand. We don't get the 'joy' of logging in and going to your favorite ratting system or favorite FW spot, we get the unpredictable experience of jumping through a WH not fullying knowing what is on the other side and then trying to figure out what to do with what we find. Every day becomes a unique experience.

In practical terms here is the kind of stuff that can happen

* Scanning the chain for content, Building intel maps of jspace while checking towers for juicy targets (like a offline tower with billions in sma/cha/labs and a floating Rorqual in a C3)

* Solo/Small Gang ganks. As you Scan Jspace you find targets, maybe it is a group of domis running C4s or a solo Harbinger in a C1, maybe Capitals in a C5 or C6. With Delayed Local you can stalk forever, pull your corpmates, ping those offline for more numbers and gank (P.S. Scouts get the loot)

* Roll into someone competent you may be able to have a brawl that ends up with 10+b destroyed in a fight that requires everyone to actually be thinking and not just a f1 monkey.

* Evictions with 24/7 hole control with planning across multiple time zones with capital kills, local tears, people losing their minds Self-destructing their ships as they are getting evicted. Setting up Flycatchers to watch their logged off stuff show up dead to a tower killl days or weeks later. 
* Find a LS exit? Go roam FW in frigs

* Find a NS exit? Please let it be renters they are the best npcs to farm.

* Find a HS exit close to Jita/Amarr(It will be Amarr trust me) Time to run logistics into the hole. Remember no market means you and your corp have to have everything you need the hole ready to go. Logistics is seriously work.

* Find a HS exit and logistics are done? Mess with Marmite (we are in Brave so wardecs don't end)

* Need some Isk? Solo opportunites may exist thoughout the chain. Solo sites in c1-c3 are easy but also slightly risky because you are now the prey. If you have decent ships/skills/notapoor you can run stuff solo up into a C6 that provides some decent isk/hour. You may have a LS exit with tons of covert sites just begging to be run or a NS exit with a 7/10. Who knows Bob will provide.

* Large Scale Isk making can occur while running sites as a corp in a c5/c6. But if you are trying to join Jspace for the isk don't. Just don't. Go run incursions or something. Wait do come and run sites with your static not crit.

**WH life isn't for everyone. But I for one am glad it is for me.**

Sentinel lets you use your reaction to take attacks of opportunity even when normally you wouldn't, which basically means once somebody gets in melee with you, they STAY in melee with you. Protection works at any range, for any attack roll that doesn't also target you, so you can potentially shield buddies from arrows whilst moving up the battlefield. Or once you're already in melee and the BBEG doesn't plan to leave melee, sentinel isn't helping you there, but protection could make sure he targets you.

tl;dr Sentinel and Protection are two entirely different situations, both of which eat up your 1/round reaction, but each has their uses. If you want to be more tanky and really be the shield-barian, protection is your friend. otherwise, dueling gives you +2 damage.","1414801083"

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

But on the other hand I have a hard time to remember a lot of ""epic"" Sundays (when I wasn't drinking the day before). Compared to a shitload of epic Saturday nights. So I think it's a somewhat fair trade-off, as long as you don't overdo your drinking.

Like people said earlier, if you force yourself to skip on things you like doing (getting drunk on a Saturday), just to get the ""best possible"" out of your training, I think it's not worth it.

There is nothing new about that.  Furthermore, there has never been a case of transmission via saliva, and transmission via mucus is rare.  Even more furthermore, in the first few days a patient exhibits symptoms, the viral load in those bodily fluids are so low that you'd need to drink spoonful of it to get sick.  A few drops probably won't do it.   This isn't the CDC changing its tune.  This is misleading spin by conservative fringers.

Before the phrase *open source* became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of other terms. *Open source* gained hold with the rise of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), and the attendant need for massive retooling of the computing [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code).

"asktrp","t5_2y2sm","If 2 guys want a burger &amp; one has $5 and the other is willing to pay $50 to get it, what's the price of the burger?

If a man with money has SMV from it &amp; uses that on a woman, and another man with much less money uses SMV on another woman, and both women are aware of the money, what's the value of the money component?

Wouldn't it have to do with how needy each particular woman is for money to be a part of the ""relationship""?

It's not cast in stone as we all come from diverse backgrounds of skill, inherited wealth/none &amp; finance/income, cost of living, etc.

So... generally higher money means higher SMV but I think you can lose the SMV with the money by being way too easy in letting it go, vs the total amount you actually have.

By all means if Matt Damon or Brad Pitt are spending an affordable (to them) $500 on a dinner date, that would diminish little of SMV if anything compared to say, a person who clearly can barely afford that or is visibly borrowing money to do it, paying the same price. Even for the *same* woman on a date.","1414801089"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; But that's sort of the point of how the US is organized. The legislative and judicial systems we designed explicitly so no one could push changes through quickly.

Then its broken, because changes are pushed through quickly, and revoked slowly.

&gt;For me it's all about the level of taxation. A one time fee of $340 to purchase a gun is pushing on that limit where I don't care one way or another. **A $340 fee every three years just sounds like someone got too much power,** and decided to implement a stupid half measure to please their voting base.

They got too much power ~30 years ago when they banned guns.... no, thats not right, they didnt ban guns, they allowed -registered- guns, then refused to register most guns until the supreme court told them their registration scheme was unconstitutional. So now they are pulling the old poll tax scheme.

Its the same thing over and over, we enumerate a right, then people actively undermine it with regulations, if those regs are thrown out they try again in a slightly different way.
I kinda think we need a ""contempt of constitution"" law, to start punishing such actions.

&gt;The gun issue should be an issue of mental health. I don't care if some random guy I pass on the street is packing. I only care if that guy is ready to go off the moment he hears the words ""would you kindly."" I wouldn't feel any better about being shot by a psycho that can afford the fees.

So long as you make your determination based on open and conspicous due process that is appealable, provides the ability to speak on ones own behalf, and places the burden of proof on the state, then I have no problem with mental health being a factor.","1414801096"

SJW means whatever whoever wants it to mean. I usually use it in the derogatory, but plenty of people use it about themselves as a point of pride. Some of these people, I even look up to. 

And your accusation that ""It's a term used by angry little white dudes"" is sexist, racist, and ignorant as fuck. You are the exact kind of person I am talking about, at least if I had to classify your behaviour from our brief encounter. 

Minorities absolutely have to deal with shit. Shit other people don't. And this is unfair, unjust, and not the equality that I, and many other people, stand for. But the SJW attitude that you can only be racist if you are white, and can only be sexist if you are a man, is hurting the very causes that SJWs claim to stand for. No one will be equal while people treat people differently based on things they were born with or doing. ","1414801097"

"hometheater","t5_2rof6","Plasma is unfortunately being phased out due to lack of consumer demand. Joe Six pack wants the brightest most ""Vivid"" TV he can get or just the most size/money. Plasma TVs don't look great in a bright show room. 

Plasma over LED LCD: I recommend the F8500 because it is the best TV available for sale today. Some would put it even with OLED but LG's current offering has a few too many warts, so OLED is not quite there yet.

Plasma offers significantly better black levels, contrast, motion handling, and uniformity. Rtings.com put the F8500 at 8500:1 contrast ratio(ive seen other reviews with over 10000:1) while most LED sets can't break 3000:1.

My F8500 is advertised to have a 100,000 hour panel half life so it will last as long as any LED LCD TV.

"politota","t5_30uv2","&gt; Определиться с тем, что ты понимаешь под ""знанием о политических партиях в стране"" и плясать от этого.

Плохие новости: прямой вопрос о ""знании о политических партиях в стране"" предполагает непосредственно спросить человека об этом знании, по определению ""прямого вопроса"". Если же узнать о нём предполагается разбив проблему на гипотезы в духе ""чем больше человек знает о партиях, тем больше партий знает"", ""чем лучше человек знает о партиях, тем больше программ читал"", то соответствующие вопросы будут косвенными по отношению к исходному.

&gt; Там претензия была к тому, что ты используешь хуёвость и нерезультативность СВОИХ исследований как аргумент в пользу ущербности кого, кроме себя самого.

Ты даже не понял, что, во-первых, исследования не сугубо мои личные, которые я на коленке сделал как-то раз, и во-вторых (что куда важнее), что они как раз очень даже результативны, и истинное положение вещей вполне определяют.

&gt; Из чего не следует, что ты априори прав.

Из этого следует, что слепо доверять высказываниям людей нельзя.

&gt; В научном смысле?

Думаю, что уже да.

&gt; Споришь с утверждениями, которых я не делал.

Ты постоянно делаешь утверждения, которые выдают в тебе амбиции на ""понимание науки о человеке"". Идиотские и тупые.

&gt; Ну ка давай откатим назад - что ты пытаешься мне доказать тут

Ну вообще-то изначально была речь о том, что врождённые признаки не являются разумными основаниями для гордости (соответственно, гордиться врождёнными признаками глупо). Это если совсем в начало. А когда ты начал вой о том, кто лучше всех знает о человеке (и что дескать Кук лучше всех знает, как там его опыт куда был засунут и можно ли этим гордиться), то акцент сместился на то, что сам человек очень часто неверно знает и оценивает самого себя, поэтому только его мнение не является априорно определяющим.

&gt; И опять используешь гомосексуализм как оскорбление!

Судя по реакции, это тебя как раз и оскорбляет, хотя ты утверждаешь обратное. ","1414801105"

&gt;""__Womyn__"" is one of several [alternative spellings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_political_spelling) of the [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) word ""[women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women)"" used by some [feminists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminists).  There are many alternative spellings, including ""__womban__"" and ""__womon__"" (singular), and ""__wimmin__"" (plural). Writers who use alternative spellings see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define females by reference to a male [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology\)).

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Actually, Sherm does seem to have improved, **especially** in his run defense. I know it seems like not because stats but last year, I really think that last year he very much benefited from a lack of proper respect which gifted him with many fertile opportunities. This year, when planning for SEA defense, the QB&amp;WR have clearly prepared and schemed to deal with the strengths he brings. Plus, with the exception of the GB game, the execution against us has been stellar. It's actually been pretty impressive to see these ""weaker"" teams really stepping up to succeed at knocking us on the chin. It may seem strange but I've enjoyed watching the Hawks inspire such intensity from every team they have played this year (minus GB, of course. Their play in that game seems unnecessarily timid and weird and now has become somewhat of an outlier in my mind). 

Anyway. I don't really feel like he's regressed. I've noticed a few times this year the power of his presence.","1414801107"

* Anything black and red, show some originality, other colors exist. Because people just me too it so often, green motherboards have been eradicated, and that makes me a sad panda.

* Whenever a CPU block isn't lined up right, a part of me dies

* Seeing SP120/AF120/140s on anything. These are NOT good fans, I'm sorry to the people of Corsair but you need to update those things. NZXT's new 140mm fans that come with the Kraken are pretty damn good, meanwhile Corsair's are still loud.

* WD Black drives/850 PROs/PCI SSDs. Unless you're doing something with downright ridiculous data I/O, PCI SSDs and top tier products like the 850 PRO have little to no value added over the more traditional offerings. WD Blacks are horrendously priced for something that is louder, hotter, and consumes more power for marginal speed gains.

* People who overclock and buy the 970 Strix. The thing is probably one of (if not the) most power limited 970s on the market.

* Massive cases without much in them. I've seen people buy a 900D with no intention of watercooling and put only a single GPU in there with an ATX motherboard. You could have put that extra 200 bucks to just about anything else and it would have been an improvement, hell use the excess at a strip joint and it's still better spent.

I have experienced the more rigid, structured traditional forms of qigong but that inflexible attitude is not conducive to the kind of amazingly powerful experiences that can result from a real free form session. Of course it's not completely unstructured, just some very basic movements and instructions that lead to that intense free form state. And once you have entered the state, it can be interesting to practice some of the fundamental traditional forms to get a feel for what the real intention behind the movements may have been. 

I also find the microcosmic orbit practice unnecessarily rigid and uptight, but then again after years of intensive study of acupuncture theory I've concluded that meridians are probably bullshit. Not that acupuncture isn't effective, but these specific maps that were basically arrived at by some dude's arbitrary decisions thousands of years ago aren't necessarily completely accurate.

Note that the current CBA includes a clause that the players agree not to sue for past offenses.  The owners know it was illegal to enforce a salary cap in an uncapped year.  But the people who have standing to sue are the players, and they agreed not to in the new CBA.  So, unless the government wants to get involved and call it an antitrust case or something, the owners get away with it.

Still incredibly shitty to try to enforce a salary cap in a year that the players did not agree to one.  Flat-out un-American.  Similar to the collusion between Apple, Google, Pixar, etc. to not recruit each other's employees to hold down salaries.","1414801116"
"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Psychology research has shown that beliefs are not formed in the way we would hope. People's beliefs are tied to notions of personal identity and subject to all sorts of biases. Many christians believe in evolution, but for many, it is a subject tied to their views of what it means to be a Christian. These people are often exposed to faulty arguments that prey upon the tying of their identity and religious views to creationism. These ideas take on many of the trappings of science and it can be difficult for those who are not scientifically literate to understand that they are not science. That is why you often see people refer to the ""scientists"" who reject evolution, when they are referring to the people at AiG, CMI, or the Discovery Institute. 

At some level it is an issue of scientific literacy and poor education. Improving these things helps, but it isn't the whole story. Educating people about the fact that rejecting creationism isn't rejecting christianity, while being respectful of people's identity and views about their identity, is another important element.

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","#1 Catcalling is rude

#2 With my personality type I would dislike being catcalled if I were a woman

#3 Except Maybe if it was by someone extremely attractive 

#4 The above also applies to how I would feel as a man being catcalled by women.

##* I imagine the average girl being more attracted to personality than the average man and that the men catcalling might ""look"" more repulsive in their eyes than they might be judged from a purely visual standpoint and that this might be ""written off"" by the female if the cat-caller is just visually stunning enough and/or has an air of dominance and/or wealth and/or ""like a million things"" and also perhaps that expected length of relationship is low enough.

##Basically I imagine I would have higher standards as a woman rather than a man.

##*As a man from observing my small group of friends I ""believe/think"" that I care more about personality than many(Mean behavior against others make females less attractive to me and vice versa).
#5 I suppose part of what I was trying to say was that maybe some of the differences we have between us as men and women might stem from certain areas like sexuality were we are statistically significantly different in our way of being and thinking and that mutual misunderstanding may be the root cause of many conflicts. Also catcalling is rude..

From mostly only reading traditional super hero comics and having the DCU Multiverse and Marvel Universes down Cynosure was a bit whacky for me at first. 

Now though, with Ostrander's great writing and Truman's pencils I've really grown to love how whacky Cynosure is and they tell some great stories as well.

Looking at the source code it seems that Red Hat owns the copyright to at least parts of ConsoleKit. 

[CK git:](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ConsoleKit/diff/tools/ck-launch-session.c?id=685f2cbf9d69da556907ba6c935fe6ab1d2eeda3)

So it may well be that the Red Hat legal team sends a cease and desist in order to defend their copyright.

It is likely ignorance on the CK2 developers side that he doesn't follow the standard rule of renaming a forked project, but both he and this project may get in legal trouble because of that.

People want to hire those that will improve the working environment and know how to get along with others. Kind of like what Haymitch Abernathy said to Katniss in the first book. You've got to learn how to make friends with people even if you clash in some aspects.

Social maturity is just so important, but people always think that everyone has socializing down. It's assumed that everyone has someone to be friends with so it's never seen as something to address.

What Haymitch said in the movie:

""You really wanna know how to stay alive? You get people to like you. Oh! Not what you were expecting. Well, when you're in the middle of the games, and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death.

Classes are more of a broad template, and then you further define how you're going to play by your skill/gear choice. Any class can use any weapon/armor also...

[Here is a study that modeled the effect on decreasing sample size of a carcinogenicity study](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~hahn/psfile/papyang.pdf)


Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

According to the COPE guidelines, “Journal editors should consider retracting a publication if… they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error).”(COPE, 2009). The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Séralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)
  
Here are some responses to the original 2012 Seralini study, finding short comings in both design and statistical methods used.

[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
&gt;EFSA finds that the study as reported by Séralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
&gt;Based on Health Canada and CFIA’s review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors’ conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
&gt;On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

Here is a great quote on their opinion on Seralini 2012  
  
&gt;It should never have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The process of peer review which is usual before acceptance for publication in scientific journals has clearly failed here.

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  &gt;Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup® herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

&gt;**Conclusion on study Results**
  
&gt;The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAG‟s experts consider that the authors‟ interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the study‟s authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

"Cynicalbrit","t5_2tqbt","&gt;There's no reason it can't, but it should not, because those scores are going to end up on metacritic, which are going to effect bonuses, which could literally spell the difference between smaller devs keeping the lights on or not.

If a bonus, which is by definition ""extra money,"" is the difference between a developer staying open and going out of business, then that developer is doing something wrong. Seriously, that's ludicrous. As it is ludicrous to suggest that reviewers are in any way obligated to ensure developers get that money. Reviewers are beholden to the consumer, not the developer. If developers are losing bonsues because of Metacritic scores, they shouldn't sign those agreements. 

&gt;And here's the thing we bayonetta, it doesn't objectify women. The main character is one of the most powerful entities in that universe. She has ultimate agency. She is in direct control of her destiny.
Dressing sexy is a non-issue, character agency is the issue. A sexy character with fuckloads of agency is far better than a sexless character with less agency.

Of course it objectifies her. She is an avatar for the player, who undresses her at will. Agency? She's a virtual sex doll. She gets into various stages of undress at the press of a button. The camera focuses on her endowments. She is gratuitously provocative. 

&gt;Agency and control are the core issue when it comes to gender representation in media, any academic feminist would agree. Boob windows, short skirts, and cleavage are secondary or tertiary issues, it is control that matters and Bayonetta is one of the most feminist friendly games released in this decade because of the sheer amount of control and agency given to the main character.

She has neither agency nor control. And this is more than merely dressing sexy. It's stripping down to nothing, it is the camera zooming in on her endowments, it is her blowing seductive kisses into the air, it is the needless sexualization of this character that is at issue. And it's no surprise at all that it comes from a culture where women are considered objects.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Yes, birth precedes death; and yes, the timeline in your previous post is accurate (and obvious).  

However, to return to the original issue: not having been born would not prevent one from becoming enmeshed in samsara, because that has already happened prior to birth.  Birth itself is a consequence of karma, and that karma is a result of samsaric delusion (ignoring the special case of Mahayana Boddhisattvas).  Additionally, it is unwise to think of karmic unfolding as multiple sequences that are delineated by specific events within a yet larger sequence, because the unfolding of karma is interrelated, continuous, and all-pervasive (ignoring the special case of arhats and Buddhas).  In other words, birth is not a *beginning point* for a karmic unfolding, but rather another passing moment *within* the process of karmic unfolding.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; ""tumblr feminists""

how about you just call them the thing that you dislike them for, sexist women? or even misandrists. no need to drag feminism into it.

&gt;The same thing with SJW. It's not about the people fighting for equal treatment, it's about a descriptor of a radical band of people who are utterly unable to recognize that everyone has differing views and that it's ok. Rather, they seek to coerce compliance with their world view with totalitarian tactics.

man you really have been drinking the gamergate koolaid. peop0le like you describe may exist, and you're entitled to your opinions, but most of the people being attacked as ""SJWs"" aren't at all the way you describe them. if you look on the gamergate boards you will see people actively doctoring up ""proof"" of things that aren't even happening. they are generating and harvesting frothy anger for their own ends. it's kind of sad to see people who are basically just anyone with liberal views being demonized for wanting to help people other than white guys, or at least that's what's happened to some perfectly nice logical and egalitarian people i know.

i will assume you aren't one of the people just taking some photoshop's or false flags word for it, and actually looking in to things before developing anger for the individuals that you angry at.

&gt; I get on quite well with some feminists and some men's rights activists. I am a civil Liberty/rights minded person. I'm not questioning feminism, but I do strongly oppose a segment who call themselves feminist just like there is a segment of MRAs that are equally dysfunctional human beings.

we agree there. after seeing all the gamergate doctoring and impersonations over the past few months however (which i have personally caught red handed several times), i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of what you are seeing aren't feminists at all, but rather people who's goal is to discredit feminism honestly.

you sound like a pretty level headed guy though, so i'm sure you will come to the correct conclusions about whatever you see.","1414801140"

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","Hmm, if you have class with her its going to be tough…I had a crush on a good friend of mine for a few years and every time I tried to push down my feelings for her they just surfaced faster. What finally got me to move on was the classic cut-all-communication method. I stopped talking to her, deleted her from social media, the whole 9 yards. It was really, really hard at first but 100% worth it when I compare where I was then (hopelessly pining for a girl I knew I wouldn't work out with) to where I am now (a happy, healthy relationship). I guess some tips to get these feelings away fast would be to quickly jot down a list of flaws about her (tough, but no ones perfect. If you think for a bit you'll probably realize some things that you don't 100% love about her) or do something else to get your mind off it entirely. Maybe watch a movie?

One thing I did for my professors is give them a list of memorable interactions I had with them.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Thats why i said my last line. This just creates a situation where no1 gets sponsored.

Desrow is making a completely accurate point, CLG last year came out and said that they would have sponsored a mid tier Americans if the system would have been korean free. When i say Mid tier, I mean players like pokebunny and other Root players most people have never heard of. The reason why no1 is sponsoring those players now is because they get 0 exposure. 

Even if WCS would have been 100% only Americans it would have probably recieved 20k+ viewers regulary, just having that many eyes on you makes for great opportunities. You could have a shot to show how funny you are or your unique play style etc. It would have even been better if Violet and Polt had been included as the exposure for beating them would have been immense even if it was just a series in the round of 16. 

Why does this not translate to Koreans? well thats because they already show up in every round of 16 and onward, making them stale and boring no matter how good their games are, making their fame be reliant on top results. Foreigners are a rare sight, they also are underdogs, thats why everyone gets excited when they win. A korean winning is the same old stuff people have seen a million times.

Diversity is one of the MAIN problems sc2 is facing right now. Which is a result of how they tournament scene is, not just in terms of countries represented but also personality wise, most koreans behave generally the same way, the foreigners aren't very entertaining themselves beyond their underdog stories. You could even say hope is lost for most, in the Lol scene koreans are also by far the best, the reason why Lcs gets more viewers than the korean league beyond time zones is simple. Teams have a brand and players have gotten the chance to show themselves to the world, also there is always that hope that one day, that foreigners will win.

oh i got of topic, to get back to your comment. The reason why Soulkey or Rain isn't desirable for foreigner teams is because they can't market them well, also they are 100% reliant on results, what happens when they start to slip? They aren't talked about anymore. Beyond these facts most teams have probably learned from past mistakes; Korean signings usually don't go well. I mean there are a billion examples which are observable, even from an outside perspective. Since there have been so many failures, teams are even more reluctant to pick up new korean players. 

I worded this so poorly but hopefully i made my point without sounding stupid or made this unreadable at 1 am in the morning

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Thank you for this - this is a perfect description for why those ""innocuous"" comments are not acceptable or accepted by woman, no matter what the actual intention. 
There was a front page reddit post, a BLB, saying he just decided to reach out of his shell and say hello to strangers, and he ended up in the video. 
Things like that may happen, but just like guys and girls can't be friends (because guys want sex with the girls), a guy doesn't call out, ""Good morning,"" to a girl typically without some sort of internal motivation. As girls, navigating the, ""Hey, baby,"" and the, ""Hey hot mama, where ya going?"" on the street, even with the more mild comments, 99% of the time they are motivated by wanting to get something, and any reaction will invite more.

As an attractive woman, in safe places, like the grocery store, I will often nod or smile in response to a nice complement. On the street, Uh uh. Talk to the hand. 
It keeps me safe. ","1414801149"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I heard of a couple who wanted a dog, but they were good Christians, so they wanted a *Christian* dog.  Off they went to the Christian dog kennel, and looked at all the lovely dogs, and found a beautiful dog that was very clever, and could do all sorts of Christian tricks, and so they took him home.  Obviously, as good Christians, they immediately decided to show off to their neighbours, so they invited them round.  When the neighbours came, the couple said to the dog ""Matthew chapter 18 verse 4"", and immediately the dog pulled a Bible from the bookshelf, and started flicking to the pages, until he finally came to Matthew 18:4.  The neighbours were amazed at the skills of this fantastic dog, so they had a go: ""Isaiah 42: 12"", and the dog started flicking backwards until he got to Isaiah, and then again found the correct chapter and verse.  The neighbours gasped in amazement, so impressed were they with this clever Christian dog, when one of them said ""well that's fantastic, but can it do normal tricks?""  ""We've never tried"", said the couple, looking at each other, ""it can't hurt to try, can it?""  So they turned to the dog, and said, very clearly, ""Heel.""  Immediately, the dog jumped up onto his hind legs and pressed his paws on the husband's head.  ""Oh no!"" cried the wife, terribly embarrassed.  ""We'll have to take him back - he's a *baptist* dog!""","1414801150"

The fact remains that all official reports have concluded that it was an accident. The official reports were conducted by people who had more information and resources than the makers of this documentary. 

As a side note, generally when a ship is spying on another nation, that nation is considered to be justified in attacking that ship. Even if the motivation was to stop a ship from intercepting Israeli transmissions, which I do not believe that it was, then the attack would not necessarily be unjustified. If we found out today that a US ship that was spying on one of our allies had been attacked by the ally it was spying on, many people would argue that it was justified.

Personally, I prefer to stick to the official reports as they tend to be more accurate. There are often conflicting theories in history, but usually the official reports are the ones people choose to believe.","1414801152"

How Is Addiction Diagnosed?

In many cases, it is a family member or very good friend who raises concern about the patient’s behavior (rather than the patient himself/herself doing so). The first port of call is usually a GP (general practitioner, primary care physician, family doctor). The doctor will ask several questions, including how often the substance is consumed, whether the substance use has been criticized by other people, and whether the patient feels he/she may have a problem. If the doctor suspects there is an addiction problem, the patient will be referred to a specialist.

In cases of nicotine addiction, establishing whether or not there is an addiction is done at the GP-patient level. With more powerful substances there is usually an evaluation by a specialized addiction counselor, psychologist or psychiatrist.

Blood test - this may be ordered to determine whether the substance is still in the blood (whether the substance has been taken recently). It is not used to diagnose addiction.

DSM criteria for substance dependence - a patient diagnosed with substance dependence (an addiction) must meet criteria laid out in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association.

The criteria for drug dependence that causes significant problems must include three of the following:

Tolerance - the substance has less effect on the patient because their body has developed tolerance. They need more and more of it to get the same pleasure.There are physical/psychological withdrawal symptoms, or the patient takes the substance to avoid experiencing withdrawal, or the patient takes a similar substance to avoid experiencing withdrawal.The patient frequently takes higher-than-intended doses of the substance.The patient often tries to quit or cut down.More and more time is spent getting hold of the substance, using it, or recovering from its effects.The patient’s drug use causes him/her to give up social, occupational or recreational activities.Even though patients know it causes psychological/physical problems, they continue taking it.","1414801153"

Civ V just has flavour buildings, and AIs choose buildings based on flavour-needs (need culture &gt; make quickest culture building; instead of need great writer slot in 10 turns &gt; start amphitheatre in three turns [7 to build]).

I was thinking that they could fix the combat by making AI move units in 2 steps when at war: 1) move unit all but the last move point, 2) asses again whether to attack, move forward, or retreat. This would only be a bit of processing power and only during war (but basically makes their ""thinking"" take as long as having twice the units).

I don't trust many restaurants or even friends to prepare food for me, since the consequences of eating gluten are pretty severe for me. It's annoying for those close to me, since eating together is a huge part of being human.  Being gluten free is most annoying to me when I get super hungry when I'm not near home - can't just roll into a drive-thru for food.  My teenage son also has celiac.  I think it has impacted him more than me.  He is in scouts, and group meals are a pain on campouts.

"eu4","t5_2uqat","France, Ottomans, Brandenburg into Prussia, Sweden and now Castille are all pretty good choices. Prussia has unreasonably good troop modifiers, Castille was just given more moral modifiers in this patch i think, France/Ottos are just overpowered in general, and sweden has a 20% infantry combat ability bonus which is nice. 

There are many factors that go into fighting that you need to take into account. Always try and be on the defensive, there are no debuffs on defense. If you need to attack don't do it over rivers or into bad terrain like mountains (also if you play somewhere like italy ALWAYS sit in the mountains until the enemy attacks you, you will destroy their armies). Also having high army tradition for good generals is important. Try and get generals with as good a shock value (the second number) as you can because it affects how much damage you do to the enemy, especially earlier in the game before cannons. Finally make sure you have a good army composition. You want to have your armies width worth of cannons, and then a 60/40 split of infantry and cavalry with maybe a few extra infantry since they are the ones taking the damage.","1414801156"

However I'd venture to add if it's your own pet dog or cat etc.. that doesn't like someone it may be worth consideration. Animals can be very intuitive, if your pet takes issue with someone they may be sensing something is off about them and attempting to warn or protect you from someone they perceive as a threat to you. 
Or your pet just doesn't warm to new people easily. Depends on your pets normal behaviour of course but I personally wouldn't dismiss it if my cats didn't like someone. Maybe I'm just a crazy cat lady though lol.","1414801164"

He's a hard hero to play to his max, and he's a support, but when you get games like this it makes it all worth it.

You can report it to a school, tell your friends, etc.   The point is that comparing unreported rapes to false allegations makes no sense as a comparison.  They are tangentially related but not directly so and neither set of data is needed to create estimates for the other.

Based on police reported incidents only, the number of false allegations is estimated to be 8% to 10%.  It would be larger if you included non-police reported accusations, which you would have to do if you wanted to factor in reported rapes, or you don't have any kind of meaningful comparison.

MAYBE there's some technology that keeps the tracks functional as the train closes in, MAYBE that world found some kind of alloy that can handle what the freezing weather is throwing at it, and as we saw in the middle of the film, the train DID in fact pierce (or blast through) some ice and got out of it unharmed.

It's not intentional on my part. If a script is full of grammar errors it probably takes me twice as long to read, and I'm taken out of the moment every time my brain has to recalibrate.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Huh. I believe CC transactions also get batch processed at some point, or at least they can (with the merchant acquiring an auth code at checkout time). Though I don't know what mode Pay works on. For Pay, the merchant still gets the device specific account number (which does not change unless you remove and re-add the card, but is unique to each device). This device specific account number is essentially the equivalent of a credit card number, and is mostly treated as one all the way to the payment network, which does a lookup and finds the CC# it maps to. I believe the one-time token is just a cryptographic token that helps make sure the device specific account number is being sent by an authorized device.

The similarity I was pointing out is just the workflow of customer &lt;-&gt; cashier &lt;-&gt; aether. The customer provides a previously agreed upon ID/token to the cashier, which the cashier passes onto the aether to get money back later.

Of course, Pay is at least a magnitude more secure and private than plain old CCs being swiped.","1414801172"

It is absolutely hilarious that, even with the Forer effect, how often the horoscope is just plain inaccurate. Or maybe the inaccuracies are sort of an inverse confirmation bias? 

My nani used to have an astrologer on her staff. Even then, in the early 90s, I just couldn't get my head around how my fate has been destined in my palm or in the time of my birth. Unfortunately, this astrologer failed to predict the revolution in IT - and he predicted that my career would revolve around horses. 

The scariest part is that my sister-in-law and her husband, both people who are otherwise very rational and level-headed, are hooked by this numerologist. My wife lauds said numerologist, too, given confirmation bias. It is very worrisome how people who can think for themselves get hooked into this crap. ","1414801175"

To me, that speaks volumes. If you aren't comfortable cutting out half of the Eucharist officially, why should I feel comfortable doing it personally? 

And it isn't just the fact that I am receiving the body and the blood of Christ during communion. It's that I am doing it with my brothers and sisters, that I am connected to all around me who wish to share the Lord's table. I can't really put into words the kind of comfort I feel when I take communion but being denied Christ's blood hurts me, makes me despair, and makes  me feel disconnected. Even if the bread is enough in a canon sense, it's not enough for me spiritually. And that's why it hurts when people make fun of our grape juice. Because those who offer juice offer compassion, and people who make fun of it don't take the time to see it through the point of view for whom wine is broken and necessarily forbidden liquid.","1414801178"

"BasicIncome","t5_2v1jk","The creation of a basic income would lock the people into a dependence more deeply rooted than ever before. For instance, a system is introduced which resembles a basic income wherein every citizen receives a debit card provided by &lt;insert big bank here&gt; and &lt;insert credit company here&gt; that will have a list of restrictions of use. One of these restrictions is that every transaction must be recorded in full and processed by &lt;big data&gt; in order to be approved. If your transaction is not approved the card will be disabled until you call the customer service number on the back and sit in an automated queue, then after connecting to a person you will be chastised for purchasing something which is not on the approved list of purchasable items. 

Once these cards are in the hands of every citizen &lt;big bank&gt; will consolidate all current financial providers into &lt;mega bank&gt;. Shortly thereafter the system will be rolled out world wide and the elimination of currency will be official. At this point the very concept of wealth will be distorted based on whether you are able to purchase items that are not on the list of approved items.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Like I said, the housing market is crazy here. Expect to pay at least 1k a month on rent for your apartment unless you have a roommate. I visited Denver for the first time when I was flown in for my job interview, and I had a few days after my interview to look for an apartment. I went to twelve different apartment complexes, and they were  all at 99-100% occupancy, with most not having any available until two or three months in the future. PLEASE have a job lined up already when you get here - my fiance has been here with me for seven weeks and still can't find a job. He wouldn't be able to pay for rent right now if it wasn't for me. I actually found my job through Craigslist and my employer paid for half of my relocation expenses - it may be difficult for you to find something like this though unless you're in a very specialized field. I live in Southern Aurora at the edge Parker, and it's a very nice area. A lot of areas around Denver are brand new since it's expanding so rapidly, which means that there are many brand new apartments and shopping areas. One of the first things I noticed when I came here is that the air smells... well, cleaner than any air I smelled in Cleveland. it's also amazing how much bigger and bluer the sky seems than the gray sky I was used to in Cleveland. It's also a great feeling to drive to work everyday and see the mountains in the distance.  It has been difficult to leave all my friends and family behind, but on the bright side, everyone wants to visit me because I live in such a beautiful place.","1414801181"

"gainit","t5_2s9bg","It's probably slightly more effective since it's more difficult.  The problem is that dumbbells are more difficult to load in small increments.  If you got creative with it, you might be able to find a way to bump the weight up in small increments (think 1/2 lb or less) which should work fine.  You'll also have some difficulty with the logistics of getting the weights into place once they get heavy.

Just be careful - you really don't want to loose your grip while it's above your head.  It's a risk, but probably less likely to leave you dead than a unsupervised barbell bench.

The other difficulty is that it requires more equipment, more starting programs just make use of barbells to keep the cost down.

You won't be able to put enough weight on dumbbells to handle your squats or deadlifts, which are the cornerstone of most programs.  You'll quickly get over 200 lbs and need to relearn your form to do the work with a barbell.

I'd actually recommend that you just build some sort of platform or rail that you can set next to the bench to catch the bar in case of problems.  A couple bucks worth of thick PVC pipes or 2x4s and you should be able to make two stands that can be tucked away easily.","1414801183"

At one point, when the princess is (I believe) climbing up a rope to escape her pursuer, the guy yelled out something along the line of ""Why don't you kick him in the face?"" to which another guy responded ""Why don't you shut the fuck up?"" followed by the asshole yelling ""Why don't you make me?"" followed by the other guy somehow managing to climb onto the back of his seat and leap 3 rows back to the other guy and proceed to beat the shit out of him.

When the manager showed up, the entire audience demanded that the asshole who got the shit beat out of him be ejected while the other guy was allowed to stay. I didn't see any sign of police after the movie was over, so I suspect the asshole just tucked his dick between his legs and ran home crying.","1414801188"

There's multiple routes to satisfy a feature request. This is more like asking, ""Give me the one day version if there is one.""

I routinely walk through a feature, and tell the range of time we are willing to invest in said feature. 

Developers will then discuss ways to deliver a feature inside the acceptable window. 

Other times, I am told flat out,  ""No way.""

If there's a feature we are only willing to invest a day of developer time into, and it takes 5... then it isn't worth the money, and we find better uses of our resources. 

And I have never argued. Debated, discussed, and compromised... but never argued, and never refused or demanded results in an unreasonable timeframe. I've been fired from clients for doing just that. 

It ultimately depends on your relationship with your developers.

Maybe she should reverse her logic. She also doesn't speak for every woman. Maybe for some women, it is genuinely traumatic. 

I feel like us guys can't understand because we imagine being complimented on the street and think ""Oh, that would be nice"". It's a completely different thing when it is all day every day. You start to realize that it has nothing to do with you, or how you look. It's what you represent. They look at you and see a sexual object. After countless comments, it's pretty easy to see how this can get degrading.

This is not an extremist feminist point, it's actually a POV that many women share.

When the bad ending actually gives you some extra information, or a new take on things that is much better.

If you have to read through 15 minutes of plot for the ending, it should be well written enough to justify those 15 minutes.
