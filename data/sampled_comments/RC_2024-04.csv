"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","Keatts took a much smaller, much less talented school to the NCAA tournament when at times NC State was not even making it.  This school was UNCW (Wilmington).  He was brought on as savior of the program with such a great track record at a ""lesser"" school and imaginations ran wild with what he could do with a ""real"" team.  As a grad of both NC State and UNCW, I'm not meaning to degrade either school.  
  
However in his tenure things have not gone according to plan to put it lightly.  This year was looking to be his last as hopes and dreams crumbled again as they have for a time.  
  
What changed?  I don't think anyone outside the team knows specifically.  In my opinion, with a coach all but fired and playing their last game against Louisville, I think they put aside the bitter bullshit of needing to stand out on a bad team and save themselves and just started playing.  Who do they need to impress?  Not a coach, sure as hell not the national stage, and so to me they probably started playing for the first time as a team.  A couple of wins happens, and as DJ Burns just said, people stopped bringing BS onto the court, show up on time to every practice, and things have been improving.  It's easy to do those things when you win and I HOPE this is not what Keatts has allowed to be going on for so many years.

Add that words also have power and the statement/question ""Why not us?"" has carried significance in the NC State community.  They play UNC and Duke regularly.  They BEAT UNC and Duke, so why not [them]?  As they've beat higher seeded teams its become more and more true.  Why not NC State?  They've beat the best of the best.  Two of the best schools in the entire country, with a legacy to rival any teams in the country, so why not them?  

Now we're in the final four and the question remains:  Why not us?  Could Purdue, UConn, or Bama be any more formidable than the giants they are neighbors to back home?  Absolutely not, so if UNC and Duke are threats to the other 3 teams left, and NC State has beat them, then why the hell not us?",1711929600.0

I think that the battle of auction house might still happen, just on the last floor of the metabus, as ex machina is to relevant to the plot to just be skipped.",1711929601.0
"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","He said he was hungry and wanted to go fix something to eat. I asked him for sex and proceeded to give him oral sex. After that, I was trying to get to where we could have sex and I'd get my turn when he said sternly, ""What are you doing?"" ""I'm getting into place for my turn."" ""But I don‚Äôt want to."" ""I JUST DON'T WANT TO!"" He 'bout killed himself getting outta bed! ""I don‚Äôt have any desire for you."" 
Interestingly, I was the LL in my two prior marriages. Most of the excuses I read on this sub I've said myself! In this marriage, the roles are reversed, and I'm the HL. So I know both sides. Why was I LL in the first marriage? First, I was just a kid (15) and had no sexual experience at all! Plus, he, at 20, wanted sex 3 times a day, EVERY DAY. Well, lemme tell ya--that gets OLD FAST!! Now that I'm older, I can also say that he was very inexperienced (and I didn't know anything about sex or orgasms either)(it was mostly kiss, kiss, kiss, squeeze a breast, squeeze the other one, jump on top, hump, hump, hump, roll off, go to sleep. What was there to like? NOTHING!! 
SECOND MARRIAGE: He was 17 years older than I was at 21. He, too, wanted what I now feel was a ridiculous amount of sex: EVERY.SINGLE.DAY!! And, if he didn't get what he wanted, he'd refuse to acknowledge me for a period of time, AND he'd be hateful to my daughter from marriage #1. I don't think he was very experienced either. I had 1 orgasm with him in the 7 years we were married, and he fussed at me for it b/c he ""wasn't ready yet"". 
Judging from these 2 marriages and childhood sexual abuse from a stepfather, it's no wonder I'm so messed up. But, truthfully, I don't think I AM messed up! I think I am a product of my life experiences. I must not have the alcohol gene b/c I'd be  perfect for it. But drinking was seen as such a bad thing at home that I never drank til I was several years over 21 and on my own. 
Now, I am the one wanting sex all the time, and I don't get it. He just doesn't want to do that with me. And I hope not with anyone else either!",1711929601.0

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","While I definitely agree with the overall message of the post of spreading love to all of God‚Äôs children, regardless of whether they be gay or straight, it is simply heretical to say that the Bible says *nothing* about homosexuality.

In fact, aside from the one you mentioned (Leviticus 18:22, which you are correct about it mistranslation), there is:

 ‚Äú**If there is a man who sleeps with a male as those who sleep with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act**; they must be put to death. They have brought their own deaths upon themselves.‚Äù - Leviticus 20:13

‚ÄúFor this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged natural relations for that which is contrary to nature, and likewise the men, too, abandoned natural relations with women and burned in their desire toward one another, **males with males committing shameful acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.**‚Äù- Romans 1:26-27

‚ÄúOr do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, **nor homosexuals**, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor those habitually drunk, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.‚Äù - 1 Corinthians 6:9-10

‚ÄúBut we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and worldly, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for the sexually immoral, **homosexuals**, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.‚Äù -  1 Timothy 1:8-11

As you can see, there are a plethora of other verses that aren‚Äôt considered to be mistranslated (actually, I specifically used NASB, which is widely considered to be the most accurate version by biblical scholars), all saying that yes, homosexual acts are indeed sinful.

However, I do definitely agree that this shouldn‚Äôt stop us from accepting them into our lives, as, just like all of us, at the end of the day they are sinners. In that way, we are all equal under God, and thus, we have no right to stop each other from following and accepting Jesus.",1711929601.0

**Justice and Development Party (AKP - Adalet ve Kalkƒ±nma Partisi):** The AKP is a conservative and Islamist-leaning political party. It was founded in 2001 and has been in power since winning the general elections in 2002. The party promotes a vision of Islamic democracy and has pursued policies aimed at economic development and political stability. Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the current President of Turkey, was a co-founder of the party and has been a central figure in its leadership.

**Republican People's Party (CHP - Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi):** The CHP is the oldest political party in Turkey, founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey. It is a center-left and secularist party that advocates for social democracy, secularism, and Kemalism (the principles of Atat√ºrk). The CHP has historically been a major opposition party and has a strong base of support among urban, educated, and secular segments of the population.

**Nationalist Movement Party (MHP - Milliyet√ßi Hareket Partisi):** The MHP is a right-wing nationalist party that emphasizes Turkish nationalism, conservatism, and populism. It was founded in 1969 and has traditionally advocated for a strong centralized state, opposition to Kurdish separatism, and a tough stance on national security issues. The party has been a key player in Turkish politics, both as a coalition partner and as an opposition force.

**Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP - Halklarƒ±n Demokratik Partisi):** The HDP is a left-wing and pro-Kurdish political party. It was founded in 2012 as a merger of several Kurdish and leftist parties and organizations. The HDP advocates for Kurdish rights, minority rights, gender equality, and democratic reforms. It has faced challenges, including legal crackdowns and accusations of links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a designated terrorist organization. Despite this, the HDP remains a significant force in Turkish politics, particularly in the predominantly Kurdish regions of southeastern Turkey.",1711929601.0

All my private loans were variable for at least 2 years. At some point I was able to get 7% private loans. But I had loans that changed interest rates all the time. On average my loans were at least 13%. There was a point they got to 18% and there was nothing I could do. I was told oh they don't go that high and you can consolidate after you graduate.

Upheaval does too so not sure how much of an upgrade berserker is over marauder and swordsman (the spinning slash is also op). I'm just curious if any expert job will be better than these

The black mage just seems so OP though because it can target weaknesses and aoe them. The mage is just as good tbh. Losing flare and meteor to get whm spells seems like a fair trade to me (it's unusable in the demo though so meaybe breaker is too)",1711929602.0

"starsector","t5_2w0he","I‚Äôd typically be picky over a general system instead of a planet. Stable zones are a huge plus. Even poor farming is fine as long as hazard rating is below 150%. Anything higher means you‚Äôll be paying for it out of your own savings, while below 150% means it should break even or even be profitable from the get-go.

You can drop off your items and bulky ships at a few abandoned stations littered around the core planets, to save on costs with fuel and supplies. Just go out on a few surveying expeditions and look for a good system.

You‚Äôd want access to at least every resource. Food is pretty profitable, and you can make up for poor farming with items and an AI core. Ore isn‚Äôt very profitable, but rare ore is very nice. You‚Äôd also want volatiles somewhere, usually on a cold planet or gas giant.

Some optional conditions to look out for is very hot for taking advantage of a cryoarithmetic engine, not having volatiles on a farming planet so you can use soil nanites, a low hazard rating planet that doesn‚Äôt have the habitable condition for any nanoforge in heavy industry, and a planet with ‚Äúno atmosphere‚Äù specifically so you can use the special items for refining and fuel production.

"hoi4","t5_2zvvb","You can approach it a lot of ways as USA - between it‚Äôs massive industry, significant starting navy, and near limitless fuel supply, it‚Äôs very forgiving.  And the comp is dumb.

Broadly speaking, deathstacks are still the most efficient way to win navy.  That is, a single large task force of surface ships with 9 single-ship patrols.  Set the main body to strike force, always engage, never repair.  Set the patrols to never engage, never repair.  Control repairs manually (that is, pull a bunch out at a time and send them home in a single tf for survivability).

Your *ideal* patrol is a single CL with max floatplanes, engines, and the best radar and sonar you can make.  I usually add dual purpose guns and AA in the AA slot, as a solo CL set to never engage only really needs to worry about air attacks.

You want an absolute barest minimum of 3 screen ships per capital ship + carrier,  and one capital ship per carrier to achieve full screen efficienct.  *In practice*, with positioning issues, suboptimal conditions, and to account for losses, you want a minimum of 4 screens per, and 1.5 capitals per.  I usually run 4.5 screens per cap+CV and 2 caps per CV.

You want to limit your carriers to 4 per engagement (not per fleet), but if you aren‚Äôt building new CVs, you may as well dump all 5 in one (assuming you finish building the ones that start under construction). There are some tricks to get max efficiency with five CVs but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worthwhile in single player.

For subs, bin them in tfs of 8-15 and set to engage at low or medium risk (except late game subs, which can go high risk).  Avoid shallow water and enemy air cover.

NAVs and TACs with torpedoes are the best way to manage subs, but if you want to make ASW patrols you want something like: 1 of those scouting CLs and a half dozen DDs with good detection and depth charges.  One such patrol per sea zone.  Avoid enemy surface threats.

I like to put my strike force at the most forward major port I can, outside enemy NAV/CAS range.  With good fighter coverage.  That‚Äôs close enough to engage, but it avoids the biggest port strike threats.

At the beginning of the game, I dump everything into a single tf to train (as USA, since my first target is usually Japan, that means off the California coast).  I set all new ships to join that tf, and keep my pride of the fleet there forever.  As long as fuel is sufficient, that tf always trains, and I check often to get repairs when needed.  When war is imminent, I pull the fully trained ships out and array them as previously described.  The less trained ones continue training.

There are a lot of design philosophies.  Here are mine.

Roach DDs (or ‚Äúfrigates‚Äù).  Cheap guns, good engines, and that‚Äôs it.  These are your ‚Äútanks‚Äù, spreading hits around so nothing ever really sinks.  Most of my screens are these.

Fleet DDs.  DP guns, good engines and detection, some torps and depth charges and AA.  These are the core of my ASW groups, and I‚Äôll have a bunch of these in my main tf.  In between wars, I usually refit all my early DDs into these, and use them as ASW patrols (to keep the newer, faster, better ranged ones in the strike force).

Patrol CLs.  DP gun, max float planes, max detection, max engine.  I make one for each patrol tf (solo or ASW), a few spares, and sometimes a couple in the strike force.

Gunnery CLs.  DP secondaries, good radar and fire control, best engine, an AA, and the best light cruiser guns.  Either max armor or no armor.

Gunnery CAs.  Same deal but with heavy guns and some extra AA or DPs.  I don‚Äôt generally make these, but sometimes I convert starting heavy cruisers to these.

Heavies.  I prefer BCs to BBs for the speed, but otherwise the design principle is similar - radar, fire control, engine, AA/DPs, armor, and heavy guns.  I usually go 3 turrets and the rest AA or DPs.  These are big targets, so you need to be ready for air attack.

CVs.  Deck space, engine, AA.  Detection stuff.  NAVs.  I like to add fighters too but that‚Äôs suboptimal.  CAS is suboptimal unless their primary role is supporting ground combat.  I prefer to have the fleet focus on naval threats and use TAC to offer ground support for invasions.

Subs should be max engine, good torpedoes.  Snorkel if available.

The US has so many starting old hulls with bad designs that I would refit eventually.  It‚Äôs more efficient to just build new stuff mostly, though.  I start by building up the sub force and screens.  I‚Äôll finish the initial CVs and anything ready before July 1, and cancel the rest for new subs and screens.  Once I have a full fleet of 10 tfs of 12 sub2, I‚Äôll start on cruisers.

As new hulls open up, I don‚Äôt find sub4 or DD4 to be cost effective, and stop at sub3 and DD3.  CVs, heavies, and cruisers are all fine at level 4.

That‚Äôs all I got and dinner is ready.  Hope it helps.",1711929604.0

They then weave their lightfooted way from these unbelievable messes and masses of brambles, tree falls, ferns, and thorns to food and water sources via game trails.

I‚Äôd start with that thesis in mind. If you‚Äôre new to woodsmanship, it‚Äôs going to be tough at first. Eventually you learn to traverse this sort of terrain without too much hassle though. And when you get good enough, you learn to move like a ghost so animals (4 footed and 2 footed alike !) never even know you were there. Good luck brother!",1711929604.0

"Aliexpress","t5_2uq32","Normally the sellers aren't involved in this stuff, since aliexpress collects the money and holds it until 15 days after delivery is confirmed and all disputes are resolved, so the refund comes from them, and buying you do on aliexpress also.

So, basically, normally you buy it like you did the first time, without discounts, its the seller that responded that is doing something different than normal, which is why I wanted to point it out. So if the other seller doesn't respond, that's normal.

Oh, and there might be a chance if you buy the things again, they'll be combined again, but it'll depend on if they are Choice items which are usually handled and shipped by aliexpress, and if they are not, if they are shipped around the same time and aliexpress is doing combined shipping at the time. 

So if you want to prevent that, order one thing, wait until it reaches the departure transport hub, and then order the other thing.",1711929604.0

Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Sociopaths, and Psychopaths all have the same characteristics and traits.. their range of delusion and rage is usually what separates them. 
The sociopaths usually have severe narcissistic traits and tendencies, but use them differently.. usually to get someone to trust them (manipulating) and then they‚Äôll later attack depending on what the trigger was. 
Psychopaths usually have the narcissistic tendencies around thinking they‚Äôre the best .. google the special me acronym for narcissistic personality disorder and you‚Äôll see that psychopaths have the more grandiose tendencies and are less likely to rage like a sociopath would or a narcissist. They experience more gray rage which is the thought of it all.. but they usually don‚Äôt act on it, unless they‚Äôre not emotionally regulated.  .",1711929604.0

I have done the silly decision of building an itx build with air cooling. The pc is cool enough but this cpu is not.

My 3060ti is undervolted and is between 66 and 70 during gaming so I would hope to get the cpu down a little. My cpu is usually at 78 to 85 C during heavy cpu games and around 75 during gfx heavy games.

It was just a convenient coincidence that we managed to have such a group, and we utilized the content from the Level 1 and Level 2 part 1 E&T VolU materials. I'll say, it was a great program. The four of them actually grouped up and helped each other through, kept each other in check, and still tend to elevate each other as a ""cohort"" even years later.  One person dropped out and the others are very committed. I think it shows that such a program has merit, and impact. That said, I have utterly failed to repeat this success. What you said is true. SMs join on a different cycle than cadets. I can see setting up ""start dates"" and I may do so when I take Sq command, but it just does not have the same effect as it does on cadets. It's something I need to study further.",1711929605.0

/\ they make both a weapon mounted and handheld versions. 

That Elzetta is correct. Nice thing about the Bones is it can take multiple kinds of batteries, not all lights can run on both 18650s or CR123s. The Elzetta and the streamlight are both high lumen/low candela so they tend to not have a great throw range or hot spot, but they work great in other scenarios. I have come to favor high lumen/high candela which have a distinct hot spot and throw a beam a few hundred yards.

Or maybe it's about showing their love for you by taking care of you, like how guys show their love for a woman by wanting to protect her.  

Personally, the way I would handle it is if you've already said no thanks but they're so insistent, then let them.  But the moment they try to use it against you by saying they do so much for you, say, ""Then you don't have to do it.  I'm okay with doing it myself.  I did say you didn't have to do it to begin with.  You insisted.  This is why I didn't want you to do it in the first place.""  So it gives them the benefit of the doubt, but then if they do fulfill your prophesy, then nip it in the bud.",1711929606.0

There was still a tiny portion left of Raava inside Vaatu. Jinora with her connection to spirits was able to sense where Raava was and draw her out for Korra to find. Then when Korra purified Vaatu, the reverse would happen where Vaatu would presumably be born in Raava again. Unalaq died because he was destroyed along with Vaatu (although only Vaatu can come back).

This is about ""thoughts and prayers"" being a fucking joke response, but the only one that the GOP and the NRA (at least, before they went bankrupt) could condone, with the full knowledge that the NEXT tragedy would happen in the next news cycle. 

Because that's how often it's happening.

You don't need to agree to have your rent raised, it can be raised as follows

1. every 6 months, with 6 month's notice, if the the landlord is a member of the Saskatchewan Landlord Association. 
2. Or it can be raised once per year with one year's notice if the landlord is not part of the Association. 

You just need to be notified accordingly.

"selfhosted","t5_32hch","I know I am late to the party, but since I stumbled upon this while trying to figure out the exact same thing, I thought I might share how I did it (without any of the command-line approches)

1. from ttrss, without any plugin, I used its ability to turn any article list into a feed:
   1. click on starred articles
   2. at the top of the page, an RSS icon gives the url of the same list but turned into an XML feed.
2. tweak the URL using [this documentation](https://tt-rss.org/wiki/GeneratedFeeds) to export as JSON a bulk of only 250 starred articles at a time (to avoid any 413 error during import into FreshRSS) by appending `&format=json&limit=250&offset=0` to the URL (offset must be 0, then 250, then 500 and so on).
3. save each of these bulks to .json files
4. edit each file to change the ""articles"" element: rename it as ""items"" or just keep its value in the file and nothing else.
5. import them into FreshRSS from the web interface

The articles will be imported as ""starred"", and into a ""fake"" feed named ""Import"" under the category ""Uncategorized"".",1711929608.0

In terms of what I want to actually, I want to work on aircraft structures. Particularly as a designer I love using CAD and the idea of bringing things into reality using CAD is really interesting to me. 

I've tried my best to learn as much as possible from the electrical engineers I work with. I feel like I've gotten good at being able to find the system requirements and determine how to to design a cable for whatever use case, but one of the main issues I have with it is the why factor. For example I know when to use 22 AWG wires and what type of contacts are needed and how to determine what type of splices to use but no one really goes into the why or how these things are determined. I pretty much pick all the parts for a cable from a bunch of parts my company has in stock that were previously used in other cable assemblies for the same or similar applications. This is where I feel I lack the basic fundamentals of what an EE would learn in college. 

Although I can see your point in that making cables is a mechanical task from my experience at my company most electrical guys are working cable designs. I'm not sure what else they do but in meetings they do know a bunch more of the electrical requirements for systems we work on. The mechanical team seems to be working on purely mechanical things such as designing structures and doing thermal and environmental testing, which even though I ask I never really get the opportunity to work on these things for whatever reason. This is why I feel the need to find a new position where I can learn more about things I'm interested in and work on things I find to being meaningful instead of what feels like to be endless day in and day out cables.",1711929608.0

"Futurology","t5_2t7no",">Companies are ALREADY doing that. Do you think literally all research towards curing cancer is funded by governments?

It absolutely is yes. In the US this is done through the NCI (National Cancer Institute), and it's funding comes from the federal government.

>The profit motive is the main motor for large-scale coordination and cooperation that lead to innovation and progress

This is absolutely wrong. Despite that, I can't blame you for saying it, you are regurgitating capitalist dogma that has been promoted heavily over the past 100 years.

But it goes to a very important point, because it shows how powerful a paradigm is. And how important it is to break out of that paradigm, which is exactly what Solarpunk is trying to do.

We have been taught that capitalism EQUALS commerce. In other words that any and all free market systems, are by their nature capitalist. And capitalism always equals a free market.

Both of those paradigms are wrong. And easily disproven.

I'll take the latter first. Capitalism inevitably leads to monopolies. The only thing keeping a capitalist market from being a monopoly is that monopolies are illegal in most countries. Which puts it on the state to deny mergers of companies that are too large. Which happens, all the time.

Without that most markets would eventually just be dominated by one actor. And that would still be Capitalism. There would be no free market, because nobody else could start a business and run it successfully. But the means of production would still be owned privately. 

As for the former. If it was illegal to hire people on a salary, all companies in the world would be co-ops. There would still be a free market, since anyone can still start a company and have that company be successful. But the profit would be shared by the entire labor force, making it a non Capitalist free market.

As for the profit motive being necessary for innovation. This is the biggest misconception I think.

Look at Google. Google has a litany of failed projects under its belt from the past decade. Stadia, Google+,that buildabke cellphone... And even when it came to a market that should be right up Googles alley, Gen AI. They lost to a totally new upstart company, OpenAI.

In fact OpenAI beat Google, Facebook, Apple and Sony at the AI game. Why is that?

While Google can be er be replaced as the worlds search engine, they hold that solidly, there's no innovation in a company run by investors. 

No engineer is going to give Google their ""big idea"", they're gonna keep that for themselves and start their own company. So google is incapable of innovating beyond their already monopolized marked, despite the massive amount of profit it would have yielded them.

The person that win the AI race, did it, not just for profit, but because it was his FIRST go at making it happen. 

That's motivation BEYOND profit.",1711929609.0

"masterduel","t5_3l4bg9","Mikanko only really has two gameplans - kill you on turn 2 with a combination of Kaijus/Lava Golem and their damage-reflecting monsters, or set up Mikanko Rivalry + an untargetable Hu-Li and hope they make it to turn 4 to try the OTK strat again. There are go-first variants that do a little more than that, but they‚Äôre also less consistent at being able to immediately end games.

If they open the god hand (some combination of Golem + Kaiju + Arabesque + Ohime + Hidden Armoury), there‚Äôs not a lot that some decks can do about it. A trap deck like Labrynth might be fine if they‚Äôve opened a way to prevent the OTK with a backrow card, but monster-centric decks can‚Äôt do a lot unless they also have enough handtraps to stop the opponents engine cards.

If they open a more reasonable/realistic hand, there‚Äôs usually more you can do. Don‚Äôt be too trigger-happy and burn interruptions early, since you don‚Äôt really want to let them pivot into plan b without using most of their resources. Hold Ash for Arabesque, hold Imperm until the moment that they threaten the ability to get Hu-Li‚Äôs protection online, and use removal on their equip cards as they activate the EFFECTS (not the cards themselves). If you can put the opponent in a position where they have two Mikankos on board but aren‚Äôt able to assemble lethal, you‚Äôre in a good position.

For SE specifically, it‚Äôs a bit weird. Against going-first variants, use Poplar to search Original, and hold onto it as long as possible - try and out their board without having to use it, so whenever they trigger Rivalry, you still have a card in hand that lets you extend past their disruption. If they only have one set card, an early Knightmare Phoenix can bait it out without committing much to the board. Against go-second variants, it really depends on whether they have a Kaiju-esque card, and what they use it on. If you have an Apo they can‚Äôt out, you can probably stop all of their engine effects. If you‚Äôre able to retain IP, consider using it to make Goddess by using a Mikanko name as material. If all else fails, you probably have handtraps to fall back on - just time them wisely, and prioritise staying alive over shutting them down completely.",1711929609.0

Then there's the fact that you have to set it all up, deal with CPU Pinning, hooks and whatnot. And after that you come to the anticheat part, which is relatively easy to circumvent (at least BattlEye and EAC). If you get BattlEye, then you better pray to god you have a good configuration, because that thing is trash and has tortured me for months by choking the host somehow, which then chokes the VM.

I'm not joking. You need therapy. So do I and so do most of the population.

Therapy can have immediate benefits. However, I've been in it for a few years now and I can see clearly how much I have grown and changed for the better. It's an investment in yourself. Over time, it gets better and better. 

An even more immediate thing is going for a run. I don't mean go for a run the way people who have run for a long time do. 

I mean: download a running app like 10K that slowly ramps up your practice. The first day of 10K has you walk for a minute, then run for a minute, for I think six times (plus walking 5o warm up and cool down).

It tells you exactly what to do. So just put on headphones with some good pumping up music, and head to a nearby high school or college with a track. That way you can run without having to worry about cars, or think about anything at all. There is a 99.5% you will immediately feel amazing afterwards. The more you do it, the better it is. The affects last all day. 

Or run on the street if you have to, just be careful.


One more thing to try: mushroom microdosing. There is tons of info online to look up. It's saved me many times. 

But you need therapy. Bottom line.",1711929610.0

Therefore, the most sensible thing to do is just to stop burning fossil fuels and use green energy instead, rather than burn it and need to both build carbon capture infrastructure and even more green energy sources to power it.

Planting trees is great to recapture the carbon from burnt wood, but you‚Äôll never recapture the carbon from fossil fuels.

Once we have stopped burning fossile fuels and we have excess green energy, then we can look into carbon capture to bring down levels. But it‚Äôs a losing battle so long as we are still burning fossil fuels.",1711929611.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","head to community college.  find out the logistics of how to register.  find the cashier and open an account so you can deposit money to pay for next semesters classes.  back then it was $8 a credit but soon it jumped to $13. 

meanwhile confirm that you passed the CHSPE, get that transcript sent to you at the college.   

as soon as you have confirmation that youre a legal high school graduate (as i was as of the 2nd week of tenth year) stop attending high school.  maintain your schedule by tutoring CS & Engr 3 days a week at the university (which I have been doing since the beginning of seventh grade) and start community college as soon as possible.  

take auto mechanics and cosmetology because you  (felt blocked from shop=therapeutic) and you want the skills and opportunity for artistic expression. 

get your AA and two professional certificates by the time, your former classmates graduate high school

Keep your parents & siblings in the dark about as much of this as possible, until they hear something about it from the high school. There won‚Äôt be a truant officer because you‚Äôre a graduate. 

after you turn 18 apply for financial aid without your parents involvement.  

remember what you learned from your client, Jimmy‚Ä¶ That there is money in developing land in places, people have not yet expressed a desire to live in

Look for county acreage (not city) and lot size of at least 5 acres, preferably more‚Ä¶ With at least dirt road access.  

Buy your home and pay it off‚Ä¶ The more extra you throw your mortgage the quicker your payment stream will be over and your total interest charges will be less‚Ä¶ A lot less

‚Äî‚Äî-
comparison points:

I have less than a half a century look back to when I was 16, but I started working with clients as an independent contractor when I was eight.  

The part about Jimmy is not only true, but it occurred before I was 17.  

The part about graduating high school in 10th grade is legally true.  I took the California state, high school, proficiency, examination, and the state mailed a legal high school diploma.  my school was supposed to present it to me, but they pocket it and gave it to me about three years later, one week before graduation

so I have two high school diplomas.  

and I don‚Äôt yet have my associates degree, my credits are spread across five institutions thus five transcripts

And if I could get my associates degree completed, then the next institution would have fewer requirements for me‚Ä¶ As compared to the requirements without my associates degree (net of the one science class that I need in order to complete my associates)

It‚Äôs basically a whole semester more unless you can check the box has associates degree

in 1974 I was servicing two or three clients per hour tutoring them in the first year of engineering and computer science course work

helping them solve their problems in their code.  

Without the benefit of seeing their textbooks, or hearing any of their lectures

>**2 vs 9**

>Both can be high on agreeableness, be people pleasers or take the role of a helper/sidekick.

>However, 2s are much more proactive (sometimes to the point of being pushy, bossy or impulsive), while 9s are more passive and don't seek others out quite so actively.

>Also while both can make their lives all about othes to the point of neglecting their own life, with 9s it's that they tend to want the other person to have a plan for them, to give them a sense of importance & aliveness. The 2 has a plan for¬†*you*¬†& wants to be the one who made you get your act together.

>His kicking is fine not sure where you're getting that from.

I think it's not international level for a 15. Kick choice is bad and he doesn't have the length or variety. Just compare it to Mack Lowe or Keenans


His defence is poor. He tackles high and isn't strong enough to pull that off. It goes under the radar cause Leinster don't have to defend very often in games he's playing URC but his reads are suspect too


>Larmour was the only one of them not too miss a tackle.

Also, many of the smaller prey are capable of fighting back so they tend to bite/inject venom/let go and wait for venom to take down prey before eating it.

Possibly your mind recognizing your body though ?
How you start to pass ?
Maybe you already pass really well and your brain recognizes this and alleviates your discomfort a little ?
Whatever this may be, you're still young so I'd advise you to take your time for a little bit and maybe sort through your emotions, because being sad for the wrong reasons is never a good thing.

My professor, parents, and even UCLA students that I've met on campus, recommended me to go to USC, for my specific major though.

It's a tough decision because to the average Joe, USC unfortunately has a tarnished brand, from the college admission scandals, sexual harrassment scandals, etc, but USC students are very successful after graduation, which is what should matter more.

But, USC does not worth the extra tuition, I was fortunate enough to not need to pay tuition at UCLA and USC, I'd absolutely go to UCLA if USC cost a lot more.",1711929614.0

Which is exactly why those who demand bike lanes ""protected"" in the places where the danger isn't, and so dangerously misrouted through the intersections where the danger is, will accomplish nothing but to make biking int the city more aggravating and more frustrating.

All one has to do is look, and it's obvious that we're confingin the bikes/e-bikes/scooters that should be the primary mode, to an unworkably tiny fraction of the street.

NY bike policy isn't pro-bike in the slightest - what it actually does with its bad physical design and dangerous must-use law is limit bikes in order to preserve the priority of cars.

Reality is that if an Amerstdam-type system were actually built in NYC, most of the current bike usage in the city would have to stop: delivery would end, and people who pedal bikes because they want to would have to move away to somewhere where one can actually still *ride* a bike and not plod along at walking pace.",1711929615.0

You don't treat a woman or a man like an object, You don't enter a woman's house without her permission and rudely lay your feet on the table, You don't try to force yourself onto a woman let alone force her to marry you, You don't try to imprison her father if she says no to marrying you, You don't try to lead a lynch mob against her lover, You don't try to kill her lover all because she loves him more than you. Stop trying to minimize Gaston's actions. I'm tired of people doing this. I hate it when people say, ""Oh, he's not that bad."" Imagine if you applied for a job at a Subway, but didn't get a call back for an interview and your response is to enter the Subway and start shooting up the place. It's no different than trying to force yourself onto a girl you're obsessed with. Gaston is a pervert and an attempted murderer, just like the rampage shooter who didn't get a call back for an interview. People who think Gaston is a ""Good guy"" and the Beast is a ""Bad guy"" is mean spirited. it's not only victim blaming, but it also comes off as a judge jury executioner mindset.

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","Then how come an imperfect human can know the difference between right and wrong in the world to do good/harm and know well enough that we should love our children unconditionally and still don‚Äôt cast out our own children when they do wrong, yet god is better than that and does so? I don‚Äôt want to believe in a god that is like that and condemns his children to damnation for all eternity for being the creatures we were made to be: imperfect. 
I don‚Äôt think the problem is that god isn‚Äôt perfect. I have no doubt that they are. I just honestly don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the same god that most Christians make ‚Äòhim‚Äô out to be from the book we came up with ourselves and picked and chosen which books were to be included in that along the way and omitted the ones that didn‚Äôt serve our indoctrinated purpose and want to act like it‚Äôs a good thing when he condemns those less than what we deem are good enough and the rest are to just rot and suffer because that‚Äôs just his will. 
It‚Äôs not god that can be improved upon. That‚Äôs not my problem. It‚Äôs our vision of what kind of a god that we actually worship is that needs work. If god is so perfect and I have no doubt that they are, why would we want to believe in them as being one who condemns and rejects those who fall short when we ALL do?! 
The only way we suffer is when we find ourselves short of being one with god. That is hell. It‚Äôs here on earth, here and now, not some place we go to after we die and it‚Äôs a choice, no acceptance required since it‚Äôs on us to do so. Because a perfect god wouldn‚Äôt condemn us. That‚Äôs like saying a good person can still murder and have it be ok. It doesn‚Äôt work like that. Even we as imperfect humans know better that to say that‚Äôs no ok and doing so doesn‚Äôt make you a good person. Yet a perfect god who condemns is? That doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Just a few reminders...

* Please take a moment to **review the sub rules**. Ignorance is not an excuse for rule breaking.
* All posts require a timestamp with the knife. This is a picture of the knife with your handwritten username and the date to prove you possess the item in question. At least one photo must include the knife open as well.
* Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services if you are under 25 flair, with any fees included in the price.  If you have over 25 flair, all methods of payment are allowed.
* All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 
* Please **DO NOT** remove prices after an item is sold. Prices MUST stay on the post. Please wrap the item in `~~` characters to ~~strike through~~ the text instead.
* Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  
* If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  
* If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear in both value and number. Please consider using r/edcexchange as well.

As always, please don't be a dick.

That comparison shouldn't exist in the Australia sub, and the amount is significantly oppressive for some people considering their HECS debts are going up by 5-7% year on year thanks to inflation, which is outweighing the amount they can afford to put in it.

"NYCbitcheswithtaste","t5_8v7p8h","yes ive been single for like 5 years. i don't really do well in relationships either. it didnt start off purposefully but now the idea of actively dating makes me lurch in fear lmao. i guess im not proud bc i think having healthy romantic relationships is beautiful and amazing, but personally id rather be single for the rest of my life than risk the insanity i put myself thru when dating lol. there's also just a lot of work i want to do before dating anyone.

my family lately has been pushing me to date and i'm getting to the age where it feels kind of weird to be SO single, and single for so long lol. i don't actually mind being single that much, i mean the world is set up for couples so it makes life complicated but i feel ok being single. it's more the fear of how others perceive me tbh. like, just showing up everywhere alone. or people being like soo are you seeing anyone and im like lmao not at all. it also feels like one of those things like, the less i do it the bigger it seems.",1711929619.0

"insomnia","t5_2qh3g","Good question.  Everyone experiences some sleep inertia upon awakening, though it usually dissipates completely within about a half hour.  Insomniacs usually manage to adjust and perform comparably to good sleepers on cognitive tests.  

The weed typically diminishes REM, which can affect mood, and it can take a month to completely metabolize out THC.  After 5 months it's a safe bet it's all out of your system.

The amount of time since the weed, the improving sleep, and the tension headaches all suggest the possibility something else besides the sleep is going on.  The stress or whatever is causing the tension is probably a factor.  Might try ramping up stress management like vigorous physical exercise.",1711929619.0

"DadsAndBoys","t5_rparc","Woah there bucko! Our stats show you either haven‚Äôt interacted enough in the community yet, or your karma level is too low. In order to maintain and preserve 
community engagement we must now ask that you take part in the subreddit a little more before you can submit a post. **PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THROUGH, THANK 
YOU**

In order to post here you will need **3+ comment karma** that is specific to this subreddit only. Some of the ways you earn this karma is by:

- Showing our members some love by **commenting** on their posts. Make as many comments as you can, this will get you there quicker. (We advise you not to ask for 
karma in these comments in the event that Reddit intervenes)
- Introducing yourself in our [monthly conversation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/1b3sdue/monthly_conversation_thread_march_say_hi/)
- Request a unique [custom user flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/14eg720/get_your_custom_user_flairs/)
- Taking part in our [Q&A thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/19caszw/qa_thread_say_hit_me_or_shoot_automod_will_ask/)

Many apologies, we hope you can bear with us through a [transitional period](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/1bsjlsl/apologies_due_to_an_unmanageable_amount_of_daily/). While initially we were able to help out with your karma goal 
by upvoting your comments, it's become incredibly difficult for moderators to keep up with requests. So for the time being unfortunately you will have to wait until 
you have reached the karma goal yourself. There is no telling how long this will take, but the more you comment the higher the chance you will reach it. You will be 
notified by our automod via private message once the karma goal has been reached. 

These terms are necessary for us to continue providing a safe, positive and engaging community for queer men of all ages **18 and up** to connect with each other, 
that has always been the true purpose of this community. Thank you in advance for your utmost patience, and for taking the time to read. 

So if you're up to the job, go forth and be a friend to someone! <3

These are my reasons for my thoroughly negative assessment. I have posted them a few times over the last months and have not found any reason to change them.

In short, Bitcoin has failed to meet any of its promised sales pitches.

* It has failed as a currency. Its volatility is extreme. Transactions are slow and expensive, and the transaction volume is inherently unscalable. Supplementary protocols like Lightning are fundamentally flawed. Usability for consumers is generally terrible.
* It is unreliable as a store of value. It has not proven to be a hedge against economic downturns or inflation, as the year 2022 has highlighted. Artificial scarcity alone does not give something lasting value. It is not a long-term investment. As an unproductive asset without internal cash flow, its price action is driven by short-term speculation, FOMO, and Greater Fool mechanics, ultimately forming a speculative bubble.
* The many notoriously unaudited actors in its space, such as Tether, are not worthy of trust and have faced accusations of dishonesty and market manipulation. Consumer protection is nonexistent.
* Despite having existed for 15 years, real-world adoption is insignificant, with uses largely confined to gambling, illegal transactions, and generating fees for financial intermediaries such as exchanges or money managers.

The movement is largely driven by abstract storytelling and FOMO, both at the personal and corporate levels. A key factor is the lack of substantial knowledge or experience in either finance or technology among most enthusiasts, with the majority lacking both.

Only a very small number have practical experience with developing or deploying cryptocurrency technology or have tried to use it seriously for tangible, real-world use cases.

This leads to their being convinced by frankly absurd narratives, such as scarcity implying value, the comparison with gold (a questionable asset in itself), or decentralization being unquestionably an inherent good. In reality, these stories are just excuses to justify the irrational expectation of effortless infinite future returns from an inherently useless asset. At a fundamental level, ""line goes up"" is all there is to it.

The central narrative of decentralization and trustlessness is mostly a mirage. The majority of actual end-consumer services require users to trust unregulated service providers. The majority of the network itself is concentrated around a few mining pools that are able to censor transactions. Ironically, proponents are fleeing from supposedly untrustworthy democratic governments into the arms of unsupervised, unaudited companies and fraudsters.

Exchanges, money managers, and other intermediaries, of course, love to profit from service fees. The fact that a product is nonsensical does not prevent them from selling it to those willing to pay for it. It is just like Walmart selling homeopathy. It is nonsense; Walmart knows it is nonsense, but people pay them, so they sell it.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.

* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.
* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.
* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.
* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names
* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)
* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.
* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.
* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**

You have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever. There are no refunds!

Unable to receive group messages
hi, i noticed that i am unable to receive messages from some people in group messages but can if we text individually. i have a Pixel 7. most people i do receive the texts from have Iphones but i'm having trouble with both Iphone and android users. i called ATT and the first rep told me to call verizon as thats where i just switched from 3 weeks ago. verizon can not help me as i no longer have any account with them. second rep told me to do a ""google account reset"" but that could affect my ability to text for up to 48 hours. i was told to call back after 48 hours if it still did not work. seems like these people dont really know what they're doing, just googling possible solution so i thought i would ask here rather than waste my time calling ATT over and over. thank you

I am having the SAME EXACT ISSUE with my Google Pixel 7. Can't get group texts from some people but can text individually. Left Verizon to come to AT&T less than a month ago. Tried everything discussed here. Talked to tech for 2 hours and couldn't resolve it. Assigned a case number but they can't respond for 4-5 days.




Well you are in this for the long haul. The issue stems from Verizon. It looks like when we left Verizon we had two mms profiles and they only deleted 1. Verizon will refuse to help you and if you can finally get att to help (took 2 months to get to the att office of the president) then you still have to wait because they have to make a case with Verizon.¬†


So options are 1) wait forever 2) return to Verizon (can't go to any other carrier or save issue) or 3) change your number.¬† You can also try contacting the FCC but that might not work either.¬†


Look up the following on Reddit: [Success story] It was Verizon's fault that MMS messages didn't reach a T-Mobile (and former Verizon) phone number. FCC forced them to fix it.

hi, i noticed that i am unable to receive messages from some people in group messages but can if we text individually. i have a Pixel 7. most people i do receive the texts from have Iphones but i'm having trouble with both Iphone and android users. i called ATT and the first rep told me to call verizon as thats where i just switched from 3 weeks ago. verizon can not help me as i no longer have any account with them. second rep told me to do a ""google account reset"" but that could affect my ability to text for up to 48 hours. i was told to call back after 48 hours if it still did not work. seems like these people dont really know what they're doing, just googling possible solution so i thought i would ask here rather than waste my time calling ATT over and over. thank you

I am having the SAME EXACT ISSUE with my Google Pixel 7. Can't get group texts from some people but can text individually. Left Verizon to come to AT&T less than a month ago. Tried everything discussed here. Talked to tech for 2 hours and couldn't resolve it. Assigned a case number but they can't respond for 4-5 days.

Well you are in this for the long haul. The issue stems from Verizon. It looks like when we left Verizon we had two mms profiles and they only deleted 1. Verizon will refuse to help you and if you can finally get att to help (took 2 months to get to the att office of the president) then you still have to wait because they have to make a case with Verizon.¬†

So options are 1) wait forever 2) return to Verizon (can't go to any other carrier or save issue) or 3) change your number.¬† You can also try contacting the FCC but that might not work either.¬†

"4Xgaming","t5_2sf8w","""Justice"" is my renaming of ""Efficiency"".  I had a fundamental objection to the original game's use of the concept, of a right wing captalist notion of efficient economies.  Or efficient governmental bureaucracies, which is frankly just lying about how people actually organize themselves.  ""Efficency"" was just SMAC's version of what was ""corruption and waste"" in Civ II.  I returned to those concepts, but instead called them ""Justice"".  I changed various factions and social engineering table entries around to reflect who was more just, and who was more cruel.  For instance, a Police State is *not* just.

The practical effect of low to negative Justice is that you get more drone riots in your cities.  In my social engineering table I made it hard to get a lot of Justice, so that you do have to make tradeoffs about whether you want more of that or not.  To be honest though, it's not that difficult to make people happy by other means.  Just build more happiness buildings like Recreation Commons etc.  Or put more of your budget into Psych, instead of Econ or Labs.

The other effect of Justice is economic.  If you have a large empire, increases in Justice can make you substantially more money than you'd expect, because otherwise a lot of stuff going to corruption / waste / kleptocracy.  Civ II had the idea that you could have Democracy and that *that* would make your society totally corruption free!  Ridiculous.  SMAC thankfully was more realistic than that.  Things are always less corrupt around your capitol, and things get worse the farther and farther away you get.  Conquered cities that are very far away, may contribute very little economically or scientifically to your empire, no matter how many nice shiny facilities you put in them.

One reason you may not notice these large empire, distant city effects so much in a real game, is that the core of your empire is probably what's gonna be making you the most money, research, and productivity anyways.  So if the periphery of newly conquered stuff is corrupt, well who cares?   Also by the time you get that far into conquering the map, the game will be over pretty soon anyways.  I'm not surprised if you didn't end up caring about Justice *that* much in the real world.

I think the time when Justice seems to matter the most, is in early midgame, if you've been eXpanding a whole lot.  You'll have all kinds of drone riots due to Bureaucracy, a term specific to SMAC, but also appearing in other early Civ games.  More Justice will alleviate that problem, although you can't make it totally go away.

Your other questions, I think I'll answer in other comments, because this one has gotten so long.",1711929619.0

- Do not work with anyone who did not comment publicly on your request. If anyone contacts you privately about your request, simply ignore them. If you have a request for which you do not want to post the image(s) to be edited publicly, please provide as much detail as possible about the request and ask that interested editors reply to your post. From there, you can vet the editors who reply by viewing their comment histories and reach out privately to whomever you'd like to work with. Again, **do not respond to any direct private messages about your request.**

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

Also I lowkey got the vibe that Fionna was a different age from finn or maybe had a different age gap w gumball and Marshall as Finn did with Bonnie and Marcy bc the girls would tell Finn they were too old for him but it seemed acceptable for gumball to be into Fionna that one episode where ice queen is pretending to be him (as well as Fionna realizing she doesn‚Äôt feel that way about gumball) and Marshall is always flirting w her which is different from teasing imo and esp the difference in how Fionna shuts down Marshall when he tries to ‚Äúprank‚Äù her and w all the flirting vs how Finn reacts to Marcy teasing him¬†

Idr when those episodes aired/took place in comparison to Finn and Jake‚Äôs time so if Finn and fionna‚Äôs ages lined up, maybe if they took place in a later season ie when they‚Äôre 17 but I feel they were a lot earlier on

As some of the other comments say, she‚Äôs technically not a Finn variant: she‚Äôs more of an unofficial one as her world is technically prismo‚Äôs adventure time fanfiction au so she‚Äôs not necessarily going to be exactly the same ie she still has both her arms (it‚Äôd be lowkey funny if she ended up losing the opposite arm as Finn or w leg instead or sth tho lol)",1711929620.0

As someone who grew up in a small community dominated by Christianity, I can state with full confidence a theistic centric society is not a positive thing.  It is no different than autocracy, with the added disadvantage of everyone needing to follow a 2000 year old book which cannot change with modern learnings.

You do you.  Everyone needs to follow their own path but it took me years to break free of the religion based small town cultism and I'm not going back.  It is n't the panacea you seem to believe.

I could say the same for Sith Inquisitor and Warrior stories.

"UkrainianConflict","t5_30hhs",">She has installed laws

The law you are talking about is in the draft state, nobody installed that law. The draft is from Faeser's ministry, but it is still discussed and it is indeed partially disputed, also inside the government and government coalition.

A minister cannot install laws, laws are made by the legislature, the parliament, not the executive - we are not some kind of electoral dictatorship. The government can bring a draft to parliament to debate it there and have a vote on it, as e.g. also any group of parliamentarians, which represent at least 5% of the parliament, can.

>to allow funding for left to left-extremist NGOs

It would allow - in the current state of the draft, to support NGOs which counter extremism, support democracy, help brainwashed people to normalize again and leave extremist and conspiracy circles, longer term and would give them more planning security. Most of those NGOs in question are already getting funds and also got them from conservative lead governments in the past. And it is not limited to right wing extremism and right wing illiberalism, those are just currently the biggest problem for democracy, and thus mentioned more often - e.g. with a party like the AfD, which is completely radical far right, partially extremist far right, gaining influence. The influence of left-wing extremism, like it is e.g. found in the DKP, the German Communist Party, is close to zero. Those pose no danger to democracy or democratic institutions at all.

>left to left-wing extremism

As many of the probably funded groups (those will be decided on later, as before also, it is not part of the draft, which particular groups will be funded) are ones countering extremism, and illiberalism and anti-democratic tendencies, currently in particular from the far right, as there are currently the biggest problem, many tend to be a bit on the liberal, left side. Few could be considered radical, none extremist.

>In fact, the NGOs will ofc be in favor of her SPD and everyone who disagrees is a Nazi!

First you call them left wing extremist and then you say they would favor the SPD, a moderate social democratic party, which is just center-left, not even a left wing party at all anymore? That's quite absurd. Actual far left or even left wing extremist groups, would support the very left parts of the party ""Die Linke"" or more likely the DKP, the German Communist Party.

>everyone who disagrees is a Nazi!

This term is often thrown around a bit too much indeed. Those people are often not ""literally"" Nazis, ""just"" despicable far-right radicals or extremists, which despise the liberal constitution of our country, despise its values, despise equal human rights, have an ethnic, V√∂lkisch, racist idea of Nations and despise the liberal modernity / the West in general. If people call those Nazis in everyday language - well, that is not 100% correct, but it is also not that false in most cases, that it poses a significant problem. 

In by far most of those cases, people who are called so, are in the so called ""representational gap"" (""Repr√§sentationsl√ºcke""), the fathers and mothers of our constitution intentionally installed in our constitution, and which we prefer to have in Germany. We don't want people who despise human rights, who want to install an authoritarian state, who hate people based onto their ethnicity, race, religion and so forth and want to persectute them based on that, in our parliaments as political representatives anymore. 

And it was a deliberate decision to do so - and you probably know the historical reasoning for that. If you wish to vote for such parties, it is possible that Germany will not allow you to do so. If you are an extremist, who e.g. hates people based on their race, you might be out of luck, if you want to vote for political representation of that filth in the parliaments Germany, as such parties can e.g. be banned.

Germany is a fortified/defensive Democracy, the political system is not tolerant against the enemies of liberty and democracy.

To quote Carlo Schmid from his 1948 speech:

_Now the question arises: should this equality and freedom be completely unrestricted and absolute, should it also be granted to those whose sole aim is to eradicate freedom itself after seizing power? In other words, should we continue to behave in future in the same way as we behaved towards the National Socialists during the Weimar Republic, for example? This question will also have to be discussed and decided in this House._ 

__For my part, I am of the opinion that it is not part of the concept of democracy that it itself creates the conditions for its elimination. Yes, I would like to go further. I would like to say that democracy is only more than a product of mere expediency where one has the courage to believe in it as something necessary for human dignity. But if one has this courage, then one must also have the courage to be intolerant towards those who want to use democracy to kill it.__

"boston","t5_2qh3r","Are you sure you had ""the money"" bank in your account, or did you just have a provisional credit? I'm fairly certain you're confusing ""available balance"" with ""my money"" when what's really happening is Chase giving you a provisional credit while they research your dispute. And one of the problems with Chase is they're known to be a less reliable bank in those kinds of disputes (more likely to find the charge ""real"", even in cases of what would appear to be clear fraud) and less likely to accept disputes to their decisions than a more consumer friendly bank...because you're a nothing, not even a rounding error, to them. So while they'll probably find in your favor, it doesn't sound like a particularly complicated fraud, that's not exactly noteworthy. It just becomes noteworthy when something goes wrong and you're faced with trying to pry your money (plus whatever charges they've added on top) from a half trillion dollar company instead of dealing with John the banker who has been in charge of your account the entire time it's been at the bank.

>Most of us want children to wait for a myriad of reasons, myself mainly because a child's body and brain is still developing and some of these surgeries and drugs are non-reversible.

Permanent treatments are not available to children. Puberty blockers are the most ""extreme"" thing kids get and those are designed to be reversible.

However, for many cuckold couples their ideal bull is someone who's needs are on-par with a one-night stand pickup, just a woman they can use for sex without commitment because she already has a husband to provide her that.  The couple is just using him for sex because the bulls is also just using her for sex.  There's nothing wrong with bull relationships OR bull casuals as long as everyone is honest about what they want out of it and agree to it without manipulation.",1711929624.0
"gaming","t5_2qh03","It's got similarities to the fighting genre. Each weapon has a different moveset and the game only teaches you the basics. From there you learn that your slash-slash-power slash-cool slash can skip a slash or two to go right into the cool slash. You also have armor that doesn't just give you defense but also passive bonuses that can synergize with your weapon and sometimes your weapon has some stuff as well that may be a plus like a status effect or an element.

So part of the fun is mastering the weapon and finding what goes well with it to make hunting easier. The other part is learning a monsters moveset and weaknesses to then use all your skills and items to defeat it. Most of the fun when I try farming for stuff is trying to beat my time. Also something I really like is that when you destroy a part of a monster, it not only makes the fight easier (most of the time) but also increases your chances of getting something from that part.

There's more, but it's pretty deep. The only thing I can think of adding in is that some randomness in the hunts can create some interesting situations.",1711929624.0

Most hospitals aren‚Äôt governed by idiots, they understand that 90% of people don‚Äôt have thousands upon thousands of dollars laying around to pay surprise medical bills.

So first course of action: Demand an itemized bill of every single thing they charged for. If they can‚Äôt justify a charge or explain a charge, they have to take it off and you must demand they do so.

Next, resubmit that NEW bill to the insurance and demand they pay all of it, they won‚Äôt, so you employ the next tactic.

Second Step: Demand a written explanation of your benefits and a formal review of the bill against your coverage. Make them detail every single thing they won‚Äôt pay for and demand an explanation. They will ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a few things they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt notice before‚Äù.

Take that now even lower bill back to the hospital and offer them a FRACTION of what the actual bill is.

Now REMEMBER.

Hospitals pay less for everything than we do as they buy supplies and equipment in RIDICULOUS bulk. A single tablet of Advil wholesale to us might work out to be 5-10 cents per capsule, hospitals pay a fraction of a penny per pill.

They have been made MORE than whole by whatever percentage of your bill your insurance company agreed to pay because their actual COST is a pittance compared to what they charge. 

So you aren‚Äôt costing the hospital a dime, and they would rather get something extra than nothing extra. If you make it clear to all involved that you won‚Äôt just complacently come off 100K, they will understand it‚Äôs not worth the hassle and they WILL negotiate with you.",1711929624.0

"uberdrivers","t5_2yzxz","When I started in my market, the average was $14.50 an hour. I was making triple that. For the last couple years, rather than 45 bucks an hour, I've averaged about $33.50. My market is now about $20 an hour and the collectivists are probably pleased because it really doesn't matter if you know what you're doing or not because if you make on any particular sequence more than $20 an hour they just clawed back by not paying you as much on the next series of rides.

By tonight I will have done 160 rides hit twi 80 trip quests and multiple so-called boost areas that paid supposedly various amounts I'm sitting on right now 292.50 in promotions which brought my take from $20 an hour to 23. I'm protecting that I will hit about maybe $1,300 on those 160 rides. I'm working on a $70 promotion with 18 more rides.  That works out to about $8 an hour on a holiday weekend with multiple searches and multiple boosts.

When they altered incentives for drivers like myself that are good at hitting the multi-trip quests I quit driving for them so I'm currently under a $2260 income guarantee which is the only reason that I'm even driving for Uber right now. 

Uber's business model is based on desperate people just trying to make a little extra money to pay that light bill. It's not sustainable, though, without professional drivers such as myself picking up the slack on the rides no one else wants. 

In the last 6 years I've seen multiple times where Uber has tried to rearrange the deck chairs and have removed incentives and reduced pay and all that however happens is people just look at how much they're making just as you did and stop driving and eventually they have to throw money at the problem because that's the only way you're going to get people to drive.

Uber's prices were always predatory pricing that are unsustainable to put four wheels on the ground and pick up a passenger and that doesn't matter even if you did do it with a robot it still cost for gas oil tires maintenance and depreciation and insurance",1711929625.0

So my procedure usually is to not touch the fics of the fandoms I write for until I am done with my own fics. I just want to keep my ""pure"" view from canon for my fics.

I would say it depends on yourself. 

Do you like your view on the characters? Just go for it. The Canon usually is the reason why we love a fandom. 

Do you want inspiration from others? Then read works from other people. But I would suggest to read a couple of works so you have a wider range of what you liked from the interpretation of others and can combine the best of it.",1711929625.0

"findomsupportgroup","t5_6pdj2c","Assuming you don't have another account, all the pictures of you on this profile are posted to the profile instead of a subreddit. You're getting no traction. Go to the reddit search bad, type in key words like paypig, finsub, findom, ect and find subreddits that let you advertise. Just be sure to read the rules of the subreddit first. Once you've posted to a subreddit, you can actually see the analytics of a post by  viewing it on your profile to figure out what pictures are getting seen the most based on when and where you're posting them.  


Unrelated to your ask, I think you may also want to redo your verification. You talk about a twitter with a similar but different username than your reddit and no mention of your reddit. Meaning that a catfish could have seen that video on twitter, saved it, and uploaded it to reddit on an account with a similar name. To do a solid verification, you want to say the name of the platform you're on, the username of the profile you're posting it on, and the date it's being posted on. That makes it so people can't scrape the video to catfish as you. You can also pin that to the top of your profile, so people can quickly and easily verify you and trust you. There's also no form of age verification or socials on your profile. Those are red flags that are going to turn away a lot of finsubs even when you start getting traffic to your profile.",1711929627.0

As to why he'd continue doing crack? Well, I've never done it, but I have done far more drugs than any sane person should do. Drugs with a faster route of administration typically ""hit"" far harder and feel much stronger.

To be honest I've done my fair share of nose candy, and I could take it or leave it. Maybe it's just because I started with Adderall far earlier, but I'd 100% take Adderall over Coke.

"AutismTranslated","t5_zlszm","I get visual snow but it's always attached to my ocular migraines (snow is a common symptom at the beginning of a visual migraine). I had only bouts of the snow for some time before having a severe visual migraine that caused me complete blindness for about 30 seconds, in the middle of a sunny day. It really freaked me out and was at a time of acute trauma and stress, which I think was the cause. Visual migraines are not meant, or even said, to cause blindness but mine did, briefly.

Since then I had more when acutely stressed, usually in an emergency situation such as when my house was flooding or when there was a fire over the road threatening homes on my street. I recall another at the post office I hate when trying to collect my mail. For me they always start with snow, then auras and progress to tunnel vision. I had no pain associated for many years but eventually got a headache with them (completely unlike the pain from stereotypical migraines).

Visual migraines are thought to be caused by an electrical wave travelling across the back of the brain. I mention this because it sounds like it might all be connected, and since our brains are very different it would make sense that we experience more anomalies.",1711929628.0

I used to think that so long as religious people kept it to themselves then I didn't care. But I do still care. Full belief by adult human beings in something that is so clearly made up by other people feels like a serious mental problem. I'm good with fantasy and people enjoying their lives. But there is a limit. I selfishly want people to understand their god was created by other people.

And of course there are major downsides top religion in general. I would argue a huge percentage of the conflicts throughout history are in some was religious-based.

I really don't think this woman did anything wrong (except maybe the initial offense of which we have no video evidence).

It's not required to carry ID, so the cop telling her to go back and get her ID is not a legal command, she is under no obligation to show him her ID.

If the cop was doing things properly, he should have asked her to identify herself, which he never did, he just ordered her away to get her ID.  The law only requires you to give you name and DOB (and perhaps some other info based on the state law), not to show a physical ID.  The cop can take you to the police station until they can positively identify you if he doesn't believe you are who you say you are, but there is no law that says you have to carry ID on you at all times and show it to the police when they order you to.",1711929628.0

A. When I say I ‚Äúseparate‚Äù the show and my beliefs, I do not mean that I disregard my beliefs in any context. I meant to say that I view the show as completely fictional, and not an influence over my core beliefs. It‚Äôs entertainment, and, while it has its lessons like any other show, it‚Äôs not something I take seriously. I try to be careful about keeping my religious self unaffected by external media like shows, especially if the shows reference religion in a very unorthodox way like Hazbin does.

B. I recognize that the show does not reflect my true beliefs about Heaven, Hell, Satan, and God. I do not think, though, that watching the show is an act of blasphemy. It is no different from, for example, reading a book that contains witchcraft, **as long as** my beliefs remain steadfast. It‚Äôs non-real fiction like any other work of fantasy, and I am a consumer of it. It has nothing to do with the reality I live in and read about in the Bible, apart from the fact that some of the characters are based on real beings. 

As for my opinions on Hazbin‚Äôs possible portrayal of God or Jesus, I think that portraying them in the show would bother me a little. My view of God is a God that is pure and loving, and **IF** a portrayal of God is one that is any less than that, I would feel personally bothered. That is not to say that Viv **would** portray God in a negative light, but if I do feel uncomfortable by the show, it would be my decision to stop watching. My line hasn‚Äôt been crossed yet, and if it is crossed, my beliefs about God are worth more than what a TV show presents to me. 

Once again, this is what *I* believe, and I don‚Äôt wish to argue or attack. I hope this helps clarify!",1711929629.0

‚ÄúWe accept mysteries we cannot hope to know‚Äù or something like that is the phrase‚Ä¶ whereas the west scholastics/academia and I suppose imagination could be the other leg of trying to *know* things.¬†

As the other commenter said, repeating the Jesus prayer isn‚Äôt about emptying the mind either.¬†

One thing that might be similar to that though is moving into the heart for prayer. Not something that can be described definitively not by me, and something I don‚Äôt do well or often. Moving your attention to your heart during prayer might be one way to think about it.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3",">pigs are far and away the calorie-in-to-out winners overall, and they are omnivores who could historically eat slop including rotten food that would otherwise be thrown away). However, they lose to sheep when there is open land for labor and feeding reasons.

It's a little more complicated than that.  Pigs were very frequently left unpenned because they were, and are, excellent foragers.  Pigs can support themselves perfectly well in a European or North American forest, where a sheep would struggle to find sufficient grazing plants.  By contrast, pigs have more difficulty subsisting on grass or in semi-desert conditions, as would be encountered in classic sheep-grazing lands like the Eurasian steppe or Arabia and the Levant.  Most pigs cannot live on grass alone; as far as I know only the kunekune breed is a true grazer.   

During the initial European colonization of North America, pigs were the most popular source of animal protein.  Not because they could be kept in densely packed pens to be fed on harvested grains, but rather because they could be let loose to forage unsupervised in nearby forests, and their numbers would increase exponentially in the absence of natural predators:

>The documented pig population expanded dramatically with the settlement of Massachusetts Bay. In 1634 William Wood stated that the number of pigs in Massachusetts was ""innumerable"" and in 1636 the General Court of that colony complained of ""divers strange swine"" and required all pigs to be marked (Trumbull 1850:1; Wood 1635:69). In 1644 a Connecticut statute made similar complaints and also required marking. Apparently, this had little effect, for the next year Connecticut distinguished between swine ""keept att home"" and swine ""keept by herd in the  woods"" requiring that the former be ringed or yoked.  It seems possible that pigs, once established in the eastern 
woodland, multiplied beyond any expectation or control.

-I left my kitchen job which was probably the most demanding job I've ever had on one of the most demanding days of the year

-Buddy wants to drink some beer, I so pick up a 6-pack of Lagunitas Maximus and we go chill with some girls on campus. We kill the 6-pack.

-Girls say there is a dude like 3 blocks away where my buddy could score some coke, so we walk there.

-Meet homie, he offers us some free lines. We take them. He also offers me a tab since I mentioned having not so great acid where I'm at in the college town. I just take it.

-I crush another beer and we get another friend to drive me back to my house for clothes and stuff.

-He has DMT... I am feeling the acid pretty hard through the coke and get basically railroaded into smoked a very big hit of DMT out of a cleaned out lightbulb on my back porch. I see the most vivid hallucinations of my entire life filled with a bunch of Ancient Egyptian iconography and basically predicting my own death. Literally gripped my buddy as tight as I could and held on until it all calmed down.

-Another buddy shows up. ""Yo can you drive me to my grandpas house? He has liquor to drink (he knew we would drink it). Can I get a ride?""

-At my grandpas house I find a dead opossum that my grandpas dog has gored. I sat in the car freaking out for about half an hour before I mustered up enough courage to pick it up by its tail and drop it in his dumpster. 

-Put the possum in the trash and continue to be fucked up out of my mind for most of the night and even just lay in his yard in the morning to watch the sunrise. 

-I go check the trashcan in the morning and this possum was definitely pregnant. There were like 8 baby possums in this trash can covered in blood and viscera. I threw up all over the babies and then fainted and passed out on the pavement at like 6:30 am. 

-Woke back up with puke on my shirt, went inside to change clothes and then called animal control. I left before they got there. 

That is all. One of the craziest nights of my life. Haha

Even though several huge meteors have hit Earth in it's past, they were spread out  over hundreds of millions of year. That is an incomprehensible timespan to our human brains so it all gets compressed to ""the past"". They're rare, but if you multiply rare by a long time, eventually it will happen.

"balkans_irl","t5_n458w","Dear Unflaired,

You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.

The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.

When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.

No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.

I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.

You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.

You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.

Even this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.

Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.

In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.

You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.

It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.",1711929630.0

IIHS says that there are too little data to give a good estimate for the X3M, but the normal X3 (not that slow!) does about 40% fewer ""Bodily Injury"" claims compared to the Accord. 

Going by the data, the single most dangerous cars to other road users is the Chevy Mallibu, followed by the Ford Mustang. Both rack up twice as much ""Bodily Injury"" payments as the F-150, and about three times more than a X3 or Model Y, who are in the same ballpark.

Either way it would be interesting biologically and in general life. BUT still not worth the target that you put on your own chest. I have no desire to make my life ridiculously difficult, if I can choose not to.

estrogen is self explenotary and I gladly pass. thank you but no thank you.

no more body and facial hair... why? I'm not a onlyfans whore and I don't plan to become one. so again thanks but I pass.

20 dollars is 20 dollars and if I can't find 3 useful ones, then I take the 20 dollars.

people who you find attractive find you attractive... this is a dream come true and a no brainer in my book. Definitely taking this one. So one down only one or two to go.

you become a master pizza chef. honestly, probably the better version of 20 dollars. I like pizza and to be able to make great pizza yourself? saves money, is healthier and you can always serf your favorite. Plus it's a nice surprise for friends, if you don't plan to open a pizzarua, which I don't.

water tastes and feels like your favorite drink... sounds cool on the surface but honestly it just means there is one drink less in the world that I can enjoy and it's a great one too. definitely pass

you can talk to cats is a really niche skill. Like cats do understand their names and will actively ignore you, what makes you think they would want to have a conversation with you at all? On top of that they don't just gain human inteligence, so imagine the stupidest people you know but likely roughly as smart as toddlers. You won't have a meaningful conversation with them, sorry to burst your buddle dreams. That being said, there are cities littered with cats and the possibility is good that they know almost anything that's going on, so if a toddler can tell you what you are searching for, so can they. definitely nice for certain travels and so I take this. best restaurants in town, here I come!
2 down 1 to go.

you don't have to sleep, if it's meant as written then this is a no brainer. Not having to sleep but still be able to sleep is the best of both worlds, your not missing out on sleep and can skip boring night and you can cash in on extra time over night if you want or need to, for a project or something. On the other hand, if it means that I can't sleep anymore, I would consider the master pizza chef one.

TL;DR: people who you find attractive, find you attractive, talking to cats and don't have to sleep no more or master pizza chef, if the other one prevents me from sleeping.",1711929632.0

Only those who did not transfer their crypto in kind distribution themselves within that 30 days window got a check. 

Losing 70% and frozen accounts have nothing to do with what we are talking about here. You said USDC were not returned in kind, I said it was explaining what **in kind** means. You said that you did not get any USDC back, that means you yourself did not transfer your 35% of USDC when you were given that 30 days window to do so.

The county job? That was a sure thing. He was the boss. I am sure he had things like a pension and healthcare. He could have retired there. 

The decision itself was motivated by short-term financial gain with a ""big job"" he was offered. That ""big job"" ended, and now what? He is a dry waller again and living with the uncertainty that construction work can bring. 

It was so deluded and short sighted it actually made me upset. It is why the family was always one step behind.

"BarOwners","t5_9d2i5","As an owner-operator, I always delegate ordering, scheduling, and inventory. I set up the systems, review the numbers and reports, and come up with an action plan to address any issues. But I don't personally count the bottles or schedule the shifts.

At a really small place the owner might also act as bar manager, but if you have enough cash flow to afford it it almost always makes sense to pay someone else. There's enough other stuff to worry about without spending time on those tasks, and they're things you can teach pretty much anyone who is trustworthy and willing to learn.

As far as how owners get paid, there are a thousand variations but they all reduce down to a few flavors. If there is a full time manager, the owner should probably not be drawing a salary as well. If the owner is the manager, they should be paying themselves, but in those cases money is usually tight so they often don't, or defer the pay. Owners and investors should both get profit distributions. This aligns their incentives and ensures that owners aren't dipping into the cash flow ahead of inevstors. An owner-operator usually puts in work for a  stake in the business, as opposed to putting in cash. The exact value of this tradeoff should be negotiated ahead of time and specified in an operating agreement or articles of incorporation or similar document.

Owner taking a percentage of sales seems a little strange, since it ignores costs. The bar could be operating at a loss but they would still take money out. Sounds like a good way to end up with angry investors.",1711929635.0

"BatmanBeyond","t5_2uuq4","Spellbinder without a doubt .

The snake cult also was just twisted they weren't particularly morally malicous just very misguided . 

The only guys who  in terms of being evil stand out are Spellbinder ,Big Time , and Shreik.

I think Shriek however is fairly reasonable as his soul motivation after his first appearance is revenge , but Big Time, and Spellbinder on the other hand are pretty evil. 

Spellbinder for the reasons you mention , but I think Big Time is just as bad if not potentially worse .

He manipulates friends , he hurts the innocent , and just like Spellbinder has no empathy. The major difference I see is the difference in their criminal mind as I think Spellbinder doesn't particularly care for murdering his targets , but Big Time seemed pretty ok with the idea of killing.",1711929635.0

In a more rigid sense in the Christian context of what it means to believe, belief is the same as faith in the Greek of the New Testament and faith is trust. To believe is to trust, and to trust Christ is to give yourself over to him completely. Mind, body, and soul. To ""have been crucified with Christ; so it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."" When you've reached that point you'll be a saint.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n",">Well in a world where you can magically become what you feel, then they're right. Trans people don't exist. Because they are just the gender they wanted to be. 

I think this is a misunderstanding of the objection. 

I don't think every book or world has to have an answer for everything, and ""well, it mostly happens off-screen and everyone is broadly accepting"" seems to have been the intent, which is perfectly fine in my book. 

But if you spend 28 years living the life of a cis woman, and then decide you've had enough and get a transformation spell on to ""become a man""... You are in a situation. Everyone who knew you knew you as a woman before. If there are any sort of gender roles in this world, you now have to adapt to work with them differently. If people learn you were once living as a woman, that may affect how they see you. 

It might have consequences for inheritance law, it might have consequences for magic reasons, etc. 

> You're judging a concept that exists in our world because we lack a way to facilitate that end, since we lack magic.... into a world that does have that.

You're operating under the assumption that a perfect physical transition is the only real barrier, when a great many of the barriers (or *enabling factors*) are social or political. Not just in the sense of ""bigotry"", but like, if you have to give birth to be able to do necromancy for example. People would simply not expect a man to be able to do necromancy in that environment. 

I don't think that lacking any notable thing there is ""boring"". A genuinely gender-abolitionist society would be cool to see.

The main issue is that between 12th, 13th and 14th gen is that there isn't too much improvement other than minimal speed increases. The main improvements come with new sockets.

I played DD1 much the same way.  All Fromsoft games too for that matter.  For the gameplay, not the story.  I still remember how the story went in the first game so I never expected the story to be good and bought it with that understanding.  I play entirely for the combat and gameplay, so I'm happy enough.

There'll probably be a DLC like Bitterblack Isle at some point too.  Capcom won't miss the chance to take more money.  But I'm fine with that.

‚ÄòAnd they all feel this way?‚Äô
‚Äò""Try talking to a Krieg Guardsman some time. You‚Äôll find he has no hopes, nodreams, no desires, nothing but his orders and the prospect of a violent end. As faras he is concerned, there is nothing else. He is a dead man walking.------
------- That‚Äôs the other reason why the Death Korps of Krieg needs
people like us: because sometimes, just sometimes, they need to be stopped from going too far‚Äù

When a governor general of a planet besieged by necrons is conversing with a Krieger:

‚ÄòThis space port and its environs, GeneralHanrik, are packed with able-bodied refugees, bereft of purpose. Whateverfunctions those people once had in your society, they can no longer serve them.‚Äô
‚ÄòBut how‚Ä¶? We just don‚Äôt have the equipment to outfit them. Ours has alwaysbeen a peaceful world, colonel, we have never had need of a substantial armedforce.‚Äô
‚ÄòYou agreed,‚Äô said the colonel, ‚Äòthat your people are a resource, and we mustsurely utilise all the resources at our disposal. They are loyal subjects of theEmperor?‚Äô
‚ÄòOf course. Of course they are loyal, but‚Äì‚Äô
‚ÄòThen they will be pleased to offer their lives to Him.

When the results of that discussion pan out,

‚ÄòCannon fodder!‚Äô Hanrik burst out. ‚ÄòYou used my men as cannon fodder, putthem on the front lines to be slaughtered. I‚Äôve been listening to the reports, andthey‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a massacre out there!‚Äô

‚ÄòThey are soldiers, General Hanrik. They knew what to expect.‚Äô

‚ÄòBut they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ So many of them, the majority of them, they only just‚Ä¶ Theyonly had three weeks to train. Even the experienced ones among them, they haven‚Äôtfaced anything like this before, and they‚Äôre under-equipped‚Ä¶

The colonel turned then, to regard Hanrik blankly through the eyepieces of hisgasmask. ‚ÄòThat,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòis precisely why their value is limited.‚Äô

            The mods of INAT are very busy with a large number of modmail, the fastest way to get your post live,

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","The other day, I had the idea of building my own 60% hot swappable mechanical keyboard (specifically a creamy one) and did some research. I'm quite a noob to keyboards in general and this would be my first build, but I'm kinda stuck. My maximum budget total would probably be \~$120, but I would prefer a range around \~$100. I need help deciding on what I should buy because I'm really new to this stuff.

My choice for switches is the [Akko Cream Blues](https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Switch-Dustproof-Mechanical-Tactile-Switches/dp/B0C3H7PR1Z/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=akko%2Bcream%2Bblue&th=1) for switches, as they're creamy and somewhat pre-lubed (or at least it says the coil is lubed idk). The only problem I have is that the only option for the amount of switches you get is 45 pcs, could anyone find decently cheap deep creamy pre-lubed switches?

For keycaps I am deciding between a few. My main choice is probably the [IOAOI PBT Cyan Purple](https://www.amazon.com/IOAOI-Keycaps-Switches-Mechanical-Keyboards/dp/B08Y7WB3VK/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=taro%2Bpurple%2Bkeycaps&th=1)s (I am going for light blue or purple so if you have any ideas that look better lmk), but I am also on the fence of whether or not I should buy mac layout keycaps (I use a macbook), either [individually](https://www.amazon.com/Godspeed-Profile-Keycaps-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B08CKMDQ9W/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=mechanical%2Bkeycaps%2Bmac&th=1) or [as the full keycap set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPSPP8TD/ref=twister_B08Y6PPZB7?_encoding=UTF8&th=1), but keycaps are not my main worry. 

The PCB is where things get complicated. I was originally thinking of buying a PCB by itself, but soon realized it is a lot cheaper and easier to buy either a DIY keyboard kit (basically just a keyboard without the switches or keycaps) or a hot swappable mechanical keyboard and just take off the keycaps and switches. 

I am now leaning towards the second option, as it is a lot cheaper. My main choice would be the [ASCENY GK61](https://www.amazon.com/Asceny-One-Mechanical-Keyboard-Gateron/dp/B07PVDJXZ8/ref=slsr_d_dpds_fsdp4star_fa_xcat_cheapdynam_d_sccl_2_4/130-4085822-8738656?th=1), because it is very cheap and hot swappable, but would people recommend getting more high quality keyboards to use as the base? I always see people using very high quality keyboards as the board that they take apart, but how big is the difference between the PCBs on a high quality keyboard as opposed to a 20 dollar one? 

I might end up raising the budget a bit more and making everything more high quality if there is too much of a difference, because I would rather have a good keyboard for a bit more money than a meh keyboard to save some money.

I'm not really worrying about stabilizers right now, because they would come with the keyboard and if they're really that bad I'll get some different ones.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully you'll be able to help me!",1711929639.0

Um, actually, I wasn't explaining your point back to you. I think you misunderstood me, I was disagreeing with this statement of yours:

>I point to the divorcing of metaphysics is where science lost it's soul for this quasi-religion it is today.

I don't think science has ""lost its soul"" to become a quasi-religion. I was arguing the long and tired history of people using science as a tool to further empower their own religion, thus the quasi-nature of science has literally always been there. And the fact that more science is being done in institutions that have tried their best to detangle religious notions from the results of tests mean that it's actually Less quasi-religious than it ever has been. Science has become far more clinical than it ever has been especially in national labs and international projects. 

If the concept of science loosing its soul is what I think you mean. I interpreted this as the general public using science as a religion. Which I'm fine with sure. But that's just pop science. That's the media, not science for sciences' sake.",1711929640.0

"furry_irl","t5_3b66u","As a group? No, you might as well say stop sexualizing librarians or whatever. The concept of 'librarians' doesn't deserve protection, the concept of 'nuns' even less so. If people were directly sexualizing an individual real-person who didn't want it, that would be bad, but whole groups can't claim protection of their entire concept from satire or disrespect.  

In fact, its especially appropriate to sexualize nuns as a concept, since the practice is historically oppressive and misogynistic. Convent's are historically one of the ways the catholic church dealt with women who weren't sufficiently obedient to society (**especially** if they engaged in sex outside of marriage). Forcing women into convents against their will where they were separated from all men and brutally punished for any disobedience, was a way to take away a variety of types of agency from women, including their sexual freedom. Satirizing the concept of nuns sexually is a natural and worthy response to this in my opinion.",1711929640.0

"newearthwisdom","t5_57rsy3","This is my definition and understanding.

The New Earth is a whole different way of being and how we interact with each other, our Earth Mother, our resources, and everything around us. It's shedding everything that the toxic system of oppression, patriarchy and colonization has taught us to be which is separate, unforgiving, power dynamics, silence, sexual abuse, master-slave mentality, and not living from our hearts. What we are currently experiencing is the oppressive way of being that is not true to ourselves and to how our ancestors lived.

The new paradigm is about unity, oneness, togetherness, seeing one another as brother and sisters and not as separate from each other, is honoring and respecting every living being (plant, animal, rock, Spirit, etc). It's living from our heart center and following our intuition rather than our logic and traumas. It's about honoring how our ancestors lived and commune with each other and bringing back their old ways while also making it our own way. It's healing from our generational traumas and bringing healing to our lineage and to our Earth Mother who has suffered so much at the hands of the colonizers. 

The new earth is only for those who are open in their heart chakra and are following Spirit. It's a completely new way of being that not many will resonate to but it will call out to those whose mission is to bring healing to the Earth Mother and to assist with the ascension process given their incarnation script.

I hope this answers your questions. Feel free to ask for any clarification :) Sending you much love and light in your journey.",1711929640.0

Qays-Yemen rivalry?

Does anyone know more about this rivalry or any sources for further info on this long lasting event. It seems very under appreciated in Islamic history. 

My understanding is that this rivalry:

* Led to the myth Yemenis are the original Arab
* Created the Adnan-Qahtan division 
* Allowed South Arabians to gain further 'Arabness' and become viewed as 'authentic' Arabs
* Contributed to the Abbasid revolution - Yemenis supported the Abbasid revolution
* Contributed to Sunni-Shia politics - Yemeni were Shia, Sunnis Qaysi

Hey! I read a story a long time ago (can‚Äôt remember the name) but it was basically Pok√©mon battles but with consequences for losing. I‚Äôd love to GM a roleplay for you where you start out as a trainer and have to battle your way through the entire journey!

I am thinking this would be like a D&D esque adventure, but with Pok√©mon battles. I want you to pick a starter Pok√©mon and we can work from there as you progress on your Journey! I prefer generations 1-4 to base this on, but I can study up on the newer games if needed! As a disclaimer, I plan on you winning and losing battles. Your character should be transformed by the experience (either physically or mentally) as they continue their journey to be a Pok√©mon master. Each battle will be a unique chance of something happening! (I can either simulate the battles on my end, or we can make it where we actually ‚Äúbattle‚Äù via roleplay!)

So, message me with what generation you want to play in, what starter you want, and what your favorite kinks are! 

My kinks include: humiliation, betrayal, collars, hypnosis, oral, commands, body writing, tattoos, and more!",1711929641.0

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","""He could have easily done that by making the wishes the normal way, at worst the way Milluki did, using other people.""

Having her treat him like a normal person for that wish would be horrendous in terms of what would happen. If nothing happened on any large scale after multiple wishes (which they would assume he had to do the favor for between) they would realize there was something off. 

----

With that part out of the way...yeah making them let him leave with her is better, he won't ever have to kill Illumi. Their family causes each other a lot of harm but neither has actually set out to ACTUALLY kill the other. Illumi also is smart enough to seduce if he can make wishes without consequences it's likely because she cares about him and has something to do with it and killing him would be a TERRIBLE idea of he wants to use her abilities for his own purposes. What Killua did was establish ""we are going to be allowed to live our life as siblings and she won't be a prisoner anymore"" and ultimately, the family has accepted it. 

----

The problem is EVENTUALLY she would ask a favor over the healing as far they understood things, the reason they were so against it was they understood that the consequences of that favor not only could be severe but could fall back onto the family per their understanding. It's not something he could have a random person take the request and only that person would die when they couldn't grant her insane request. There was no keeping it a secret post Gon being healed. Also while we don't see them constantly watching him they do have several moments that make it VERY clear they do watch from afar when they want. Also you say he didn't spend much time home but remember he did stop by quite a few times and even early on he made it VERY clear with (paraphrasing) ""I don't want to be an assassin I want to have fun with my friend."" By the standards of his family he is pretty soft when it comes to murder. Remember he even defends the whole assassin thing by pointing out innocent people don't usually get hired to be assassinated and still rejects being an assassin while having no qualms killing those that get in his way or harm those he cares about... He has too much of a heart to get a ton of innocent people killed and this is from what they know.",1711929641.0

I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.

The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.

Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.

You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.

If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.

You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.

The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.

I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.

When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.

My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.",1711929642.0

I understand you're trying to ""gotcha"" me here, but no person can come up with a solid idea on the spot. So let's move beyond that bullshit and be adults here.

I'm in no way saying don't try to protest for Palestine, definitely do in the ways that you think will be effective. But let's not play like we don't all know how humans are in large groups. A person is smart and empathetic, people are stupid and obstinate in groups. 

You are trying to argue with me when all I'm doing is pointing out human nature and how we act socially and psychologically. And that's... Kinda ridiculous. You can say it's stupid and bullshit, and you're right, it is. But it IS how it is.

At some point, the harder you fight against this sentiment, you will have to admit that you rather be angry than be effective.

At some point a rapport will need to be created and you can't do that in the midst of opening new wounds. What you define as an insult may be different than what they define as an insult, if you want to win hearts and minds you have to learn to speak to them in their language, understand what they value and then leverage that toward steering them to the goal you want.

> Can you tell me what exactly is there to like about any of our politicians? What are they doing right now that is in any way benefiting this country? I cant think of a single thing.

The‚Äôve only been back in Stormont for a few weeks so it‚Äôs a little premature to expect big results. I think MON and ELP have been setting a good example of getting on well that we need to see more of. But if you don‚Äôt like any of them then vote for someone else. I‚Äôm not trying to persuade you that our current crop of MLAs are any good. My point is that you deal with that at the ballot box, not by having someone other than the electorate who can kick MLAs out if they don‚Äôt mean some nebulous standard of ‚Äòperformance‚Äô that you‚Äôve never defined.",1711929644.0

"felinebehavior","t5_2ytzb","It's play aggression. Ie: He's bored and is strying to get you to play with him. The gesture everyone thinks  is him trying to ""mount you"" looks more like a fumbling and uncoordinated ""rabbit kick"" (a gesture done in play and fighting) to me.

Start playing with him at least once a day, every day. One play session should last at least 30 mins to 1 hour and the goal is to get him running hard enough to pant. Stop for a rest and then repeat this 2 more times. This mimics them hunting for prey 3 times, in which they stalk, chase and kill. For the best behavior results, feed him dinner directly after his playtime. This might also help him sleep through the night or at least not be as rambunctious for his first 2 years.",1711929644.0

Most GMs don't run Background count like that because:  


1. Even force 8 spells with 4 hits would lose 2 hits on a background count of 2.
2. It's a pain to calculate what background count exists where.  

3. Background count rules as written, a mage could be defeated by someone having emotional pain, which creates background count 6. This stack with existing background counts of -2, which would put any mage at -8 dice simply because someone started crying.  


And physical adepts wouldn't be able to use powers that have only 1 rank. Like astral perception. -1 background count being technically everywhere means no power beyond 1 rank will ever be able to activate unless thoroughly cleansed.  


So yeah. Your GM should not be running the game, or background count rules, like that. Using reagents to increase the limit is A LITTLE bit cheese, but you can only increase the limit to your magic rating.",1711929645.0

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","The other day, I had the idea of building my own 60% hot swappable mechanical keyboard (specifically a creamy one) and did some research. I'm quite a noob to keyboards in general and this would be my first build, but I'm kinda stuck. My maximum budget total would probably be \~$120, but I would prefer a range around \~$100. I need help deciding on what I should buy because I'm really new to this stuff.

My choice for switches is the [Akko Cream Blues](https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Switch-Dustproof-Mechanical-Tactile-Switches/dp/B0C3H7PR1Z/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=akko%2Bcream%2Bblue&th=1) for switches, as they're creamy and somewhat pre-lubed (or at least it says the coil is lubed idk). The only problem I have is that the only option for the amount of switches you get is 45 pcs, could anyone find decently cheap deep creamy pre-lubed switches?

For keycaps I am deciding between a few. My main choice is probably the [IOAOI PBT Cyan Purple](https://www.amazon.com/IOAOI-Keycaps-Switches-Mechanical-Keyboards/dp/B08Y7WB3VK/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=taro%2Bpurple%2Bkeycaps&th=1)s (I am going for light blue or purple so if you have any ideas that look better lmk), but I am also on the fence of whether or not I should buy mac layout keycaps (I use a macbook), either [individually](https://www.amazon.com/Godspeed-Profile-Keycaps-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B08CKMDQ9W/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=mechanical%2Bkeycaps%2Bmac&th=1) or [as the full keycap set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPSPP8TD/ref=twister_B08Y6PPZB7?_encoding=UTF8&th=1), but keycaps are not my main worry. 

The PCB is where things get complicated. I was originally thinking of buying a PCB by itself, but soon realized it is a lot cheaper and easier to buy either a DIY keyboard kit (basically just a keyboard without the switches or keycaps) or a hot swappable mechanical keyboard and just take off the keycaps and switches. 

I am now leaning towards the second option, as it is a lot cheaper. My main choice would be the [ASCENY GK61](https://www.amazon.com/Asceny-One-Mechanical-Keyboard-Gateron/dp/B07PVDJXZ8/ref=slsr_d_dpds_fsdp4star_fa_xcat_cheapdynam_d_sccl_2_4/130-4085822-8738656?th=1), because it is very cheap and hot swappable, but would people recommend getting more high quality keyboards to use as the base? I always see people using very high quality keyboards as the board that they take apart, but how big is the difference between the PCBs on a high quality keyboard as opposed to a 20 dollar one? 

I might end up raising the budget a bit more and making everything more high quality if there is too much of a difference, because I would rather have a good keyboard for a bit more money than a meh keyboard to save some money.

I'm not really worrying about stabilizers right now, because they would come with the keyboard and if they're really that bad I'll get some different ones.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully you'll be able to help me!",1711929645.0

"popculturechat","t5_5rj68d","I remember when the CW and ABC Family ruled YA television, haha! That was a golden era of TV for me.

When Riverdale ended, I saw some posts about how it's probably the last long-running teen drama with the 20+ episodes per season and I think they might've been correct. But even then, I think the comparison is just in format because I don't think Riverdale ever gave off the same feels as shows like Gilmore Girls, OTH, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries. 

Like those older shows are comfort shows to me because not every episode is a high stakes battle of some sort,  sometimes you just spent time with characters and their interpersonal drama. And there's a lot of episodes, so you really do get to know them. Yes, there might've been some crazy twists, and shows that were based in the supernatural are not totally real-life relatable but the characters themselves still were somehow? Idk. 

I've been (re)watching a lot of these shows lately and have been thinking about how it's so different now! They are still iconic and finding a new generation of viewers though, so good for their longevity! 

I haven't watched the CW since TVD ended in 2017, and by then, it was the only show I'd been watching after Hart of Dixie got canceled in 2015.",1711929645.0

1. Midoriya: Midoriya would likely see potential in Mikoe's abilities and her desire to prove her self-worth. He might also empathize with her struggles and want to help her overcome them.


2. Bakugo: Bakugo would probably find Mikoe's arrogance and stubbornness irritating, but he might respect her strength and determination in battle. He would likely challenge her to prove herself and push her limits.


3. Aizawa: Aizawa would likely be wary of Mikoe's volatile Quirk and her tendency to put herself in harm's way. He would emphasize the importance of controlling her abilities and staying focused in combat situations.


4. All Might: All Might would likely see potential in Mikoe's desire to help others, but he would also be concerned about her reckless behavior and the potential danger she poses to herself and others. He would encourage her to channel her powers for the greater good and become a responsible hero.


5. All For One: All For One might see Mikoe as a potential recruit due to her powerful Quirk and her willingness to use it for her own gain. He would likely try to manipulate her for his own purposes and exploit her insecurities.


6. Shigaraki: Shigaraki might see Mikoe as a chaotic force that could be useful for causing destruction and chaos. He would likely see her rebellious nature as an asset and might try to recruit her to join the League of Villains.


Overall, Mikoe's interactions with these characters would likely be complex, with each of them seeing different aspects of her personality and potential.",1711929647.0

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Yeah - it's in an awkward 'uncanny valley' atm...

I was playing a demo of a shooter game a month or so ago, and it required leaning and ducking etc... not too bad (although pretty harsh on my dodgy hip) - but you have to do it behind cover - but when you put your hand out to 'steady' yourself your hand just goes straight through it (at least I didn't try to actually lean on it :D)

Full-Dive VR anime would be a dream - but it also won't happen for decades yet (at best)... because it requires not feeding information to the brain via the existing senses (vision, feel, etc), but by sending data *directly* to the brain, bypassing the senses.

This allows you to 'feel' things that aren't there, and to do things you couldn't do in reality... not to mention 'solving' the issue of your eyes telling you you're moving, whilst your inner-ear says otherwise, and other sensory clashes... 

because whilst they're fairly vestigal, humans *do* have far more than the 5 'core' senses - and they complement each other and need to work in harmony to give 'real' immersion.

&nbsp;  
TL;DR: VR currently works best (imo) for slower-paced games that don't require too much 'hands on' interaction (if you can use a magic wand, gravity gun, or similar, to manipulate stuff, then it gets around the whole 'I can't feel what I'm holding' issue)... and that's definitely not a description for SC :p",1711929647.0

Another aspect is just the economy and poverty. Things are getting bad. In the last decade levels of poverty and deprivation have increased substantially.

The Christians who do that crap are as much part of our Christian family as the obligatory troubled cousin most families have. I wish they knew better than to be hurtful but they don't. 

Denying their role in the specifics AND overall theme denies the harm they have done to others and whilst you are right they are not preaching hate the sin, if it is one, not the sinner it's still pointless to pretend that either way they are still using the religion to harm others. And denying it is adding to the burden victims already have to deal with to come forward/heal. 

It's not ""they're not being true/typical."" It's ""Why is this typical for so many and what can I do to stop this and make victims lives easier?""

Mentioning the scripture helps no one who is not ready for it, too. And there is perhaps better ways you could have said your point without focusing so much on what is true Christianity or not. The trueness doesn't matter. _They have hurt people._",1711929648.0

- Second: **no one can predict whether or not you will purge!** If you don't currently have active acne, it's less likely but still possible.
- Third: If your purge lasts for longer than 12 weeks or seems really extreme, talk to your dermatologist! NO PURGE SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS - if you're still purging after 3 months, talk to your doctor or ask us for help!
- Lastly: We have a very [helpful wiki!](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRQmcAj-x5A8JIQygtW2Rg89uPsJPR5JLH_dLxLNCW4eazWW4i49bsrF0e2YYx10wx00ctaUnyvHfyD/pub) It contains lots of tips about starting out, including specific routine recommendations.

"DadsAndBoys","t5_rparc","Woah there bucko! Our stats show you either haven‚Äôt interacted enough in the community yet, or your karma level is too low. In order to maintain and preserve 
community engagement we must now ask that you take part in the subreddit a little more before you can submit a post. **PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THROUGH, THANK 
YOU**

In order to post here you will need **3+ comment karma** that is specific to this subreddit only. Some of the ways you earn this karma is by:

- Showing our members some love by **commenting** on their posts. Make as many comments as you can, this will get you there quicker. (We advise you not to ask for 
karma in these comments in the event that Reddit intervenes)
- Introducing yourself in our [monthly conversation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/1b3sdue/monthly_conversation_thread_march_say_hi/)
- Request a unique [custom user flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/14eg720/get_your_custom_user_flairs/)
- Taking part in our [Q&A thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/19caszw/qa_thread_say_hit_me_or_shoot_automod_will_ask/)

Many apologies, we hope you can bear with us through a [transitional period](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsAndBoys/comments/1bsjlsl/apologies_due_to_an_unmanageable_amount_of_daily/). While initially we were able to help out with your karma goal 
by upvoting your comments, it's become incredibly difficult for moderators to keep up with requests. So for the time being unfortunately you will have to wait until 
you have reached the karma goal yourself. There is no telling how long this will take, but the more you comment the higher the chance you will reach it. You will be 
notified by our automod via private message once the karma goal has been reached. 

These terms are necessary for us to continue providing a safe, positive and engaging community for queer men of all ages **18 and up** to connect with each other, 
that has always been the true purpose of this community. Thank you in advance for your utmost patience, and for taking the time to read. 

So if you're up to the job, go forth and be a friend to someone! <3

I completely understand you don't want to cut their lifeline from being homeless, but it doesn't seem like they are doing much to help themselves.

Keeping a car running isn't worth two shits if it fails inspection. On the RAV4 you can replace many *non-drivetrain components* with parts from the millions of other RAV4s sold in that generation because they share much in common. 

There are going to be physical components on these Fiskers that will break or fail, and if they do, they could be extremely difficult to replace if *the only extant parts are on other cars that have been manufactured.*

The inability to replace those parts is the problem. I'm sure your sponsors can find a way to maintain the drivetrain, but they're probably not going to have an answer for a broken windshield, a broken mirror assembly, or any of the other myriad things that will cause it to fail inspection and become wheeled e-waste.",1711929652.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am born and raised Catholic in Bangladesh, which is a developing country and 80% Muslim. Yes we exist, far and few but we do. Life as a religious minority was horrifying, as we were denied our basic human rights (e.g. constant death threats, systemic racism , low school/college  acceptance, low job acceptance/ promotion rate, less likely to get any sort of loan, higher rate or crimes committed against minority bc police don‚Äôt take us seriously- and this is only the beginning) 
The only way for us to move forward in life was by the help of the church and other Christian. The church provided us with security, community and a sense of belonging in a country where we weren‚Äôt accepted. Christian business owners were more likely to hire minorities and give them a fighting chance at climbing the ladder. The Christian Credit Union was created so Christian minorities can achieve financial freedom and get loans- it is now the leading credit union in Bangladesh. 
The church build Christian villages, orphanages, hospitals, schools and feed thousands of people a day, plus so much more. 

My family was targeted and chased out by an Islamic Extremist group called Jamaat-e-Islam. They are a political party who vowed to make Bangladesh a Islamic nation by getting rid of the minorities ( religious persecution and ethnic cleansing ) and unfortunately they used death, rape and torture to do that. We now live in the USA as religious refugees. 

I think religion is important because it creates communities and uplifts people. I grew up in a country where I was treated worse than an animal but the church (and community at large) was always there as a place for us to belong in. I am not pious or even religion by any means but I recognize the stability it provided for my community. 
We often times look at organized religion from the West‚Äôs perspective where religious persecution doesn‚Äôt exist to this level, which poses its own challenges. Churches here are money hungry bastards taking advantage of people good nature and using the word of god to commit atrocities against their own community. When the threat of survival isn‚Äôt prevalent human greed takes over and we loose sight of what is important. 

TLDR: i grew up as a Christian Minority in a Muslim country where we were targeted as a part of religious persecution from the government. The Church was the only things protecting our people from extinction. 
The church was the pinnacle of the Christian community providing healthcare, education, loans and a fighting chance at life.",1711929652.0

In the first year 6 heroes were made, along with unique executions, maps, Unique emotes, among other things. 

In the second and third years, we received 4 maps, and 4 heroes each year, with unique executions and other things. In year 2 Ubisoft gave everyone new sets and variations for the year 1 heroes with the promise that they would be given new sets later on.

In year 4, Covid happened and we received 2 new heroes with reused animations, 1 new duel map, unique armor variations and 1 new set for the first 3 year 1 heroes. We also stopped getting unique executions.

In year 5 we received no new maps, 2 heroes with reused animations and unique executions in the third season. And they started reskining old armor variations instead of making new ones.

In year 6 we received no maps, 2 new heroes (one of which had mostly reused animations) and hero fests had started being released. We also got 4 Hero skins. The trend of reskinned armor variations continued.

In year 7 we received 2 new heroes with unique animations, 4 hero skins, and we received less reskins, with the tradeoff of receiving the rest of the y1 heroes receiving their 5th set.

In year 8, we‚Äôre getting 5 hero skins, 2 converted maps, 2 new heroes, and I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre getting reskinned armour or new sets this season, but we‚Äôre slowly getting more and more content which means For Honor is performing better than previous yearsZ",1711929653.0

You may sit with the victims but I sit with the evidence. It's literally impossible to collect accurate statistics on false accusations because unless someone can PROVE it didn't happen (and proving a negative is next to impossible) you can't stat it as a false accusation. There's no way to accurately tell the rate of false accusations because in about 90+% of the cases, it's solely the complainant's word against the accused's and no one but the two of them know for sure what happened. So in cases like that, how do you decide whether it's a real or a false accusation precisely?

I'd disagree my understanding of the situation is biased - I'm aware that accusations can be true or false, and don't inherently believe either automatically. I believe in, shockingly enough, the presumption of innocence and that accused persons should be assumed innocent until and unless they are proven guilty.

"diablo4","t5_2rzx9","I didn't go into detail and didnt mention even half the issues with the game? I briefly mentioned them to flesh out of the fact that D4 is underperforming and overall not being well recieved. Charging for expansions could cause more players to jump ship when there is other options releasing expansions for free.   
Why are people gonna play D4 for ¬£50 to ¬£100 a year (Whether you buy battle passes), when you can play something else for a 1 time payment for -¬£35? 

So no, you completely missed the point. And allot of us don't care about Karma unlike the one making stupid comments and deletes them when they are disliked. Reddit is well known for its salty communites who can't accept valid critism. People get to comfy on social media and forget the real world exists where you will be critisized based on what you bring to the table. 

Basically every point I mentioned about Overwatch got flamed on Reddit. Every single thing I mentioned has now been implemented with the last one being Hero's unlocked for everyone. That just about sums up reddit. People won't let games they enjoy be critisized. Its either perfect or terrible. To many people have forgotten that things can be ok aswell. 

If I was really trying to deter D4 players then I could have listed so many things, show Steam charts of D4 and all the other aRPG's and so on. But I am not trying to be deceptive since D4 does things good aswell. Its combat is solid, it has some of the best art work in Diablo history, the story has been alright so far and I am about 25 hours in. The loot will be much better once they fix the abundance of modifiers and other stuff aswell. 

And its not a troll. It was a question. And it really just proves that people will defend companies when they laugh at you in return. The CEO's of these companies actually find it amuzing that people will pay for anything. You really think they became rich by buying video game bundles? They laugh at the people who do and people defend these practices! Bobby Kotick is an A hole but he didn't become rich by being stupid.",1711929655.0

"povertyfinance","t5_hcycg","Let's say that tray has about 9 servings of what you'd normally see is a 1 serving veggie cup at a gas station. Would it seem particularly ridiculous to have a veggie cup go for $5? Not exactly by gas station standards...as convenience stores tend to carry very small amounts of things that are priced very high. Similar to how the smallest unit items are most expensive. 

Now should you just walk into a grocery store grab a carrot, a celery, a head of cauliflower, a cucumber, a cluster of grapes, rinse them all and eat them whole at different points in time? For poverty finance, yea most likely. But what I see is that a lot of the lower income paycheck to paycheck folks that often work off hours don't have the bandwidth for that type of planning, it's similar to the spoon theory applied to financial stress. And in that situation they do have more money than time in relative terms. Unfortunately that means that all of the good habits that will put you in a better financial position are less accessible than they appear, if only because of how challenging the mindset can be to develop.

When you first learn to prep food at home as with anything there's a learning curve and a lot of time wasted. It took me a long time to figure out what the most efficient way to make tasty healthy food at home was, and it was frustrating. I was fortunate to have the time to stick with it and improve. Eventually it paid dividends and saved me a ton of money and I rarely eat at restaurants not even out of a restriction but more that it's become less enjoyable compared to what I can do, but not everyone has the bandwidth to take that trajectory.",1711929655.0

You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.

The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.

When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.

No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.

I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.

You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.

You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.

Even this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.

Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.

In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.

You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.

It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.",1711929655.0

Strength, Dexterity, Mind, Inteligence, Weapon damage.

Vitality Increases your HP.

Determination is a flat damage increase.

Critical Hit increases your crit rate AND critical damage. Base crit rate is 5% and Crit damage is 40%.

Direct hit increases your direct hit rate. A direct hit is basically a mini crit. It always increases the damage by an attack that direct hits by 25%.

Skillspeed/Spellspeed. Reduces the recast time of Skills/Spells. NOT ABILITIES.

Tenacity. Reduces damage taken by a small ammount, and Increases damage dealt by about 70% as much as det. Only works on tanks

Piety. Increases mana regeneration rate. Only works on healers

In general, for most classes, stack crit as much as possible, and meld det and direct hit.

On tanks, avoid melding tenacity if possible, as its better to meld direct hit or det. Its not a bad stat or anything, but the others are better.

On healers, Avoid piety with a ten foot poll if possible. It is worth dropping 20 ilevels to not have piety on anything but weapon.",1711929655.0

Unfortunately, your post has been removed automatically as it's been caught by our post filter, but it's nothing personal!
Our subreddit operates under a system where we only allow self-posts to the main sub feed for sufficiently detailed, discussion-oriented topics. As you can imagine, we get many users posting about a lot of the exact same achievements and personal anecdotes, asking a lot of the same relatively simple questions and other non-discussion-oriented topics, which gets highly repetitive and makes the main feed uninteresting for users to read, and a pain for mods to moderate.
If this is what your post was, there is a better place in our community for these kinds of things! You can come to the subreddit's [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/bwf) for live discussion with our users! You can also post to the subreddit's [Daily Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/search/?q=Daily%20Discussion%20Thread&source=recent&restrict_sr=1&sort=new).
However, if you are trying to start a discussion that is not simply a question about your own program and you still got caught by this filter, try expanding a little bit more in your post to make it a really juicy topic. Message a mod if you're still getting caught by the filter!

"HonkaiStarRail_leaks","t5_55njyr","Now this is a stark contrast from how Acheron was being talked about before..

Acheron is heavily, heavily team dependent, and the example for a 1 turn ult is one of the best case scenarios with Trend, I assume, or worse luck with trend compensated by her lightcone, E2, or both. A much more realistic scenario, but even still quite favourable one, would be a 2 turn ult, which halved sheet damage, but even in practise, Acheron deals a lot of overkill damage that, while it looks good on paper, actually results in quite a bit of damage loss. 

While her need for her lightcone definitely isn't as huge as it was said to be, she is still heavily lightcone dependent on top of her existing team dependency, and your best options will be S3-5 GNSW if you're lucky, shelling out 30 pulls in Stardust for Welt's cone, or extremely unlikely, any spare 5 star Nihility cones you happen to have.

Tip...partial ocean view rooms are better than the standard ocean view rooms at this resort. So save yourself the money. The standard ocean view is ocean view,  but it is much further from the ocean.

Le posizioni da data scientist, data analyst sono s√¨ interessanti, ma attraggono moltissimi candidati da tutte le discipline STEM, per cui la competizione √® altissima. Le retribuzioni sono pi√π basse e si fermano a un certo livello.

> temo di potermene stancare un giorno e ritrovarmi con competenze molto specifiche e forse meno trasferibili in altri settori

Un consiglio su questo: quello che dici √® vero, ma lo √® per qualsiasi percorso lavorativo. Le grandi aziende cercano sempre personale specializzato, il che significa che dopo pochi anni in un ruolo diventa difficile fare il salto ad altri settori senza ricominciare da zero. Per questo √® molto importante informarsi prima e scegliere con cura dove cercare il primo lavoro (o i primi due). Perch√® √® quello che indirizzer√† tutta la tua vita lavorativa.",1711929657.0

"AuDHDWomen","t5_6iu11d","I haven't had the same experience re: low interoception, so I won't weigh in on that, but some things that have helped me drink more water in general:

1. I make water a 'treat' drink. I add a squeeze of lemon juice, a fruity tea bag, protein water, powder, or 'water drops'.

If you haven't heard of water drops, this is the brand I use: [Water Drops](https://vitalzing.com/)

2. I use a big rounded glass that feels really nice in my hand. I bought an insulated travel cup that feels the same, which lives on my desk at work. I use chilled water from the fridge and add plenty of ice. The little sensory joys of a cold, smooth cup in my hand and the feeling of icy cold water make it more rewarding.

3. I make it easier to drink water by having water in lots of places - visual reminders work better for me than alarms, phone reminders etc. I often use a straw because it's easier to sip on when I'm doing another task. 

TLDR: Try any little tweaks that make drinking water more appealing, more accessible, or more visible.",1711929658.0

"PhotoshopRequest","t5_2u2ui","Hello u/motorcitymaniac734, thanks for posting on /r/PhotoshopRequest! Please note:

- Do not work with anyone who did not comment publicly on your request. If anyone contacts you privately about your request, simply ignore them. If you have a request for which you do not want to post the image(s) to be edited publicly, please provide as much detail as possible about the request and ask that interested editors reply to your post. From there, you can vet the editors who reply by viewing their comment histories and reach out privately to whomever you'd like to work with. Again, **do not respond to any direct private messages about your request.**

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

 This is a community of support for Pet owners whose Pets have passed away. It is actively moderated.

 Pet owners, as loving, caring people, often have strong opinions on pet care practices. Some of these are controversial. This is not a forum 
 for debate on such issues, nor is it a place to scold a contributor for a perceived mistake in managing their pet. We intend to provide a safe 
 haven of understanding and support. Strident, mean-spirited posts or comments will be deleted. Those who persist in preaching versus caring may 
 be warned and then banned or may be banned permanently based on nature of the topic. If a conversational thread meanders into a discussion 
 unrelated to pet loss support, it will be truncated.

 Those who post here are vulnerable and hurting. Even a minor slap has a hard sting. Those of us who are lucky enough to be able to turn away 
 from our computers or put down our phones and hug a healthy, happy pet are truly blessed. Threads must remain supportive and caring, even if 
 one disagrees with something that has been said.

"IsaacArthur","t5_3g7ux","For smaller habitats, even a *little* bit of gravity - 1/10 g probably - should be enough to shower, to scrub and mop surfaces, etc.  Harder to do in microgravity.

For smaller habitats, you would recycle the water, reclaiming it from urine and greywater from cleaning the hab and showering.  You might have a small greenery area that you cycle your air through to improve it's quality.  (some bushes or algae or something)

You would get fresh soap by just importing it, a smaller habitat won't have the room to manufacture something like that.  You might try to find a way to use less soap, such as using extremely concentrated soap that you add water to and it's a computer controlled dispenser in the shower so everyone has to stick to their soap and shampoo ration.  Yet one more thing to complain about in space lol.  

Much larger habitats will likely have their own factories and farms, and be closer to true closed loop, where they can manufacture everything used in the habitat except perhaps very high end components, which they get by trade with other habitats.

"NicksHandmadeBoots","t5_4hggr3","Oh boy, there is a bunch of things you asked here that don‚Äôt equate. Hopefully an employee can weigh in but you really should youtube some videos on the topic.

There is a difference between a bonded or glued outsole like Blundstone which is not designed for resoling. And a boot which is manufactured with repair in mind and uses glue or glue and stitch. 

It‚Äôs like seeing a semi truck tire being retreaded and wondering why a car tire cant have the same thing done. 

Some boots and shoes are simply designed to wear out and be thrown away because resoling is either not possible, or too expensive and costs more or close to a new pair. 

A boot like Nicks is constructed in a way that the boots upper is its own structure, the outsole is a piece added to the bottom with glue/stitching or just glue. It is designed and structured in a way that allows the outsole to be removed and replaced easily, (cost is another factor which has changed over time) 

There is also the variable of the type of sole, the crepe outsoles are only glued because of the material and thickness, v100 is typically both glued and stitched for example for added security. 

Also yes a stitch down construction ‚Äúwelt‚Äù does deteriorate with resoles due to stitches, its a negative of the construction, Goodyear welting for example doesn‚Äôt and has similar levels of built quality. Cemented boots typically dont or cant be resoled due to cost or design or both",1711929663.0

My group of TTRPG friends are a pretty big fan of it. The system kinda punishes combat so you need a decent story that doesn't rely on it. Its strengths are its character creation system which is geared towards grounded, fleshed out personalities. The system tries to advertise being a multitool but really it's good for apocalypse, roleplay-centric, and ""normal people put into abnormal situation"" campaigns

The only thing I said was wrong was his GF belittling him by hounding him to hear her bodycount when he didn't want to. He admits he was insecure and had trouble getting hard for her. So she knew she was increasing the pressure on him and making him feel insecure. 

You address none of this and instead repeat yourself ad infinitum that he was wrong to share these details after promising not to. You're right I am arguing she didn't deserve him keeping that promise when she couldn't honor his desire not to know her past. I never said OP said that lol.

- If you're having issues uploading to Reddit, trying using an alternative host like Vidble.com, Redgifs.com, or any from [this list](https://reddit.com/r/SubredditRegulator/wiki/index/approved-hosts/). Do not use Imgur as they don't allow NSFW content any more.
- Upload an album, make it private, then paste the direct album link (or 3 direct image links) into a message to the mod team.

You saying you won't date a model who doesn't know you exist is also a nonstop repost and power fantasy. It's easy to turn down an offer no one made. Stop spamming us with Onlyfans complaints.

You have more opportunities with Louis to develop some kind of relationship, friendship/romantic than any other character because he is a more approachable, likable, inviting character than Violet. The introverted and closed Violet's character actually hinders her growth from being likable and makes her less appealing to get to know on a deeper level. Plus Violet doesn't grow. She stays the same from episode 1 to the final episode with not much improvement from her character arch. She is still that shy, introverted character you know since the beginning of episode 1. Louis changes from being a slack of in the beginning to mature and be dependable when you break through his mask and barriers.",1711929667.0

"balkans_irl","t5_n458w","Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.

I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.

The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.

Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.

You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.

If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.

You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.

The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.

I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.

When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.

My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.",1711929668.0

The reason the trans people you know probably were not comfortable explaining it to you is because it can be very emotionally tiring explaining and justifying  our existence over and over.   Especially the specific questions you put up, which are the exact things being politicized by the right.  I will address them though. 

On bathrooms and pronouns.  These both come from the same place of misunderstanding.  The reason these aren‚Äôt computing for you is because you are starting with the premise that I am a man.  I am not.  I am a woman.  As a woman I should be able to use the bathroom that conforms to my gender.  As a woman I should be afforded the basic respect of having people referring to me as such (she/her).  The circumstances of my birth are irrelevant to this. The role of woman in our society is my role.  My brain functions as a woman. I have a life history of examples of this that are too numerous to go into now. I‚Äôm a woman,  and my genital arrangement only matters to me and my partners so should not factor into anything.  

Drag shows for kids is a completely different topic that actually has nothing to do with being transgender.  Most (but not all) drag performers are gay men. And that‚Äôs exactly what they are, performers. Their gender presentation is part of that performance.   And gender presentation is also not inherently sexual, which is what you are assuming when you have issues with them reading books to kids.   Of a woman dresses up as a fairy princess to read stories to kids, no one bats an eye.  There is functionally zero difference between that and a drag performer doing the same thing.   Drag is an area just like plays.  There are plays that are appropriate for kids.  And there are plays that are not appropriate.  Same goes for drag performance

For example, counter picking should not be in a competitive game. Should there be some degree of thought into what hero you pick, but the decisions that decide a match shouldn't be happening at the hero select screen.

It also means there's less skill expression, since if someone picks a hero that hard counters what you pick, you don't get to play it, no matter how good you are. And when that's happening at a team level, it leads to circumstances where you either play the meta or you flat out lose.

"Coppercookware","t5_4c1yyi","That's decades-old, heavily used tin and is too heavily oxidized to clean up nicely. Although it's intact, tin that's turned from metallic dark gray to chalky like this isn't great to cook with. So they need retinning to be nice to use, but the verdigris, pitting and filth aren't really an issue, there just will be some texture/character to them where the verdigris corroded the metal after retinning. 

Send one or two of them to a cookware retinning specialist to see if you like using copper, if not you can probably recoup the retinning cost listing them on eBay. American made Bazar Francais (as opposed to their made in France line, which are high end Villedieu) don't go for big money but they are well made and sought after. 

The copper isn't all that thin really, these are in the 1-1.5mm range. Many collectors will sniff at this gauge, but copper like this was intended for stovetop cooking, works great on a gas stove, and has historically been seen as desirable cookware especially for home kitchens. 1mm copper cooks differently than 3mm but not necessarily worse, mainly it's a trade-off between responsiveness and heat retention with thinner vs thicker copper. I personally use my 1.5mm skillets, saucepans, gratins, etc much more often than my 2.5-3mm copper and wouldn't trade them for super heavy ones, there's a lot to be said for an even heating pan that also offers precise heat control and tossability.",1711929669.0

My ex basically said he didn't want to communicate anymore about serious things and also said he had trouble being honest. I tried to make it work for 2 years on and off but gave up. Luckily, we co-parent well and rarely fight about stuff about the baby.

I grew up seeing my parents fight and realized that I didn't want that for my child. I've been raising my baby mostly by myself (but I live with family who help). Dad comes to see her about every other week for a few days at a time.

Returns are a pain in the butt now and the kindle membership library and Amazon prime membership library are almost completely different.

I wanted help in the house. He worked remotely while I was working in an office. When I came home, I noticed the mess and went to clean it. However, since he was there all day, I just wanted him to pick up a bit just so I'm not overwhelmed. Every time I told him this, it became a battle, and he said that I wanted him to be a mind reader. So after all of this, and this was an ongoing thing for three months after our marriage, I couldn't bring myself to do it. We were beginning our house hunting when we had one more fight, and I just knew I was no longer happy.",1711929671.0
"dayton","t5_2rlxw","I built with Fischer Homes about two and a half years ago in the tail end of a development in the South side of town. 

They're definitely a large-scale developer and can be subject to some of the pitfalls of that. 

Since they bulk buy everything for their builds -- prefab sections of roofing framing, to windows, to siding, to appliances -- delays can occur on your project as they wait for prices to stabilize. We got caught up in the lumber pricing surge and saw our project stall until prices dipped back down a little bit. Windows for our neighbors took a while to go in as they waited for the supply chain to get its act together. Etc. 

The build crews and construction managers can be hit or miss, at least from what I can tell from a Facebook group for those who are building with them. Ours were typically above average, but I also made my presence known regularly on the construction site and was able to keep an eye on things throughout the build. Dropping a case of beer of for the crews a few times seemed to earn us some extra TLC. 

Post-build, Fischer definitely dropped the ball on planting our yard (which they chose to do at the end of August after not properly clearing the construction site), and getting our 12-month follow up work done was like pulling teeth.

That said, we've been happy with the home's quality and we haven't had any major complications. The process wasn't so bad that I would warn anyone away from building with them.",1711929671.0

 The *only* reason he is trying to be ""progressive"" is because he knows it's good for his image and for getting people to convert to Catholicism. It's disgusting. He eats with us with one face, and calls being transgender an ""ugly ideology"" with the other. 

 >Pope Francis on Friday warned of the dangers of gender theory, saying he had commissioned studies into what he condemned as an ""ugly ideology"" that threatens humanity. 

 >Addressing participants of a two-day conference in the Vatican on the evolving role of men and women according to Christian teachings, Francis said what he called ""gender ideology"" was a threat because it sought to erase the difference between the sexes.

 >""I have asked that studies be carried out into this ugly ideology of our times, which cancels out the differences and makes everything the same,"" the Pope said.

 >The 87-year-old pontiff said he was still suffering from a recent cold and had asked an aide to read his speech, but first wanted to ""underline"" his feelings on gender theory.

Erik is just fine.  Nico is decent, but I'm not sure if his lack of confidence is holding him back or the ""no jamming"" edict.  Either way, he seems timid and isn't really playing anything all that mindblowing.  Again, serviceable.

 This is a community of support for Pet owners whose Pets have passed away. It is actively moderated.

 Pet owners, as loving, caring people, often have strong opinions on pet care practices. Some of these are controversial. This is not a forum 
 for debate on such issues, nor is it a place to scold a contributor for a perceived mistake in managing their pet. We intend to provide a safe 
 haven of understanding and support. Strident, mean-spirited posts or comments will be deleted. Those who persist in preaching versus caring may 
 be warned and then banned or may be banned permanently based on nature of the topic. If a conversational thread meanders into a discussion 
 unrelated to pet loss support, it will be truncated.

 Those who post here are vulnerable and hurting. Even a minor slap has a hard sting. Those of us who are lucky enough to be able to turn away 
 from our computers or put down our phones and hug a healthy, happy pet are truly blessed. Threads must remain supportive and caring, even if 
 one disagrees with something that has been said.

"197","t5_3enhu","Believing in an afterlife is sugarpilling the concept of death to something more akin to a simple change of location, even if the afterlife in question were to be a bad place. The idea of ceasing to exist is scary! Most people would serve life in prison rather than dying.

Atheism is only inherently nihilistic if you believe everything that comes from life has to be a result of religion, there are ways to get meaning outside of believing in an afterlife. On the other hand, extreme nihilism is always atheistic, but that's not the point.

I obviously see that the post in question was very insensitive and more of a karma farming. It was meant for a community of people that are already receptive to the message (atheists), not for the directly involved parents. If you don't think that celebrating life over an afterlife, reinforcing the idea that an afterlife exists, and that deceiving children into believing that from a very young age is wrong, you're likely religious yourself and that's the obvious reason why you don't agree with most of the posts on a subreddit dedicated to atheistsüëç.",1711929672.0

6 months later, she had dropped out of school and was looking for a job.  I got a phone call from a prospective employer for her.  I told them everything and that she did not have my permission to use me as a reference. 

She called me up, screaming at me because she had lost that opportunity.  I reminded her that I had revoked my permission, and this is what happens when you lie.

"cricut","t5_2tkav","I wish I knew what it should be for each type of vinyl because today with my Cricut Maker, I cut three different types of vinyl on their predetermined settings and all it did was make extra work for me. 

1. Oracal 631 removable vinyl (matte) did really well except for a few letters that had a thin inset line in them‚Äî The machine peeled up the inset line and part of the letters.

2. Cricut premium permanent vinyl (glossy) didn‚Äôt cut all the way through on the first pass, and I had to send it through a second time, at which point, it also peeled a couple of the thin inset lines, although not as badly as Oracal‚Äôs vinyl. 

3. Cricut premium adhesive foil (very thin, very shiny) cut perfectly on one pass with default settings, but I could not peel back the carrier sheet to save my life. It was adhered to the foil so well that it would not separate at any of the corners or any of the letters. I punctured the carrier paper and vinyl (together) so many times because I couldn‚Äôt get the pick or the tweezers in between the two sheets! So frustrating! (It‚Äôs really pretty though).

When I brought it back down it was like the colour had returned to my world and I improved quickly afterwards with treatment from an osteopath.

"AirTags","t5_27eri7","Apple has anti-stalking features, including informing someone that an air tag is ""following"" them if it's not registered to them, and beeping after a while to make it easier to find a stalker's air tag.  So registering an air tag with someone else's ID is going to drive you nuts.  

I put an air tag in each of our cars, each one registered to the car's driver.  But last week my car needed to go in for service and my husband gave me rides from the service center in the morning and back to the center in the late day.  I got alerts that an air tag was ""following me""--it was the air tag in my husband's car.

people like us: because sometimes, just sometimes, they need to be stopped from going too far‚Äù

When a governor general of a planet besieged by necrons is conversing with a Krieger:

‚ÄòThis space port and its environs, GeneralHanrik, are packed with able-bodied refugees, bereft of purpose. Whateverfunctions those people once had in your society, they can no longer serve them.‚Äô
‚ÄòBut how‚Ä¶? We just don‚Äôt have the equipment to outfit them. Ours has alwaysbeen a peaceful world, colonel, we have never had need of a substantial armedforce.‚Äô
‚ÄòYou agreed,‚Äô said the colonel, ‚Äòthat your people are a resource, and we mustsurely utilise all the resources at our disposal. They are loyal subjects of theEmperor?‚Äô
‚ÄòOf course. Of course they are loyal, but‚Äì‚Äô
‚ÄòThen they will be pleased to offer their lives to Him.

When the results of that discussion pan out,

‚ÄòCannon fodder!‚Äô Hanrik burst out. ‚ÄòYou used my men as cannon fodder, putthem on the front lines to be slaughtered. I‚Äôve been listening to the reports, andthey‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a massacre out there!‚Äô

‚ÄòThey are soldiers, General Hanrik. They knew what to expect.‚Äô

I don't know if this is helpful but I think sometimes it can be good to take a step back and remember that gaming often draws out people who are deeply unhappy with their own lives and who feel the need to drag others down for whatever reason. Some people believe that just because they have an anonymous username that it gives them a blank check for being mean or cruel. 

There's also a psychological effect known as ""negativity bias"" where negative reactions tend to stick out more in our minds and often times are seen as more intelligent or more valid than positive reactions. If five people say ""your base is cool"" and five people say ""your base sucks"" then it's very easy to pay more attention to the negativity even though there are just as many positive people and even neutral people are often just psychologically more likely to agree with anyone being critical. Similarly I've also noticed on social media that the more visibility a post attracts the more likely you are to get some really hateful and spiteful comments. If I make a comment that gets 200 upvotes that probably means several hundred people have seen it and out of that big crowd it's almost a guarantee someone hates what I just wrote. Sometimes it can be hard to avoid taking things personally but if 200 people saw what I posted and liked it but 3 or 4 people decided to try to make me feel horrible about myself... well that's the price of posting something popular.

In terms of gameplay, I usually see the 2ACW end well before China unifies. In terms of lore, China isn't likely to stay pacified, and joining the CPS is a commitment to pretty much endless war in East Asia that doesn't benefit Ireland or the USA at all. And this isn't really a great deal for Japan, either. Ideology aside, what happens in Europe doesn't have much impact on Japan, and a commitment to shenanigans in the West is something an overstretched Japan really doesn't need.

&#x200B;

>it also has an interest in killing Syndies and also beating up an anti-exploitation China 

America has an interest in easy money in China, sure. But there's a big difference between gunboat diplomacy and fighting a protracted land war in Asia, especially with the 2ACW having already exhausted the U.S., and even more so with a syndie threat in Europe. And remember, the USA can make much more money in Asia from weak, independent states than countries explicitly organized to provide maximum benefit to Japan.

In a nutshell, Japan has very different problems and interests from the USA and Ireland and vice versa, and combining their problems doesn't help any of them. Ireland teaming up with Japan is funny, but I imagine there's a reason it's locked behind an extremely unlikely series of events.",1711929674.0

"quora","t5_2s7px","I still use it to answer questions, but I wouldn't recommend it for asking questions or starting discussions, only for answering the questions that already exist. 

Reason being is because Quora is full of fake intellectual people who are either pretending to be smarter than they really are, or lack the awareness that they are not as smart as they think.  Most of the people who answer questions on Quora either don't comprehend the question you're asking, or their heads are too far up their own asses. Either way, you won't get anything useful and you'll actually end up more frustrated than intellectually satisfied if you try to start a conversation. 

A lot of the people on their are faking their credentials too. There's this one person, Janet Reddy. She claims she is a former PhD Psychologist, but she doesn't understand that saying there is a correlation between two variables is the same as saying there is a relationship between the two variables. She thinks a correlation is the measurement you use to test two variables, but it's the process of measuring them, it's not measurement itself. 

I've been trying to explain this to her for 2 days because her answer to a question was wrong based on her misunderstanding what a correlation is. She keeps insisting she's right though, which makes it easy to see why she is a ***former*** Psychologist. 

But there are lots of people on Quora like this. They are ill informed and full of misinformation, but they aren't smart enough to realize they are misinformed. And when you try to correct them, they lash out at you. 

And they commit all kinds of logical fallacies that if logical fallacies were an STD, Quora would be a cesspool of infection and disease.",1711929674.0

"Neuropsychology","t5_2rhda","Did you see a doctor and they told you FND? This term FND is not helpful and used by narcisistic physicians, though perhaps not always. It is poor thinking or abuse of patients. I have some knowledge of bowel issues like people would describe as IBS-D, but I don't know much about your symptoms. I have heard that indoor mold exposure can cause digestive issues and neurological symptoms.  Presumably the mold is colonzied and producing mycotoxins. These mycotoxins can be tested for with blood test from a company like [mymycotest.com](http://mymycotest.com) which serves worldwide. They have a video saying that the fungal infection has to be treated with Itraconazole as it is not a single cell organism like yeast that responds to other anti-fungals.

I do not know if this is your issue or responsible for some of your problems, but it is something that is very overlooked for digestive and neurological toxicity symptoms. I don't know why you can't move your legs and that is concerning. You can't move them at all? Did anything precipitate this? There may be some small help by inclining the head end of your bed at least six inches by risers as this has some health benefits for gastric reflux, vascular circulation and neurology. It is called inclined bed therapy, but don't expect anything big from that.",1711929674.0

"gallbladders","t5_2xr5d","The symptoms you've described - especially the colour of your stools - all point towards gallbladder. 

The unfortunate thing about gallstones is once you've got them, they never go away completely. Your gallbladder will keep getting worse. 

I'd had a few bouts of bad attacks last autumn and was referred (NHS) for surgery in November. Between then and now I didn't have any of the awful, vomiting, unable to get out of bed attacks. ""just"" daily pain and discomfort, problems with digestion, fatigue etc. Some days a milder attack where the pain was enough to stop me doing what I had planned. By the time I was getting close to surgery I had started to think along the same lines as you, but given what I'd learned about gallbladders only getting worse in time, I went ahead with the op. 

They found it was scarred and sticking to the surrounding tissue, including my liver. It took a bit of time for them to carefully remove it without damaging those surrounding structures. If I'd left it longer, that situation could have got a lot worse. 

It also doesn't take much for a grumbly gallbladder to swing into an infected, dangerous, rupturing gallbladder potentially causing liver and pancreas damage. 

In your shoes (which I kind of was), I'd go ahead with the surgery.",1711929675.0

4. DID is something that can (and usually will) take professionals years to diagnose in someone, let alone a minor who likely won't get diagnosed at all. In no way does someone's basic research compare to the years of schooling and experience that a professional has. Yet they claim to be able to diagnose themselves with such a complex dissociative disorder in days because of their ""heavy research.""

5. For some people, going on a deep dive into something like DID can cause them to subconsciously start faking symptoms. This doesn't apply to everyone, but I know it can apply to many people and it's something that applies to myself. As an example, using my experience with this (It wasn't DID but it could happen for that as well) I went on a spree researching rabies just because I was bored and it went on for days. I had myself dead convinced that I had rabies and started to subconsciously start showing symptoms of it. That's not even considering how many self diagnosed people start off by talking to other ""systems"" and suddenly they have signs of the disorder to, which even the fakers who influence this admit happens.

6. If what you're experiencing is caused by psychosis of some kind, you're not going to know. You may claim that you know what you're experiencing, but if you're in a state of psychosis, you won't suspect you're in a state of psychosis. That also may be worded wrong, sorry, lol.

7. If you do decide to do self treatment, you could be doing it completely wrong which can worsen what really is wrong with you in some cases. Symptoms of disorders can overlap and many people forget that. When you're being fed content about DID or any disorder you're now wanting to self diagnose, you're going to overlook the fact that symptoms can be because of other disorders. If you're treating the wrong thing, the actual issue is not going to get better.

8. Using your platform to spread awareness while being wrong is something that has been happening a lot recently, which can be seen on the sub alone. (as well as FDC) When you're self diagnosed and trying to give information on something you don't know for sure if you have, and probably don't have, you're going to make people with similar issues go down the same rabbit hole as you. Whether you're saying a normal thing is now a DID experience or a symptom of another disorder is DID, you're spreading misinformation and claiming you're not because of ""heavy research"" that you were self diagnosed with.

9. Not even medical professionals can diagnose themselves. Self diagnosis is always going to be biased and you're always going to validate yourself and your opinion, especially if you have a hard time accepting when you're wrong about something. 

Okay so I had 6 more reasons that I could think of fast. There are definitely more if you really think about every scenario, but there are no real benefits to self diagnosis. The only thing seen as a benefit is ""knowing"" what is wrong. You can suspect something is wrong and not full on diagnose yourself for sure and if you choose to do that you shouldn't try to speak from the perspective of someone who is diagnosed, because you can and likely will hurt someone with misinformation by doing so. But knowing what is wrong with you does not make the issue go away. It can make it worse at times if you begin to exaggerate symptoms.",1711929675.0

"Natalism","t5_2vp2p","Afghanistan's fertility rate is still above 4.50 and Pakistan's around 3.50. Their rates have fallen but they haven't ""plummeted"", and I'd argue that Iran's low fertility rate (1.60 to 1.70) reflects the reality that the regime is completely alien to a more socially liberal young population that is only nominally Islamic.

But also, to hone my argument, my point is about traditionalist versus socially liberal in a Western context. Pointing to heavily secular Japan and South Korea is not relevant here.

Within western populations, the socially liberal have few children compared to relatively higher fertility rates among the traditionalists. This transcends economics and I suspect you actually know this but you're trying to save face.

Regardless, I'm happy to look at any non-capitalist examples you can provide, that can disprove that a strong religious and/or socially conservative motivator is needed for high fertility levels.",1711929676.0

"genewolfe","t5_2trh7",">Can't help but also remark here: Horn's boat-rape scene goes way harder than Severian's. It's interesting that Wolfe would re-approach such a similar moral quandary to the reader, except he doubles down like ""Yes it was rape. Can you understand or forgive him?""

It does go so much harder, doesn't it. I agree that it is notable and very interesting. I think what he's doing is daring to reveal more of what a character he is identifying with has done, with the prize being that if he gets forgiveness... even with this, he'll know someone has really seen everything about him, and not rejected him. This is Horn's aim, as we know -- to reveal everything to his wife, Nettle. She will have seen... everything, he claims. But of course this is not quite true because, like the main character in Killers of the Flower Moon, he can't admit to his intention to actually murder his wife; it's too much for him. Nor can he admit that he may have almost consciously have deliberately baited an inhumi so he would not just kill him, but much of his family as well. And of course, whether truly the case or not, Horn makes sure we know (and that his wife knows) that his rape of Seawrack may have not shown anything particular about him, for it being the fate of all men who hear a siren's song -- all will lose control into rape and violence. 

Someone has written recently on this site that Seawrack possesses elements of an older woman, a mother, and I think is important. For I see her as to some extent almost a bit, not like a child to the world, but a veteran of it, someone who can take everything you throw at them, and withstand you. There is a way in which she functions in the text almost like an ideal therapist, whom you come to understand will not reject you if you stop presenting yourself less than honestly, if you reveal to her the full extent of your ""badness,"" out of fear of experiencing what you surely experienced in your first parents, complete rejection. Wolfe shows us many parents... and wives, who reject you the first time you show something about yourself which is unpalatable. Alden Weer's parents being the first example that comes to mind, but there are others. Skip from Home Fires fears his wife left him bcs he was boring.",1711929677.0

"WorkAdvice","t5_323xq","I worked at a pet supply/gift shop/plant nursery for a few months.

During the interview I was told that there would be 4-5 people working once the plants were delivered. And that we'd be closed 2 days a week until those people were hired since the only other employee was just finishing up their notice period.

We did not close at all. No one else was hired. I suggested daily that we close at least one day a week and promote the hiring beyond the sign on the counter.

I ended up working 40 days straight and normally 12 hours a day but not less than 8. I was expected to take care of the store pets and fish that we sold, keep the store clean and stocked, keep the garage (always kept open during our hours) clean, keep both greenhouses clean as well as keeping the plants clean (picking out every dead/unsightly flower or leaf), unloading plant trucks after (and sometimes before) close, all while checking in with every customer and being at the counter before the customer could get there.

I had told my boss I would need my friends graduation off upon hire. Two days before the graduation she said I might be able to go if it was slow. Next day, I was loading a trailer up with freshly watered hanging plants for the night and I got so dizzy I almost passed out and fell out of the trailer. I wasn't allowed any breaks. I had constant rashes the whole time I worked there.

So I waited until the store was closed and gave my boss my keys and let her know that I wouldn't be returning. I knew I wouldn't physically be able to come in the next day. I was being tested for MS at the time and my boss was fully aware of my medical issues.

She was pissed that I waited until after close, but I did it that way so she wouldn't have to worry about that while we had customers. Although, I guess that wouldn't have been an issue for her since she spent her days in a portioned off area of a greenhouse arranging special order hanging plants. 

The next day I saw she was advertising the job on Facebook and reduced the store hours to 6 hours a day, 5 days a week.",1711929677.0

"EatCheapAndVegan","t5_35y3z","#**Welcome to r/EatCheapAndVegan.**
**Veganism is not a diet**. However, there is a ton of misinformation and misunderstanding about the cost of **eating vegan** and this subreddit exists to hopefully dispell those false claims. Be advised submissions containing expensive processed food items will be removed.



**Definition of veganism:** *Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.*

"oasis","t5_2sic7","When I watch 2008-2009 gigs, I can tell something is amiss. The chemistry between Liam and Noel is non-existent.

Both of them seem frustrated.

Meanwhile... Gem, Andy, and Chris are at their very best. I feel bad for them.

Dig Out Your Soul's lyrics seem to allude to discontent as well as a sense that the end is near. I've always interpreted it that way. For example, I doubt Liam would've written something like I'm Outta Time or Soldier On if he had been truly happy with his place in the band.

I suspect the 20k *might* be before the recent nerfs, or it could be the US still has many more points than us.  If they're getting \~500 points they'd probably get around 20k. For note, even though they nerfed everything on the 23rd, this month I've still got 21,647 points.  Not sure what next month will work out to be, will have to wait and see.  (that's actually pretty high tbh, and I suspect the 2,500 points from the old console bonus popping up this month has a lot to do with it).

Something is off here though. Have you met his family and/or vice versa?  

Additionally, you were very quick to run the bases with someone else... As much as I understand doing so... That must have really blown his mind. Deserved or not. 

It sounds like you really valued your relationship with him, but just those words alone were enough to just cut it off completely. I wonder if he just didn't get it. 

A lot of people are demonizing him, and perhaps you are too. I get that as well, but at the same time, to assume he's playing the field and just stringing you along seems like a jump in a way. If anything, he has been nothing but a boyfriend to you, even showing up to comfort you when you are ill, even though he didn't feel comfortable saying ""I'm your boyfriend"" at that moment.

"VanLife","t5_2wii5","You don't need any of that. Go to academy sports and get yourself a fold-out camping cot and a sleeping bag use under a pad get yourself a couple of comforters at bed bath & beyond. Line the inside of your van with a comforters with magnets or some wooden strips and staples. Get yourself some plastic shelving from Walmart or something and put that up in your van. But the stuff you want in there and then go around and live your life in your van for a little while and then if you decide you really want hardwood cabinets and all that other stuff in there which I doubt you will decide but if you decide you want all that you'll know exactly how much you need. But you sure don't need everything you've got there. You got to decide whether what you're trying to do is live van life or what you're trying to do is to recreate a small apartment show and Tell in your van. Are you really more interested in building something or you actually interested in getting out there and trying the van life. If you're trying the van life I'd suggest get the minimal you need for under $200 a caught from academy sports a sleeping bag for a bed pad some cheap carpeting to throw on the floor some bed comforters to throw in the walls and some plastic shelving to put whatever you want to put on there and then go out there and see how you like it.",1711929680.0

Does anyone even read these automatic messages?  

All posts on this subreddit are locked automatically. Stop messaging us and asking what you did wrong because we are going to make fun of you.  Once again, all posts are locked automatically.  Comments are really pointless, especially if you see the same lame ones all the time. That's why they're turned off.  You want to talk with someone send them a message or a chat.  If you don't know how to do that from either mobile or PC then how did you get this far into reddit to begin with?

If you wish to contact **/u/throwawayacct4269**  you can do so by **[clicking here to send a message](/message/compose/?to=throwawayacct4269)** or by starting a chat. To do that, click or tap on their user name and you will see the option.

[Here's a link to the rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderManPersonals/about/rules/) So if your post gets removed you can look and see why.  If you see a problem with this post report it. If you have proof that this person is fake, asking for money, or selling stuff in private messages you need to take a screen shot and send that as proof to the mods.  Don't just report as ""fake"" or ""spam"" or ""seller"" without proof because your report will be ignored and their post will be approved.  Once again, we need proof to remove a post or ban someone.  Seems simple enough, but who the hell has even read this far into an automatic post made by good old automoderator?



**Original post:**



I‚Äôve been single for way too long and I really miss playing with someone‚Äôs vagina. There are so many fun ways to play with pussy and I‚Äôm hoping to find someone who would like to cum a few times with my help. Here‚Äôs why I love playing with someone‚Äôs vagina:

* I love groping at your crotch over your clothes and rubbing your pussy lips and pressing against your clit.
* I love feeling how warm it gets between your legs when I rub your crotch.
* I love that moment of unbuttoning jeans and sliding them down to reveal your pretty panties.
* I love seeing how wet I can get your panties before sliding them down.
* I love the sweet smell and taste of your vagina as I kneel down and lick your slit.
* I love the noises you make as I explore and play with your pussy.
* I love how wet you get as I vigorously finger and rub you to orgasm.

I'm not sure exactly what could be causing that, but I can recommend some things I can almost guarantee will work

L-phenylalanine supplement on empty stomach before meds, it's better than tyrosine because it makes 2 other stimulatory trace amines that tyrosine can't, and it can be converted to tyrosine anyways.

Black pepper, 1/2-1 tsp on an empty stomach with your medicine, decently strong MAOI but doesn't raise blood pressure, also has endocannabinoid enhancers, vasodilators, and it inhibits p-glycoprotein which is like a small pump on cells that pushes out chemicals it deems unsafe, one of the reasons for amphetamine tolerance is upregulated p-glycoprotein meaning less makes it into the cell.

Ginkgo biloba: boosts nitric oxide in blood, dilates brain blood vessels, increase tyrosine hydroxylase (enzyme that turns tyrosine to l-dopa, l dopa gets converted to dopamine) 
Also is a pretty great nootropic, increases BDNF in different parts of the brain, it completely gets rid of that cold finger shaky feeling from stims

Small dose caffeine, like 25-50 mg if you arnt sensitive to its cardiovascular effects, boosts cholinergic activity in the brain. Adenosine is another chemical that inhibits dopamine release, so blocking some of it increases the dopamine release from amphetamine, in my case by quite a bit",1711929681.0

If this kind of situation happens to you somewhat frequently, and it feels normal that men try to prey on you, then this means that evil men find that you make s good prey. Perhaps you seem innocent, naive, young. Perhaps you don't project a lot of confidence or don't seem to identify threat. Perhaps you are a natural flirt or tease and dont even intend to do that. Evil people can detect those things and target you. I'm not saying it's your fault at all. I'm saying take some time to analyze  how you can project more confidence and self esteem so that they don't try to prey on you. 

If you're not going to make a move on someone, don't tell them you think they are attractive! This can be interpreted as encouragement or leading them on. You probably don't intend this, but this is how you dig yourself a hole. If they're cute but you won't do anything, look, keep a poker face, move on.

"XCOM2","t5_38gcp","It should be 7 with the avatar, so you probably just forgot one. I'm probably repeating what everyone else has said at this point, but I do think that swapping a specialist out for a different unit will do a whole lot for you. 
I'd recommend a grenadier because the shred ability is so so important. Their last abilities are also insanely useful in the final fight. Rupture makes killing the avaters much easier, while saturation fire makes for excellent crowd control. Their holo targeting also makes landing hits on avatars easier.

As for the forgotten unit, it should ideally be either a ranger, templar or reaper. All three are great, but I think reapers are a tad harder to play than the other two, so I'd choose one of the others since you're new. Rangers and templars are both great for focusing down one enemy so are amazing against avatars. The main difference is that the rangers have more damage capability but are more squishy, whereas the templars trade off some damage for durability. Either should work.

Without seeing your loadouts and skill choices, it's hard for me to give more detailed advice, but one thing I would seriously recommend is making use of those 6 tower-like structures in the final room. The aim bonus from high ground is huge. Try to get your sniper, grenadier, and whoever has the warlock's rifle up there. Grenadier shreds and holo-targets, sniper deals big damage, and the warlock rifle will always crit avatars.
Have a go and see how you feel. I'm sure you'll get there eventually! Good luck!",1711929682.0

"ChineseLanguage","t5_2qyz1","My teacher was from China and a native speaker, however, his Ph.D. was in Physics. As a result, he didn't know how to teach the language. We used one set of books an after a year, and then switched the New Practical Chinese Reader (NPCR). We went through the books chapter by chapter, doing most of the workbook exercises, too. I got through 3 volumes (which is a decent amount of vocabulary), and my reading and writing was actually quite good. And yet I decided to call it quits. Why?

* We did not spend any time working on speaking and listening conversations.
   * I talked with a professor of another language - who has his Ph.D in said language and has written & translated many books. He said that he spends 20+ minutes at the beginning of every class just making his students speak in that language. He would only have them use simple vocabulary and added on as they became more advanced and fluent.
   * To me, this is/was my #1 struggle. We never spent any time like this, so I can read and write, but I can only speak haltingly at best.
   * When us students would ask when we're going to focus on conversational Chinese, his answer was always, ""you don't have enough vocabulary yet. You need about 5-6 years of study."" That was a bad answer because we could have had conversations using more limited vocabulary (and we knew a lot by year 3).
* NPCR is pretty good, I guess, but it seems geared to the student studying and living in Beijing. While the lessons on making doctor appointments, or renting an apartment were interesting, there wasn't a lot of applicability to ordinary conversations.

Note that this was Adult Continuing Education at a local college, not a bunch of young adults.

P.S. My wife and her family are Chinese, but it would be very hard to practice with them. They learned Mandarin in the 1950s/60s. Things are quite a good deal different now. They've told me that my ""accent"" is more accurate and better than theirs. Also, they primarily speak Shanghainese or Cantonese.

P.P.S. I'm open to anyone that has any suggestions for getting back to language learning, with the proviso that it *must* include either group or one-on-one speaking in Mandarin. It also has to be coupled with a real course & methodology. I tried things like Duolingo, and it's not all that great for me - and it's far too basic.",1711929682.0

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

>‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ôº∏ What does this mean?

>‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

>‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

The grand touring headlight (the LED one) is a different shape, so you would need a new bumper and grille, as well as some sort of adaptor harness to connect it to your car. 

Best bang for buck upgrade for your halogen bulbs is trimming the tabs of an H9 bulb and placing it in the low beam. It will give about 80-90% of the LED headlight output, while costing roughly $20. 

I've done in past cars, and it is night and day. It has the distance and brightness. The only thing is that the color is a yellow-ish hue. 

If you wanted an aftermarket LED bulb, the Morimoto 2stroke 3.0 is a good choice (there is Tacoma forum, and a guy named ""Crashburn"" that extensively tests OEM and aftermarket lighting solutions).",1711929683.0

Hi there,

This is kind of a random thing I don't know if I'm alone in experiencing. I have terrible body-focused anxiety. I've been struggling with eating disorders all my life. I have zero confidence in public spaces due to the current size of my body. I'm trying to lose weight to feel confident because I want to travel again.

I've only been overseas once and I was at a much lower weight so felt more comfortable and confident. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has ever gone through something similar? Were you still able to enjoy the travelling?

I think I bought mine at Macy‚Äôs, but Va Bien is available at a lot of different places. They have their own website, too. Just Google it, and you‚Äôll see a bunch of stores & websites that carry it. I know they make it in back sizes up to 48! It has three sets of hooks in back for size adjustment. 

This bustier is super supportive! It actually saved me from worrying about popping out of my dress on my wedding day. I wanted to lose 50 pounds in the year before the wedding, which I did. I got really frantic, however, with about 10 days to go, and lost more weight than I meant to. This was after the final fitting and alterations, so the top of the dress was a bit loose. (I ended up losing 57 pounds, and I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù.) The female photographer had to keep pulling up the front of my dress every time I sat down and got back up again. Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt get many opportunities to sit down during the ceremony or reception. You‚Äôll be busy going table to table with guests when you‚Äôre not dancing, cutting the cake, tossing the bouquet, etc. It all goes by very quickly!

Please learn from my experience, and don‚Äôt attempt lose a large amount of weight before your wedding. In hindsight, I should have planned to lose no more than 15 pounds. On your actual wedding day, you‚Äôre going to feel like a princess! You‚Äôll be wearing this beautiful dress and jewelry; your hair, makeup, and nails will all be done‚Ä¶ Everyone always talks about how stunning the bride is!

2. Remove Beelzemon X.  Since you don't play its Option, it's not worth Trashing for evolution, plus Ogudomon already trash the 5 Security. He's a brick. Replace it with a Leviamon X, since that one has better options to control the field
3. Play 3 or 4 Lillithmon, she is one of the best card to keep the Opponent's Digimon at bay (Its effect to keep her in the Area is not only limited to Deleting your Digimon)
4. Play only one Barbamon since it is the worst of the 7 Demon Lords (Very rarely you will summon something due to its effect and the only thing it does is Trash a card from the Opponent's hand)
5. Play a copy of the old Belphemon Rage Mode, since if you play it with Sleep Mode (to defend yourself). You can do a Board Wipe at all Levels 5 or lower at the Start of your Main Phase
6. Rival's Barrage does more harm than good because you want the greatest number of Digimon options to place on the Gate
7. If you want, add a Ruin Mode. Its Digivolve cost will be high, but it will give you two free turns to form the Gate

One thing I learned from this Deck are three interesting things:

* The options that has the \[Seven Great Demon Lord\] Trait can be placed in the Gate
* The Gate has its effect of reducing Play Cost as something optional. You can reduce costs between 0,3,4, 6-12
* For the fourth \[Seven Great Demon Lord\] Card in Gate, you can reduce the costs up to 11",1711929684.0

2. Your post has been reported to the mods for being a blurry, low-quality picture, per rule 6:

> The subject of a screenshot should be clearly visible in the image. That means blurry pictures taken from a phone or low-resolution images are subject to removal.

Instead of removing your post, I'll offer some advice, to avoid this in the future:

Kindly consider learning how to take a screenshot. Instructions at: https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/

Also, pressing F12 (by default) in Steam produces a screenshot.

You may also consider free products like Greenshot that are specifically designed for easy cropping and sharing.

http://getgreenshot.org/

Additionally, there are many free screen recording products: https://learn.g2crowd.com/free-screen-recorder-software

There's also the age-old classic of hitting print screen, pasting the image into a free paint program (I'm very fond of GIMP myself, https://www.gimp.org/ ), cropping to the part you want, and using that.

Alt+print screen will screenshot only the active window and not everything else.

Win+print screen will take the screenshot and autosave it in your pictures folder as screenshot number.png",1711929685.0

I've had similar experiences but thankfully always at GA shows where I was able to move away from the person. Not possible at a seated event, unless you really advocate for yourself and ask they either remove that person or re-seat you. I don't mean to imply you *should* have done that or have any blame in how that went down, just want everyone to be empowered with it as an idea in the back of their head. It is totally okay to make a big deal about something like this. You deserve to enjoy your show, and it's your absolute right to expect your safety to be taken seriously and protected by the venue and its staff. 

Again, so so sorry. I really hope your next concert experience is magical.",1711929686.0

Alonso may or may not be gone & I know this team needs a power hitter of his caliber & he drives in a ton of runs, but this core clearly isn't doing much together either. We have a ton of young promising guys & I hope some/most pan out because this team needs a new identity. I don't know if Eric Chavez is the hitting coach this team needs, either.

The top 10-15 college teams could probably handle paying athletes, I also believe them when they say the majority of programs could not.

The reality is the top programs need teams to beat up on. They need people in the wider ecosystem invested in the sport. What they don't want is to do anything that jeopardizes their position at the top which is why they make ridiculous statements like this even though they know how much revenue their individual program pulls in.",1711929687.0

They are not opposites like many think, but they are adjacent, at least emotionally speaking - they are both emotional reactions in excess. So when someone hates something, it's because they're still having an emotional reaction to the content, rather than being indifferent to it. The etiology of emotional reactions is unique to each person and has vast causes.¬†


TLDR: It has to do with Bowen's theory of differentiation in the field of psychology, basically.¬†


The less technical but also accurate answer is: they're blowing up right now, which has a lot of people exposed to them. Given that they do not behave or dress mainstream, it's bound to ruffle some feathers and label them as divisive. Another reason is they tend to act younger than they are, which society tends to dislike for men. People have many reasons for emotionally reacting to things - the list is endless - but that's probably the main reasons why.¬†",1711929687.0

Timmy doesn't have a penis but plays with all the other boys and uses he/him pronouns. As far as your nephew would be concerned, Timmy is a boy. 

My son had no issues. It was just another adjective to him. It described the people he was around. Boy and girl are not the same as male and female to a kid. Adding nonbinary is just other new information. Like what comes after 10 or how to make the color green or who George Washington was.

It‚Äôs not a competition, but I think firefighters in countries like Poland, Britain, the USSR, Germany, and Japan had it really bad.

Bombers would attack with incendiaries and turn cities into firestorms. They‚Äôd also drop high-explosive bombs that blew the roofs off of houses and factories, and sometimes destroyed the water mains. Then a second wave of bombers would come in, deliberately timed to kill the firefighters. There‚Äôd also be high-explosive bombs on delayed timers, so they‚Äôd be going off even after the bombers had left.

"Destiny","t5_2qnvz","They're not ""useless"" they help a very severe and chronic issue in society today and that's loneliness. You meet a lot of elderly widows with little white dogs because they're very charismatic, cuddly, lightweight and easy to manage especially because they don't need to walked often. 

You see young couples adopting a dog for the first time to gently introduce the idea of nurturing a life together in case they want to have kids. 

You see a lot of lonely young men who struggle with depression, who don't feel like they have anyone they can trust to be open around. Adopting a dog often helps these men feel like they have more responsibility to commit to someone other than themselves. It can make them feel more accomplished and less lonely. They may not have a therapist that understands the innermost depths of their emotions, but they have an adoring and loyal little animal that can put a smile on their face and make them feel loved. 

The idea that enough dogs are going around biting and killing people to a point where we shouldn't adopt dogs anymore, sounds like a brain-dead wannabe pseudo-intellectual take that I can't imagine you actually believe. Even the overwhelming majority of Pitbulls and german Shepherds or any other potentially dangerous dog, are not biting and killing people. By this logic both the number of people killed and the pollution (such a fucking stupid argument, kill me) cars should've been banned before dogs were even mentioned in this conversation. 

I literally just shattered my fucking leg by tripping over outside and now I'm in hospital. That's more damage done to me, than any dog has ever done, and I've spent my life around multiple dogs of all breeds. I'm not gonna put out the 30IQ take that we should ban walking outside in case we trip over. Funnily enough more people die from tripping over than they do dog bites lol.",1711929688.0

"Decks","t5_2xc5h","I finished wood furniture for a living for many years. We would sand with a course grit, but never a fine grit before staining. We also blew off the furniture with an air compressor to get rid of the particles.

We had to be careful not to sand too much, however, because it would close the grain. A light sanding opens the grain, but you could tell whenever someone sanded too much, because you'd have a lighter area. I'm sure the same is true for a finer grit, which we never did for this reason.

Although I don't have much experience with using water to open the grain, I'm sure that works, too, although I'd still sand it a little to get rid of the rough spots water would create. Sanding might not be important for a deck (idk), but furniture is expected to have fine finishes.",1711929688.0

En tied√§ miss√§ kiven alla olin el√§nyt kun kyn√§rist√§ en mit√§√§n aiemmin tiennyt, mutta nyt on 3000h tunteja steamissa alla ja faceit lvl8 saakka p√§√§sty (eli pelin learning curven huoioon ottaen ihan vasta-alkaja)

Todella iso henkireik√§ pelist√§ tullut ja sit√§ kautta kymmeni√§ uusia kavereita, joista osa todella l√§heisi√§kin joiden kanssa tulee pidetty√§ yht√§ p√§ivitt√§in. Tuolla porukalla seurattiin finaalit ja oli kyll√§ tunteikkain urheilutapahtuma itselle koskaan. Kaikki t√§h√§n hetkeen johtava taustatarina on kuin k√§sikirjoitettu ja tuntuu edelleen jopa ep√§todelliselta 

2019 Aleksib johdatti pelinsis√§isen√§ johtajana t√§ysin suomalaisista koostuvan ENCEn totaalisen odotusten vastaisesti CS:n arvostetuimman turnauksen majoreiden finaaliin. Siell√§ tappio tuli sen hetkiselle selke√§lle ykk√∂sjoukkueelle Astralikselle. Pian t√§m√§n j√§lkeen Aleksi sai dramaattisesti kenk√§√§, mik√§ oli monien mielest√§ v√§√§r√§ p√§√§t√∂s, lopulta t√§m√§ ENCEn suomalaiskokoonpano hajosi kokonaan. Sen j√§lkeen Aleksilla on ollut kohtalaisen hyvist√§ suorituksista kokoonpanoihin n√§hden kivinen tie useassa ulkomaisessa organisaatiossa. OG:sta, G2.sta ja NIP:st√§ tuli kaikista l√§ht√∂passit. 

Nyt Navissa, josta kukaan realistisesti tuskin odotti edes top 4 joukkuetta majoreilla, puhumattakaan miten Aleksin pelaajista b1t ja iM odotuksiin n√§hden suorittivat turnauksen alussa, meni Aleksib voittamaan ensimm√§isen√§ suomalaisena koskaan major-finaalin.

Tofu, originating in China, is made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the curds into blocks, offering a mild flavor and varying textures. Tempeh, from Indonesia, is created by fermenting whole soybeans with a mold, resulting in a nutty, earthy flavor and a chewy texture. Tempeh is higher in protein, fiber, and vitamins than tofu and its fermentation process makes it more digestible. Tofu absorbs flavors well, making it versatile in a range of dishes, while tempeh is often used as a meat substitute due to its texture.

Sorry to hijack your post, but I think this kinda similar theme:

There‚Äôs a cousin of mine whose parents are extremely wealthy even before he was born. He‚Äôs a picky eater. I would think he is one because there‚Äôs an abundance of food all the time in his house; so his brain doesn‚Äôt even see food from ‚Äúopportunity cost‚Äù. If there‚Äôs any inconvenience of a slight taste on food that he‚Äôs having, he just throws it away. 

On the other hand: me, who came from a lower middle class family. Since young I was always told to ‚Äúclean my plate, don‚Äôt let food go to waste‚Äù. Fast food was like a cheat code to survive. Mom is a type of person who‚Äôd like to take food home whenever there‚Äôs an event.

It is only whe this massacres weren't effective enough or had too many difficulties (soldiers refusing to participate or breaking down afterwards, the difficulty of keeping them secret, etc.) when the Wannsee Protocol happened and the extermination camps were established.

You can't really read the dial numerically, so you have to memorize the correct position.

If you watch Paul's videos about the design of the gauge attachment, he points out that mounting on the arm allows both ends to move together: the gauge follows the piston, resulting in the minimum strain on the fitting junctions.

You responded however with ""Exactly, that's why you don't need to be pampered"" as if suicide is pampering? and said ""instead of chatting on reddit, which is a feminine ass activity"" encouraging sexism (even if you're a woman you still use it in a negative manner correlating a negative behaviour to female activities smh).

They should also add some red plants to the planted third. I recommend ludwigia and rotala, because it's very easy to turn them at minimum slightly pink. I've got rotala that is vibrant magenta with no injected CO2.

"backpain","t5_2rdud","Thank you for posting. A couple of things to note. (TL;DR... include specific symptoms/what makes your pain better/worse/how long)... MRI or XRAY images are not particularly helpful tbh, no one here has been vetted to make considerations on these or provide advice, here is why, PLEASE read this if you are posting an MRI or XRAY... I cannot stress this enough https://choosingwiselycanada.org/pamphlet/imaging-tests-for-lower-back-pain/) 

Please read the rules carefully. This group strives to reinforce anti-fragility, hope, and reduce the spread of misinformation that is either deemed not helpful and even sometimes be considered harmful.

PLEASE NOTE: Asking for help: It is up to you to recognize when to seek medical attention. Anyone giving advice in this group is doing so from anecdotes and holds no liability. Seek advice at your own risk.

That said, asking things like, ""I have this problem, how do I fix it..."" is like asking your accountant, ""I have $10,000 what should I do with it?"" You need WAY more info before giving any kinds of financial advice. 

Please reply to this, or make another comment, including how long you've been having pain or injury, what are specific symptoms (numbness, tingling, dull/ache, it's random, etc), what makes it worse, what makes it feel better, how it has impacted your life, what you've tried for treatment and what you've already been told about your back pain, and what do you hope to get from this forum.

PLEASE NOTE: MRI or X-Ray help: If you have submitted an MRI or XRAY image and are looking for feedback on imaging. A couple of things to note about imaging. 

First, no one here is truly qualified to give you feedback on your imaging. So take everything with a grain of salt.

Second, symptoms are not well correlated or causative from imaging alone and should proceed with hesitation regarding findings of things like herniated/bulging disc, DDD, stenosis, arthritis, spondy, because they are not all death sentences. Please refer to this website for more information on the need for imaging. MOST cases of low back pain will not need imaging right away. https://choosingwiselycanada.org/pamphlet/imaging-tests-for-lower-back-pain/

FINALLY and most importantly, red flags such as (history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, fever, recent infection, loss of bowel or bladder control, and abnormal reflex findings with loss of muscle power or feelings in the legs) all warrant imaging and immediate follow up with MD and in some cases a trip to the emergency department, WHICH NO ONE IN THIS GROUP CAN ACCURATELY RECOMMEND. Please seek medical attention if this is you. 

Please be kind to each other. Be respectful. Thank you.

Either he returned to stop thawne or he got back to his time, but not both, at least for me that doesn't make sense, so (for me) flashpoint barry shouldn't have vanished (another question is what would have happened to barry's consciousness, either one of the two barrys, who would've become barry S3, and if he replaced S1 barry, what would have happened to that flash and the thawne who was going to go back to the future)",1711929693.0

1) Raise class consciousness and awareness (through discussion and education)

2) Organize locally with other socialists/communists, helping to build foundations for mutual aid

3) Unionize your workplace

4) General strike


Also, vote in local elections you can have a real impact there.

As for #1, my recommended intro reading list:

The principles of communism - Engles

Socialism utopian and scientific - Engles

The state and revolution - Lenin

There's also a ton of good YouTube content if that's more your thing ( but you really should read the foundations of theory as well), highly recommend these channels as a good starting point:

But having nice looking hair can help improve someone's social status. It can affect our self esteem, our sense of belonging if we wear¬†a hairstyle that the people around us like, or negatively impact our self-esteem is to use one that they actively dislike. What we do with out hair makes a statement about who we are and how we relate to others, whether we are consciyof it or not. And¬†belonging to a social group is very important for survival.



It's possible that even in the paleolithic era, our ancestors had haircare routines that helped them to conform to beauty standards of the day, even if that's just rinsing it off in a river frequently and combing through it with our fingers, or rubbing some animal fat into our hair as conditioner when our hands happened to be greasy from eating meat, or any other natural source of oil they found back then.


Hair gets damaged whether you cut it or not. It's wear and tear that causes the damage, and if it's got enough damage then it breaks off.


Having hair that is relatively undamaged and has cleanly trimmed ends is easiest for people who live a life that's sheltered from hard labor, a life of privilege.

From our club, other clubs, anywhere. It‚Äôs not just football, but it‚Äôs like a little sample of the world as a whole. Racism, bigotry, delusion on ridiculous scale, tribalism over fuck all.

"BlatantMisogyny","t5_2obn7g","I think it's silly to say feminists need to be organizing against circumcision. Feminists organize for womens' issues - men run the world and they can organize for their own issues.

That said, I do think there's an argument to be made that feminists who don't at least condemn circumcision via words are giving them fodder. I know this line of thinking can slip into respectability politics really easily, so I want to be careful with it, but it does seem, to me, to feed the MRA narrative that feminism is about ""oppressing"" men, rather than just taking away their power.",1711929695.0

"PhotoshopRequest","t5_2u2ui","Hello u/howdyanna, thanks for posting on /r/PhotoshopRequest! Please note:

- Do not work with anyone who did not comment publicly on your request. If anyone contacts you privately about your request, simply ignore them. If you have a request for which you do not want to post the image(s) to be edited publicly, please provide as much detail as possible about the request and ask that interested editors reply to your post. From there, you can vet the editors who reply by viewing their comment histories and reach out privately to whomever you'd like to work with. Again, **do not respond to any direct private messages about your request.**

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

Even a single millimeter under your foot changes your gait, and muddles proprioception.

""Barefoot shoes"" is an oxymoronic phrase.

&nbsp;

Some quotes from The Infinite Race:

***Silvino Cubesare (Raramuri farmer & international ultrarunner):***

""I don't know what they're thinking. Why do they do this?""

""Why do they want to run barefoot? It seems strange. Why do they want to suffer? I think they're crazy""

***Irma Chavez (Raramuri activist):***

""[...] It's a mockery of us. Because the people that are doing it, don't have a need to do it. Nevertheless, **the Raramuri people do it because we lack resources.""**

***ESPN 30 for 30: The Infinite Race*** - the spiritual successor to / the truth and reality behind that bullshit book ""Born to Run"" - the demystifying of / the de-exoticizing of / the **re-humanizing** of the Tarahumara people.

Think of it like this: you are likely worse off driving an old car hard because things are worn out, but your brand new CX-30 is certainly capable of putting down a 10 second 0-60 and it shouldn't be hurting anything at all. Especially if your engine is at temp. You are actually seating many of the components in the engine into their final resting place very well when doing this, and that's not a bad thing.¬†

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","The [Prospecting Deck](https://boardgamegeekstore.com/products/western-legends-prospecting-deck?_pos=3&_sid=5d21c27dc&_ss=r) is a direct counter, limiting the number of nuggets and rotating which mines pay out the best. It's easy to balk at $15 for only 16 cards, but if your games are being entirely warped around a miner, it is well worth picking up.

There can be some fantastic rewards on the Buzzard Gulch map with the Frontier tokens, and while those have their own balance issues--getting the Upgraded Mount early leads to an absurd advantage--it draws focus into the the new content, like the enhanced story cards Really, that is where a lot of the balance seems to come from: presenting the players with so many options that I've found people naturally try different things. More than direct counters, it is the open world opportunities that draw people away from the mining loop. It is just so boring, why do it for 3 hours straight? When teaching the game, I stress that the real joy in it comes from the *stories* we will be creating, and that I've enjoyed my times with it coming dead last as much as first when I've gone into it looking for narrative fun. 

I also encourage people to pick counterpoints as characters--when playing with 6, I try to have 2 Outlaws, 2 Marshalls, and 2 Neutral that may drift either way, and characters like gamblers who like to hang around town with ranchers that do better out on the range. That mix and chat before the game even begins is what sets the stage for our shared favorite plays.",1711929698.0

Yeah it sucks, but you've gotta understand, able people will never, ever comprehend or be able (ha) to grasp what we go through. The person you spoke with sounds privileged, but frankly they also sound miserable. If she's so successful, why is she arguing with a disabled person on reddit? Why feel the need to preach about how hard she's had it? Honestly, if she *isn't* miserable, then she's a top tier troll and she's taking the piss. But it sounds like she is miserable - maybe she's got people who shit on her in her daily life, maybe she's got some wild disability that others don't recognize, hell maybe she's just an entitled boomer. Nobody of sound mind feels the need to hop on reddit and tell the world how great they are and put others down, and are you really gonna let someone like that bug you so bad? Just ignore her, take it on the chin, don't engage. They won't get it, and even if they could, it wouldn't matter - a miserable person doesn't give a rat's ass about empathy or commiseration, they just want other people to be miserable too. 

As for your plight, I get it. I was halfway through undergrad when my ""I get bad sleep some nights"" very rapidly turned into ""I cannot function as a human"" and I've been hanging on by a thread ever since. Two extra years in a school I never really wanted to attend, thousands of dollars pissed down the drain, and parents who never even almost cared to understand. Several friendships decayed, relationship nearly ended, job lost. Now I'm stuck, because I need an internship to graduate and somehow newspapers and broadcast stations don't want a reporter who will randomly shut off. 

I imagine most people here have similar stories - we'll understand. So, if you need to vent, vent here. If you need to be mad, be mad here. But don't argue with ableists, man. They're not worth getting upset over, and they'd only enjoy the fact that they made you upset anyway.

"alasjuicy","t5_3jmny","Please no. Hatid sundo rin ako like you. Inis nga ako kasi even after college strict parin kaya I was so happy ning unang job ko, na assign ako sa province so no choice sila. I graduated virgin, and I was proud of it. Pero ayun, after nung malayo ako and thought I was free, ginawa ko yan. 2013 ung 1st. 2023 ung last. For 10yrs I was doing hookups. Was it happy, was it great? Oo, siempre masaya during, pero believe me, mas grabe ung void na na create nya sakin. Ung void na never will be filled. Void na mas lalo lang lumalaki instead of healing. Nag spiral lang lahat. From depression, suicidal, lahat2x.

Ung parents natin, they know what's best, yes totoo to. I hated them for this, even now my resentment pako, pero I'm grateful and na realize ko na rin na as a age, na they were right. Context lang on how strict there are, they would get my phone after school, kaya i really need to delete everything everyday. They had all my passwords to my soc medias. Wala lang silang magawa since ang work ko is lageng out if Manila, pero still they can see everything and would call me to stop.

Pero ayun, this is for you to decide, kasi tbh, i wont be who I am right now, if I haven't experienced those rock bottom life. I'm 8mos hook up free now, can say no to parties and alcohol.

By the way, i live in Boracay, digital nomad ako, mag 1yr nako this dito yr.. used to think of mag pa ""lutang lutang nalang sa dagat"".. used to be a student (joke since daily akong nandun) of Epic, Ombar..

And I'm living the better version of me now since I stopped those. (Pero doesn't mean wala naakong problems ha), mas mentally and emotionally stable lang.. super happy rin to meet a community here na puro from MNL rin and have stayed na dito sa island, and are also trying their best to be better versions of themselves..

Alternatively you could pay for cdl school, or some certs in non destructive testing. Maybe join a trade apprenticeship, any trade would work, but electrical or plumbing preferred. All of these are jobs that will give you a decent quality of life and employment almost anywhere. Good backgrounds for getting into a cushy plant job eventually.

Specifically, I'd like you think about his reason for not blocking your ex-friend. 

""It's entertaining to see you fall out""

...
To be fair, there shouldnt be any questions left after this. If I didnt know any better I'd say it was almost psychotic behaviour. When a person whom youre close with is having a fight with anotger important person, what are your priorities?

A: make sure the person feels as good as possible and potentially offer advice

Or

B: Enjoy the chaos

...its just not right if thats the nr.1 thing on his mind, but in  the end you call the shots. 

I think to say they're in a relationship is a bit of a stretch. Maybe they just kept in touch, but its not a stretch to say that imo, they're both pretty toxic people.

When you hit a low, this is not the type of behaviour that occurs in healrthy relationships. You dont just leave the person when they need you the most or enjoy the mess they're in. Thats almost mockery.

But you're free to draw your own conclusions. I hope you find a way through this. Have a great day/night/whatever",1711929699.0

Hell, Biden has already been dragged through the mud on this whole Gaza thing to the point where I know leftists in my circle who won't ever vote 'for genocide joe'.

Meanwhile Trump has had so many scandals that nothing phases his voter base.

"CharacterRant","t5_35frv","For me it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs a justification that I have a problem with, it‚Äôs that reducing a villain‚Äôs motive to like one single traumatic event is to me overly neat and simplistic.

It just feels overly flat and cartoonish to me to present such a straightforward chain of causality. Like this one event happened therefore this is my motive now. People are more complex than that. 

It‚Äôs not even like it‚Äôs hard to present a chain of causality that‚Äôs more fleshed out and realistic either. An example of this that comes to mind is O-Ren Ishii‚Äôs backstory in Kill Bill. A traumatic event kicks off the chain of events that leads her to become an assassin, but it‚Äôs just one event in the series of events that makes up her life and it‚Äôs not particularly relevant to her conflict with Beatrix nor is it relevant to her motives at the time they fight because O-Ren is a more complex person than that. Her parents being murdered in front of her is still a pivotal event that shaped the person she became, but all her actions aren‚Äôt reduced to or explained by her parents being murdered in front of her, especially since she got her revenge for that a long long time ago.",1711929700.0

1. If the corner plays zone on your #1 receiver and the middle LB is blitzing, just throw the slant. 

2. If the corner is playing press, audible to go route and read the safety. If the safety doesn't help on your #1 WR, throw the deep ball, and depending on the catch difficulty, you should be able to adjust safe catch/regular catch/ aggressive catch. 

3. If the MLB plays zone and the corner goes with your #1 receiver, you can just run it with your QB to the sideline. Make sure if you get caught to get out of bounds or if you can't, just slide. So your QB doesn't get hurt or fumble. 

All three reads can be made on the quick slant. And that's only if you're reading the left side of the field. Obviously, you still have the middle and right to read if you want, but this will speed up your thought process. 

The more comfortable you're with different plays, the better you will play. It's why most rookie QBs get a simple playbook first, and they expand the playcalling as they learn the offense. 

Also, let the run game be your friend. If defenses are just playing heavy coverages, run the ball. You don't have to run a ton, but it at least keeps the defense honest.",1711929700.0

>!I'm almost certain that The Wanderer has done this exactly; it says at the end of Tongue Eater that she has a blue crystal eye, which I believe is aether crystal.!<

Iopan Scrying emphasizes the concept of limiting perception in useful ways - the ability to use different gemstones is advantageous because it allows the seer to filter their perception of the aether - it's possible that an aether crystal eye would be completely useless, since it stands to reason that a prosthetic eye made of aether crystal would have no filtering effect at all, so the seer would just see *everything*, which would probably be completely incomprehensible.

On the other hand if a seer had an **attuned** aether crystal eye, they might be able to selectively filter their perception of the aether, which would be incredibly useful - they'd essentially be able to see any part of the aether that they wanted, making their eye a one-size-fits-all solution to Iopan scrying.",1711929700.0

> Any other recommendations?

Anything in particular?

If just random:

* Ishura - dark fantasy
* Foolish Angel Dances with the Devil - comedy + urban fantasy action + romance
* Frieren - high fantasy that ranges from meditations on life to bursts of intense action
* The Apothecary Diaries - CSI meets House MD in the form of a gremlin poisons-obsessed girl in Imperial Not!China
* The Dangers in My Heart - possibly the best romance and romcom anime has ever produced",1711929701.0

I agree but, keep in mind that the rent market is propped up by desperate people trying to find a roof over their heads. At the same time the price of the flat (equity) is usually a multiple of the chargeable rent.

"Jujutsufolk","t5_47rbe5","Nanami was fighting a baby Mahito so saying he could defend himself effectively against the strongest form of Mahito is a bit iffy. The case for Yuta is a bit of a stretch because a sure Rika also played a big part in that. Plus, if Yuta can attack the soul the way doesn‚Äôt he do it all the time so his opponents can heal (are not heal as effectively in Sukuna‚Äôs case). Also, if Yuta can damage the soul then he probably would have done it against Sukuna and if that happened then we probably would‚Äôve gotten a few panels mentioning it. 

I doubt reincarnated sorcerers can see the soul just because their reincarnations. Yuji could see the soul because he was a vessel for Sukuna but that‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs going on with the reincarnated sorcerers. In Yuji‚Äôs case, he and Sukuna interact multiple times and even switch control of the body. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going on with the reincarnations, they subconsciously suppress the non sorcerers soul. Or maybe Kenjaku did it for them. If Kashimo could attack the soul then he probably would have done it to Hakari and easily won that fight. 

Maki and Toji do beat Mahito because of soul split katana but I put Mahito above them because he beats like every other character in the series with little difficulty, besides a hand full of characters like Yuji and Yuki.",1711929702.0

"Minneapolis","t5_2r3bl","I‚Äôm sorry, you are misreading. The statute has an ‚Äúor‚Äù which means there are two circumstances in which pedestrians have the right of way, which is crossing RJ roadway **either**
1. ‚Äúwithin a marked crosswalk.‚Äù **or**
2. ‚Äúat an intersection with no marked crosswalk.‚Äù

You seem to be misreading ‚Äúwith no marked crosswalk‚Äù as if it said ‚Äúwith a crosswalk that is unmarked.‚Äù But that‚Äôs not what it says. There is no requirement that there be any ‚Äúcrosswalk‚Äù at all if the pedestrian is at an intersection. 

The point is that if there is a marked crosswalk at a particular intersection, the pedestrian should be using that. Some intersections, for example, intentionally only have a marked crosswalk on one side in order to channel pedestrian traffic. If there isn‚Äôt a marked crosswalk, then the pedestrian is allowed to cross at the intersection however they would like.",1711929702.0

You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.

The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.

When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.

No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.

I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.

You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.

You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.

Even this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.

Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.

In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.",1711929703.0

"jhu","t5_2shup","As yet another JHU then NU grad‚Ä¶ 

Similarly, my info for JHU undergrad is dated, BUT I can‚Äôt imagine some things have changed a whole lot. I am a science guy (so take my advice with a grain of salt). However, pretty much everyone from my social circle is some sort of business major or professional now, and my impression is that NU is the better spot to go if your main objective is to *just* major in economics. If you were planning on double majoring with math, science, or engineering, then maybe JHU would be worth consideration because the diversification would allow you to tap into some of Hopkins other strengths. One of my best buds did BME/Econ and is a beast.

NU has a longer, stronger reputation for Econ and biz degrees, plus it feeds directly into the Chicago metropolitan job market, whereas with Hopkins you‚Äôll primarily have to aim for the surrounding metro areas, such as Philly, DC, or NYC. Hopkins has stronger name recognition on the east coast, but does not get the same respect in the Midwest. I imagine this goes for NU grads out east, by comparison. Getting a job in cities outside of where you study is obviously something people do every day, but man it can be a lot harder to get your foot in the door when you don‚Äôt have favorable local bias from alums on your side. 

Chicago gets shit on by a lot of people because it‚Äôs not as high falutin‚Äô in rep as NYC, or as ‚Äúglamorous‚Äù as LA, but it has a very good mix of income, career opportunities, and relatively low cost of living. Plus, some companies will pay NYC rates firm-wide, resulting in NYC income but in a much cheaper, but still very large and cultural city. Worst case, you rack up 2-3 years in a Chicago job, then make moves to somewhere more your pace. Lotta Chicago bias here. NU is also a bigger undergrad school with a more balanced academic layout, so your social networking could yield more people working in similar fields as you after you graduate.

Another long term bonus of NU and potentially working in Chicago after is that you‚Äôd have a pretty good setup for Booth, should you be interested in adding the MBA down the line. Pretty much no one beats Booth on the Econ angle.",1711929703.0

"SubaruForester","t5_2y78a","I have a 23 Forester Wilderness, my wife has a 23 Crosstrek Limited, and my Mother In Law has a 22 Outback Touring.
From WV, I‚Äôve driven/road in all three, Forester to Toronto, Outback to Maine, Crosstrek to Charlotte. So plenty of long road trip time in all three. 
The outback is great, if you‚Äôre driving or riding up front. To me, it is a little cramped in the back, but I am a pretty big guy, so take that as you will. Headroom is a little lacking as well. Driving is ok, but if you‚Äôve got knee problems, the center console completely divides the car at your waist when sitting, you‚Äôll very much be in a cockpit situation in it. 
Crosstrek is great. It‚Äôs a comfy ride. Plenty of room and more headroom than the Outback.
I‚Äôm probably biased, but my Forester kills the other two. Room, comfortability, cargo, legroom, all great. 
Driving all three is pretty much the same. 
Now, my dad has a 24 Ascent Touring and that thing is an absolute tank. A living room on wheels. I‚Äôve not driven it but riding in it is crazy comfortable. Especially with this ventilated seats. 
My mom drives a WRX.
Somehow we all ended up with Subarus. Car envy is a thing.

"flowarts","t5_2sccn","First of all, mood. You're not alone with the body image struggle! Despite not preforming professionally I triple check how I look in every video I take before showing them to anyone so I can only imagine stepping out in front of a crowd. I feel you.

Regarding what you said about skill level and being worthy - judging by this single post it sounds like you have a very perfectionist eye towards your act and yourself. From body and outfit through skill level and even up to coordination with other performers. While having a standard is - a) legitimate and b) admirable! you might want to ask yourself if your AUDIENCE wants the things you want from yourself, I'm sure you'd find their eye waaaaaaaaay is more forgiving than yours! 

Sometimes simpler tricks are more visually engaging, and generally any move that makes you feel good and enjoy would probably look good - maybe try starting from a less taxing and more enjoyable routine you can preform while developing a more complex one. From my experience with flowing and juggling in public - technical tricks and color coordination may be super important to us as artists but completely fly over ""normie"" heads.

About community - sometimes flowmies and especially your local flow ""influencers"" would make it seem like there's only one way to train, dress, book shows, etc I never got it and if you think about it gatekeeping ART / performance / self expression is so weird - In my local scene I know some people use their ""status"" to make sure they're the only ones to buy gear from or take classes from because everyone learns their way to do whatever as a standard.

"Jujutsushi","t5_445fo9","In this final arc, there are actually two parallel efforts ongoing in the fight against Sukuna:

1. Rescue Megumi from Sukuna

2. Outright defeat of Sukuna 

- Narrative-wise, it was never Yuji‚Äôs role as a cog to defeat Sukuna. Yuji‚Äôs ‚Äúperfect ending‚Äù, as in the words of his grandfather, was to ‚Äúhelp people‚Äù and leave ‚Äúsurrounded by people‚Äù he cares about. In the current arc, I believe his primary objective, as with the remaining of the JJK High, is to rescue Megumi. And it just so happened that Yuji is blessed with the ability to punch the gap between souls, making him the guy to separate them.

- Throughout the manga, Gojo has been hailed the strongest of them all in his generation, and his feats have matched his reputation. That was until Sukuna came along and even then, this was the guy that said ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôd win‚Äù in face of that. Gojo‚Äôs role in the plot has always been to become the strongest of them all, and that‚Äôs aligned to defeating Sukuna. While I‚Äôve seen some theories mentioning how he will come back through binding vow weakened and all, but I believe it will be otherwise: Gojo will come back even stronger, parallel to Sukuna and taking him down after Yuji rescues Megumi (there‚Äôs a previous theory here on how Gojo might get his power-up when he finally start using both hands to cast his domain expansion, as he is the only character to cast it with one hand, thought there might be some truth to it?).",1711929704.0

"appletv","t5_2s3df"," I have a 55"" G3, Pana UB820, Samsung Q930C setup. TG Maverick looks gorgeous and sounds immense from the 4k disc. The stream version on Netflix looks and sounds much less in every area, yes even the sound is not as punchy when the darkstar takes off, and the canyon scene planes doesn't sounds as brutal. But wheres the disc's pic bitrate alone  around 70-90mbit/sound 6-7mbit, on netflix it's 16-18 i think in total. It's obviously uncomparable. Disney+ and apple tv+ are a bit better in picture quality. Again netflix it's ¬£17/month and you can watch tons of content for the price of a film so I'm not trying to drag it down. Films in Dolby Vision on all of the stream services looks way darker in cinema/filmmaker mode then on their disc versions. 
4k disc Lotr boxset yes it looks and sounds absolutely incredible! In my opinion if you can afford to buy a top tier oled panel tv s95/g3/a95l etc or 1/2 gen older and a good quality sound bar/system... I highly recommend anyone to buy their favourite films on disc because it's absolutely worth it!

These artifacts can then be versioned, shared, and distributed through OCI-compatible registries like Docker Hub. This approach provides several advantages:  Encapsulating work in OCI Artifacts facilitates easier sharing among team members. Leveraging OCI registries for artifact storage introduces built-in versioning capabilities. Packaged artifacts can be seamlessly integrated into continuous integration and deployment pipelines, making the leap from notebook exploration to automated ML workflows less daunting.",1711929705.0

I have read about extraction colonialism. One of the key aspects of extraction colonialism is that it's to the detriment of the locals and forced upon them by outsiders. This was simply not the case with the Nanban trade where the Japanese had full control of their resources and got the full benefits from the trade. 

You're forgetting the part where a Portuguese smith was brought over to teach firearm manufacturing.

Your personal soul will change throughout your life; whether you like it or not shouldn‚Äôt be your concern, in fact, you should be proud as a change such as that is the gateway to the next chapter of your life. The quicker you come to accept the new and not worry about the past the quicker you can get to the absolute point of your life and be happier than before. You ARE having your life, it‚Äôs just not a part you have came to accept part of it yet. And that‚Äôs fine. You don‚Äôt have to bash yourself for that!

About 70% less tips DESPITE 80% of the customers giving me 5 stars & compliments.  It doesn't make sense.

We'll see what happens with 360, but fuck, the base pay for S&D's is LESS than curbsides with the other app, and almost half of what S&D's are.  Only we see pre-tips on the other app, and at least for me tip baiting is rare.

It's totally market dependent, I'm sure.  We only have Target S&D's, and pickups at a couple other stores that are literally only a few times a month.

Still, $50-$150/wk for an hour or two of work is definitely better than the other app, but there's no volume.  Even when I was fighting being deactivated and ran Uber & Shipt I wasn't making shit and was far more stressed.

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we want post titles to be more descriptive to make it easier for people to know if they might be able to help or not without opening each post.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the music recognition bot(s) in our [Weekly Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/about/sticky?num=2) (this link might only work in a browser)

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era/Year | Genre | Style | Artist type (or name if you know) | Music video information | Source name`  
`Language/Country | Lyrics/Content | Cover art | Description | Possible (or known) song name`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.).
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`When relevant you can also use:`

  - I only remember the melody that I recreated here
  - I only have this recording, don't know any details

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ... by ...? [add the actual details]
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ... by ... [add the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ... by ...?

Thank you and good luck :)

It may show in match history, but not in post game lobby. I recall to have 20 mejai stacks at the end of a game and it didn't show them in post lobby. It it shows the stacks, shouldn't Varus mejai show the number 0?




Anyways is pretty hard to imagine Varus ended with no mejai stacks on a win having 18 Kill Participation. Anyways dosn't matter.




Full mejai is 175 AP. Rabaddon is 100 AP + 45% of total AP. So in total you get 400 AP.




20% of 400 AP is 80. So Varus autottacks deal 80 extra dmg + 24 base dmg. That is 104 dmg + Varus base autottack dmg (118). This 104 dmg DOUBLES when W is activated, this means that it deals 208. In total each autoattack deals 326 dmg of hibrid dmg. This will increase if he have conqueror and also there are a lot of runes that give more AP. I also can't see the boots. It may have the magic penetration ones.




But AP Varus main source of dmg is not autoattacks, it's W pasive stacks (Blight). Each stack deals deals 6.5+(1% of AP) magic dmg. This means that with those 400 AP he will deal around 10% Max Health per stack, just by Blight. So if you do: W aa aa aa R (the ulti adds 3 Blight stacks after 1 second) E aa aa aa Q, you apply 9 stacks of Blight. Thats 90+% of Max Health magic DMG. This 90+% of Max Health dmg is ignoring the 326 dmg from each auto, the R dmg, the E dmg, the Q dmg and the 8% to 16% of the enemy missing health on Q (shown in W pasive) dmg. So with this ""troll"" build you are able to oneshoot a tank if you hit the full combo. And you still have good DPS after and decent low cooldowns with Hearthsteel 20 hability haste, so you will recover Q very fast. Get tank items helps you to survive enought to do the full combo without having peel in a champion as vulnerable as Varus against their team full of treaths. So no¬† the build is not troll, is probable a better build than you will ever cook in your life xD",1711929706.0

"DID","t5_2s73v","For us, it really all depends on the day, where we are, who we are with, and/ or what is going on with our mental health at that point. 

Times we dont worry about who is out: I am the current host, so all of our friends expect my personality unless they have met some of the other members and know how to tell us apart. At work, we all have the same demeanor and mannerisms, so it is like we are all using the same mask (we hate calling it this as it is more of a different side of our personality we bring to focus, but that is how others see it). Around our family (parents mostly) we don't feel safe letting know when there is a switch as they punished us when we were little for things that were a nautral part of DID, and even thought they ""got rid of C"" by scolding her and yelling at her {all it did was teach us that we had to hide who we are and had to pretend to be someoneand something we arent or we would get abused more}. Around my husband's family (legal husband but partner to a few of us), we mask because we don't know how they will react to it and it would hurt if they thought differently about us because of it. 

Times we do focus on who is out: C and 1 or 2 others are better at dealing with the symptoms of our ADHD so on really bad days, or when we don't have meds, they will step in and get things done. When my depression is flaring up badly, some of the others who dont have the same triggers will help out. At home, when it is just us and the husband/partner, and/or when we are trying to work through some of our traumas with our therapist who specializes in DID we naturally try to ensure there is  some focus on knowing who is out. Also, when we have been rapid switching between several of us, there needs to be a moment of stopping and thinking about who is out as the gatekeeper will even lose track... and normally, I am the one who ends up not knowing who the heck I am at that point, but I use 2 simple questions to figure it out (what is my favorite candy and who is my favorite video game character).",1711929707.0

"lioneltrains","t5_3gbpg","Long locomotives and trains get bound up in curves.  If you are running large scale locomotives around tight radius curves, expect them to slow down and/or stop if your curves are too tight for the locomotive. Additionally, the pickup rollers on large locomotives may be spaced far apart and start losing contact on tight curves. I suspect you are running things that are too large for your curves.

This is a feature and not a bug - it happens on real railroads too.  In fact, it can be an important aspect of controlling trains on steep grades. 

If you only have one track connection, of course the train will always run faster near the transformer - track has resistance so there is an increasing voltage drop the farther you get from the transformer.  Feeder wires from the transformer to far track sections can help - use larger gauge wire such as copper speaker wire for this.  Large layouts may connect every 2nd or 3rd piece of track to a feeder bus. 

**NEVER** connect your track or trains directly to house mains voltage at an outlet; it is incredibly stupid to do so.  You will electrocute yourself, start fires, and permanently destroy your trains.  A 0-16VAC toy transformer MUST be used.",1711929707.0

[Several developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps.

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. Limiting your involvement with Reddit, or
2. Temporarily refraining from using Reddit
3. Cancelling your subscription of Reddit Premium

About the difference between ◊†÷µ and ◊†÷∂, it could be that with the ◊ë◊†◊ô that follows the ◊î◊†◊†◊ô, the nikud conveys a balancing between the two semantics, as ÷µ leads to a shorter lingering on the consonant compared to the ÷∂.

I've posted about my introduction to him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pagan/comments/1be9pf4/comment/kus4u1z/?context=3&share_id=el8QD_ROEuLujI0FiQfbd&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) that you might find helpful. 

In my experience, Set is loud, boisterous, in-your-face, blunt, and extremely funny. He is incredibly kind and his love feels very fierce, forceful, and passionate like a sandstorm. His energy feels to me like heavy TV static falling onto my shoulders and the top of my head, and like he's standing behind me to support me. He feels protective as well. Set can be intense, but don't let that scare you, it's just how he is. I like his intensity. Set is also incredibly wise, empathetic, and patient. I have found that his guidance is very precise and to the point. He doesn't beat around the bush. 

Trickster deities are agents of change. They force the gods to change, which in turn gives them the opportunity to grow. Set‚Äôs murder of Osiris set off a chain of events--Isis's grief and perseverance in protecting her son and resurrecting her husband, Set challenging Horus forced him to become the leader he needed to be. This is UPG, but I see Osiris‚Äôs  murder as an act of love‚Äîthe dead needed a kind, just ruler to watch over them, and Horus needed to take Osiris‚Äôs place as king. 

Back to your question about reaching out to him. Just do what you usually do for deities--light a candle, say a prayer, leave an offering, and meditate (if you prefer) with the deity and ask Set to come into your life. In my experience, Set doesn't really care about offerings, but I have heard that he likes lettuce (I agree) and he seems to like cinnamon incense and scented candles, but that's all UPG. What Set really wants is what all deities want--for us to connect with them and to grow.",1711929710.0

I was looking for someone to play Purah from TOTK. As I don‚Äôt know much about the Legend of Zelda universe this rp doesn‚Äôt have to take place there. However I‚Äôm willing to do research if we decide to change our minds on that. Also plot details can be discussed in chat! So uh yeah, here‚Äôs the idea behind this post!!

Story: Purah had hit a wall with her research into how other species in the land reproduce. Apparently there was a multitude of factors when it came to reproducing. From eggs, using machines, or the male‚Äôs penis being vastly different from a humans, it seemed that the act of reproduction was vastly different from one  species to another. Or at the very least the mechanics of it. After running herself ragged for weeks, Purah had a brilliant idea. Instead of making, as she would call it, ‚Äúeducated guesses‚Äù Purah decided that if she wanted to learn more about how other species procreate, why not experience it firsthand. After all, that tall, strapping, and stunning looking friend of hers wasn‚Äôt exactly human. And most importantly, they were in possession of quite the breeding tool judging by that distinct outline Purah had spotted in her trousers once or twice. Besides, what‚Äôs the worse that could happen~

Second, and the real reason that won't work in my opinion, is that the straight side laminate will be too short to go around a radius.  You simply don't have enough material to work with.

Yes, kids say the Pledge of Allegiance on a daily basis in schools. Or they did when I was in school. I can‚Äôt promise they still do but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised by it at all. We don‚Äôt sing the national anthem regularly though. That‚Äôs just sports events really. 

Yes flags are all over. It‚Äôs pretty crazy how energy is put into displaying a flag. No other country does this. It is very strange. Flags are all over neighborhoods and car lots and random businesses. 

The US military is a very taboo subject. To most people, you can only say good things about it. Anything even remotely critical is met with the fury of a thousand suns. The way most Americans treat the military is ludicrous. It can‚Äôt do anything wrong. 

We learn practically nothing about other countries in school. Our education system is pretty bad compared to other modern countries.  I‚Äôm a bit embarrassed by it to be honest. 

Yea I‚Äôve left the country a few times. Been to Canada and to Iceland. That puts me in the minority. Most Americans never leave the country. I‚Äôve even considered moving to other countries.

When it's just me, the kids are generally little angels. I see them talking through conflicts without prompting, they respect my rules, they respect time out and understand why it's necessary as much as their little brains can...

But the second mom gets home, it all goes out the window. They're bouncing off the walls and furniture, punching everything and *everyone*, screaming at the top of their lungs (yano, that high pitch *screech* young kids can do)... She has no authority over them and she doesn't care.

Hell, once before leaving in the morning, her 4 year old (who stayed home from school *because it was raining*...wut) asked for one of those mini chip bags. Mom says, ""no, those are supposed to be for school, bud,"" AS SHE'S GRABBING A BAG, OPENING IT FOR HIM AND HANDING IT TO HIM. Without a second thought, literally simultaneously.

I have no hope for her kids because of her lack of parenting tactics. Their father is even worse...",1711929714.0

"sustainability","t5_2qjtc","If anyone wants to actually learn the real facts on [How recyclable solar panels are](https://www.epa.gov/hw/solar-panel-recycling).

The answer is that more than 75% of it is recyclable with work being done every day on improving that number. In fact, the generally accepted number now is 95%. There is actually very little non recyclable material in them, it is just that ECONOMICALLY it makes more sense to just go mine more.

This article says that the cost to recycle a panel can be as low as $10 per panel to recycle 95% of that material. This can and should be covered by government subsidy. This is why governments exist... to pool tax dollars and apply them in ways beneficial to society. 

Ask the NSW government how much money they spend on oil subsidies, and why $10 per panel is too much money? Not only is the government spending hundreds of millions or more on coal oil and gas subsidies, but the waste from that technology isn't ending up land fills, it's being released directly into the open sewer we call our air.

This is a symptom of our capitalistic consumption and throw away society, and impacts EVERYTHING. Nobody is talking about how gas stoves or refrigerators aren't recycled, even though roughly 75% of those devices are recycled. But not all of it is recoverable. Yet, this same issue of ""its cheaper to buy new than to recycle and fix"" exists for ALL THINGS in our throwaway society.

Make no mistake, articles like this are meant to cause misinformation around renewables, with an agenda to get us to consume more coal, oil and natural gas.",1711929715.0

"GenZ","t5_2tz25","But, and while I agree with you on toxic masculinity, I think it's important not to blanket approach issues like this. The reason I choose to argue over this is because I am in a position where it isn't a choice, and I know countless others in the same boat. We go out when we can, but it costs money and time which many do not have the luxury of, as well as, at least here, vehicles (unless you want to walk 10 or 20 miles), which many of us also do not have. 

I see this issue not as a choice people aren't making, but rather a choice many do not feel responsible making. If I take off work, that's food I may not have, and a source of income that could disappear. Be it illegal or not, workplaces are discriminating and coercive. If we want more friends, relationships, families, and so on we need time, money, and energy to find and build them. If I work a 12 hour night shift all week, I need the weekend to sleep, and the weekdays I'm not working to bank/run errands/ect, and then prepare to be up at 6pm to work until 5am again, and I, along with the majority of people I can personally point to cannot afford to live outside of our professions.

That‚Äôs made a huge difference for me. It also prevents hemorrhaging in the chest, so you bleed out less.

I find if you have a coordinated group, you very rarely get ambushed. When you know where the rockets are coming from, you can break contact and avoid dying to them. On foggy worlds, you can‚Äôt always avoid it, but the armour might then save you unless you‚Äôre getting shot by several at once, then you say your prayers to democracy and respawn. 

It‚Äôs the survivability onion. Follow that, and you won‚Äôt die as much to bots. Getting a good group together and getting good situational awareness will prevent needless rocket deaths.",1711929717.0

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","GRRM has openly explained that his ending will be widely different from the show's one, except for some fixed points (amongst them, Bran being king). As for his penchant for tragedy, it's very documented in his other books. He uses tragic tropes, yes, and he's very good at horror, but he's not into hopelessness, his conclusion are nearly always ethical in some way or  another, and he's not above being cheezy from time to time. He has constantly said he was aiming at a bittersweet ending, not at an hopeless one...

(And, by the way, Arya being the hero of the Long Night is something the showrunners have said many times to be their idea, and GRRM wrote clearly, when House of the Dragon was released, that the dagger with which she killed the Night King, was part of the show universe but not of the book canon (or, at least, not as an important thing).

Differences in plot points between the show and the books is pretty logical. Major subplots have been omitted from the show (LSH, fAegon, Dorne, Euron as a character practicing necromancy, Davos searching Rickon in Skagos, Loras seemingly wounded in Dragonstone, the Sand Snake acting against Cersei and Tommen, Varys killing Kevan as a conspiracy against the Lannister...). Whole themes - like the toxicity of vengeance and the importance of unity- has been discarded because ""themes are for nine graders"", and visually stricking scene replaced them. Some parts of the books has been adapted with a meaning opposite to what the books say. 

So, reverse engineering a partial and, after season 4, unfaithful adaptation can't really help to understand where Winds and ADOS would go if we get them. It's even the opposite ¬†¬†: if you try to do this after having read the books, and while taking into account all the plots going on, many things can't fit and you see that many parts of the endings and of the subplots from season 5 can't happen like they did in the show. 

That's why I totally disagree about your assesment of Cersei.

In the books, she's a secondary character, who got a POV only from AFFC, and only because GRRM needed 1/ a camera in King's Landing, 2/ to make how bad she rules credible by creating the Valonqar theory and  3/ to balance her POV, Jaime POV, and Brienne POV, in a not that subtle way (they're nearly always following each other, which says a lot about where he wants to go).

She's established not as a major villain, but as someone overestimating her skills at ruling and her cunning to the point of stupidity, from A Clash of Kings - see her first dialogue with Tyrio there.. She's also established as an uncaring/bullying mother (except with Joffrey), and as having no real love for Jaime - which making her a different person from her show counterpart. Her narrative purpose is to fail at ruling so quickly she'll give King's Lancing to fAegon. GRRM creates the Valonqar prophecy to accelerate her spiral towards when he had to renounce to the 5 years gap he initially planned between ADWD and Winds. Varys' manoeuvers to pit her and the Tyrells against each other, while effective, wouldn't have been enough to make her so weak so quickly.

All this is summed up, both in universe and in a meta way, in one of Littlefinger's dialogue (AFFC, Alayne II):

""You would not believe half of what is happening in King's Landing, sweetling. **Cersei stumbles from one idiocy to the next**, helped along by her council of the deaf, the dim, and the blind. I always anticipated that she would beggar the realm and destroy herself, but I never expected she would do it quite so fast. It is quite vexing**. I had hoped to have four or¬†five¬†quiet¬†years¬†to plant some seeds and allow some fruits to ripen, but now . . . it is a good thing that I thrive on chaos.** What little peace and order the¬†five¬†kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear.""

Once fAegon will get King's Landing, Cersei has no narrative purpose anymore, and is, indeed, discardable. She may die at this moment, or later, but she'll be a secondary character, with no link whatsoever the core of the plot - the fight against the Others- and no weight in the fight between Dany and fAegon. She'll have, indeed, lost everything.

About her ""love story"" with Jaime... that how the show painted it. Again, if you read the books, it's a caricature of a toxic love story, with Jaime realizing how one sided their relationship with, and Cersei realizing Jaime isn't who she thought he is. Their arc from ASOS to AFFC is very clearly a breakup -and, again, some scenes were adapted in the show with a meaning opposite of what the book tells (the most blatant being the White Tower scene - Jaime sends her away very coldly in the books, and he'll deny her again a second time in the Sept during Tywin's vigil¬†;  in the show, it's a passionate scene). The show made Jaime threaten the High Sparrow in order to help Cersei. In the books, his choice is to let her deal by herself with the consequences of her act, thinking that, anyway, she's guilty (of Robert's death). And the show never adaptated the Weirwood dream, that clearly states that she will die before him. 

To sum it up ¬†¬†: book Cersei and show Cersei are two different characters, and book Cersei is linked with many arcs (fAegon and Dorne) that the show didn't adapt. You can't shoehorn her arc in the show in the books' plot.",1711929717.0

As for our question about it affecting your car insurance or future mototcycle incurance then I don't know for sure. It may or may not affect your premiums. Normally it would but given that you were on a training day then I don't know if it would. However, I would definitely declare it at renewal of any car or motorcycle insurance. Companies look for reasons to reject a payout so in the future if you claim and haven't declared it then they may be able to use it as a reason to reject the claim. I was knocked off my bike by a careless car driver a few years ago and do declare that when renewing my car insurance. It hasn't noticably affected my premiums but it was a non-fault claim (the other party was at fault, not me). So it's possible that it might affect your premiums. If it were me then I would always declare it if renewing online but follow up with an email or phone call to the insurance company to check if it needed to be declared (or ideally check with them before renewing).",1711929718.0

Nothing about the carbon tax harms you in any significant way, groceries are just inflation and greed, farmers are 99% exempt except for transport, and anyone who pays attention will know the rebate is 3x what you spend to heat a house.

Price of fuel is iffy, certainly went up due to corporate greed and as a negative result of the tax, but hey, provinces (Alberta) are bringing back more and more fuel tax every few months, it costs more then the carbon tax does.

If people weren't so quick to fall for fancy taglines they wouldn't have this problem, but they (Conservative supporters ""sheep""), fell for it without even doing any research. Won't deny it's 80% Liberal fault for their ignorance and gullibility, they didn't give out enough info in 1-2 sentences for them.

The waitlist is unranked, but surely, they have a system to note certain applicants' important traits to make a more diverse class and not just randomly pick. Just send in your LOCI and forget about the school since it's unreliable to hope for anything. Also, the gap year plan is rare to get I'm guessing, but they said choosing to take a gap year doesn't affect your chances of getting off the waitlist.",1711929718.0

In those days there were many open conservatives in the scene. It was post 911 and there was a lot of healthy debate going on. The sad thing is that in those days no one said idiotic things like ‚ÄúBeing conservative literally kills people‚Äù or ‚ÄúConservatives are fascists‚Äù. Yes, people who leaned right were out numbered, but everyone was judged on the way they acted, not their politics. There was no political hatred. That wasn‚Äôt a thing until recently. We could all agree to differ. Even the punk scene was like that at the time.

There used to also be a lot nuance as a lot of people in the scene were socially liberal, but politically conservative. And some were fairly socially conservative as well.",1711929719.0

"DevelEire","t5_37lrj","If you're moving to Australia, watch a couple of things 

Rule #1 if there is any way to come down as a PR do it before you arrive. If you can do this it pays for itself in months not years. 



1. Getting a job with sponsorship and a path to PR is a painful process. Make sure you understand this process. 

Also, make sure you understand the pay hit and the challenge of finding a role that will sponsor. 

Many jobs here will be PR or resident only. 


2. Make sure you get off Sponsorship ASAP. 
It hurts your salary, flexibility and if you lose a job you have a month to find another one 



3. You need to understand the salary range and cost of living here before you come down. Ensure you don't arrive here thinking 70k a year is an excellent salary in Sydney, and you'll. 

4. The job market is different here. In Ireland, the RnD tax makes product development a thing everywhere. RnD is rarer here. Service and Software sales are much more prominent here. 


5. There is more competition here. Australia imports significant numbers of Indian, Chinese and Asian IT workers who compete for roles. This drives down salaries in the IT sector with both supply and competition. 


I arrived in Oz 15 years ago as a C# developer at a low salary band after finishing a good contract in Dublin for some good money, with a significant step down in lifestyle. 
It took a lot of work and some luck to get re-established.

For me, I try to kick start the day with about 30-40 grams of protein- Oikos Pro Greek Yogurt, protein granola, fruit. I also mix 1/2 of a Core Power Shake with coffee. Lunch is usually salad/ fresh veg heavy, with a Greek yogurt/ Catalina Crunch topping. Dinner is typically a protein pasta or rice with veggies, sometimes a vegetarian meat substitute. I use cottage cheese, Chobani Complete smoothies, Quest products, etc to help me get in extra protein for snacks.

"balkans_irl","t5_n458w","You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.

It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.

Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.

I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.

The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.

Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.

You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.

If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.

You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.

The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.

I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.

When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.

My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.",1711929721.0

(We get pet supplies thru chewy, so we have plenty of boxes for him.) It works great he never chews up anything else in the house except his when his cat siblings leave their toys around the house for him to get.

&#x200B;

So, thats 20,000$ total on a 300k place, i'm looking at listings right now that would have you paying 1700$ a month in rent and owning the property.

if you put 40k of your 60k as a down-payment your monthly bill goes down to about $1500 which is cheaper than rent in hrm will ever be again.",1711929722.0

This way, the entire team looks good, and everyone gets practice showcasing their skills. 

Sometimes, you need to stay in a position long enough to show results and then move on.  Quitting before showing results makes you a bad bet for investing time into your training.

We talked about,  among other things and in an age appropriate way,  how to deal with bullies and how to accept our bodies.

- 60k points worth of mastery via Drifter intrinsics. A few upgrades will affect non-Duviri gameplay

- 12 arcanes, mostly niche, but some can be powerful when used correctly (i.e. Magus Aggress, Longbow Sharpshot, Shotgun Vendetta, Secondary Outburst, Primary Blight)

- An alternative farm for a good chunk of the game's Warframe roster, which has no RNG bullshit, just filling up a progression bar. If you can't handle the farms of the likes of Nidus, Harrow, Khora, or Hildryn, then here's your chance

- Access to the Incarnon Genesis system - Void upgrades to otherwise weak weapons that turn them into meta-dominating boom sticks. Some of these are legitimately the strongest weapons in the game, ever",1711929724.0

Look this argument has been fun, clearly we‚Äôre not changing each others opinions. For what it‚Äôs worth, I think he‚Äôll stay another season, hopefully with different medical staff this time.

"gme_meltdown","t5_3vpfzk","And how do you know which parts of the Bible are supposed to be the literal word of God and which are not? The text doesn't say that at all, and many, many others would argue with you over which are and aren't meant to be taken seriously. So how are YOU the authority which knows what parts are literal vs hypothetical? How do you determine that?


I'm listening fine, you're just annoyed I don't buy your BS. No, we don't take some parts of a law as more ""real"" than others.


If you believe in God and Jesus, it's because you believe the Bible. They are not declared real and sacred anywhere else. To believe that, you need to believe the Bible is real and true. But you can't then say ""It's real, but some parts are realer than others, and this part isn't meant to be taken literally, and I can't tell you WHY this part isn't true other than the fact that it conflicts with what I WANT to be true so I'll ignore it and make up a story that says God wanted me to ignore that bit.""



It's hypocritical and very convenient that you can discard anything you don't like and claim it wasn't meant to be taken literally.

This sub can be a hugbox saying ""of course,"" but in a more 'general audience' sub like askwomen you may get more 'realtalk' answers. 

One of my pet peeves is that this sub becomes a dumping ground for all issues. DEI, trans, etc. I think things like trans questions belong in asktransgender, not here. I think general questions to women in general, not feminists, probably are better served in askwomen than here.",1711929726.0

The main thing that reviewers like to see and hear from you is your process from idea to final product. So having both drafts, renderings/sketches, or any other process work you did alongside the finished product. In the review you can show them how you took your idea and made it a reality.

It‚Äôs best to go show by show. I would say pick a few costumes from each that show variety of skills or ideas, or that best represent your design aesthetic or concept for that show. Try to tell a story about your process for each show using the pieces you select.",1711929726.0

"transit","t5_2qha9","While the comprehensive response above is 100% correct, in more vague terms there will be time savings as currently trains have to travel at 60kmh or less around some corners and bends which requires them to slow down and accelerate, adding to the travel time. The current rolling stock I believe travel at 120kmh on previously straightened stretches of track (although I could be wrong) so you can imagine this project will improve travel times considerably.

On top of this, most of the line is single track, so duplicating this will also avoid delays and speed up services",1711929726.0

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","1312 hours of pure gameplay not counting queue times, considering each game is average of 15 minutes, and 875 hrs if taking average as 10min. That's... Not that bad actually considering just HOW MUCH there are to unlock? And if you just cut it down to let's say, 10 killers and survivors with strongest perks or perks you just want to use specifically yourself to include individual preferences, suddenly you have much less to do.

I just don't think that the mentality of ""i want to unlock EVERYTHING without too much hustle"" is used in a good faith when saying that grind is too slow. They already cut down blood points grind multiple times, and cut down iri shards grind to unlock original characters. If you don't focus on having to unlock Everything, then its not as dreadful as many trying to make it look like. After all, many perks are underused soooo, so most of the people who got them basically spent their time unlocking them to tickle their perfectionist within.",1711929726.0

I would think that, properly speaking, most Protestants would call us heretics if they were defining things precisely. I regularly bow down to icons of the Theotokos and joyfully extoll her virtues, and I don't know any Protestants who call that kosher.

"CatAdvice","t5_2sn56","I'd advise against during the normal hours your awake with being quiet and such with a new kitten as this time period is when your kitten is getting used to their new environment and yourselves. 

As a result it's one of the best times to make noises that would make an adult cat jump or run away by exposing them to said sounds. When I say expose I mean having like using vacuum to do cleaning and taking your time or allow pots to clang against each other rather than be super careful with placement.....DO NOT chase or force the kitten to stay in front of it or in the same room....same with plastic bags. 

Now while cats do sleep they do well....cat naps in terms of length and when they are appearing to be sleeping they may just be chilling out. They'll also move somewhere else if they want to get peace and quiet since they can be very independent and intelligent. The only way I know to tell if a cat is asleep without waking them up is to spot them twitching away which can be rare.

So please don't change your routine or quieten what you do just because your kitten appears to be sleeping they can adjust to your routine and won't know to be quiet when your sleeping if they gain their case of the zoomies or their first round of being in heat occurs. (if you allow that to occur) The only two things I would suggest doing is keep an eye out for them to avoid stepping on them or their hiding spots and take note what does scare/startle them after a few weeks.",1711929728.0

They possess a recently deceased slave on an old wizards secret lab.

The character is in a weak injured body, and stuck next to a crazed wizard who can kill him with a glance if he wants. He puts all his intelligence and scheming to work, eventually resulting in an epic assassination over several chapters.

I don't think you're necessarily wrong in assuming that (cishet) men are generally more interested in action while (cishet) women are generally more interested in emotional scenes- that is the societal expectation that has been drilled into many of us, and many people take care to fall in line with it. That being said, I don't think that's actually indicative of a concrete difference between genders, but rather a direct result of how we're socialized from birth (speaking as a USAmerican). Some people fall into the trap of thinking that this is somehow proof of the two binary genders being fundamentally different, but that's just not true. 

At the end of the day, hobbies have no gender. These are interesting discussions to have, but it's important to take care that we aren't just inventing Gender Roles 2.0 by relying on stereotypes.",1711929729.0

Because they are older, they want content in books that is age- appropriate. All of the pictures and visuals graphic novels provides help to aid in their comprehension of the text even while their reading skills and English language are still developing.

I would also suggest starting out with comic books if a whole graphic novel is intimidating or too much at once. There are some great comic book series where the story is broken up into sizable chunks each issue. Best of luck! :)",1711929730.0

I can almost guarantee you 1 mg of Xanax will provide immediate relief (won't hurt to try). He should just go to the doctor and say he has anxiety, has tried SSRIs before etc and Xanax is the only thing that works for his anxiety. My family doctor knows I take it for both pain and anxiety and they have no problem prescribing it to me. I get 90 .5mg pills a month but usually only 1 mg is needed.

As another poster recommended, take some detailed pictures of the whole backyard and post it to gardening, landscaping and if you have any, local Reddit pages.

Tyger Claws were a lot harder to quickhack than, say, Maelstrom, Scavs or Animals, a lot of their work is over the internet because of their connections to Japan, and she already has an in with the gang through her previous work at Clouds.

So if you're looking for protection from the Voodoo Boys, and you pointedly cannot ask for corporate protection, getting under the wing of the Tyger Claws was about the best she could do.

"CDrama","t5_34fkz","3 weeks late to this, but just wanted to comment on a positive post, as I've seen loads slating it as boring/awkward.
I honestly didn't think I'd get into this. I get so bored with SOL/pure fluff kinda stuff. So many that others have loved and I've stopped because it's just more of the same fluff every ep. So I had a bad feeling about this.
But I absolutely devoured this series. I was waiting to get bored, never happened. Waiting to feel awkward, Never happened (except maybe the terrible dubbed English bits ü§£)
I normally live for angst and drama, I'd just finished Till the end of the moon and figured this would bore me to death.
But there's just something about Wu Lei's ability to show desire without really doing much of anything. It never got boring because it always gave me goosebumps every time he looked or got near her, because he honestly looked like he wanted to devour her ü•µü§£ so even though it was incredibly PG/censored, it kept me completely enthralled all throughout because it felt so intimate and intense even without anything racy ever being shown.
There's nothing better in a romance drama than that first moment where they finally get close and something's about to happen, it's my favourite bit. But then they get together and it mellows.
This one, literally every time they met back up, saw each other, I got that same feeling, can't really explain what it was, whether it was purely Wu Lei's acting, or the fact they were travelling and separated a lot or the general storyline, but something about this just kept giving me that same butterflies feeling every time they were in each others vicinity.
I'm fascinated that I was able to enjoy this type of slow burn/mainly fluff kind of drama tbh, but it's really up there with the best for me ‚ù§Ô∏è",1711929733.0

I had an outside trigger in that my dad died, and it was the first time I'd encountered death (all grandparents gone by the time I was born) so I went for grief counselling because that flaw in my personality became me overall. I got into mindfulness. It just slows everything down so you can see what's going to happen, and it empowers you to choose what happens next.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Why is it humiliating? It can be embarrassing, sure‚Ä¶ however, I‚Äôve found that people, academic or not, who can admit their mistakes earn much more respect than those who double down. Like you said in your post, mistakes are a gateway to growth. 

As for the instance of being factually wrong - nobody can know everything. When others call out our wrong facts, they can make it out as a personal attack, be neutral, or use it as an opportunity to educate further. If it‚Äôs a personal attack, the replier is an asshat who does not want to be civil, please don‚Äôt take it personally. With the neutral or educational replies, these responders give you information you didn‚Äôt previously have so you can fashion a better-informed point. With that information, you can either grow or shut down. When you choose to grow and open your mind, you, by default, become more confident and sure in your arguments. 

I‚Äôm on mobile, so sorry if I drop any points‚Ä¶ onward! 

I‚Äôd also wonder who you‚Äôre trying to debate with..? Talking about politics and religion, there will always be people who want to shout or argue. You will never win a debate with them, especially on the internet. 

FWIW, religion is a very volition and personal subject. You being forced to do anything regarding it is a travesty. You not being comfortable being around it is reason enough. If people around you are forcing you into such settings or conversations, they are showing a fundamental lack of respect for your autonomy. You don‚Äôt have to explain yourself to these people.

Politics is a bit trickier, so I‚Äôd still recommend you reflect on the views you have to determine why you believe in them. 

On that note, not being an intellectual doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have founded opinions. I‚Äôve known PhDs who are pretty naive and dumb outside of their subject area. I‚Äôve known odd-job workers who could debate and drink anyone under the table on hundreds of topics. At the core of it, learning your ‚Äòwhy‚Äôs comes down to how willing you are to explore yourself. 

For example: I hate fish. I don‚Äôt need to write a dissertation on why I despise it. I just dislike the taste of affordable fish and won‚Äôt pay the markup for decent fish, if it is even available. Someone could come at me and regale all of the benefits of fish, but the fact of the matter is, simply, that I don‚Äôt like the taste and I get to choose what I eat. 

Another: I was raised Presbyterian and educated Catholic. I can‚Äôt stand religion after that. People will come after me talking about their god‚Äôs salvation, so I let them say their piece, then politely tell them not to insert themselves into my private affairs. Their opinion doesn‚Äôt matter to me. 

An argument doesn‚Äôt have to be intellectual. It does need to be sound. If you look at your views, you can find why you believe them without words with massive amounts of syllables. Just because you don‚Äôt see yourself as an intellectual doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have an intellect. 

From my experience, too many people use big words and complicated syntax to hide their own insecurities. If you‚Äôre secure in your beliefs, and the other isn‚Äôt, you will probably win the debate. It will just take the time to get more self-awareness in your arsenal.",1711929734.0

You may have to look up if they have online services at their pages as well. A link to the directory is right below. You should avoid SGI and New Kadampa because they are high-control groups though. You can search by tradition. A lot of temples nowadays have zoom meetings that you can attend. All of the traditions will share a common base of the Four Noble Truths, anatta/anatman and the Eight-Fold Path along with the Four Seals of the Dharma. r/sangha also has links to temples that stream as well as temple locations. You can read stuff though.

Tricycle describes differences between the traditions well. As for reading and learning about the basics, it is best to focus on and start with the elements shared by all the traditions. All of them start with ethics but also include understanding sila or training in relation to other beliefs like anatman/anatta, dependent origination and the Four Noble truths. Study Buddhism is a good website that has some essential elements from all traditions but also has more specific material on Tibetan Buddhism. Below is a link to it. Tricycle has a good in introduction as well and is linked below. Some traditions have classes or other resources if you prefer.

FPMT has classes you can do at your own pace that are an introduction to Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism but also has a discovering Buddhism class that is meant to be a general introduction to Buddhism and a few classes aimed at general Mahayana views. They also have in person versions and synchronous online versions courses if you have time for them. They are good because they also introduce you to practices in that tradition. Tergar has material in the Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism as well. Tara's Triple Excellence is another program that you can do online at your pace in the Tibetan tradition. Henjyoji Shingon Buddhist Temple, a Shingon Temple also has online classes you can attend. Korinji Monastery has instructional videos and materials in the Rinzai zen tradition as well. All of these will introduce you to the basics too.

Below are some resources that can teach you the fundamentals. You might want to check out the Buddhism for Beginners Series by Alan Peto. He introduces basic practices, beliefs, and various traditions. Here is a link to his Youtube page. He also has an introduction to Buddhism book that he co-wrote with a Theravada tradition monk named Sanathavihari Bhikkhu. It is a bit more focused on daily practice.

Buddhism for Beginners (Has good videos on the Four Noble Truths, Eight Fold Path, Precepts, Dependent Origination and how they hold together, as well as the various traditions). This series includes videos on various traditions.

If you want to look deeper into Buddhist philosophy, Buddhism as Philosophy by Mark Siderits. It is a very good look at Buddhist philosophy or An Introduction to Buddhist Philosophy by Stephen J. Laumakis are good texts. Below are some materials that introduce you to Buddhist ethics and some basics of Buddhist philosophy. They can be useful if you want to learn more about the concepts and arguments for them in Buddhism. If you are looking for a look at Buddhist Metaphysics, maybe answering the question 'how things work' How Things Are An Introduction to Buddhist Metaphysics by Mark Siderits is a good text. However, it is best to know the basics before reading it.

As for a book that goes into detail about various traditions of Buddhism. You may want to try Buddha Dharma: The Way to Enlightenment. You can download a PDF copy below. It is an anthology of sections from the Buddhist sutras and commentaries and goes through various traditions. It is big though. Another good text is Approaching the Buddhist Path by the Dalai Lama and Thubten Chodron. The Heart of the Buddha‚Äôs Teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh is another really good text. These particular texts are good places to start. I hope all this helps. Don't worry about doing all of this at once. You can take your time.

I decided at some point to just full send it and just run directly into the parts of the world that scared me the most (I won't get into specifics to avoid any spoilers)

I finished the DLC that night. The scariest part (at least for me) was genuinely just not knowing. Like I can't tell you how quick my fear turned into mild annoyance.

There are words which are slurs depending on the context but not slurs used other times. I'm thinking in particular of the word queer, as I use this to describe myself instead of listing different labels that come under that umbrella. However it's a word that has been weaponised against the LGBT+ community it can become a slur. so I completely appreiciate there are those who do not use that word and I wouldn't use it in their company to be respectful. 

I think different marginalised communities have their own words that is acceptable to use with each other but are otherwise weaponised against them. I think that's difference. Is that slur being weaponised against someone. I think Gallows Humour rules apply here. 

This bill is going to apply more to hate speech (and instances of verbal abuse motivated by those protected characteristics). To clarify what I mean by hate speech, I'm talking about genuine bigoted extremists who are vocal in being racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, ableist etc. I don't think the police or justice system care about the likes of my autistic friend who calls themself the R word if someone even cared enough in an instance like that to make a phone call.",1711929736.0

"CharacterRant","t5_35frv","Here's the thing: I believe that the canon ending guaranteed Paradis more peace than in a hypothetical 100% Rumbling ending.


In that hypothetical, they're left as the last batch of humanity. If the first 3 seasons have taught us anything, it's that Paradis is no stranger to infighting and civil unrest so a civil war is inevitable. Especially if the Jaegerists continue to rule the island and people grow tired of their military rule.


And once war does break out, it'll effect both the population and the land - that's a blow to both their people and agriculture, which isn't good for such a small island.


And it's not like venturing overseas is an option - they'd first have to clean up Eren's mess which will cost them time and resources. Only once that's done can they begin to attempt reforestation (do they have qualified teams to do this complicated process? It's not as simple as planting a tree, you gotta maintain an entire ecosystem) and then move on to farming, housing and building a society. And until they can become self-sufficient, they're using the island's limited resources to feed everyone and help them do their jobs.¬†All this would take generations to complete and only add to the unrest.


So... yeah, the way I see it the canon ending was Paradis' best option - enjoy a few centuries of peace and then get bombed in a war that's likely unrelated to the Rumbling. And given life still exists on the island after, they can rebuild.",1711929737.0

Once we go beyond that, the deeper issue is that I haven‚Äôt been in a long term (longer than a year) relationship in almost a decade. So my lifestyle/personality/expectations/career has been based around having been single my entire adult life. There are plenty times I wish I had a partner (especially as more of my friends get married and I‚Äôm left alone) but I‚Äôm usually reminded that it would almost certainly disrupt a lot of the things I like doing when I‚Äôm single

I know people say that their SO is their best friend so being with them doesn‚Äôt feel like a burden compared to being single, but that also comes from the perspective of a person who already has someone in their life.

She was trying to cope with her situation which was not just the loss of her husband, but the end of the world due to a zombie apocalypse. It makes perfect sense that someone in a situation like that would employ maladaptive coping methods, from a psychological standpoint. Just like if someone turned to alcohol you wouldn't say, ""Only 2 weeks after!? That's too soon to become alcohol dependent."" It wasn't a thought- out life change, it was a result of desperation and emotional chaos.
Also, how do you suppose she played both sides? She told him to stay away from him the moment she found out Rick was alive. She only even empathized with him further down the line ONCE, and I think that was because she was grateful at the time for his help. I actually think her treatment of Shane might not have been the best move to diffuse the situation, icing him out like that without empathy or discussion. Though, I don't think anything anyone did would have prevented his unwinding. 
I'm not saying moving on after 2 weeks isn't messed up, but moving on isn't what she was doing.",1711929739.0

>all get some play. certain classes will always be more popular than others. 

Now you're just being obtuse. If popularity was the end-all-be all of why classes were played we'd see some variation but not ""sub-2% play"" in the mode. You can't tell me that only 1% of catalyst players play fractals when multiple characters exist per account.

Anyways...I'm talking about the relationships that were written on the show.¬†


I saw nothing about Barry/Caitlin or Barry/Patty that suggest either of these women could compete with Iris for Barry


Barry's initial interest in Patty was weak. He needed 3 people to talk him into dating her. Honestly Grant played Barry as not being all that interested in her. Their first meeting is pure cringe with Patty saying it's like Barry was there when someone was murdered. The fact that his father didn't know anything about the chick and he never had any intention on telling Patty he was the Flash until Iris said something in ep 10 tells me he never saw her as a viable long term option. It's really interesting that Patty was made out to be Barry's clone but their connection was weak. Barry asking Iris out in Flashpoint beats any cutesy scene they gave Batty. Fact is Barry didn't grow with Patty and their relationship did nothing for his character but waste time. Patty got the best exit because dumpville was certainly in her future. Seeing he was married to Iris on Earth 2 and seeing Iris ready to date again? Patty wouldn't stand a chance


As for Caitlin, Barry treated her like a sister. People love to bring up ep 12 as the great SB ep showing their potential but for me it did the opposite. Caitlin gets drunk and Barry tucks her in bed like a good big brother. Then at the end of the ep asks the girl he's actually sexually interested in. The most you can say for SB is Caitlin had a crush in S1 but either way there's no canon scene of Barry having any interest in this chick. Even Grant said Barry would hook up with Cisco before Caitlin. If Iris died, Barry would dig up Iris's corpse before giving that chick the time of day. Barry wasn't even the best friend to Caitlin (that was Cisco) but somehow people convinced themselves he's her soulmate? To each their own


It's hilarious how there's canon scenes that contradict every statement you make about Iris. Aside from that, your opinion¬† but there was plenty of spark to me. I couldn't buy Iris saw Barry as a brother because she was too touchy feely with him.¬†

"movingtojapan","t5_3fy6c","I already replied to your direct question, but thought I would also reply in regards to whether your wife will lose her green card.

Here is a relevant write-up by USCIS.

[https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted/international-travel-permanent-resident](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted/international-travel-permanent-resident)

>Does travel outside the United States affect my permanent resident status?  
  
Permanent residents are free to travel outside the United States, and temporary or brief travel usually does not affect your permanent resident status. If it is determined, however, that you did not intend to make the United States your permanent home, you will be found to have abandoned your permanent resident status. A general guide used is whether you have been absent from the United States for more than a year. Abandonment may be found to occur in trips of less than a year where it is believed you did not intend to make the United States your permanent residence. While brief trips abroad generally are not problematic, the officer may consider criteria such as whether your intention was to visit abroad only temporarily, whether you maintained U.S. family and community ties, maintained U.S employment, filed U.S. income taxes as a resident, or otherwise established your intention to return to the United States as your permanent home. Other factors that may be considered include whether you maintained a U.S. mailing address, kept U.S. bank accounts and a valid U.S. driver‚Äôs license, own property or run a business in the United States, or any other evidence that supports the temporary nature of your absence.

So if at any point she truly doesn't intend to make the US her permanent home, she is supposed to give up her green card.

But if she does still intend to make the US her permanent home, she may still be found to have abandoned her permanent resident status.

Be aware that she doesn't have to let airport immigration pressure her into signing that she is giving up permanent residence, as explained at this link:  [AILA Know Your Rights: What to Do if You are Detained at a Port of Entry (Lawful Permanent Residents)](https://www.aila.org/File/Related/18110604b.pdf).

One way for her to minimize the chance of questioning by airport immigration is to get a Global Entry.  However if she is absent more than one year, she will likely get flagged and stopped anyway.",1711929739.0

"Crushes","t5_2udig","That is such a cute story. I‚Äôll be honest. It‚Äôs better to take risks than to end up regretting not taking the risks at all. Bc I‚Äôm regretting‚Ä¶even though I moved on from this guy  I wish I could‚Äôve told him how much he impacted me and thanked him. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be getting that opportunity. The fact that you regretted for merely speeding past her at the theatre shows that if you don‚Äôt take the risks, you will probs feel worse regret than that time. I would definitely recommend straight up walking or changing your daily route to ‚Äúaccidentally bump into her at a place she goes to, so you can straight up talk to her. If you nervous I recommend roughly planning what you‚Äôre gonna say and rehearsing it. But not too much to the point you where you would sound like a robot. Accidentally bumping into her would be great if you can cuz then you can say you recognised her from around school and then you can introduce yourselves (then you can learn her name) talk abt things you know you have in common (e.g same teachers) you can even straight up tell her that you thought she was pretty/cute and if you could have her number or something ( just ideas) 

If you absolutely can‚Äôt ever see her alone: 
I get the two friend thing is intimidating but I was personally in a trio and they were super supportive of my crushes + guys. If you sorta know she‚Äôs a kind girl hanging around kind friends then there is no need to worry. I doubt they would judge and say half the things in your mind. They might even instinctively back away when you go up to her. Or if you know they won‚Äôt do that and are you can approach them and say to ur crush hey can talk to you for a sec if you ain‚Äôt busy (something like that) and slowly move away from the other two and she would naturally follow (hopefully) 

Some tips when talking to her: 
‚Ä¢ Try to be relax cuz if you‚Äôre nervous she will probs end up more nervous. 
‚Ä¢ steady speed of talking 
‚Ä¢ casual and fun (don‚Äôt be too serious and don‚Äôt forget to smile )

I can see how it can work in favor for anatomy. Anatomy specifically you need to know the muscle/organ, what nerve innervates and their origin, attachment points, arteries supplying, veins draining, and their functions. What is it secreting as an organ? What functions do you lose if you cut this nerve? Is there an alternative blood supply (anastomose) if this artery was blocked?

The ""professional"" investigators with the Winnipeg Police Service found NONE of that.  NOTHING.  Anything they did find either wasn't allowed in court or didn't have any direct ties to Raymond.  

ALL they had was the fact that the two of them knew each other, may have done drugs together, and the Crown alleged that Raymond wanted to have sex with Tina.  That's IT.  

""Cormier has a lengthy criminal record with 92 convictions in assault, weapons, drugs and fraud."" 

The fact that he had a ""lengthy criminal record"" and knew Tina was enough for the ""professional"" investigators in the Winnipeg Police Service to hone in on him and ignore all the other potential suspects.

Like.....Tina was a drug addict and a prostitute.  What about all the strangers she had sex with?  What about the dealers she got her drugs from - maybe she ripped someone off?

In any capacity that line, like most of his 8th edition codex entry that was a condensed paraphrasing of Realm of Chaos. 

The original line was ‚ÄúThe living know that they will die, and many know that they will live with disease or other torment, yet they drive this knowledge into a comer of their minds and keep it pinioned there with all manner of dreams and activity. Nurgle is the embodiment of that knowledge and of the unconscious response to it, of the hidden fear of disease and decay. and of the power of life which that fear generates.‚Äù

Which is then elaborated on in the following

‚ÄúNurgle is the eternal enemy of the Chaos Power Tzeentch, the Lord of Change. Nurgle and Tzeentch draw their energy from opposing beliefs. While the energy of Tzeentch comes from hope and changing fortune, that of Nurgle comes from defiance born of despair and hopelessness.

Offering up the Lamb of God symbolically relieved humans from having to make material sacrifices to God to atone for their sins. Jesus became a protective path to God.

Average Joe: ""Hey, Jesus, would you ask your dad if I can come over to your place?""

Jesus: (to AJ) ""Sure.  That's what I died for.""

A few tips:

Bring a cheap very flexible HDMI cable with you so that in case the TV‚Äôs HDMI port is hard to access, you can just leave the cable there (many TVs are wall mounted and it‚Äôs hard to get your hands back there). 

In many hotels you need to unplug the network cable that‚Äôs plugged into the TV from the box on the back so you can use the buttons on the TV to switch inputs. That box somehow locks out the TV‚Äôs buttons.

"portugal","t5_2qmie","Acho sempre uma piada gigante quando se fala das gera√ß√µes mais novas e do ""antigamente √© que era bom"". Estas conversas do ""antigamente √© que era bom"" existe desde sempre. Quero mesmo dizer sempre. At√© mesmo na idade medieval.

Os tempos mudam, a tecnologia e sociedade tamb√©m. As gera√ß√µes novas crescem consoante essas mudan√ßas. Da mesma forma que se diz que as novas gera√ß√µes est√£o perdidas, o mesmo se criticava da ""gera√ß√£o de ferro"" pelas gera√ß√µes anteriores. A ideia que o mundo vai acabar tamb√©m vem dos tempos da idade medieval, n√£o √© algo novo.

N√£o √© preciso muito poder mental para perceber que todas as gera√ß√µes tiveram os seus pr√≥prios desafios e coisas boas. Uma gera√ß√£o n√£o √© melhor que a outra. O problema √© a mentalidade acabada que alguns ""antigos"" t√™m onde estagnaram e vivem da nostalgia do passado, muitas vezes esquecendo (ou escolhendo esquecer) os grandes podres do seu tempo.

Faz-me lembrar agora a hist√≥ria de se falar de um poss√≠vel retorno do servi√ßo militar obrigat√≥rio e os velhotes falarem disso com os argumentos ""foi aqui que aprendi a ser homem!"" ou ""faz falta para estes putos ganharem respeito e disciplina!"".

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","If Skyrim Special Edition crashes immediately after you launch it ‚Äî particularly if your crash log lists memory address `0198090` address (version 1.6.640 address) or `05E1F22` (1.5.97 address) ‚Äî then you are experiencing one of the following issues:

* You are missing a master file. That is: you have some Mod A that relies on Mod B, but you only installed Mod A and not Mod B.

* More likely: one of your installed mods (or an official content file) may have file format version 1.71, meaning it was made for game version 1.6.1130 or higher. This format is not fully backwards compatible; if you're running an older version of the game, then these files can cause crashes on startup. Installing [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441?tab=files) will allow older versions of the game to load these files safely.

Make sure to check the [troubleshooting guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/troubleshooting_guide) for help with crashes and other problems!
 
* If you are on Skyrim version 1.5 (SE), the [.NET Script Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21294) can also help in diagnosing crashes.

* If you are on Skyrim Version 1.6 (AE) or Skyrim VR, [Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818) can also help in diagnosing crashes. If you also use MO2, you can use [this plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66743) for improved functionality!
 
DO NOT post an analyzed crash log. It strips all the useful information.

Don't use trainwreck. The log it produces is less informative than other options linked above.

"Gloomhaven","t5_3hpmt",">More importantly, they give quick, subtle cues about a class' play-style and build options, as the masteries typically exaggerate a tactical theme from the different builds of a class.

This is a great point, getting players to ask themselves, how many fast turns in a row could I take, or how big a trap could I build help extend the horizons of what a character might be able to do. While I agree with others that the execution in Frosthaven often seems like you are either being asked to either ice skate on railroad tracks (taking on a pointless level of danger just to show off) or get involved in a drinking contest (where even victory doesn't feel great) the vision and purpose of masteries remains AMAZING.",1711929741.0

My mom is not an expert seamstress, but she sews as a hobby and made me several things over the course of my life. I asked her to make me my wedding dress and she did (she was nervous, lol). It came out beautifully and exactly like I imagined. She took my sketch, found a pattern she altered, she made muslin mockups for me to test the fit and style before cutting into the real thing, then every step of the way she had me trying on the dress pieces before sewing them together, I had to physically wear the dress to have it hemmed appropriately/the sleeves hemmed/the extra long train cut to length.

My point is...if someone who didn't go to school for design can put together a dream dress, then there is zero excuse for Zoey to have screwed you so bad. Where were all your fittings, hemming, cross checks, etc?

Parfois j'ai l'impression que ton propos est un m√©lange de r√©jouissance qu'on puisse ne pas s'en sortir, m√©l√© d'une peur incroyable de l'avenir, √ßa dessert ton propos. Tu pars loin dans le cosmique quand m√™me! Reste les pieds sur Terre, tu t'int√©resses beaucoup √† la fin, mais c'est ce qui est le moins int√©ressant! 

En plus on la connait tous, la fin. Le plus important est l'effort actuel sur la r√©solution de tout √ßa, et cela m√©rite supporters et sponsors, ce n'est pas futile ou inutile. Et il y a la vie sur le chemin, c'est quand m√™me pas mal la vie non? Je trouve perso que √ßa a un sens, transmettre la joie, avoir des enfants, aimer, s'√©merveiller, construire un avenir. Je pense √ßa vaut le coup de vivre dans son √©poque et participer √† √ßa, √† chacun sa mani√®re, √ßa a un sens. 

Si je te suis, comme tout va dispara√Ætre et que les chances de survie de l'esp√®ce sur le tr√®s long terme sont basses (et oui, le soleil dispara√Ætra, ressources finies etc...), cela devrait nous dire que rien n'a de sens, que c'est futile? Malthus disait que la surpopulation nous tuerait, de tous temps il y a eu plein d'annonciateurs d'apocalypse, ils ont tous un point commun, ils ont eu tord et √©taient tous particuli√®rement d√©testables, certains menaient aussi des sectes. Le progr√®s, le sens de l'urgence, et une certaine forme d'auto-r√©gulation naturelle difficilement quantifiable ont contr√© tout cela. Le monde va changer, pas forc√©ment en meilleur ou en moins bien. Mais la fin du monde c'est pas tout √† fait pour demain, et l'humain est le seul recours connu sur le moyen terme au moins, nous devrions le soutenir.

Le nihilisme est un camouflage √©l√©gant de flemme et de l√¢chet√© car cela pousse √† l'inaction, cela n'a aucun int√©r√™t comme th√©orie √† d√©fendre ou suivre pour moi, car √ßa n'a ni d√©but ni fin, c'est √©ventuellement ludique, mais est-ce que ca rend meilleur l'homme? De ce que j'ai observ√©, cela am√®ne l'amertume, l'aigreur, le conservatisme aussi, rien qui ne m√©rite d'√™tre mis en avant, pourquoi perdre son temps l√† dedans, pour avoir ""raison""? C'est quand m√™me cher pay√© juste pour avoir un peu plus de loisirs √† d√©battre, mais ce n'est que mon avis.",1711929743.0

This is pretty much entirely incorrect. I don't think I've ever heard of or seen ""◊ë◊¢"" as a standalone word being used in that manner -- can you reference any other cases in which it was used that way? ""◊ë÷∏÷º◊¢÷∑◊ú"" does mean possessor and such; it's not ""shortened"" to ""◊ë◊¢"". The verb definition ""◊ë÷∏÷º◊¢÷∏◊î"" is based on the root word referring to travel -- it refers to possession in the same would you would say ""it ***came*** into my possession"". It's not based on the root word referencing sovereignship.

The list of abbreviations you provide are literally exact abbreviations (and largely modern-day ones, at that), not prefixes/suffixes. You're doing the equivalent of seeing the word ""cilia"", and concluding that it has something to do with spycraft, because the first two letters ""CI"" are also in ""CIA"".",1711929743.0

"callofcthulhu","t5_2sdez","> Preparing the adventure took me weeks, preparing each chapter takes me 10-15 hours and preparing each session takes 2-3 hours.

How are you spending this time, can I ask? I'm running MoN now, and it takes me about 15 minutes of prep per session (not counting the time it took me to read the whole thing).

>Do you write meticulous notes or blurbs for each character, location, clue and story point?

For something like MoN, this is going to take forever, so: no. I look up some things I am curious about and perhaps some photos, and otherwise I run it from the book itself. A lot of the historical research has been done for you. If you need to feel organised, each chapter has a clue flowchart that is really handy, I like to screenshot those from the PDF as a reminder, but otherwise, the work has been done for you. That's *why* MoN is weighty.

>How much time do you spend on preparing a module like this, both beforehand and between sessions?

I have a set of PC notes for each person, which I update regularly, and I'm sure I spend time re-reading things and tweaking aspects of it to my preferences, but it's an hour here and there between a few sessions.

>Do you have any (positive) experience with using AI to simplify preparation?

My experiments with AI have shown them to be totally unreliable. They will simply invent details that aren't there; which can contradict/reveal existing plot details.

I think you are over-preparing. You don't have to stick to the scenario rigidly.",1711929745.0

"fo76","t5_jrw25","So Fixer can be automatic or semi depending on receiver modification. You learn most of it's mods from scrapping combat rifles. Obtain the combat rifle plan, mass craft the lowest level version and scrap those. Or hunt combat rifle drops from enemies.


Fixer is best with vats, automatic for commando and slapping crits. You will want to focus on consistent crits. With Crit Savvy rank 3 and 23 or 33 luck, you will reliably and consistently crit.


50 cal is a heavy gun, which is best non-vats and paired with power armor.


One of the best choices you can make is picking one weapon class to specialize into. So pick commando, rifleman or heavy. Avoid mixing them together. It is possible to do hybrid builds, but specializing really pays off.


Pick 3 or 4 legendary specials. They allow more perk points for slotting into your loadout. More regular perks is better than most of the other legendary perks options. You will have 6 legendary perks slots eventually. Your final choices will depend what build you pick to specialize into.


Definitely get mutated. Hop vendors for serums. There are related perks (Strange in Numbers and Starched Genes being necessary, Class Freak optional). If you are PC, I can hook you up. Mutations provide a wide array of benefits with very little downsides. Like Speed Demon brings you to max move speed. Marsupial for higher jumps. Mutations will directly and indirectly boost both your damage output and help decrease damage taken. Also boost xp gains, stealth and AP etc.

"MauLer","t5_pitbo",">>And same questions apply there as well, of course - they only sent 6 and then 3 TIEs against 30 rebel fighters, that possibly must've been an intentional ploy, right??
> 
>Tarkin refused to deploy the Death Star's TIE squadrons, feeling that the power of the battlestation (i.e., its turbolaser batteries) would be enough to defeat the rebels The only pilots who deployed were either already patrolling to station or had been explicitly ordered to launch by Vader.

Now that's just pure 100% headcanon or maybe EU, absolutely 0 of this was even hinted at in the movie.
 
> Also, I never called it an intentional ploy. In fact, I said that that is a key example of where the Empire actually loses, and it was because of Tarkin's overconfidence.

Of course not, that's the whole point - they send ""too few TIEs"" whether it's because ""they're allowing the rebels to escape"" or they're genuinely trying to get them, it's completely arbitrary and there's no consistency.

Even the twists are spontaneous and arbitrary - suddenly the film decided to ""reveal"" that ""Vader let them escape""; at some point it could've felt like revealing they ""let the Deathstar blow up"" and ""that was the explanation for the ease of their victory"" and then suddenly the ""just 9 TIEs vs. 30"" would have that explanation lol.

&nbsp;

>>Oh ok just ""low IQ due to emotional bias obsession in ep5"" then - still no indication for such a portrayal in the movie, though.
> 
> There absolutely is. Rather than pursuing any of the main rebel transports, Vader bears down on the Millennium Falcon with his entire fleet of warships.

Huh pursue them where? They manage to escape and jump to lightspeed thanks to that ion cannon etc., they're gone lol - just like the Falcon is at the very end.

And yes in the 1st half of ANH it was still possible to ""pursue"" ships through hyperspace, but not anymore in this movie, it got retconned.

>>Some damage, but they could live with it.

>So what? Them taking damage was entirely unnecessary. **This was clearly stated in the film to be an illogical move. Now, who is coming up with the headcanons?**

""Clearly stated"" when and by whom? Completely inventing lines out of thin air and then accusing others of headcanon, now how rich is that lol

>>Oh ok, too few TIEs, but also the entire fleet.

>**That only proves my point that Vader wasn't acting logically.** And if you are being sarcastic, that just proves that you don't actually know the films well at all, because we see many imperial warships in the asteroid field, so yes, Vader brought his fleet into the asteroid field.

Well turns out you're the headcanonist after all.

Sure his actions don't hold up under scrutiny, but that doesn't automatically mean that's how they were portrayed and his irrationality was a plot point - and there seems to be no indication for that here.

&nbsp;

>>There was some satellite dish or something that exploded, and the entire ship was taken down, though I don't recall that.

>That wasn't a satellite dish that exploded. That was the ship's bridge tower, which is where everything is controlled from. Even if that didn't kill everyone on board, the ship would either be dead in space or the still active engines would cause it to collide into more asteroids.

Ah ok then, fair enough. So a bit more personnel-and-equipment-fleet-sacrificey than I thought then.

>Either way, it would be extremely difficult to recover the ship, and the crew would have to evacuate. All because Vader wanted to capture a single ship.

That ship was important and the key to getting the big hero enemy guy who had to be taken down (or recruited).

&nbsp;

>>it was a really obvious thing to think of.

>**According to the movie, no, it wasn't.** Also, it wasn't just that the Falcon hid on their hull. It was that there was a blind spot in their scanners. For whatever reason, Han and Boba are the only 2 to know about this blind spot.

Ah well of course, that's what I said:

>>Although it wasn't presented as stupidity, but rather ""Han was just that brilliant and Bobafett was extra brilliant / knew the smuggler pirate tricks particularly well"" or something like that.

If somehow them not knowing that there is or might be a blindspot (or being unable to think of this after just having seen the ship fly at them and immediately vanish from their scanners) can be made to make any sense, then maybe this is comparatively less absurd than if it can't.

And of course the moment anyone thought of such a possibility, they could've started scanning via the other ships next to the Avenger, or started checking out the hull visually or via TIEs etc. - just like they should've done in TLJ with Crait, just thought of using the ""decloaking scan"" or used binoculars if nothing else worked.

&nbsp;

>>Well originally it was Needa's since that happened with Needa's stardestroyer (i.e. the ""Avenger"")

>No, because Vader's fuck up allowed Han to do so. Vader even chasing the Falcon with an entire fleet was a huge waste of Imperial resources, 

Uhh ok even if so (and no, the goal was important enough), *that* hardly could've led to reduced chances of catching Han or preventing him from pulling off that hull trick lol

>and also he didn't launch nearly enough fighters to search for the Falcon effectively, leaving all the work to Needa and his big, slow ISD.

They don't really show nearly enough of where all the different Stardestroyers are for you to be able to tell that - they were just uhhh, in various parts around the asteroid field, and Needa's (whose ship wasn't said by anyone to be ""slow"") was just the one the Falcon happened to run into / get picked up by while escaping from the monster.

""Didn't launch enough fighters"" well he did only send 4 before the asteroid field - afterwards we're not really shown how many were sent, but if too few were sent then that'd just fit the general pattern wouldn't it?  
And yeah could've also used the probe droids maybe.

Public utilities and resources, are naturally better run publicly as long as the public institutions are low corruption. People may complain about corruption here, but we are a low corruption country. This is why electricity and gas are such shambles in this country. Gas is now a calamity in the waiting because of how thoroughly broken the privatised system is.

We have allowed American Capital to dominate our resources sector and suck wealth out of the country. And make no mistake, our mining and financial sector is dominated by American Capital. The debate between nationalisation and continued privatisation is debate of sovereignty.  


It juvenile to boil everything down to government = inefficient, private sector = efficient. Many government institutions around the world are quite efficient. Others, are  not. Same goes for the private sector. See Boeing, who if not for stealth State Aid [generous Pentagon contracts] would be in serious trouble.

You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.

The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.

When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.

No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.

I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.

You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.

You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.

Even this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.

Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.

In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.

You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.",1711929748.0

For a time reallocated some into ARKK and ARKW thinking it would bubble and pop (it did) and got lucky with the timing on both sides.¬†

Allocated more to big tech, mostly MSFT and NVDA. Also got lucky there.¬†

Nearly all has been shifted back to VTI except for about 30% still in MSFT/NVDA (need to rebalance).¬†

Last 3 years beat S&P by 105%.¬†

Due to continued investment and not taking anything out, along with lucky timing and bets we are doing ok.

I wouldn't have done much differently except not taken the ARK ride. Too much daily checking of tickers and news, not good for my mental health even though we came out positive.¬†

The big part is to not be fearful when everyone is. Stare it in the face and go harder. If it really is the end of the world then none of matters anyway lol.¬†",1711929749.0
"NBATalk","t5_4tzb0i","Kobe. All he really did was shoot a LOT. Kobe was a better than average distance shooter and solid on free throws. But overall he was the overall league wide shooting percentage of every player ever has averaged to 45.4% FG. Kobe was a career 44.7% FG. And he only ever hit over 45.4% in 8 of his 20 years. Meaning that for most of his career, 12 years of his 20 year career or 3/5 Kobe shot BELOW average. 

He DID shoot above average from 3. But even then he was shooting 32.9%. By comparison:

Larry Bird was 49.6% FG and 37.6% from 3. 

Reggie Miller was 47.1% FG and 39.5% from 3. 

And it‚Äôs not even just that other superstars put up better stats check out Kobe‚Äôs 44.7% FG and 32.9% 3pt shooting against guys like:

Wally Sczerbiak: 48.5 FG% and 40.6% 3pt. 

Boris Diaw: 49.3% FG and 33.6% 3pt

I don‚Äôt think Kobe sucks. But how can you constantly be in the ‚ÄúGOAT‚Äù/‚ÄúHeir to Jordan‚Äù argument ALL THE TIME and meanwhile in the ONLY stat category you really excelled at Boris Diaw and Wally Sczerbiak (both good but not generally considered great) are CLEARLY statistically better. 

It would be different if Kobe pulled a massive number of boards per game or a ton of assists but he‚Äôs pretty average nearly across the board. You could have taken nearly any player in league history and just fed them the rock like Kobe and they‚Äôd have a stat line like his. 

IMO that makes Kobe the most overrated player ever. He was good but not one of the greatest all time. He got a lot of rings but if you put me on teams with Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal and Pau Gasol and had supporting players like Derek Fisher, Rick Fox and Robert Horry I might have some rings too.",1711929749.0

**Please read this entire message**

# Your title should provide a physical description of the object. 

Pretend you are describing it over the phone to someone who cannot see the photo(s). We realize you may not know all of these, but include things like this in the title:

* Size
* Shape
* Weight
* Color
* What it's made of 
* If anything is written on it
* If anything moves
* If it appears to be electronic, needs batteries, lights up
* If it makes a noise

You may include where it was found, *if it's relevant*.  ""Found six inches underground on a farm in Kansas"" may be relevant. ""Found in my friend's new flat"" is probably not relevant. 

# Do **not** include things like this in the title:

* Who used to own it
* Speculation on what it is
* A question like ""what is this"" or statement like ""I don't know what this is.""  That is always assumed.
* Adjectives that don't describe the item in a meaningful way, such as ""weird"", ""strange"", ""odd"" and similar.
* Family member mentions (this is to avoid public disclosure of family activities/history people may not want public)

# Finally: 

Once you submit your thing, it is held for moderation, and you need to read and follow the private message you'll get from Automoderator regarding what you need to do for the submission to go live.

I‚Äôm sorry for how he made you feel and misinformation he is telling you and probably others. Get a new therapist. There are therapist out there who specializes in trauma and ptsd backgrounds that will help you get that guidance you are looking for but also be constructive and understanding and give accurate and appropriate care. 
You suffered from severe abandonment by both parents not only with a parent intoxicated and addicted to substances but an absent one by unfortunately passing, which is putting you the child to grow up and be in survival mode which is what ptsd and cPTSD stems from. Abandonment is a huge reason many have ptsd and cPTSD. Not to mention trauma is a major contributor to people using substances which you stated you also have.

OP, I am so sorry your dad isn't listening to you. Your feelings are valid. Your decision to not meet them doesn't need a reason. If you said, ""No, I don't want to."" - that should be good enough. This is your life and about your feelings. Your dad doesn't get to tell you how to feel or what to think. Your dad is acting like your feelings don't matter.

Usually in such places men congregate around lunch time or after work and 'do stuff' with each other while watching dirty movies and you had to put tokens in the tv's in the little booths to have the movies play. 

There was a really great one in Woodbridge, New Jersey on Rt. 1&9 probably 20+ years ago but the police raided it in an election year so it 'looked tough' on that sort of sex spot. It never was the same after.

The spots in New York, always seemed to be staffed by homophobic middle-eastern men who looked strung out on drugs. Maybe it was just me, but they were never friendly and came off as aggressive. It was never welcoming.",1711929750.0

"Maher","t5_38r3o","Bill's covid derangement syndrome makes it hard to be a fan. This New Rules was replete with misrepresentations, exaggerations, and straw men. Too many to address, so I'll just focus on this gem from him:
He claims this was the narrative pushed on the public: *""Natural immunity is always the worst kind.""*


Who TF in any position of authority said that? I never heard it once. Stop straw manning. What I heard/read was the perfectly reasonable assertion that the vaccine could _boost_ immunity for those who had already caught the virus. And that is absolutely true ‚Äì we learned pretty early on that covid immunity only lasts months, not years.


Also, what's good about mRNA vaccines is that the spike protein signature can be easily modified to match different strains. Like the flu, covid mutates, so getting it once doesn't mean you can't catch a different strain just weeks later. There's never a 100% guarantee of anything with viruses and vaccines, but responsible public figures will advocate for the greater good. To even imply that the majority of the public would somehow be worse off taking the vaccine is just irresponsible.


Whether Bill intends to or not, he implies that the vaccine is somehow bad, but the data clearly shows many people have benefitted from it. Seems like the shutdown really did a number on him. Honestly, he kinda behaves like someone with PTSD on this topic, and people with PTSD generally have extreme reactions to the thing that induced the trauma.",1711929751.0

"Leathercraft","t5_2sufa","I've been thinking about doing something similar too. There's a lot to consider. 

A) time. Depending on the age and skill level of attendees you probably will need more time than you expect. Especially if it's their first time doing something. 
B) sharp objects and liability. You'd like to think most adults can handle a pair of scissors but you'd be surprised. And I definitely would not want to give utility knives to people right away. But, if you're doing a bag or belt or purse etc you may have no other choice but to give people some amount of sharp objects. 
C) prep time. say you're doing a bag from a pattern, so you cut them all out ahead of time or make that part of the lesson? Do you bring enough material that every person can do something? I'd you're cutting out the pattern how many do you make? How do you know you won't be short or over commiting?
D) space. Are you doing this at your own shop? How many people can you for into your shop? Are you renting a room at a community centre? How are you transporting your materials to the site? Why if you forget something at home? 
E) marketing.  How will you advertise? How Will you recruit assistants? How do you know how many people to expect.

I'm probably forgetting something but this is what come to my mind",1711929751.0

"gamecollecting","t5_2s8fe","It really is crazy that consumers are allowing companies that make video games and dvd/bluray discs to take our paid for items away from us when ever they feel like it.¬† So they can sell us their new product. Or edit the movies/TV shows whenever they get into trouble or think they will loose money.¬†


I haven't bought a new video game since the whole Xbox one launch (research it if you don't know about it). The newest console I own is Wii. I really only play ps2, Nes & Genisis.¬†


I love TV shows and I'm forced to buy bootleg versions of the Disney shows and alot of other new shows because these companies want to rent them to us on the streaming site, than let us own them and watch whenever we want to.¬†


Research how the movie companies responded and acted when the VCR was introduced. They are acting almost similar now tring to regain total control of when and how people watch their content. Before the vcr the¬†movie and TV companies had 100% control over how and when people watched their content. Movies you had to go to movie theater and TV you only had the TV channel broadcast. When movies were first put on video tape they were $100+. The movie companies thought no one would pay that to own a movie. That's why rental places became so popular.¬†


Now the movie companies all have a streaming site and only release the movies on physical media for a little while shortly after movies are in theaters and then in special editions here and there when they think they can make the most money on it. Some have totally stopped like disney in Australia.¬†


I either buy the movies on first release or used at a later point or buy bootlegs. Luckily I dont have to buy too many bootleg movies yet only tv shows. I subscribe to no streaming services and never plan to. I haven't even had cable since 2004.


These days everyone are saying they cut the cable. Meaning they don't have cable TV anymore but they are just exchanging one for another cause these people have 2 or 3 streaming sites. I didn't have cable when there were no streaming to exchange for cable. I bought dvds and the occasional bootleg download. And I refuse to ever rent a game download (I say rent cause it's not a purchase since they can take it whenever they want).¬†",1711929753.0

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

 They did not divorce, though Sulla demanded he do so. Sulla gave Caesar a means of escape, and Caesar needlessly agitated the Dictator and was forced to flee for his life.

Caesar's inheritance through his father was forfeited. He did not give this up it was stripped from him, though the intercession of his mother and a Vestal kept him from being proscribed.

When he returned to Rome, he attempted several prosecutions against supporters of Sulla he argued had illegally profited from the Dictatorship. He lost all of these cases. After these very public embarrassments, he went back to school to learn rhetoric, was kidnapped by pirates, and from there was taken under Crassus' guidance and went from being a needlessly aggressive punk to a much more subtle political operator.",1711929755.0

"Christian","t5_2qjy5","Seek God and pray for wisdom. Learn to wait for His answer with patience, and keep a bible at hand :)

I started off like you, just listening to preachers but never learning, so I prayed often He would lead me closer. It took eight years of wandering, but He set the path ahead of me. Made me join the church volunteer to help sermons, then brought me out of the church and found me a bible study group with some friends of my dad and after learning what I could there, He allowed me out to study and ponder His wisdom on my own with the Holy Spirit and my experience living with Him.

Our faith bears fruit when we seek Him with our whole heart. Seek to be guided by the Holy Spirit, but learning to wander with Him is largely experience and hearing or reading the new testament. 

To grow your direct faith and closeness to God, start faithfully in small things! Little good deeds for friends and family and strangers to honour Christ's name, and slowly root out the sins you can overcome. The Holy Spirit gives us strength when we ask or it is time to overcome the difficult ones. We all have a measure of faith, use it so God may let it grow!",1711929755.0

"Flipping","t5_2y9q6","If you have been at it for 20 years then you would know that accepting returns comes with more than just a small fee discount. As a matter of fact, you got that part wrong too. The small discount is for Top Rated Plus, not for just accepting returns.

The other thing you would realize is that the benefit of accepting returns and being standard top rated is that when someone pulls some shit like this, you are guaranteed to get at LEAST 50% of your money back by withholding 50% of the refund, as well as them not being able to leave you a negative feedback.

By not accepting returns, a buyer is then just forced to lie about the return reason, and then when you get those trashed returns, be it from bad packaging or the buyer breaking the item, you get to eat 100% of the cost when eBay excuses themselves from the conversation. 

Not only that, you don't get the occasional honest buyer who pays for their return shipping since they can return things for remorse reasons instead of remorse returns disguised as INAD returns to get around the no return policy.

Ironic, in a way, that they make one whole party; Tank = Thancred, Healer = Urianger, PhysDPS = Estinian, MagDPS = Yshtola.

Alphie and Alisae lack experience and raw power, though they can hold their own. G‚Äôraha could be up there with the others, but only if he is able to access the Crystal Tower.

Virs nu luhr√°t-ul, √∂ izy lyar nu a-luhr√°t

About not to.work-ACC, 3SG too clearly not PAST-to.work


Kastelian nominalizes the past participle of the verb ""to work"" (a luhr√°) and declines it accordingly to say ""to have worked"" or ""working"". The pronouns are not gendered in Kastelian, but an additional suffix ""-√§"" could be inserted to ""√∂"" to specify feminine gender (turning it into ""√∂√§"" /Àào.…ô/, 3SG.F). 


Note that this is just one (probably one of the most common ones too) of the many forms one could use in Kastelian to express double clauses. An alternative that reassembles a little bit more the other romance languages would be:

Virs a nu luhr√°, √∂ izy lyar nu a luhr√°t.

/vi…æs a nu luÀàx…æa | o(Àê) iz ≤  éa…æ nu a luÀàx…æat/

When all of the augments I want are done, I'll swap back to Warrior and train my pawn to Warrior with both max weapons and armor in ng++. We'll just roam together as a Warrior duo and I will train him well.

This game is way too much fun to not play more. I dont care about the story, npcs, characters etc. I just wanted gameplay and this game's gameplay is top notch so I'm happy. Will be a lot more happier when we get a dlc like dark arisen.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","How is it passive aggressive in the least?  She didn't try to humiliate daughter/dad.    She let them take all the credit, and never raised it at all.

THEY are the ones claiming that THEIR failure to be even minimally involved enough with their mother/wife to know what she might like is somehow her fault.  That's pretty damned passive aggressive to say the least.

They stood around letting everyone else think this fabulous event was their doing, without even a little ""oh, mom did a great job this time, didn't she?"" acknowledgement. 

She (mom) let it all slide. Until THEY brought it up, solely to assuage their own guilt. 

Yes, people throwing a party or event are responsible for bothering to *ask the recipient what they might like.*  That's not saying they have to provide the whole thing themselves, but the total lack of engagement is solely on D&D.

The P-A people here are definitely D&D, not mom.  She just went out and planned something when it became obvious they weren't going to do anything she might like themselves *because they weren't even making an effort to know*.

And note this is a PATTERN. Neither daughter nor dad have asked in the past about this, and just blindly assumed (again, without asking) that their efforts were satisfactory.  

You know, it's not Mom that's a total failure at communication here. Or basic emotional awareness. Or social graces.",1711929759.0

"Santeria","t5_2wgbs","It depends how the fruit flies are getting in. Sometimes they lay eggs on the fruit at the market, and you bring them home. You should wash/ disinfect the fruit well to be sure they're free of the eggs. Sometimes they come in through a crack under the door or around the window or even through the drain. They can be attracted to moist things like mops or sponges or organic garbage under the sink. Check to see if you have them all over the house, or just where you leave the fruit for Elegua. You want to make sure the fruit isn't overripe or fermenting. It shouldn't have any kind of opening in the skin/ peel. Wash the dish where you put the fruit very well. Don't leave the offerings too long, and don't put them in the direct sun or in a really warm place. If you take all these precautions and still have fruit flies, then stop giving fruit for a while. Mine doesn't take fruit as a normal rule, but sometimes as ebo I put fruit down. Otherwise, I give him candies, little sweet pastries, a small toy or two.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Your mom is manipulating you. It‚Äôs like the saying ‚Äúif everyone you meet is an asshole, you might be the asshole‚Äù‚Ä¶you are able to maintain relationships with these people, and she is not. That is not your fault, and you shouldn‚Äôt be made to feel bad for it. 

Do you feel that your aunt is an appropriate person to be around you and your family? If so, then tell your mom that. Do you feel that your step-dad is an appropriate person to be around you and your family? If so, then tell your mom that. Her history with these people has nothing to do with you, and you have a right as an adult to choose who you associate with. From the sounds of it, your mom has a lot bridges burned with a lot of people. You can‚Äôt live your life scared to see your aunt or your step-dad, or whoever, because your mom is going to be incensed by it - it‚Äôs not her choice, she already made hers. 

My parents are both wild cards like your mom. I have watched my dad, who has a long history of drug and mental issues, lash out at my aunt (his sister) and call her a liar of awful things because she wouldn‚Äôt keep sending him money - even though he is now in his 60‚Äôs and has not worked since his 40‚Äôs. My aunt is the most kind hearted and generous person I know, hard stop. My mom disowned her entire immediate family over some bullshit perceived slight (literally imagined she was owed something and was not), and wouldn‚Äôt even drop it for a few minutes when her sister‚Äôs husband was dying of cancer - ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pray for him‚Äù is all she said. 

You can‚Äôt reason with people like our parents. Set your boundaries, and live your life. They‚Äôre either going to get on board and swallow their pride so they can be a part of gatherings like this, or they‚Äôre going to stick to their principles and be fine with not being there. It‚Äôs not your responsibility to sort it out",1711929759.0

[Nota Original](https://www.newssmex.com/2024/03/infonavit-si-dejas-de-trabajar-pierdes.html) | Reducido en un 59.75%

*****

> El ahorro de la Subcuenta de Vivienda del Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores (Infonavit) se genera con las aportaciones que hace el empleador cada bimestre, que es el equivalente al 5% del salario del trabajador.

> No obstante, esto no significa que el dinero acumulado en la Subcuenta de Vivienda se pierda.

> Es importante mencionar que el trabajador puede cambiar de empleador y seguir acumulando ahorros en su Subcuenta de Vivienda.   

> El ahorro de la Subcuenta de Vivienda puede usarse para obtener un cr√©dito Infonavit para comprar una casa o terreno, construir una vivienda, realizar mejoras o reparaciones al hogar mediante financiamientos o pagar una deuda hipotecaria.

> En caso de fallecimiento del trabajador, sus beneficiarios pueden solicitar la devoluci√≥n del dinero.

If this was your first time watching our government ""stimulate"", devalue, dilute away your purchasing power, it won't be your last.  We've been through three of these now.  That said, this last heist was the largest ever, and we're in the same boat... sinking.   It just ruins all of your plans and projects and calculations, everything.   In less than 3 years we lost over 40% of purchasing power.   Everyone knows what that feels like for their current wages, but for people in retirement or even 10 to 15 years from retirement, it has been utterly ruinous.  In the past, we were young enough and had enough health and time to work 2 and 3 jobs to rebuild, but you never truly recover from it.   Now, we're too old and time is running short.  I've no idea how we're going to rebuild this time.  In fact, it is so bad this time, that despite our 3 degrees and decades of experience, we are running up credit card debt on groceries.  We're literally financing food, and the rate hikes have caused the rates on our cards to skyrocket.  We're paying nearly $200 per month in interest on food with no end in sight.  So, we've resorted to slowly bleeding down retirement savings to keep our heads above water.

All to say, I can sympathize.  None of us can truly calculate what it will take in a climate like this, where about every 7 to 10 years, the government can and does stimulate away your purchasing power.  The whole damn system is rigged I think for that very reason, to create instability in the working class.  IF you're generationally wealthy and own rent-seeking assets and businesses, you're better off, and can raise prices to pad your cost of living hikes, but if you merely define your wealth in terms of dollars or have your money trapped in tax sheltered accounts, you're not diversified enough, and are at risk to these tactics.",1711929759.0

"balkans_irl","t5_n458w","Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.

In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.

You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.

It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.

Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.

I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.

The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.

Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.

You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.

If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.

You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.

The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.

I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.

When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.

My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.",1711929760.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Mine!! I just told a short version of this to someone asking about open marriage stuff. Here's the full tale:

Once upon a strip club, I did the thing you don't do -- I married my DJ. Oops.

Anyway.

I'm a dominant, and so was he. I could not play submissive in bed with him without bursting out laughing because I found his way or play to be fucking absurd. He was into that hypnosis shit, and my brain actually functioned -- but it wasn't until a few years into our time together that I learned that he actually BELIEVED he could control the minds of submissives (or anyone, really). Plus, I don't like being choked.

So, being the open-minded weirdo I am, I gave him the green light to get his shit out of his system with chicks he'd find on FetLife and such. These would typically be text or phone call sessions, which I find incredibly amusing. The first main girl told him that she was deeply programmed like a computer, and they were ""putting her under"" so he could try various Linux commands (his words) to gain primary user access.

You can't make this shit up, man. I'd listen to him doing this, furiously making notes, for hours. It was on speaker, so I got to hear her side too.

Anyway, so a few months go by and he says, let's call her Computer Bimbo (CB) -- CB is coming to visit ""us""  -- and I'm like, great. That's not weird at all. Turns out she has a fight with HER Dom, and blah blah, she drives four states over. I'm at work, and when I get home, she grabs a dildo out of her purse (because of course all us ladies have glass dildos in purses when we travel to see someone else's husband...) and says ""well, you got yours earlier, so it's only fair it I get off too"" while walking to the bathroom. Turns out he jerked off in front of her while they did, whatever. One of our rules is zero in-person sexual shenanigans without both of us present. So I shut that shit down, he apologized, and a year goes by without issue.

Until he meets the second girl. The star of this show. We'll call her Lilith. You'll see why at the end.

Same story, meets online, blah blah. At this point he's managing a bigger club and we were looking into buying a house. According to him, Lilith's sub kink was service, and she wanted to be our live-in submissive housekeeper.

üö©üö©üö©üö© I say. But he shrugs it off. He *knows what he's doing*, he says üôÑ. Ok. Whatever. In my mind, I'm thinking this is all a fantasy for this chick and there's no goddamn way some girl from Missouri is uprooting her life for a dude on FetLife and his wife in New Orleans (relevant). 

Yeeeahhh, and then she ""randomly"" showed up one night, also while I was working. I'm at work, and he says she'll be in the car when he picks me up. I asked him how she arrived -- she drove. But her car got impounded. Mmhmm. Boy, am I curious at this point.

My club closes, so I go out to get picked up. She's in the front seat. She doesn't immediately get out to move to the back for the also dominant wife of her Dom. Uh, no. Immediately, I knew shit was off. No submissive would ever dream of acting that way. Hell, some would offer to get in the damn trunk out of respect or walk (I'd never, but anyway). 

So, eyebrow raised in silence, I start stowing away my earnings -- just in case. I had a very, very bad feeling.

After we get home -- which is at a motel at the time, and BEHOLD, she has a room magically booked on the floor below -- he says, ""I'll be back in a minute, I'm gonna go read my sub a bedtime story.""

Naturally, he doesn't come back. I'm not dumb, but I'm buying a few days. Works been slow.

This happens every night for about three days, and then on the fourth day, I had several high-tier VIPs, so there was a decent amount of cash in my pocket. He also didn't show up to pick me up from work. Midnight through 3am, nothing. My manager had to drive me home because she didn't want me hailing a car with that kind of cash, plus she could tell that I was INSANELY upset. This woman had never seen me lose my cool in two years.

I get dropped off then realize HE has the goddamn key to the room. Knock on our door... Nothing. So I go to the front desk, and since this is a skeezy joint, the desk happily tells me not only which room she's in, but that HE paid for it and booked it for her (something he lied about outright). I thank him, and he's practically getting the popcorn ready to see what's about to happen.

So I knock on Lilith's door, and I hear ""oh shits"" and even the sound of hurried redressing (REALLY shitty place, you can hear someone practically shitting from the parking lot with how oversized the AC openings are), and I simply yell ""I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE FUCKING, I'M TIRED, TELL MY HUSBAND TO GIVE ME THE FUCKING KEY.""

He tries to say I'm wrong, but I just tell him I'm not an idiot. He has one chance to salvage this if he comes upstairs immediately, then he just calls me controlling and goes back to his toy (or so he thought -- ooooo foreshadowing). 

It wasn't until I got upstairs that I realized that they took both of my dogs to her room, which is the big regret of this tale for me... Uhg.

Anyway. As soon as morning hits, I go to the motel manager -- who didn't like him very much -- and got the room rekeyed and booked under my name with full permission to pile everything he owned by her door with zero issues. So that's what I did. A few days go by and they're at my door trying to break in to steal our gaming setup, that I bought. Cue to cops and things not going well for them.

A month goes by before they disappear. First she disappeared then he starts lurking around my work and my room trying to talk to me. I ignore everything.  Then he's gone too. Another few months go by until I got the rest of the story from one of the tarot readers who worked by his club. Btw, the street performers on Bourbon Street know EVERYTHING. 

Turns out he started bringing Lilith into his job every day, which was pissing off the strippers on his shift. She also had a coke habit (that rekindled HIS coke habit that he had 10 years of sobriety from), so he also started acting super fucked up -- beyond the acceptable level of cocaine fuckedupness that's kinda ok in that environment -- and began stealing from the girls AND the club for her. Barely two weeks after I ditch him, he made a huge scene during his firing and was blackballed from working anywhere on the strip. She stayed until she drained him dry, then left. Shocker,  I know.

Turns out, surprise surprise, Lilith was not a submissive looking for a Dom. She wasn't even from another state. She's a local con artist and my ex was the THIRD Dom that worked the strip club scene as a manager that she had hit (that we know of). She plays the same game, goes after guys in relationships, knowing that they are cash heavy with how the work is, destroys said relationship then bleeds them financially. 

I never laughed so hard in my life.

So, uh .. beware girls from the Internet, I guess.",1711929761.0

Scientific doesn't mean the scientific claim like water is made of H2O is falsifiable.

Your submission to our subreddit has been removed because your account hasn't met Contributor Quality Score (CQS) requirement and you do not have enough comment karma on our community. This is due to a limited history of positive comments in our community or concerns based on Reddit's overall assessment of account standing. See Additional information on our [Guide to CQS Scores](https://new.reddit.com/r/ThickDick/wiki/cqs/).  

How to post on our sub:

1. **Get Verified:** You can become a verified member of our community and bypass this restriction by following the verification instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThickDick/wiki/verification).
2. **Participate More:** Engage with the community through comments to naturally improve your standing. Positive interactions go a long way. Your score in particular requires you to comment on posts in our sub, we have a minimum karma requirement, and you have not met it yet. 
3. **Check Your CQS:** Curious about your current score? Comment in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThickDick/comments/16lerys/contributor_quality_score/) to find out and receive guidance on improving it.

**What is CQS?** Reddit uses factors like verified email, account age, posting patterns, known alternative accounts, and past actions on your account to determine if you're in good standing. This helps us keep our community safe and ensures a great experience for everyone.

---

^(1 Reddit determines whether or not someone is in good standing using a variety of signals including verified email, known alt accounts, and past enforcement actions taken on a user‚Äôs account. By aggregating these signals, we can attempt to predict good and bad actors, in an effort to help keep our community safe and improve the user experience.)

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","On July 1st, a [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) will come into effect. [Several developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. Limiting your involvement with Reddit, or
2. Temporarily refraining from using Reddit
3. Cancelling your subscription of Reddit Premium

as a way to voice your protest.

""As early as December 1943 SS officials in the Office for Jewish Emigration in Prague, an affiliate of the Reich Main Office for Security, decided to make a film about the camp. Much of it taken during the summer after the Red Cross visit, the footage depicts ghetto prisoners going to concerts, playing soccer, working in family gardens, and relaxing in the barracks and outside in the sunshine. The SS forced inmates to serve as writers, actors, set designers, editors, and composers. Many children participated in the film in return for food, including milk and sweets, which they normally did not receive.""",1711929762.0

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","Depends a lot on the fight.

Most of the time, the answer is going to be ""no"".

...

However...

There's three main reasons the answer is ""Yes"":

1) You die. Doesn't happen often - but it does happen.

2) You are left seriously injured - especially if it's a lasting injury. Slightly more common. Things like broken joints (knees and hands especially) can permanently limit your ability to work in the future.

3) You're held legally responsible. This is somewhat more common - though still relatively uncommon. But if the other person gets killed or hurt (and not even #2 hurt), this gets more common. And the people around (other person, local DA, or whoever) make a point of it, you can be in jail for months or years - even years into adulthood. Combine missing out on those young adult years of learning (either at college or at a job) with a felony on your adult record - both serious limitations (US - don't know how other countries deal with fights as a teenager) - and you could be short a lot of opportunities for the rest of your life.",1711929764.0

 GST in 1991/92 . The liberals ran their 93 election campaign against the conservatives and the GST . Much like the conservatives are running the same platform against the liberals today......  Kim Campbell stepped in and was the first female prime minister, then got smoked. The cons lost all but 2 seats.  But the liberals didn't reverse their course and repeal the GST.  Cause it works and they needed it. 

The government loves money, it needs money. It has to have money to support the services that we receive. We still have GST but someone had to be the villain to get it implemented.  The carbon tax most likely will still be here if PP gets elected, it's too crazy to believe that it will be swept away if it makes the government money.",1711929764.0

The person I replied to immediately blamed the MC's partner for setting off the MC-- essentially making the partner the villain. By making the partner the villain, it changes the majority of the story's theme. The core of the sadness isn't only that the MC has been abused (which is already tragic as it is), but there is also sadness in how the emotional damage of that very real situation is also causing further harm to the MC and theirs relationships further down the line. There is sadness in neither party involved being blameless. That their immediate thought was to blame the MC's partner not only makes the projection obvious, but it also makes it clear that they didn't fully understand the story itself.

Also, their response to the author being ""that could work too"" felt a bit dismissive.",1711929764.0

But also know that this is very common. Lots of people feel exhausted very easily by dating. However I personally think it‚Äôs a waste if you‚Äôre not fully engaged or excited to participate.

*****

> El ahorro de la Subcuenta de Vivienda del Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores (Infonavit) se genera con las aportaciones que hace el empleador cada bimestre, que es el equivalente al 5% del salario del trabajador.

> No obstante, esto no significa que el dinero acumulado en la Subcuenta de Vivienda se pierda.

> Es importante mencionar que el trabajador puede cambiar de empleador y seguir acumulando ahorros en su Subcuenta de Vivienda.   

> El ahorro de la Subcuenta de Vivienda puede usarse para obtener un cr√©dito Infonavit para comprar una casa o terreno, construir una vivienda, realizar mejoras o reparaciones al hogar mediante financiamientos o pagar una deuda hipotecaria.

> En caso de fallecimiento del trabajador, sus beneficiarios pueden solicitar la devoluci√≥n del dinero.

Given that you are the ‚Äúcurrent owner‚Äù of the house and your parents are now essentially ‚Äúguest‚Äù of the house, common sense should dictate there would a standard rule between the owner and the guest.

People will believe what their culture makes it easy to believe. You may think you can feel your thoughts occurring in your head, but you don‚Äôt have nerves or sensation inside your brain.

Pantsers mainly just don't plot much of the plot beforehand.

I see pantsing as being akin to improvising on an instrument, whereas plotting is more like composing and then performing a song in the more methodical yet proven traditional way. Can an improvised song be considered a masterpiece? Sure, of course! When recording, most musicians are much more apt to re-record improvised sections to get them just right, but some musicians are very good at consistently laying down the perfect lick on the first track or two.

>The Gospels' portrayal of Pilate is ""widely assumed"" to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo... in Josephus, by contrast, ""Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.""

>Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased.

>Bart Ehrman argues that the Gospel of Mark, the earliest one, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 19:16). He connects this change to increased ""anti-Judaism.""[88] 

>Raymond E. Brown argued that the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate cannot be considered historical, since Pilate is always described in other sources (The Jewish War and Antiquities of the Jews of Josephus and Embassy to Gaius of Philo) as a cruel and obstinate man.

The Romans were relatively uninvolved until the end because Judea was a client kingdom. Not because they were any less opposed to the movement forming around him.

It makes as much sense to portray Jesus as being in opposition to the Jewish leaders but not the Romans, as it does to portray Castro as being in opposition to Batista but not the US.",1711929765.0
