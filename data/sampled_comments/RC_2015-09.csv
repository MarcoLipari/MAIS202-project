"DnD","t5_2r9ei","/u/thedisquietedpen has summed up some good strategies.  Here is my take on this:

&gt; pre-roll damage 

No OR here for the DM.  It is provided in the MM and is a time saver.  Use it.  Not the players though, rolling damage is fun for them.

&gt;you have 5-60 seconds (I usually settle for ~15) to take your turn. 

Players need to start there turn with ""I move, I attack, I cast, I will...""  If they don't get it right out then they delay to the bottom of the init.  If they still don't have it then they defend.  In my opinion, your turn is not to be used to ask me how a power or spell works.  If you don't know, then your character doesn't know.  

One of my problems is the realization of what a spell REALLY does when I go to resolve it and then they want to take it back.  But I'm griping here.

&gt;keep initiative visible

Use index cards folded in half like tents and let your players manage this for you, they know how to write with markers and 'sort descending'

&gt;cut down on out of character talking in combat. 

Yea, this is hard to do but the phrase, ""That is about all you can convey to the group as a free action.  Anymore and chit chat will be your action.""

----

You are the level you are for the whole session when I start the session.  You had x days/weeks to level up...we have started.

Also, your group might not be the type to want lots of combat.  Go combat light for a while.  In 4e, the most I could pull off was usually 1 combat encounter and our record was 2.  Now 5e, I can get 2-4 in easy but they changed the game.","1441065600"

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Maybe not, but if the apartment was marketed with a pool, then not having one is significant.  The lack of a pool could be considered a material difference in what was represented when you signed your lease.  It's conceivable that if taken to a judge, the landlord would be required to either fix the pool, reduce the rent, or release the tenant from the lease.

It's unlikely the landlord will do any of these things short of being directed to by a judge.  Even with some sort of judgement, it's not likely that you'd be retroactively awarded anything.

Generally speaking, for any sort of complaint to have traction, you'd have to make your complaint in writing to the landlord.  Then give them enough time to reasonably remedy the problem after the formal complaint (this is not retroactive).  If they don't fix the problem, then you can seek a remedy through the court.

&gt;So no, using this example to demonize preorders as a whole is not dumb.

It definitely is. Just because I preorder, doesn't mean I support shitty preorder incentives. You can do one without doing the other. I don't like how Deus Ex preorder is being handled, so I don't preorder it. Simple as that.

&gt;No, but they are contributing to the anti-consumer practices

Considering how much bloodshed and destruction throughout history (and throughout the present) has been caused by people who desperately want power over others, I think this is not only a very reasonable position to take, but one that other communities and regions would do well to embrace also. 

They don't want to be ruled by the government, so they don't support them. They don't want to be ruled by the FSA, so they don't support them. But they also don't want to rule over all of Syria, so, as you say, they don't create a third faction with such a goal which would cause them to have to fight each of the first two factions. 

I believe it isn't that they want independence from Syria per se as much as they simply don't want to be ruled. And I think they are sincere with their statements that they would like to see all of the communities, ethnicities and religions in Syria have the same level of autonomy that the Kurdish communities are fighting to maintain -- and that they would be an ally to any people in the region who were fighting for similar goals.","1441065608"

"DC_Cinematic","t5_2ykm6","Well that's a very comprehensive question.  Actually multiple questions.  I can give you a few storylines I'd like to see. They're going to make 3 Batman movies with Ben Affleck and I would like to see one of those movies be a dedicated and nasty Joker story.  Maybe an adaptation of The Killing Joke or maybe the Joker graphic novel.  I really want to see Jared Leto's Joker interact with Affleck's Batman on a deeper level than just their stunt doubles in a car chase scene.  

I would also like to see new takes on old villains and to see some villains we've never seen in live action before.  I'd love to see one of the Batman movies include Ventriloquist.  I'd also love to see a Jason Todd/Red Hood storyline but who wouldn't?  

Other characters I hope to see...Black Manta, Poison Ivy, Bane, Bizarro, Parasite, Clayface, Grodd, Mr. Mind, Hugo Strange, The Black Mask, Chung Tzu (aka Egg Fu), Mary Marvel/Black Mary, The Black Hand, Monsieur Mallah and The Brain,  White Martians. ","1441065609"

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","Don't worry about being caught up in this.  IF there are no fees for selling (and you should check. I didn't see any on their website, but like I said, I could have missed them), then all it's cost you is time, really.  

And, even if there are fees for leaving early, it often makes sense to pay those fees in order to avoid the ongoing fees of a high MER.  Come back with the numbers, if there are any, and people here can do the math for you.

You do have plenty to learn and, like I said, I suggest you read a great deal of the entries on the CCP blog, as well as coming to this subreddit often and at least skimming lots of the submissions on investing.  To briefly touch on your questions:

&gt;because I thought I would need it for down payment on a new car or something after I graduate from college.

First off, don't buy a new car, and especially don't finance a car.  Cars rapidly depreciate in value, it's a much better financial decision to get a car that's 2 to 4 years old, and invest the difference.  The only good reason to buy a brand new car is if you're an enthusiast, and in that case you're probably buying some decked out Impreza or a classic, so....

It's good that the advisor gave you a survey about what risk you're comfortable with and what your goals are, though.  Do you understand the positive relationship between risk and returns, though?  Do you know that if things fall in value, that this is temporary and actually *positive* in the long run?   Volatility is the price of higher returns.  Hopefully that was explained.

&gt;I just want to know my next steps. I'm currently a few weeks in and the dip in the economy has resulted in a loss for my portfolio. Initially, I went in with intentions of doing GICs or High Interest Savings Account, are those better or worse compared to what I've invested in? 

Everyone's portfolios are down, right now.  Mine is. The proper course of action in such a situation is to just keep contributing as you normally would, contribute *more* than you normally would, or if you are not making current contributions just to relax and let time take care of it.

GICs and HISAs are fine if you *need* the money for a planned purchase in the near term (less than 5 years, say).  For example, you are actively searching for a house to buy, and are keeping the down payment ready.  Or you know your car is on it's last few kilometers, and you want $10k ready for a new (used) one.

If you've some flexibility, your portfolio is fine.  You want to get a bit of returns while you are saving up for that down payment, but you don't *have* to buy one, so that if your portfolio falls in value you can pass up a house you'd otherwise buy.

If you're saving for the long term, GICs and HISAs make no sense.  And a conservative portfolio should only be used if you are very risk averse or quite a bit older and your income from labour is going to be dropping off in a few years.

So, there's not really better or worse, here.  Just different products for different goals.

And, just to clear something up, when I say a ""conservative portfolio like yours"", that's still **not** a high-fee portfolio like you currently own, I mean a portfolio with that sort of bond-equity allocation, but with much lower fees.

&gt;Is it better to generally learn the market on your own and invest on your own, to avoid these ""conflict of interest"" scenarios?

Absolutely.  It's very easy to learn, and doing so will save you a great deal of money over the next 80+ years of your life.

&gt;Regarding the high commission fee. When do I have to pay that fee/when is that deduced/how is it deducted? And That's calculated based on the initial investment, right? 

It's ongoing.  What's important is that you stop paying it.

So, how do you go about actually dumping these silly funds you are currently in?

There's plenty of options.

1) You can open up an account with a discount brokerage such as Questrade, transfer your money over from TD, and buy the appropriate funds for your risk tolerance.

2) You can open up an account with a service like WealthSimple or WealthBar, and transfer out the money from the TD account.

Option 1 is the more complex one, but the fees are slightly lower.  Option 2 may be better for you, if learning how to DIY doesn't interest you, or you suspect you might be the sort of dude who gets worried when his portfolio drops a bunch in value.

There are other options like TD Waterhouse mutual funds, though I don't see the value in them over an ETF portfolio, and Tangerine funds, but they are still over a 1% MER and for that you may as well be using an advisor service like WealthBar or WealthSimple, IMO, and they are cheaper to boot.

What you want to *not* do is withdraw the money from your TFSA.  You need to transfer directly to another TFSA.  If you withdraw from the TFSA, you don't get that contribution room back until January 1st.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Wow, this was a long CMV! Let me try to respond here. Context: I'm an amateur music writer (write for The 405, Sputnikmusic, and now Popmatters), and love Christgau for the most part.

What Christgau did, first and foremost, was strip all the navel-gazing and meaningless pretention and art-for-art's-sake from music reviewing. He brought serious, punchy criticism into the realm of popular music, and allowed for level-headed appraisal of music that older critics would have snootily disregarded.

What I see you arguing, for the most part, is that he embodies a certain pettiness and sleaziness that's super undesirable in a critic, especially now. I'm not going to deny that in some cases. However, I don't think he's just poking fun at Doherty's drug addictions or Morrison's reputation for the most part - I see it as informing the music he's writing about. When he mentions Doherty's ""powder-sniffing,"" he's doing so in the context of what makes their album great, and when he mentions Morrison's ""slimeball"" nature, he's doing so to explain what either makes the album unenjoyable or great (LA Women, for example).

Here's where I think we diverge: it's impossible to totally separate the art and the artist - i.e. take the art in a total vacuum. This is pretty obvious in extreme examples, obviously - like, it's kinda tough to enjoy the Cosby Show now, and it's tough to listen to Lostprophets now that Ian Watkins has been convicted of pedophilia. However, in subtler cases the artist informs the art as well. This can be negative - try listening to Mark Kozelek's misanthropy without thinking of his general shittiness and occasional misogyny - and positive - would *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* have been quite so impressive without Kanye's general publicness and loudness?

And, obviously, it's possible - I know plenty of people who love Sun Kil Moon regardless of Kozelek's public actions. But not every critic wants to do that. Christgau is going to take the artist along with the art, though I don't think he really ever takes the artist in the art's *stead*, but I think they are impossible to extricate from one another. Occasionally, this is more obscure - the KoRn review, for example - but I think that even in those reviews the tone of the surrounding material almost ""makes"" the music: it's a shitty aesthetic, and that shittiness extends through to the music as well (image above boring ""death-industrial,"" leading to boring and dumb music).

And, yeah, occasionally his stuff is unwarranted. His Karen O thing is bad, which is why I think that having someone like Jess Hopper in command of P4K is important (even if I generally dislike her writing and self-importance). However, he's a caustic dude in a largely caustic-dude-centric field - I won't forgive him for his sexism, but I can at least understand where it comes from.

So, in conclusion: Christgau is great primarily because of how he transformed music writing, especially in how he (IMO) tastefully balances art and artist. Nitpicking like you're doing there is fair, but it's a little like nitpicking DJ Shadow's *Endtroducing.....* for sounding a little dated in 2015 when all the 2015 instrumental hip-hop wouldn't exist without it. He's praised largely for his influence, especially in terms of tone and brevity, and for that I have to give him the credit he's due.","1441065610"

Thanks. I suppose, if I was really challenged on the issue of my lack of sources, I would point to StarTrek.com itself as my source. The official website for Star Trek, owned and operated by the primary owner of the rights to Star Trek, has to be taken as a very strong guide to what is and is not canonical.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","Obviously those were all quick summations, ""anti-immigration,"" in the fleshed out model, refers more to a system based on intellectual merit instead of physical characteristics (we happily welcome people with any colour of skin, if they believe in gender equality and eschew anti-intellectualism, for example). 

Pro-nuclear  is essentially a stop gap measure intended to prevent the delay of existing and winding up nuclear projects. Being anti-nuclear is de facto pro coal/oil/gas, as current renewables such as solar and wind cannot provide baseload power, but nuclear  in combination with renewables provides a very flexible grid. Pro-nuclear also means not quashing further nuclear research, which will lead us to nuclear fusion which we'll absolutely need to power the second half of this century. So we'd actually be working to avoid your peak uranium scenario. Nuclear waste is obviously a serious issue, but in classic human fashion, it's all about kicking the can down the road. The industrial revolution has kicked us the can of carbon emissions, and we have to deal with that right now or face destruction. We'll have to deal with nuclear waste, too, but we desperately need to avoid the pending acidification of the oceans and a whole host of other issues that come with  a warming climate.

Geothermal, hydro, renewable, and fusion power will hopefully supplement nuclear fission so that we only need it for one generation. ","1441065612"

You can even stop Vi ult by killing her before she connects (that's kind of hard though). Also, I forgot Hecarim ult, it's also a dash that can pass over Azir wall.

Let's run the permutations.  Take together all the different combinations of the tiers for the [Day One Edition](https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/284036/deus-ex-mankind-divided-day-one-edition-pc-download) and we've got 12.  Multiply that by 3 since we have three system options: 36.  The [Collector's Edition](https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/289213/deus-ex-mankind-divided-collectors-edition-pc) (which doesn't include the 4-day-early release) has 9 possible combinations.  9 * 3 = 27.  Add that to the Day One Edition and we get 63.

There are 63 different ways you can preorder Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and that's only if all the tiers get unlocked.

63 ≠ ∞.

Edit: Turns out the Collector's Edition includes all preorder bonuses listed; no tier system.  Meaning you've only got 3 options there.  3 + 36 = 39.  So there are even fewer ""possibilities"" than before.","1441065613"

"ABDC","t5_2u1d2","I think they really had a tough job this season.  Everyone compared them to the old judges and complained why we had new ones.  But it was obvious that there needed to be an un-bias perspective from the 3 judges to critique returning superstars.  Not only that, but its so hard to critique those who are already deemed ""champions"" by the show.  How do you criticize them without basically defaming the idea that they are ""champions"", in which the show focuses so much attention on.  I feel the critiques came off too light because of that, and also because of lack of experience I'm sure.

But overall I thought they did a good job, Frankie definitely surprised me and gave the most cohesive and understandable notes.  I almost wish at the end that the judges got to decide who the winner was, because we would've actually received, imo, a more fitting champion for this season.  No hate on Quest, i love them.  But if I were to isolate my bias to them and look solely on who really grew and worked on pushing boundaries, I don't think I could confidently crown them. 

But the judges, I think they did a fair job.  Congrats to T-Pain, Teyana and Frankie.  Good season guys!","1441065614"

Are you going in the summer? Are you going to be outside most of the time (like at Disney or Universal)? 

If it's in the summer, then yes, expect that kind of temperature. It also rains a lot, usually either for a short amount of time mid-afternoon or a pretty sizable thunderstorm. In the winter, it's a pretty comfortable temperature and doesn't rain much.

If you're inside, there will be AC, and places are pretty good at keeping it at a comfortable temperature (unlike some places, where malls and restaurants crank it up so high you need a coat).","1441065618"

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Okay, now that we more or less agree on the current definition of vegan, the only question left is whether not killing ""sentient beings"" suits ethical framework better than ""animals"".

&gt;Sentience doesn't only require ability to sense, but a conscious experience of those senses

M-W defines *sentient* as  ""responsive to or conscious of sense impressions"". If something can feel and respond, it is sentient. This is different from consciousness or mental reasoning. So yes, it applies to both plants and animals.

&gt;My thought experiment was a hypothetical conscious plant

If you mean consciousness, it's a more abstract and difficult conversation as there is no broadly accepted scientific definition or understanding of consciousness. Presence/absence of brain/CNS does not imply consciousness either. There is no physiological root science have been to pin it down to...so you have to go with intuitive understanding (not definition).

&gt;My personal experience with talking to non-vegans is that it's been easier for me to explain my morals this way

If it works great, I'm all for any means to get the message through. I find that more people are conscious of health (what's in it for me) and sustainability (what's in it for my children), so I advocate from this perspective.","1441065622"

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt;The reason feminists often discuss sexualization has nothing to do with anything inherently wrong with it, but due to the ubiquity and contextual inappropriateness of it.

Let's talk about that then. I'll be generous and assume you're talking solely about video games here because sexualized characters are far from ubiquitous in all other forms of media (and arguably in video games as well but for the sake of conversation I'll grant it to you). 

First, lets think about what is *contextually appropriate* for a video game. As an convenient example we could look at Mika from Street fighter. What is the context here? We could look at her profession -professional wrestling- for context. As noted in another comment chain a google image search for female professional wrestlers gives a lot of contextual support for her highly sexualized outfit (note, she is not a luchador, she's a professional wrestler in the American/Japanese style.) 

But we can go deeper than that. On a more fundamental level, Mika is an avatar for us, the player, to interact with the game world. This is not just any game world, this is the world of a fighting game. In that context, players will want avatars that are powerful and skilled. You would expect most avatars to be idealized depictions of the human form with a sprinkling of joke characters depending on the franchise. Does Mika's design make sense in this context? I would argue that a healthy figure, bright eyes, developed skills, and sexual desirability are all aspects of the idealized female form.

Thus, Mika's design makes sense on two different contextual levels: as a professional wrestler, and as an idealized avatar. 

Onward to ubiquity. The claim is that there is a ubiquitous portrayal of women as being sexually desirable in video games, and that the issue is the aggregate. You bring up a hypothetical constant portrayal of black people as thugs and criminals as an example, which would have obvious negative repercussions. The analogy falls apart, however, when stretched to include being sexually desirable. Being a criminal is a negative trait. Being considered sexually desirable is commonly seen as a positive trait. It doesn't follow that exposure to lots of sexy women would have a negative impact on women. ","1441065623"

People in Alentejo have their own subset of jokes in Portugal all of them making fun of how lazy they are (e.g. Two alentejanos are sitting by the porch when one if them spots a 50€ note on the ground 10 meters away.

It now uses (making up these numbers of course just for example) 50 grams of plastic per bottle instead of 100 grams (by making the bottle walls thinner, a different shape that holds more volume, etc).  Since they buy plastic at $0.001 a gram, they are saving 5 cents per bottle made. Multiple that by the 100 million bottles a year they make, and they are now saving 5 million dollars a year.

Keep in mind that the staff at DTRPG aren't publishing things. Publishers have accounts and once they have a history with DTRPG they can publish titles on their own. DTRPG is just the delivery system publishers are using.

So in this case a publisher published something, the internet blew up and yelled at DTRPG who then talked to the publisher who pulled the product.

One of the main factors of death of a spaceman is that your character can only suffer so many injuries and can only be rebuilt so much before the body gives out and they die permanently.

In your example, if you can get together 3000 of those 10 000 voters to vote in unison then that sounds like a great idea. But the actuality of the situation is that getting 30% of all voters together to vote in unison is impractical.

You are sucked in and brainwashed by the ploy, ""you can make a difference."" The truth is that your vote doesn't affect the outcome of an election. Your 0.00001% of the presidential election votes will never turn overcome the tide.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","Not sure I agree with the win more sentiment. Win more, to me, generally refers to playing cards that are powerful when you already have inevitability on your side. Midrange Hunter generally feels like you're in the beat down role and the opponent is just hoping to stabilize before the game ends. Inevitability is usually on the opponents side.  Moreover against aggro you aren't playing many taunts, so you don't have inevitability on your side there either. 

My problem with Ram is that the bad draws are just way too bad. Getting a Stonetusk Boar is just crippling. For a deck that looks to clock the opponent by turn 6, I'd rather just play a Tiger or Loatheb which is guaranteed to accelerate the clock. ","1441065634"

Things in the fighter world move so quickly that when the echo comes back it comes back a different frequency just like how a train's horn sounds higher pitched as it's coming towards you and as it moves away from you the pitch gets lowered.  

A fighter jet's radar sometimes has to look at targets below it which means the majority of the returns are going to be from the ground passing below it; since the jet knows how fast it's going and it knows what frequency it's radar operates at it can determine what frequency the radar return will be by determining how much it will have doppler shifted.  It will then ignore all returns that are close to that range","1441065636"

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","I would very strongly recommend this option. If you have cloth-wrapped wires, you definitely want to pull new wires. But if you do that, there are a lot of other changes that you can do at the same time. They won't cost much more, but there is no incentive for the seller to do these upgrades. So, you are much better off, if you are the one who sets the exact scope of the project.

I recommend making sure you have enough outlets. Modern building codes require outlets every couple of feet, and they do so for good reason. People have a lot more electrical devices than they used to have. A 50 year old house is likely to have way too few outlets.

Also, when installing outlets I strongly encourage you to put quads everywhere, instead of the regular duplex outlets (i.e. install a 2-gang box in put in two duplex outlets each). I personally prefer Decora over toggle style, but that's your call. In places where you expect to have a lot of devices (e.g. behind the TV, under the office desk, maybe even kitchen counter tops) put multiple quads. This way, you won't need to plug in tons of power strips. None of this should cost a lot at all.

If you are stringing new wires anyway, consider running CAT5e or CAT6 homeruns to some central location (e.g. garage or some closet). The material is about $30-50 dollars from Amazon (just try to find solid Copper instead of Copper-Clad-Aluminum), and you don't even need to hook it up to anything at this time. But you'll be happy if your electrician puts it into the walls for you at this time.

In the garage, install a 240V outlet next to the breaker panel. This costs only another $30 in parts, but it'll come in super handy if you ever need to plug in any high-powered tools. Your future contractors will thank you.

A 100A service is probably good for now. But it'll be a bit of a nuisance if you at some point have multiple electrical cars. And there is a decent chance that we'll all have those in the future. You won't be able to power quick chargers with just a 100A service. In fact, when we recently upgraded our electrical panel, we ended up getting 400A service for this very reason. Around here, that's become very common for new construction of bigger houses.

You can always install a new panel and new service later, but you'll save some money if you do everything in one go. It's really your call though. If money is tight, 100A service should serve you fine for at least the next couple of years.","1441065637"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Transfers- Similar to trades.  NFL operates on a weekly schedule of games.  Trades can be made from the start of the league year (sometime in March) until week 8 of the regular season (sometime in late October or early November). Players can be traded for other players or for future draft picks in the NFL draft (takes place in late April or early May).  Players can't be bought like in soccer.

Age- no set minimum age but NFL players have to be three years removed from High School which effectively makes the youngest players around 20 sometimes as young as 19.  Most NFL players play college football for the NCAA before they are eligible to play in the NFL.

Fixtures- The NFL has 32 teams organized into two 16 team conferences where each conference has four 4 team divisions.  Every team plays two games one at home and one away against the other  three teams in their division.  The other ten games of a season are comprised of ten individual opponents that they play only once and thus only play them at home or away.  The other ten games are broken down by playing two entire divisions for 8 games in total.  Teams play one division in the same conference as them and one in the opposing.  The last two games are decided by how last year's standings ended up.  I'll explain this with an example.  The New York Giants are in the NFC east and this year they already play the entire NFC south division as that is the NFC division they and the rest of the NFC east are scheduled to play.  The other two divisions are the NFC west and NFC north and the Giants final two games will come one from each division.  The Giants finished in third in the NFC East in 2014 so they play the 2014 3rd place finisher in the west and the north who is the Vikings and 49ers.

Hope this helps.","1441065637"

Well, take the 21 we've got on the list, throw in Eric Bledsoe, Mike Conley, Goran Dragic, Brandon Knight, Bradley Beal, Deandre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Dwyane Wade, Draymond Green, Danny Green, George Hill, Nik Vuvecic, Tobias Harris, Nic Batum, Khris Middleton, Donatas Montieunas, Jonas Valanciunas, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gay, Isaiah Thomas, Tristan Thompson, Tyson Chandler, Ty Lawson, Derrick Favors, Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Kyle Korver, Jeff Teague, Demarre Carroll, Brook Lopez, Zach Randolph, Ricky Rubio, Andrew Wiggins, Marcin Gortat, Kenneth Faried, JJ Reddick, Jordan Clarkson, Dirk Nowitzki, Chandler Parsons, Trevor Ariza, Tyreke Evans, Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, Andre Drummond, Greg Monroe, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Tiago Splitter, Monta Ellis, Demar Derozan, Harrison Barnes, Michael Kidd Gilchrist, Wes Matthews, Andre Iguodala, Markieff Morris, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson... alright, I'd list more guys but those aren't as open and shut. 

The thing is, it's easy to come up with a huge list, because last season, Derrick Rose wasn't just not as good as he used to be, he was really bad. Literally any player who does something well and doesn't do something terrible to balance it out is better than Derrick Rose. Robin Lopez is. Anthony Morrow is. Ben Mclemore is. Boris Diaw is. Andrew Bogut is. Mozgov is. Gallo might be. Tony Allen is. Who's that guy on the Bucks? Y'know, not Giannis, not the other guy? He's better than Rose too. 

[10+ shots on 42% or worse](http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/?CF=FGA*G*10%7CFG_PCT*LE*42&amp;Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=FG_PCT&amp;dir=1), Gotcher Jamal Crawfords, your Nick Youngs, your Kemba Walkers, Dion Waiters-es, MCW's, Vander Blues... This is a bad list to be on, unless you're A) shooting a lot of threes at a good rate, or B) doing the other stuff well. 

Guess what? Rose isn't a good three point shooter, and he wasn't a good playmaker last year either. 5 assists - 3.2 TOs. He also doesn't draw FTs. 

Derrick Rose, at least the one we've seen recently, is worse than almost every starting PG in the league, because he shoots like crap and he shoots a lot. He's not a good defender anymore, and he doesn't rebound well. He DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WELL NOW. ","1441065639"

The word I'd use is ambition. I've noticed the same thing, the males I know are (for the most part) ambitious, they are usually up to something interesting. I can ask questions, and there's depth, they have something interesting to say.

The women I know watch reality TV, and go to the shopping mall every other day. They can tell me what celebrity they like, not much more.

&gt;Most of them are so damn mindless they can't even understand basic intelligent communication and just pick out a random word you said and randomly talk about any random thing they remember, just to bring the conversation back to their little realm of familiarity.

This has been my experience as well. They are very good at faking intelligence. They'll repeat the same thing in multiple ways to ""fill the gaps"" in conversation. They'll also ""fill the gaps"" by speaking at length about something that has absolutely no importance.

It almost amazes me how they use so many words to say so little.

&gt;and working for corrupt corporations is not enough to fulfill man's higher aspirations, principals of integrity and love for all.

I wouldn't assume all corporations are corrupt.

I'd argue that corporations and (mostly) capitalism are what benefits us most. If what we're saying is true, that men are ambitious, and more intelligent because of that, we are way better off in the gears of capitalism than women are.

Because we actually care about achieving, and improving. And that makes us more valuable to employers, or more likely to succeed in our own ventures.

Edit: It should go without saying, but there are of course exceptions that run contrary to what I've observed, but the general trend seems to hold true (in my experience). Women seem to be quite a bit less ambitious.","1441065639"

"Libertarians","t5_32zaf","&gt;But, if A is done using the sharpened rock, and B takes it, that is not authoritarian force. B has absolutely not infringed on A's liberty by doing this, and A can always take the rock back when B is done with it. Try to think of this purely in terms of the natural liberty of the cavemen, ignore other ideas like ""fairness"" for now. Let me know what you think.

I'll try to further explain why I think property rights are necessary, in an attempt to answer the question.  To secure one's life (which one has a right to), you need to have the right to control scarce resources in this world - be that your shelter, land to grow food on, or your wages.  You don't let the government control your property for you, because then they control your life.  When you have no expectation that you can own the scarce result of your labor, you cannot control the right to your life. When caveman A invests his time and labor into crafting the sharpened rock, he alone deserves the return on his investment (or the right to decide what to do with it).  When caveman B takes the rock while A is not using it, now caveman B is taking the ROI of A's time and labor.  In effect, B is taking control away from A.  So (while I also think this is the fairest system) to me this is not just about fairness - it is about your ultimate right to your own life.  This right is beyond merely your liberty from authoritarian force.  Since property rights (in my view) are necessary for this ultimate right, it is ""just"" to use force to defend them.  Just like in LibSoc (i'm assuming), it is ""just"" to use force to defend your life.

&gt;Well, in a sense. In our free-est possible state of being, we are limited only by the laws of nature. The laws of nature dictate that we need certain things to live - such as food. So there will always be a demand for things like food, which must be filled. This, in a sense, is functionally like the market.

Ok, that makes sense.  I think that quote made it sound a little different - that there would be only internal motivations driving people.  In reality, you're right - there would still be the laws of nature dictating certain things.","1441065642"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","well by drugs i mostly mean weed and the once in awhile mushroom trip. i used to do basically every drug all the time but i think weed and mushrooms are the ones that actually help me. plus the weed is legal here anyway. and i have a med card i was given for depression, insomnia, and anxiety. people saying not to take weed would be like telling somebody not to take xanax, ambian, or anti depressants (all 3 of which just made things worse). marijuana has been a miracle for me because it takes care of all 3 of those major, life altering issues without making me angry and full of rage like the xanax, making me suicidal like the anti depressants, or making everything hazy in my mind like ambian. 

as far as location, australia is actually my second choice too, followed by canada. i know some people in both NZ and australia, and my ex boyfriend lives in canada now. i would have my foot in the door in any of those places if i choose to, but i like living here in colorado too much to leave.

When minorities do shit we don't ridicule them for it, when white people do that same shit we don't glorify it. 

The problem isn't that white people are doing it, it's that white people are doing it *while oppressing black people for it*. A white person having dreads is only meaningful because it's a black hairstyle. White European society reinforced that everything ""black"" was bad, and that included hairstyles. Look at a mall around Halloween, *we make black people into costumes* (and I don't mean specific black people, I mean shit like [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Kjv77W-iyAc/UWhuoU_Ih6I/AAAAAAAABR0/qxjsZR50Vdk/s1600/Rasta+Dreads+with+Beanie.JPG)).

They were probably killed by a genuine drunk, not someone barely over the current absurdly low limits

Please, show me a case where someone was killed by a driver at 0.08 percent

Yes, I strongly agree that drunk driving is a problem and a crime and that nobody should drive while impaired

But, some people drive just fine after drinking a lot more than the current limit. Some have near-immunity to the effects of a reasonable quantity of alcohol

Continuing to lower the limits to levels beyond absurd will do nothing to stop drunk driving, they will only penalize safe drivers over the silly limit

The more replies to this thread that I read, the more I realize that it's probably not going to happen immediately-and I never expected that. By the time the idea even gets enough momentum to be executed, DLC for Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, and possibly even the DLC for Dark Souls 3 will be out. That's what I'm saying. And by the time we gamers have devoured those titles, then I think would be the appropriate time for remasters. But it doesn't hurt to let them know that it's what we want and that FROM and Miyazaki and even Sony have our support to pull the trigger on something like this.

Playing Jobs will only work if his attempt is beyond Oscar-worth because Jobs will be nigh impossible to represent. There's a certain element of Jobs that I think will be hard to capture.

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","Since this post has been deleted, this will probably never be read. But...hiring doesn't have to be this two-faced game, and we don't have to be this cynical.

We actually have an incredible wealth of data and technique on how to hire validly. There are mechanisms that can be built into the interview which will overtly highlight where and when a candidate has been disingenuous about their capabilities. 

The reason why we have these ""old-fashioned"" interview outlooks is because the squeakiest wheel has been getting the oil. External recruiters and hiring managers, who are not well-versed in Personnel Selection and Recruitment, are continuously pumping out bad information and just utter trash about how interview ""should be"". They prey on the desperation of job seekers who are down on their luck, and businesses who don't want to invest too much in Selection, and perpetuate the idea that hiring is just about impression management and ingratiation.

Meanwhile, there are hundreds and thousands of professionals all over the world, who use best practices established by centuries of empirical science. They bring real results to the organizations that appreciate their values, and continue to improve the science and practice of hiring. However, people don't usually hear about it because they're busy fixing/improving hiring internally, rather than lambasting job seekers on a blog.

As someone with an Industrial Psychology background, I get annoyed when I read cynical comments like OP's. It's not accurate to say this is all based on the flaws of human nature, and some things are just the way they are inherently. How it's all so terrible and we all have to just stomach this, job seekers and employers alike...We understand human nature to uncover ways for selection procedures to work around biases and knee-jerk speculations; there are better ways.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","1. This isn't necessarily true, although it is likely. Criminals tend to end up with stolen guns, which means the guns have to be purchased (or at least manufactured) in the first place. It would certainly take a long time for criminal ownership of guns to really subside, but it would likely happen. You can look to the UK to see that even the criminals don't have many guns.

2. You have to look up statistics, and it can be difficult to get good ones. Being a lazy person, I will tell you to look for yourself. You want to know: % of gun crimes using illegal guns, % of assaults and homicides involving guns, lethality of gun assaults vs other types, a breakdown of types of deaths (eg suicide, self defense, murder) with guns, likelihood of being a victim if you own a gun vs don't, crime rates in places with and without weapons. There are probably a lot more statistics you can look at.
3. It's a lot more likely that a crazy person breaks into your home with a gun if guns are easily purchased. Either way, it is incredibly unlikely overall. You may as well constantly carry a steel umbrella to protect yourself from meteorites crashing from space. Or even more reasonably wear a helmet everywhere you go. Point is, you and your family are likely at a higher risk just from purchasing a gun than any risk of a crazy person with a gun breaking in for no reason.

All that being said, it's okay to be against an increase in gun control and otherwise be politically and economically liberal. There are dozens of us, damn it! But seriously, a political party exists for people who share a majority of views, not every single one. You can still call yourself liberal and believe gun ownership is acceptable or even a good thing. Some liberal people might want guns completely outlawed (this isn't the majority). Some might want guns totally deregulated. Don't get so caught up on the label, but focus on what you think is good, right, fair, legal, and acceptable. If people didn't have different opinions even within their labels and political parties, individuals would not run for office, parties would (...which is basically what happens in large elections, but hey- we have primaries at least!)","1441065649"

Hitchcock: Torn Curtain. Not terribly suspenseful and Paul Newman as a scientist is stretching believability just a bit. Didn't care for Frenzy either.

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","fair enough. but i think the number of people in tech who are truly racist and would hire a white candidate over an indian, latino, or asian candidate purely over race (or vice versa) is exceptionally small .

the number of people looking to save money, is huge.

if you would like to read more on the subject of why many people dislike H1B's in tech, you can check out these websites.

fixing payment and worker rights for H1B/foreign workers would solve almost every problem associated with the program, as companies would not be able to save money by hiring them. They would be forced to use the program as it was originally intended, to recruit top talent from abroad (and pay top dollar for it).


[and you can really see from the employer's perspective, what they are looking to get from H1B/foreign workers here](http://hiref-1students.com/), it sounds pretty devious and extremely exploitative.  (scroll to the bottom line section)","1441065651"

Cousins isnt bad; he has outplayed RG3 the last two years by a sizeable margin.  Ownership is vested in RG3, and they want to see if he can return to 2012 form before they completely give up on him.

You're ignoring the strong showings by Bortles and Taylor.  You're also discounting their strong supporting casts.  It's also really weird that you talk about young RB's like its such a bad thing.  Especially when shoelace already had a lot of success, amd the Jaguars ranked 6th in yards/attempt last year.  Or why you're completely ignoring the talented bunch of 2nd year WR's, which are far more important to Bortles' success.

What exactly is the problem that PMD is solving? The only issue that it solves in the post is ksing. You have to be more clear on the issue you're trying to fix especially when players want things that help make the game better.

So I don't mind PMD honestly lol, but it doesn't solve much in my eyes. Nor does it cause any catasrophic damage to the game. At least new damage. The damage has been dealt before. By damage I mean anything related to the economy to pay vs free players gap, it's nothing new. Mesos are worthless, most monster drops are worthless, equipment is worthless, only some items like cubes etc are not. But one way nexon always tries to bridge the gap is pretty much give away rebalanced equipments on anniversaries. In hindsight anniveraries are alot of grind for not much fun. 

But while I'm partial to such a suggestion, I believe the point of PMD is to solve the issue of how to make nexon cash. Which is totally fine, a company has to make money. The problem is the question about support of PMD doesn't take that into context.

There are other issues supposidly about PMD, but remember damage has been dealt. You're not going to fix anything by discussing whether or not to block a ""cash grab"" or not.

The only way things can be fix is by focusing on the issues and not the solutions. Btw PMD is not a solution for ksing as people have already noted there are other maps and other private maps.

If you want to solve the issue of nexon making some cash, why hasn't nexon added premium story content. You can do that sucessfully in many ways, add a story, add  a unique item or set of items.","1441065653"

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","The following is all personal opinion - I'm not an expert in any way. :D

Just looking through most of your outfits, the biggest thing that stands out to me would be your pants, especially the ones in 45, 41, 40, 38 etc.

I know you mentioned that you weren't on board with skinny jeans, but it seems you do have some pieces that are a little slimmer around the ankle like 39 and 37, which I think fit a lot better and have a slimming effect. 

The pants in 31 are too long for you. You could probably take them back like an inch?

I like outfit 1. I do think the cropped pants work well for you but I read what you said about the ankles at work (which is a darn shame I think, because outfit 6 is nice too?)

I would get a nice fitting solid-color blazer, maybe something like [this](http://www.hm.com/us/product/95683?article=95683-B) to throw over outfit 4. I totally get you about roundneck sweaters btw.

There is something about outfit 7 that feels like it dates itself. Someone who knows more should probably comment further on this.

I'm not a fan of the grey polo shirt. It's also too big for you. The navy one looks smaller because of the color, I think, but it's probably also too big? I'd take the navy over the grey any day though. I vote retiring the grey one unless it's special.

Love outfit 14, can be brought to another level with white boat shoes.

Color contrast on outfit 15 and 35 are a little suspect. I'd go with a slightly more muted color scheme - one bright and then pick ones that don't contrast? I'd do a grey cardigan with 35, for example.

18 feels frumpy to me because of the pants. Get slimmer ones. See outfit 24. That's a nice pair of fitting pants.

Outfit 20's shirt is nice. You look comfortable in it too - maybe you want to look into getting more short-sleeved blouses like that one?

Outfit 22's tucking makes it weird for me. I think it's cos you're tucking it a little too high up? Perhaps you want to try tucking with a lower waisted pant?

I think you can pair 25's top with [khaki pants](http://www.gap.com/products/broken-in-straight-khakis-P331225.jsp?pid=331225042&amp;vid=1), actually 

I like your interview outfit, but I think could probably also look into getting slimmer pants. I'm personally not a huge fan of the skin tight skinny jeans, but stuff a little further down on [this](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/women/jeans.html) page is something I could see working for you. Also I think your blazer/jacket is a little too large.

tl;dr
My suggestions are as follows:

To Buy in order of priority: (my shitty estimate of the high end of price in parenthesis)  
* Slimmer formal pants in black (~$30)  
* Slimmer pants in khaki (~$30)  
* Slimmer pants in light grey to replace your wide ones (~$30)  
* A blazer that fits your shoulders really nicely in either black or navy. (~$50)  
* Another more casual one in light or dark grey* Optional, probably also about $50 on the high side.  
* More cute short-sleeved tops of your choice.  

Living in California, I know very little about coats. Will leave that to other people who actually know what cold is.

As for bags, we'd need more explanation of what your bag is for and what it's meant to carry. (Also not an expert on bags and will leave that to everyone else who definitely knows more than I do.)

Last caveat - I'm not particularly fashionable myself. I may have given bad suggestions so do take everything with a pinch of salt. That said, go out and rock those new pants!","1441065654"

Quoted from your website. Clearly written by someone who hasnt played Darkfall 1 or maybe you guys stated it wrong. First of all most holdings had value due to the portal system. I would say there were only a few with almost no value due to also not having good spawns around it/other possibly raiding targets etc. Next to that most had nodes that even untill the end day were worth something(ofcourse, mostly the mines). Last but not least, liability? Due to the portal network I wouldnt say any holding was a liability nor a resource drain. The once in a while bank repair wasnt much tbh ;)

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","It's the consensus opinion among breeders and handlers and owners and pretty much anyone reputable involved with the breed. This is pretty well know stuff. Most people are surprised when they see my huskies off-leash, in fact. 

As for recall training, prey drive is the key issue, since that's why your dog will take off even when you've been training for hundreds of hours. Again, very well know with the breed. Yes, they are also more independent and stubborn and that makes it worse, but it's that initial prey drive response that will cause a problem when you're off-leash in the woods. 

As for the e-collar settings, it depends on the dog. Most of the time for small critters, vibrating the collar works. In other situations, you might need to use a zap, and some dogs respond better than others. In fact, they sell a model specifically for ""stubborn"" dogs that don't mind the zap. 

For me, after spending 1500 plus hours off-leash with my oldest husky, the e-collar is a safety device. I rarely have to use it but it will prevent him from attacking an injured raccoon or going after a swan or turkey vulture or coyote or cat or whatever.

Seriously, though, if you ever talk to people who know the numbers, many of the products at a typical supermarket have packaging that costs more than the production cost of the product inside the packaging.  Think makeup, fancy mustard, many spices, and pretty much anything else that has fancy packaging (or very slick, image-heavy ad campaigns) and that costs greater than, say, $10 or $15 on a per-pound basis.


Sometimes the only difference between a brand name product and a generic one that costs $2 less is that the brand name product uses a package that costs an extra $0.20 more, and has occasional ad campaigns; what is inside is the same, from the same factory.","1441065659"

If I mount the sight in the higher set of holes(on the sight), the slider will hit the cable rod and be cocked over. It will likely not tighten all the way down to the riser and/or it could damage the sight in trying to do so. As it stands, my elevation adjustment is maxed out and I'm shooting a few inches low at 20.

At the moment it seems like I could use a spacer so I can mount the sight lower, OR, I can leave it as is and deal with it. Since you mentioned in your other comment that you have a single pin maybe you can provide some insight. Technically I could adjust the slider to do what I need and probably a mm or less adjusts to where I need it, but then the 20yd ""stop"" will not be *all* the way at the bottom of the slider, but rather just a hair above it.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Short answer is, you're not going to end up happy because you're being a superficial brat.

How it works is, whatever you think of when you imagine someone who is really attractive, is basically someone who is just out of your reach.  So, if most of the chicks attainable by you are 6s, you'll want 6.5s and 7s.  If you diet and exercise like crazy, and now suddenly 7s become attainable to you, then the only women you will be attracted by are 7.5s and 8s.

We want whatever is just out of reach.  It's a cycle that never ends, so if you play that game, you can't ever be satisfied or happy.

I went through something similar to what you're going through, and the conclusion I ended up coming to is this:

1. If you have a girl who you love on all levels, but don't find very attractive, you're not happy.

2. If you have a girl you're super attracted to, but don't click with very well on all other levels, you're even LESS happy than with number one on this list.

So, the real trick is to be realistic about what you can conceivably attain, and then try to find a happy balance of the two.

sustituye monterrey con alguna otra caracteristica y encontraras que todos de alguna forma somos racistas ya sea Poblano, jarocho, chilango, negro, indio, japones, chino, hombre, mujer, chavo, viejo.
En fin la confirmacion de algun tipo de estereotipo que por lo regular es normal ya que los estereotipos son por algo (..... a todos los negros les gusta el pollo frito..... no he encontrado a uno que no pero tampoco eh encontrado a alguien que no le guste el pollo frito!) no te hace racista.

El como actuas hacia esta persona sin conocerla primero es lo que te hace racista, en tu caso si eres racista (pasivo) por que le haces enfasis al hecho que son indios y no al hecho de que tienen malos habitos de trabajo o que tienen mala higiene. El solo preguntarte si eres racista creo que te identifica como tal .... ahora no creo que sea un crimen, si no actuas concientemente acerca de esto en otro contexto es decir si ves un indio en el camion y le empizas a decir mamadas, etc. Ya si actuas con premeditacion contra ellos te conviertes en un racista activo y aqui vas a tener pedos.

Ahora ya sabes que eres asi empieza a ver a la gente por lo que son individuos independientes de raza, color, sexo, etc. Y poco a poco te daras cuenta que solo vivimos en un mundo lleno de pendejos egocentricos que nada mas se preocupan por su propio ser ahi ya podras ser equitativo y odiar a todos parejo.

You do have slightly verbose prose that at any one point isn't technically incorrect, but the prose is always countersinking itself.

The internet is full of decontextualized sex scenes that are available for free. I found myself caring less for what was happening in the scene and more wondering without the context of the sex scene, why here, why those two people, why do they want what they want, the writing was just words.

Really gleen through your prose. Ask yourself in every sentence if you really need this word, that phrase, that descriptive word. Cut until you're left with as little words as possible for the maximum emotional connection. Especially in sex scenes, where things can rush to purple very quickly.

If you're actually putting the units *in* the plane, doing it the way you want might not work. Instead of putting them *in* the plane, spawn them in the air inside the parachute vehicle *behind* the plane as it flies over its drop area. This is how I typically see these types of drops done. They don't actually jump out of the plane, but it creates the illusion that they are, so when the units land, they retain their normal backpacks. That or simply do the above mentioned with giving them chutes, putting them in and ejecting them, then re-add their normal backpack once they are out of the chute vehicle on the ground.","1441065668"

See [this](https://critiqueofcrisistheory.wordpress.com/reply-to-a-comment-and-question-regarding-socially-necessary-labor/) article for the two different ways Marx used the term ""socially necessary labor time"" - specifically, the section titled, ""The second meaning of socially necessary labor,"" because I think that it is this second meaning that you're referring to.

However, I don't see what the specific number of laborers has to do with the second meaning socially necessary labor time, much less the first one. Of course, it should *absolutely* be noted that in the case of a capitalist who employs laborers whose labor goes wasted because the resulting commodities aren't sold, it is certainly the truth that these commodities have no value, because they have no use-value (which, as Marx notes, is realized only through exchange). But I don't see why Marxian economics needs calculations of the exact number of laborers necessary to meet demand. In fact, the reality that capitalists are operating somewhat in the dark when private commodities are produced and shipped to the market is a defining feature of capitalism.

So, yeah, you're not saying anything of consequence.","1441065668"

This would mean there are 155.956/0.10922=1427.9069 bills, rounding this to 1428 bills per stack because you can't have part of a bill.

There are ~~7~~ 9 stacks of $20, 5 stacks of $100, ~~and 2 stacks of $10 (Guessing the bottom right, and second from bottom on the left are $10. Can't really tell.)~~

This means there is: $20 x ~~7~~ 9 x 1428 + $100 x 5 x 1428 ~~+ $10 x 2 x 1428~~ = ~~$942,480.~~ $971,040.

"progressive_islam","t5_2t8su","Officially, there really isn't a Wahhabi school of thought. I think it would be very, very rare to find someone calling themselves Wahhabi. Its purely evolved into something cultural as you can't really find any examples of ""Wahhabism"" being practiced outside a certain area of Saudi Arabia. Which is why Wahhabi and Salafi become interchangeable as the ultra-conservative Wahhabi's refer to themselves as Salafi, since it is the closest school of thought that fits into their identity.

I would say the driving force behind extremism is a lack of education. A poor literacy rate plus getting their religious knowledge from men with agenda's. I also think poverty is a factor, corrupt governments creating discontent, ongoing wars with civilians as collateral damage that fuel hatred and a need for revenge, lack of sustainable food and water sources, sectarian divide, and manipulation (ex: Taliban gaining influence in the tribal area's of Pakistan by bringing in goods and supplies in return that they help the Taliban).

ISIS is something else entirely. They take Wahhabism and magnify it 100 times over. I have heard many muslims refer to them as the Khawarij, and that seems to be the most fitting as it means ""to go out"". Outside what Islam teaches.

* Narrated Yusair bin 'Amr: I asked Sahl bin Hunaif, ""Did you hear the Prophet saying anything about Al-Khawarij?"" He said, ""I heard him saying while pointing his hand towards Iraq. ""There will appear in it (i.e. Iraq) some people who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats, and they will go out from (leave) Islam as an arrow darts through the game's body.'  [Sahih Bukhari: Volume 9, Book 84, Number 68]

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt; I think that a lot of the crazier progressives can't fathom that non-middle class whites really do have to deal with racism some times.

I absolutely swear this is the case. I went to a hoity-toity liberal arts college and the vast majority of kids came from economically privileged backgrounds - upper class suburbs, expensive areas of NYC, etc. By comparison I grew up in a lower class ethnically diverse area which was predominantly black and latino. I was actually the only white kid in my 6th grade class and ended up switching schools because I was being relentlessly bullied for being white by a few black kids. The worst offender was actually a mixed race kid who I think was so ruthless about it because he felt it would garner him acceptance from the black kids - I think his bullying was a way of him signalling that he was one of them and not white like me. I was constantly called whitey, white bread, mayonnaise, honky...you name it.  I would start playing sick to not go to school and would hover around the teacher/assistant during recess to keep kids from picking on me or trying to start fights with me. When my parents complained to the principal about it, she [a white woman] said they were just playing with me and there wasn't an issue - it was just kids having fun. It absolutely sucked. And, yes, it was absolutely racist behavior. Saying that non-white people cannot be racist completely ignores my lived experience. 


This is why I want to fix class issues first and foremost - it will have a substantial impact on helping out predominantly non-white communities who are stuck in lower economic income brackets but does so without making it at the expense of white people who are also affected by the economic system. The simple fact is that economic class is the biggest hurdle for people to overcome in terms of becoming self actualized, productive, and successful members of society. If we can all realize that and try to fix it without further dividing people along race and ethnicity, we'll be able to build a much more harmonious and prosperous society. When you deny situations like mine - where it is very clear the actions of these kids were motivated by flat out racism, you just make things worse because there are in fact legitimate situations in which white people do have to deal with racism. Are they fewer and far between? Most definitely. But saying that it is not possible or that experiences like mine don't exist is naive. In a way, I'm ""lucky"" that I experienced racism as a white kid because it made me see first hand just how incredibly shitty it is. 

Because of this I take the color-blind approach to interacting with people - I judge them on their character and their actions, on what they do and not who they are. When I hear people like this MTV contributor make statements like this it makes me shake my head. I'll stand for equal rights for all, but having experienced it myself, I can never agree with these asinine assertions that racism is a one way street. My experience proves that to be false - [1] the abusive treatment of me was motivated by my skin color even though I am white and [2] the school refusing to do anything about it showed that the institution supported these kids in what they did. My experience proves that racism against whites can exist, even using her own narrow and flawed definition of what racism is. So, in this case, she can do one of two things - admit her assertions are incorrect or flat out reject my lived experience.  ","1441065674"

I like to think that i give her that shoulder and support she needs and craves and try understand how her disorders are affecting her and try relive them to my best abilities during that situation.

i would say the best thing for yourself is to say that you are making him happy, self doubt is terrible and its  best to discuss it with him then and there if you are making him happy.if you don't make him happy he would have expressed his feelings about it. honesty is the best thing i have found with my SO and it was worked wonders for our relationship.

-The John Cena open challenge was the highlight of every Raw it took place on.

-The day the New Day break up will be a terrible one

-If Kevin Owens isn't WWEHWC in the next 18 months WWE have made a huge mistake

-I enjoyed Seth more when the Authority wasn't really involved

-The new Wyatt is perfect, and I hope Dean and Roman can find a third so we can get another epic match like they had at Elimination Chamber 2014

-Having Sheamus as Mr.Money in the Bank is punishment for us booing Roman and I for one cannot wait for his 868 day reign

-The diva's revolution is a bust as long as Nikki is champ

-If they were gonna have someone break Aj's record it should have been Paige or one of the NXT women

Brock Lesner vs Undertaker was a disappoinment

Last but not least if WWE ever turn Bayley heel they'll be pissing away millions

Sorry if these have been stated before.

"RPGdesign","t5_31cnk","&gt;however what I'd really like to do is give each computer system a 'pass code' that needed to be hacked, such as 9-8-6-7-2 or something similar which remains with each computer system until rebooted or changed.

This can be handled narratively. The group knows (for whatever reason) some library of passcodes. They may be able to increase this library in their adventures (go hack a mainframe, or swipe data from an executive's terminal, or clone a security guards card, etc). Certain things may trigger reboots/changes of passcodes.    
The hacker *character* has the tools to keep track of this library of passcodes, so the hacker *player* doesn't need to do it.

&gt;I'm not a fan of ""roll to succeed hacking"" in gaming, so I'm in the middle of trying to create a more engaged hacking system for my rpg, using MasterMind mechanics.

I have played mastermind, and did like the game, but I'm not sure I have any specific advice. I guess a few more ""variables"" you can use to adjust the difficulty are if there are any clues already on the board, if there is a limit to how many pegs they can put in when they ask for a clue, and traps/viruses like ""if they input 2 red pegs next to each other when asking for a clue, they get some malware"".

However, one fun idea (separate from MasterMind) is to use the hacking mod [20XX](http://schirduans.com/david/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20XX-04-24-2015.pdf) made for the [200 Word RPG challenge](http://schirduans.com/david/2015/04/200-word-rpg-challenge.html).  
Basically, each device has an *function phrase* (a turret might have ""shoot at intruders, protect guards""). The hacker plays 3 rounds of rock paper scissors, and each win they get lets them change one word of the function phrase (so with one win they could change the turret to ""shoot at intruders, also guards"").  

You can easily make some adjustments to the 20XX rules, like: adjusting the number of words in a function phrase; how many games of RPS they play; a penalty for losing some/every game of RPS; an outcome for getting some/all draws; abilities to ""count a loss as a draw"" or ""count a draw as a win"";  high security devices having two copies of the passphrase (eg ""shoot at intruders, shoot at intruders"", which is more resilient), and so on.

Amc is the king of 1v1 boxing. Making the opponent attack the hives over you is what you want. (Which is why you put the hive behind them in 1v1 fights so then have to sacrifice even more time to kill the hive).

Your buffs would really only effect the lanning, which amc dominates anyway. Only thing amc needs is self peel. I'd say something like increasing the base slow on honey would do amc good.","1441065681"

"CarAV","t5_2t73y","This cars factory speaker set up is so bad. Those speakers will be fine. I ran Polk 4x6's and JBL 6x9's for awhile before I went crazy with my 03 Malibu. Expect about 0 low end though. I originally had a Sony HU, but now have a Pioneer DEH-80PRS. Amazing HU, but the one you have should be fine, way better than stock! Having the ability for aux, usb, and even bluetooth is awesome. I had to shave a little of the factory bezel to get the HU to fit. If you have a dremel it probably takes less then a minute to trim it back.   

What happened when I upgraded the HU and speakers was absolutely no low end. AT ALL. A 4x6 is never going to produce any midbass. and the 6x9's being is the rear deck also ensure you get no low end. Not to mention I had to cut the rear deck to get my speakers to fit. Now i'm not running rear speakers, but still. THe 4x6 being low in the door and low in RMS output, also means that the rears will almost always be over powering them. 

I had to to a shit ton of work and am running mids and tweeters in the A-pillars now and made some door pods to fit a 6.5"" woofer. 


Sorry for the rant! ","1441065681"
"zen","t5_2qhmf","1. Hmm. The truth is, there is no clear evidence of authorship for many classic Zen texts, including some of your favorites, such as The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch and all of the texts attributed to Bodhidharma, also Lin-Chi and Joshu's records. Why be so selective? 

2. Hui-Neng was a Chan monk who died and was mummified in the Zen sitting posture. He talked about his own view of what ""zuochan"" (""sitting meditation"") should be. I happen to agree with him. 

3. Huang-Po praises Bodhidharma for his wall-gazing seated meditation and at the end of the Wanling Record gives instructions for practicing it, adding: ""This alone is liberation.""

4. Joshu mentions ""*sitting* for 20 or 30 years."" In the context of a Chan monastery, this means doing the daily Zuochan meditation on a meditation bench for at least 3-4 hours each day. The Record of Joshu also contains references to Joshu's ""meditation seat"" in the Dharma-hall. (Look at it this way: if the bar down at the corner has a seat with my name on it, you can safely assume that I sometimes go there and take at least one drink.)

5. You clearly don't know what ""name-dropping"" is. Anyway, you are the one who always says that Zen is ""gossip."" I'm just citing some of it to support this case.

As for the rest, I don't teach any religion. Your little character assassination blurb is just more idiotic horseshit you made up. It's baseless insofar as you cite a Wikipedia page and a collection of Koichi Tohei's aphorisms, which proves nothing, then cite a single blog entry of mine suggesting a ""cut off thinking"" experiment people can do at home. The blog entry doesn't even mention Ki energy or Tohei or an egg timer, it just cites Huang-Po and about seven other Zen teachers on the subject of cutting off thinking and attaining internal silence.

I just to the best of my ability transmit the ancient Way of Zen. I ALSO teach some Qi strengthening practices like Shaman Tiger Qi Gong. Joshu not only taught Zen; he ALSO worked in the garden and swept the courtyard. Does this mean that he taught a mystical religion requiring a rake and a broom? Wake up.

&gt;The other continent is bigger, Eurasia size.

Also, the Wall is about 500km long. By my rough estimate, Westeros should be around 4500km (or ~2800 miles) from the Wall to the southern coast of Dorne, give or take. So about two thirds the size of South America.","1441065685"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt; This is where the thinking is so bizarre that I am wondering if I am reading you correctly. The ""many, many"" examples you refer to are the stark and utter minority in parental arrangements, among not just greater primates but humans specifically. Surely the behavior that is three orders of magnitude more common would tell us, if anything could, what evolutionary pressures resulted in?

We have [evidence](http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/17-to-1-reproductive-success) that such women hoarding was, until recently, the norm

&gt;The second thing that is so confusing is your insistence that this is a behavior with a huge adaptive value. The children of the Khan only survived with any degree of frequency because we had shifted to a largely agrarian society, a circumstance that is no more than 10,000 years old and represents a mere blip in the evolutionary trajectory of greater primates.

Actually a lot of evolution can occur in as short a span as 10k years. See: [Lactose tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence#Evolutionary_history)

&gt; Prior to that, the strategy of having as many children with as many females as possible is extremely maladaptive because greater primate infants require tremendous care to ensure survival, most especially human infants.

It was only maladaptive for low-ranking males. High ranking males can provide the resources necessary for offspring to survive. Promiscuity among men is due to opportunity and circumstance, but is almost always a latent trait. This is demonstrated by the ubiquity of polygynous cultures (and the stark lack of polyandrous ones), wherein most men only have one woman partner, but some high ranking men are able to hold a harem of varying sizes (the higher the status, the larger the harem).  Overall, of the 1,231 cultures in the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook, 84.6 percent are classified as polygynous, 15.1 percent as monogamous, and 0.3 percent as polyandrous. 

&gt;Again, you are using contemporary familial arrangements to draw conclusions about the evolutionary trajectory two million years old. I cannot stress how utterly insane this is!

I'm showing you how contemporary behavior reflects sexual behavior. Theres no reason to think the modern era has drastically shifted our sexuality from that of our recent ancestors. 

&gt;Perhaps you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. By ""evolving together"", I mean normalizing sexual dimorphism versus prior species in a gene line. Sexual dimorphism, on a genetic level, is expensive. (Developmentally speaking, you have to have all kinds of genes and stopgap processes to have one conception event diverge from the 'genetic plan'. We all start out as females in primates, for example, it would be ""cheaper"" to not have developmental intervention.) As always, environmental factors can make it overall favorable, but in our case greater primates have evolved to eliminate this cost overall and where possible.

"swift","t5_2z6zi","I'm currently involved in a lot of software contracting; right now from the supply side, but I've been the guy on the demand side too. 

You're looking at a double whammy of failure causes: $5000 really isn't a lot for native app development, and numerical optimization experience is incredibly rare even for mid-level developers. 

The general rule for freelancers (from what I've read, and speaking to folks who do or have considered doing freelance work) is that you take your non- freelance prevailing wage and double it, at least within the United States. The median salary for a software developer (inside the United States) is approximately $70k/year or around $35 an hour. So, the freelance rate should be $70 for an average acceptable US developer. 

If you've outsourced to another country with lower costs of living, a reasonable rate would be at least $35/hour. 

The folks you see flooding eLance advertising themselves at $20/hour or lower are either extreme suckers, or their experience consists of smashing together plugins in the blogging engine of your choice. Don't be fooled by the existence of these postings: that's not at all characteristic of what it really costs to develop highly custom software. 

$5000 at $35/hour will get you 3.5 man-weeks of labor. This is on the upper side of reasonable for your average app UI, but not completely out of the question. Going from idea to app for anything but the most trivial of things in less than a month is some seriously impressive velocity--but it's unlikely you'll get that velocity if you're on the lower side of the bell curve. 

Most importantly, you cannot expect familiarity with numerical optimization (the fundamental function of Excel's Solver) at these wages. The Simplex algorithm is usually an afterthought in your average undergraduate linear algebra courses, is usually crowded out by highly optimistic course schedules being hacked to pieces to fit the as much of the course in the allotted time as possible, and is almost never studied in detail outside of dedicated optimization courses. When you can't expect your average CS or EE undergraduate to be deeply familiar with the Simplex algorithm, you definitely can't expect your $35-$70/hour freelance developers to have any numerical optimization experience worth speaking about. 

On a re-read, it seems there was supposed to be a network component as well. Having a fully functional app/backend setup within 1 month for merely $5000 borders on the realm of fantasy. The complexity of a networked app is exponentially greater than that of an on-device app if any sort of per-user persistence is expected. A more realistic expectation (ignoring any optimization capabilities) here would have been to budget $30k-$40k over 3 months for a very stripped down user-oriented minimum viable product, lacking nearly all of the back-office features you'd want to start making actionable business decisions.

Sadly, I've seen this sort of thing play out multiple times over the past year, and it's always these same two things: the client not knowing the inherent difficulties of their demands, and the client not knowing what to expect for the money they've spent. Maybe you're aware of the optimization techniques Solver is equipped with, but if you aren't, you're doing yourself and your contracted employees a severe disservice by expecting any random freelancer hanging their shingle on eLance to reproduce a year's worth of undergraduate and graduate studies at the same wage as that high school ""whiz kid"" who bangs on WordPress until it sort of works right. 

If you're truly serious about this app idea, you'll have to do one of two things: either roll up your sleeves and get to it yourself (if you have the time and motivation, you should seriously consider it--pulling this off the way you want will make you instantly employable all over the U.S,), or seek out consultants with numerical optimization experience and be prepared to watch the price tag skyrocket.

Basically, cuneiform which is what Sumerian along with other languages in the ancient fertile crescent were written with, was a partially logogrpahic script and didn't do a good job of transcribing how every term was pronounced. We know how some of the numerals in Sumerian were basically pronounced, because we've found writings from the Akkadians that include some pronunciation keys for some Sumerian numerals. [Powell 1971](https://books.google.com/books/about/Sumerian_Numeration_and_Metrology.html?id=x3QqAQAAMAAJ) among other works have reconstructed what they could of the pronunciation of the numerals in Sumerian. We're pretty sure that Sumerian used base 60, as the writing system they invented included unique symbols for 1, 10, 60, and 3600, but we don't know how some of the intervening numerals were pronounced, and thus can't be 100% sure. However, there were not unique numerals for all of 1-60. Many appear to be either additive or multiplicative compounds except for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 60. For example, 5 was *i* and 4 was *limmu* and 9 was *ilimmu* (5+4). ","1441065691"

They are the laws that were outlined in Minsk that the rebels signed off on. Special statues for DPR LPR, including economic autonomy and the ability to have their own constitutions with their own elected leaders (election do need to be monitored by Ukraine) and of course official language of choice and I think military contracts with other countries. And it's a constitutional amendment so it'll be difficult to overturn. They will still be sovereign to Ukraine but will be autonomous in many ways, including the ability to collect taxes and spend those taxes without sending the money back to kiev for redistribution. Local elections nation wide is also part of decentralization which was also talked about in Minsk.

Anyhow the main points of these laws was hammered out in Minsk and agreed upon by the rebels and Putin there, so it's not like a token, it is literally what the rebels wanted in order to end the conflict. And they passed them dispute the fact that Russia still controls the boarder (not OCSE) and the rebels still refuse to let Ukraine observe their elections in October which was their end of the deal.","1441065695"

You've been together for 3 years. Were you being treated well? Were you happy? Did he hold down a job consistently? Did he give you gifts of equal value? Had he changed his behavior since finding our about the money? 

If he's really broke maybe he's just immature and excited about seeing more possibilities for fun in the future, but than in itself is kinda worrisome, because it seems he might be into spending your money little more than you are.

The film has my favourite The Who's song, [Acid Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rJGX8uqoL8) (featuring a batshit crazy Tina Turner). I have watched at least 13 times. 

**Network**: The best Sidney Lumet film, hands down. The script is excellent, the characters are perfect, and it has the most known but unknown film quote ever: [I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwMVMbmQBug)

**There Will Be Blood**: If PTA died after making this film, he would be considered to be one of the top 5 directors of the US. Daniel Day-Lewis was fucking amazing. A masterpiece. Also, [milkshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOEYT0wZFNg) (spoilers!).

**A Special Day**: a film about Mussolini's Italia but with only 2 actors, Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. My favourite Mastroianni film, probably because of his character and his story. An extremely political but subtle film. 

**Ran**: My first Kurosawa film (and maybe my first ""cult"" film). Probably not the best, but it definitely made an impact. Kurosawa's King Lear adaptation is the perfect example of a good adaptation. Taking the play's main plot to feudal Japan context and folklore. Also, the color in the film is beautiful.

But what is clear is this year the revenue is going to spike very high, they're back in Champions League which was a big deal in their revenue drop last season, they have bigger sponsorships than they ever have before with Adidas, the BPL TV deal has massively increased funds and they so far have made 8m pound more selling players than they've spent until the Martial deal goes through. Last year they were happy to spend 135m in the transfer market and only recoup 35m in the transfer market. So if I was going to estimate it, with the new money and transfer money I reckon they could probably spend £160m at least and still be okay.

(Champs league is worth a lot more than no european football, Adidas money is 80m a year or something similar, BPL TV deal has turned clubs like Stoke and West Brom into teams that sign Shaqiri's and Rondon's, you get the idea)","1441065703"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So I walk in to class in high school like any normal day. A couple minutes after sitting down the girl next to me looks over and says, ""you're going to hell for what you did!"" I'm slightly perplexed as to which of my indiscretions she has learned of and after a couple seconds of awkward eye contact, I ask what it is that she is referring to. She responded with, ""what you did to Ms. Soandso!"" Now I'm feeling a bit more relaxed because I know I didn't do anything to Ms. Soandso to warrant this type of reaction, so I politely inquired, ""what the fuck are you on about?!"" Turns out, the story going around campus was that this teacher and I got into a verbal altercation which ended with me striking her in the face causing her to drop to the ground where I then proceeded to give her a kick or two for good measure. 
Now, for a little back story on Ms. Soandso. Firstly, Soandso isn't her true surname, that has been changed for the story to protect the innocent. She was a frail, approximately 5'2"" lady in her 60's. Oh, and she was completely BLIND. 
Now, I'm not completely innocent in this story. Soandso and I had a bit of a love/hate relationship throughout highschool. She is, among other things, one of the reasons I will live out eternity in hell. I would occasionally (more like very often) pull pranks in her class and have a bit of fun with the situation. Nothing too malicious, but not the coddling normally associated with the treatment of someone with a disability. We'd get into a little bit of bickering, she'd send me to the office for punishment. But we always made up. She was a very kind woman and I feel she genuinely cared for all the students, including myself, and only wanted us to succeed. So definitely not the type of relationship that would ever result in violence. 
What really happened was that there was a small set of stairs, maybe four, just down from her classroom. She lost count of her steps, passed her class, and fell down these stairs resulting in a black eye and several bruises. One of my wonderful friends played off the well-known ""rivalry"" between Ms. Soandso and myself and started the rumor as a joke....it took quite some time before the truth got around and the demonic rot in hell looks in my direction subsided. 
 
TL;DR - They said I punched an old blind teacher in the face and kicked her while she was down.

"canucks","t5_2qrs7","Honestly, I hope we are low. Like, really low. Hear me out.

It's not a tank- almost every team has improved but us. Chia has done wonders with Edmonton so far, Murray also has done wonders with Buffalo, Treliving buffed the fuck out of a Calgary squad that can only get better (our hope here is that they don't pull a Colorado and have a bad season right after a good one). Florida is going to be doing better, as their squad of young ones are a year older now. Coyotes, Hurricanes, and the  Leafs are the teams going to be fighting it out for the bottom three and I really hope we are down there somewhere.

Because of a lot of teams getting better, we should be expected to lose a bit more games this year but the thing is, these games aren't going to be blowout games but really close ones. I'd be fine with the squad we have giving 100% every night and still losing, wouldn't you?

We desperately need a game-changing defence prospect, and honestly, Chychrun is that guy. Matthews will undoubtedly go first , Tkachuk most likely second, and Chychrun third overall. I'm not saying we have a good chance to grab him, but now that the lottery rules have changed, we really never know until the drawings (as long as we are between 4th last and 8th last we still have a slight chance to grab third).

OR-OSHA has a ""red tag"" process - we can apply a red tag to a piece of equipment or job process if there's an immanent hazard and it doesn't appear that an employer is going to act upon it. I've only hung maybe a half dozen - it's somewhat rare. But it is very effective as removal/bypassing can mean criminal charges. 

But what we don't do is close down entire companies. Only the part that is the imminent hazard. Most of the time, we don't hang a red tag - we give the employer a reasonable amount time to take care of it. ","1441065705"

While that makes sense, I feel it creates a problem when combined with the magic system. 

If I'm interpreting you right, you're saying the important component is the point at which the objective meets the subjective. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but with the magic system, it seems that means you could alter reality by changing the way your eyes see the world. And it also seems that means you couldn't use your magic through force of will, unless you could actually use your mind to alter your eyes, physically.

---

What I would propose would be a distinct difference between, well, 'seeing' and 'believing'. I would introduce the idea that one not only has to see the object, but *believe* that the object is there.

While seeing can certainly help with believing, it isn't the thing itself. Perhaps in that way, a hallucinogenic drug can aid you in performing the first step - creating the visual representation of your belief that the object is there. But the important part - bringing the object into being - must be done afterwards.

Perhaps that would allow some mages to use the drug as a sort of 'consumable buff' which makes them a more potent reality manipulator, since it removes one huge barrier toward believing in the existence of an object which isn't really there - yet. However, there could be a great cost associated with using the drug. Perhaps it makes the user very sick, or is highly addictive? Or it could just be really, really expensive.

Not to mention the side-effect of hallucinations, which would make a buffed-up mage a potentially hazardous ally.","1441065707"

It'll be nice to see him get some development, and I suppose it's nice to see that we agree that the execution is overplayed and whatnot, but I won't fault you for being excited about the art. I have *always* loved the art style, though I agree about the armors drifting in theme-quality as of recent years.

I'll give you that one on the lore. I hadn't thought about that and it is an interesting take on things. It's true we really haven't seen all of the demon hunters that ever existed (I think) and some may have come back.

"KansasCityChiefs","t5_2s3ft","Tailgating tips -

1) As you turn onto stadium drive, open your windows and take a deep breath.  There is no better smell on planet earth than there is of all the barbecuing and smoke outside Arrowhead on a game day.  Enjoy the smell of smoked meats!

2) Bring food or drinks to trade, its so easy to start up conversations with nearby tailgaters if you're bringing something with you... even better if you bring something Denver tailgaters do (I don't know of anything for Denver offhand, but was tailgating once when a Philly fan walked up with a couple small cheese steak sandwiches asking to trade for a couple burgers and brats).  If there's nothing specific you can think of, beer and soda almost always works too... ""Hey guys, those ribs look delicious, any chance I can trade some beers for a couple?"" 

3) Be friendly, you may run into jackass diehard fans, but 95% of the tailgaters or more will be incredibly welcoming.  You'll have to expect some good-natured ribbing, but as long as you can handle it (and deal it back out in a non-aggressive manner) you'll fit in just fine. 

4) Ask people about KC.  We love talking about our city and it another easy conversation starter.  

5) Play games.  If they're doing bags or washers at a nearby tailgate - ask if you and a buddy can play in for an early DENvKC pre-kickoff contest.   No rubbing wins in the other players' faces... and no sore-losering if they win.  

6) Bring chairs and coolers to sit on.   The tailgate is about the hang out.  Standing around is fine, but for hours it can get tiring to stand and/or pace around.  You're tailgating on concrete most likely and its not the most comfortable seat... prepare accordingly.  

7) Know your team.  If you're wearing a Miller jersey, know if there's something happening with him (injury, or recent award, or charitable acts).  Know whats up with your top draftees and free-agent signees (by the way... I'm still slightly bitter y'all signed Even Mathis... was hoping he'd come our way).  Not all tailgates are gonna go football talk heavy, but if you don't know shit about the game and try repping an opposing team, I'm gonna think you're a bandwagon goofball.  I'm not gonna kick you out of my tailgate, but I will judge you.  

8) If you hit a tailgate you're not a fan of, or not getting quite the experience you want, keep wandering ... there's plenty of groups out there that I am sure would be happy to welcome you.   I guarantee there'll even be tailgates of Denver peoples, stop by and say hi and let em know you came into town for the game.  

9) On the walk to the stadium, take a beer and drink on the way.  The parking lot can be a long walk... and if you're hitting a port-a-john on the way in, the lines will be long so bring a beer to quench your thirst.  

10) Walk around the main level concourse once before the game.  Its a beautiful place and theres a couple cool exhibits there about Chiefs and AFC history.  All thats left is to enjoy the game.  If anyone gets drunk and hassles you and your pals during the game, try to remember that guy is an asshole and no one likes him, even Chiefs fans. If it gets too bad, ask one of the ushers (pretty sure they wear yellow shirts) to help you out.  ","1441065709"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Sheesh, this is copypasta [from Facebook and elsewhere](https://www.facebook.com/openyoureyespeople.emoaf/posts/929862163692786)

You're list is misleading because if you bother to look up each of these verses, it is either talking about a specific group (half of them are referring to the polytheist Meccans, not non-Muslims in general), or deliberately mistranslated to make it sound more menacing than it actually is, or describing what angels will do in hell to sinners, not what Muslims on earth should do to other people. Honestly, go read /r/Islam, each of these has been debunked repeatedly. I'm tired of debunking this copypasta over and over again. 

&gt;Slay the unbelievers wherever you find them(2:191) 

Nope. Read the whole surah and [context](http://quran.com/2/190-192). It's talking about the Meccan army who was trying to invade Medina and exterminate all Muslims. That's not talking about you and even ISIS and Bin Laden never used that verse as justification for their crimes, so you're just inventing explanations by this point.

&gt;Make war on the infidels living in your neighborhood (9:123) 

Again, if you [read the context](http://quran.com/9/118-125) it's clearly talking about the Meccan war, not a command to all Muslims living and forever. Like I said, this is a bad-faith reading of Quran because had you actually read the Quran rather than just googling for the word 'fight' you wouldn't be quoting these. That is as dishonest as if I took a bible verse talking about the Children of Israel slaying the Amalekites and claiming this is a command to all Jews today to kill non-Jews.
 
&gt;When opportunity arises, kill the infidels wherever you catch them (9:5) 

[Context](http://quran.com/9/1-6) once again. Moreso, if you read *the next* ayah, it says ""And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of God. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know."" That's not at all what you're trying to argue.

&gt;Punish the unbelievers with garments of fire, hooked iron rods, boiling water; melt their skin and bellies (22:19)

Nope, if you actually bothered to actually look up what you're pasting, the [verses before and after it](http://quran.com/22/16-22) are all talking about the punishment in the afterlife. So no, Muslims are not commanded to do anything, this is describing Hell. 

&gt;Do not hanker for peace with the infidels; behead them when you catch them (47:4)

Again, [not what the verse says](http://quran.com/47/4). And if you read other verses, like [4:90](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/nora/html/4-90.html) it says that if they offer you peace you must take that peace. (There's others backing it up too)

&gt;Muslims must not take the infidels as friends (3:28)

That's **not** what [the verse says](http://quran.com/3/28), it says not to take a non-Muslim tribe as an ally over that of a Muslim tribe. The Arabic word in the text is *auliyah*, which is not the same as ""sahbe"" (friend). The Quran says elsewhere that Christians are the closest in faith to Muslims (5:82), and that marrying Christians and Jews (people from the Scripture) is allowed; how could you marry someone without being friends with them? 

I could keep going, but I actually have work to do. If you're unconvinced despite repeated debunkings, go look it up for yourself at the above link or ask /r/Islam (they are friendly people who love discussion regardless of your own faith).

If you think ISIS is going based on this, you're an idiot. ISIS members are not Quran scholars, and their videos are talking about revenge for drone strikes, not quoting verses at you and certainly not these ones. They'd laugh at you for assuming a verse about the Meccan army would be referring to yourself. ","1441065710"

Infantry rifles are designed to send a lot of lead down range. They want them to be accurate, but suppressing fire is all about sending a lot of lead. you have a harder time bringing the gun back on target.

A sniper rifle is designed to place 1 shot carefully in an accurate location and a second shot isn't supposed to be needed.

So, what do you want? A hunting rifle is going to be more like a sniper rifle where shot placement is the important factor. A semi-auto can dump a lot of lead in a hurry and can be fun at the range.

If you are going for a deer you want a careful shot, like a bolt action. If tearing up targets, a semi-auto is fun.

Sheik is the best character in the game, I won't deny that, but other characters do not have to be Sheik to be good. A lot of people write Robin off because of his speed, while ignoring the massive amount of other thing's he has going for him, such as:

* 4/5 of his Aerials Auto-cancel
* 2 of his specials (Arcfire and the Thunder variants) can tech chase even at long range, and sometimes set up a kill (Tome/Aerial) or combo
* His grabs are devastating. Combo throw and a kill setup
* High damage output.

And more. If everyone had to be like Sheik to be good, then we wouldn't have the varied playstyles and character archetypes we see throughout fighting games, and even just Smash. Marth is one of the best characters in Melee, not because he plays like Fox, but because of other reasons. Same thing for characters in other games.

My point is, rambling aside, ZeRo is too focused on what makes Sheik good, and how others don't have it, while ignoring what makes them good. Like you said, Robin can't do Sheik things, but Sheik can't do Robin things (Like Tipping the Scales).","1441065712"

A biopsy would be done to determine if it was cancer. 

So we got the first surgery appointment, and waited for another week. I kept calling the office to see if the results had come in yet...finally they gave me her vet and he said they had JUST come in, and he read them off to me on the phone. 

Perianal gland adenoma...completely benign tumor. I was so relieved! I told her she didn't have cancer and she wagged her tail at me and dropped her ball at my feet.

Is political, not religious. There is nothing about them being Christian that leads to this; a Muslim or Jewish anti-choice protester would be at the same risk. 

&gt;https://www.thefire.org/category/cases/religious-liberty/

Which of the stories on this link is ""Christian Student Groups Denied Their Rights""? One is about *any* student group “with a political or religious affiliation,"" not just Christians. All of the other stories here seem to be about Christian groups running afoul of generic rules that prohibit *requiring* members to be of a certain faith. Again, this could affect a group of any religion. 

&gt;Student suspended for ""expressing his fundamentalist Christian views""

Again, he's not being punished for being Christian, he's being punished for proselytizing and being disruptive: ""The district said it never told Leal that his activities were inappropriate because of religious content, but rather that his behavior was disruptive during school and that other students had complained. In one instance, the district said, students complained that Leal yelled “Praise the Lord!” in a class."" 

&gt;Student Suspended For Bringing Bible To School

Again, the student was preaching and teachers claim he was being disruptive. This has nothing to do with him just being a Christian.

You want to see how being Muslim and preaching the Qu'ran in school goes? Yell out ""Allahu akbar"" in class and see how well that goes for you? 

&gt;NASA specialist claims he was fired over intelligent design

The article notes there are plenty of other reasons for him to have been fired, and believing in something that isn't supported by science is a risky move in a scientific organization. You wanna try being a Flat Earther? 

Like I thought, you have no examples of people explicitly being discriminated against *for being Christian* when these things could (and do) happen to people of any faith. ","1441065718"

Yes, if you're a pro or any other level of player, you'll eventually trend towards being centered around your true skill level. However, this does not and can not mean that your instantaneous rank is equivalent to your skill level. Like OP, you may find a huge streak of games that are filled with toxic players of one sort or another, or you may find a string of games filled with excellent players and great team work. Depending on the level you're playing at and your actual skill level, a huge amount of your success in the game is going to be dependent upon your team. The only thing is that you're theoretically just as likely to get those good streaks as the bad streaks, and as a result you'll remain centered around your actual skill level.

The point is that some people are going to be lucky and be overranked, and some are destined to be unlucky and be underranked. That's how a normal distribution works. Now, it's unlikely that ELO hell exists to the degree that many people claim it does(every other MM player thinks they're in hell, obviously not true), but saying that you're somehow responsible for strings of bad luck is patently false. Moreover, you are not always able to win games just because you're better than other players. Hell, look at the Pros vs Audience games, where even a 2v5 with limitations to HELP the Pros didn't go their way. Now, imagine you're a DMG trying to get out of GNM, or MGE1. That's a much more realistic scenario, in that your skill may not be sufficient to overcome a string of bad luck, PARTICULARLY if you don't play a large number of games.

I don't get why so many pros and casters make these videos and miss the point. Obviously, 80% of the community is not being held back by ELO hell, that doesn't even make any sense. But to just say it's non-existent is a statistically false idea.","1441065721"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","In my experience, the homosexual lifestyle involves a nicely decorated home, a lovely garden, and at least a nod towards fashion sense.

""Wow, Bob, I'm jealous of your homosexual lifestyle.""

You're right on the button with your comment about choice. By calling it a lifestyle, religionists get to draw a distinction between the person and the actions.

Christian bigots have to make that distinction, or to otherwise make homosexuality a choice for several reasons. First is that if it's not a choice, it can't really be a sin. 

Second is the often quoted folk wisdom that people objecting must be repressing their own sexuality. If true, then they get to be righteous about denying their own urges. It's literally a case of 'holier than thou'. Rather than accept that part of themselves, they will deny that it exists. Instead, people are gay because they choose to be, and therefore are fully responsible for their own sin. So by refusing the temptation, they're actually being better than not being tempted at all. 

If they had to admit that homosexuality is an inborn trait based on developmental factors, then they'd be admitting that either their deity made mistakes, they're wrong about the rules, or just come out and say that they're being hateful bigots because gays are 'icky.'

    MH89 Tokyo-&gt;KUL  MH88 KUL-&gt;Tokyo

After 06-02 it's single threaded (one plane). 

Some 2014 data is available via http://waybackmachine.org/

Also consider that this ADSB data collection is automated, not manual like the ACARS message and that the flight tracks are made up of hundred or thousands of data points, so it can't just be a single communications glitch either.  

The ADSB data is married with flight records which is where arrival and scheduled times come from, so it is possible that there was a typo in the flight records, but it would have to be the same error on two different flights. Investigating the locations of the other MAS assets to identify planes that were in the proper locations to services both flights (and didn't service any other flights) might give the true tail number.

From a global security perspective, I hope that there's a duplicate number checking process running somewhere. Spoofing tail numbers in ADSB could be a way to hide a plane's movements.

The easiest way to not tunnel vision is to condition yourself to be looking at your map for most of the game.

"liquidlegends","t5_35qr9","Well, then when is the time to take a serious look at the faults in the team?  When we're winning?  We had the chance to do that all season and didn't bother.  The same weaknesses we had at the start of Spring Split are still coming up now.

The reality is that we have arguably the strongest roster in NA, the biggest support staff in NA, and had plenty of opportunities to earn our spot.  Not making Worlds can't be considered anything but an utter failure. Shrugging it off and saying ""well they worked hard, so it's fine"" isn't an attitude that team that fancies themselves among the best in their region can have.

Since we didn't go to Worlds, we have a long off-season.  Hopefully we use it to get our shit together, because we sure as hell weren't able to do it during the season.  More than anything, that probably means a new head coach, and a serious, serious look at how our shot-calling is structured.  

I think the actual roster could use some tweaking, as well.  The talent is there, but the synergy of playstyles really isn't, and we've got a couple players who have pretty severe champion pool limitations that limit the comps we can play.  There's no goddamn reason that a team with as much talent as TL should be regularly running protect the puppy comps.  Whether that's a product of our coaching staff being bad, or if it's just something that Piglet/Fenix's champion pools railroad us into, I can't say.","1441065726"

Which highlights one of the biggest problems with the ""trollcepter"", which makes cepters stand out over other highly agile, small sig ships, which is the interdiction nullify immunity it has. Allowing for a close to uncatcheable ship going to the location where you entosis something and back, wich much less chance of getting caught.

But you also might add to it that intercepters are generally great for counter entosising when you hold the grid. As it's quick, low sig radius even with mwd going, and decent ressists. Letting it orbit structure while tanking snipers.","1441065726"

&gt;If they do need it they have another job lined up before they quit.

Usually, but not always. How is this relevant to the truthfulness of the story? The employees in subject could have had other job opportunities when they quit yes... that doesn't mean the story is fake.

Even the most successful development boards, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Beaglebone, exhibit this phenomenon.  Tons of people buy them, turn them on once, find out that making it do any of the cool stuff that sold them on it has a pretty steep learning curve, and then put it back in the box forever.  

Even if you somehow captivate an audience full of experienced embedded developers, you need a community to grow up around your product for it to flourish.  This is probably the biggest reason for the success of the Arduino, Pi, and Beagle.  The huge amounts of open source software available for the platforms.

Now, genius that I am, I was working off a youtube video which essentially told me to ""wing it"" as far as temperature.  Does the carboy no longer feel warm to the touch? Pitch the yeast! I did that...and later discovered in the morning (approx 10 hours later) that the brew had been hanging out at something like 82-85 all night...ouch. It's an ale with a dry yeast, but still.  I immediately went about setting up a little swamp cooler, and got the temp hovering around the 67-71 range pretty consistently. 

My question is, did I already ruin the whole batch for the 10-ish hours it was fermenting too high? As of right now (Monday night) it's still fermenting, although the airlock activity has slowed a lot.","1441065731"

Quite a few times games have been made available for preorder for something like $60AUD, only to go up to $89AUD days or even hours later. If I know I am going to buy a certain game and play the shit out of it, I will preorder it if I can get it at an unexpectedly fair price.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","&gt; I would thank you not to assume I'm an idiot when I use specific words like ""cogent"". That was completely condescending and you are trying to devalue my intelligence when you make such a tasteless remark.

I have points I would like to address in this sentence:

1. I am not assuming you are an idiot.  I am assuming you don't know what the word 'cogent' means, because you used it wrong.  And because you used it wrong, I really have two options that I have to chose from when interpreting your mis-use (i) you knowingly used it wrong or (ii) you didn't knowingly use it wrong (i.e., you didn't know what it meant). The latter seems like the better assumption to me.  Just because you don't know the definition of word, doesn't mean you are an idiot: it means you don't know the definition of a word.  It is that simple.
2. Second, I am not devaluing anything.  If you mis-use a word, you mis-use it.  I don't understand how you have your perceived intelligence so tied up in the use (or mis-use) of a word. 

&gt;ilk can also mean ""each"" and ""every"" as well as ""type"" or ""class""

Sure, and if any of those words were substituted into the sentence that OP used, it would still be off.  The closest would be 'type' or 'class,' but then the sentence would read: 

""We need to get out the type/class from our forums and protect it.""

This is still incorrect usage, for the very same reason 'ilk' was. Namely 'the type' is incorrect.  Since it is referring to a particular person (and *their* ilk), then the sentence needs to reference back to it...  i.e., ""THIS type.""

There are other problems as well, with the choice of 'ilk,' but this is the one that I am most likely going to be able to explain to you.","1441065735"

But I could totally see some kind of capture mission of ex Xcom person made into Advent lackey and taking out the chip. Or someone like Tygan contacting Xcom to help them defect. Which could make a cool this might be a trap or this might be real decision. Then you could use intel to find out or give you a this is % real defect mission.

Okay, so yea subbing can be abused and what not, but it's not really giving the team an advantage, technically. Also, even if you feel as though it might, you can limit the subbing to 1-2 times per season, so every team will likely stick to actually saving their substitutions for an actual DC. 

If they actually try to take ""advantage"" of the subbing, then they just took a huge risk in doing so by using up one of their substitutions (might be the only one, depending on how many is given) and the team might have needed it for a legitimate DC later on in the season. I don't think any team will want to risk that **especially** after seeing the multiple DC games that have happened so far.

There are some basic rules to the guild
-say hi to everyone when you log in and bye to everyone when you log out

-no rape jokes. the guild welcomes everyone from every ethnicity and all walks of life. No discrimination will be tolerated.
-everyone is allowed to play which ever build they want.
-just be friendly and try to partake in guild events as much as you can.

Reap can fill you in on other details. You will most likely be given a trial membership to see how you fit into the guild for a week and then go from there :)","1441065739"

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt; Pointing out logical fallacies is useless. It doesn't mean you won the argument. Arguments are won on emotion not logic. It shouldn't be this way but it is.

Let me reiterate: I'm not interested in winning an argument. I'm interested in having a discussion. The purpose of pointing out the fallacy was not to ""win"" but to say that point and only that point was invalid. I've made similar errors before myself, and I appreciate it when people can bring it to my attention.

&gt; The people who condemn woman as whores are the problem.

I'm glad we can agree on that. I understand why they do, and I hope they can eventually learn how destructive that line of thinking is.

It honestly sounds like we have very similar positions. The only real point of contention seems to be that you feel that it's no big deal for us to keep the pictures for our own benefit, while I feel it's disrespectful to disregard her wishes.

1. You just have to use your Defensive CDs properly (Epiphany and Pot). The rest should come from Globes and LPS on your items. (Check Quins Build for Stat weights).

2. Because you dont keep attention on your Broken Promises Buff. If you just hit SSS whenever its up you are not dealing optimal damage. Of yourse in some packs its better to use it asap because of the invulnerability it provides. Try disabling the White Damage Numbers in the Options and use SSS when you see the Crits rolling like Crazy from the Generator.

The gear looks good so far, but you really need the Fist of Az to break the 50s of GR imo.

A lot of assumptions are made around the filesystem functioning as a tree. Current filesystems are very fast at looking up files because of all the research that goes into making trees fast. Most accesses are the equivalent of pointer lookups.

Now add not only an abstraction layer on top of it, but a database that maps those lookups to rows in a table. Factor in that the database is going to have to be file backed (unless you want to explode the memory requirements of your OS) you're talking about a ton of drawbacks, for not a lot of gain.

Much better would be to leave the filesystem the way it is, and build a relational *view* on top of it.","1441065741"

The main problem I can think of, haven't had the time to test this out, is that when I stream I'm never actually in game when I stream.

After that I'm out of the game so I can easily access the goal horns and any other stream thing I might need to access.  The only way I think this would be useful is if you can set hotkeys that work when the game is not the active window (does that make sense?)

"justneckbeardthings","t5_2xp02","Yeah, two. They were both Niceguys as well as neckbeards, and I was fresh out of a long-term relationship and they just happened to be there. 

The first guy wasn't so much a Niceguy while we were dating; I found out after we broke up that he started calling me pretty terrible stuff to anyone that would listen, though, so I guess that kind of makes him a Niceguy? He was a typical scruffy-bearded trenchcoat-wearing basement dweller, and the only thing that stopped him from looking like a super-typical neckbeard was the lack of a fedora and decent hygiene. While he wasn't a terrible boyfriend, he started really getting on my nerves after a while.

The second guy was more of a Niceguy than a neckbeard, but he still had prominent neckbeard traits. He was *really* proud of his intellect, and would sometimes make things up to sound really knowledgeable or fake knowing about stuff he'd never heard of. He lied *a lot*, was pretty condescending and very manipulative sometimes. I broke up with him when he started getting super clingy right after I came back from a trip overseas, and for months afterwards he kept trying to guilt-trip me into taking him back; on one occasion he talked about killing himself and wondering (aloud) if I would care. We cut off contact shortly after (which has been WONDERFUL), and I've heard that since then he's become a major dickbag. There were a lot of really gross things he did that bothered me, such as:

- Complained to me on at least two occasions about how one of his female friends had 'fucked all their friends' except for him, and he was angry that he 'didn't get a turn'.

- Would comment about the appearances of women that were around when we were in public, but mostly only parts of them- one of his favourite things to point out was (and I quote) ""dick sucking lips"". 

- Called himself a feminist on *many* occasions, but once admitted that he only got into feminism because he wanted to get laid.

* Is capable of driving across the country (Going to want to visit my friends at colleges that are out of state)

* Can sit 4 people (It can just barely sit 4 people, I'm not going to be driving around many older folks who need the space)

* Gets at least okay MPG (Greater than 17 City and 19 Highway) 

* Something that is a little more fun than a 96-99 Civic

* Is somewhat reliable or cheap to fix so I don't spend more money on it then I buy it for

* If possible a hatchback (Maybe even a hot hatch :-P) would be super nice but I'm perfectly fine with something else

* Here's the hard part. I'm willing to spend up to 5k, but that's really pushing it.

It was a brown dresser, painted it aqua, pulls are navy, and the top drawers were turned into shelves with coral fabric mod podge on them! Now it's my pretty TV stand =)

The article goes on to state that mass production would begin in May or June.  It could very well be BS, but I wouldn't consider the supposed production schedule to be much of an indicator of it.

I'm more interested in the claim that they'll manufacture and ship 20,000,000 units before the end of 2016.  If NX flops as hard as Wii U they'd have to give the rest away as Happy Meal toys.  Even PS4 didn't sell through 20,000,000 in a single year, let alone part of one.

It depends on what you mean by ""keep trying"" - if you mean continuing to send her social questions in that general time period... I wouldn't recommend it.  That gets annoying really fast.  Especially if you're asking questions rather than just making comments, her lack of response indicates she's either busy or not interested in talking then.  Either way, repeated attempts are not a good idea.

If you just mean in general sending her things every so-often (i.e. once or twice a day), sure.

&gt;as an INTJ, if you liked someone but they stopped texting you, you would never text them back to initiate?

I'd contact them in some way eventually, if we weren't interacting at all in any fashion.  (Again, I hate texting.  I'd more likely send an IM or email.)

Now for the advice.  You get nothing for being honest.  You may get self satisfaction, you may get a pass on this one, but you get nothing, it does not automatically reward you.

There are four of you that could have done it.  Only one did; you.  If you do not admit guilt then neither will the others, as the did not do it.  They can punish all four of you, but that could be challenged.  They could assume all four of you were in on it, which is where they probably will go.  This means you will be the cause of harm to three others.

They could (I would) go that route to flush you out.  If you hang tight you would receive a punishment anyway as they assume you all did it, plus you would be a dick allowing them to be punished for what you did.

If they don't go after all of you, no collusion, then not admitting guilt will be your best outcome.

Don't cheat.  Not only can you get caught, but it makes it easier to cheat the next time.  Think about that the next time you go under the knife for an operation.","1441065751"

How has Homura ""learned"" from her past experience to incorporate that into her new selfish desires?

In the original series, Homura was selfish, at least in the beginning. She kept trying to save Madoka out of her own desires for friendship. *She kept failing*. Then at the end, during the lesbian space hug, Homura finally was able to let Madoka go. You can see her change in attitude from the scene that she has with Madoka's mother in the aftermath.

Then because of one line from Madoka, [which, by the way, isn't even true](https://i.imgur.com/E7nMPk5.jpg), she goes back to her original mindset?

Call me skeptical, but it just seems to me that Homura had doubts about the whole thing and just wanted an excuse to go back to her original mindset.

This is where Rebellion fails for me as a narrative since they've essentially rejected the entire point to the original series, Homura learning from her mistakes and the [inherent selfless nature of magical girls](https://i.imgur.com/78oN0Bk.jpg).","1441065751"

Tier 3: Not good enough to buy, but if you get them for free then you may as well hold on to them, unless you desperately need scrap (reverse ion field, fire suppresion, distraction buoys, shield charge booster)

I am also pro-netflix, anti-cable. It has been lumped in to the ""other"" category with phone, internet, and other small expenses.

And yes, Toronto is somewhat expensive for rent. From what I have seen apartment hunting so far $1200 will get you a reasonable apartment and $1500 a really good apartment. I am currently aiming for about $1350 per month to get a good balance.","1441065753"

So now you're making an antagonistic post in order to find someone who'll fight you to confirm your initial idea that Bernie supporters are anti-Hillary. Not only is that confirmation bias, you're actively searching for it. 

You've already been shown the statistics that the vast majority of Bernie supporters are not voting for Bernie because they're anti Hillary. Yet you seem to pretty much ignore that and insist that your personal anecdotes are more relevant. And now you're looking for more anecdotal evidence. Great. Have fun with that. ","1441065753"

"Ingress","t5_2vij9","I'm either doing a bad job explaining... or you're not following what I'm trying to say. 

I don't have a problem with people who have ""different styles of play"". I really don't. Agents who are going after their Trekker badge -- aren't effecting me. Agents who are going after their Guardian badge -- doesn't effect me. Agents throwing field for big MU -- doesn't effect me,etc..etc.. 

What I have a problem with.. is Agents who choose a specific ""style of play"" INTENTIONALLY to ruin the game-experience for everyone else (from both teams). 

Carpet-bombing does that. If a radius of 10 or 20 blocks around me has been carpet-bombed down to just being L1 or L2 portals,.. it means:

* I can't Link/Field to any of them.. because they aren't fully deployed. 

* It's not worth my time to go out Hacking them.. because it's only gonna give me L1 gear.. which I don't have any use for. 

* It's also not worth my time to try building the area up... because by the time I get 3 or 4 blocks into it.. someone else comes along and carpet-bombs it again. 

So... it ruins my game experience.

It's like if you were a race-car driver.. and your car was in the middle of the pack,.. and then the START horn blew.. all the cars around you just crept forward at 2mph. And you're trapped there with no options and no way out.. and nothing to do. You're going to tell me SERIOUSLY that you'd be happy with that.. and your response would be:.. ""Well.. that's just their style of driving."" .... ?

Her size (she among the smallest females in the group) would seem to preclude her from leadership, as there are much stronger people in the group, and people who are trained to fight. But there is something about her ability to make hard decisions and stick to them that compels the others to follow her. 

In fact, I describe ALIVE as ""post-gender."" In the story, no one gives a rat's ass how someone identifies, as long as they can get the job done. Gender is irrelevant: competency is all-powerful. ","1441065756"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","the question i posed is perfectly valid lmao. if you can provide to me **current** sources to **definitively prove, without conjecture or using past data (which is irrelevant to this current season, because all players and teams are _completely different**) that KR/CN &gt; NA/EU (which i'd agree with *anyway*) and provide the data to back it up, then i'd say riot could use a different seeding format. otherwise it's unfair and *pointless* for everyone to use the system you propose.

your system (and i just ran a simulation bracket) **completely** misses the point of worlds. worlds is *supposed* to be region vs region to determine, of all regions, which team is the best. in the current system, you are forcing different regions to face other regions in matches; the strongest region will win *regardless* of the system, but riot's worlds format allows for more diversity.

your system ends up with a lot of (if not mostly, depending on pool) in-region matches, which is a **huge waste of time**. the whole point of the individualized region games (LCS NA, LCS EU, LCK, LMS, etc) is to determine which teams in their respective regions are the best among them. we already did that; we don't need to do it again and waste time in group stages.

you can't just keep asking ""prove to me that this system is better than mine"" if you have yet to prove that your system makes any sense. this argument is almost as pointless as your proposed format **lmao**","1441065758"

Or, just maybe the dog that bit her was a strange dog that couldn't be found afterward which led to her getting a series of very painful rabies shots. That can be a lasting and traumatic memory.

Some people also say 'bitten' when they actually mean mauled. I had a high school classmate that had some pretty serious looking physical scars on his leg. It turned out that when he was small a dog belonging to a relative thought he was a chew toy. Fortunately he didn't have to get rabies shots, but that dude did not like dogs at all.

It did not, it showed the opposite. The revenue was 1/4th of the production cost, that is why they stopped supporting the game, they couldn't keep on with the huge revenue loss.

&gt;and there's still recognizable elements in it that are largely popular still today.

Today complicated games are not wanted, they need to be simple to pick up. Tribes with generator play is not simple, and is very very tedious, thus will not be really be taken well by the current gamers.

&gt;I'd say the audience is definitively out there, but the more burning question is can Midair find its way to them, without the name recognition of Tribes, or marketing budget of a big-scale commercial release?

It's not really out there, the player base for Midair will be very small, very very small. I've assumed midair wasn't really intended to generate much profit (if any), otherwise it'd be a bad move to make a new tribes game.","1441065759"

I have been finding it exceedingly difficult to recommend any nVidia card to any user lately unless it's a 980Ti.

- The 980 is too expensive
- The 970 is a 224-bit mem bus card marketed as a 256-bit mem bus card, and the vRAM issue still affects people DEPENDING ON THEIR USAGE SCENARIOS AND SETUP (important) and nVidia, who has the ability to fix it by telling their drivers to ignore the last 512MB of that card, refuses to do so, because then they can't say it's a 4GB card anymore.
- The 960 is pathetic for being a 960. It replaces the 760, but its 128-bit mem bus is disgusting; even with the faster GDDR5 memory clock over the 760 AND maxwell's ~15% boost to memory bandwidth, it still falls short of even a GTX 660. Hell, even short of a GTX 285 from how many years ago.

And then on the other hand:

- AMD cards can't tessellate for shit
- Can't OC for shit
- Have DX11 driver overhead like crazy.

A lot of people for the above valid reasons might wanna stay away from AMD, but honestly I'm starting to think it's better to go with them than to deal with nVidia's broken-as-hell lineup.","1441065760"

If you're looking at suburbs like Miami Gardens is to Brickell/Miami Beach, then rent should be reasonable. I'm not familiar with all of the other neighborhoods enough to point out where to live. 


Here's an example. https://www.zumper.com/blog/2015/07/seattles-cheapest-and-most-expensive-neighborhoods-to-rent-this-summer/ 

It's not a perfect map, but those are realistic depending on what you are looking for. I pay close to $2000 a month for less than 500 sq ft. However I'm right in the center of the city. Portland is a great option if you want a walkable city that is cheaper than Seattle. They even don't have sales tax, but there is state income tax. Some people end up living in Vancouver WA to get the state tax benefit and buy stuff in Portland since it's not far away. 

My friend pays less than me in downtown Miami and has a bigger place with similar amenities. That's where I'm coming from.

Never. Never needed to in the past.

Haha, alright alright. Incorrect wording. You know what I meant. 'Kills' I meant 'wins the battle over', 'tips in favour of'. Either way, I've never seen an infection in my beers or ciders before so I'm in unchartered territory. 

*It doesn't look that bad to me either. It's probably lactobacillus or Brett, both of which are mild enough to be considered desirable in some circumstances. You should keep your carboy better topped up, especially in secondary. That will help stop this kind of thing from happening.*

I ran out of apples.

*I would rack and sulfite it. I don't think there is any need to add yeast..you already added it right so it should be fermenting just fine (do you see bubbles?).*

It had a vigorous primary ferm. Left for about 2 weeks in primary. Then, racked to secondary because i noticed some small white spots on blow off tube and surface. It didn't do anything when I added honey to the secondary (not much anyway). I'm guessing the bubbles on the surface is caused by gas trying to escape through the 'film' on the surface.

I was carrying around 20lbs in that little bag during that trip, walking miles at a time, but it was still fairly comfortable. I usually complain about straps digging into my shoulders, but the pads really helped.

After watching episode one, I'm sure I will end liking this show more then the first time.   
It was a fun ride, and it will be a fun ride again.  

I'm impressed by the subtil foreshadowing in this episode. Even knowing what will come, you can easily miss it. You could say its not as heavy(.. or not as much...) as in madoka. But yuuki yuuna ha yuusha de aru is definitely not madoka. I'm sure I will compare them in later posts.

But two questions:  
Is it worth to search for the bluray version?  
And are there any recomended subs, that do a noticeable better job than the crunchyroll subs? (maybe like explaining the untranslated words, like shinju and so on.)","1441065772"

As for passives stopping when the bearer dies, I think that's most of them? Likely wrong on this, take with pinch of salt.

Update: Seems Isaiah would need to be in the main party if his Passive is to work (at least going by findings on Nimpha's version), so it might be a good idea to LB him if only to make sure he doesn't perish as easily.","1441065772"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Write your friends a letter or message on Skype so that they can read it and take it in without you having to answer and defend yourself right away. 

It should say something to the effect of,  

""Look, I love you guys like brothers, and I know you only want the best for me, so I'd really like to clear something up. I love Janet, we're compatible in every way you can think of, including sexually. We can talk for hours, she makes me laugh, we have similar values, our long-term things (kids, lifestyle, etc) line up, and the sex is the best sex I've ever had [Your own words, OP]. 

In short, I want to marry Janet because I think she will make a great life partner. I am not settling in any way. In fact, I love the way she looks. I know she is heavy and I know that most guys don't go for that, but I think she is really hot.  

That being said, since you guys are like my brothers, if there is something else about Janet that you would consider a dealbreaker--something you've noticed about her that maybe I've missed, like she treats me poorly, hates babies and dogs, is a closet racist, shows symptoms of a severe mental illness, is secretly trying to recruit us all into a doomsday religious cult, confessed to getting a thrill out of committing wire fraud, then by all means, please advise me. 

But if your one and only objection to Janet is being heavy, relax, please, for all of our sakes. Without boring you with the details, I am completely happy with her body and wouldn't wish her to be any other way, and the last thing I want is to have to feel awkward and strained around the best friends a guy could ask for just because of having a heavy wife."" 

Also...please make sure to tell your beautiful wife early and often how beautiful she is and how sexy you find her! The message will sink in. 

EDIT: I thought about it some more, and realized what your real issue is. I get the impression that you might not be fully respected as an equal in this group. If you set them straight, first in the car and then with some other communication, and they *still* don't get it, that means that they do not respect you as much as you thought. Sadly, it might be that they do not respect you enough to trust that you know what choice is right for you. 

If that is the case, and I sure hope not, I hope they come around, then you tell Janet that you have come to realize that they don't respect you as an equal. ","1441065772"

They are using pointer wrapping/allowing negative pointers -- they don't actually wrap all the way around, just allow access to empty slots if you go back before 0.  Think you might want to mention that, given the specs do not define what you should do in these cases, and just give a few examples of different non-standard behavior.  I guess that is a lesson in writing good exceptions rather than simply gliding over possible errors.

Second, you need to print each result on a newline, which in fairness their example did, but after figuring out the pointer issue I had to spend another 20 minutes figuring why my output still did not match.  It's always the stupid things I guess.","1441065772"

People who were in the  Confederate army,  people in power, and ordinary people all had a part in creating the klan, and that included people in the north who wanted to keep society segregated.  The kkk (its members obviously included politicians) had to be discreet in their operations because of existing laws, and jurisdictions, but largely they help make segregation possible until the social turmoil of the 1960s

There kkk still exists, but pretty weak.

Roche has tWind Slash, Hikari has tFLABSTAB, Maria has tEoG, Drake has tLower the Anchor

If the team doesn't have multihitters or has a Roland, I normally use this team. Basically stunlock all around since both Kriem and Alex have tRH while Mew as tEoG and Wilhelm has Overdrive. Kriem also has her 6* SBW.

10% damage is 10% damage. 7% IAS is again 7% more damage, disc is 13% damage, a lot of these are worth more to have than to have area damage.

Disc is secondary yes, but you are only allowed one reroll stat, so if you have no disc, you have to roll disc. Rest of the stats are wholly taken up by stats that give more damage than area hit. Not to mention Area hit stat is completely useless on bosses.","1441065776"

Remember, Ns are a lot like small children, in that they have limited self control and tend to make very extreme statements.  (Of course, actual small children have empathy, unlike Ns.)


My point is that her vicious behavior is not something that you need to take to heart, anymore than you would be heartbroken if one of your own children threw a tantrum. 


And if anyone ever questions why you chose to cut your mother out of your life, this is a perfect example of why you did. What she said is vile and ugly and cruel.

It's been a minute since I posted in this sub but my disdain for ""start ups"" aka ""SCAMS"" is extremely high.

I've had multiple organizations, retards with no brain, etc try to recruit me to post ""analysis"" or ""predictions"" for their website, group, page, twitter, ETC...

They all have one thing in common

**You (they) do not give a fuck about the actual analysis or predictions.  Facts do not matter, posting bullshit analysis to sway odds doesn't matter, and eventually all you fucks want to charge a fee for ""premium memberships"".**

If your site wasn't offline I could be 100% on you but nevertheless it's offline and I can only read your facebook page since it was created **not-to-long-ago**.

*  **Lets get Real, people**

1.  Anyone with the ability to post analysis that leads to profit overtime is KILLING themselves.  When me (anyone) is moving point spreads, lines, etc by 5%+ they've lost they're fucking mind to post publicly unless there is an incentive (i.e. predict the wrong team and bet huge which still has risks without insider knowledge).  
1.  If said person had this ability why not start their own page?  What do you offer them?
1.  No one gives a fuck about an idea that's been played out  5 billion times the past year.
1.  Go higher a dev and make a jackpot site.  I think they're 2,000$ for the code at the moment.  Scam those fools.
1.  Fuck you
1.  If you're ""site"" comes online and I see it's something completely different than what I see on your other social media I will apologize with grace.  However, we both know that's not the case.

"Xcom","t5_2si6x","You should be fine, large UFO's are not really all that difficult, the only hard parts are avoiding pulling multiple pods at the start which can overwhelm lower aim/lower perk troops, and the outsider pod. 

I like to take a heavy shotgun force, since your aim on your guys sucks anyway, and shotguns early on have high kill potential, even against drones and seekers. 

My personal strategy is to take assault with plating/flashbang, and a scout with motion tracker/flashbang with shotguns. They work as a high damage/high kill reaction force. infantry &amp; rocketeer with rifles, rocketeer goes full load on rockets. Medic will full loadout on medkits and a shotgun, sniper  and a LMG gunner.

i find engineers to be rather weak on large landed ufo's due to the lack of destructable cover. they could be good with AP grenades to kill pods fast. 

Depending on spawn, you either camp the spawn location in full cover until you kill a few patrols, or if your on the side go vertical and go up. I actually prefer the side spawn as you can go up, and easily trigger single pods that either rush you in the case of floaters/seekers, or tend to come in one at a time, so almost always die to mass OW fire. 

The only real drawback is you really need to hold on to at least one rocket, preferably two for the outsider pod if its 6 aliens. with 4 its pretty easy to brute force your way into multiple kills with shotguns. 

In april, you would face thin men, floaters, drones, seekers,  mutons lids and outsiders. if you get lucky and they do not invest resources, you can get a heavy drone/seeker grouping which makes them easy to clear.

1) If you do talk to another manager internally about a potential opportunity, who do you think the FIRST person they are going to ask about you is?
2) How different will my response be if I know about the conversation vs. if I don't. I will be in a much better frame of mind to respond positively if I know that question is coming.

Ultimately, regardless of etiquette or being the right thing to do, it does make sense when looking at possible internal options to at least let your current manager know about the conversations.","1441065782"

This isn't the first time AMD/ATI has had a leg up in the race. It wont be the last.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Just was told my post was inappropriate because I had not specified I was a parent... which I don't particularly get... making a rule that only parents get to contribute here means that people who aren't parents but do have valid ideas questions or points are excluded. My post was relevant because of an experience I had on the other end of the parenting spectrum... as a child. Telling it from the parents perspective wasn't my reality.

The intention might be to stop people from being deliberately provocative raging assholes, but you don't need a ""parents only!"" rule for that, just a ""don't be an obvious douche"" rule. Of course I'm not the one putting in the time as a Mod so not my business in the end. But when you read a post like mine, which is clearly and specifically about and only about parenting  without being rude, provocative or inciteful but that does not specifically clarify that I am in fact NOW a parent when it adds absolutely nothing to the narrative or its validity it's a little bizarre to take the time out of your day to enforce the rule.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","My favorite co-ops are **Darkest Night** and **Pandemic: The Cure**. 

DN is kind of similar to Arkham Horror but much more streamlined and IMO better, though that's a contentious position. It plays in around an hour, can handle 4 comfortably and 5 at a stretch (6 if you want to play the adversarial mode *and* the 5 player variant), and it's a great thematic adventure, perfect if your friends like to supply a bit of the story themselves. Also great solo. I recommend at least the first or fourth expansion to extend the shelf life -- they introduce mechanisms which stop you from camping to buff up your heroes.

P:TC is the dice version of Pandemic. Seeing as you already have Pandemic, it might be too similar for you, but if you like the theme and you like rolling dice, check it out. I actually prefer it to the original, not least because of the shorter setup and play time. **Forbidden Desert** is also a great option if you want a different Matt Leacock game.

Finally, **Sylvion** is really good, but it's primarily a solo game, and can only handle 2 at most. And if you do play with a partner, be warned that it gets quite a bit tougher.","1441065784"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; In fact he has a history in his home state of stealing Republican votes because he fights for small, main street friendly values and he has some actual common sense about issues like guns and intrusive government.

I feel like I always have to start these posts with ""I really like Bernie Sanders and will be voting for him in my state's primary"". But there it is.


Your argument assumes that Vermont Republicans are the same as Florida or Ohio Republicans. Winning over Republican voters in New England is an entirely different ballgame to winning over red-state voters elsewhere.

And while I agree with Sanders on a lot of things, he did vote for the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, which would have been more strict than the previous ban and would have banned rifles or pistols whose magazine can accept more than 10 rounds. He's been further right than most of the DNC for years, but he's softened that considerably more recently.

That may not hurt with Democrats, but the GOP will not hesitate to label Sanders a ""gun-grabber"", earned or not, which will have an effect on Republican and swing voters.

&gt;He already polls ahead of Trump in head to heads.

I mean, I'm encouraged by Sanders' rise in the polls but 1) Trump, while the front-runner is still likely not going to be the nominee and 2) those are polls conducted before the GOP has really started hammering Sanders. They're focusing all their attention on weakening Clinton right now; if Sanders wins the nomination, they'll start attacking him in full force, so current poll numbers may not hold.

As another poster mentioned, they're going to hammer the word ""socialist"" into the ground. Yes, it'll be in a way that more or less lies about Sanders democratic socialist views, but if you're banking on a political party to not distort its opponents' views and fear-monger, then I have a bridge to sell you.

I'm not saying it's impossible to overcome; I'm just saying it's an uphill battle and pretending it won't be is unwise.

&gt;And... I'm still waiting for anything else.

The GOP is currently operating under the assumption that Clinton will be the nominee, so they're happy to lay off of Sanders if it means weakening Clinton. Presuming that they'll just continue to lay off if he's the nominee is naive. They will *make stuff up* if necessary. That's what happens in high-level political campaigns. Look at 1972, when then-front-runner Edmund Muskie's candidacy was in part ended by his response to [allegations that he hated French-Canadians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canuck_letter) which were later revealed to have been fabricated by the Nixon campaign.

&gt;4 of them have signed a pledge to repeal gay marriage,

Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal. None of them will be on the ticket. And, of course, even if they were *and* they got elected, they can't just do that. It'd need to be a constitutional amendment, which will never happen.  In fact, that's what the pledge was; that they'd support an amendment (which will never happen). They're taking a far-right stance on a social position that they'll never have to follow through on in order to try to gain support from social conservatives.

&gt;I just can't picture a scenario where they can win.

The electoral map is favorable to Democrats, but it's not *that* favorable. 

&gt; They are appealing to a base that account for such a small portion of the country.

Currently, yes. And whoever the nominee is will try to pivot to the center after the primary. I'm optimistic it won't work, but it's silly to just assume the Democratic nominee will coast to victory.

&gt;The only way they WIN in the general is if the Democratic party is too downtrodden to turn up (like in 2014).

I'm skeptical that the reason Democrats didn't show up in 2014 is that they were ""too downtrodden""; they didn't show up in 2010 either and in both instances, things were going relatively well. It seems more likely to me that young voters, who form a crucial bloc for the Democrats, weren't motivated mostly because non-Presidential elections are perceived of as ""uninteresting"". Every single day, there are posts that talk about the futility of being a voter in a non-swing state, completely ignoring the fact that the laws that most affect voters day to day are state level laws.

"coys","t5_2ryq7","David Bentley, our record signing until Soldado (and later Lamela). £15-17m in 2008, which is (very roughly) 23-25m 2015 Euros. He also had no resale value (unlike Lamela or Soldado) 
Moreover, our revenues were significantly lower in 2008, I'd wager that Bentley cost a higher percentage or revenues than Lamela did (effectively the club's purchasing power).

Bentley's league performance over three seasons:
42app, 3g, 4a.

Lamela last season in the league:
33ap, 2g, 7a

That's already a better return than Bentley provided in three seasons. Of course if we do sell Lamela, he'll bring back 15m+, reducing the total outlay (a poor way to calculate transfers) to less than we spent on Bentley.  

And while you believe Lamela is a terrible player with little to no potential to improve, I still believe he can be nearly world-class. Perhaps not with Spurs, but (hopefully) like Soldado, I expect Lamela to flourish if we move him on. I want to give him another season to see if he can become that player with us.","1441065787"

Samsung does a lot of... oddities to their build of Android which causes a good amount of instability, which are not seen in stock or other custom Android builds. A good example relates to IPv6. As a ""battery saving"" measure, Samsung has issues with the driver they use for their Wi-Fi hardware, where once the phone is put to sleep, it will not answer to RAs for IPv6, or route any IPv6 traffic. This means, the phone will not maintain or obtain a new IPv6 address if it was previously using one (cellular data is an exception here!). This breaks push support and causes a number of other horrible things on the phone. This is devastating on IPv6-only networks, which makes pen testing applications terrible to do on Samsung devices. This also means a phone connected to Wi-Fi with Android Lollipop will have no data service at all on an IPv6 network (there was a bug prior to Lollipop where in order to use IPv6, you needed to use IPv4. This is another story for another day, though). In some cases, I have seen this cause issues with IPv6 enabled 802.1x Wi-Fi networks, which require the phone to be totally rebooted because it fails to pull an IP or just straight-up doesn't detect Wi-Fi networks because the network stack went to lunch.

However, the number of bytes has changed since the beginning of the loop, because you replaced a part of the string and changed its length, but you are telling it to replace the number of bytes corresponding to the old string.

For example, if you had the string ""Today is &lt;day&gt;"", that is 14 bytes. Then you replace ""&lt;day&gt;"" with ""Monday"", the resulting string ""Today is Monday"" is now 15 bytes. If you print 14 bytes explicitly, you cut off the last letter.

Also, since you are in a while loop, your buffer is no longer as big as it was on the first pass. The `getBytes()` method returns a new byte array, so your old 1024 byte buffer array is gone and it is now the size of your current string, meaning if the next string is longer, it won't fit.","1441065787"

Arruda - 1-5m long (teeth to tail) semi bipedal, four-limbed, hairless creatures. They have a circular mouth that could expand to nearly5x it's apparent maximum diameter. Possessed of a cunning animal intelligence, they would make a terrifying keening noise to flush prey towards larger arruda, who would then kill them by either trapping some portion of the prey's body in their mouth or by attaching like a lamprey and burrowing into prey.

'Serpents' (I don't give monsters names, usually instead letting the players name them). 3m long naga-like reptilians, Their eyes are on long bone spurs (like a hammerhead shark) which give them nearly 360 deg vision. They have lines of tentacles along their lateral ridges (one left, one right) which they can use to trap prey. They have an ovipositor in the lowest appendage. Fertilized eggs are injected into prey and left there, where they become parasites until large enough to burst out and survive on their own.

Hunting Beasts - subterranean burrowers, they have trilateral symmetry. Three rows of 'feet' help them burrow through the ground slowly, setting up ambushes. Their mouths, set on the superior surface of the body, are ringed by long (10+m) tentacles. Hunting beasts will burst out of a shallow burrow, grabbing nearby prey and eating them.

Orcs - Thaks

Goblins - Grebs and Zibs

While searching his room( he's a punk and we search his room every week) we find Gatorade, soda, chips candy etc.. So we ask him how he came to have these items. His response was his friends house. I immediately call BS, and demand to know where it came from, he sticks to his story. 

The next day we find out through friends/Facebook that someone had broke in to the concession stand. I come home from work and we ask him again where he got the items from....he sticks to his story. I take him to the police station yada yada yada 3 hours later he admits to the break in and gives the names of his 2 friends that did it with him. Good!!! I didn't raise him this way and I was not going to stand for this behavior. 

Fast forward 2 months and they all have been to the juvenile board in town and the conditions are they are to complete 100 hours of community service and if not their case heads to the state and would be heard in family court. The damages of broken locks/door/ 2 windows and stolen beverages and snacks was over $2,500. 

So if they don't complete the 100 hours it goes to family court and it's a grand larceny/breaking and entering charge that they will face. I'm not taking that behavior in my house and he knows if he doesn't finish CS he is facing a juvenile felony(?)(that's what we were told). 

So, we had him apologize in person to the little league commission and we had him work with the L.L. to maintain the field all summer (not his community service) and he's lost all video games/cellphone until he completes his hours. I hope he has learned a lesson.","1441065792"

My personal fantasy for how it plays out? Hannibal (after a great deal of effort, because I don't want Alana goin' down easy) has Alana. She's essentially pinned, no hope for escape... when Margot walks in calmly (and fashionably) pointing a gun at him and says ""Walk away, Hannibal. I'm grateful to you, and I respect you, but if you hurt my wife I will kill you without a second thought.""  (and, depending on the nature of the story at that point, makes a pointed threat to Will, too.) Obviously that could just put Margot on the chopping block, too, but Hannibal might respect her moxy? I think it could at least result in a ceasefire for a while. Who knows!

That being said, I largely agree with the previous commenter that Hannibal doesn't see himself as having a nemesis. He has friends,  and he has the rude, and even then everyone is essentially sorted according to how useful they are to him at a given moment.  ","1441065794"

I feel like it has been a rough, anxiety-filled summer for me--too much social media, not enough time off work, and depression creeping in. I decided that weight loss was the one thing in my life I could control. Better than sobbing into a pillow! My goal is a healthy 140 pounds over time.

I have been slow carbing it for around two months. I just started reintroducing carbs last week. I pretty much use MyFitnessPal to keep me around 1,200 to 1,500 calories. I work out with Stepmania and ""running."" I just started yoga-ing it up to try to further center myself.

Humans are trained in math, science, literature, programming, combat, weapon and armor maintenance, and after 200 years the Vault opens up.

What happens? Has the ZAX computer gone mad with power? Has a cult been built around the robot overlords. Did humans try and rebel against their machine masters? How is law and government carried out. Do the humans feel, think, or act differently?

2. If emerging markets are any indicator, subsidies aren't a make or break provision. Citizens in those countries have been buying unlocked phones out right since the industry started.

3. The price of current technology always goes down, it's new stuff that climbs in price and that will not change. Apple or sansung won't introduce new phone for less than the old ones. 

4. Smartphones aren't indexed to tablets or laptops. They aren't comparable. How many buyers are choosing between an ipad and a smartphone. It's the same as when laptops came out and people compared their price to desktops. Different products for different need states and not substitutes. 

5. Margins may contract but it won't be from a reduction in list price. It'll be from higher dealer incentives and kickbacks and financing

6. On healthcare: It's not at all the same thing. A person that has appendicitis can't really opt out of the procedure because it costs a lot.

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I had a fantastic college course called ""intro to entrepreneurship"", and it was super helpful. Here's a few of the activities we did: 

1. We met once weekly for 3 hours, and each week the professor would invite a local entrepreneur to speak to the class for an hour or so. This was incredibly educational and showed not all entrepreneurs are the ones you read about in Forbes. There was a guy who owned a bunch of parking lots around the state, a dry cleaning mogul, a tech startup founder, a financial services / banking ceo, a healthcare company founder and more. Their stories and Q&amp;A was hands down the best part of class. 

2. We had to create a fully fledged business plan from scratch. Pick a new or existing business, and write up an entire plan. Includes market overview, financials, marketing plan, etc. Helped show that starting a business is more than an idea - there's a lot of details to think through. 

3. Our final project was our ""Business for a Day"", where we had to launch a business and run it for one day. The person/team that made the most documented money won some prize (I forget what it was.) We were broke college kids, so it forced us to be creative. Some kids would DD home from bars, others cooked gourmet dinners and went door to door selling to dorms, etc. This taught us the value of execution and showed that even small business ideas can create a lot of value when done right. The winner made $1200 in a day.

Hope that helps!","1441065802"

But, because yours seems like it might be cyclical I thought of allergies, too. Also, maybe in the warmer months you are sweating more and it stays in your pillowcase
 I've read that a lot of people have skin issues because of makeup, sweat, and oil in pillowcases. 

One last thing...in your picture it seemed like maybe your eyes are a little bit dark underneath. Sometimes allergies or nutritional deficiencies can cause that. Best bet is to go to the doctor and ask for an allergy test, maybe blood work, and some type of vitamin deficiency type screening.

I was fortunate enough to be looking for a change in my job when one of the snake farms had an opening. Mine was looking for someone who was willing to learn and work and didn't need reptile experience or a degree as long as they didn't have a fear of snakes (although my schooling and snake experience probably did help). I have heard of people in a similar situation to yours and snake farms tend to be the most common answer.

I would do research as to whether or not there any snake-related businesses are in your area, scour ads, and call them up whoever you can find looking for opening. As far as wages go, it will depend on what the job opening is and what you can negotiate with them. Best of luck!","1441065803"

One I got called was a renovation project where 2 guys literally got buried alive. They were digging a large escalator pit in a building. They had sheet piling in place (and if i remember well with clickers they basically guide to be sure it's all closed). For unknown reasons the sheet piles ripped apart. They supposedly lock each other but this goes (frequently) wrong but because it's in the ground you can't see well. Two guys were at that time down in the pit digging with two small excavators and got buried in there.

Another one a friend (worked for the same company) and was building a small extension at home. He digged out a pit pored a concrete slab with reinforcement. Reinforcement normally for the walls has the rebar ""go through"" up. He was walking along the slab and the ground moved, pushed his body over the rebar and got pierced flat on the slab with the ground covering him. If his wife didn't find him in time he would have bled out.

From http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com//sports/olympics/ioc-reportedly-made-some-ridiculous-demands-to-help-push-oslo-out-of-2022-winter-olympics-bidding

"" They demand to meet the king prior to the opening ceremony. Afterwards, there shall be a cocktail reception.
Drinks shall be paid for by the Royal Palace or the local organizing committee.

Separate lanes should be created on all roads where IOC members will travel, which are not to be used by regular people or public transportation.

A welcome greeting from the local Olympic boss and the hotel manager should be presented in IOC members’ rooms, along with fruit and cakes of the season. (Seasonal fruit in Oslo in February is a challenge…)

The hotel bar at their hotel should extend its hours “extra late” and the minibars must stock Coke products.
The IOC president shall be welcomed ceremoniously on the runway when he arrives.

The IOC members should have separate entrances and exits to and from the airport.

During the opening and closing ceremonies a fully stocked bar shall be available. During competition days, wine and beer will do at the stadium lounge.

IOC members shall be greeted with a smile when arriving at their hotel.
Meeting rooms shall be kept at exactly 20 degrees Celsius at all times.

The hot food offered in the lounges at venues should be replaced at regular intervals, as IOC members might “risk” having to eat several meals at the same lounge during the Olympics.

“All furniture should be OL-shaped and have Olympic Appearance.“

Those are just a few of the demands listed in a 7,000-plus page document listing the IOC’s requirements for the Games.""","1441065807"

He cannot give a true answer, as he would appear even weaker than the Hawks accuse him of being.   This was a political statement, not a statement of policy. 

Are we 100% opposed to the drone program in all cases?   In this context, is a drone necessarily weaponized?

"news","t5_2qh3l","As pointed out below, ALM is clearly trying to co-opt the BLM branding in order to drown it out. It also works to completely erase what BLM is actually saying. If a kid who's starving comes up to you and says ""I need food"", it's a really shitty rejoinder to reply ""We *all* need food"", even if you're also hungry because you didn't get lunch that day. 

The issues blacks face with American law enforcement are specific to their race and a history of legal oppression, whereas the difficulties you might face are more particular to the problems inherent in any system of authority. Saying you like ALM as opposed to BLM is both ignoring and erasing the unique problems blacks experience when confronted by police.","1441065811"

Stuff to remember:

1. **Titles make the post.**  
 Good titles are critical to quality content.
 * Explicitly, the suggest title button is usually terrible.
    
2. **Do people want to see this?**  
Content isn't limited to what's in the suggested submissions list but it's good to go over it.

3. **Is this the original source?**  
Nobody wants to click a link and then click a video. Just link the video.

4. **Can I add value to this post?**  
Most posts benefit from a little elbow grease.
 1. 9 times out of 10 you should link the source, not the article.
 2. Videos are better when linked at the relevant time.
 3. Gifs are easier to enjoy than a video. [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/) has a convenient tool for making them.

If you're good with the conditions above, go ahead and post it on /r/StreetFighter using the link below.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I think it's deliberately left ambiguous but ultimately it doesn't matter because they are the exact same person with the same thoughts and memories so they all think of themselves as the original Angier. It links in to Angier's reaction to learning that drowning is agony and not ""like going home"" (which Cutter/Caine probably only said to comfort him after the death of his wife).

If you had to push me though my guess would be that the original Angier shoots the first clone - shown in a flashback at the end of the movie when he's talking to Borden (one of them anyway I guess lol) - but then in contrast he is the one drowning whenever he does the trick and a new Angier replaces him (this Angier then drowns and is replaced each time etc with the final one being Lord Caldlow). I'm basing this purely on the fact that if it was the original Angier walking into the device then appearing at the back of the theatre then that means the teleportation aspect of the machine would have to actually work. Also quite simply the [scene](https://youtu.be/XHKan75x7GI?t=107) itself makes it look like the original Angier shoots the new one, I think it would be a pretty cheap trick on Nolan's behalf to cause confusion via poor editing.

There's also a theory about how the cloning device doesn't even work. That was my first thought seeing all the duplicate hats and cats (that it was a trick) but still personally I don't think the theory holds much water.

If that quotation wasn't taken out of context somehow, I suspect that the premiere with Bush is going to be a lot more conservative-friendly than Reddit is expecting.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; So if it's medically considered mentally beneficial to surgically remove a limb, surely it must also be mentally beneficial to remove a kidney. 

I don't think that necessarily follows. The kidney need not be part of one's internal body map, and in fact it seems unlikely to be.

&gt; If a mentally ill patient's mind is what the doctors use to justify removing a limb, then there's no legitimate reason to disallow a mentally ill patient the right to have an organ surgically removed if it will benefit the patient emotionally. 

Only if it will benefit them to a degree counterbalancing the resulting disability.

&gt; ""Well, we've already taken your arms and legs. We've removed your genitals and your anus. Fuck it. Let's be mavericks. Oh, but of course we'll have to check with your psychotic psychologist to make sure we've got the 'okay' first.""

You're assuming bad faith on the part of the doctors involved. Is it so hard to think that maybe, just maybe, some of them know what they're talking about? This is like going ""well, if surgery is okay, I bet you're okay with a mad scientist slicing up your heart"".","1441065815"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","My boyfriend and I recently just moved to California together as well--me for work, him for grad school. We went through the exact same thing; no huge arguments or anything like that, but definitely having much shorter fuses and getting upset over smaller things that wouldn't have bothered us back home.

Like other people have already commented, I'd chalk a great deal of this up to the stress of the move (at least that's what I'm almost certain it is/was with my boyfriend and I.) Moving is hard---even if you're not consciously having a difficult time, there are a million and one things that are new and different that you're forced to adjust to.  At least for me, I think it makes me cling a bit more to having things done ""my way"" when I have the power to decide that.  So I want to clean the dishes my way, fold the laundry my way, etc. etc. And then my boyfriend and i end up grating on each other's nerves a bit when he likewise wants to do things ""His way."" Not that dishes or folding laundry are a big deal, but when everything else is new and kind of scary and unfamiliar, we tend to make bigger deals over the small stuff.

I'd say just chat with him. Tell him you're feeling stressed over the move and that you feel like it's affecting your relationship a bit.","1441065815"

I should clarify ... of course raw potato bricks and stubble have differences, but how would the differences act to intensify the affect of what was experimentally tested as being an insignificant cutting angle?

Questions and notes on your thoughts:

* ""They're made of completely different materials."": I think a lot of the strength of a potato is going to be from the cellulose in its cellular walls. This might be similar to the keratin sheath on hair ... or it might not. To me though, while one material may require less force to cut than the other ... how might either be more encouraging of a slicing effect?

* ""Potatoes are bigger than hairs"": Wouldn't this lessen the slicing effect since a hair would be exposed to a relatively much smaller portion of the blade?

* ""blade is held at an angle out from the face"": relative to the the cutting medium (potato/hair) ... most razor blades in DEs are at about a 60 degree angle to the hair (while the cutting force is applied at 90 degrees). While an experiment probably could cut a potato at that angle, I think you'd need a very strong blade to go through the middle. Alternately, an experiment could shave off an end of a potato brick much more easily though ... and this might still be a bit like shaving off the end of beard stubble. That said, I'm not sure how that would make it easier to achieve a slicing effect. It might ... but I just don't understand how.

&amp;nbsp;

Since my prior post, **I have recalled one theory** (made on B&amp;B) that might make a more significant difference:

Beard stubble is anchored in skin, which stretches a bit like rubber. Conversely, the potato brick was firmly held on a rigid platform. The theory was that when a blade's edge makes contact with the stubble ... the stubble might move a little before it gets cut (where stretching resistance is less than cutting resistance) . If the stubble moves a tiny bit before the blade bites into it (and I agree that this seems likely), then it might be more likely to move up the four degree slant (as opposed to down the four degree slant).

That said, I think the curved/angled cross-section shape of stubble which is anchored by the rubbery skin might also be very likely to move one way or the other on a non-slanted razor. I think it likely does move around a tiny bit (one direction or the other) on the cutting edge of a non-slant before the blade is able to bite into the keratin sheath ... so while stubble is likely more prone to a slicing affect than an immobile cutting medium ... I think the question would then be is a 4 degree slant likely to make it slide appreciably further along the blade than a non-slant? Keep in mind that stubble is very thin and will be cut clean through quite quickly, and the skin will also only stretch so much before it's stretching resistance exceeds the cutting resistance between blade and stubble.

&amp;nbsp;


Thoughts? I truly am not ruling out that a 4 degree slant might make a significant difference ... it's just that the journal article's experiment makes me seriously question if such a subtle slant could make a detectable difference....","1441065818"

If that's the case, then wouldn't people using those things coming off of more realistic nicotine levels (ie used to received a full mg per smoke, and used to receiving say 1o-20 mgs a day) go absolutley batshit nuts dropping to 3 mg an entire bottle? I don't know how far a bottle goes, but I guess thats why my friend was vaping her ass off.

&gt;I don't recommend vaping to people who don't smoke. 

That's you.  There's vape/cigar shops around here, and they aren't likely to attract nonsmokers.  Then there's the convenience stores and gas stations that put them right by the registers with their flashy point of sale exhibits and flavors, etc.  I would definitely call that trying to attract new users, not just cigarette smokers. 

Yes, lack of combustion, lack of other chem's,of course ... I ceded that early.   It's not cigarette smoke. And that's great.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;you cannot profit from something that does not involve human labor.

Careful for a moment. You cannot extract a surplus-value from something that does not involve human labour, but you can *profit* from it: Capitalists can exploit surplus-value from one another in the market, and the main way they do this is by investing in machinery that allows them to produce under the SNLT. So while automation does not produce more surplus, it increases the profits of the capitalist that automates *at the expense* of the other capitalists that are behind them in lowering their own SNLT.

/u/DICK_INSIDE_ME :
&gt;You can profit from machines if the machines do the work instead of humans. Eventually the workforce would be entirely replaced by machines, yes, 

Capitalism can't fully replace the workforce with machines with out annihilating itself by making the value-form impossible and redundant. Automation causes temporary or cyclical unemployments but it can't quite cause *permanent* unemployment by making humans themselves outdated (like it did to horses), largely because capitalism *needs* human labour.

If full automation became the norm, not even a Basic Income would save ""capitalism"" because **there could be no commodity production**. A fully automated class society where the rich own all means of production and the non-owners are kept alive by a basic income would be a class society but it would not be capitalism, it would be some sort of post-industrial serfdom.","1441065821"

I never realized how much energy I expended just dealing with her, and on the upset from her constant button pushing. About a year out after I went NC, I had a moment of sudden realization at how amazing it was to feel calm and happy not just on occasion, but as a general normal thing. Whereas I used to have these regular outbursts of me just being upset that I didn't really understand, I now experience them maybe once in three or four years at a much reduced level. I have come to realize they were my safety valve. I had to let off the constant irritation of her upsetting me somehow, and I had been trained not to express that upset at her. I'm also lucky to have a wonderful husband, some great kids, and a large group of good friends who are like family to me.

"StarWarsLeaks","t5_2vflj","Sure, it's plausible. Jar Jar Binks could also be Supreme Leader Snoke. In fact, that's more plausible, as Plagueis is dead.

Jokes aside, it just doesn't work from a story perspective. It completely undermines the original trilogy and takes away from the impact of the Emperor and Vader if they all of a sudden went 'Oh by the way the Emperor had this master that never appeared and he's way more powerful.'

It's also wildly unoriginal. Palpatine was a master manipulator. The only reason he whipped out the Plagueis story in the first place was because Anakin was in a vulnerable state and Palpatine used it to coerce him further to the dark side.

Also, hardly anyone remembers who Plagueis actually is. Those who expect some grand reveal of Plagueis are typically hardcore Star Wars fans. Such a reveal would be most likely received with a resounding 'Who?'

I understand people want it all to come full circle, but that's not what this new trilogy is about. This whole marketing campaign has been about distancing themselves from the prequels (practical effects, character development, unknown actors). To miss out on the chance to create a brand new shiny terrifying villain to shoe horn in 'Darth Plagueis' just doesn't seem like a sweet business move by Disney considering the lengths they've gone too to show that they're trying to do right by Star Wars fans.


But shit, I could be wrong.

TLDR; Plagueis is silly and highly unlikely.

"emacs","t5_2qhwu","There are good aspects for both ""sides"" but I think at the end it is a individual decision between going the hard way (pure emacs) or using something preconfigured. Is that harmful? I don't think so, it is freedom of choice!

Being a vim and sublimetext user for a long time I have found my next step in editor productivity. 
Spacesmacs gives to me modal editing that I missed in sublimetext (the vintage,.. packages are crap compared to ""real"" vim), a very extensible all in all environment (before I was proud of to almost never leave my editor because it handled all text files/langauges, now my editor handles pdf, shell and a lot more) and last but not least a minimal configuration effort (and knowledge about emacs) thanks to the community putting a lot of work into it. 
As allready mentioned the community is very active and helpful (Gitter).

All in all after about 3 weeks of usage I must say that my productivity allready outperformed my former setup and I think that I just scratched the surface of what is possible

By the way, I would never have dreamed of being an emacs user (key chords and so you know ;) ) but with spacemacs the emacs community has a further member ;)","1441065825"

Just heard; ""We did it in the ass, it couldn't of meant nothing for you!""...

**Edit:** Yes, it was the guy who said it

**Edit 2:** Heard; ""I paid for your boob jobs, if you're leaving, I want them back"", What the fuck does that mean? Is he going to take her boobs?

**Edit 3:** Okay, I'm hearing glass getting smashed, that's not good...

**Edit 4:** The term ""Cunt waffle"" was just used, need to remember that one

**Edit 5**: The Guy: ""You were bed hopping like an STD in a third world whore house"" WOW

**Edit 6:** ""I never meant anything to you did I? I fucking loved you"" Yikes, feeling bad for the guy now...

**Edit 7:** So this situation, far as I can tell is; Guy loves this girl, bought her all kinds of stuff, girl isjust using him for money and sex and has someone else (possibly more than one) on the side

**Edit 8**: Heard a third voice, someone else is up there with them...

**Edit 9**: ""You'd rather fuck this turd instead of me?"" OH MY GOD, THAT GUY SHE'S CHEATING ON HIM WITH IS UP THERE WITH THEM

**Edit 10**: More glass smashing, my hand's on the phone, ready to call the cops just incase...

**Edit 11**: Cheating guy: ""I'm a decent guy, I swear"". Boyfriend: ""DECENT PEOPLE DON'T FUCK ANOTHER GUY'S GIRL"". He has a point

**Edit 12**: Someone is knocking on their door

**Edit 13**: Looks like they're ignoring it

**Edit 14**: Whoever's knocking on their door is practically punching the thing down, they're still ignoring it

**Edit 15**: They finally answered, sounds like an old lady, I think she's complaining about the noise

**Edit 16**: Okay wow, whoever answered the door just slammed it shut without saying a word, rude...

**Edit 17**: Girl is making excuses, Guy said; ""You think you can smooth talk me, you fucking cock munching cunt?"" Wow 

**Edit 18**: ""I bet you just love cum don't you, whenever you get thirsty, you must go to a fucking bukkake party"" WOW

**Edit 19**: Dude's crying...

**Edit 20**: Dude's just repeating ""I loved you"" over and over...

**Edit 21**: Girl; ""Maybe we can fix this"", NO, DUDE, DON'T DO IT

**Edit 22**: Guy: ""Fix it? I'd have shock a broken bottle up my cock than sticking it in you again, you cunt!"" FUCK YEAH

**Edit 23**: So the guy who she's cheating with is trying to act as the middle man and calm them both down

**Edit 24** ""GET OUT OF MY HOUSE YOU MOTHERFUCKER, BEFORE I KILL YOU"" was the response from the guy

**Edit 25**: ""I want to forgive you for this, I really do"" NO, NOOOOOOO

**Edit 26**: More door knocking...

**Edit 27**: Door knocking's stopped, no one answered

**Edit 28**: ""No, I'll never forgive you for this"" Glad the dude saw sense...

**Edit 29**: ""I'm taking back everything I gave you"" and something I couldn't make out...

**Edit 30**: I will fucking make you suffer for this"". Finger's on the phone for the cops incase this gets ugly

**Edit 31**: MORE GLASS SMASHING, THAT'S IT, COPS ON THE WAY

**Edit 32**: Someone's beat me to it...""We've already received four calls from the same establishment, officers are on the way"". 

**Edit 33**: Guy's saying ""Just get out of my fucking sight"" on a loop

**Edit 34**: I heard a door slam, I think she left

**Edit 35**: Peered out my doorhole (my apartment's right next to the stairwell), girl has definitely left, she passed by my door, half-dressed too

**Edit 36**: Cheating Guy passed by my door, he was missing his shirt. Looks like this is over

**Edit 37**: Oh shit, I heard footsteps by my door, I think the guy is following them

**Edit 38**: Looked out my window into the front terrace, guy *did* follow them, said ""You left you phone"" and then lobbed it, barely missing the cheating guy, girl didn't even respond and she and the cheating guy got into a car and drove off. It's over guys

**Edit 39**: I can heard the guy on my floor (in the complex, not my actual floor) sobbing, poor guy.

**Edit 40**: Someone is out there, talking to him, trying to comfort him I think

**Edit 41**: Whoever's out there is trying so hard to help the guy. Saying stuff like ""It's not the end of the world"", ""You'll find someone else"" and ""She can go to hell for what she did""

**Edit 42**: Oh, NOW the fucking cops show up...

Okay guys, It's all over so I'm stopping here, the cops are out there talking to the guy and saying the dude's been through some shit is an understatement. Poor guy, don't know him that well but this shit sucks for him. I really hope he'll be okay.","1441065827"

Your appreciation for CiGs work is best expressed through your patience and your ability to act as a brand/game advocate to your friends because word of mouth is a powerful growth tool.

CiG does not need you to sign petitions, they don't need you to try and go out of their way to make them ""feel good"" in fact your attempts at doing that will just create more ""noise"" in terms of signal to noise ratio and make the vocal minority of naysayers scream even louder. It sucks dealing with the negative but in the end it is part of this job.

We (being people working in the industry) love seeing fans be excited about our projects and telling others about them. We know that most forum posting etc is a small minority and that those screaming the loudest are often the most negative, critical, and at times misguided folks who don't represent everyone with their values or opinions.

I'm not 100% sure if I am getting across what I mean but in short. Keep in telling friends how awesome StarCitizen is and giving devs the feedback they need on things in development so they can keep making it great. Don't worry about trying to bolster the teams morale or ""fight the bad guys"" its great intentions but that same energy could be better spent elsewhere.","1441065828"

I don't want to make a TMNT trilogy because I think it would make me money or because I hated the newest TMNT movie and think  we need a reboot (I can't say I disagree with that statement). I would make this trilogy because I have a massive appreciation for the characters and I have a vision for their story that is all my own that I would want to share with the world.

Because of that you have to be aware of any threats and already be moving before it's too late or position yourself where you can get up to speed quickly, like on a downward slope.

The rest though I quite like about the tank, it's gun is very good even while on the move and it's pen (including gold) means you can do damage in any match you get into. The classic light tank circle of death is quite easy with the T37 (provided you're not on the side of a hill, never try to circle on the side of a hill), it's overall mobility means you can flex easily, it's view range is good enough to run optics and makes passive scouting a breeze.

Having said all of that though my favourite T6 light tanks is still the MT-25 but that's mostly because it's blindingly quick, can pen T9s in the arse shooting gold and has a small profile for kemp bush.

I should note however that I love light tanks so there may some bias in what I say.","1441065829"

I would think the vast majority of competitive players would agree that the more layers of RNG you add, the less skill matters. That isn't to say there shouldn't be any or that there aren't exceptions, we are playing a card game after all. Just that in general more RNG is good for causal players, bad for competitive players.

I honestly don't know if my wife would leave me if I left the church but if she did I *would hope* that one day I might come to the understanding that she married me, in part, because of my love and dedication to God and what we both believe to be the church of His only begotten Son. If I were to change that part of me, but her beliefs stayed the same, then it would be an enormous thing to ask of her to see me the same as she always had. 
I know my parents wouldn't disown me because... well they haven't disowned my sister yet and she left the church years ago. Of course they pray for her to come back but they never do it in her presence out of respect for her. ","1441065833"

It helped break up the monotony in a way that I haven't really seen since.

One thing that I think helps in general is having multiple avenues of progression to the same objective, and make challenges that reward progress towards multiple objectives at once.  Doing that allows players to choose a path that fits their preferred play style and lets them do something else if they get bored without feeling like they're sacrificing progress.","1441065836"

"funny","t5_2qh33","I finally bought my wife a new laptop and it had Win 8.1 on it. It was the first exposure I've had to Win 8. Win 8.1 didn't do much to fix the shit Win 8 setup. The ""two worlds"" thing was just clunky. Didn't matter if Win 8 was faster, more stable or whatever, because it was cumbersome to actually use, with the flipping back and forth. 

Within days, I updated to Win 10, turned off all the invasive shit, and now we're back in business. The whole idea of ""apps"" on Windows still seems very unnecessary, but at least I don't feel like I'm living with two divorced parents who have joint custody.

There are many other carpeting plants that are fine in low light. Crypt parva comes to mind.

Also if you want to improve your light (which I suggest if you want to have a planted tank) I suggest a fluval pcl13. It would provide light on the high side of medium. You wont need co2 with this light, but it will grow a large variety of plants easily. It will even grow hair grass, but it will grow slowly and not carpet well.

"kravmaga","t5_2rpbv","Number one is safety.  Injuring yourself is counter productive. You'll have more fun, learn faster, and generally get more out of the experience if you go for quality over quantity.  Pain may be a great teacher, but taking a few weeks off because you broke an arm or your ankle is not worth it.  I broke a metatarsal shortly after starting KM because I was being stupid and not taking the time to learn how to do stuff right before I learned how to do stuff fast.

If you're new to exercise I strongly recommend pre-hydrating.  Start drinking extra water hours before the class.  The average person tends to be slightly dehydrated, so if you wait until the class has started you're going to suffer unnecessarily.

Other than that remember to breath.  Deep breaths, it will help more than you think it might.

Especially in the beginning it is important to do what you can.  When I started I could not do a single pushup.  There were a few other people like me, and when everyone else was doing pushups they'd just sit there and take a breather.  The only way to get better at something is to practice it.  I had to start doing negative pushups, then I had to do knee pushups, and then finally I could start doing normal pushups.  If you put in consistent effort you will get better.  Yesterday someone from the class called me the ""crazy strong"" guy.  Somehow I went from being a flabby artist who couldn't do a single pushup to being the guy people look for when they need furnature moved.","1441065837"

Use Java for your code. There's an addon called [JSoup](http://jsoup.org/) that will help you parse the HTML and whatnot.

Depending on how large the pool of data you want to pull from the website is, you can use a software called [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/) to download a copy of the website or the webpages you need and run your code on that page instead of the live website you want to pull from.

"HannibalTV","t5_2vs7z","People have already made some great replies. For me, the reason why Hannibal isn't just any other killer to Will, and the reason it's been obsessive and even co-dependent, is very much related to Hannibal's manipulations. Especially that he very intentionally made Will feel like nobody else could understand him, accept him, or love him (including aspects of Will that even frightened himself) as much as Hannibal did. In season 1 Will catches on briefly (""Are you trying to alienate me from Jack?"" - bingo) before his encephalitis compromises his lucidity and ability to recognize such manipulation. He was already socially isolated and everyone else either thought he was unstable and distrusted him or used him as a tool to catch criminals, so it wasn't hard to do.

Will seemed to pretty much hate himself for the things that he felt through his empathy, and Hannibal came along and told him his mind was beautiful and nothing to be ashamed of, and he accepted Will for everything he was. When you're in a place of extreme vulnerability, that's hard to resist.

It seems like Will hasn't even been able to be completely honest with Molly about some things. So he still feels like Hannibal is the only one who fully understands and accepts him. And he knows the same is true in reverse.","1441065840"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","One thing Lambert didn't bother to look at were situational start splits. There's [a decent body of evidence](http://www.broadstreethockey.com/2013/4/8/4188626/philadelphia-flyers-goaltending-stats-back-to-back-games) out there that playing goalies in back-to-back games causes them to perform poorly in the second game.

Tuukka Rask very closely followed the trend discussed last season. He was a 0.913 goalie in the second game of back-to-backs (9 starts, 263 shots faced -- small sample size admittedly) and 0.924 in situations with 1+ days of rest. Svedberg was a 0.918 goalie last year meaning that the Bruins would have arguably been better off with the two goalies splitting back-to-backers.

Admittedly, the benefit is pretty marginal. On 263 shots faced, the 0.005 increase to Sv% is 1.3 goals, which at best might mean one of those 9 games finishes differently (note: Rask was 1-6-2 in back-to-back starts). And it only means a Sv% increase to 0.924 (from 0.922) for Rask. His GAA improves from 2.30 down to 2.24. Nothing world changing, but it's still an improvement.

Now let's go a little further. If you decide to put in Rask for Svedberg on days when Rask would have had 1+ days rest, then you also get a 0.006 increase in Sv% over Svedberg's none ""back-to-back relief"" starts, which probably equals more 1.3-1.5 goals saved if you're swapping 9 starts. So overall you could improve the Bruins' fortunes by 2.6-2.8 goals saved over the entire season with some changes to goalie starts, which is a pretty small amount. But it potentially is one that wins 1-3 standings points with some good luck.","1441065840"

(People actually sneak drugs into rehab? Who knew?)

And it was interesting getting to hear some of the horror stories from some of the vets. However:


1- I was an ignorant, smartass teenager, so i thought I knew everything. I thought I was too smart to get truly caught up with drugs, and it ""won't happen to me,"" despite everything I heard and learned.

2- Paradoxically, going to rehab also made me feel like a bona fide druggie. In a way it almost solidified the fact that ""drug user"" was a part of my identity. After all, ""normal"" people don't have to go to rehab...


Don't get me wrong... if the kid's been doing *heroin* for a few months, it's **NOT** too soon for rehab. Heroin can get its claws in quick. But if he's mostly been dabbling with pot, and tried the hard stuff just this one time? Then it might be a slight over-reaction. (Despite what some will tell you-- I knew some kids who dabbled with heroin as teenagers, but never became addicted. it *does* happen. The problem is that everyone thinks *they* are the ones who will get away with it, even when they're not.)

Taking him to an NA meeting could be educational though, and a nice first step if things aren't too severe.

If know how to do it, yes. Without a damn question. 

When the patient is not breathing there's a very finite time before the oxygen runs out in the blood and brain cells start deteriorating. We're talking a few minutes of oxygen deprivation before that happen and everything after that is basically touch and go whether or not the person is going to survive at all. 

So if you know CPR, you're at the scene and the EMT isn't right behind you then the preference is absolutely to perform it regardless of the risk of causing spinal injury, breaking rib-cages or that sort. The patient can live with an injured spine, but not without a functioning brain.

You don't know any item builds, which champions to pick, what role to pick, what each champion does. And on top of that, your first couple games are bound to have smurfs before the smurf detection system can do anything. So in all this confusion of ""WTF am I doing"", you're getting body bagged by smurfs, or having your smurf teammates yell at you because you don't know what you're doing.

The friendly folder is just an easy way to keep track of the good you do. So if you have an interview coming up, instead of scrambling to recall what you've done and what you can say, you can browse in there.

Smoking is dangerous and harmful for you, but so is rich ice cream with chocolate syrup. People get addicted to eating as much as they do smoking, and in America obesity is the number one cause of heart disease, not smoking. Like many enjoyable, yet risky, things in life, smoking should be an informed choice.

For me, smoking is beautiful. In a poetic kinda way, a cigarette kills me while I kill it. We die for each other to enjoy a relaxed moment of tranquility in an otherwise busy world. I've shared cigarettes with lifelong friends, exhausted lovers, eccentric hobos, and prison inmates. Smoking is a release just like a hug from your mom, or a hot shower. It can be a truly wonderful thing.

You could close your eyes and create intense Escher-esque like drawings. We went for a walk and during it felt like the grandest adventure. Your senses are truly warped so everything is just sort of backwards and more interesting. Kind of like when you realize in a dream that something is off.

Another time I took acid, it was horrible. I was scared and nervous the entire time. I felt lost. I could wrap my head around anything. The same things that brought me joy several times before now felt out of my control and scary. I took too much acid that time and I wasn't with people I trusted as much as the first time.

Regular people don't want to play with toxic players like that. 

Responding with ""get a thicker skin"" shows you think toxicity is just part of the game people should put up with.","1441065849"

"ShitRConservativeSays","t5_2xlfc","&gt; Freddie Gray died due to police brutality, in Baltimore, something called 'rough rides'. This is known fact.

It's also a 'known fact' that Gray had a habit of trying to injure himself while in police custody:

http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/baltimore-unrest/report-freddie-gray-hurt-himself-police-van-n350831

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/freddie-grays-injury-and-the-police-rough-ride.html

Whatever happened to Gray has yet to be decided in a court of law. 

&gt; ... completely missing the point of BlackLivesMatter

Most of the officers charged here are not white, AFAIK. 

Let's play devil's advocate and say that Gray's death was the result of police brutality. Courts will find otherwise, but let's say ...

Is that a reason to burn your own city down? Loot? Declare open season on anyone in a uniform? 

You claim the riots were 'wrong', but every other point you're trying to make is still up for debate. A court of law will decide that.

I remember the debate used to be about whether police had probable cause to arrest Gray in the first place. 

Y'all seem to have dropped that narrative in favor of another fiction.

Your budget is bad. If you're living with your parents your expenses should be low and that $500 should be totally manageable since *you're not paying rent*.

&gt;I've never wanted a luxurious life and really I would be happy living in a shithole, working in the service industry, and saving up money to travel every once in a while; I have no dreams of owning a house, buying a car, or needing an big loans in my future

Then why the fuck did you borrow $100k to go to school? None of that required a degree.

You can't transfer the loan. Most student loans are not discharged via bankruptcy anyway (for exactly this reason), so even if you could, you couldn't get rid of them.


The right solution is to grow up, get a job that uses your degree in some way, and pay your debts back. Hell, the job doesn't even need to be related to your degree. It just needs to be full time and not waiting tables.","1441065850"

I feel players would actually be more likely to give commendations to healers or dps who made a great play, participated in objectives than say, the azmodan who was dunking three lanes for half your teams exp contribution the whole match and giving you a 3 level advantage.

Typically an extra valve on a piccolo trumpet is an in-tune substitute for 1-3. For instance, instead of 1-3 for a low D, you would just use 4. It's also used to increase the lower register of the instrument by another fourth. 

However, what you have circled is not a 4th valve. That could either be there as a slide kick trigger or even as a finger rest. Could also be connected to the 4th rotor allowing you to use it with your left index finger (this is a common technique with valved piccolo trumpets).

"history","t5_2qh53","I would like to point out an assumption being made: that the age of the sculpture is the same as the age of the material. The wood may have already been quite old at the time that the item was sculpted. Larches are some of the longest-lived trees in the world. There is at least one subalpine larch in Canada that is almost 2,000 years old. 

Perhaps someone with more expertise in this area can correct me, but I am under the impression that carbon is deposited within a tree as the rings are added. Additional carbon 14 is not added to the middle of a trunk as the tree ages. The carbon age of a sample from the middle of a thousand year old tree would be different than what you would see in a sample taken from just under the cambium layer. Maybe this sculpture is carved from the heartwood of a tree that was cut down when it was over 2,000 years old? ","1441065856"

Pirates of our world were actually quite interesting politically. They voted for their leaders and they were more egalitarian and accepting of who could join them. And being on a ship they all had different roles according to their abilities. And of course they all had equal shares of their 'output'. Where pirates congregated they were in free cities where the rights of each ship were paramount and the State, what little of it was, furthered their commerce. And of course pirates were the ultimate anarchists. 

Of course in the Scar they were still being propelled toward a grand project, similar to the Iron Council. But like the real pirates they were enemies of organized States who abhorred their freedom.","1441065856"

"europe","t5_2qh4j","In France all universities are supposed to offer more or less the same courses with the same level. Generally people just go the University that is the closest, except if they want to study something very specific that is not proposed by their local university. Universities cannot practice selection at bachelor level, except for dual-bachelors and some specific diplomas. 

Now, in practice, all universities are not on the same level, at least in some specific fields. If the level and kind of licences (bachelors) they propose is very often the same, they do distinct themselves when it comes to masters degree as some are very demanded and very selective (in specific domains of law for example). So for example, a student may do his licence (bachelor) of law at the University of Bordeaux and then try to get a place in a selective master in universities like Paris II Panthéon-Assas and Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne that are quite reputed in law. 

There's also the question of research, some universities tend to attract the best academics and are better ranked internationally. (UPMC in hard sciences, Paris I and Paris IV in History for example). Now rankings are inconsistant, Paris I ranks very well in QS rankings, while in the Shanghai ranking the University of Paris-Sud or the University of Strasbourg (very good in biosciences) do better. 

But on a national level we do not rank our universities like American or British do, there might be some newspapers that ranks masters in specific domains (like which universities offer the best masters in finance or law) but rankings and fight for prestige is really something that concerns the Grandes Écoles, which are smaller schools that are very selective. Grandes écoles include business schools, engineering schools, institute of political sciences, the 4 ENS (écoles normale supérieure, they form the best professors) and some other schools in specific domains.

Business schools put a lot of efforts to be the best ranked and more reputed. The best Business School has consistently been HEC (and it has also been the best or second best in Europe for years). The best Engineering School is Polytechnique. And the best in research in humanities, social sciences and hard science is the École Normale Supérieure (especially the one in Paris). I'd say that the ENS is the more prestigious school : entrance exams are insane and the school have produced lots of Fields Medal recipients (all French recipients but one) and very reputed philosophers and historians.

"science","t5_mouw","It might be useful to have videos of what those conducting the study considered to be fast eating, and then have the participants in the study choose one.  I don't think this could be a directly observed activity, even if double blinded, because those who know they are being observed, may willfully slow down.  Eating speed is also affected by satiety, and a safe amount of fat early in or part of the meal will induce a sense of satiety than without, the latter ultimately resulting in an overall increased intake of calories.  

I think it is a logical hypothesis that there is some correlation between speed of eating and metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Those conducting the study felt the weakness of it to be by self report, and generally I feel that way about studies,  but I am not sure that there is in this particular aspect, a better way.

""She deflects"" are the most important words in that last sentence, just to be all kinds of clear.  If *she* wants things to improve communication between you, *she* should cut out the guy she's been talking to instead of you.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I want to help you, but you have to be sure.""* He didn't *want* to help her. He wanted something she could provide. She finally unfurled her fingers from the sketchpad she'd been holding tight against her chest, furrowing her brows down at the White Hart that stood proud, and regal in the forest.

&amp;nbsp;

What was it Alesander had said? *""I'm not sure you'll need to hunt for the White Hart anymore.""* She didn't need the Hightower's assistance. *What if there's backlash for the King's decision?* Alesander was king. He could make up his own mind, marry who he pleased. But then, wasn't there a Dornish princess here for that very purpose? Why else would she be here, so close to the king? Weren't there politically better options? *What if the North wants to secure an alliance before they depart?* The thoughts whirled in her head so quickly that she dropped to a stone bench, devoid of her typical grace - gaze distant, as she struggled with moral conundrums.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Though I'd say this, if the Stranger came for you now, he'd have to wait for me to be tired of your company to claim your soul. And if that was the case, you'd live forever.""* The king's words rang through her mind, a reminder of what she could accomplish on her own. Lord Hightower was right in one respect - she didn't need to be a man to make her way in this world, or to earn the king's attention...she didn't need the other nobleman's assistance. For now...for now, she would let such thoughts simmer. Wait, and listen. Hold the offer close to heart, and see what life offered her.

What I've been told is to work with your 5 senses. 

Sight: Pick an object in the room and describe it in as much detail as you possibly can. Alternatively, you can look around the room and name colors that you see or count the number of certain objects. 
Hearing: Close your eyes and try to identify three sounds. Focus on listening to each sound for about 30 seconds. 
Touch: Running your hands under cold water, holding a rough rock paying attention to its texture and weight in your hand (and this one sounds really strange), but put an orange in the freezer for a little bit then squeeze it in your hand. 
Taste: this one is a little trickier, but chewing different types of gum helps.
Smell: Essential oils. Depends on what you like, but certain scents help with certain feelings. And the scents can help bring you back to the here and now. 

I apologize for the wall of text, but I hope this helps you. :)

Then we see all sorts of hash from the middle east and other places... We would LOVE to put some in some rubbing alcohol and through a coffee filter see what gets left over. Even the wax and concentrates we see are way below our standards. If you are still blasting flower with BHO PLEASE STOP &amp; buy yourself a closed loop system.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","&gt;I guess the position that Greens supporters take on the issue is that both of the majors have devised and implemented mandatory detention of asylum seekers in a range of desperate bids to be the ""toughest"".

Yes, that seems to be the case, which is unfortunate because a range of differences exist between ALP and LNP that translate into very different approaches to being ""tough"" on refugees.

&gt;Aren't a lot of those things you mention Labor doing a direct result of Greens and community pressure? In effect, they've been wedged and absolutely had to do something in order to not appear as draconian as the LNP.

To claim that ALP policy is somehow a direct result of the Greens is a bit much. Greens have no say in ALP policy and any influence they might exert is marginal. Community pressure, sure, but there was a strong push within the ALP for better asylum seeker policy as well. The section on refugees within the draft national platform underwent several substantial additions before being endorsed by Conference delegates.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","If the Means of Production are what create all the necessities of life, Capitalists withhold them from people who need them, through the system of Capitalism.

People go hungry in say, America, not because there isn't enough food, but because the fields and seeds are owned by private individuals, who use the land and it's produce however they wish, which often means depriving it from those who are hungry.

People struggle to put a roof over their heads, because someone else owns the house, and to live their, you have to pay rent, otherwise you'll be battered by heat, cold and wind.

The worker works in a factory, works the machines that the capitalist owns, the thing which he produces is not his but the owner of the factory. In return for working in the factory, the pays his worker a market determined price for his labor and keeps the rest-the surplus value- for himself. The worker is cheated out of the full value of his production, but he often has no other option but to work for the capitalist. 

Poor nations are not poor because they cannot produce anything of value, they produce quite a lot, but since the factories, mines and fields are owned by foreign capitalists who take the wealth created in that nation, and take it to a richer one. Nations that have famines don't die by the millions because their is no food, the food is exported or the land is being used by capitalists to produce cash crops for foreign markets. ","1441065863"

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","indeed, and there is NOTHING stopping you from using modern marines and painting them in 30k color schemes or tarting them up with relic weapons or armor bits.

plenty of normal marine kits out there that are significantly cheaper that have relic power swords and bolters and helmets and its surprisingly easy to make an army that feels late 30k esque.

watch this, this is me doing a dark angels heresy era army using modern 40k models

wut u need:

new interrogator chaplain (causes hes wearing older model power armor thats been tarted up with modern pads and a few icons of the god emporer)

you then buy all the normal marines you want and use these:

http://www.games-workshop.com/en-CA/Dark-Angels-Upgrades

http://www.games-workshop.com/en-CA/Armour-Through-the-Ages

http://www.games-workshop.com/en-CA/Sternguard-Veteran-Squad

http://www.games-workshop.com/en-CA/Space-Marine-Command-Squad

http://www.games-workshop.com/en-CA/Dark-Angels-Company-Veterans-Squad

to tart them up, the command squad set contains lots of relic guns, and the armor through the ages gives you basically 5 legion marines right there, the chapter upgrade sprue gives you the pieces to at least create the illusion of a relic armor set on some marines, the veterans box contains plenty of relic power weapons lots of icons of old caliban for decorating vehicles and terrain

go out on ebay, get some relic heads off ebay maybe pickup a few older model marines from 3rd or 4th edition and you can make some jolly good space marines for noticeably cheaper

if you want vehicles go to ebay plenty of guys on there trying to pawn off old model rhinos and predators which are the same as the forgeworld variants except they have some unique weapons options that can (relatively) easily be grafted on or modded on

this largely leaves the dreadnaughts and terminators and well theres not much u can do about terms we dont have their skins im sorry but in the new horus heresy starter box we get some plastic ones so there might be that as an option. and mortis and deredeo dreadnaughts are just something i cant find a solution for beyond buying a knockoff from a certain subreddit that totally doesnt exist where you can download a flyer and file a mail order out to china to have them cast you a model on request (or so ive heard thats strictly rumor, yep).

"technology","t5_2qh16","I hate to say it but the employees at HP and in the general tech sector are free to unionize. HP is likewise free to replace them with non-union employees if the negotiations fail. The whole concept of unions in a free market is that workers are negotiating to sell their labor which the company wants to purchase at the lowest price possible, if the company doesn't like the union price it can try to purchase labor from someone selling it cheaper. 

If the tech sector wants to organize and monopolize the supply of labor in that market the onus is on them. At that point they can demand whatever wages/terms they want which the company can either accept, or as they did with the manufacturing sector relocate to Mexico/China/India/ect.

Tech is a sufficiently high-skill/in-demand field that monopolizing the labor supply is probably feasible with good organization, but the very premise of what a union represents (a labor monopoly) is pretty much the exact reason why the people trying to unionize Walmart/McDonalds are idiots. Any person on the street looking for work is capable of unskilled work like stocking a shelf or running a cash register with minimal training. That's why it's called ""unskilled"" labor. Hence why in the event of a strike/unionization attempt Walmart can pull any asshole off the street and have him doing that job in under an hour of training, thus there's no realistic way to monopolize the entire unskilled labor market in America.","1441065868"

"excel","t5_2qur2","How Excel deals with all time and date data is fundamentally simple. Both are represented by a single rational number.

Clock time and stopwatch time are the same underlying data, a number. The first is a point in time and the second is a period. Excel can interpret and display the number as either. You tell it what to do using formatting.

A period of 6 hours is one quarter of a day and is (beneath any formatting) just the number 0.25. 23 minutes and 15 seconds is just the number 0.0161. You can see this if you enter 00:23:15 then format the cell as Number.

To display a point in time, either as clock time e.g., 6:00 AM or a date time combination 1-Sep-2015 6:00 AM, Excel interprets the number as the number of days since the beginning of the year 1900. 1-Sep-2015 00:00 is 42248 and 1-Sep-2015 06:00 is 42248.25 (add a quarter of a day for the 6 hours since midnight).

What you're dealing with are two different problems

* How Excel is interpreting your input (reading 00:23:15 as 0.016)
* How Excel is displaying the data (displaying 0.0161 as 12:23:15 AM in the formula bar)

The reason, as others have pointed out, that you're getting 11:15 PM is Excel is interpreting 23:15 as 0.97 instead of 0.016. Just remember that while Excel will use the clock time in the formula bar (which is why you see 12:23:15 AM in there) it is really still 00:23:15 when you format the cell as [h]:mm:ss.","1441065869"

I still smoke on occasion, especially when drinking.  My rationale is that it feels and tastes good (even though it both feels and tastes gross at the same time.) That life is short, and it probably wont be me that gets one of the cancers. That Ill probablu get one of the cancers regardless, etc.

No one on this planet will appeal to everyone, not one single person as our preferences are widely different.

Dating/Developing a relationship is a process that requires effort, when you actually meet someone who is right for you, it will all feel very natural and smooth, almost as if you don't have to really make much of an effort in order to please the other individual.

Regardless of your age or where you are located, every thing we encounter in life is an experience, both the good and bad will help shape you. Understand that sometimes it make take a long while before you run into someone who is even decent, and perhaps even then, your own requirements will, will make that person be unsuitable for you. As such humans place different importance on various areas, I feel in general the more open minded you are, the greater the chance is of finding someone who will reciprocate your feelings.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","I literally just had this happen today. One team was just stupid strong, they had like 3 heavies each with a pocket medic, like 3 or 4 engies all with full nests set up, and they were in OUR base. We couldn't get through more than 2 doorways without being filled full of bullets. The only reason we even managed to stay alive was their powerhouses kept dying. It wasn't until their top-player got bored and left that we actually managed to get out of spawn. We pushed them back, and slowly but surely we won. Next round, they must have all been in disbelief because we steamrolled, they didn't even have a single person to contest mid. Come back after getting vote-scrambled (I initiated it), and its a fairly opposite game. This time we're the ones with 4 sentry nests, and they're the turtles.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","The speed of change has nothing to do with whether or not government is good at social change or not.  There are very good legal reasons for people to be hesitant about legalizing or decriminalizing pot. I'm for it in principle but the bills on my state's ballot don't have anything to our specific laws regarding driving under the influence. 

Change is slow because society is complex. It's often frustrating but that also is part of what makes government good at change. When change is too fast people can't adjust. If change were really fast all the time then there would be little cohesion nationally.

Often conservatives are on the wrong side of history and various inevitable social changes, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve a voice in democracy. Government's job isn't only change, it's also to enforce existing law. If change isn't fast enough for you, then you need to do a better job of persuading your fellow countrymen and representatives because that's who is in charge, ultimately. ","1441065875"

In my area almost all rehab is done out of private homes by licensed individuals working out of their own pocket. Many of us also volunteer in conservation and education. There's no reason that one has to exclude the other. 

The other thought I have, is that in areas where there are no rehabbers, there is still a need for them, so people left with no rehabber to contact may attempt care on their own with no training and frequently bad information. Even in the age of google, there is more bad info about wildlife rehab on the internet than accurate info. When untrained people try to rehab wildlife, while their intentions are good, the outcomes are frequently bad. Metabolic bone disease is commonly seen in animals in these situations, as well as animals with potentially zoonotic infections that go unrecognized until it's too late.

Wildlife rehabilitation is an essential part of the puzzle of conservation, not some drain on resources.","1441065879"

Are you talking about when she said she wanted to kiss her again after returning from the alternate timeline? If so, then that's really not strong proof..

"bleach","t5_2rk7q","My theory is that:

1/ Ryuken didn't want Ishida to get involved with the Shinigamis because Quincies and Shinigamis are natural enemies, because a Shinigami was guilty of Masaki getting hurt in the first place, marrying Isshin (a Shinigami) instead of Ryuken, and getting his father killed by the Shinigamis. Then, his son does something stupid, and Ryuken, not having a good relationship with Uryuu, doesn't care until he sees Uryuu getting wrecked by a hollow. I suspect, though, that having Uryuu's powers restored was related to the rise of the Wandereich. I can get why he doesn't want Ishida to deal with Shinigamis, they are natural enemies.

2/ I guess, since Ryuken kind of retired from being a Quincy, Yhwach doesn't care about taking him to the Sternritters. He already has Uryuu there. I wonder, though, if Ryuken is also like Yhwach or Haschwalth, capable of distributing the power, or if him restoring Uryuu's powers came from a discovery made by Soken on his research with the Letzt Stil. 

I'm sure he'll show up at one point, and I have a feeling he will support the Shinigamis, just so he can avenge his wife. ","1441065880"

"Cartalk","t5_2s47e","Hi, career VW/Audi (Now Bentley) mechanic here, I can definitely help you. 

First, I would like to explain what is happening to your car, and then I will explain how to fix it. 
Your ""N-80 Evaporative Emissions System Solenoid Purge Valve"" is fouled with charcoal from the ""Evaporative Emissions Charcoal Canister"" and is stuck open. This is normally caused by raw fuel getting into the charcoal canister, usually from ""topping off"" the fuel tank after the pump ""clicks off"" when filling the tank. The fuel backs up into the charcoal canister and breaks up the charcoal inside. Eventually these broken bits of charcoal work their way through the purge line and get lodged in the purge valve, which causes the valve to get stuck open. This causes the small leak or very small leak condition. 

The easy fix is to just replace the N-80 Purge Valve...but the charcoal canister is compromised, so it will only be a matter of time before the new valve gets fouled and sticks open as well. 

SO...the correct repair is to replace the charcoal canister, blow out the purge line, and replace the purge valve....and never *EVER* ""top off"" the tank after the click!!!   

I hope this helps!

ETA: Like some others have said...this is the most common scenario. I obviously cannot diagnose your car across the Internet. A proper smoke check and function test of the electric components would be needed to properly diagnose the condition. With that said...I've seen enough fouled N-80 valves to feel pretty confident in this.","1441065883"

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","I will gladly explain my point of view and what I think makes most logical sense, 'cause that's what I do:

Mega Lopunny's design is like that because it's design is directly based off of Cammy. It's paying homage - the similarities are too great for this to be a coincidence, especially as Cammy is a well-known character.

Bulbapedia is written by fans *(who often-time don't use common sense, speaking from experience)*, and playboy Lopunny idea was huge among fans when lopunny was first introduced *(pokemon fetish is a thing so people shouldn't be surprised, it's just sad non-fetishists latched onto it as well)*, so many take it as official fact, but without more obvious and direct references, Bulbapedia's assumption is irrelevant. 

My theories have closer references than just 'it's a feminine looking rabbit'; one ties in with Diggersby, one is based on Lopunny's Klutz ability and the third is mega Lopunny's design which just looks too similar to Cammy to not be a loving reference.

If Lopunny had something like a bra-like marking, which Nintendo wouldn't be beyond adding (Nidoqueen, Gorebyss), or maybe a marking resembling the typical [Playboy costume](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=51335159), I would've considered that the reference is there, but it doesn't. A known symbol of Playboy bunny, which they have on the logo, is the necktie/bow, if Lopunny had anything resembling a bow like that, I would've also considered it, but it possesses none of the typical associations with Playboy bunnies - it is a rabbit with a feminine figure and this is the only thing that made people assume she's based on Playboy bunnies, and yet with that mindset the reference might've as well been [Lola Bunny](http://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/2014/09/24/807/n/3019466/345ad29b09e752cf_Vlcsnap-2013-02-04-12h32m53s33/i/Space-Jam-Lola-Bunny-Inspiration.png), so why aren't people assuming that?","1441065884"

"Accounting","t5_2qw2b","I just finished my auditing course last week! It was all conceptual and the only math involved was calculating materiality. It was one of the easier accounting courses for me.

This main idea behind the course was AUDIT RISK and MATERIALITY. Audit risk is the risk of giving an inappropriate audit opinion (you say financial statements are free from material error when they actually aren't.)

The key is to really identify potential issues and how they affect your audit, and what you will do about them. That was 50% of my final exam. Make sure you have a very clear understanding of balance sheet and income assertions. You need to make sure you have a firm understanding of what your professor expects of you. Most students struggle putting their responses into concise and coherent responses. 

We had a big group project auditing a corporation and our downfall was that we outlined the big issues, but we didn't discuss thoroughly enough how it will affect our audit and how we will use specific auditing techniques/method to reduce audit risk relating to that issue. 

Study techniques, look at your professors answer key (if one is provided) to the big wordy problems. This will illustrate what she is looking for in a good answer. 

Good luck!","1441065885"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Alright here goes, say hello to Leon the beast tamer!

Bio: intro type thingy

&gt; Leon is a known across all of Runeterra for his amazing gift with his circus of animals, he has been seen all over doing amazing shows for citizens of Demacia, Noxus, the Freljord, and in fact there's not many places he hasn't been. But one day, he had found himself making his way to a new town to perform at when his caravan was attacked by Bandits and a hooded figure with a weird boomerang blade. They were out to steal his animals! Grabbing his nearby whip, Leon tried to fight off most of the bandits. Unfortunately, they were able to get away with all but one grey Dire wolf. To this day, he has been training himself and his wolf to get revenge for his lifetime's work. He then saw that the Bandit Leader was a member of the League, and made his way onto the battlefields of justice to get revenge.

Passive: Beast Tamer

&gt; Leon's Dire Wolf's stats scale with Leon's (40% [working on numbers]). Also, whenever Leon kills a large monster, it will be reborn and be under his control for a short period of time (Leon can only have one monster at a time not including Baron or the Dragon). If Leon's Dire wolf dies, it will respawn after 30 seconds (time decreases with levels). Note: all controlled creatures can be controlled with alt + click (similar to Tibbers).

Q: Whiplash

&gt; Leon strikes in a line with his whip, dealing more damage at the edge of his range (this attack can critically strike). if Leon hits a creature under his control it gains a small boost to attack speed and movement speed and cleanses all movement impairments.

W: Savage strike/whistle

&gt; Savage strike: if Leon's Dire wolf is alive,  it will leap forward and cleave in front of it dealing (50/60/70/80/90) (+15%AD) to all units in a small radius.
 
&gt; Whistle: if his Dire wolf is not alive, Leon will whistle for a new Dire wolf to come in his place. Whistle has triple the mana cost of Savage strike

E: Crowd pleaser

&gt; Leon throws out a hoop of fire dealing a small damage over time to nearby units. If Leon's Dire wolf jumps through during a savage strike, it will gain a temporary flame shield that will burn nearby enemies. this effect applies to ghost wolves as well (stacks with multiple wolves).


R: Leader of the pack

&gt; Leon calls for additional support, 2 mirror wolves come to his aid for a brief period of time. These wolves have the same stats as the current Dire wolf. Additionally, Leon and all wolves gain a bonus to movement speed as long as

This leads to the bad tracking you see in your vids.  Also your recoil control at long range is kinda mediocre, but that is pretty easy to fix.  

Another thing that I noticed is crosshair placement.  Take the first video: you are underneath the gen in a tech plant side building, and you start sweeping from the right to left.  The vast majority of your enemies are going to come in from the door, which means they are going to be on your left.  *THE ONLY TIME* you are going to need to acquire someone on the far right side of your screen is when they jump down, which is far less likely than them running around from the backdoor.  That saves you time when you end up in a 1v1.  

Also you are playing pretty passively, although not the most passive I've seen on this subreddit.  Learn when to push, but fix your aim first.  If you have to just practice in VR until you can turn around and instantly acquire targets heads (depending on your sens, this might take you a while).

"speedrun","t5_2sf9e","Thank you for the post btw.

Glitching into tourian was around long before the super metroid community at srl even had a discussion on wether we were going to call it any% or something else.  There was no real consensus on what to call it (I think alttp ""any% NMG"" was called legacy at the time),  and the glitch run had been called any% glitched for awhile already.  Seems like the feeling then was: why force a change in the way the categories and the naming had naturally evolved?

There still seems to be a few (or less) people who, while having nothing to do with the super metroid community, are very vocal about the terms being wrong or dumb.  But like you said, come on man, everybody who cares knows what the hell we're talking about, and it's a semantics argument anyway.  (Do you qualify your definition on what is restricted from being used or by what abnormality is allowed?  What is the normal way of playing through a game?)

I'm glad the focus in super metroid is much more in the category that actually plays through the game quite proper, and I'm not a person who hates glitches.  I love mega man 1 and 2 with zips and find the no zip runs more boring.  But unlike a lot of games, this one is concise enough, and has great enough mechanics, movement, and variation in boss fights to where it's way more interesting not to break things.  I think not calling any% some silly technical term reflects this feeling, but I understand if someone disagrees.

I'll add this quote from gari, I used it in my sda submission and I like the way it explains the category.


""Definition for Traditional style Super Metroid any%:

-Defeats the main four bosses depicted in the statues blocking entrance to Tourian (Kraid, Phantoon, Draygon, Ridley) and goes on to defeat Mother Brain as well and go through the escape sequence.

-Stays within the boundaries of the map and limits the use of clips to entirely in boundary use (Wrecked Ship ceiling clip, Zebetite Skip)

-Does not use the GT Code

-No Abuse of Space/Time Beam or its variants
     
The heart and soul of the traditional any% category is to encapsulate the feeling it was to go through the game after first play and try to go through it as fast as possible. All exploits are done with the intention of working around the general design of the game, not the programming and/or its oversights.""","1441065891"

I made what would be considered a fast recovery. I went from complete paralysis of my shoulder to good quality of movement in under nine months, full range of motion not soon after that, and I was doing pullups/pushups and fairly serious weight lifting within a year or so. 

For what it's worth I will just list the supplements I took at the time (and continue to take). I'm not saying any of them have a damn thing to do with my recovery but hey, maybe you can take them and then do research as you see fit. 

* Vitamin D3 - 5000 IU/day
* Creatine 
* Rhodiola Rosea (Gaia)
* Turmeric Supreme (Gaia)

Other than that, my goals were to make sure I slept well, ate well, and got a moderate amount of exercise but I backed off my usual training which tends to be a little bit on the strenuous side. For some reason I got it into my mind that I didn't want to deplete myself. I was more inclined to take days off from working out than any other period in my life, and I really listened to my body. 

And I'm sure you already take or have tried Gabapentin for nerve pain, but just an aside, it did seem to help take the edge off for me. All I know is that if your pain is anything like mine, even a little pain relief is appreciated where possible. ","1441065892"

It's not that she can't hear you, it's that she can't listen.  What can you do about that?  Nothing.  ""There are none so blind as those who will not see.""

You can't force a person to ""understand"" something so simple, likely because they already do understand it but refuse to be persuaded.  That's a choice they're making, not a failure to explain on your part.  It can be hard to realize that in your position.

This is a very difficult type of person to deal with (especially with the alcoholic tendencies) and even if she were to allow herself to be persuaded, I have a feeling you'd be in the doghouse over this for a very long time.  And why should you be?  You did a nice thing for a friend, period.  All your SO had to do was read her texts and understand them.  Why can't she?

If your SO has a problem with that, considering how you went out of your way to involve her in each step along the way, you should not subject yourself to the pain that she's going to bring next.  My advice would be to get out of this before you exhaust yourself and become a bitter person.

Otherwise, be on the lookout for having to spend the next 6 months always trying to 'explain' this situation to her and her never 'understanding'.  Good communication is so important in any type of relationship and some people are just not ready yet.

"FictionBrawl","t5_2x101","""Brooke! You-AAHH!"" Aaron hunched over. With ragged gasps, he thought, *Time to end this shit.*

He kicked out behind him at Inés, then turned and thrust two daggers at his gut from his close range. He lashed out with another kick, and began to run away, slowing down due to the poison. Once he was sufficiently out of range, he willed the arrows on Inés' shield to explode,  the ones caught by Ulia's, and those on Leland, too.

He more or less stumbled into Brooke's arms, but she quickly healed away the poison. He got up.

""You know, you should really calm-""

Aaron didn't hear what the rest of Brooke said. He dashed towards Valan, armor forming around his head and covering his face, his eyes no longer visible from behind the spectral purple energy. Another Xiphos came to him, and he slashed downwards on Valan.

Amy caught the arrows, and intended to get one last use out of them, tossing them towards Anna, from two opposing directions, trying to get her to run into at least one no matter how she tried to flip out of the way of the other.

With a sad, tiny *plink* noise, the arrows bounced off of Oak. He looked over to Ryck, and willed more plants to come out of the ground and grapple him into submission.

To keep Ulia's attention, he made more branches poke out from the ground, intent on hitting her from behind.","1441065893"

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","AI vehicle weapons are weak and limited compared to AV options, and that is still the case even when splash is weaker across the board at present.

That only leaves one route: qualitative change rather than quantitative.

What does infantry have that vehicles don't?  Breaching nades.  That's EMP nades, flash bangs, concussion nades and smoke nades.

Ergo, give AI weapons secondary qualitative effect.  Maybe it should affect on only empire specific options, or maybe it should only be part of primaries.  Should the Marauder get a flash bang effect?  Should the PPA carry an EMP effect that doesn't work against non-MAX vehicles?  Would a concussion effect work for the C85?

Smoke would be a great addition for slower firing AI weapons.  For example, if the zephyr was a single shot with a couple of very large radii, it would be great for smoking an area.  Likewise with the other single-shot AI primaries.

Many of the NS AI vehicle options do need a quantitative update.  Kobalts, for example, need to be considered stabilized and lean a little less on burst fire.  A larger caliber bullet should hit for more than 154 at 110m.  Each round should probably do as much as a battle rifle round.","1441065893"

You should not feel this way after a breakup. You should feel relief. You don't feel relief? You probably made a big mistake.

We could not find the source of it, but everyone kept commenting on the odor.  Finally, at the end of the day, I asked my coworker if the odor could be coming from his bag.  He thought for a moment, then the lightbulb turned on.  He dug into his bag and pulled out a ziplock baggie of hard boiled eggs.  The smell dramatically increased upon the appearance of the eggs.  Turned out he had stuck them in there for lunch one day and forgotten about them.  About a week earlier.  So, to answer the question - eggs.  ","1441065897"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Yi does not have the blademaster thing down; he has the agility swordsman thing down.  He isn't a one-with-all-blades master; he's a one-sword character whose primary ""fantasy"" is that he is the fastest - he moves and strikes so quickly sometimes the enemy doesn't even know how many times Yi hit them.

A Blademaster or Weaponmaster is truly a God of technique - he can attack in so many ways it'll make you dizzy. His mastery is in his skill, not his speed. This is why a blademaster would have a kit that is like Invoker from DotA but melee; he can always surprise you - his order of strikes is always different and has a different effect. That's a blademaster. Yi is just the fastest swordsman around, sort of like how Yasuo is the master of sword+wind.

You are literally making a super enemy that can only be stopped by another fed carry or a really bad misplay. If they know what they are doing they will take that advantage and roam to transfer the advantage into every lane. This can be a very frustrating mechanic in a unorganized solo q type game. 

Also, when it comes down to dcs and afks in most Mobas a 4v5 is relatively hopeless unless the skill gap is ginormous. Even then ending the game would take forever. At least in games like cs go you can usually have a glimmer of hope in playing 4v5. ","1441065898"

"Wrangler","t5_2u1rr","Bigger tires get your entire jeep lifted (including the lowest parts of your axles) so it's a lift all in of itself. Whatever tire you go to, if it's 3 inches bigger than stock you've just given your jeep a 1.5"" lift. Hope that makes sense.

After having built one and now on to my second build... My best advice would be to figure out exactly what you want from your jeep then make a plan and stick to it. 

For me...recovery is key. I HATE getting stuck. Winch is necessary for my  builds. Just piece of mind. And when I've had to use them, they've paid for themselves quick. Your trail buddies will appreciate it as well. ;)

Good jack (farm-all/hi-lift). Good tires. 

As far as wheels go, you can find offset steels at a decent price. For a little bit more you can get actual bead locked wheels. This was a place I went cheap on in my last build and regretted after. Being able to air down gives you a ton more traction. Yes you can air dwn without beadlocks, but not as far or as safe. Of course if you're just hitting back country dirt roads and easier trails this isn't a big deal.   I'd have spent more on my wheels and less on my tires. Get a tire with three or more plies on the sidewall. I personally think the wrangler kevlar thing is a gimmick.  I also find that tire-poke the offset wheels give you to be an appealing look :)

I'm building a wrangler now. '05 LJ. First up is maintenance and mechanicals since I bought a used rig. Tuneup. Axle inspections. Lube and lube changes where needed. Brakes needed help. Etc.

Second: recovery. Like I said. Hate being stuck. Shovel. Farm all jack. Come along or winch. Tire changing tools. More tools. Even more tools.  Tire chains (winter is coming!) Gear on its way as well as storage locations to store the gear. These wranglers have jack for gear storage. At least mine does. 

Third: Range. 200~miles to a tank? I've got two Jerry cans getting mounted soon for an extra 10 gallons fuel. 

Fourth: not sure yet. Going to be pretty satisfied once I'm here. New tires probably. Lights. Definitely need a few more lights. Oh...CB Radio (your local club probably requires this item)

Make a plan. You can spend way way way lots of money on things. And everyone you go out wheeling and think ""I could have used _______"" write it down and add it to your gear.

Have fun!","1441065899"

"Pauper","t5_30kju","Cloud of Faeries is dominant, pervasive, and is keeping other decks from experiencing success. Someone else mentioned Birthing Pod in this thread and while not a perfect articulation it fits.

Cloud of Faeries is an engine. It has been at the top of the format for years and is dominant (I don't think this point is being contended). At the same time its presence is keeping other decks from competing. The Delver/Cloud/Sprite draw locks lots of decks out of even getting to play **Magic**. When people don't get to play games, Wizards tends to ban (see Second Sunrise).

It's more egregious in Esper Combo. Can the combo be disrupted? Yes. However it is incredibly resilient, and the fact that hate does exist and yet the deck continues to perform at a high level.

My issue with the Brainstorm comparison is this: legacy, in some part, is a format built upon Brainstorm. You remove it and many (read more than two) important archetypes crumble or must severely adapt. Brainstorm also has more strategic implications than Cloud of Faeries (just from number of cards seen).

Cloud if removed would hinder one deck and cripple another. At the same time I believe (and yes to be fair I don't have evidence of this) it would allow other decks room to breathe and develop. Maybe we won't see a proliferation of new decks, but I have to think we'll see some.

We will also see more players. Anecdotal to e sure, but the number of people who reach out to me saying ""I would play Pauper but Cloud of Faeries ruins the format"" is far higher than I would have thought (it probably averages out to three or four per week when it comes up on twitter).

Boken, wasters, shields, staffs... all kinds of stuff.. well one night after packing everything in for the night (this is about 9:30) the group goes in side, lowers the shades and proceeds to PARTY. everyone drinking, girls getting naked, general debauchery.. when suddenly ""BOOM BOOM BOOM"" pounding on the door. Our.. less then average intelligence friend opens the door, closes the door and yells ""COPS"". My brother and i (being oldest[and no, not of legal drinking age]) grab our friend, throw him out of sight of the door, and step outside to speak with the officers, closing the door behind us. The officers lead off the conversation...

""We got reports of... jousting?"" 

""Oh no officers, there was no jousting here.. jousting requires horses."" 

At which point the officers look at each other and back at us..

""You boys drinking tonight""

""Little bit""

""You over 21?""

""Yes sirs""

""Is everyone else?""

""Yes sirs"" 

""You mind if we check?""

""Not at all""

So the officers open the door and heads start popping around corners, officers exchange another look

""Everyone over 21?""

Chorus ""yes""(read no)

Door closes

""Don't have us called out here again""

""Yes sirs""

The officers turn to walk away as we open the door and step back inside as soon as the door closes i start laughing hysterically and yell out ""FUCKING JOUSTING?!?!?!?"" as the rest of the party recommences

Starter set D&amp;D, lovely adventure. A few encounters, kinda lethal. Ended up having 3 'seasons', season 2 and 3 taking place after TPKs. For those who don't know, there's an evil drow who's uncovered a lost mine of magical-ness, and is going to use it for his own nefarious deeds. Never really specified what he's doing there (I mean, it's not like he'll succeed. Right? *Right?*)

Party screws up trying to save a small town from a bunch of ruffians (killed by bugbears under Trensador manor); 4 months later, new party has to come in and deal with the fascist regime that's come into place over this town. Ruffians are now organised, orcs and necromancer from nearby caves united under this one evil rule. 

Liberating goes well, before they receive a plea of help from a druid, who helped ship all of the children out of the town with the help of a cleric in town, who got a vision from her god of the oncoming tide of evil orcs and thugs who'd love to kill the kids or keep them hostage. Day of encounters, deal is made with a dragon, long/short rest not done, run through a forest BANG wolves, surrounded, eaten. 

3 months later, the war that should've never happened is on the horizon. Black Spider succeeded in turning the town into army of stone zombie/gargoyle/elemental minions, party gets assigned task of killing strategically important leaders before the battle commences. Most die in Cragmaw castle, run away with tails between legs, meet stonified old party members, run away some more, meet hobgoblins, one thing leads to another, party kills each other, bar two (the two who hated each other the most, pacifist and a double homicide criminal, go figure).

They reach Neverwinter, and they act as poster boys for the battle. I get to use the mass combat rules for 5e D&amp;D (unearthed arcana is cool) as they lead the charge, black spider gets killed along with Venomfang, Neverwinter army suffers 80% casualties.

Alongside that the germanic (Jutes/Anglos/Saxon) movements are contested (e.g. the older 'invasion and total tribal movement' has been replaced with more a 'the elites move over and slowly move the population across'.

To return to OP's point: Yes, the movement is somewhat accurate, if over done for gameplay purposes.","1441065905"

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt;The particular fight of women against capitalism has its own unique character, but is also critical within the wider class struggle.

The particular fight of men against capitalism has its own unique character, but is also critical within the wider class struggle. How would you feel about ""masculinists"" and MRAs hijacking socialist (and atheist and progressive and scientific) thought and proclaiming ad nauseam ""THINK ABOUT DE MENZ"" while shaming and silencing anyone who tries to look at the issue holistically and without gender goggles? Wouldn't you think that's absurd? 

You're not addressing my point. Is there **anything** in this society that makes women struggle more than men to justify this obsessive focus on women's issues in every field of political discourse? If there is, you'd be right to call for feminism as a critical part of socialist thought. But you have not provided a single real life example of specifically female struggle caused by specifically female discrimination.

I say it's not harder for women to succeed in this capitalistic pesudo-meritocratic society than men. It's not a gender issue and thus there is nothing that warrants injecting feminist ""thought"" into socialist discourse. It's irrelevant and distracts from the core issue in the same way that Atheism+ distracted from skeptic and atheist discourse by endlessly circlejerking (or shlicking?) about women's issues and the supposed sexism in the atheist community. I'm glad that movement died, nothing of value was lost.

&gt;However, the social and economic system itself is a rigid, patriarchal hierarchy

Patriarchy. You keep throwing that word around. It doesn't make the concept any more real.

A true patriarchy would have to employ systemic discrimination and oppression of women to keep them out of positions of power and thus uphold exclusively or predominantly male rule. Such a system does not exist in current times. Women have the same opportunity (or lack of opportunity) to climb the corporate ladder as men. Are female CEOs, political representatives or presidents considered ""matriarchs""? Would we have to speak of a matriarchy if &gt;50% of all positions of power were held by women? Women make up the majority of child care workers, is child care a matriarchy keeping men out?

Equality of opportunity is not patriarchal, it's not sexist, racist or otherwise discriminatory. It's a fully leveled playing field, at least in the social realm, a true meritocracy can't exist without it. Can you prove with strong evidence that there exists an inequality of opportunity specifically affecting the women in our society as the cause for the relative lack thereof in positions of power?

&gt;Women have many opportunities to 'act like men' (read: be similarly exploited or exploitative)

Are you saying that being exploitative is a masculine trait? What a blatantly sexist and misandrist notion.

&gt;Engel's was writing about this in the 1880s.

Fair enough. I don't know how far back this notion goes. So feminist and socialist thought have intersected since the early days. Doesn't change anything about the necessity for such a link, especially today after the massive social change for women and the abolition of all discriminatory laws (except some that discriminate against men).

&gt; it's about the social relations involved in property and production.

How does this relate to social relations between the sexes? How do these relations constitute sexism and discrimination on a wide scale? Only if they do can you speak of a patriarchy. You're speaking of patriarchal structures without explaining them or giving any sort of empirical evidence for their existence.

Also idk why you're being downvoted, I realize a lot of people on this subreddit will disagree with you, but I think it's lazy to just downvote a somewhat coherent argument without even making a rebuttal. That's just the kind of silencing tactic we're fighting against.","1441065907"

"amateur_boxing","t5_2ss7o","&gt; compared to hitting the bag or shadow boxing my power is nowhere near what I normally output when I'm actually sparring.

Completely normal. Static target that doesn't hit back vs. moving object that does hit you back.

&gt; Also, how do you get used to getting hit?

By getting hit some more.

&gt; I find myself being able to take the hits but I just turn my face away and wait for a moment when my opponent stops striking, then I retaliate. I think it may just be the alien feeling of getting my head knocked back but idk.

Getting hit for anyone isn't natural. Your body will go through some emotions from it, ranging to getting angry and ""why would he hit me?!"". Completely normal.

&gt; How can I improve my power and movement when sparring without actually sparring with someone?

Focus on hip movement on the bag, snap your punches.. Too many people ""push"" their punches, when they do so in sparring, they end up losing balance as you land maybe 5-10% of punches you throw.

But IF I wanted lunch at 1pm, or just had to leave the office at that time, it was often impossible. People who wanted to get to the ground floor would get on the elevator when it still was going up, because everyone else did that, making the elevator full by the time it was going down.

For a hero like DP she doesn't care a huge amount about the stacks because with even base bloodstone she can spam spells pretty well. Heroes like Storm or Lesh, however, become much stronger with more bloodstone stacks and if they get a few early game kills it can make them much much stronger than other heroes can get for the same item cost. Compare a storm without bloodstone to a storm with a bloodstone and the difference fairly noticeable later in the game (unless he gets shutdown hard and loses his stacks, but that is very difficult to do as we have even seen in pro games).

The base stats of bloodstone are fine, it's the potentially huge amounts of late game mana regen that makes certain heroes too strong late. I wouldn't mind it being made a more consistent item, maybe with min/max charges, though I fear that would reduce the items uniqueness too much.","1441065910"

Right before she runs into the principal, she overhears noises on the intercom and that signals to her she needs to get out of the building. Yet, she runs into the principal, who is making very similar noises, and tries to talk to him even though she knows it won't work.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","a two week notice to vacate doesn't actually put her on the street in two weeks. in practice, she'll have several weeks longer. **don't panic, in large, friendly letters.**

once the notice expires, if she refuses to leave, the LL will have to file an eviction suit in the justice of the peace court that covers the complex. you can figure out which one by looking at a map on the county's website. (corpus is in four different counties, so you need to know which county you're in.)

there will be a hearing before the JP where the LL asks the JP to order her to vacate. at that time, she has the right to protest and explain why she should not be evicted.

her reasons why she should not be evicted may include:

* the rent is current and fully paid (make certain this is true!)
* she has not violated any other terms of the lease
* the notice to vacate was defective (see below)
* the house is not uninhabitable, save for the timely repairs refused by the landlord

even if the JP rules against her and orders her out, she will still have another 72 hours before the LL can bring the county constable to put her belongings on the street.

**defective notice:** texas law is very specific about how notice to vacate must be delivered, and any deficiency in the delivery of the notice can cause the JP to throw the eviction suit out and make the landlord start again. the notice:

* must be sent by certified RRQ or registered mail, or hand delivered, or posted on the inside front/main door of the dwelling. posting the notice on the *outside* of the front door is *not* sufficient and *is* defective.
* must be within the law, or the time limit specified in the lease.
* a notice to vacate for non-payment of rent must be made delivered at least 72 hours prior to the date and time of the expected move-out
* in general, all other types of notice to vacate, including termination of the lease for any cause except non-payment of the rent, must be made with at least 30 days notice, *except* if the lease specifies otherwise.

&gt; Today the leasing agent told her that she has 2 weeks to move out.

an oral instruction is **not** a valid notice to vacate. if it didn't come on paper as above, it didn't happen.

as a general rule, justices of the peace will not allow a notice that was previously found to be defective to stand for the refiling of a case. for example, if she is given a defective notice to move out, and the JP rules that it was defective, then the whole process must start over again, with a brand new, properly-delivered notice, and the entire timer is reset from zero. ""well, i told her two weeks ago with that other notice"" is not an acceptable shortcut.

the tenant may demand that the landlord repair the issue by properly delivering, in writing, a notification. if the landlord fails to make ""reasonable"" (see below) efforts to do so after being notified in writing, the tenant may herself file suit in JP court to force the landlord to repair the property, to recover damages, to end the lease, or some combination of the above.

the tenant *may not* pay for the repair and deduct it from the rent without either a written agreement from the landlord to do so, or without an order from the court. if the landlord fails to repair after proper notice, the tenant may file suit and seek permission to pay for the repair directly and deduct the cost from the rent. however ... **the rent must be current.** the law does not entertain the pay-and-deduct remedy if the rent is not current.

**definition of ""reasonable:""** texas law presumes that a seven day repair window, after notification, is reasonable. however, in court, the LL may rebut this presumption, if a longer period would actually be reasonable. for example, if the roof is blown off in a tornado, it may reasonably take longer than seven days to repair the damage.

That loan involved a purchase option but also an option to buy, so perhaps Man U first has the option to pay BVB, say, €10 mil to get Januzaj back, and if they don't choose to pay that, BVB can pay, say, €15 mil to keep him. In that case if both sides declined he would return to Man U.

It would be a plus for both sides because if he plays well BVB would either get what amounts to a loan fee or they'd get the option to purchase him.","1441065915"

Hopefully it has built your confidence as well as your capabilities. I'm extremely impressed by what you've created for us, and I'm glad that I got to be part of your journey. Whatever the outcome of the voting, you've already won by making it this far, and I mean that fully. You each bring something unique to the table, and you're all fabulously talented, and it's anyone's game.

A) I'm sticking to hyperextensions/back extensions for glute and hamstring work since they don't involve knee action. Are there any quad exercises that don't heavily strain the knees or am I out of luck?

So it's a lot less than a 9-5 job if you're not that popular. I mean, i only have 8K followers now, i gave it up to pursue an actual full time job cos the game was getting boring to me.

For someone who has around 40K followers, 500+ subs, etc, you're looking at more than average 9-5 jobs, just for playing a video game. It'll sound dumb me saying it, but it is a difficult job to stick to, no matter how much you love one game, playing it and streaming it consistently every day will burn you out eventually. Personally i just don't think it's worth it unless you somehow get insane viewer growth and then you can turn it into a full time career, which is quite rare.","1441065919"

There is only one point so it is centered. The sight housing moves but my problem is the elevation adjustment(not the yardage) is maxed out. The slider for yardage will hit the cable rod if I lower the sight on the riser, so it's either a spacer so I can use the upper sight holes and lower it on the riser, or use the slider to get the last bit of adjustment(not as ideal).","1441065919"

When my old ex and I were breaking up, she was 26, living at home, having just killed our relationship of 2-3 years by getting way too close to her ex. Sure she had a good job and an MBA, but in reality she was a loser. She was a woman about to turn 27, with no real prospects for a quality man beyond her orbiters. She had to start over and wade through the guys that just want to fuck her and hope she can keep one.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Guy was offering to go on walks and watch films etc. but it was OP who kept rejecting it because all she wanted to do was work, and was blaming her boyfriend for the problems. OP claims that it was his anxiety that caused the problems but it sounds like she's a hell of a lot more anxious than he is. She can't even take the time to enjoy herself with her boyfriend. Everyone keeps talking about how her boyfriend needed to change but it's not like OP has done anything to change. I think the reason she couldn't get turned on by him anymore is because everytime she saw him she thought about their socio-economic status and couldn't get her mind off that. He was ready to meet you somewhere in the middle but I don't think OP just wanted that, I think she expected him to change at some point and go into a cushy nine to five so she could have her dream house, dream kids etc. 

I think the guy would be better off with someone else who doesn't feel constantly pressured to have a higher socio-economic status, under the guise of wanting 'equality'.  

OP, whatever, do what you want to do, honestly this relationship was probably a bad idea but guys like him are loving people and would stay with you even if you weren't right for him. You rejected time with him in favour of working towards getting to buy shoes. He was clearly happy to just spend time with you without spending money whereas you weren't. So really, either you don't really love him, or you do and you really need to reconsider your priorities. Honestly, there are so many things that you can do for free or for very little money and it sounds like he was trying to push for that but you kept rejecting him. 

I'm not even saying you were wrong for breaking up with him, you guys aren't compatible. I'm just saying that this was some weak shit. ","1441065920"

It's the same with medical marijuana. Homeopathy, chiropractic, the vaccine-autism link, and all kinds of alternative therapies are (rightfully, IMO) criticized for being based on anecdotal evidence without the clinical trials to back them up. But medicinal marijuana? Oh, they will share all of their anecdotes about how it really helped with some condition or another.

I'm all for legalization for recreational use, but I don't like the medicinal effort as a loophole for it. If it's legal for to treat a certain medical condition, it should go through the same clinical trials as any other drug, and be held to the same strict manufacturing controls.

In all walks of life, someone is going to do something corrupt at the top.  No one gets to the top without gaining an advantage somewhere.  Whether it be using a broken build combo, using XP boost in multiplayer, or just playing longer hours than most normal FT workers.

Lance Armstrong was blood infusing, Barry Bonds did Roids, Marion Jone was on roids, and wrestling is fake.  Hell, even Mayweather gives more hugs out than Barney the dinosaur...

Some you might consider cheats, some exploits, some, part of the game.  Bottom line is, if there's an advantage, someone is bound to take it.  You either join them in the pursuit, or you play it your way, and then tell people your results while saying you don't bot.

[This](http://walmerconvenience.com/2015/08/31/the-real-reason-why-we-are-your-friends-flopped/) has a really interesting perspective that I kind of agree with. EDM is dead. Anyone in the scene will tell you that. It's been around long enough that the people who really love electronic music have moved on to their respective genres (trance, house, trap, etc.) and those who still listen to the ""EDM"" DJ's do so to party. It's never been about the DJ's... it's always been about the musical journey and the vibes and the party atmosphere. Even if you're an uninteresting sheep that's just there to do molly and dance the night away, you go to these events to party and have a good time. These reasons don't translate into a movie*.

*: A movie actually about the scene is different; for example, Under the Electric Sky is a movie about people's journey's at EDC. This does translate well because they're real people that were actually there. I mean really it's not even a fictional movie, it's more a documentary.

I dunno, I haven't really molded this train of thought into a coherent argument but I hope you kind of understand where I'm coming from.

And the 128 BPM being the Holy Grail of electronic music really, *really* alienated a lot of people. The trailer was negatively received by most electronic music enthusiasts.","1441065923"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In my experience:

You don't care. But worse than that no one else cares, well that's how you *feel* anyway, so you care even less. You don't care about how you look, hygiene goes out the window, I want to sleep all the time yet I can't sleep at all, and I'm so unhappy. I hate myself, everything I do is wrong, no one will love someone like me. I look in the mirror and see the monster that lives inside me.  Death is preferable to this, no one will miss me anyway. I spend days feeling like a zombie, just going through life on autopilot. Every interaction seems forced, every smile fake, and every laugh a ghost of its former self. You've become a hermit, afraid to even go to the store. You make excuses as to why you can't make a function, you become agitated over minor slights and perceived insults. Your anxiety overrides every emotion with an unhealthy undercurrent of misery.  You stew in your unhappiness like some emo kid stumbling upon death metal in a back alley bar. You pray for death but   won't act on it. It's too selfish. Then comes the anger in bursts, lightening fast. Then silence, for days. You don't know what's wrong with you or  if anything is wrong. I'm tired. I'm fine. Leave me alone. No one gets it. You will never understand. No one cares anyway. These thoughts, over and over, constantly, make you want to kill yourself.

Hope, medication. Months, even years, to find the right dosage, the right combination. You suffer the side effects, weight gain, weight lose, loose your hair and sex drive, head aches, dizziness, the works, you keep going.  The meds work, you are alive. Therapy, CBT, hope. I am still alive.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1 nonpsychotic about 3 years ago after 2 years misdiagnosis and being on the wrong medication, which made my illness worse. I am now well managed, healthy, and happy.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I had both bottom wisdom teeth taken out over 2 procedures 6 months apart. Even though both teeth were impacted and one of them had an infection behind it, both the surgeries and recoveries were uneventful.

Just ensure that you follow the dentists orders and you'll be fine.

Don't do what I did and spend hours after hours researching horrible complications of wisdom tooth removal, it's not going to happen if you don't let it and if it does occur, it's out of your control. So just sit back, relax and let the healing occur.

I didn't need anything stronger than Ibuprofen to completely negate the pain, so that was fine. The one thing which frustrated me was that 2 Ibuprofen tablets last around 4 hours and the recommended daily dosage states that you should only take 6 tablets a day. 

Which means if you wake up, take 2 tablets, that lasts till midday. You take another 2, that lasts till 4pm. Then you take another 2 which lasts till 8pm. Now you've hit your daily limit and the pain is back when you're trying to get to sleep.

I spoke to my doctor and he told me that I could probably handle the extra set of tablets each day assuming that I don't do it for months on end. But as an alternative, he recommended trying to weave acetaminophen into my daily regiment as it's easier on your kidneys than Ibuprofen. 

So in short, it honestly isn't as bad as some complain about. Please do remember that the older you get, the harder it is getting them removed. So see your dentist!","1441065925"

In my understanding of how TV and movies work, almost everyone is part of a union or guild, and there are set rates for how much they have to get paid. Actors, writers, camera operators, editors, whatever, they all have a pay scale. A lot of these pay scales are quite high, because these are the types of jobs where it's hard to get 52 weeks of steady work a year. There are some non-guild productions, where people are paid less, but I think most shows you see on major networks like MTV are made by guild members.","1441065930"

You can layer in an explosion, a cannon, a bolt of lightning, and even certain animal sounds like a gorilla or lion to add some flavor.

On a more serious note do not actually ask them that but, you could ask them where they see growth in the legal profession or would they do it all over again now if they had the chance. These questions aren't particular to the legal profession but, they might give you some guidance.

Just throwing my two cents into the hat here, I think there are different qualities and traits that make different lawyers in different fields great.

"Indiemakeupandmore","t5_2w8pb","Indie is a relatively new concept for cosmetics and fragrances.  Not that there weren't small businesses popping up since probably always, it's just that we used to call them artisanal, niche, or boutique.  For example, I notice in the wet shaving communities, they refer to small-batch soaperies as *artisan*, not indie, so clearly some groups retain their own set of vocabulary.  The term indie - as an abbrev. for independent as well as the idea of challenging pop culture trends by producing something experimental - basically only applied to music and sometimes film.  I think there's some bleed-over with applying it to other industries, that expectation of deliberate, thoughtful *difference* even though IMO a lot of indies are really invested in capitalizing on trends.  I notice we don't comfortably talk about indie clothing or indie shoes or indie woodwork/metalwork or indie art -- yet.

For me, my definition for indie isn't rigid.  They must be independently owned and their business cannot be built on private label.  I'm comfortable if they have less than 10 people involved and they don't need to be entirely hand-made because machines can be a godsend.  Accessibility is limited in some way, usually by production output because they aren't repeatedly listing 200 jars/tubes/bottles on their site as well as supplying 200 more bottles/etc. to retailers.

Basically, for me the crucial distinction is: if the owner gets sick, how much does it affect production and new products?  Are they still so integral to their business that their company would struggle or even close without them?  Would we, as customers, realize that's why the business no longer produces anything new?

Like I said, though, those aren't hard limits.  Sweet Anthem is stocked by Anthropologie, but she is involved in her blending and shipping, and when she went on maternity leave, SA shut down completely: definitely still a small business.  But I am pretty sure Dorian has gotten sick before, yet Fyrinnae still managed because they have a small team, and I still consider them a small business.  Opus Oils has two storefronts, one in LA and one in France, but I still consider her indie.

But I remember when we talked about these businesses as niche and artisans, so to me, they are synonymous.  Mentally, I think I just divided niche into lower-end and higher-end, with indies being on the lower end, not because their quality is bad or they're cheap, but because of ... I don't know, broader recognition?  Respectability?  I just need some way to distinguish between, say, Slumberhouse and ZOMG Smells or Sugarpill and Shiro.  [Random examples; I didn't want to pick anyone who participates here.]  That CaFleureBon article on SS gave her street cred, so it's bumped her up a bit.

Regardless of what I think, there is a definite *type* of business that only gets talked about here at IMAM.  I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about, say, Ineke or MIKMOI here.  I just hope it doesn't make us focus too heavily on the same 5-10 brands of any given type of makeup/bodycare/fragrance until we get bored.  The beauty&amp;fragrance small-scale industry is more diverse than IMAM makes it out to be.","1441065937"

 * Hurricane Sandy victims get short changed by insurers
 * Build it back program steps in to cover the amount Sandy victims are short changed.
 * As seems to usually be the case, this is an obtuse process that takes far too long and involves far too much red tape, but it's mostly in the rear view mirror at this point.
 * Sandy victims now have a chance to recover the money they were short changed from their insurers, but would have to pay back the money build it back essentially fronted them.


The gist of the article seems to be that they should essentially get paid twice for the same amount they were short changed.  Once by the build it back program, and again by their insurers.  Why should they get paid this money twice?  

The article complains about there being more red tape, but if they don't want red tape, it seems they could just not reopen their flood insurance claim and be happy with the build it back money.","1441065938"

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","Years ago, when I performed a full time, non paid Internship for a Republican Congressman, I made the local VA Hospital the topic of my special semester project.

This was even before Operation Desert Storm.

Even at that time, Veterans (WWII, Korean and Vietnam Vets) had outrageous waiting times in order to have their needs taken care of. I interviewed Doctors, Administrators, in-bed patients and guys waiting in the waiting rooms for a long, long time. Everybody agreed that there simply was not enough funding for staff, supplies and facilities.

I reported this grave and apparently systematic problem to my boss &amp; I am not sure what, if anything was done about it after I left.  (I got an A+ for the semester, though)  After our growing involvement in worldwide combat scenarios since then, it is clear to me that this systemic deficiency has not adequately been dealt with either then or now.

I am also former Army Reserve &amp; although I never saw time in a combat theater, I care a great deal about such issues.

As far as the immigrants go, they have a much vaster system of civilian resources, rather than the Veteran Administration's comparatively limited resources, therefore I consider Trump's statement to hold some truth... but not necessarily in the way that he would like us to believe.","1441065939"

Also, as far as general tools go, a phillips head screwdriver, flat head screw driver, hammer, measuring tape, adjustable wrench, pliers of various shapes and sizes, flashlight, and basic socket wrench set should be good enough for regular household maintenance.

"Circleof5","t5_34igk","An interval is basically the ""distance"" between two notes. So if you start on the note C and go to the note D, that would be an interval. 

To make it more simple, if you look at your guitar, when a play a note on the E bass string and then play the note directly beneath that note on the A string, that is the interval of a 4th, aka ""Perfect 4th"".

And if you played a note on the A string and then played the note directly beneath that, you would be playing a 4th again.

So the guitar is full of these little repeating interval patterns. But its not all easy, the patterns are the same sometime between some strings but then they mix up between other strings.

When I gave you those 5 Pentatonic shapes to memorize, all of those patterns could be looked at as different intervals. The beautiful thing about music is how many different ways there are to *think* about what you are playing. 

So I have all of those shapes memorized and can ""see them"" visually, but I can also think about them in terms of ""the intervals"". Two different ways to reach the same goal.

I personally believe the first way is the best way to start, kind of like how learning to read tab is easier than learning to read sheet music. But once again, knowing both is going to help you advance as a player.

The best interval to start with is the octave. [Here is a little page with the many ways to find them.](http://eatsleepguitar.com/2014/03/28/learning-your-octaves/)

An octave is playing from one C to the next C. So its essentially finding the same note in a different place on your guitar by using the first note as a reference.","1441065940"

"Skyforge","t5_2ymb9","That's a respectable decision. I shouldn't have called the community managers out for it; that wasn't my intent. It's this particular information I am really hoping to hear good news about from the Russian developers.

My pantheon knows I read Reddit and get information from the RU devs via nice Russian players like Wyck, so I'm constantly asked about these two particular issues (Anomaly Zones and group-scaling). Group-scaling not working correctly makes group content very difficult to engage and, as I'm sure you know, Anomaly Zones are disliked because the design failed somewhere. . .  whatever they were meant to be, what they turned out has us grinding trash mobs for hours without any fun epic boss fights like the other content contains and grouping is a pain because the quests are for specific areas and there isn't an LFG tool because it is an open zone. . .  an open zone with only group content like those really old MMOs from the late 90s and early 00s. Finally, once you get past the first quest, players must have raided often enough to get their Tactical Sense high enough that they can damage the mobs so there is yet another barrier to finding a group that can be successful. I think they wanted to make something fun here, but the systems all combine to make Anomaly Zones really unpalatable.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","I'm a bit of a thumb on this matter, but I'll give it my best shot.

My experience in Latin comes mainly from learning in high school, where I loved it, but I haven't done much to maintain it since then.  Greek, however, I am a native speaker of the modern demotic (as opposed to Kypriot or Calabrian), which helps a good deal because we like to hold onto very old phrases and words.  Older varieties of Greek definitely have a stronger influence on Demotic because of how long Katharevousa remained the national language, and remains in use by some bodies.  That said, I realy have no formal study in Koine Greek,  but can get through with occasional dictionary use and references to grammar.  Greek spelling has preserved a decent amount at the cost of being about as complex as French spelling.

Learning to read Greek is pretty easy.  Spelling is the tough part for most learners.  Koine does have the added usage of different tones, and I think that can throw some folks off, but over all, the spelling and reading is not too hard.

As for how to start out, I'm a proponent of giving no qualms to early mistakes and just jumping in.  I've done this with Mandarin, buying simple books that I knew were above my head.  Give a shot, come back after a little more study, and go to groups on reddit or the internet for gut checks.  It works pretty well.

Finally, even though I was native to Demotic Greek, I did notice studying Latin help my grammar and writing in both English and Greek.  It's tough to explain, but learning Latin from the ground up forced me to see details of the grammar, so I could see organically how case works and how to use various verb conjugations for stylistic reasons, though Greek still has tweaks unique to it.

One thing that helped me informally with Koine Greek is that my Pappou had a small book for the Divine Liturgy ( he was Orthodox ) that I read through a little.  having some of the readings really helped me put things together and also having similar prayers really let things sink in well!(I fell in love with the Trisagion!)","1441065945"

"Spanish","t5_2qtt1","Here are my suggestions:

Your assignments states this: "" interview 1 friend about where they GO and where they ARE on certain days. Be sure to ask at least 5 total questions using estar, ir, al, a la""

So, they specifically tell you to talk about where your friend GOES, and and where he (or they) ARE. So make sure you use those verbs.

IR for (to go)  and Estar (to be), and maybe, Ser (to be) on certain cases.

The assignment also says: ""Be sure to ask at least 5 total questions using estar, ir, al, a la"" 

So, ""al, a la"" will usually be used with ""ir"" (to go)

Therefore, think of questions you could ask to a few friends (including and conjugating, what your teacher requested) such as...

1- 
ENG: Where do you usually go on Saturday afternoons?
SP: ¿Adónde VAS usualmente los sábados por la tarde?

2- 
ENG: Have you ever gone to the Library on Sundays?
SP: Has IDO A LA biblioteca en domingo? 

This should give you a few ideas,

I'm a native speaker, so I can help.
Got any questions?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A clean, functioning, non smelly bathroom. You never think about how much you love your toilet at home until you have a horrible stomach ache and there's either no bathroom at all, or the only one available is disgusting, smelly, and slightly broken. Made even worse with no toilet paper.

I also have a story to go along with this. I was helping ref a soccer game, when my friend said he was hungry. Thankfully there was a Subway across the street, so in between games we went over and grabbed some footlongs. For some reason, any time I eat Subway, I will get horrible diarrhea, however it usually isn't for 3-5 hours. It was the cheapest and fastest food, so I had to eat it unfortunately. 30 minutes later, I felt a movement deep within my bowels. I get frequent stomach aches, so I am very good at deciding how long I have to make it to a toilet. I estimated 3 minutes tops. About 50 meters from the field we were on was a small bathroom, which was essentially a glorified port-o-potty, with no lights, a permanent hole in the ground with a small plastic seat, and some .5 ply toilet paper. I knew I wouldn't make it across the street to the closest real bathroom, so I had to settle. There was already so much feces in the toilet that it was nearly touching my butt, which was hovering above the piss-covered toilet seat. 

It was then that the diarrhea came.

After a good splatter of Subway, I estimate 3 inches, I felt the sudden courage to head across the street to a nearby Mexican restaurant, which I prayed had a nice bathroom. I wiped my butt, and started to speed walk across the fields and across the street, with my goal only meters ahead. I felt a surge of relief as I walked through the doors, asked the waitress if I could use their restroom, and ventured in.

It was glorious. Nice and air conditioned, multiple stalls, spotless toilets, and beautiful 2 ply toilet paper. I had never been more grateful to see a porcelain chair than that time. A short while later, I washed my hands, thanked the waitress, and returned to the soccer fields, feeling like a new man. ","1441065947"

"IronThroneRP","t5_345ny","Edderion was stone faced as his brother Herbert lost his tilt, though pride burned in his chest for how well the man had fought. When Theodan tasted earth, however, the King in the North bore a quiet smile.

""I'll not be hearing the end of that for some time, I think."" He said to no one in particular. 

The rest of the matches were the usual bouts of awe and shattered lances. He rose to his feet with much the rest of the crowd when his cousin Edric's lance took the Blackwood particularly hard in the chest, throwing him hard into the dirt. Attendents swarmed out to bring him to the maester's tent, but by the end of the next match, he was dead.

*Bad business, that.* The King thought. *I'll have to talk to the Blackwoods, give them my condolences...and try to distance them from the Royces for a little while to come, no doubt.* Part of him wondered if he had just witnessed the beginning of a Royce-Blackwood feud, to mirror that of the Blackwood-Bracken one. It was an amusing thought at first, but when he thought of all the death and madness those two warring houses had caused, he sobered quickly.

""That was a good round."" Edderion told the party assembled behind him. ""Lord Tarly earns his fame even to this day. And young Robin seems set to claw out glories of his own. Your cousin, Lady Westerling, acquits himself well. I look forward to seeing what the next round brings.""

For whatever reason, it just happens to last for 4-6 hours depending on how much was taken and whether or not a second dose was consumed. You can try taking a third or fourth, but by then our bodies have already gotten rid of all of the excess serotonin and done everything it needs to do to bring back homeostasis. Maybe others will have had different experiences, but in my experience, a third redose only extends the ""magic"" of the peak for another hour or so and then makes me feel speedy and slightly dysphoric. I've tried it three times when I was stupider and nothing positive ever came out of it. I would have been better just coming down and riding out the rest of the night in a nice afterglow.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I just think it's absurd to have tiered pre-orders and not even give people all the unlocked tiers. Its a scabby system as it is before you only give each person one. 

Although he mentioned about console refunds. Here in Australia, any dedicated game retailer, but for the purpose of this example, EB Games, will give a refund if you return the game soon after buying it. They say a week, but usually will only take it if you return it a reasonable amount of time. Like, the next day or the same day, maybe two days. They refuse you if you keep doing it to abuse the system tho. 

Furthermore with console pre-orders. Pre-orders I think have to be kept available for pick up 3 days or I think a week from release date of the game. As long as you have not picked up the pre-order, they will always immediately refund you if you ask, even if its a 300 dollar collectors edition. It's basically impossible to get screwed by them unless you absolutely must have the game on launch, and even then, you still have time to check reviews. This is primarily due to the deposit system they use, where you only have to put in 10 bucks to get a pre-order of a game. (or 50 for expensive rare collectors editions) They cant force you to pay, and because of this, gain very little from not allowing on release refunds. If you refuse your collectors edition, they just sell it in the corner. There was a Dragon Age Inquisition loot chest collectors edition on sale for like 8 months after release date before they presumably just threw the thing out. 

Also, in terms of exclusive content. Outside about 5 games ever, exclusive content versions will be available for regular purchase for weeks with highly popular games and months (if not years) with less popular games. I recently picked up a new limited edition copy of Killer is Dead for example for like 20 bucks. The first edition Final Fantasy Type-0 with Episode Duscae copies can still be bought new with the demo inside, and that game sold like hotcakes. 


While in America, where returning games is considered a sin, the Steam refund system may seem great, it simply is still a step behind physical stores in Australia.","1441065950"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","For me (a 41 year old guy), it's because I was a 3 year old boy who saw Star Wars when it first came out in the summer of 1977. The impact that movie had on my childhood, and every kid in my life, all the way thru the mid-1980s, was immense. We loved the films, we played with the toys, we dressed up as the characters for Halloween, at Christmas there was AT LEAST one Star Wars present unwrapped, and there was rarely a day that went by when a reference to the film didn't touch your life. I'm a dad now. My son will be 5 when The Force Awakens comes out; he's seen All of the Star Wars films, and is super hyped. I am gonna get to do it all over again. It is going to be so much fun.  It's just one of those things.  If you were there, in the moment, it's very special.","1441065951"

"anime","t5_2qh22","Hi, I do posts about under recommended shows in an effort to widen new anime viewers horizons beyond the usual symphony of clannad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other popular mainstream shows. There is a lot of anime out there, so I hope these posts enable viewers to discover shows they enjoy that they normally would not have had on their radar.

As dictated by [this](http://strawpoll.me/5300087/r) poll, I will be covering horror shows this week, not a lot of them out there and not all of them good. One of the weaker genres in anime, although Japanese cinema does it well. I did not have a lot of time to write this, so please excuse errors and the shorter summaries/pitches.

Old posts:

* **[Wide appeal, under rec](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3fonsl/recommendation_tuesdays_week_of_august_04_2015/ctqisx5)** - Gin no Saji, Big O, Gundam
* **[Shows I consider great, but not seen enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3gj1dj/recommendation_tuesdays_week_of_august_11_2015/ctykvqk)** - Junketsu no Maria, Sakamichi no Apollon, Uchouten Kazoku, and the PreCure Series

* **[Under-recommended Drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3i9of7/recommendation_tuesdays_week_of_august_25_2015/cuei92v)** - Tsumiki no Ie, Furiko, Nana, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Planetes, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Aoi Bungaku Series


***So here are some horror shows***.

There will be two sections; what is classified as horror traditionally and what is very unsettling in tone. Most traditional horror anime just arent scary, sometimes they are even laughable, which is why some other genres do horror better than horror in the anime world.

**Horror Genre (Traditional)**

**[Another](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11111/Another)** - (Horror/Mystery) This anime is essentially final destination. With it comes the same premise of people miraculously dying in strange ways that seem destined from a curse, and these deaths are sometimes very comical because of how elaborate or out of the way they are. The show gave me chuckles, a good share of wincing, and a nice mystery that is actually solvable (although very hard to without knowing all the clues). Not the best thing out there, but for people searching for horror it is worth a watch. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N8kvL5oFjI) is a trailer even though its not very good.

TLDR: Another is a classic horror show with an obvious Hollywood parallel with Final Destination. Not very scary, but the formula is there.


**[Corpse Party](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15037/Corpse_Party:_Tortured_Souls_-_Bougyakusareta_Tamashii_no_Jukyou)** - (Horror) Corpse Party follows students stuck in a school known for murders that is haunted. You can imagine the horrors that happen. Based on a game, the show is only a 4 episode OVA, but it delivers what it needs to in spades. Its got its gore, its spooks, and its horror formula to be a nice addition for this list. [The trailer really says everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weMxaz2KqHk)


TLDR: Haunted school, gore, and spooks, and some hellish alternate dimensions. 4 episodes.

**[Hugurashi Series (When They Cry)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni)** - (Horror) Higurashi is the classic horror series for anime. Towns with secrets, brutal murder, and whodunits all over the place, its a really formulaic interesting mystery horror series with a lot of content. If you had to pick one show from this section, this series is your best bet. [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRnfLvH4yLM)


TLDR: Small town whodunit murders. Large series.


**[Yami Shibai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19383/Yami_Shibai)** - (Horror) What I like to describe as picture book budget horror. A collection of short stories meant to scare, the anime has a limited animation style and a pretty unique artstyle. While not the best thing out there, it does get the job done. The format is nice for some quick horror before bed. No good trailers for such short content, worth the time to watch an episode or two and give it a shot though.


TLDR: Picture-book short-style anime meant to scare. Worth a shot.

**[Shiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki)** - (Horror/Vampire) Fuck modern vampires. They suck, and not in the usual way. Most anime usually goes for the modern vampire approach, but Shiki does it right. This show is my favorite of this section, and is a classic vampire styled story. While the plot is a bit obvious, it still is an engaging and beautiful and atmospheric show. [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6yEzWAd_vg)


TLDR: Classic-styled village versus vampire. Very good, a must watch from this list.

**[Hell Girl](http://myanimelist.net/anime/228/Jigoku_Shoujo)** - (Horror) A spooky website that can only be visited at midnight, where if you post a grudge on the site, hell girl will come and pull the person who wronged you into the inferno. Another classic horror story, although I personally didn't find it scary. If you enjoy the tropes of horror, it is still worth a watch though. This is probably my least favorite show in this section. Hopefully the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo5wuctIMWk) does a better job at selling it than me.

TLDR: Website where you write about people you want to poof away into hell.

**Unsettling Shows that aren't horror, but get the job done**

**[Shinsekai Yori (From The New World)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori)** - (Mystery/Drama/Horror) While not a traditional horror story, Shinsekai Yori is definitely **the best show on this list and the scariest**. Set in a Utopian village far in the future, the show explores a strange and haunting depiction of the future with one of the mot unsettling atmospheres I have seen. Knots would tie in my stomach while watching this show. If you check my list, I never finished it (mostly because I got spoiled on the ending) but DO NOT BE LIKE ME. Watch this show. It is based of an award winning [Japanese novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_New_World_%28novel%29)(spoilers in plot description etc.) and it really shows with how well written and good it is. Couple all this with a great soundtrack and great acting, and you have what is pretty much a sleeper classic from the past few years. 

TLDR: Utopian society that is super unsettling and mysterious. Watch this, ***watch this***.

**[Aku no Hana(Flowers of Evil)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16201/Aku_no_Hana)** - (Psychological Romance?) The manga is better, if you don't mind reading, read it. The anime is rotoscoped and will be hit or miss on you liking or tolerating it. Personally I hate the style. No trailer will sell this show, but the [ED music might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok5yDYrO0gc). The show does creepy and unnerving perfectly, I just wish the animation was better/different. And yes, that is actually the ED. No needed second season appears to be coming, so the story may feel incomplete.

TLDR: Creepy people being psycho-fucks without being too psychotic. Manga is better. 



As is tradition now...

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The importance for China of this coming Thursday’s parade celebrating the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII in the Asia-Pacific cannot be overstated enough.

The Japanese surrender was formally signed on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2.

Yet in China, the key date was actually September 9 in Nanjing at 9am. As this China Daily piece stresses, Beijing’s choice for 9-9-9 was immensely symbolic, as the words ‘nine’ and ‘enduring’, in Mandarin, sound practically the same.

And to think that China at the time was led by nationalist Chiang Kai-shek, comprehensively defeated four years later by the Communists. The initial impulse of China’s leadership was focused on counterpunching aggression with generosity and reconciliation.

From the start, it would be an extremely steep mountain to climb. Here is a detailed portrait of how the war trauma lingered in Hong Kong.

The parade rolling past Tiananmen Square officially celebrates the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. This is an extremely serious – and sensitive – business for 1.4 billion Chinese and the Chinese diaspora all across the world.

And once again, the West - displaying trademark cultural/historical insensitivity - has blown it. Beijing is carefully scrutinizing the diplomatic ramifications of shows and no-shows. Symbolically, absences speak volumes.

President Vladimir Putin will be in Beijing, as well as leaders of the four Central Asian ‘stans’ that are part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). South Korean President Park Geun-hye, South African President Jacob Zuma and Pakistan’s President Mamnoon Hussain will also be present.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan won’t (he was officially invited, and declined). The US, Germany and Canada will send only embassy functionaries. France and Italy at least will send their foreign ministers. The only head of state or government from the all-sorts-of-plague-ravaged EU will be Czech President Milos Zeman.

Whatever the spin, the fact is the US State Department proverbially resorted to mob tactics pressuring South Korean Geun-hye not to go.

The bottom line: neither the US nor the EU – the once hegemonic West – along with Japan, are sending their top political leaders.

And that highlights yet another graphic sign of the strength of the Russia-China strategic partnership. And coming right after the Russian and Chinese navies completed a nine-day joint exercise – their fifth since 2005 - in Peter the Great Gulf, waters off the Clerk Cape and the Sea of Japan.

Significantly Aleksandr Fedotenkov, deputy commander of the Russian navy and also the Russian director of the drill, said both navies aim at keeping the world’s seas “safe and stable.” It’s easy to picture waves of paranoia engulfing US Navy planners as they registered the message. The diplomatic stupidity stakes

The West’s so-called political “elites” are trying hard to exercise a monopoly on diplomatic stupidity. Thus the Tiananmen parade being compared across US corporate media to the recent Red Square parade that celebrated the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany. Not a mention of the over-20 million dead in the Soviet Union and the up-to-20 million Chinese dead during a war that every Chinese person knows very well started in September 1931, when the Japanese invaded Manchuria.

The City of London, via the non-stop downward spiraling the Economist, penned an editorial stressing the parade will “unsettle” China’s neighbors while the country “plays up themes of historical victimhood and the need to correct [them].”

Blaming China for “historical victimhood” is pathetic. Especially because the key aim of the parade, as this Xinhua pieces illustrates, relates to people; to remember the millions of Chinese WWII veterans, “many of whom already perished without due recognition,” and the part they played fighting against fascism in the 1930s and 1940s.

The West does this virtually every year – as if the West alone fought and won against fascism. When Russia or China does it, they are playing ‘victim’. Oh please, go back to boarding school.

Qu Rui, the parade’s chief People’s Liberation Army (PLA) organizer, insists China respects “countries’ choices over whether to come or not.”

That’s fine diplomacy in action. Realpolitik in China though harbors very long memories.

Yes, this is a major turning point for rising China after the much-analyzed “century of humiliation” by foreign powers.

And the mediocre puppets who now “lead” these “foreign powers” seem to be bent on a little more humiliation.

Russia, on the other hand - from the government to a wealth of social organizations – did not forget all of China’s sacrifices in the struggle against fascism. Most Russian analyses center on the need for a unified Russia-China front against a blatant, Western-concocted falsification of what really happened during WWII.

So expect the usual garbage from the usual Western corporate media suspects, insisting this is a horror show, mostly anti-Japanese, designed to boost “nationalistic propaganda” and not interested at all in reconciliation.

The dogs of Western resentment bark and the Chinese military parade passes. On show in Beijing there may be new intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach hypersonic speeds up to over 5-6,000 mph, as well as mid-range missiles for up to 5,000 miles (8046km), apart from a wealth of other military gadgets such as China’s newly unveiled super-drone.

And then it’s back to business, as Chinese planners have already read the geopolitical tea leaves for what they are; NATO plus vassal Japan v Russia/China.

"SarraMinovskyNotes","t5_34isf","""Johann, why are we here?"" A young man in a black suit and tie carefully pushed a shiny wheelchair down a hallway, the sounds of a party echoing from the far end. 

Sitting in the chair was a [beautiful woman](http://i.imgur.com/T2blHe9.png) with long, shiny black hair and glittering green eyes. She wore an elegant red, full-length dress, with gold trim on the cuffs and hem. A white cape draped around her shoulders and down her back, contrasting nicely with the other two colors. However, this lovely sight was marred by the fact that the woman sitting in the chair was pouting like a child.

""Fira, don't ask me that. Your dad was the one who asked you to come, remember? I'm just here as your date.""

""I know, I just really don't want to be here...""

""Look, if you really want to, we can just schmooze a bit, grab some food, and leave.""

""That's not going to work. This is my first public appearance since I woke up. I'm probably going to be sought out by people who want to either gawk or better relations with the Ellias family.""

""Well, I can't blame them. I'd want to come up and talk to you if I found you at a party. You look great.""

Fira smiled, blushing slightly. ""I wouldn't be surprised if people wanted to talk to you, too. Former American national champion is still a pretty good level of achievement."" Fira readjusted her legs with her hands, pushing the non-functional limbs back to the center of the footrest. ""Well, at least there's something convenient about this wheelchair.""

Johann raised his eyebrow. ""Is that why the chair is rattling so much? How many did you hide in there?""

Fira smiled knowingly. ""Well, a girl's got to have some secrets, no?""

Johann sighed. ""Fira, I know there's a tournament here, but still...""

""Hey, you'll thank me when you have to fix the Argent.""

""You brought tools, too? No wonder the chair's so heavy.""

Fira reached behind her and punched him in the arm. ""You should know better than to comment on a woman's weight.""

""It was a compliment! I was wondering why it weighed even that much!"" 

""Well, I guess I can forgive you, then. Just wheel me over to the punch when we get inside.""

With that, one of the ushers pulled open the door, allowing the couple to enter the ballroom.","1441065954"

Maybe if the other teams that challenges for 3rd looked great in the first two matches I would think differently, but they haven't. Roma is the only team that has looked better in my opinion (they are of course expected to be top 2). Inter has looked poor but mostly thanks to Jovetic and some luck have scraped in two wins in fairly easy matches. Napoli 1 point and looked poor and Lazio 3p and got trashed 4-0 by Chievo. Fiorentina 3p and probably looked a bit better than us but they had a collapse against Torino this round after being up 1-0, which is worrying for them. Torino is a strong team though so the loss isn't that big of a deal, but the way they fell apart is. Juventus I don't really think about because I'm sure they will rise up and be top 2 in the end no problem.","1441065956"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Our success as humans has never been in evolution. We spurn evolution and nature and the innate instincts because they are usually useless to us. Our 'success' has been in the learning and rejection of evolution. We have never been good candidates in the evolutionary arms race.

It can be argued that our intelligence and pattern recognition and prehensile hands in evolution has allowed us to do so. But the reason why we are able to thrive is because of developments in medicine and technology.

Normally naturally a person would get a disease inevitably and die. That would mean that person was genetically weak and it was evolutionary correct for them to die so the ones that didn't would get to pass on their genes.

It could be argued that eventually the diseases would win if there was no medicine involved. We don't reproduce fast enough to combat diseases or 'defects' in a natural way.

Our use of medicine and technology is already skipping and defying evolution. If we did not we would fail as a species far sooner; as we are biologically weaker than most competing animals and subject to diseases.

You could argue that we should execute the weak; but where do you draw the line in the 'weak'? You could say we are all weak. You as a specimen is guaranteed to not be perfect and it could be argued that you should be executed for 'tainting the gene pool'.

We should be encouraging furthering research and efforts to help these fellow imperfect members of our species. They aren't perfect, neither are we. The artificial arbitrary costs in taking care of these people are issues with inflation and overly business incorporated medicine industry. Otherwise, none of us are deserving of the contributions that allow for our success as humans in the modern age.

There are no retards in our society. Glory to Arstotzka.","1441065957"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; They should change it because Democratic voters want more than 4 debates before primary voting starts,    
    
Do they, or is just people who didn't understand how to influence the rules?  The DNC is not a democratic institution.    
    
&gt;  because Democratic voters want to have any debate before primary registrations close to bring in Independents    
    
Do they, the Democrats don't want Independents because they're not Democrats.  Same thing with the Republicans.  Again the DNC is more like a business, it's primary role is ""articulating and promoting the Democratic platform and coordinating party organizational activity.""    
    
&gt; They should change it because it's the least amount of primary debates that the Democratic candidates have had since the 70s.     
    
This will help how?   I recall everyone had debate fatigue back in 2008.    
     
Rather than waste money and end up like the GOP this year (and 2008) with it's constant rotation of circus clowns occupying the podium they capped it.        
    
&gt;  Of course the other candidates didn't have the same amount of access to the DNC rules as Clinton - her 2008 campaign's co-chair is the head of the party.    
    
She lost in 2008 because she didn't follow the rules.  This time she did what any shrewd party player (ala House of Cards) would have done, make sure to rig the rules in her favor.

Sooo yea, the ideology is like cancer, but we can definitely root it out by keeping them unorganized. 

The problem is that it can take as long as 2 decades. When the presidential election race comes around, 1 party will use the war in some way against the other party to gain back control and then pull out just when we're getting close to finishing the terrorists off.

All told, I think you'd be better off using the ATMs over there to get the cash you need on a day-by-day basis. They are ubiquitous (at least where I have been in France/Germany/Italy/Switzerland) and often have lower or non-existent fees (per EU regulations). All their ATMs will have English as an option on the screen. You will be able to get EUR before you even leave the airport.

If you want the peace-of-mind of having a few EUR in your pocket, maybe go to [this guy](http://www.currencyexchangedc.com/) in downtown DC. You'll pay a bit of an exchange markup, but if you limit it to just pocket money, you'll be fine.

So, drivers are ""understandably confused"" that they have to contend with an increase in traffic, and are annoyed by it?

I would suggest they find alternate modes of transportation if they get confused at encountering traffic.

The Sanders/Clinton ideological gap is meaningless compared to who gets elected to congress and in what quantity. That's where the real power lies, outside of declaring wars and appointing Supreme Court justices. As seen during the runup to the ACA, the bully pulpit is totally overrated.

Game I'm asking for : **Dear Esther**


I haven't really been active on this community a lot within the last few months, mostly because I've come to realize my computer isn't nearly good enough to play most games, so I'd rather not request anything. But I saw this and I absolutely had to take part. I've been eyeing Dear Esther for a while now, and I don't see anyone else asking for it, so I would absolutely love to have it.


From what I've heard and seen, its a story based 'walking simulator', but I'll be damned if I don't want to play this walking simulator. I love story based games, and this seems like a really good one. Everyone seems to have something good to say about it. I promise to give this game the play time it deserves, and I've also crosschecked that this will indeed run on my computer.


Thanks!

"makinghiphop","t5_2sqw4","I try keep it as simple as possible or it all gets too much for my head.
I have no specific structure but usually just pick a letter from the alphabet and then number them accordingly, for example if I'm writing a hip hop beat i'll save it as H01. Next time i'm writing a hip hop beat I'll save it as H02 etc. I would usually only go up to about H15 before I change the letter, this seems to make it easier to find things again. 
^^ this method defiantly has its setbacks and I realise its only a matter of time before I need a new method. So now I Just make folders for different projects/genres and sub folders inside them for *Unfinished and *finished tracks and just save my projects into said folders.

I thought it was funny but apparently that's actually very creepy, for pillow talk. Sigh. He was not with me forever, incidentally, though we did last a few years there.

I now sort of regularly attend sex parties, which lend themselves to people having very, uh, silly and relaxed sex, right? One time, a dude called out ""oh Shia"" as he came. Like, Shia Labeouf. We'd been talking about him earlier in the evening, and he ruined his own orgasm for the sake of the joke. Was goddamned hilarious, though the girl was momentarily very not-amused. Their relationship remained adorable in the wake of it, as far as I am aware.","1441065968"

"stevenuniverse","t5_2viyl","I've been giving this a lot of thought since I picked the series back up from ""Marble Madness"" onwards, and there's a lot of evidence to support this idea.

The clues in Rose's Scabbard have already been outlined by the op, but I think there's evidence scattered amongst some other episodes, too.

There are a bunch of clues in ""Do It For Him"", one of the songs in ""Sworn to the Sword"". Here, Pearl is teaching Connie how to sword-fight and, later, that Connie should be solely dedicated to Steven. However, at certain points in the song, Pearl makes references to how she protected Rose in the war. Here are a few quotes that support this:

""You do it for her, that is to say, you'll do it for him,"" where ""her"" is Rose and ""him"" is Steven.

""You have nothing but the way you feel your strategy and a sword,"" Pearl, singing about being in battle, accompanied by a flashback to a battle and Pearl protecting Rose.

""You just think about the life you'll have together after the war,"" which is the biggest hint - Pearl wants to live with Rose after the war.

Later, in ""Story for Steven"", Pearl is jealous of Rose's affections for Greg, and when Rose comments on Greg's music, Pearl says ""I can sing too!"" Pearl is trying to convince Rose she's as good as Greg.

There are similar themes in ""We Need To Talk"". Pearl mocks Greg's inability to fuse with Rose, and later, she is upset by the idea that Rose and Greg have metaphorically fused, when they are talking. I think this is where Pearl finally realises Rose prefers Greg to her.

For all those who don't think gems could be romantically attracted to one another, there's a few good examples in the show already - Garnet (Ruby and Sapphire), and Steven (Rose and Greg) are the two most obvious examples of romance between two gems, as well as gems and humans.

This is far-fetched and almost definitely wrong, but sometimes I get the feeling that Pearl might still resent Greg, and, to some extent, Steven, for taking Rose from her.

I'm sure there's a bunch of other clues and hints to Pearl's affection to Rose that I've missed, too.

tl;dr There's lots of evidence to suggest Pearl was in love with Rose.","1441065970"

No.  Youre looking at $200 to $300 to set up properly and then $10 to fill a canister every couple months.

Cheap stuff isn't worth it. It doesn't work as well. Aquarium supplies you either get good stuff, or do without. The middle of the road stuff will not work as good and will break and then you will upgrade to the good stuff and end up spending way more the you should have.

You can diy co2, but its not as good, its messy, and after a year or two the cost of sugar makes it cost as much as a proper co2 tank would have. Plus having a bottle explode once is just not worth the savings.

"programming","t5_2fwo","That's one possible *model* and implementation of the `IO` type.  Not the only one, and not necessarily the best one.  One more ""machine-like"" alternative would be something like this:

    newtype IO a = IO (Program PrimIO a)

...which isn't the easiest thing to understand, but here:

* `PrimIO` is a type whose values are pointers to foreign C routines that take no arguments and return type `a` (similar but not identical to [`FunPtr`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Foreign-Ptr.html#t:FunPtr));
* `Program` is the [operational monad](http://apfelmus.nfshost.com/articles/operational-monad.html)—the monad that models a program as a **step** that consists of two things:
 * The `PrimIO` to execute next;
 * The *continuation* function that, when applied to the `PrimIO`'s execution result, computes the program's next step.

Then the machine to execute `IO` programs would invoke the `PrimIO` at the `Program`'s head step, pass its result to the embedded continuation function to obtain the next step, and then keep at it.  Expanded to pseudo-code:

    -- The program representation type
    data IO' a where
        Done :: a -&gt; IO' a
        Step :: PrimIO x      -- The next action
             -&gt; (x -&gt; IO' a)  -- The continuation
             -&gt; IO' a

    instance Monad IO' where
        return = Done
        Done a &gt;&gt;= k = k a
        Step prim k &gt;&gt;= k' = Step prim (\x -&gt; k x &gt;&gt;= k')

    -- Metacircular interpreter
    runIO' :: IO' a -&gt; IO a
    runIO' (Done a) = return a

2) don't brake til you land. 
3) there are hips where you turn 90 degrees, but this is not one of them. Those are very vertical. Your probably want about 30-45 degrees of turn, plus a bit of lean on this particular one. That's just off eyeballing the video on my phone though. 
4) you mentioned 'hopping' a few times in the comments...if you hit the lip at the appropriate speed, you won't need to hop for extra air, you can focus on bike positioning instead of worrying about adding air.

"52weeksofcooking","t5_2t4i2","I really enjoy making risotto!  It can be a very impressive dish because many people think that it is difficult to make.  But, it is not!  It only takes a bit of creativity and some (okay, a lot, of patience).

I make all kinds of risottos, depending on what I choose as my menu. In the case if a seafood risotto, it is really a meal in and of itself.  Just add a salad.  I adore a cheese and herb risotto with a veal dish and a vegetable risotto with a beef or chicken dish.

Today I made the seafood risotto.  Prepare separately the seafood that you wish to use.  Make sure that you save the essence and the juices from the preparation to add to the stock that will be used later.  For example, I steamed the shrimp and the squid and saved the steaming liquid.  I sauteed the bay scallops in a bit of ghee and deglazed the pan with a touch of white wine.  Add all of these essences together and add a bit of clam juice.  Mix enough water to make about 4 cups of stock.  Season the stock with pepper (careful if adding salt - oftentimes the stock is already salty enough).  Place the stock in a pan and simmer gently over very low heat.

Add a TBS or two of olive oil to a deep saute pan.  Add aromatics, in this case I added chopped leeks, shallots, and garlic.  Saute until soft.  Add one cup of Arborio rice and saute until the rice is fully covered with the oil.  Add 1/3 cup of wine to deglaze the pan.  Cook off the wine.  Begin adding the warmed stock a  half ladle at a time.  Cook until the liquid has been fully absorbed by the rice.  (When you pull a wooden spoon through the mixture, it should take several seconds for the mixture to reclaim the bottom of the pan.)  Continue this process until a taste of the rice yields an al dente rice bite.  This will take from 35 to 40 minutes.  Right...patience!

When you have the perfect taste of rice, add the herbs...chopped chives, a touch of basil, and parsley.  Incorporate.  Then gently fold in the reserved seafood.  Plate, dress and serve!","1441065974"

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","its really hard to oppose all politics in general, if possible at all, in my opinion. Anyway, how does opposing all politics in general work to you? what does it involve, does it involve just not saying anything about politics or does it involve actively shutting out politics, If everyone in the world was opposed to politics how would the world work, would the world work at all? it might not depending on what do you define as politics, btw what do YOU define as politics, does politics include issues of gay people being killed for being gay and people working to end that? would an apolitical world even have names for being a man and loving another man, would an apolitical world have an issue with this, how would a mostly or completely apolitical world deal with crime and murder.

have you considered how much is influenced by politics? To put it another way have you thought about what you personally consider to be politics and how everyone has a different definition of what politics means? Depending on what your definition of politics is, so so so so so much is influenced by it, for example the concept of putting people into two boxes based on biology didn't just naturally happen, there are other societies which had more than two genders, and in some ways our understanding of gender and sex are influenced by politics, depending on what you mean by politics.

its really very complicated so when saying ""opposition to politics in general is my position"" I think its important to ask yourself lots of questions and figure out if you really are a political or not?","1441065975"

Going into refresh: keeping stock as clean as possible, keeping as many cards out of the waiting room as possible, putting as many CX into waiting room as possible.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","I used to live looking for happiness at the end of a destination. 

After running a few milestones I came to realize that I had accomplished my goals but found no lasting satisfaction. 

I began to read and learn about happiness and psychology. 

At some point I came to realize that the definition of Happiness as is currently defined in America is not sustainable. 

You spend the majority of your time pretty much neutral. Whether you're an amputee or a lottery winner, eventually we balance out to equilibrium. 

Unless you have depression or some other mental illness, which needs to be treated directly in the same way you'd treat a broken arm or a virus. 

So over time I came to learn that happiness is not the destination but the journey. You gotta smell the roses and what not. 

Cool concept in theory, harder for application. 

Then I had a break down. Depression. Turns out I had been dealing with some form of depression since my dad died about 8 years ago but this time it was bad. 

Like, how do I get myself out of bed to go eat? 

When things got pretty close to catastrophic, I went to therapy. 

I learned about mental health, and began to practice a mantra that is often said but seldom followed ""love yourself"". 

Loving yourself is letting go of crappy friends because they're no good for you. Loving yourself means eating healthy, sleeping well and exercise to nourish your body. 

Loving yourself is picking yourself first before others. Loving yourself is holding onto the people that make your life better. 

Loving yourself is treating yourself to a reward after a hard days work. Loving yourself means being able to sit in the same room with yourself in silence. 

Loving yourself is working through your emotions so that you don't let your emotions work you. 

Loving yourself is going after your dreams and passions even, and especially when, you stumble and fall.

Loving yourself is being kind to yourself, if you wouldn't cuss out your best friend and call him a loser or a failure, then why would you do it to yourself?

Loving yourself is asking for help when you need it.

I learned that you need the foundation before you can build an edifice. The sturdier the foundation, the more epic your castle. 

And it's a lifelong process. We never stop growing, learning, making mistakes, etc. There will be hard days and that's ok because there will always be brighter tomorrows. 

So what keeps me going? Me. Because that's what it means to love and that's all I need. ","1441065975"

Taj Tandoor on Rundle St - the food was amazingly delicious. The service was a smudge over average but I'm still dribbling over my fish curry.

British India- solid food, I think everyone at the table said theirs was nice. Menu seems to have shrunk and is a little less British but enjoyable. Service was a juxtaposition of good and not good things: very very polite but failed to do drink checks through the night ( we often had to leave table and flag someone down and it took a while to order food though it did come out quickly once ordered). It was a full house though so I'm cutting them slack.

This is something that might be programmed around, or it might not be a big deal in many games.

False accusations are not the reason these posters are a problem. The reason they're a problem is because women are also perpetrators of sexual assault, education is not the reason people rape, and these posters address all men as if they're potential sex criminals. 

&gt;What's more, the majority of the false claims aren't the ""regret"" excuse that this thread is perpetuating.

There is a myriad of reasons for why people make false accusations. Regret is just one of them. The reason people in this thread are pointing it out in the first place is because the offensive, directed at females version of this poster would be ""regret is not rape, don't be that girl"". Which would rightfully be condemned for painting all women as false accusers.

Especially one like this which is quite symbolic and important in the ideological fight against privatisation of public services. If a Labour MP was to express a different view on say the flag debate, I wouldn't be too concerned. Heck even if he could be seen to be acting purely in his role as TTT MP, it wouldn't be so bad. But he's the Labour spokesperson for Maori education, for Christ's sake, if anyone should be promoting Labour's own policy in this arena it's him.

Electronic components very much do have limits. You can't run a CPU at 100% for months on end and expect it to live forever. Things like heat and electrical-variance all eventually take their toll. 

Higher-quality gear is somewhat LESS susceptible to these things.. because it's often made of higher quality components and is better tested and has better QA (Quality Analysis). But I have seen high-end WiFi-adapter or Routers eventually ""go bad"". 

&gt; ""If I were to download 10TB of data by leaving my laptop on 24/7 for the next month, would this wear out the wi-fi card? Is it possible to cause enough wear and tear on the wi-fi card that it no longer stops working or needs to be replaced? How about on the router?""

If you're using some cheap $10 WiFi card and a cheap/shitty $30 Router.. then sure... it could happen. Probably won't.. but I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility. 

If you're using a nice $60 WiFi card.. and a nice $200 ASUS or Airport Extreme Router?.. (and it's properly ventilated and NOT stacked in a hot closet or on top of other equipment)... then you should be fine.

So now instead of having people pop in and ask, 'Are we winning,' and then leave, we will instead have people pop in and ask, 'Are we winning,' and then AFK for 5 mins eating up a spot that could be taken by someone who tries.

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","&gt; Also her way of plainly labeling things sexist and misogynist without really knowing the true intentions of the specific persons creating it.

Unfortunately, a lot of people don't get that authorial intent doesn't really matter very much when you're critiquing a text.  The author can have the best intentions in the world and still inadvertently (or even deliberately) create something that is or has bad elements or subtext, especially when viewed as part of a meta-narrative.  The fact that the filmmaker intended to create an enjoyable film doesn't mean that, for example, *Battlefield Earth* is any good. 

However, the fact that the work has bad elements doesn't necessarily mean that the creator(s) is a bad *person*.

Bioware is a pretty good example of this.  We know that they have good intentions regarding LGBTA issues (because they're usually pretty open with what they want to achieve and why).  But their good intentions don't mean that they're immune to criticism for the things that they get wrong or include because they think that they're saying x when in reality they're saying y.  Are people who are criticizing their work saying that they're horrible human beings?  No#.  The critics generally assume that the Bioware folks are good people who made some mistakes (because, well, everybody makes mistakes) and who might try to avoid making those same mistakes again if the critics draw their attention to the problems and make a good case as to why they're problems.

"asatru","t5_2r5lh","I wanted to respond to this earlier, but I have had a long day with school and I wanted to be able to give it my full attention and thought because this is a topic that is important to me.

I was diagnosed in 2011 with Agorphobia with Panic Disorder. I have struggled with panic/anxiety attacks my whole life. My parents say I was a very anxious child. I've been a prepper since I was about 4! 

First thing first - Anxiety is a medical disorder. It is something that can be treated with the right combination of medication and therapy. Mental illness has always been a huge source of shame for me. I have thought quite frequently that I was inferior or lesser because of my illness. There is strength, however, in knowing you have that illness and desiring to get treatment.

I am going to be brutally honest here -  you need to decide what is good for your tribe regarding social media and the internet. I took a Facebook hiatus for about a year because it triggered my anxiety so badly. After that, I did a purge and got rid of a lot of drama and bullshit. Facebook anything is fairly toxic. To be honest, 99% of my Facebook usage is keeping close with family and promoting the podcast. 

If coming to Reddit causes you anxiety, then take a break. Or just sit back and read. When I am in my anxiety, I give myself permission to just read. You can even use the np.reddit.com to keep yourself from posting/responding so that you can learn without feeling like you are being judged. 

I still struggle with what other people think, and being a people pleaser. It all ties into anxiety. You have to learn to love yourself first. I have found the best way to do that is to do estimable acts. Here is where I tie it back to Heathenry - I use the core code of ethics I have from Heathenry (That which is good for the tribe is good) to help me make good choices and perform right action. Building that esteem will allow you to more easily deal with the things that cause you anxiety. Remember that you are a part of a tribe, a family, and you have worth passed down from our ancestors.

On a more practical note,  I have two resources that really helped me. First is the book [Overcoming Anxiety for Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470574410/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687522&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0764597930&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0NDJ5MN0TK1JSJT2XDYZ). I found this book to be an amazing tool in helping me learn to bring my anxiety down from a 10 to a 5. The other is [Anxious to Please: 7 Revolutionary Practices for the Chronically Nice.](http://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Please-Revolutionary-Practices-Chronically-ebook/dp/B001U29UDK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441065851&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=anxious+to+please) This book will help tremendously with the people pleasing and worrying about others opinions.

Good luck. If you want to chat, you can always PM me and I will do my best to help. ","1441065989"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Thats good to hear! At least you know it isn't the amp now!

Assuming that turning everything else in the room off (and you didn't forget anything!) didn't help then it could be quite tricky. It may be that there are wires running through the walls that are causing the problems. There would be no cheap and easy way of fixing that (you'd have to drag all the wires out and apply more shielding, but that is a job for a trained professional and it wouldn't be cheap).

On the amp side I'm not too sure. Getting the highest quality guitar cable might help things. Similarly it might be possible to get a better amp-speaker cable. Other than that I'm not sure. It might be worth starting a new post asking about that specifically.

One thing to consider might be a noise gate pedal. Setting the gate suitably low you may be able to cut out the unwanted noise without effecting your playing too much.","1441065990"

Plus, he is not a terrible body to have on defense alongside Duncan. You could also make a case for a West/Duncan frontcourt in the clutch Honestly, that's why I'm excited to see them this year because I want to see how LMA and West can improve with our defensive system. I think West would match up well against Griffin, but I don't know if Griffin is any worse a match up with LMA than Diaw. I know that Aldridge did have good offensive showings v.

In any program, you'll have instants of time when variables do not have any valid value.

It's also suggested that variables such as strings can be initialed to a known ""empty"" value, but that ""moves the problem"" from NULL to the known empty value.   
This a characteristic of logic, and every solution is more complex, ultimately, then simply having a NULL constant and testing against it.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt;Your position clearly targets one primary group, immigrants

More false lies. 

My position equally applies to any native born who seeks out a second citizenship. If one takes into account the numbers of Canadians ancestrally from such  countries as Germany and the UK and Ireland which offer fast track citizenship to 3rd generation Canadian descendants this number far outnumbers recent immigrants.  

&gt;You then go on to claim ignorantly that you cannot be loyal to two countries

Ignorant, How nice. More name calling. Are you in grade 3 on the school yard trying to bully me? Next will you call me fat and ugly ?

My position is the opposite of ""ignorant"", but in fact the exact same as the European country with the number one most progressive non-racist open immigration policy, Norway, which under all circumstances forbids dual citizenship. 

&gt;And no you do not swear loyalty to Canada alone, you just swear loyalty to Canada 

Yes Canadian Armed forces members swear loyalty to Canada's Queen alone, as do Members of Parliament, RCMP, etc.

&gt;nor does the law in Canada prevent me from having citizenship from another country and I am glad that is the case.

My opinion is that you and all other dual citizens must be forced to either give up Canadian citizenship or your other ones, and my opinion is neither ""bigoted"" as defined as irrational hatred of someone due to race , religion color etc. nor is it ""ignorant"" defined as not based on facts or logic.

It is you who are an ignorant bigot attacking me with insults because I dare not to agree with you.

Toolbox is invaluable.  Someday soon reddit itself may incorporate a lot of what it does.  That would be good because it's a pretty heavy addon, at least on firefox.  Reddit pages load slower with it on.  But it's so handy you won't care.  

Anyway I'd ask anyone who mods how they access reddit most of the time.  It's much more difficult to moderate if they're only using a smartphone or tablet.  In my opinion, anyway.

IFTTT is good.  Sometimes there's some lag, but it's reliable.  Reddit has an RSS feed for every page.  I'm sure there may be another app that's better but I use IFTTT for a lot of other things too.

I'm still going to start a blog, but it's going to be a lot more than I had intended.  I have some friends from the music scene who want to start a site that combines baseball and music.  Odd mix, but the way it was presented to me it sounds like it's crazy enough to work.  I don't intend to replace reddit, though.  I just want a space to write more analytical stuff.","1441065995"

Sure, but aren't we shooting for creating the most fitting state space.  That is, if your type shouldn't allow an unset Object, then it shouldn't allow an unset object.  The author isn't arguing against unset values.

So in the case where you want to create a Pair (or whatever else) with (temporarily) uninitialized contents, it seems like the options are either to pass it null or some expression for a type-matched unset.

As a purist, I understand that a type-matched unset feels cleaner, but I don't see it as functionally different from null.  Both represent an empty value, neither can have member methods invoked without producing an error.","1441065996"

"Netrunner","t5_2td0c","I personally agree with the sentiment that banning Astroscript ""makes little sense,"" but I do agree that there are major problems with the NBN agenda suite. The problem is not Astroscript. It is Project Beale. Hear me out.

Imagine a world where NBN only had access to the printed 2/1, 3/1, 4/2, and 5/3 agendas. To score one of these with no tricks you can fast advance the 2/1, never advance the 3/1, and install advance the rest. Having a scored Astro lets you fast advance 3/1 agendas and never advance 4/2 agendas. This allows you more easily bluff agendas as unadvanceable assets or upgrades, and spring much more powerful agenda based traps like Charachter Assassination and Market Research.

Now look at Project Beale. Sure the Astrotrain was bad, but if you stole 1 you were usually okay. Now all NBN has not only too many tools to fast advance (the real kicker is coming,) it has too many targets to fast advance. Beale doesn't need to have an ability. When was the last time you scored Beale and used its ability? Honestly if this agenda was a 4/2 I think NBN would have a much healthier corp identity with much more brutal 3/1 and 4/2 on score effects. And yes, there are a few cards in The Universe of Tomorrow that will make me put my Beales back in the box, mainly because never advance NBN looks really viable again.

The MRAs who see the education gap as a problem don't just point to the statistics and assert that therefore there is a problem. They point out actual structural biases against boys in the education system. These are not social pressures. It's not about boys being pushed away from college as an option.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Sorry reality doesn't align with your opinions.

Irony.

I don't know if you're trolling or you really lack the capacity to understand what you're saying but you're taking what is essentially an epidemiological study done in a predominantly liberal region in a decidedly liberal state and drawing conclusions that are completely baseless. It's like doing a study of 10 Cambodians and seeing which ones get sick and saying ""i'm not trying to be racist, but isn't it strange that only Cambodians seem to be getting sick?"" What's the conclusion that you're trying to draw here? That a cluster doesn't exist in a sparsely populated region like Fresno despite ranking high in under-immunization cases? are you making some sort of value judgement regarding an implied critical threshold that these clusters exist because they're 80% democratic instead of 70% at which point vaccine refusal rates suddenly drop down to 2.4% despite being overwhelmingly liberal? If this study was done in a predominantly conservative region, would you expect to see anything different?

Your argument basically boils down to ""my source is science and it uses keywords that are vaguely associated with the topic at hand so I'm going to make no effort to actually prove my point or understand the paper i am sourcing, just going to suggest everyone else suffers from cognitive dissonance.""  

Meanwhile the Pew poll shows that across america, this is an issue that is fairly bi-partisan with sympathies on both sides and studies attempting to actually study this phenomena find no strong correlation one way or other another.

So really, *you* go nuts, because I'm not going to argue with someone who apparently thinks science is something you can just load into a gun and fire because he lacks the basic level of reading comprehension to understand he's thrown a .357 magnum into a gun designed for a .38 special, a feat made especially special given the effort put in place to keep that from happening.","1441065998"

Same with a new marketing manager who is hired by a new company, usually one of the first things they do is fire the agency and start competitive pitches, even if the agency has been ultra successful. 

So all this talk of 'know-how' and 'connections' is not true from what I have seen (even if the agency has a relationship with the CEO of the company, many times I have seen them say in the same breath ""your campaign is working the best we have ever had"", but then ""we need to give the marketing manager a chance"").

I also wouldn't recommend my kid blindly follow their passions - another failed beauty in Hollywood/L.A.? Another failed musician? A failed high school sports hero who could never make it in the big leagues?

"DestructiveReaders","t5_2z15u","&gt;anything from the the tap might as well be acid, said the the hotel staff, the coach driver and good old paranoia. 

I loved that line, I'll get that out of the way first. There were multiple lines I came across and actually thought to myself, 'damn, I wish I'd written that sentence,' so congratulations on what is to me a compelling voice/style. 

I will also add that I am not a short fiction reader, generally. I almost as a rule stick to novels because they are what I love to read. With that in mind my main problem with this piece was that I didn't feel attached to the main character, because everything that happened was so abstract and hard for me to visualize. This is not because your imagery is bad, because its really great. Rather, for me there's so much absurdity to process on an even otherwise practical level that it's hard for me to devote my energies to 'caring' about the character.

This is compounded, I think, by the letter format. Were this written, hypothetically, as a monologue in present-tense first person, we would feel more of the unsettled, alienated feeling that the main character suffers from. Were it, again hypothetically, a standard third person scene with two people having a conversation, I feel like it would allow us to better visualize the characters and thus become emotionally invested in them. All that to say that I never had a clear grasp on what the stakes were for these two characters. James never gets a voice, but MC's is so detached and kind of cool about the situation (like ""That's capitalism for you,"" as another reviewer pointed out) that I'm never exactly drawn in like I want to be, if that makes sense. 

Another thing that I think compounded my feeling detached from the main character was the way the syntax stayed mostly the same throughout the piece. I believe the letters as they proceed chronologically show a deepening of MC's fear and alienation, yet his 'voice' never changes. It is as slow, measured, and detailed in the beginning (""Saw Jesus Christ wearing a white gown and a red halo made of velvet."") as it is at the end (""Woke during dusk with a striped green-grey worm wrapped around my neck.""). I may be biased against this because I am a self-admitted fan of stream-of-consciousness writing, but I definitely feel that even with a simpler, more paratactic style, it can be very effective to slightly vary syntax at emotionally heightened moments. I appreciate the urge to try to write as tightly as possible, but I myself sometimes felt the writing was so tight that all the emotion had been squeezed out of the words, and that what I was reading was so unnecessarily tidy, particularly when the imagery was so lush and the observations so witty. 

Those are all my rambling, badly-expressed thoughts. In any case keep up the good work, because this was a fun read, and happy writing

I think that Nicki was talking about the industry itself and how it caters/favors  white skinny people rather than those who are anything but. She says that the white people before her got recognition for their raunchy and ""innovating"" videos (blurred lines,wrecking ball) for going against the norm and then preceding to win awards while Anaconda was seen as too much and tasteless etc. Nicki wasn't making jabs at artists who got nominated but the industry who *only* recognizes skinny white beauty.","1441066005"

&gt;Have unexploded shells, either bombs or land mines in the city.

You have no idea how much I'm going to use this. This party has experience with bouncing betty mines already, but they haven't come across unexploded heavy munitions yet.

&gt;Have shelter quality and quantity low.

I'm already planning for them to be carefully counting their bullets. I'm a big fan of making safe shelter hard to find, too.

&gt;Have separate currencies, one for the insane exiled country and one normal, at least.

I'm thinking more eliminate currency entirely for the city and make the entire system based off bartering. Maybe the ""currency"" is bullets, like in Metro 2033?

&gt;Have tense, preferably abusive, soldiers acting as guards.

Reading my mind right here. Soldier-civilian tensions are always sky-high.

&gt;Have a dog-eat-dog setting. Nobody will help another, that's the sole task of the pcs

The only people helping each other out are bands of refugees that are helping themselves out internally. But otherwise, yeah, total *Mad Max* craziness.

&gt;Have the threat of war looming. Like a newspaper that says concerning military mobilization etc.

While there isn't a newspaper being printed, the players can get access to functioning radios that can tap into public radios and military channels. I'm planning on having a couple airborne divisions from the occupying force's nation drop in to settle everything once and for all about six months into the timeline. That'll be fun.

&gt;Have more women than men. Many of them widowed, losing their husbands to war. Also, have a need for ""handyman"" tasks.

I do love me some well-developed female characters. Done.

&gt;Have at least one time that the party must run to a bomb shelter.

"UkrainianConflict","t5_30hhs","here is what Poroshenko said today:

http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2015/08/31/7079679/

Let me quote a few choice bits at you:

&gt; Проект изменений в Конституцию не предусматривает особого статуса для Донбасса. 

This project does not allow for any special status for Donbass.

&gt; Более того, мы убираем из действующей Конституции статью 92, которая предусматривает теоретическую возможность провозглашения специального статуса для отдельных городов - чтобы не было даже малейшей юридической зацепки для парада суверенитетов

We are removing stature 92 from the current constitution, which is the last stature that could allow for special status for CITIES. The goal is to remove any reference in the Constitution to special statuses to anyone.


&gt; то касается специфического порядка осуществления местного самоуправления в отдельных районах Донецкой и Луганской областей, то он определяется отдельным законом, который уже дважды принимался Верховной Радой - предыдущего и этого созыва. И срок его правомочности - три года, из которых один уже почти прошел

In regards to special status of Donbass, the temporary laws that allow for this only last 3 years, and 1 year is already GONE. [These are the laws Nuland had to come to Kiev last July to force him to pass]. And for these these laws to work, rebels have to surrender:

&gt; Большая часть статей этого закона пока приостановлена, и они могут заработать только после проведения на этих территориях выборов в соответствии с украинским законодательством и стандартами ОБСЕ. И только после вывода с украинской территории российских войск, после вывода оружия, после восстановления контроля над всем границей с РФ

The laws are not in force until rebels surrender. The end.

This is what Poroshenko said today.

So, let me ask you again. DID YOU ACTUALLY READ WHAT THEY PASSED TODAY, or you making stuff up? Cause it seems like you are making stuff up. About the language or military coop or economy.

Well you could stop thinking about small scale balance when it comes to this game.

Also  you've been in so many battles in PS2, when is everything ""perfect"" and not randomly chaotic?

&gt;If it is going to be lacking power, then why have it in the first place? I don't believe a middle ground will be achievable and it will be something either useless, or game breaking OP.

A middle ground is always achievable.

Also....... Your statement perfectly describes  what happened to the spitfire &amp; Valkyrie.


But the end of the day the reason why they failed, is because of the devs &amp; the players irrationally fearing things.

Sucking in chicken fats? Causing droughts?

The Grand River Watershed already has a Water Management Plan. It is also typically at risk for flooding, which is why they have dams and dikes all over place. There is no risk of running out of water anytime in the forseeable future.

The watershed covers 6800km^2 and stretches 300km where it drains into Lake Erie. 152,000,000m^3 /year are drained from the watershed per year, and 626,000,000m^3 /year is the maximum before the groundwater system can't recharge fast enough. 

Nestle wants to pull 584,000m^3 /year, or 0.4%. It's the same with out in BC, a veritable fart in the wind compared to the total amount of water available. 

All this push for monetization does is foment the idea that water is a commodity, and once it becomes finally classified as ""a commodity that can be bulk transferred"", than the shit will have finally hit the fan, because NAFTA says once something can being bulk exported from Canada to the US, you cannot stop it. Luckily, that hasn't happened yet. All this water that Nestle pumps out of the ground? It sells it inside Canada.

I'm not arguing it should be free. There should be administrative fees, and QA/QC fees, and inspections fees. But I don't think there should be fees on the actual water itself. Not for private companies, and not for people.

Anyway my point is there are some things you in life that forces you to think of other people's feeling. That's what happens when you're an adult. Wether you want to walk around naked, or you live with someone who walks around naked, you should disclose this information to the person you're dating and not invalidate their negative or positive feelings. 


It's got nothing to do with sexualising it or not, although judging by the OP he is in fact sexualising it a bit.

It will be terrifying, but not doing it is worse. You can do this.

I know you have concerns about your license, your son's sleeping arrangements, and other things. But you can't worry about the logistics of these yet- you can't do step 5 until you do step one. Leaving is step one. Once you are out, after some time and support, you will have a chance to think a little more clearly and you will figure out a  solution. You can do this, but you have to start somewhere, you have to start with leaving.

Releasing him prior to today would have been a poor strategic decision, since any number of things could happen in camp that would change their plans to release Jackson. It would be far worse, for example, if they had dumped Jackson prior to training camp only to have McCoy suffer a nasty injury.

The dime has more tools I use everyday and it's much smaller. Even though the build quality isn't as good, it still gets the job done just fine.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; After discrete, residential evacuation? Yes. And don't try and say that isn't possible because there are procedure for that exact thing and happens many times when a convict or shooter is on the loose so I feel an operation that has taken months to plan could account for that.

The officer met the dealer in the Bronx. The dealer then said to go to Mount Vernon. Please explain to me how you're going to evacuate Mount Vernon? They had teams following the undercover officers, how  do you expect them to evacuate Mount Vernon before the officer and dealer get there? The thing is **you can't.**

&gt; This is where you start to sound childish with bullshit arguments rather than any figment of logic. Obviously the officer should shoot what he sees as an armed gunman. Should he shoot more than 3 times after having hit the assailant with all three shot? How about shooting 11 shots? To put it bluntly, they fucked up. **The guy was shot three times before the bystander was shot at all** then another dozen and a half shots go off...why? Was the shooter (after having taken three shot to the abdomen) shooting back still with his replica gun? It grade A bullshit of the highest order. These people go through ""extensive training"" (actually they don't and that's the issue) and they should be able to show a little bit of restraint.

Was the assailant down? Did the assailant drop the weapon (yes it was fake, but **obviously, it looked real**)? If the guy was still holding his weapon, he was still a threat. And the thing about restraint: illegal gun dealers don't have any restraint.

&gt; In regards to the bystander shooting? All of it. The criminal is obvious in the wrong for the obvious reasons but the police were steering the situation and instead of just letting the guy run away while monitoring him from the various other angles of vision they had on him (multiple teams, heli, teamwork and communication) the undercover moron decided to escalate the situation well after he learned that the gun the perp had was not threatening. He shot a guy running away not a guy standing still pointing a gun at him or someone else.

I think the problem is that you don't understand how these operations work. This isn't the movies. The surveillance teams aren't perfect, and most of them are further away from the undercover officer than you think. Let an armed criminal run away and you might need a house to house search to find him. Also, can you cite your source for ""undercover moron decided to escalate the situation well after he learned that the gun the perp had was not threatening""?

&gt; I also put a lot of blame on the police for not better protecting the citizens around the gun bust. They had teams (MULTIPLE FUCKING TEAMS) of officers and no one decided to be the team managing the civilians assisting them when the shit hit the fan? Multiple teams of police for one guy and not one team dedicated to public safety?

The thing about these types of undercover operation is that they have to happen with civilian around. If you remove all civilians from the area beforehand, the bad guys are going to know that something is up. Again, this isn't a movie. Again, the officer met the dealer in the Bronx. The dealer then wanted to go to Mount Vernon. 

&gt; All in all, as just one of the sheep that didn't die in this, I call this operation a farce. It seems like it was poorly plan, poorly executed, and poorly managed. And while shit does happen and you cannot account for everything, someone should be there to accept responsibility for the police actions. Instead they defect blame and decline comment. Even if this was as flawless as it got and someone still died in the process, OWN THE FUCKING MISTAKE AND TELL THE PUBLIC WHAT FUCKING HAPPENED. Cops aren't trusted today for a reason. It is not one officer. It is not one state's police. It is not one regions police. It is the entire country's police system. Obviously there are good cops out there, no doubt, but when you consistently ready these horrible bs stories and read countless stories of terrible training and terrible academy requirements, you start to wonder...what the fuck is going on?

Cops today aren't trusted because we have a culture that glorifies violence and criminal behavior. The officer that shot Michael Brown was vindicated by an autopsy but Black Lives Matter is still trying to get justice for him. People that hate cops will always hate cops. No amount of facts will change that. But please remember: Criminals kill a lot more innocent people than cops do, but we never see this amount of outrage when a criminal kills innocent people.","1441066021"

I grew up in the South and stayed through my early 20s and women there tend to be obsessed with getting married and having kids as soon as possible. At 23 I couldn't think of anything I wanted less than kids at the moment. I guess they'd be better than AIDS or cancer, but you get my point.

Moved to the Bay Area 3 years ago and for the most part my experience is the exact opposite. I mean I totally appreciate independence and ambition in women, but once we get to know each other it shouldn't feel like such a chore to find all these things to do just to keep her vaguely focused on me.","1441066023"

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Congrats!

11k sounds on the high side, I budgeted for 9k and it's been pretty accurate so far. What are they charging for airplane rental? What are you doing for ground school? If they plan on doing your ground as a 1-on-1, you need to take a look at something like sportys online ground school or MzeroA. 1-on-1 ground school is pretty ineffecient, but mileage may vary depending on your learning style. Personally, I used sporty's and other various self-study materials, then my instructor quizzes me on things to see if I learned it (during pre-flight and during the lesson). We also met for 4 hours the other day to do oral exam and checkride prep, he completely fried my brain, but it was good. He was tougher on me than any normal checkride would be. (he even threw in a few rotorcraft-related questions to try and confuse me).


Unless you have the money, I'd go with a basic $100 headset (more like headclamp). I'm glad I didn't jump right into an expensive set, because I only just heard about QT Halo which I really want to try now.


I'm just finishing up my training (was actually supposed to do my checkride today, but the plane said no). Poop. Now I'll have to wait another 3 weeks before my schedule, the plane's schedule and the DPE's schedule all line up.","1441066024"
"venturecapital","t5_2rhvm","You have a patent application in, I assume, not a patent. Its important to protect your IP.

Focus on getting some sales. Look to Angel investors if you're looking for seed capital to build your initial inventory. You may have better luck finding speciality stores, or regional stores, that are always looking for differentiating products. Avoid the VCs as long as you can, with the caveat that they can accelerate your growth, but frequently at a cost to you (equity). That being said, don't be so stingy on your equity that you don't get your product out to the market quickly. Someone **will** copy you if the idea is a good one. 

You might also consider creating an advisory board. These are frequently experienced business people that will donate their time in consideration of stock and/or a board position once you've incorporated.

The gravity isn't all that incredible (from an astrological standpoint), only about 2.5 times that of earth. This also means that the gases we see aren't very dense. Much of what we see is gases swirling around at less than earth's atmospheric pressure. It's only when we start to get a little deeper, that things get really crazy. Also, while the wind speeds at the red spot are incredible, near the poles it would be much more accessible for a probe to enter and hang out for a little while in. One last neet thing about Jupiter, is that it's about as large (by volume) as a planet can get. If Jupiter were much heavier, it would actually start to shrink.","1441066026"

Shortly after this the Terran navy detects incoming ships.

Being outnumbered, Admiral Pendergast sets an ambush for the incoming fleet (which is the AI, of course). He sends half his fleet (5 frigates and 3 cruisers) to the far side of one of the moons of the planet they are in orbit around.

I'm not knocking what the designers have accomplished. Writing a good mystery short story is really hard and writing one that players can access in any order and still make sense is nearly impossible. The game is playable and by that fact it is a small miracle.

I think I'm on the 7th case and I've never finished a case and felt satisfied, like what the clues told me lead to the solution that Sherlock presents at the end. Some of his leaps of logic are insane. If you were to pursue an actual criminal case the way Sherlock solves mysteries, no one could call it justice or proof. It's more like ""it looks like this person did it, and we don't have anyone else, so he probably did it"".

It has a unique charm to it and if you're ok with working hours on a case and then reading a solution and wanting to throw the book to the floor, then it's the game for you.","1441066032"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'm a little surprised about this too.

/u/indigosnowflake, I applaud you for being to survive the abuse and slavery that you endured for years, and I think it is fantastic that you are speaking out and educating the public about your experience.  You're very brave!  I think it's so important that you keep speaking to the public and bringing awareness to this issue. 

However, I don't see how it helps to stigmatize other communities.  While I am sure there are abusers in the BDSM community, there are also abusers in plenty of other communities (such as the army, as stated in your experience).  **Abuse knows no bounds.**  Let's not lambast an entire [sometimes stigmatized](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15546128.2012.650984#.VeTraflVhBc) community based on the presence of some abusive individuals in that community.  There are indeed individuals that engage in safe, healthy, consensual BDSM play who are not abusers/not being abused.  

For reference, here are some published papers on this.  [This one](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00795.x/full) states that BDSM practitioners are not more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity than non-practitioners.  [This one](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12192/full) suggests that BDSM isn't associated with psychopathology.  [This one](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-013-0392-1) delineates differences between ""healthy"" and ""abusive"" BDSM practices. 

Of course, there are response biases in this research, and stigmatized individuals might not feel comfortable speaking about the entirety of their experiences, particularly potentially traumatic experiences.  However, lumping every BDSM practitioner together as an abuser or someone who is being abused doesn't do anything to help the situation.

So, in short, I applaud you for speaking up and being honest about your beliefs and experiences, but I also hope that we all can continue to educate others on sex slavery and other abuses while making the content of our education inclusive for all.","1441066033"

You're engaging with it as a topic and set of concepts, not trying to deliberately make people feel shitty or be discriminatory against them. This is what I'd have an issue with!

I'm not advocating an anti-this-game position and I hope that's clear, I am concerned with an anti-advocacy-for-being-a-terrible-person position if that makes sense. I don't know that its existence is advocating anything, but I think that the way that an issue is explored is more important than what issues are being explored to an extent.

There is a place for everything, but not being sensitive to things that will make members of your communities feel unsafe and unwanted is bad. If you feel the need for there to be a TTRPG that explores rape culture or the ramifications of the act on the human psyche, don't introduce it as something that is actively being promoted and celebrated in your setting - don't use it as a 'shock factor' to sell your product. This is disingenuous and insulting to people affected by the issues that people are advocating the positive influences of the existence of your game as a medium to explore or discuss.

I still don't have a fully formed opinion on the whole issue, but I think that there are distinctions not being made, that I guess I've hinted at above, that I feel are important in discussions or representations of contentious topics.","1441066033"

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I'm going to play devil's advocate on this. I've played Hearthstone since beta and most people who frequent this subreddit have also been playing for a while. Now in this time I've introduced a handful of friends to Hearthstone. Most of them either get really into it and become one of us, or get bored or frustrated with it and stop playing. 

See, we've kind of lost perspective on what it means to be a new player, and most of us are probably far from ""casual"". To a casual player -- a truly casual player -- this game is always bullshit. These are players who still don't know what half the cards do. Whenever they see most Epics or Legendaries hit the board they stop, read it, and think ""what bullshit"". That's how my ex-girlfriend plays; a few games a week, totally casually. The idea of netdecks, the metagame, or even deck archtypes at all are just completely over her head. 

To her Priests are ""total bullshit"" because ""they just heal forever"". She plays Paladin because she ""likes having lots of dudes"". Midrange? Aggro? Control? Combo? Gibberish. She vaguely remembers what each class is good at and that's what she works with. She'll have to see a card four or five times in action before she remember what it does. She doesn't look through her collection and try to remember them. She'll use the basic decks when she gets quests for classes she doesn't usually play because she doesn't want to try to put a deck together for them.

To her the game is RNG. All of it. Every new card that she sees played might as well be a totally random card because there's so many that she doesn't know. A Knife Juggler getting perfect throws is small-time compared to seeing a crazy Legendary like Gallywix or Antonidas. And those ""simple"" card texts that Blizzard loves so much? I can't tell you how many times she would show me a card and ask me what it means. The whole game is just a crazy random clusterfuck for her. And remember, she's been playing for more than seven months.

And she's the sort of player that Blizzard builds the game for. Remember that there are probably just as many mobile players as there are PC players now, possibly many more. Hearthstone's been sitting at around the #5 spot on the play store top grossing list ever since it came out. That's millions of players who are probably just like my ex-girlfriend. True casuals.

Then again if it's a trojan attached to something then once it's launched, it can copy itself to Services (making it persistent and unable to get deleted without safe mode), the Registry (to constantly put itself back in place if it does get deleted somehow) and even copy the trojan multiple places for further protection. Also if it makes a service, some of them don't use that much memory or processing power. A lot of them are pretty quiet depending on how well it was coded. But if the coder can do all of this, then they will make the service hidden, or change administrator privilages so that even if it is there in the Task Manager, it wont be able to be disabled by turning off that option through security policies (you'd be amazed what you can turn off here).","1441066035"

If she changed it, only the device she changed it on would know the new password.  This is Security 101.  Basic stuff.  Microsoft would be crucified for violating that.  Besides, I know for a fact that is true.  It's part of my profession.

FACT: If she changes her password, he will NOT have access to her account.

FACT: When she changes her password, his device will NOT know the new password.  No other device will know it.

"Neopia","t5_2wjl6","Last week was great, besides Friday... Friday was just stupid. I'm a mod on a tiny internet forum, which is dedicated to a very niche game. It used to be my favorite forum, but it's been filled with petty drama for the past year now. Things like users ^(and friends) leaving for badly explained reasons, mods leaving because those users left, and other small bits of drama that slowly start to wear on my patience. The latest drama happened last Friday. It's really stupid and immature and I'd say more if I wasn't sure the user in question used reddit. I highly doubt they know my username, but this is Reddit. ^(/tin foil hat)

Today was, thankfully, boring and dramafree. I got some boring chores done, like cleaning my Betta's tank, and even found time to play around with my level 22 mage in Skyrim. I have two spell mods installed and it's amazing. I can cast two or three long duration fire damage spells, run around like an idiot for a while, and the enemy just drops dead. Even better is the unlock spell! I don't have to fuss with stupid locks anymore, as long as my Alteration skill is high enough anyway. I hate that mini game.","1441066036"

"poker","t5_2qhix","I'd assume it's all about the table limit.

A 24 tabling reg at pokerstars is the equivalent of 6 4 tabling regs on Bovada.

The 2nd part is, as soft as the tables are, if you're playing 50 or 100NL with only 4 tables, you're probably a part-time player at most.  Without the volume or rakeback available, I think you'd expect to see the 'pros' and 'semi-pros' at higher stakes than at Stars, and that affects everyone down the line.  Meaning, you can rise a lot higher on Bovada before you run into a bunch of higher level players.

So to answer more directly, Bovada low and microstakes aren't attracting the high skill high volume players, which creates a very different ecosystem.","1441066036"

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","It depends on the starting mass.

If the mass was about a megaton, it would start by releasing 10^20 watts or so.  DITL, which is arguably the most generous interpretation, rates the Galaxy Class overall power output at around 10^6 TerraWatts. or 10^18 watts, so 100 times the max power.  Ship meltdown occurs immediately.

Over the course of 84 seconds it would convert all 1000 metric tons of mass to energy via E=mc^2, yielding 9 x 10^22 joules.  For comparison, that's about a quarter of the energy of the impact which killed off the dinosaurs.

But maybe they only convert a few kilograms at a time, in which case failure would be the equivalent of a photon torpedo or two going off in main engineering.","1441066036"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","It doesn't matter that you still live with family.  That's relatively common nowadays, even if there is a great push to 'leave the nest'. 

The problem is that you have two degrees you're not using, and you're going down yet another path.  You're not focusing.  You're not building skills that can get you a career, you're jobbing.  Granted, psychology usually requires a master's degree for reasonable jobs, and I'm not sure about philosophy - but I can tell you that for me (finance, going the consulting track) if I had delayed even a year or two, I would not have gotten anywhere near as many calls or opportunities as I do now.  Leaving the workforce is verboten, your skills atrophy, and you become damaged goods in the eyes of employers.  Same if you wait too long after school.  Your skills dull, you forget the tools of the trade, you forget your material from school.  When you graduated, you were 100% of a graduate.  If you get into the workforce, you're at 125% - you have more skills.  If you do nothing after graduating, you're at 80%.  Employers would rather hire the new grads. 

I don't want to be harsh, but that's the way it's worked in my industry at least.  

It's normal to not know what you want.  I fill my time with work (too much of it), and listening to / reading books about psychology, mainly motivation and fulfillment.  The book ""Drive"" is pretty interesting.  

You need to find something that you may not ""love"", but that you can do for work to earn enough to allow you to truly grow up and support your family (if that's what you want).  I have a feeling that's pretty hard as a maybe-wannabe trainer.

The blue (?) slim/straight leg pants you wore a lot looked great though I think. If you want to keep wearing wider legged pants, I'd recommend pairing them with a fitted top. 

One recurring issue I noticed with your outfits was your shirts being too long (for example look at 46, 32 and 30). The long shirt makes your torso look long compared to your legs which in turn makes you look shorter and also a bit wider than you actually are.

Some of my favourite looks were 43, 37 and 6 - key things from these looks: a more streamlined/fitted silhouette, colours that look good on you and tops that hit you higher up, balancing out your torso/legs.","1441066039"

You have a **question** which probably has an **answer**, although frankly it doesn't seem like it because your question has fundamental flaws in how it assumes Reddit works (but that would only be relevant to this subreddit if the question itself was remotely appropriate for it).

"fantasywriters","t5_2t4ad","Okay. In my opinion writing should never make you anxious. If you don't enjoy it, even with bad dialogue and poor grammar, don't do it.

Putting up work for critique or sale is **very likely** to make you anxious because you worry about what people will think of your writing and it might not be complimentary.

So far you are quite normal. 

Why are you writing? If you are not sure but just feel compelled, then welcome. :) That is all of us here. And not everyone gets that. Especially if they look at your writing and see bad dialogue and poor grammar, they will wonder why you do it. This is not new. Writers have always for hundreds of years have had to deal with this. And all of them had parts of their writing they were good at, and parts they weren't.

Unless the only thing you do is writing and you have no plans to do anything else to make money, you friend/family member - whoever told you this, is incorrect. We do LOTS of things for enjoyment. And sometimes, when we get good at it, after practice, we can then sell or work at these things and make money from them. It is quite acceptable that writing is one of these things. 

I am bad at grammar, and English is my first language. I am good at a lot of things, very good at some things, but still I have trouble with grammar. So I have a friend check my work. Problem - solution.

Writing is a craft, and an art. You can learn how to do it and get better at it. What you cannot do is give someone the passion and desire to *want* to write, to want to express an idea, to want to share that idea and to want to entertain or inform with sharing that idea.

Follow your heart. Find a way to pay the bills. These may not be the same thing, but if you want to be happy - and rid yourself of anxiety, then make sure you do both.","1441066044"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","&gt; No OR here for the DM. It is provided in the MM and is a time saver. Use it. Not the players though, rolling damage is fun for them.

I had forgotten that 5e gives averaged damages. Also, it is fun to roll damage. Like I said, I only did this for an epic-level campaign (back in 3.5) where the time to roll damage was getting way out of hand.

&gt; Players need to start there turn with ""I move, I attack, I cast, I will..."" If they don't get it right out then they delay to the bottom of the init. If they still don't have it then they defend. In my opinion, your turn is not to be used to ask me how a power or spell works. If you don't know, then your character doesn't know.
&gt; One of my problems is the realization of what a spell REALLY does when I go to resolve it and then they want to take it back. But I'm griping here.

Agreed 100%. 

&gt; Use index cards folded in half like tents and let your players manage this for you, they know how to write with markers and 'sort descending'

Index cards a great. A medium-sized whiteboard can also be great. If you use a DM Screen, index cards draped over it are fantastic (and you can make notes on the DM's side!


&gt; Yea, this is hard to do but the phrase, ""That is about all you can convey to the group as a free action. Anymore and chit chat will be your action.""

Unless it becomes abused, we have a rule where talking **is** a free action. Any amount of talking. It's mostly so my BBEGs don't get shot mid-speech. But I extend the courtesy to my players. Unless it gets out of hand, in which case they know I'll revoke the houserule.

&gt; You are the level you are for the whole session when I start the session. You had x days/weeks to level up...we have started.

Great houserule. I agree with it completely, even if it sometimes means the characters get 2 levels at the beginning of the next session (lots of xp awarded in a particularly long session).


&gt; Also, your group might not be the type to want lots of combat. Go combat light for a while. In 4e, the most I could pull off was usually 1 combat encounter and our record was 2. Now 5e, I can get 2-4 in easy but they changed the game.

Just like you said, some groups may just not like combat as much as some of the other elements. I find that many players who don't like combat don't really understand it (or how to pay attention). It might be a good idea to either (1) give your group homework (""Read the combat chapter!"") or (2) go over what exactly combat is and why gameplay changes so dramatically during combat.

"hardwareswap","t5_2skrs","Well, I don't know about the longer life particulars. I do know, however, that these SSD's will either be equal to or slower than the faster consumer SSD's simply because of the 6gbps SATA III bottleneck. Pretty much all high end SSDs on SATA these days are limited by the bandwidth SATA III can provide. The 850 Pro and several other SSD's pretty much are maxing the available bandwidth available. 

&amp;nbsp;

The power failure features are available on high end consumer SSD's as well such as the Crucial M550. ..but not all consumer drives of course. In fact most don't have this. Two examples would be the Crucial BX series of SSD's. While they are fast, they lack features. Even the high end 850 Pro does not have power loss protection or end-to-end data protection.

&amp;nbsp;

I guess there are some features that server grade drives offer than no consumer drive will offer, but that is a huge premium to pay for something that no one here is likely going to be interested in.

Lol what? I gave my opinion about the server, I'm not on some anti lifeweb campaign. Chill the fuck out.

&gt;     Maybe I can assume you're trying to be as salty as possible, given your posts about the topic. See? It wouldn't be accurate, would it? I didn't have much info to extrapolate from. You don't either. Don't say the community is trying to be disgusting as possible because you sound like an ignorant fuck. Furthermore, by bringing this all to the public, you're increasing peoples' intolerance of the server and as a result will increase traffic to the server and fuck up their whole delicate balance of shit.

That's a huge extrapolation to make. I've played the server and on the forums. Can I read their minds? No, but I know when someone is trying too hard to be cool because I went to high school. 

&gt;I've never heard anything so ignorant. How are you going to confidently say they don't play there for reasons that could very well be true? Fuck, they could be forced to play there. They could be playing there because they like the game. They might be there for the reason you said, but the odds of that are astronomically low. 

Sorry I don't think bragging about how you want to rape chinese women with a pointy broom is a fetish, or at least not exclusively a fetish. Maybe you haven't seen these kinds of people but they are basically like 4chan and try to be contrarian and stand offish because they think it makes them cool.

&gt;Why would they try to be disgusting as possible but not bring it to the attention of the public? Could it be they're trying to out-gross eachother? Not likely. I'd advise you take that misinformed opinion, refine it a little bit after a little more research and testing of the server, then come back when you're ready to base your opinion off of something that isn't a cliched overused argument?

In short, Software devs produce software. Itunes, google chrome, microsoft word, etc. Usually devs are producing software that the average person won't use, often it's stuff designed specifically for companies like tracking sales, inventory, etc. 

Often it's not the most interesting software but it tends to pay well. Software engineering is a catch all term though, it can include people developing software to analyze disease or guide rockets. 

Game dev is generally considered the worst job in Software Engineering for the following reasons:

1. It's extremely competitive. Everyone and their mother wants to design games. You have to be the best of the best to get a job doing it. 

2. Long hours. Towards the end of development, game devs can expect to be working 100+ hour weeks to complete games on time. 

3. The slightly higher pay is generally not considered worthwhile for a developer working almost constantly. On top of constant work, you have to stay up-to-date with the most modern paradigms and technology to stay competitive. Even so, a lot of game companies will lay people off when they get too old because they want to keep fresh minds in development. Valve is one such company known to do this. 

There's some other things but I gotta go eat right now. ","1441066053"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","1. The NFL has a trade deadline during the regular season (around mid-October?). Trades are allowed from the start of the offseason up until the trade deadline, so all in all a window of about 8 months. Trades can involve players, draft picks, cash, or even coaches.

2. The NFL (32 teams) is broken into conferences (16 teams each), which are broken into division (4 teams each). Each season, a team will play each other team in their own division twice (once at home, once away). They will play each team in one other division in their own conference (the division they play is on a 3-year rotation); each team in one division in the opposite conference (the division they play is on a 4-year rotation); and two teams from the remaining divisions based on the previous season's division standings.

3. Players must be 19 years old and 3 years removed from highschool. Typically, players play on college teams before entering the NFL through the NFL draft. Teams do not have youth leagues. Depending on the position (some wear the body out more than others), players retire between ages 30 and 40. 

4. NFL teams have a general manager and a head coach. General managers are in charge of hiring the coaching staff, as well as player acquisition, trades, and scouting/drafting. General managers are hired by the team's owner (or someone the owner has put charge, e.g. John Elway). Head coaches are responsible for managing the game preparation and play calling, starting lineups, etc... Coaches and managers can be fired at any time, including during the season.","1441066054"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; &gt; In short, it is important to protect what may be a human life, but far more important to protect what certainly is human life.
&gt; 
&gt; It sure is easier to justify abortion when you ignore the fact that a fetus is, scientifically, biologically, unmistakably, a human being. This common myth ""we don't know for sure"" that a fetus is a human being is the same argument that creationists make in saying ""we don't know for sure"" that the theory of natural selection, or evolution occurs.

No, it isn't. Because the issue here is one of definition. How do you define a human being? At what point does something stop being raw tissue and potential and start being a *person*?

Science can describe the process by which this happens, the various stages and what happens in each stage, but it doesn't say when *personhood* actually happens.

Conversely, natural selection and evolution are pretty well-defined.

&gt; So the question is, who will bear the risk of the situation? Will it be the sexually active person, who did not intend for pregnancy to occur, but who at least has some control over the situation? Or will it be the preborn child, who has no control over the situation whatsoever, and whose very life is at stake?

Risk? What are you talking about? It's not even about risk. It's about rights that are unquestionably being violated. Now, you can argue that those rights should be violated to preserve more important rights of another, but then I revert back to my argument that that it is debatable whether the thing you are trying to preserve the rights of is actually a person.

&gt; &gt; And while the right to control one's own body may be secondary to the right to life, I do not believe it is secondary to the right to life of something that may or may not be a person.

&gt; So abortion must be available at six months, seven months, eight months, nine months, up until the moment the umbilical cord is snipped? Does that sound right?

We don't know when that thing becomes a person. But it *does* become a person at some point. Our society seems to have settled on ""by the third trimester"" (week 27 onward), but I would actually make the cutoff a little sooner than that - week 23 onward. Week 24-25 is the first week that a fetus shows regular brain activity, the first sign of actual human consciousness. While science cannot tell us when a person truly becomes a person, this strikes me as the clearest sign of actual personhood, and I think that most would likely agree that it is a good litmus test.

&gt; &gt; it's just plain fucked up to violate a person's rights to bring one more unwanted child into the world. Does the world really need more unwanted children?

&gt; Why not go and round up every ""unwanted"" 3-year-old child living in America and kill each of them

Because those are actual people, and your false equivalencies and slippery slope arguments are starting to bore me.

&gt; Can't do that because you can't kill a human being? If the unborn are also human beings, you can't justify abortion in these cases.

Sure. Except whether or not they're actually people is not agreed upon.

&gt; I don't want to live in a world where human life is devalued based on their perceived utility/wantedness/productivity, something that has already led the horrific social policies in years past.

Oh, get off your high horse. It already is devalued. It's why doctors and lawyers are paid more than fast food employees. They're more highly valued. And apparently, about half of our society is just fine with those fast food employees dying from a lack of medical care. You want to fight to save lives, why not fight to save *those* lives?

&gt; I don't want to live in a world where the children we decided to keep, that our lives have meaning and worth and dignity only so long as we are wanted and not a burden to others

I don't want to live in a world where the rights of women become disposable the minute that someone believes that thing growing inside her has more value than her rights do, regardless of whether other people agree that it's human or not.

&gt; Almost a 100 years ago policies based on the emerging science of eugenics

Ah, fer fuck's sakes, you brought this to eugenics. And gee, ""almost a hundred years ago"". I wonder whatever you could be referring to. Seriously, it's like every argument the right makes has to come back to the Nazis.

I wasn't arguing that we should put three year old children to death or abort babies based on whether they'd be a male or female or have an added risk of cancer. I was saying that we shouldn't force someone to carry a child to term when they don't want *any* child. Can you seriously not see the difference there?

&gt; &gt; At some point, our procreation will have limits placed on it, if not by governmental or societal reasons, then natural and environmental ones. Isn't it better to start with the births that aren't wanted in the first place?

&gt; It is not for us to decide who has a life worth living and who doesn't, and we certainly wouldn't want someone else making that decision for us.

Okay, so you'd prefer these deaths to be decided by war, famine, disease? As a population reaches maximum capacity, mortality due to these things increases dramatically. But I suppose you see that as a more moral path for humanity to take.

Personally, I'd like to see a world where every child born is born to parents that actually *want* that child and will not be doomed to poverty because of it. I'd like to see a world where those who feel they would be unfit parents *don't* have children. I'd like to see a world where we avoid exploding populations that lead to a scarcity of resources that effectively reduce *everyone* to poverty. I'd like to see a world where having a child is a choice and no child is an ""accident"".

I suppose this world is your nightmare, but the world your policies would lead to is mine.

As for making decisions for others, it is not for *you* to decide what women should do with that growth inside their body, simply because you see it as a person. They certainly wouldn't want you making that decision for them.

As for the fetus in question, which has no thoughts or even brain patterns, it has no opinion whether it should live or die. It is, for all we know, a thing. It could one day be a person. But so could the countless sperm that apparently now fill cumboxes in gross Reddit pictures, and the eggs that get flushed out of a woman's body on a monthly basis. Few weep for their loss. Because they see them as just things. Living growths previously inside of a person with the potential to become a person, but not yet a person.

Focus your energy on the lives of people who are people. Not growths that are quite possibly just tissue.

Romero - Solid back-up GK

Schneiderlin - Excellent defensive midfielder, already contributed to our season by helping the team towards 2 goals conceded in 4 matches

Schweinsteiger - Obviously a fabulous footballer but almost more importantly he brings experience to a changing room that has lost Evra, Rio Ferdinand, Vidic, Giggs, RVP etc over the last few seasons

Darmian - Settled in quickly and looks like a fabulous right back 

Memphis - Seen glimpses of what he can do but pretty inconsistent so far. Hoping he settles soon

Martial - Incredibly overpriced exciting youngster. Brings pace to our front line

Navas - If the DDG deal goes through then we get a very good GK back, although it is a downgrade

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I think the point is demonstrated in Hearthstone too. Piloted Shredder can be compared to Piloted Sky Golem. One sees tremendously more play than the other, because it's cheaper. They're about as efficient, but one is cheap. A good 4-drop will do more than a good 6-drop because turning the tempo is easier at that stage of the game.

To see play, expensive minions need huge impact. Ysera has barely seen any play in a long time (sees a little now, but only because of Dragon decks), Ragnaros has also steadily seen less and less play. These two cards were once considered the best expensive cards in the game.

So the huge stuff that has actually seen a lot of play are cards like Alexstrasza who can quickly make your enemy go from 30 health to 0 or save your own ass, Grommash, who can do 10-12 damage from nowhere, Antonidas, who will single handedly win the game a lot of the time if you get to play him.

These cards are often the cards you want to close out the game with. You don't just run one of these many cards because of stuff like removal, and how you want to increase the probability of having drawn one threat at turn ~8, and how one threat is rarely enough to win the game, but you still want each of them to a crapload of impact, or it's simply not worth running it.

This is exactly what's happening in Magic, just a bit less extreme. In Magic, you don't play something above like 6 mana unless you intend to win with that card.

That is why we don't see stuff such as Sneed's. It doesn't have huge impact a lot of the time and it can take several turns until the fact that it's not just a 5/7 (i.e. it dies and you get to attack with whatever minion popped out) *actually matters*.","1441066062"

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Okay, let me highlight the major points so we look at the whole picture:

You are being used as an emotional crutch by your mother.  She is actually not the mom right now, *you* are.  She is dependent on you to feel good about herself.  She has even gone so far to follow you wherever you move. 

She's angry that you can't help her the way she wants, yet when **she has a daughter who works in the health field** and doesn't help herself with the resources provided to her, then that's really not good.

You said she is good at making you feel bad.

You said you can give her a shirt, then she'll go and take your entire wardrobe.  This sounds like someone who doesn't respects your time or generosity.

From what I've read, it sounds like you have a narcissistic mother.  She might be depressed, and that may be true, but it sounds like she uses that as an excuse to manipulate you and take you for granted.  She doesn't want to see a therapist because why the hell would she?  She's got you under her thumb!  You answer all her calls, she comes over whenever she wants, you take pity on her, etc.

Go to /r/raisedbynarcissists.  It's an excellent community on Reddit.  Possibly the best one I've ever been a part of.  Look at the sources listed there, because from what you've written, major red flags have been popping up.

The problem is, there's no way for her to stop making you feel like shit.  *You* have to learn not to take what she says and does personally.  *You* are not responsible for your mother's well being.  

It's probably going to boil down to this:  You're going to have to come up with some pretty thick boundaries with your mom and lay down the law.  When she can come over and when she can't.  When she can call and when she can't.  And if she starts trying to make you feel like shit, then you just walk away.  This sounds cruel, but your story is parallel to what my mom has gone through with my narcissist grandma, and it's parallel to what my girlfriend currently goes through with her mom.

Please visit /r/raisedbynarcissists.  If your mom fits the bill (I'm guessing she will) then post there, and talk to people who go through what you're going through.  You are responsible for your emotional well-being, please take care of yourself.","1441066064"

2. Your statement doesn't refute mine at all. My point is that clearly the ship's priorities are not ""make sure they have good ice cream"", its ""protect summer""
3. You clearly didn't think this out. Since the ship wrote/negotiated the peace terms, and if it really WAS trying to save their ice cream from a fly-ridden future, clearly the ship was in a position where it could include a clause preventing ice cream from having flies, or even just omitting the entire food-equality portion altogether.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","If you're lifting for strength it is longer than 2 days, I don't mean to keep arguing but I want to stop the spread of misinformation. As a beginner, training your nervous system and forming neural engrams will always more than negate the effects of overtraining on your muscles in terms of strength gains. Every person is different and we don't have the infrastructure to collect much objective data when it comes to fitness. It's primarily trial based and subjective, which means a lot of uncontrollable variables but that doesn't mean there aren't some things we know as fact. Science based on subjective data has essentially proven (you can always argue correlation versus causation when studies are done the way were forced to) there's a lot of benefit from routine rest and deloading in strength training. Everybody is different, and we don't know why or how those differences affect us, but you're spreading bad information man. It takes longer than 48 hours to fully recover if you're lifting properly. And regardless of training type regular rest days are required for maximal growth. I suppose some other factor we haven't consider could make so nearly every subject has trial results that show that, but it's unlikely. I'll take some time to find sources if you'd really like but honestly it's common knowledge in the fitness industry. If you're strength training legs 3.5 days a week all year you're not doing things right. That's the nicest way I can put that. ","1441066066"

(b) We should be actively removing dams that are dangerous, abandoned, and/or produce such low amounts of energy that they are impractical.

My thoughts would be (if it is in as good of shape as he's stating) to buy it, throw a good paint job on it, fix whatever random bullshit needs to be done to it, drive it a while, then resell it after I lose interest in it. I already have a DD (05 GP GT) and a second car ('98 'bird) so this would actually be a third car to mess around in. Based on how much I drive my 'bird, I would probably only put about 500 miles/yr on it or so, so I'm not looking at a ton of maintenance as it wouldn't be a daily driver. 

So my main thing would be wanting to sell it for about what I buy it for, then the cost of owning it would be whatever maintenance/upkeep I do on it while I own it. That's the main reason I'm asking about the $4k asking price, as I would want to be able to sell it for that much down the line.","1441066076"

I think you have that backwards. Many game developers see 64-bit browsers (among other things) as a dependency to targeting the web as a platform. It's definitely a priority for Mozilla and will be coming much much sooner than 5-10 years.","1441066079"

"ModernMagic","t5_2xs5t","I live in a town with a lot of LGSes and a thriving Modern scene--there are Modern events that fire reliably every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (there are 2 Modern FNMs that fire every week), and one that sometimes fires on Sunday.  Each store has a local meta, but those metas are different between stores; for example, one store has 3-4 Burn players, while another only has 1.

In my experience, the best option is to play a deck that has a lot of even or near-even matches and very few bad ones.  I've played Living End, Infect, Pod (obviously not since January), RG Tron, Splinter Twin (both Izzet and Grixis), Jund, and Junk.  I've found that decks with both very good and very bad matchups (Tron, Infect, Living End, even Pod when RG Tron was popular) tend to get stomped when they hit a bad pairing.  More even decks are the ones that are most likely to beat any given room, because they aren't just crossing their fingers and hoping they never see a Vendilion Clique or a Leyline of the Void.

My advice is to pick a deck with at most 1 bad matchup, pack sideboard hate for that matchup, and then get really good at that deck.  Every deck like Tron is going to have a Junk matchup where it's hard to lose and an Infect matchup where it's almost impossible to win.

It's better to get really good at your 60% matchups than to pray you don't have to do a 25% matchup.","1441066079"

"Midair","t5_37zfa","Ratings based on roles is good, but I feel that there should be no role-matchmaking system such as in WoW or League of Legends.

It works for those games, as a more ""serious"" or ""competitive"" play scene is provided by a role-based queueing system.

However, I think in Tribes games, where PUGs have always existed and are always frequent if the game is ""popular"", a role system already exists in PUGs, where a more competitive atmosphere is formed.

Furthermore, the beauty of Tribes and Legions etc is that you can instantly change your class/role at any point in-game to adapt to the requirements of your team, whereas in games such as MOBAs, as soon as you pick a champion, you are locked in with that champion/role for the entire game.

I don't think this same restrictive role-based system should exists for PUBs.

Just my opinion :)","1441066082"

At the high end of the spectrum, a college degree offers a lot of value and is a solid investment.  At the low end, it's more about being employed than getting good employment.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","1.) Trading can happen til Week 8 of the season. General Free Agency starts at the beginning of the league year in March when contracts end, if a player is released before then they go through a waivers system where teams can pick them up.

2.) The league is split up into two conferences and 8 divisions, teams play their own division twice each year home and away and the rest of the schedule is based on a rotation of conference/divisions and two games based on where they finished the previous year, some teams might not play each other for almost 4 years.

3.) You can enter the draft three years after High School, most players play in College during that time. Players often retire in their early 30s but some are able to play much longer or if they play for the 49ers much shorter.

4.) Coaches. Coaches have a very important role during the game, much more important than most other sports. Yes, they set the rosters and practice and everything else, but they play a Chessmaster role to the pieces on the field during the game and decide what plays are going to be played. The Head Coach will often delegate some this roles to sub-coaches called Coordinators and they will pass on to their players what to play. Yes coaches can get fired in mid-season and the owners will put an interm-head coach until the end of the season. Usually coaches will be given 3-4 years to show a marked improvement before they move on to another.","1441066085"

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","ANSWER PART 2: I might be overly optimistic, but I genuinely feel that the overall geek culture is welcoming of people of all shapes, sizes, genders, creeds, etc. Many of us wound up here because we didn't identify well with dominant social groups. The nature of the culture, of us coming together for our own thing(s), means we are inherently accepting.

That said, there are definitely assholes in the mix. As I get older and continue to observe, I feel like the Internet gives the assholes such a powerful megaphone that their unaccepting attitudes are all we hear. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. 

I think geek culture can become more inclusive by positivity. Celebrate what people do. Show people that their various nerd flags are welcome in the kingdom. 

Feeding the trolls is an ongoing problem. These people want attention, both from the people they target and from the general nerd populace.

If you don't wanna play it day one, you don't have to. But now nobody gets to play it, at all. Until, well, ""whenever"".

That's kinda ridiculous to be honest.

I want games to be complete and to have choices, not to have the choices and content be taken away. And holding that content back, or it plain not being done (think this is the case) doesn't sound like something to be thanking people for.

Also where do all these ""2 weeks for finishing the story"" estimates coming from?

Did we play a different game? My version of the full game lasted about 8 hours from start to finish minus raids. Story for Crota's End, and House of Wolves was a few maybe 15 minute long missions.

Where is this expectation that it'll be weeks and weeks coming from? Did I miss something and they packed some 10 - 15 times the content in this DLC?

Whatever he did to her physically only happened after a lot of emotional abuse. Most of us approach relationships with a desire to please the other person and this is great when it is mutual. But in an abusive relationship, the abuser is not interested in reciprocating. They are only in it for their own desires so they undermine the other person's will. They twist everything so that they control everything.  The abused person loses the ability to even know what they want for themselves. Consent requires that you answer for yourself. In this situation, the OP would have said ""Yes."" every time, but the question she was answering was, ""Does your husband want this?"" Never ""Do you want this.""","1441066089"

***********************************************

This picture was #1 on the front page of /r/no_sob_story, and compare it with the highly-voted comments of other top posts linked in that sub:

25 days ago, [a photo of an EMT killed by a car](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3fzu6l/can_we_take_a_minute_to_remember_this_amazing_emt/) with a sob-story title:

&gt;Man smiling.

-

&gt;Photograph of an EMT.

-

&gt;/r/pics is oficially /r/sobstories

-

&gt;Can we take a moment to remember that I need karma?

-

&gt;Isn't this sub for posting pictures, not stories?

-

&gt;I guess r/pics has turned into Facebook now.

-

&gt;This does not belong in here. This has nothing to do with /r/pics

-

&gt;This might as well be a short story with a stock photo. This is /r/pics, not /r/sobstories.

-

&gt;Amateur post, OP. For max karma in r/pics you claim it's your relative that died. Try again in a few weeks when there's some other tragic death in the news.


5 days ago, [a photo of the two victims from the news station shooting](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3igtlt/whatever_you_hear_or_read_today_try_not_to_learn/) with a cliche title:

&gt;I don't care what the topic is; you're promoting willful ignorance.

-

&gt;Oh Jesus, shut the fuck up, OP. Way to use their deaths to make a karma grab. What's more, this isn't even the sub for this.

-

&gt;Agreed. Fuck off OP you cunt.

-

&gt;hmm... that was fast.

&gt;shit people do for karma

-

&gt;Fuck you OP

-

&gt;Also don't upvote all the karma whoring posts like these.

-

&gt;Wow, this is some quick thinking karma whoring right here. Good job.

-

&gt;This is really the most fucking garbage post I have ever seen/read and whoever made it is the largest cunt ever trying to benefit from this you absolute cunt of a human

*******************************

So, from all this we could maybe compare to other posts that *didn't* have such comments and conclude reddit hates EMTs and straight, white people, or conclude that reddit gets super angry when it detects a sob story title. I know these aren't 100% comparable because they involve a story about someone else rather than OP himself, but just check the 'top' tabs of /r/no_sob_story or /r/shitpost and you will find literally hundreds of comments sections identical to this criticizing perceived 'karma whores' and 'attention whores'.

"HearthArena","t5_35cv7","I agree with you on Shadowfiend, Refreshement Vendor, Powermace and Elemental Destruction (maybe if your deck is so crazy with overload that you can reliably get 4+ buffs on the Elemenental, but that's basically impossible). For me the jury is still out on Northsea Kraken - sometimes it's a huge swing, but other times it just clogs up your hand for too long, and by the time you can play it the opponent is able to flood the board and push face in response. 

I see your point on the RNG element of Spellslinger introducing a dangerously high variance for infinite players, but I strongly disagree that it's a bad card overall, or that the ""both players gain fireball"" version would be terrible. 

I think, if anything, the meta is moving from Mage&gt;Paladin&gt;Rogue to something more like Paladin&gt;Rogue&gt;Mage, so Kezan (and Flare) are getting less valuable, not more. Mage secrets are the most valuable/powerful, and they're becoming less common in TGT. ","1441066089"

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","For dates, *especially* **first** dates, you want to be able to talk to see, hear, and talk to each other. Movies and concerts have always only ever been terrible, in my experience. At the movies, and moreso at a movie you actually want to see, you're paying too much attention to the movie itself which almost entirely defeats the purpose of going out on a date with a person you really like.

It just doesn't allow for good good first-date chemistry. If you're alone in the theater you can talk and laugh and fool around without being a disruption to other paying patrons.

If you invite someone over for a movie... okay, this CAN have some romantic potential if you do it right. But doing it right would not be ""Netflix &amp; chill."" Saying that would literally be the same as saying ""Wanna come over and put on noise to hide doing sex stuff?""

If you really just wanna watch a movie, first things first: 

* make it a good one. Either a romantic comedy or something dramatic that'll be somewhat likely to make her and possibly even yourself at least get teary-eyed.
* don't make the movie the only thing worth showing up for. you buy popcorn and candy and drinks at the theater, right? cook for her. it doesn't have to be anything extravagant. it could be as simple as macaroni and cheese or frozen pizza. it just shows effort. but try to make it something she'll like.
* don't do anything overly hokey like rose petals - that's like anniversary / proposal stuff, but you want the place to look nice. If it's your room, wash your sheets and make your bad. wherever it is, light incense or scented candles before she gets there. let those aromas fill up your space pretty much all day - but choose one or the other / don't overdo it. They should be close to burning out by the time she arrives, rather than barely lit. Most of the scent comes from the smoke rather than the burning. Avoid anything electric or chemical, like sprays glade plug-ins. Non-aerosol Febreeze is good but only for light stuff, like if you have a pet that lays in a particular spot.
* lighting - christmas lights are pretty cool, and you can probably find them in stock around this time at a fair price technically being out of season but up&amp;coming. If not, rope-lights are second-best. They're safer than littering candles all over the place and offer a comforting light to see around but still dim enough to 'set the mood'.

Lastly, you should pretty much treat the area you set up like an actual place. Not just your home. Again, especially if this is a first date. After all, you want there to be a second. And a third. Etc. What I mean is, when you're done making your pizza or whatever, don't leave the box lying around. Keep that shit tidy as you go. It'll be less to worry about when the date's over anyway - but with any luck that won't be until the light starts showing up the morning after.","1441066089"

Responding to black lives matter with all lives matter is fucking obtuse. It's like that stupid response ""I think the government should get out of all marriage."" It's just dodging the point. The question is not ""should government be involved in marriage""? The question is ""should two consenting gay adults be able to marry?""

There are things Clark got away with that Key never would have - for example, all that crap about her husband and their fairly shammish marriage.

I don't like the way this piece suggests that only women suffer from sexism. Sure, I think we probably suffer more (particularly in make dominated areas like politics), but we also get a lot of leeway in areas that men don't.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","&gt;My hands arent fast enough for insane tech skill

While I understand where you're coming from, this is not an issue that can't be fixed. Pretty much everyone you see topping tournament rankings started out with sluggish reflexes and fingers that can't do simple tech, it's just that these players put the time into fixing that. Some people got their hands into shape when they were younger and played casual-competitive (1v1 no items at friend's houses), while others built it during tournaments and dedicated training sessions. Nobody picked up the controller for the first time being able to do perfect wavedashes and shffls after 15 minutes of lab time. 

Pretty much every character in P:M and Melee require ""fast hands"" to play at any reasonably decent level. If you can't get your character from Point A to Point B quickly and consistently, you will be absolutely destroyed by the people who can. It doesn't matter how smart you are or how well you know the matchup; Tight, consistent, and effective movement is 100% the most important thing you need to compete in any smash game (even Smash 64, Brawl, or Smash 4).

That being said, there are some characters that make learning tech easier than others. Falco and Marth are characters with *very* lenient input windows for their tech, allowing you to perform most tech decently well without having to nail it down 100%. Marth teaches you how to move on the ground with his ridiculously large dash dance window and wavedash, giving you the option to take to the skies with L-canceled aerials at your own pace. Falco teaches you the benefits of shorthopping, with a generous short hop window of 4 frames (twice as many as Fox!) and very obvious L-cancel timings. He also teaches you the basics of the shine, which also has very lenient timing windows when compared to fox.

Don't give up hope. For every wavedash or L-cancel you miss at the beginning, you will do 200 perfect ones once you get the hang of it. I guarantee it.","1441066096"

I'll try to comment back later tonight with a summary for each of Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fuji, Pentax, and M43.

PS. If you are starting, I highly recommend a decent, perhaps older camera body with ideally a fast prime normal lens (kit zoom is okay barring that) and renting lenses to get a feel for what kinds of photography and lenses you like.","1441066098"

"Rockband","t5_2qifr","You're failing to realize that the controllers offer countless combinations that HMX can use. The following applies on Xbox 360, but I assume the setup is similar on Xbox One as far as what HMX has access to. 

On the Rock Band drums, when you hit the kick pedal, the Xbox gets ""LeftShoulder"", and RB3 interprets that as a kick pedal. 

When you hit the snare, the Xbox gets ""LeftThumb + B"" (i.e. combination of both of those buttons at once) and RB3 takes that and makes it be a snare. 

You want more complex? OK. Closed Hi-Hat (i.e. having the left pedal down + hitting the yellow cymbal) registers on the Xbox as ""DPadUp + LeftThumb + RightShoulder + Y""...and what does RB3 do with that? If you're in Freestyle Mode with HiHat enabled = you get a hi-hat sound. 

You want another example? Ok. On the RB3 keytar, the 25 keys send to the Xbox varying byte values for LeftTrigger, RightTrigger and LeftThumbX...and just by varying those values, RB3 interprets the result as one of the 25 different keys.

The point is yes, HMX can change what pressing that button sends to the PS4 or the Xbox One, and they can equally change how RB4 interprets that signal. So the old system was pressing Back meant overdrive. If there is no Back button (or PS4's Select equivalent?), they can change it so when you press that button the PS4 registers LeftThumbX = 5 and RightThumbX = 5 and make RB4 interpret *that* to be overdrive activation.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Those figures sound about right.

Now, I can't stress the following enough;

 * Set realistic goals
 * Work on your willpower
 * Collect data for feedback
 * If something isn't working, change it

If you are dead set on achieving your goal of 90-95 lbs, then you're going to have to set goals in between and realise that it's not going to happen quickly, if you want realistic figures plan for 2-3 years. I'd strongly suggest maintaining a spreadsheet with your weight. You need feedback to get a good idea of whether what you are doing is working or not.

Exercise for fitness, don't worry about it for weight loss. I'm not saying don't exercise, just separate the two from each other. The only thing you need to concentrate on for weight loss is your diet. If you don't fix that up, nothing else will.

Calorie counting is critical at the start, you need to get a decent idea of how much you actually need to eat. Once you've done that for a while, and trained it into you, then calorie counting won't be as critical. I had to work on mental things with respect to willpower and framing things in such a way to really present a dichotomy. Basically if you look at some food which you shouldn't be eating, yes you can eat it, but realise that it's setting you back, so how badly do you want it? What do you want more? Slender figure or that piece of food?

On the topic of food, it's also worthwhile to research which foods are better to eat, not because they're necessarily healthier, but things like sugar, to some extent carbohydrates as well, they're very easy to overeat. If you work on eating leafy vegetables instead, and make them your staple, then you will generally eat normal quantities of food, without the energy intake. At the end of the day calories in must be lower than calories out, but working on a strategy to eat foods which allow you to feel full without hitting your calorie limit will help.

Last thing is, I would suggest against going on a crash diet. All it will do is get you down to a weight you're happy with, and return to bad habits, only to see all the weight come back. If you want to get down to your goal weight, then you need a lifestyle change, meaning your diet must reflect that weight. Obviously, once you hit that weight, your diet can't change, or else the weight will just come back.

Good luck!","1441066100"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I think the show did a disservice to Sansa by implying in Season 4 that she would be turning into a badass, and then comes Season 5 and we see Sansa become a victim in need of saving, yet again. It looked as if she had learnt absolutely nothing from her time at Kings Landing.

When Tyrion marries her he is able to see her weapon and that is her courtesy, it is her shield and her strength and it almost undoes him. One of the smartest characters in the series is almost undone by what others perceive as a 'silly stupid girl'. And another weapon which I am sure she will use is to allow others to underestimate her, this will work to her advantage as her character beings to grow and develop.

During the Battle of Blackwater it is Sansa who gives courage to the women and by watching Cersei she learns and thinks, 'If I am ever queen, I'll make them love me.' She recognises that though Cersei may be queen she is *not* loved and to rule by fear alone is *dangerous*as when the crowds turned on the Royal family. Sansa learns an important lesson from watching Cersei, how *not* to behave as queen.

Later she tries to warn Margaery, but Margaery feels a false sense of security because her brother Loras is a kingsguard. Sansa then thinks 'The Realm may have a second Kingslayer, &amp; there would be war inside the city, as the men of the lion &amp; the men of the rose made the gutters run red....Sansa was surprised that Margaery did not see it too.'

If Margaery had listened to Sansa it may have saved her a great deal of anguish. But this shows how much Sansa has grown, she *knows* her enemy and their strengths and weaknesses, while Margaery seems blind and walks straight into danger.

The difference between Arya and Sansa is one plays out her rage externally, while the other does so internally; this may be problematic in trying to portray Sansa's hidden strengths as powerful and it may be here where Dan &amp; Dave stumble.

But I'm hoping that they will do better portraying Sansa in Season 6.

Exactly my point, it was quite specific and correct.

Very true, except I was downvoted and 'refuted' by a few people long before I put any emotion in my words.

**Intro**

Failure is a Multiplayer / Single Player RTS with elements of card battle games such as Hearthstone and tower defence games such as Defence Grid set in a digital network called The NeuroNet. 

The game pits players against each other using decks of scripts built by the players consisting of Constructs, our game's version of buildings, and unique hacking abilities we call Functions. Current planned features of the game include:

* Persistent Narrative Driven Online Multiplayer and Singleplayer
* 10+ Construct (Building) types, each with their own unique unit types
* Expansive upgrade system for Constructs and units
* 18+ Function (Player Hacking abilities) types allowing you to manipulate the levels in interesting ways
* Unique upgrade system for Functions that takes ideas from card collecting games and deeply expands on it with the Compiler system
* Faction / Corporation Warfare system - An ever changing landscape within the NeuroNet bringing new challenges and rewards to players
* Puzzle based Single player levels to test your tactical and logical prowess
* Co-operative play and Boss battles!
* Built in tournament matchmaking system for highly competitive games

For additional details about the game head over to our [press page](http://dreamharvest.co.uk/Press/sheet.php?p=failure)


**We Need Your Help**

We've been slowly building our community and interest around Failure and so we have decided to launch a brand new Newsletter that will allow players to learn more about the game in the run up to our Kickstarter campaign, release and beyond.

* Early Concept Art
* Video Dev Blogs 
* Competitions
* Closer Looks at the game mechanics
* Interviews with the developers
* Much much more!

We need your help to spread the word about the Newsletter via our [Thunderclap campaign](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/30743-failure-game-newsletter?locale=en).

&gt; I am not assuming you are an idiot. I am assuming you don't know what the word 'cogent' means, because you used it wrong. And because you used it wrong, I really have two options that I have to chose from when interpreting your mis-use (i) you knowingly used it wrong or (ii) you didn't knowingly use it wrong (i.e., you didn't know what it meant). The latter seems like the better assumption to me. Just because you don't know the definition of word, doesn't mean you are an idiot: it means you don't know the definition of a word. It is that simple.

And you are *wrong*.

You were *not* clear, logical, or convincing in your conspiracy theory or your ad hominem attacks on a person because it had nothing to do with arguments that the person made.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Wow, that was like when he first started writing them, too! I only started reading them back in middle school, so, early 2000ish?

**And definitely those lore ones are references!** There's a ton. In fact, one of the reasons I cemented my reason to buy Destiny was because of one of the references. (Well, I've been a longtime fan of Bungie since I played Marathon as a kid and I freakin' grew up on Halo... so I was probably going to get it regardless lol).

Anyway, when the beta for Destiny was ending, and people started complaining about not being able to carry over their Guardian to the final version, they threatened to not get the game at all. And one of the devs responded with:

&gt;*""Go then, there are other worlds than these.""*

I want to say it was a verbatim tweet - but in [this Weekly Update just over a year ago now,](https://www.bungie.net/7_Bungie-Weekly-Update---08082014/en/News/News?aid=12034) they say 'there are other worlds than these' as part of the headline down the page.

If you read the grimoire for Thorn, [where it mentions 'The Rose',](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/2g3zd2/possible_dt_influence_in_new_video_game_destiny/) there's almost certainly parallels to the Dark Tower. Much the same with the Last Word's story.

The Black Garden, *a nexus between realities*, in game rests in a field of red flowers - roses, do ya ken? And in the Mars Ride-Along, they say beams - *Beams* - of data radiate to the Black Garden like spokes on a wheel.

The Garden's grimoire card almost reads as if the narrator went todash to get there, too.

The Crucible medal ""The Way of the Gun"" - for killing three enemies (or more) with each Golden Gun use - usually meaning you never miss a shot, you never forget the face of your father.

There's a couple instances of 19 in the game's campaign, too, which could totally be random, but I mean like, if they were random why wouldn't they choose some other number? lol.

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","Also, for those who don't know, Nova Scotia has gasoline price regulation.  This means that every week, the price of gasoline is fixed.  However, when the price changes by more than 6 cents a liter (~25 c/US gallon) in either direction, the price resets immediately.

Just before the shortage materialized, the price dropped by ~6 cents, which leads people to fill their tanks.  People here (I am a Nova Scotian) are weird about it.  People think nothing of spending $2 on a coffee, but when they get the opportunity to save $2 on a tank of gas...  So that, in conjunction with a big driving weekend (last week before labour day) caused a large increase in demand.

The province has had minor shortages that were just caused by consumer behavior.  For example, a couple years ago there was an AC/DC concert in Moncton, about 260 km from Halifax (where ~40% of Nova Scotia lives), that caused most of the gas stations on the road between Halifax and Moncton to run dry.","1441066109"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;A lot of ""Christians"" in our time don't read their bibles but 100 years ago everyone read the Bible front front to back and a hundred years before that and before that. 

You're actually factually incorrect. Long before literacy boomed, and before there was a comprehensive edition version released (because the ultimate word of an omnipotent deity needs help, lol), NO one read the bible. It was pastors' and priests' jobs to read it to their congregation. Oh, I'm certain that every Christian had a few favorite bits they memorized, but read it front to back? Fuck no, perhaps you should do some more research into the history of literacy and theology. 

&gt;A lot of the smartest men who walked this earth, men a lotg smarter than me or you believed in the Bible. 

It was basically a given to act as though you were part of the dominant religion, or you'd be treated as a social pariah. A lot of the smartest men who walked this earth, men a lot smarter than me or you DIDN'T believe in the bible, or believed in the Torah, or believed in the Koran. Your argument doesn't make any sense, it's an appeal to authority(intelligence). Being a generally smart person and believing in the bible doesn't mean the bible's suddenly an amazing collection of books. It's possible for ""smart men"" to be wrong. 

&gt;If the stories in the Bible were not interesting and just plain terrible then no one would read it but it isn't. 

Oh yeah, *Deuteronomy* is *soooo* exciting. People read the bible because it's part of their belief, because it's part of their culture, because of the lessons it teaches, and because they do genuinely enjoy some of the stories. Still doesn't mean the stories are actually **quality**. When analyzed at all, they're patently absurd. 

&gt;(Various stories.) 

Yes, I'm familiar with them, I grew up on kid versions of them because of my father. They were trash. I recently decided to learn more about the bible, and my mind hadn't been changed. Still trash. In fact, I was able to better *understand* the reasons why they were so bad, because I was more developed as a person. Do they have some good lessons to teach? Obviously. But they're still loaded to the heaping brim with negatives that far outweigh the positives. 

&gt;These are great stories and the stories influenced a lot of the greatest books and art in the world. 

Yup. *Being a dominant religion does that.* 

&gt;I also don't understand why you brung up Twilight, a book that was popular among teen girls who I'm sure didn't believe in the book. And who is talking about Twilight anymore. Like I said I don't believe in the Bible but if you look at it from a literary point of view, it's really good. 

You said that it must be good because of how popular it is. I presented an example of *argumentum ad populum*. 

&gt;It's so good that people believe it. 

No. People believe it because they're already Christians, and have a confirmation bias towards accepting it. ","1441066109"

Nobody is throwing fire bombs there. At most they are tossing *back* the gas canisters shot at the by the occupation forces. As I said, any protest met with violence by security forces is bound to turn violent from the protesters' side. 

&gt;Good, so you admit they were acting as combatants and therefore were not the ""victims."" Just because you think their violence was justified does not mean you can say they were being ""non violent.""

Pulling someone's arm against his will is an act of violence, but it would be absurd to define someone as a ""combatant"" because of that. That's some wild twisting of the rules of war. They were just a bunch of concerned villagers taking a grown man off a child with just the necessary amount of force. No punches, no kicks, no beating.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","""Naomi Klein keeps coming up with fresh new ideas about how to spark an elusive mass social movement against capitalism and corporations. In her 2000 bestseller No Logo, the progressive journalist attempted to harness the nascent anti-globalization movement to unleash ""a vast wave of opposition squarely targeting transnational corporations."" In 2007, her book The Shock Doctrine bogusly asserted that free market institutions spread only by taking advantage of coups, wars, and natural calamities. The book debuted at the beginning of a massive recession and featured economist Milton Friedman as its chief villain. But still no dice.

Now comes Klein's newest screed, This Changes Everything. ""Our economic system and our planetary system are now at war,"" she asserts

She wants to ban fracking, nuclear power, genetically modified crops, geoengineering, carbon sequestration, and carbon markets, thus turning her back on some of the climate-friendliest solutions currently on offer""

We need a Marshall Plan for the Earth,"" Klein declares, updating one of the most tired historical metaphors for her purposes. ""It is entirely possible to rapidly switch our energy systems to 100 percent renewables,"" she asserts...Sound easy? Well, if the world were to begin deploying these renewable energy technologies next year that would mean erecting approximately 250,000 wind turbines each year for the next 15 years. As of the end of 2012, there were a total of 225,000 wind turbines operating around the world.Similarly, the world would have to install 113 million rooftop solar panel systems per year in order to meet the 2030 goal of 1.7 billion. Klein never ever discusses how much her solutions to the climate crisis will cost. But Delucchi and Jacobson estimate a price tag of about $100 trillion for their program. That entails spending about $6.6 trillion per year from now until 2030, more than 11 percent of the entire world's 2013 output of $75 trillion""

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Maybe these old white men are the last vestiges of real men versus the metrosexual males of today. You know, the liberals ones who shy away from military service and wish the perfect life be handed to them on a silver platter.

The tales of the next generation being a sorry lot have roots all the way back to Greek times. As for military service, do you suggest that everybody should serve in the military? At first I thought you were referring to draft dodging, but since we haven't had a draft lately... I guess you mean that people need to join the military to be worth their salt.

I'd like to offer an alternative explanation. Millennials are tired of war. We've grown up in a time that wages have stagnated, well-paying factory jobs have shipped overseas, and student debt has exploded. The last thing we want is to keep shoveling our money into trillion dollar wars and a wasteful military. I don't expect Boomers to get it because they were raised during a time of economic growth, where you could pay off college with a summer job or even just say to hell with college and get a decent paying factory job. Fast forward today and the largest employer is Walmart rather than GM, you more or less require a solid education to get a decent paying job, and wages have stagnated for 40 years as we have deregulated our economy and allowed for an explosion in wealth inequality all while living costs have continued to accelerate.

As for old white men, you are the one that brought them up in the first place and I merely responded to that. I am scratching my head why you appear to consider the Republican party the party of acceptance when the last Democratic primary was between a black man and a woman, when this primary's front-runner is a woman, and when virtually every minority in America votes democrat.","1441066118"

Look I like Rogan and he definitely HAS THE RESUME to warrant a more respected and valued opinion than the average fan. But his opinion on any matter does not make it more credible than any other person's.

When Rogan is giving you numbers like ""You won this many fights all of them ending blah blah blah"" then yeah that's fact. But when he's giving you stuff like ""I Think you're great, your speed is retarded"" just take into account Rogan's just a guy who expresses a lot of his words strongly.

"steak","t5_2qmha","Absolutely this.  Not only is it capable of producing perfectly-cooked steaks, it has great gadget appeal and fits within your budget.

If you're not familiar, a sous vide is designed to heat water to a very precise temperature (like, to tenths of a degree) and circulate it around a cooking vessel in which you've placed a vacuum-sealed pouch of your raw meat.  So if you want a medium-rare steak you need an internal temperature of 135º... just set the sous vide to 135 and drop the meat in for an hour or two.  It will cook the steak medium rare the whole way through, then you throw it on your skillet for a few seconds to get a good seared crust.  Cooking this way, you get the steak cooked edge-to-edge at the exact level of doneness you prefer.  No ""medium rare center with bands of progressively more well-done meat as you make your way to the edge"".


I have an older version of the Anova Sous Vide and it's rad.

Not for fucking mussels. Remember those byssal threads I mentioned? When mussels sense a whelk has come into their little group, they spray byssal threads all over the whelk. This effectively traps the whelk in place since they're not strong enough to break the threads. As such, the whelk sits there, tied down, until it fucking starves to death.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","A good rule of thumb is to never stop too close to the vehicle in front of you, lest you see some asshole coming up to the light that appears they may not be able to stop in time. Unless I'm in one of the middle lanes, I always give myself enough room to turn the wheel quickly and get out of the lane of traffic. I've avoided quite a few rear end collisions this way. If you put it in neutral or turn off the engine you will not have enough reaction time to do so. 

You will probably never see enough in gas savings to even measure it, but you can avoid some time consuming repairs and headaches if you can get out of the way of the asshole that's not paying attention at the light. 

You probably won't see any measurable benefit unless the idle period is longer than a minute or two. Besides, where I'm from, it's HOT, and turning off the engine also means that the car turns into an oven in just a few seconds. A small hit on mileage is worth the comfort of keeping the A/C going.

At this point I think I associate being ""foreveralone"" with being isolated in general, including from female friends, something I had a small number of but as I age that number dwindles to zero because they have enough friends, SOs, and worries to occupy their time and emotional energy.  I could be wrong. 

Just because you learn from others and adapt based on others' interests doesn't mean that new growth is artificial. I've learned alot from friends that eventually drifted away or made it clear I wasn't nearly as important to them as they were to me. ","1441066121"

"samharris","t5_2thqg","&gt;That is an attempt to argue a fallacy

It is not.  You can tell I am not trying to call it a fallacy, because I didn't call it a fallacy.  

You are, of course, free to insert words into my mouth, but that doesn't make it true.  I did not use 'fallacy' and I did not use it on purpose.  

You will notice I was not claiming he was wrong (which is what the fallacy implies), rather, I was stating that there was a claim of logic, without support for that claim.

That is *not* a fallacy.  Specifically, it is not a mistaken belief on my part, because (and this is critical) no support for the claim of logic was given -- which was my only accusation.

Perhaps you can try to demonstrate how pointing out a lack of support equates with a fallacy?

&gt;At this point, I must reiterate, what exactly was wrong with his arguments?

Did I say he was wrong?  I said: he claimed logical arguments, without a demonstration of why those arguments were logical. 

That is not the same as saying he is wrong.  In fact, even if his arguments *were illogical*  (again, I am not even claiming *that*), then the conclusion of his argument could be correct.

I made no claim as to the truth or falseness of his arguments.  I made a claim that his claim for logical arguments was not supported. ","1441066121"

Think about what kinds of things you'd describe when you're trying to describe a natlang (natural language)--you're going to have to describe the same things when it comes to a conlang.

Most (not all) conlangers start with phonology, come up with a basic sketch of morphology and syntax, then start translating stuff to flesh things out, starting with simple sentences and building up to the complex stuff. If you do conworlding, you probably will do the two simultaneously, as they do affect one another. (a non-human species could have drastically different phonology, for example, or if the culture places some importance on the number twelve, maybe they have a base-twelve number system)

You might be interested in the [Zompist bulletin board](http://incatena.org)  (the ZBB)--it's one of the more ""technical"" of the various conlang communities, but if you already have a grounding in linguistics, you'll probably be able to jump in and understand most of what's being discussed there.

&gt;On May 9, 1991, Hearn became the third broadcaster to be inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts.[9] In 1995, he was voted to be the 20th member of the American Sportscaster Hall of Fame by his fellow sportscasters. He was inducted by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 1997.

&gt;In honor of his contributions to the Los Angeles Lakers, both the Lakers and the city of Los Angeles renamed a portion of West 11th Street between Figueroa Street and Georgia Street (now L.A. Live Way) to Chick Hearn Court. This street currently runs alongside Staples Center's main entrance. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority further honored the broadcaster by changing the name of the nearby Blue Line station to Pico-Chick Hearn (this name change has since been reverted). His name was later hung from the rafters of the Staples Center, alongside the retired numbers of past Lakers players, though with a microphone in place of a number.

&gt;Hearn also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in radio. Hearn's star is located at 6755 Hollywood Blvd.

&gt;On April 27, 2010, Chick Hearn was honored with a bronze statue at Star Plaza outside Staples Center.[10] A chair next to Hearn's statue behind the desk with the Lakers' logo is a part of the statue so his fans can sit down to have their pictures taken.

lmao it doesn't work that way. i've gotten ""YOU'VE BEEN REPORTED FOR NEGATIVE ATTITUDE"" and ""YOU'VE BEEN REPORTED FOR VERBAL ABUSE"" before and i haven't been banned. why? because i barely say anything in chat, and if i do, the majority of it isn't toxic. if you're getting a 14 day ban for ingame behavior, chances are is you're a piece of shit. 14 day bans are for SERIOUS offenders afair; otherwise you'd be getting a chat restriction and that's the end of that.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","hey mate,

well as far i thought also the same like you :D, i did begin at may 15 and its also my first moba. 

when you have a good amount of champions you will face a wall, where you want to play other champs too (mostly the 6300 champs) And you dont know when they will be f2p. When you reach lvl 30 you need 15 champs that you own to play ranks, otherwise you are not allowed to enter the que. 

Also you NEED runes because they make your jungle and generally your last hitting better. if you just use standard rune pages you need around 16k IP (AD+AP runes) which is a lot. if you think about how many champs you need (16 it was) 7650 ip since you get 3 champs + skins for free. 23650 ip for just playing ranks after you hit lvl 30, and its just the 450ip champs + 2x1350 ip champs. if you want to buy another one it will be much harder to get the ip.

We all want to have all champs ofc because we like it to have a big champ pool, and soon you will realize it too that you want to play other champs just because you saw some videos/lcs/soon worlds and then you will feel the ""elo ip hell""


all 450 ip champs + the 3 free champs you will cover


3x top champs
1x mid lane
4x jungle
3x adcs
2x sups (+1 since annie can be played as sup too)

as far you dont need other adcs since the 3 ADC's you get are all top ADC's (ashe sivir tristana)
but for sup you just have alistar and soraka (which isnt so fun to play tbh)


like you can see you have only 1 mid laner AND if someone picks you that champ away you have nothing good to pick. ","1441066128"

I think we would be better as friends"" text.   It has gotten very close to incredibly infuriating.  In two years I have not had a ""relationship"" be longer than one to two months, needless to say my balls are BLUE!  
Anyway, I had gotten it in my head that me being somewhat voluntarily celibate was a huge turn off, that no woman wants the pressure of being a guys first.  That there is way too much pressure and that there is no fun in fucking someone who doesn't know what they are doing.  Finding this post late last night reminded me that there was in fact a reason that i have been keeping my dick in my pants all these years.  Thank you Eve, and to all the mysterious sex goddesses of GWA.","1441066128"

"Gamingcirclejerk","t5_2sf2b","&gt; I think it's more indicative of the demographic shift games have been undergoing. Most people who play games don't care about Nintendo Power (RIP), /r/games, rockpapershotgun, whatever. They just get what is cool to them and play that. See: CoD, sports games, etc. That isn't to knock those games, but I think gaming is undergoing the same thing that every other form of media has undergone. Once an entertainment medium is 'mainstream' you see lots more things that appeal to the mainstream do super well. But the folks who are routinely on places like /r/games are not so much that same mainstream necessarily, and so what is a 'bad game' to us doesn't read that way to the majority of the consumer base.

If you do not yet have a patent, but are patent pending, you will also have pretty much all the same protections, **sort of.** That is, if you are awarded the patent, your priority filing date is what is used to determine damages, and that priority date is before your intent to sell it. If you have an intent to sell(and you actually say you are going to sell) before you file for the patent, you are much less likely to get the patent.

Especially you being a medic, you would think it would be a high priority for them to guarantee that you all sufficiently retain your training and be able to perform over and over again on tests designed for medics. But like you mentioned, it is highly unlikely that any of you will even see action at all, aside from a possible terrorist attack, but even then you will need to put your training to the test in order to save lives. Not that it matters, but I don't think any branch of the US military would ever allow any recruits/soldiers to progress without making sure they can all perform their duties so well that they can do them in their sleep...

As for your language skills... I mean damn. Four languages, and you're already more well spoken in English than a lot of naturally born American citizens I know haha. I commend you Europeans for making the effort to learn so many world languages. And I definitely understand that English is one of the hardest languages to learn. In America, there are some southern states/high schools that have at least one or two years of mandatory Spanish, but most of us forget a good portion of what we learned haha. I can understand a lot when someone speaks in Spanish to me, but I have a terrible time trying to speak back to them. There are usually French classes in many high schools as well, but never mandatory. Spanish makes sense considering like half of the south (I'm in Texas) borders Mexico. I'm sure most of Eastern Canada has to learn French though. Anyway, I appreciate your quality response and good luck in the future. Maybe come visit us in the US sometime friend!

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Omg I've struggled to find bras for years that  fit comfortably, gave a light lift but also didn't poke or hurt me with their bands. 

I've always worn sports bras at work and in general because they gave just the most consistent cupping (Victoria secret measured me at  a D cup as that was from where my breasts began at, 34 was my torso but cup wise I mainly was an A filling potential) 

My sis started working out and has gotten a lot of Under Armor stuff and offered for me to try a few and their low impact bras are the only bras I wear now!

-They're seamless (so not obvious if you are wearing under clothes) as well as that means they don't have a specific band that is cutting off circulation anywhere

-they give a lift (as you can tell from the pictures, they do lightly lift for cleavage without compromising shape or fillers

- gives a gentle snug fit all around that also doesn't contort your back or shoulders with bad support or strap digging

-breathable comfortable fabric and feel

-since there is no padding there hasn't been any wierd shapes or deformations over time


As someone who prefers a low maintenance life style there were such an easy solution to my wide range of bra comforts before. I got a bunch of these in different colors and wear them

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","Harper has done a really good job of keeping the various wings of the party together without getting at each other's throats. This is not a simple task, keeping the social, fiscal and more libertarian sects within the party is an extremely difficult task. We also haven't seen any power struggles like the Chretien / Martin issues the Liberals went through.

When he is gone I honestly worry that the CPC will go down a path that I won't be able to follow (ie more socially conservative as opposed to fiscally). So in that he has been successful. 

Harper's biggest weakness in my opinion is that the party under him can sometimes lack vision. His breed of incrementalism can sometimes be so painfully slow that you wonder if there are any longer term goals. Granted, Mulroney boldly tried to take on the day's tough issues and we all know how that worked out so who knows if a conservative party could survive in power as long as it has if he hadn't done that.

Another thing that I don't like about Harper is that his lack of charisma really does hurt us. I'm not suggesting we go for a charismatic salesman like Trudeau, but Harper hasn't been able to breathe life into the party in the same way a more charismatic and energetic leader might be able to. I'm not sure if this is limited to Harper or conservatism in general but it is very often a struggle to be a conservative, especially a young one. It's not 'cool' to be a conservative, and people generally make all kinds of negative judgments about you that I think would be a challenge for someone on less ideologically firm footing to handle. Sometimes I feel like when politics are discussed with people in social situations I spend the entire time convincing people I'm not a lizard person. Right now I think his personal popularity is getting in the way. There are so many people that have conservative beliefs that claim to hate the CPC because they hate Harper. It is so incredibly frustrating to have people agree with your points of view, but completely disagree when you add party labels because of how much they hate Harper yet this is something I find happens very often.

On the whole I do have a huge amount of respect for Harper and what he has done for conservatism in Canada. He united the right under the CPC, and has managed to stay in power for this long implementing policies that I generally agree with. He's made Canada a more fiscally conservative place, though the roots were certainly there already. Some of this could definitely be a natural consequence of having power for almost 10 years in the modern world, and I honestly think after he's gone people will think of him in a much more flattering light than they do now.","1441066132"

In doing bite work, we teach the dog that hitting or striking the dog or the handler is its sole command to bite.  We use the bond between a dog and handler to bring out the protective instinct.  

The beginning steps of bite work is what we called ""circle agitation"".  Place experienced dogs between the new dogs and then work on petting then striking the dog to get them to bite a rag or sleeve.  It is awesome to see a timid dog figure out that he has power to protect himself and his handler. Never once do we back them down.

Like fuck, did you see straight outta compton? Notice in the news clips it was only showing clips of the media reporting on how dangerous the music was and it's association with violence.

Also, I don't expect someone to be good at the game because they have hats. I expect them to be sentient. As in, able to comprehend something simple like ""I should heal this guy"". I even ASKED HIM TO HEAL ME and he didn't respond to that. I just remembered that I actually did that. I said ""Medic overheal plz"" and he didn't do anything. He even looked at me. 

I was mad because he knew what he was fucking doing at the time. A Medic's first instinct, especially in setup (I also couldn't help but notice you apparently didn't read my other post since I even SAID it was during setup and he already had Uber), should be to try and make everyone overhealed and then go with their pocket. Was I misinformed? Is that not the case? Is a Medic not supposed to use their Medigun to heal everyone else when there's **nothing** else to do?

"Games","t5_2qhwp","A lot of hate on r/games for Destiny so I'll give a run down from a day 1 player.    
I pre-ordered this game after buying into all the hype, my friends and I were convinced this was going to be the best game ever.    
Beta was pretty solid and enjoyed it a lot.     
Game comes out and it it's pretty fucking awesome. The game play itself is fantastic BUT there just wasn't much of it. Once you finished the very story main story you had Crucible (PvP), strikes (3 man missions) and a raid (6 man mission).      
Crucible is really fun but the rewards were awful (has been fixed now) and the servers were bullshit (still aren't great).     
There were only a few strikes and they get super repetitive.     
Raid was awesome but the rewards were bullshit (fixed) but again, gets repetitive.     
So I took a break before the first expansion, when that came out it was more of the same but they were slowly adding more weapons, balancing them, fixing the currency and reward systems.     
Had to take a break again before the second expansion came out again due to lack of content and owning all of the exotic/raid armour and weapons.     
Second expansion was way better than the first but there was no new raid like there was in the first. They introduced a 3 man multi tier mission. That got boring after the first week, so again I've been on a break most of the time since the release of house of wolves.     
The guys at Bungie are listening to our complaints and are fixing almost everything. People can shit on this game all they like but at its core it's amazing and a super fun game to play.    
While it is definitely a grind to get all the gear you want it's fun while doing, although very repetitive.     
The release of TTK and the legendary edition is the perfect time to get into Destiny. There will be 3 raids, a shit load of strikes and an actual story to play.    
They have added more PvP game modes with awesome rewards and they're super fun to play.     
Even though I'm still on a break to the release I'm very excited for the game and I hope it brings a lot of new players as well as bringing a lot of the old ones back.    
Just my two cents anyway. ","1441066138"

Also, reading this I realised I had a bit of a blind-spot about the words 'they/their'. Like, if I had been the one coming up with this policy, I think I would have gone for usages of 'she' and 'he' be replaced with 'they', and 'her' and 'his' be replaced with 'their'. I can see that that's slightly grammatically wrong since it implies a plural, but are their any ethical grounds to oppose it? Using 'they' and 'their' is a less drastic step that wouldn't require you to teach new words, but could still communicate most of the concept.

However, I do not think they are going to want to deal with the hassle of pulling out a test kit every single time they have to question if someone is vaping nicotine or marijuana. That is where the problem lies, government is inherently lazy due to bureaucracy. They will almost always find and take the shortcut. That is my fear here. 

We probably still have a good 5 years before anything will be done on a national level with regards to marijuana in my opinion. In California the reps for cops brought this up at the last hearing. That is a state that is very accepting of medicinal marijuana and they are saying it.  It gets brought up in a lot of hearings as a reason to put major restrictions on e-cigs in cities. Cops are saying it all across the nation. That's only going to get stronger as marijuana acceptance becomes more and more. Until it's legal on a national level it'll probably always be a problem for them. ","1441066140"

"LetsNotMeet","t5_2t3t8","In College it was common practice for students studying life drawing to be assigned doing a life study (sketch) or series of studies in the real world. My favorite place to go was the courthouse--because it was quiet, and you could sit in the gallery and draw faces from the witness stand, or folks on the jury as they sat relatively still--oblivious--and made great subjects. 
People standing quietly behind a counter can also make a good subject, if they don't realize they are being sketched. Basically the artist doesn't want someone posing or acting unnatural. Now Reddit, don't crucify me for Jack/Rose Titanic drawing bullshit. That happens (in your DiCaprio fantasies) but not for an unscripted life sketch. So who knows the artist's gender, but I can vouch that there are legit reasons some artists would choose to draw you--unknowingly, again and again. She could have been some shy, Scarlett Johansson-look-alike who had a crush on you.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Alright! So your [TDEE is roughly 2080.](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) That's the number of calories your body burns just by being alive. It's recommended to calculate that number assuming zero physical activity, as without a heart rate monitor, most exercise estimates are pretty off.

So, eat 1580 calories per week to lose 1lb/wk, or 1200 to lose almost 2lbs/wk. Eating fewer than 1200 calories can run you the risk of malnutrition. Think of any exercise calories burned as ""bonus,"" and make sure not to eat back those burned calories - this serves the double benefit of helping you lose quicker, and avoiding any calorie burning overestimations. Plus, you won't be off-track as much if life gets in the way and you miss a day or two of walking.

I'd also recommend resetting your MFP settings back to zero physical activity aka completely sedentary - the app automatically adjusts your calorie goals as you lose weight, and having exercise plugged in to those settings can throw that adjustment off (although I doubt it'll put you much lower than 1200). It sounds like you understand the basics of weight loss, but I just want to reiterate that weight loss comes from your diet, not from exercise!

Low # of moves, while they aren't hugely important (as you said 30 moves or 40 doesn't matter if you can get it done under 4 sec), are a nice little ""achievement"" when youre fiddling around on dawnglare haha

In the end though, I think it depends on what you are trying to get out of the game, if you are in it for the RPG element (the grinding, the plus eggs, clearing the dungeons, building teams etc.) then this little stuff doesn't matter since your goal is to just clear the board and beat the bosses. If you are in it for a nice brain exercise then the little meticulous movements and puzzling aspects are more fun.

And what you say about 7~8 combos often times is completely solving the board is absolutely true, the chance of a random board being 9 combos or more is roughly only about 20%.","1441066142"

My argument is that there should be an attempt to phase out animal names in common use that refer to species of non-fish as fish, and that refer to a species of dolphin as whales.  I'm not arguing that the terms in common usage are not linguistically correct, I'm arguing that it would be nice if common use better reflected the actual biology.

&gt;You might as well come up with a new name for starfish/sea stars, because they're not massive balls of gas in space either.

Sea stars are called that because they are star shaped.  They shouldn't be called starfish because they don't resemble fish and aren't related to fish.

The 3 teams representing NA at worlds (CLG,TSM,C9) have only 1 Korean player altogether, 3 EU players, and the rest NA players. While many of the weaker teams in NA have a bunch of KR players here and there, so even if they were ""better players"" they are not going to be as successful as a team. For example, TSM has always been a top 2 team in NA, so any decent player would seem to be successful on the team since TSM are always going to be representing NA at international tournaments. While someone like Impact (who is considered one of the best top laners in NA) is going to be considered not as successful because his team is not going to worlds. At the end of the day, if the team is not good to begin with no single player (regardless of how good he may be) is going to change them from being a mid tier team to one of the best teams in their region.

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","Jump on MY moral compass. It really strengthens your argument. Do we want to do the insults thing? When you try to make your point in what is basically point-by-point form it makes me think you have the memory span of a goldfish. Do you struggle to remember what I said two lines before the last one? When you go point-by-point it really makes you miss my stance and it makes you look shortsighted.

Why don't we just not play the insult game - it's stupid. We both agree that these kind of funds are sub-optimal and probably one of the worst decisions someone can make aside from just not saving at all. Then again, not saving at all isn't really a decision - just a lack thereof. Do you feel better now that I've acknowledged that something like this fund is garbage? Can you look into what kind of stance I'm actually trying to make?

I think the problem is I'm a bit of a big fan of encouraging people to take these things into their own hands rather than trying to put the blame game on these ""advisers"" like you are. I really dislike the train of thought that these kind of MER's and funds need to be regulated away with deeper regulation and more of the government stepping in to go ""Shit...the people are getting even stupider with their money...time to get involved with MORE REGULATION"".

The actual SHAMEFUL (well, naïve?) thing is that someone felt like they should walk into a bank with zero idea of what they want, not bother to shop around, and took the advice of someone who has NO DUTY to not act in a biased manner and just...do it with all of their savings. As if that is really the best thing you can do. 

It's just a constant pattern with Canadians and someone that we all complain about here - the level of naivety. Did your parents sign you up with an RBC Debit Card? Then obviously once you need to start saving money you go straight to RBC, spend $0 on talking to an adviser, and do the first thing that they tell you to do. Do you bother talking to TD? Do you bother talking to CIBC? Do you bother checking out ANY other options or doing research? Of course not!

Nobody buys a car without research, or buys a house without shopping around, so why do we ""spend"" all of our savings based on what the first person we talk to tells us to do? Someone we refuse to even spend a penny on, and therefore needs to be paid through hidden fees? 

These kind of advisers need to be just plain ol' outed for what they are. They're paid through their ability to sign you up for high cost funds, and that is fine. They're not your adviser and they are biased and they don't owe you anything at all. 

So, since I we like to quote things:

&gt;I told him to educate himself. I pointed him to a specific resource, and a general one. And following that information will, inevitably, lead to him terminating his relationship with that FA. Because at that point he will be of no consequence.

I'm totally on board with you here. I think a bit of research and learning will be the greatest thing to ever happen to OP. He'll never sign himself up for a raw deal ever again.

But I think the adviser thing (BEFORE I knew how much bullshit this adviser was ACTUALLY spewing https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/3j458p/few_noobie_questions_about_investing/cumc3hf ) is actually pretty fair. If you spend $0 on getting advice and walk in without shopping around you're probably going to get what you paid for - a raw deal. Seems ""fair"".

The best way to make sure you don't get hacked or shit doesn't get stolen is to make it so no one knows where it is and disable the connection when its not in use. ","1441066146"

"discgolf","t5_2qk68","This drill was meant just to get a feel for what it feels like to have your hips swing your arm around. As far as shoulders go, they'll have to be added separately for more power. I've seen some good discussion recently about making sure to activate your offhand during your throw. You'll see a lot of the pros punch their offhand downward during the drive. Getting that into the drive really seems to help, it pulls you in tight, and lets you rotate around efficiently. 

In regards to the timing of the knees, I linked a couple of videos for reference. You can see the rear knee gets mostly pointing forward before the front starts to rotate. There's a little bit of time while they're both actively turning forward at the same time. 

I've found that it can be hard to just watch a video of someone who has all the parts working right, because pretty much none of the rest of us do. I think in relation to checking specific timing questions like the sequence of the knees moving in, it works great.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","If you do everything right (small deficit, lifting heavy, enough protein), you can lose up to about 0.7% of your bodyweight per week, and have 90% of it be fat and 10% of it lean.  If you don't do everything right then you'll lose a lower percentage of fat.

If you do everything right, (large enough surplus, lifting heavy, enough protein), you can gain maybe 0.4 lb. of muscle per week, if you're a beginner.  The longer you lift, the more slowly you can gain muscle.

So, it's faster to lose fat than to gain muscle.  So since gaining is the harder part, you optimize for gains by making absolutely sure you're eating enough.  Since you're not perfect at measuring, that means overshooting a bit and adding a bit of extra fat.  That's okay, because losing fat is much faster than gaining muscle.  Hence bulking and cutting.

The alternative is to bulk very slowly all of the time.  The disadvantage is that it slows down your muscle gain rate to less than what you could achieve by bulking and cutting.  The advantage is that you're never fat.","1441066146"

And KoNY is about equal to KoT + 1 expansion.

Another example of idiots ruling the world is nuclear and nucular.

In my area you would not be able to find a newer KTM four stroke for $2K, but perhaps Kansas is different. A $2000 budget will likely get you an 04-06 name-brand Japanese 250 four stroke, which are usually pretty reliable if you do the maintenance required.  

You are a larger rider, so a lot of people will want to stick you on a 450, FYI, be prepared. If you do a lot of slower speed trail riding (ie you don't plan on bombing across the desert at 85mph every weekend) a 250 four stroke should be fine.","1441066155"

"Megaten","t5_2sj8i","Straight up. This game saved my life. I geniunely mean this with 100% seriousness.
During my teenagehood my father became extremely emotionally abusive to the entire family. I had lost all hope completely and utterly and a lot of bad thoughts entered my head. Especially those of suicide and even worse. I started to play Final Fantasy 7 because video games were my only damn escape from the nightmare of my life. I had gotten to the half way point when a character dies and I dropped the game for a bit, feeling saddened.
A month later my father got a blood clot in his leg and even a stroke as doctors operated on him. They did save his life but we found out that it was all caused by something else. My father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in both his stomach and liver. The hospitial kept him for a few days until we brought him home. The doctors told us he had up to two months to live.
During this time I holed myself in my room, only coming out for food or to help my family and nothing else. I began playing Final Fantasy 7 again to escape hearing my fathers occasional screams of pain as the morphine had no effect due to his copious use of oxycotton due to injuries in the past.
I played the game more and more. At this point I wanted a way out anyway out as I also hated my father more and more for everything he has done to our family and would soon be leaving us without ever making up for all the things he did. In a way I also wanted to end his pain and my own at the same time. I heavily considered it more and more, A selfish act in retrospect. I played the game even more and three days before my dad died in a hospice with my mom beside him, I had beat the game and saw the ending.
It helped calm me and I realize how foolish I had been about everything. I hated my father, I knew that much I could change. But this was going to be the last days of his life and I had to be a good person and help my family after he had passed. I stopped considering suicide and began living my life to the fullest because we just have this one life to live.
I cried, witnessing the credits to the game. The first time I had cried in months. All the emotions I had felt through these harsh months all came flooding in at that one point. I stood up and I walked out in the living room and hugged my dad, telling him that I loved him with what little love I had left.
He hugged me too and told me to go to bed. A few days later he died in his bed at hospice... the night before telling my mom that he was sorry for how he was and to please forgive him before he became delusional from the pain... his last lucid moment. I don't know why but I didn't cry at all during this moment. I still am unsure what is wrong with me but I think I let out all the feelings I had during the end credits of the game. I miss him in some ways and in many others I don't.
Right now me and my family are just trying to live life happily. Death comes to everyone, but it's the journey that matters the most in the end. The game helped me realize that and if I were to ever meet the makers of the game I think I would break down and cry, thanking them for helping to save my life and encourage me to keep living.
If they ever did read this. I would thank them from the very bottom of my heart for making me a better person and helping me make peace with my father before he died. Thank you Squaresoft.

About playing safe, when I play Yasuo in midlane, I play aggressive (except versus the really tough matchups like Riven), so losing my AD or armor for a simple chance to crit isn't worth for me.

I never told that going Triforce is better or worse than IE, it's how you are planning to play.
Again, the Statikk-&gt;IE gives more damage in teamfights, I'm with you on that, but the Trinity gives you a good outplay potential and a lot stronger splitpush. So I build IE if I'm going to play full teamfights for ults etc, and I build Trinity if I'm going to duel and splitpush, that's all. I always build Mercs, Tabi if full AD, never Berserker's, and I build one defensive item, you don't really need more.

In the end, this is a playstyle, if you like yours, stick with it. Just don't act like an ass thinking that we are all just following Bjergsen and you have the ultimate answer, it's our playstyle, you have yours. :)","1441066157"

To expand on that - it starts out as a very ""adultswim"" offensive show that is kind of funny, but mostly very blatant satire of religion.     

But, and that is a capital B U T, starting with the season 2 finale, it explores its characters and all the darkness underneath these as-of-yet twodimensional caricatures. It gets a whole lot darker than Rick and Morty (adultswim cancelled the show halfway through season 3, because it became too dark even for them), but I think it earns its emotional moments just as well as the former. 
The greatness of the final episodes works best if you know the characters and events beforehand, so I would recommend just watching it all. Each episode is only 10 minutes long.   

But if you need an abrigded run that still prepares you for the emotional gutpunches from Season 3, here is my list:    

* The Lord's Greatest Gift
* Loyalty  
* Best Christmas Ever
* God's Image 
* Lord's Prayer  
* Holy Visage 
* Be Fruitful and Multiply  
* School Peagant
* Presents for God

Sometimes you watch gameplay of a game and just know that in spite of the flaws it's going to have, you're probably going to really like it.

Edit: To add on to this, I really believe that review sites should have at least three reviewers per game. Each aspect of the game is covered in sections where each reviewer can write about their thoughts on that part of the game. (These sections wouldn't need to always be the same, they could be flexible depending on the type of game.) At the end of this, each reviewer could insert their own pluses and minuses, along with a number. 

I think this is so much better than the way it's done now. They could even average out the numbers to give a conclusive review score, which would be what showed up on metacritic and narrow the wide spectrum of review scores that games usually get.","1441066157"

It was buffed into usability, but it still doesn't shine very bright. You need a catalyst to buff it so it can function as an acceptable catalyst anyway, so more often than not you're better off just using an off-hand catalyst and a different weapon.

1. Because I'm in bed to enjoy sex, not be a professor. Because I don't want to hear ""You...you think I'm pretty, right?"" halfway through. Because I don't want her wondering if she's doing the right things. Because confidence matters.

2. For sure, the &lt;1% ivy league girls, who happen to be smart, are great. No doubt about it. I lived in SF and worked for startups. Motivated young people? Super hot. Because they have passion and energy and they're probably smart. 

But something tells me this comparison is off by a large margin... let's compare the 18 year old ivy league girls/startup girls to the 18 year old suburban high school graduate with no prospects for college... oh... all the sudden, even though they're the same age, one's more attractive than the other! 

What about comparing an 18 year old suburban high school graduate to a 29 year old top lawyer or consultant?... the 29 year old is probably way more attractive, and probably way better in bed, too.

As for that last sentence...I don't know what you're referring to at all. I'm not trying to degrade the quality of 18 year olds, I was wondering if other people felt the same way about there being an age gap. And I was also wondering what older guys see in younger girls. ","1441066159"

I mean if Iran has an oil output limit of 2 million barrels of oil a day, that means a certain amount of jobs. What's a recently graduated engineer going to do then? Same for gas projects. And when the money comes in, countless more engineers will be needed for infrastructure and building projects. Same for aviation, the auto industry, and services in general (IT, healthcare etc). All those industries I mentioned are starving for funds and investments. This deal should take care of that, unless the US keeps pressuring it's 'allies' against trading with Iran regardless of the deal. Good management is necessary too, but if there really isn't any money to go around, good management alone can't fix this. So the opening up should boost the economy and jobs considerably, and also stem the drain of educated people abroad. Heck, it will reverse it, with many recent emigres going back, and even long time foreign Iranians investing in Iran. Coupled with good management, this deal is a silver bullet. And that's based on facts. Aside from current low energy prices even. The pent up demand and backlog alone is enough for a few years. ","1441066161"

No, seriously. Build a clock. 

It's a trivial matter to subdivide a circle into 12 equal parts to make a clock face. You use a compass the same length as the radius and walk it around the perimeter. You end up with 6 equal sections. Bisecting those six sections into twelve is a trivial matter.  Try to do the same thing with ten sections and it's not nearly as simple a task. Somewhere, you've got to pentasect (divide into 5) an arc, and pentasection is a much more complicated process. 

So far we've only been worrying about the clock face. That's actually the simple part most forgiving of error.  In building your clock, you've now got to cut gears so that the seconds and minutes maintain the proper ratios with eachother. The gear teeth all need to be evenly spaced to work properly. You really want to use that fancy pentasection technique to get base-10 teeth on the gears for your clock?

It's not that subdividing the day into halves and thirds and quarters is more useful. It's that the geometry is so much simpler when you base it off a hexagon rather than a pentagon. ","1441066165"

At first, i was disappointed because there would be an influx of goldsellers and troll players, but the restrictions comes in handy here. I've managed to meet at least 5 new player, and as a veteran with over 7500hrs ingame across all game modes, i became their ""mentor"". Whenever they have a problem or a question, they're free to whisper me and i'll try to help them, and i'm actually liking it.

Gw2 is very different from what they're used to, most of them are fascinated with small things like waypoints and being able to complete a quest (heart) without having to kill 10 minotaurs. 

I believe that veteran players should be the first to show them how the community is. Give them the example of how we support  friendliness and fellowship, and they may start acting like us.

The POS will not disable a mark out. Its up to the partner to be honest and not get more than 1. I can literally ring a partner for a coffee markout every day of the week and it won't stop me. They use to just take it from your paycheck (this was over 8 years ago so I don't know if they still do it).

I would be really careful if I was you and just being up front. Your having a huge focus by corporate on Asset protection and hiring more partners for those jobs. They don't hire them for nothing.

Basically, ever since Piglet came to NA, he's been struggling. Communication problems, homesickness, community backlash, so-called attitude and in-team issues, got benched, struggled throughout both splits, had 3 real chances at making Worlds and ended up losing them all. He's super ambitious and emotional, and in retrospective, all the struggles he'd went through, achieved him absolutely nothing. Considering he's still missing Korea greatly, not making much progress with his career and most likely feeling completely devastated after the loss (we're talking about the guy who's been bragging to everyone back in Korea that he's about to become a champion again), I don't think he will want to stay in NA. Why stay somewhere that you had moved to to become big, but where you've had barely any success at?

Disallowing some race or linguistic group seems to fit the definition much more closely. I really don't understand people who go out of their way to be racist in this way. For example, I see profiles who explicitly say no blacks, or white only, worded in a variety of ways. First: Come on, are you so inundated by people of a different race that you feel it necessary to shoo them off in advance of writing to you? Second: it seems self-defeating, discouraging potential partners who want nothing to do with racists. Or maybe that's the point -- attracting only other racists?

"SSBPM","t5_2u3tn","1) Somewhat tricky to define. I've thought about it, exactly trying to categorize what the fundamentals are, but I haven't yet gotten a firm grasp on it. I think once I learn myself how to put it to words, it would take an entire article to explain it, and I've been looking for one of us to do an MoM on it. It boils down to concepts of spacing, manipulation, and punishment in various scenarios, I think, but exactly what fundamentals means is contextually different than in traditional fighting games and while the same core concepts might apply, they come up in different ways in Smash.

2) Your primary goal with fundamentals should be to outplay your opponent. Tech skill gives you tools for various scenarios to do this, but it doesn't win the game alone. For example, you cannot waveshine your way to victory against good opponents except by dumb luck unless you understand what the risks are, what the rewards can be, and how to both set up situations in which these options are possibly useful and capitalize on these situations. For example, wavedashing is applicable in a large multitude of situations, but something specific like shield dropping is a little more nuanced, though still pretty broadly useful, and something like Mewtwo's side-B pull through the ledge is highly situational (though not all very situational tech skills are as easy to do). I wouldn't focus on quantifying the balance of tech skill and fundamentals, but instead try to always contextualize the skills you learn in terms of questions like ""what is a good spacing for landing these combo moves,"" or ""in what scenarios is it useful to try closing in for a shine to start pillaring,"" or ""how can learning to moonwalk affect my neutral game"". Use the tech skill to add to your neutral game, microspacing, and punish game, rather than trying to force the tech skill in inappropriate situations. What is appropriate can be learned through experience and trial/error.

3) This is a problem I'm facing myself still. Microspacing is a big trial for me, largely because, as I mentioned, my core gameplay started building early on based on playing against CPUs in Melee. Sethlon's threat zones he refers to in his Roy guide are great for thinking about this, but it's hard to think about these things on the fly. Experience, I think, will teach you what is threatening and what isn't, so instead of trying to mentally draw bubbles moving around on the stage as you and your opponent are whizzing about, you should be focusing on what the main potent threats are (things like maybe dash attacks, sudden quick smashes, grabs, tilts, rushdown aerials) and try to just intuit a sense of where those moves might land if your opponent tried to use them. It's a bit easier to intuit where your own moves will hit since you have better control over your own character, but keep in mind that your opponent may be baiting out your moves. In general I recommend erring on the side of caution, trying to avoid all your opponents' potential range and closing in slowly to see what kinds of moves they like to use. Keeping track of the spacing in real time, though, is just a matter of reaction. It turns out that the reaction time from the conscious brain to your hands is something like milliseconds, so if you can internalize a sense of matchups automatically, so that if your opponent closes in a bit, you automatically just react by either punishing an unsafe edge forward or get back to some safety, instead of taking time to process the information, realize the opponent moved in, and try to react later when your opponent may have already done something new. Staying with the pace of the game in terms of microspacing requires ""don't think, just do,"" because thinking can take anywhere from milliseconds to seconds too much time, and by then you're far too late. The more experience you have, the better you'll be able to ""just do"" the right thing without thinking. You have to really internalize the game.","1441066172"

I think this is one of the worst FPS games that I have ever played, and I hate that it is from the BF series. My main complaint is weapon balancing. I always enjoyed BF due to good weapon balancing, in older games if you burst fired an AR while prone at 75yards vs a guy running, firing a sub full auto, you would win. They also balanced each class well, high fire rate/low damage vs low fire rate/high damage. none of this matters now in BFH, pretty much run mechanic or get melted.  Because of this a lot of people snipe. So it's mechanics and camping snipers on maps that aren't very good. gameplay doesn't feel intense, people leave.  The game has a lot of other things that turn myself, and I am sure other people away from the game, but the weapon balancing is what initially kills the game for me.","1441066176"

I think this is partly the problem. You should be able to put together a little table (on paper or on a spreadsheet) that lays out exactly how much you got paid (or owe) from each lab.

I feel like I'm missing something here. It seems like it would be a fairly simple matter to at least get the facts. Have you been paid for the work that you actually performed at the lab you worked for? Did your boss report your time correctly and is the HR person accounting for this?

If you bring in an accountant or lawyer, they are going to ask you to do the exact same thing so that they can establish what your situation is. In a nutshell, what are the facts as you see them and what are the facts according to the university HR department. You aren't disputing HR's claim that you didn't work for your old lab and your current boss (plus your own records) should be able to confirm what you worked this summer so in the end there shouldn't be that much room for disagreement.","1441066176"

"1200isplenty","t5_2xk5e","* 30/f, 5'7"", CW 145, GW 140? (I'll see how I feel when I get there.)
* I try to stick to 1200 a day, but I occasionally have days where I eat more. I don't typically eat back exercise calories, as I tend to overdo it if I go past 1200. That being said, I am not religious about tracking every single calorie; I'll forget to count the creamer I put in my coffee or the sample I try at the store and I don't worry too much about it.
* I do Zumba 2-3 times a week. I also walk a ton every day. I aim for 10,000-12,000 steps a day. 
* At this point, I have lost 95 pounds, and I started just over 2 years ago. I lost the majority of it in the first year, and my weight loss has slowed down significantly since that. Each pound I lose now is a huge victory.
* I went at least 6 months without losing any weight. It was hard to deal with, but I eventually had to admit to myself that I was being lax, and the reason I wasn't losing was that almost every day, when I got to 1200, I would just keep eating. I would also give in to free food or candy at work and not track it. Instead of being mad at myself for it though, I needed to recognize that although I wasn't losing anymore, I hadn't gained any of it back, and while it wasn't my intention to maintain, I'd been maintaining for 6 months, which was still pretty cool. I eventually just needed to force myself to be accountable and jump back into it, which I did at the beginning of June this year. I started using a calendar and putting a silly sticker on the previous day if I stuck to my 1200 goal, and this has really helped me stick with it. I've had a handful of days without stickers each month, but far more stickers than no stickers.  ","1441066177"

Think about it, if you learn a certain technique with a paintbrush you can use it in your paintings and *that* will give you fresh ideas. It's the cool ideas in this video that make it, not the smooth animations.

Now the typing effect at the start is easy, changing the fonts at 0:14 is easier. From there it's interesting keyframing/animating beside some great audio/sfx (I mean mute it and play some generic royalty-free track and see what I mean). AnimationComposer is a plugin that you could grab for free(mium) and it would help a novice get smooth animations quickly.","1441066178"

Perhaps they detected ADSB data from another aircraft using 9MMRD and applied the flight number data from the last available flight record, which would be 5-31 and 06-01 flights MH88/89. Those flights have the exact same times in both directions.~~  No, scratch that, the 06-02 MH88 flight woul have picked up one of the other 06-02 flights instead.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I flat out asked her if she was there.  Her response was honest, which was a bit of a relief (she said yes), but I don't feel a sincere regret.  I told her how it made me feel, and let her know that it wasn't about a lack of trust as far as cheating goes, because honestly I don't think it was about that.  I told her I felt deceived, and that doing something after saying you wouldn't is bullshit (I was more civil than that), especially when it concerns an ex.  

What bothers me more than anything is the fact that she felt like the right choice was to hide her actions than just 'man up' and talk to me about it.  If you believe what you're doing is right, then fucking DEFEND it.  I'll listen to logic and reason any day.  That doesn't mean I'm going to say ""okay, it doesn't bother me now"", but atleast we'd be communicating about it rather than doing something behind the others back to avoid a confrontation.  This is the woman I love, and that I chose to trust to be my partner in life, but I'm not going to ever put up with deception.  

So I spent the day going back and forth with text messages (I can't call while at work), and I still don't feel like I've reached through to her.  I can understand her outlook, she (most likely) did nothing to cross any sort of boundaries with him, and she knew if she told me it would be an unpleasant discussion, so she went, brought a friend, and enjoyed the night.  I'm sure her and him talked briefly, but the likelihood is it was short and cordial.  Then her fiance messages her, upset, having somehow found out about it, and she goes on the defensive.

The thing I'm trying to emphasize is the deception.  I'd be happier if she'd just outright told me ""Hey, I know we talked about this before, but I haven't seen my friend in a few weeks, and wanted to take her to my ex's restaurant, how do you feel about it?"" and open up the gates of discussion, you know, like adults do.

Description of RP Character (min. 100 words): The sea is all I have ever known. I was born on a ship and god be willing I was going to die on a ship someday. The sea is harsh and unforgiving around the island, but I give my love and respect to her all the same. 

The crew of the ship scurried about completing their task of preparing the ship for a storm that was brewing. The taste of salt in the air comforted me as I stared out into the horizon. I could see the storm clouds in the distance creeping towards us as the sun fell out of view. I could feel it in my bones, the tingling feeling that I was meant to be here at this moment. Tonight would be the night we finally tamed the prey we have been hunting for so long. The fabled white plesiosaur that had eluded us for years was close. This could be the only chance I get to tame this beast and I wont let a little thunder and lightening scare us away from this beauty. Too long have we been second rate seamen, tonight we do the impossible and claim this beast for ourselves and become men of legend. 

As I stand there at the helm of the ship wondering to myself what this night has planned for me thunder roars out in the distance. If the sea takes me tonight then so be it, for I love the sea and she loves me back in her own cruel and mysterious way.","1441066180"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Normally, it's best for untrained personnel to do nothing than to try and do something they don't understand. There's a lot of shit they could have done to help, yes. There's also a lot of shit they could have done to *hurt,* as well, including many things that would seem like good ideas. The key is that most people don't know what should and shouldn't be done.

For instance, most people don't understand that Rule #1 of first aid is that you don't move the subject. Don't try to restrain someone who's having a seizure. Don't move the head to try and put a makeshift pillow under it so they can be more comfortable. For fuck's sakes do not drag the victim. I don't care if your friend says there are cars coming, block the fucking road or something, do not drag the victim do not drag the victim do not drag the victim.

Shit, most modern first aid training emphasizes doing *nothing* if the subject isn't in imminent danger (e.g. they are not breathing, they are bleeding out, they are on fucking fire, etc.) Even the slightest kindness outside of what is absolutely necessary to save a life can make the situation irreparably worse.

It's not just being scared of lawsuits. It's that, if you aren't trained to do these things, you need to step the fuck back because your good intentions don't amount to much in the world of emergency response. I get that it's noble and all to want to save a life, but it's not ignoble to restrain yourself when you don't know what to do.","1441066180"

"wow","t5_2qio8","*Should* is the basis for most wipes, IMO.  You can shout *should should should* until you're blue in the face, but what difference does it make if reality turns out otherwise?

In a PUG, there will *always* be a base level of confusion and miscommunication.  It's up to a PUG RL to build a raiding environment that guards against those things.

The easiest way to do this (again, IMO) is two-fold:

1. Set clear expectations around how communication happens, e.g., tell everyone that if I assign people to specific roles, it's their job to confirm it without me prompting them to confirm it.  It will only take 2-3 pulls before I'm no longer the one ""responsible"" for making this happen.
2. Reduce the number of things people need to coordinate around / communicate about / pay attention to

I had this argument with some folks in a N Archimonde PUG kill the other day.  We died in the first pull because a hunter used Deterrence to solo soak [Shadowfel Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=183817/shadowfel-burst) and a few people didn't react quickly enough to the announcement of ""Hunter!  Hunter!  I'm deterrencing, don't soak!"" in vent.

Most folks were of the mind that everyone ""should"" know — there's what word again — that if a hunter or mage is hit by Shadowfel Burst that they should not soak because they'll use Deterrence or Ice Block to handle it.  It's easy, right?  Just pay attention to who is targeted by Shadowfel Burst, pay attention in vent, and act accordingly.

Conversely, I'm of the mind that the mechanic is easy enough to handle without making exceptions for hunters and mages and that the benefit (some damage saved) is dwarfed by the cost of failed communication (a death, if not a wipe).

In a group with established patterns and conventions of communication, the likelihood of failed communication is much smaller.  In a PUG, it's best to design around the reality that communication is much more likely to fail rather than insist that folks *should should should* do this or do that.

[Wiio's Laws](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/wiio.html) is a tongue-in-cheek take on this (and a great read). :)","1441066186"

I would be fine with Adnan getting out after 20 years under a couple of conditions:

- He stops this charade, admits his crime and gives Hae's family closure.  He's victimized them for long enough with his denials, and he's also made victims his family, the muslim community that supported him (financially and otherwise), and I would also argue that he's victimized his supporters with his ruse.  I fear that this might be a black mark on the careers of some lawyers who have taken up this cause.  At any rate, Adnan doesn't get to retain his honor, continue victimizing people **and** be free.  He has to choose.

- The prison psychologists and parole board deemed that he wasn't a threat.  Obviously, this would involve digging into his relationship with his secret prison ex-wife to see if there were any similar patterns of manipulation, controlling behavior and potential for IPV (although that would be limited in prison) during their marriage and subsequent divorce.  It seems that he's batting 1 for 2 in terms of killing his partner after the breakup of the relationship, and the second one was while he was incarcerated, so I think it's important to ensure that he isn't a danger going forward.

I understand that with the way the system is set up in the US neither of these things are likely to happen, but in a perfect world, that's what I would like to see in this case.","1441066190"

Our cat is affectionate after she gets to know you, and will jump on your keyboard and knead your pant leg if you let her and everything, but it took time. She feels very intelligent, too. She assigns a use to each person she knows. Not to be rude or bossy, because I don't think cats really do that, but just because they want things and can't do it themselves.  She never bugs me for anything more than letting her outside, because that's all I do for her when she bugs me. She'll bother my sister or dad in the morning constantly because they're the ones that feed her.

We have a dog too, and he'll just run right up to you and try and get pets and attention of other sorts. He's a smart dog too, but they feel like they have different personalities, and go about things differently.

So it's kinda like... Our dog is the super outgoing from the start one, and our cat is kinda reserved and quiet until you get to know her.

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","&gt; 1) Does it bother you that honest-to-god bigots have so often voiced support for GG?

Yes.

&gt; 2) Is there anything GG can do to exclude these people? Should it exclude these people?

Given that literally anyone can type #GamerGate into twitter and immediately be branded a loyal and integral part of GamerGate, there is very little that can be done until such time as that attitude goes away.  Seriously, you should try making an egg account, spewing some textual diarrhea (which, by the way, no sane person would ever believe) tagged with #GamerGate and wait for someone opposed to pick it up and announce that's actually what GamerGate is about.

Then, try arguing it isn't the case.

Now, assuming assholes actually support better gaming journalism?  As long as they aren't being assholes (e.g., harassing), it frankly doesn't matter.  Do I *like* some of those people's history?  *Hell no*.  But even unsavory people can set bullshit aside now and then and behave civilly during moments of clarity.

That said, bigots don't normally set their self-righteous idiocy aside long enough to be considered much other than idiots.

&gt; 3) Assuming GG can be used as a tool to recruit moderates into hate groups, does that mean GG is itself a hate group?

Absolutely not.

*Shit example ahead*: Just because radical elements in a religion recruit from moderate elements of that same religion (and other groups) does in no way make that moderate religion a hate group; those diabolical assholes in the radicalized group, however, damned well could be.  Moreover, neither does said asshole radical faction define said religion and/or group(s) in their entirely.

This is the same of *any* group.

&gt; 4) If not, how do you explain the support GG receives from hate groups? Shouldn't a progressive group naturally be in opposition to these people?

Assholes, bigots and trolls are drawn to attention.  GamerGate garners attention. As such, actions by shitty people gain immense backlash much to their overwhelming joy.

Generally to absolutely, yes; particularly if they cannot set aside their garbage (see #2).  But you see, here we come to a problem in this whole situation:  *we have* been pushing back against that very conceptual spew from the start only to be told we're ""not sincere"".  Quite literally, I can tell you with all seriousness, this post and many more like it are very, very, very routinely completely dismissed as a ""smokescreen"".

So allow me to rebut:

""*Why* should anyone involved with GamerGate make overt opposition to shitty things when (damned near literally) nobody opposed admits that elements within GamerGate have done so?""

There is ***no case*** in which anti-GamerGate is willing to admit that non-shitty people support GamerGate.

* Anything positive: always bad.
* Anything bad: always bad.
* Anything unrelated: always bad
* Anythi--***BAD***

Ergo, what motivation does GamerGate or the decent people within have ***any*** reason to continue trying to actively change that opinion which seems absolutely immutable?

I can tell you, right now, that I don't support the zealots on either side.  I don't support the asshole bigots on either side.  I don't support the harassment of either side.

I will still have people tell me that I'm lying.  Hell, I know the children posts to this post will decry this very self-same thing.  I've stopped shouting these things from the rooftops because experience in this kerfuffle has told me that it doesn't matter: I'm apparently always lying, always a bigot, always a racist, always a KKK supporter, always worse than ISIS regardless of what I explain, what I try, what I do.

Until people stop the frenzy and actually take time to listen and consider rationally, moderates and other good people will forevermore be ""literally Hitler"" regardless of reality.

Long post, probably tons of errors, but I'll try to fix them if I find them.  Good questions, OP.","1441066192"

By the way, we're not talking about centuries timescales here, it's *tens of million years!*. The Andromeda Galaxy is practically in our backyard and is on collision course with the Milky Way. Still, at 50% c it would take *5 million years* to get there. This long ago our ancestors were essentially chimpanzees inhabiting the savannas.

Now the further galaxies have distances in light years comparable to the age of the universe (times c) -- most galaxies we can see e.g. in the [HUDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field) are in early stages of evolution. If the current rate of expansion of the universe continues, it will be impossible to even get there travelling at c. That is, some time from now we may not even see those galaxies anymore, although there's no super convincing theory explaining the expansion of the universe yet afaik.","1441066196"

"MTB","t5_2qo3d","I had a 2003 that I tried a hitch mount on and I had to use an extender. It was a tray mount style and I couldn't open the tailgate because the tire would hit the rack where it bent up. This happened regardless of whether the rack was folded down or not. It was very frustrating. I sold it and went with a spare mount from Yakima and then one from Thule. It went with the Jeep when I sold it. If you don't have the height to mount a bike to a roof mount, which I didn't, then you are stuck with a spare mount. 

Edit: While folks here have offered some great rack suggestions, they haven't taken into consideration the biggest qualifier that you set forth, which is what vehicle it is going on. The spare tire mount on the tailgate of a Liberty is low and will cause interference with most everything listed here, including the 1upUSA, which I now have and absolutely love, although on a Subaru. 

One thing that may help is to remove the spare, and then rotate the spare carrier 180 degrees. That may give you about two inches of clearance between the tire and rack and thus allow you to open the tailgate with a rack on and folded down. Worth a shot and a free ""mod"". ","1441066199"

True, but you can also go through various online reputable dealers like for instance http://www.ozgameshop.com/ for us Australians which usually save us 10%-20% when we do preorder. (we can pay anywhere from $80-$100 for a AAA title her in Australia.

&gt; Do you know how many great games you could get for 50 dollars during a steam sale?

That only benefits PC gamers, not the console crew but you're right you do usually save a fuck tonne, generally you save upwards of 30-70%

I typically have mine set to 'softer' so I can hear both the song and directions. 2: most music players will 'duck' the audio whenever an alert is being played too, like directions, or a notification. Some will stop the song and resume after the notification is done (but then you lose the beat. The Winamp app did this last I checked). Some will ignore the notification all together, and keep playing at the same volume. 3: for rooted phones, there's an Xposed Module I remember seeing for manipulating how your music player and notifications interact, for those of you who are rooted and don't want to switch apps.

"bindingofisaac","t5_2sxpk","ill once again start this post letting everyone down, due to pax we are just today finalizing the release date for afterbirth… therefor we need to postpone the release date trailer till next monday so we can start taking preorders on the same date. i know it seems like im messing with you guys at this point but i swear im not, in fact ill give you a bit of info about release to ease your minds a bit.
-afterbirth will be out before xmas
-afterbirth will preorder with a considerable discount 
-afterbirth will be awesome.

we showed/tested the game out at pax and the response was extremely positive, especially for greed mode (which we are still currently tuning) so ill switch this post over to the 2nd half of the greed mode update with added video gameplay from pax for those that missed it!

Greed Waves
greed modes main game is fighting off waves of randomly chosen sets of enemies that spawn around the room. these waves ramp in difficulty and continue to stack on top of one another till you hit wave 8, press the stop button or die.
the more waves you string together without hitting the stop button the higher the cash bonus and if you are able to do it without taking damage there is another bonus in it for you. after wave 8 you get a breather to cash in your winnings and the button mysteriously changes to a skull!
image
pressing said skull will start the “boss waves” an easy wave (on par with a basic boss from that chapter)and a med wave (usually an easy level boss with a small mob). you get a lot more time to kill these waves, but depending on how fast you are there is a high chance that the second boss will spawn in along side the first… but you can always sacrifice half a heart to stop the next wave from spawning if things are looking dire.
image
once these boss waves are finished, the exit door will unbar and you will be able to progress to the next level… or you can take a chance with the “nightmare boss wave” in order to unlock the devil room door.
but get this… every single room in greed mode is 100% new, cursed rooms yield totally new surprises, secret rooms have bigger pay offs and the content of devil rooms aren’t exactly what you are use to.. in fact all the pools in greed mode are totally new and have been heavily modded to fit greed mode perfectly.
all in all greed mode will feel like a totally new experience that will not only yield tons of rewards for completing it with each character.. but also features a very unique ending that should have you coming back for more for quite a while.
and here is some actual footage of afterbirth being played for the first time ever publicly by one of the best isaac players of all time, cobalt! (greed mode starts around the 18 min mark )
enjoy!

you only kinda get a taste of greed mode in the video but the further you go the more greed will take over and the theme of this mode will really make itself known to you. risk/reward is a huge theme here and if you get too greedy.. it will bite you in the ass hard. 
next week, i swear.. next week!","1441066200"
"livesound","t5_2remi","If they're in your budget, I'd take a look at DPA's d:facto vocal mic. A really neutral, detailed presentation, without sounding sterile. Very consistent tonality around its axis, which is something some hypercardioid microphones struggle with. This helps a little with the mic hearing stage noise, too. If that's a bit too rich, I also quite like Neumann's KMS105 - still a lovely midrange, with a slightly hyped 'airy' top end. In the UK, the KMS105 is very popular with folk vocalists; a good trade-off between aesthetic, tonal quality, durability, and gain before feedback. My 'money no object' pick for a vocal mic for acoustic music is still the d:facto, though.","1441066200"

This isn't about whether the Lakers are going to be good or not, but it's undeniable that Clarkson did great under him last year, regardless of how bad the team overall was. This is a post about the offense and there is nothing to suggest Kobe is going to run the offense as if he is the PG like OP implied. He's getting reduced minutes, the Lakers know that a new ear for Laker basketball has to begin, and whether that is with Byron Scott or not, it doesn't mean he won't help Russell in the short-term. I'm not saying he is a great coach, but for you to just suggest that all of his team's were shit and the players accomplished everything without his help is pretty ridiculous. ","1441066201"

It probably isn't anything you did or didn't do -- it was her. She may have been too cowardly to end the relationship herself. I would breakup with her...it seems like if you stay in it, it's only going to cause you more pain later on. 

Try not to think that the whole relationship has been fake. It makes it even more difficult. She probably did have feelings and love for you in the beginning and it's possible she still does.

Cains you can get from bounty caches, leorics helm you can get from story mode leoric.

Bounties and rifts are both good as well. I would start with bounties (split) in normal or t1 and then move to rifts once you get a bit stronger.

Still, they were perfectly content in each others company, even if Gerion had to be dragged to the dance floor, where he would clumsily clunk away.

Close behind them was Justin who was almost having a panic attack, being arm in arm a beautiful black haired woman, a few years his senior too. Justin couldn't take his eyes off Reanna. *Gods she's beautiful. Why is she so beautiful. Why can I barely muster a sentence. Why is this something difficult.* Being this close to her didn't help. She smelt very nice. And was very soft.

Myranda stared blankly at the dancers. She should have been here with Garlan, laughing and dancing with her betrothed. Margaery had persuaded Myranda to come for a bit, but being here just made things feel worse. She caught the Queen as she came off the dance floor for a few moments. Myranda muttered apologies for a bit, tears in her eyes, before grabbing her skirts and running our of the room, back to Garlan.

"Maplestory","t5_2rrdo","Started out from scratch a month ago and here are the things i have accomplished. lvl 203, 320k range, 102% boss and made a total of about 6 b in sales (fm). 

In terms of leveling, just refer to the training guide on the right side of Reddit as its pretty accurate but here is the general training guide

lvl 10-30 : Mixed Pink Golems

30-35: Reina Fairy Academy

35-50: Gold Beach

50-60: Reina Strait

55-70: Drakes

70- 140: Romeo and Juliet

Alternatives: Scorpions and Sand Rats: 80-100, 120-140: Pirates

140 - 165: DIPQ

165+: SDH

If you want to prioritize when to farm, your best bet is to do it during 2x exp/drop which is currently occurring every weekend and to use the burning event. The burning event allows you to level 3 times instead of once until your level 100. With this, you should be able to hit 100 in 1-2 hours easily. 

For quest and items: Just look at the side bar for what gear to go for.

General tips: From lvl 20-60, you can get free gear by going to tot's tutorial which will be on the left hand tabs

At lvl 100: Frozen gear which will be given from the event

At lvl 150: You switch to fafnir (weapon) and CRA (Armour) gear

The easiest way to make money for low levels is to vendor the potions from bosses (1m-3m), and to sell the elite bosses drops  (3m - 300m depending on the item and server) in fm entrance. Other ways are merching but that is for when you get a deeper grasp into the game. Ask me for more information in terms of making money. 


As you level, you will eventually make money, make friends, join a guild so create your own pace at which you enjoy Maplestory at. For me playing maplestory isnt about the grind but its the experience. If you have any questions you can always feel free to ask and i will gladly try to help in any way i can. Also, i play in MYBCKN (its multiple worlds merged together).

The mass of society is though. We see it in what they actually do, at least in the modern societies like America and most of Europe, actually, all though written history, around the world, but let's talk about us here in America...

OPPORTUNITY galore...  the only difference is how people USE it.

This tinfoil hat theory that the VAST majority of people choose one way over another being some nebulous bogyman... ""social pressure"", ""patriarchy"" or any other completely non-scientific political assertion... is just that. 

Choice is not a *concept*. It happens every day, and the results of it are clear, even if people so desperately want to ignore what is actually going on in the world around them for their political / personal benefit.

&gt; There is a lot of evidence that it is social so that is the most reasonable conclusion. 

What *eidence* exactly now? The tinfoil hat theories of ""gender pay inequality"", ""rape culture"", etc have been thoroughly debunked again and again, yet still they are paraded out as if they were based on anything other than underhanded politics. Seriously, there is zero science behind any of it.

All good to live and let live. This includes both gays, dikes, in-betweens, whatever. More power to ya!

* Just don't forget that the mass majority of people, very happy with typical gender rolls, deserve *equal* respect.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","OK, this is *not* a BM7/E.  Kinda.  Let's start from the start.  BM7 -- B major 7 -- has the notes B D# F# A#.  So far so good.  When you say ""over E"", that means with E in the bass, so BM7/E would be E in the bass, then the notes B D# F# A# in some permutation.  This chord that you see here is almost that.  You got E in the bass in the 6th string, then B in the 2nd string, B in the 5th, F# in the 4th, A# in the 3rd.  But look at that 1st string.  You'd expect a D#, since that's the only note you don't have yet, but this chord has a G#.  That's kinda weird, isn't it?  This note would cause me to call this chord a BM13/E, not a BM7/E, since the G# is the 13th (same as 6th).  (The fact that the D# is missing shouldn't actually bother you, though.)  *However*, in jazz, BM7 actually means whatever the fuck you want it to mean, so it's fair to call this a BM7/E.

It is, however, not a very descriptive name, because this chord is an EM9#11 (without the 7th, granted).  It's a lydian chord -- lydian just means major with a #4, and 11 is the same as 4.  This is a major-sounding chord -- look at the E, B's, and G# -- with a 9 -- the F# -- and a #11 -- the A# -- which is what makes it lydian.  Technically it doesn't count without the 7th, but in guitar music you can really play only what your hand will let you, so you make do without some of the notes.

Without hearing this chord in context, I'd say it's actually a pretty ambiguous chord anyway.  Don't worry too much about having to decide if it's one or the other -- but *do* worry about understanding why it could be each choice!","1441066210"

"galaxynote5","t5_2ygpt","Her Eric! Great review there, but unlike others I won't contradict you on the battery life topic, but instead tell you why you are getting that terrible battery life and how you can get the iPhone 6 destroying battery life performance. 

Samsung phones have arguably the best displays on the market (super amoled) but as you may or may not know, they consume somewhat more battery so try to keep brightness in auto at all times.

Second, Android apps have a LOT more power in Android than in IOS, and this is a good and bad thing. Good, because it opens the door to incredibly powerful and useful apps like pushbullet and custom launchers, however, it's also a bad thing because it introduces more ways a device can perform worse. iOS ''s main strength is doing everything for the user and keeping him worry free by taking power from him, so you will have to learn quite a few things to get the full potential of Android, but once you do it you will understand just how much power can do for you.

Now coming back to the battery issue,  go to settings &gt; battery and see what apps are consuming the biggest amount of battery and try to either replacing them for a more power saving option or removing them completely. A big battery drainer right now is Facebook (shortened my old Moto X ''s battery life by 20% when installed), so remove it and install a lighter Facebook client like tinfoil for Facebook or Facebook lite, or just stick to the Web interface. Also, a big battery drainer is setting Google's location service to high accuracy,  so go to settings &gt; location and switch it to power saving. 

Also, DON'T INSTALL cleaning apps or Antivirus apps, they aren't needed in Android, but in case you want to delete junk once every few months, try CCleaner (doesn't have any Spyware).

I know this seems like a lot of work at first, but I hope you will soon understand the pros of having so much more power. Check out these apps if you don't believe me!

Somewhere between 20-30 years (or the length of the municipal bond) seems reasonable to me. The penalty for violating this would be to immediately repay the full outstanding public bond on the stadium. 

2. The team should agree to utilize a portion of increased profits (assuming they materialize) to retire the public bond. Thus, if a new stadium results in increased profitability for the owners, a portion of the increase in profitability will retire the debt on behalf of the city. Accounting rules to determine past and future profitability will be agreed to in advance, enforced by a city auditor and arbitrated by a state or federal court.

3. Suns players and owners will be required to perform a certain number of public service hours or spend some equivalent amount promoting leadership and/or youth league sports in economically disadvantaged areas of Phoenix. Team members/owners might also be required to participate in the creation of Phoenix promotional material without additional remuneration.

Solo Queue Rank - Gold 3 (and climbing!)  
  
Role(s) you're applying for - I am comfortable both with jungle and mid and would like the opportunity to work on either role in a dedicated fashion  
  
Your top three champions in that role - Jungle: Lee Sin, Udyr, Jarvan; Mid: Vladimir, Ahri, Diana  
  
Your greatest strengths - Strong understanding of damage, especially in 1v1 situations, and kill potential. I'm also a calm and analytical player and do my best to learn from the situations where I do poorly. I try not to dwell too much on the mistakes of others because at the end of the day, the only one whose actions I can change are my own.  
  
Your greatest weaknesses - I am a very aggressive player, and often try too hard to finish people off instead of backing off.  
  
What you're looking for in teammates - I'd like to get to play with more individuals who are collected and are only looking to improve. I also want to play with individuals whom I feel will trust me, and whom I can trust, when calls are being made. Better to stick to a call than no call at all, even if it's the wrong one.  
Why you should be considered for Azure - It looks like you are looking for individuals who are very much similar in mentality and philosophy to my own, so I have no doubt I would be a good fit and benefit to the team given the criteria listed.

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","&gt; That way someone who is 100% on target will hit 100% of the time. It should not be zero, since a little bit of randomness INCREASES the skill ceiling. If the inaccuracy were non existent, aimers would 100% of the time get away with aiming at the very edge of the head hitbox

And people who ""Miss"" the head completely will get free kills on people who are much more skilled then them, lowering the skill ceiling. 

Anyways, the post was NOT completely about first shot accuracy. Spraying with an AK, even when you compensate perfectly throughout the 30 rounds, has a huge spread near the end. This punishes people who learn the sprays. Simply reduce this to like 1/4th of it's current spread and people who are good will have and advantage in 1v1 or 1vX gun fights. Instead of wildly spraying and hoping to get a lucky dink, you can actually spray transfer correctly using skill and muscle memory you've built over 1000's of hours. Right now, it's mostly RNG. You can do the exact same move twice and be completely right (would get the kill with nospread on) and not get the kill in one instance and get the kill in another. That's not acceptable. Difficult, but masterable rifle play is a hallmark of Counter Strike. 

When i die i want to know it's because someone clicked on my head, and i didn't click on theres in time. Not RNG bullshit from half a map away even though i out aimed him, and still lost. ","1441066213"

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","That's the advantage of plea negotiation.  

Often with crimes of passion, the perpetrator is quite remorseful and may confess.  The confession then becomes the narrative --unless there is clear evidence to contradict the perpetrator's account of what happened, that story will tend to dominate.  It's hard for a prosecutor to prove what was in a killer's mind if the circumstances seem consistent with heat of passion.  A negotiated plea to 2nd degree murder or voluntary manslaughter is quite possible, and also presents an opportunity for the defense attorney to work to mitigate sentence by focusing on personal facts about the defendant: his youth, upbringing, etc.   

I think it's very sad if CG failed to explore this option with her client.

Tranquilizers can cause an animal to seize, their blood pressure to drop too low, their breathing to slow to a stop, an allergic reaction..the list goes on. Overdoses would only happen if the person who calculated the amount to inject was completely inept. 

In a veterinary hospital these effects can be reversed but when you are outside with little to no supplies there can be nothing to stop a bad reaction. One project I worked with put GPS collars on cougars but they did not have any emergency supplies on hand if the cat has a bad reaction to the tranquilizer. I suggested a simple Diazepam suppository but sadly they were too lazy to acquire it. 

Sometimes a necropsy is conducted to determine the cause of death from the tranquilizer but it is usually not done because it costs money. ","1441066216"

A couple of years ago we experienced a sexual awakening and started having regular fulfilling awesome sex.   I'm not complaining at all.   I have felt more love and intimacy in the past two years than in any other time in our twenty year marriage.   

I'm posting because I often read the achievement Sunday posts and always felt our experiences were too vanilla but very satisfying  for both of us.   This weekend was post worthy!  On Friday we were staying in a hotel for an event and we role played that we didn't know each other.   My wife wore a black corset and fishnets.   She applied temporary tattoos.   We had some of the greatest sex in our room.   As we both role played that we didn't know each other and had just met, we said and did things that were not part of our normal routine.      It was incredible!   The next morning we had sex before we left the hotel after asking for a late checkout.   Again awesome.  The drive home only served to give us time to talk about our sexy times.   We had sex that night when we went to bed.    In our forties and having come out of a deadbedroom,  twice in one day is nothing short of a miracle!   On Sunday we were resting and preparing for our week,  my wife enters the bedroom and strips down.   We had some afternoon delight!   

While these experiences may seem tame to some,  this weekend was the greatest sexual achievement of our relationship!    I wanted to share! ","1441066216"

Never said either of these. I said that the information you are providing is common sense and you added nothing. You also titled this as a ""PSA"", which is reddit trope that is constantly misused like this.

&gt;You literally stated opinions and nothing more (the laziest kind of argument)

Arguments are a combination of facts and opinions, I don't know how having opinions is a lazy argument. Your counter-arguments have been telling me that I must only like cosplay/screenshots, or that I'm trolling, truly valid points. Oh and calling me an idiot.

But back to the topic. As Grey said, going digital solved a lot of the issues. In the EU you normally don't have the question for a tip on the machine when you put in your debit card. Some machines still ask when you put in a credit card, but those are phased out quickly.

And this sounds rude for most Americans, but everyone should make a decent paycheck without kindness from others. In some EU countries it is even considered to be rude if you tip. On the other side I understand why companies do that in the US as it doesn't show in the books of the company and they can save on all kind of benefits that need to be payed otherwise. So I wonder when people start to realize that in the US and that they basically became self-employed, but with a contract, a boss and missing a lot the benefits and protections otherwise.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; Wait, it only used one field, refreshed at 60fps? I thought it alternated between rendering the upper and lower fields.

It actually shifts the second field up to overwrite the first field.  This mode is known as ""240p"" today, and was used by pretty much every game console and microcomputer in the 80s.

http://scanlines.hazard-city.de/

&gt; Instead of alternating the lines between fields, they chose a non-interlaced signal, delivering 60 progressive frames per second instead. To keep the format compatible with the millions of TV sets out there, each frame consists of (roughly) 240 lines - same as the fields in the interlaced signals. The progressive signal eliminated flicker, made text more readable and ultimately created what is known today as ""8-bit and 16-bit pixel art"".

&gt;Because the tubes were initially created for interlaced signals, the spacing and resolution of the tube's mask is optimized for 480i signals. If a progressiv 240p signal is fed, every second line is left blank, creating those visible dark lines, which we call ""scanlines"".

Here's a photo of the Apple II monochrome screen.. you can see the blank scanlines causes all vertical lines to be dotted.

Yes I have heard of all those systems.  I have never heard of any of those systems meeting the needs of urban or suburban areas.

&gt; Very poorly I might add. From your link

You make no sense to me, because it started in the 60's and was not released until the mid 80's the government did something wrong?  Comical that you think they just had the idea and it should have been commercial ready a few years later (I guess we just ignore the digital power was not even available).  The first IBM PC and modern commercial fiber optic long distance lines did not become available until 1981.

&gt; Look at the growth once it went into the hands of the private sector:

The government is not suppose to run commercial enterprises, it is suppose to provide the infrastructure to support the commercial sector.  If you can not recognize the government (funding college and private company research) produced a great infrastructure with TCP/IP you either don't understand the complexity involved or you just have a heavy bias.

&gt; 30 years in the government, nearly nothing. 7 years in the private sector, and it's universal.

Again makes no sense, government provided infrastructure and the private sector commercialized it with government subsidies and regulations.

&gt; Maybe a time when 1 in 3 economic decisions weren't made by the people in government

When was this, 1700's, 1800's 1900's?","1441066219"

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","With Legacy you lose the ability to stun enemies, damage them quicker, or reduce their damage. You lose the ability to heal yourself without food too.

For regular enemies the only disadvantage you'll be at is that you actually have to use up food unlike people on EoC. However, for bosses, well...you pretty much won't be able to do them.

&gt;How does that work with people using the normal combat system?

If you're asking what would happen in a Legacy vs. EoC PvP battle, it's exactly what you'd guess. The EoC guy will destroy Legacy guy.

EoC isn't all that bad. You can keep the Legacy interface if you find the EoC interface a bit confusing like I do. I tried to stick with Legacy too until I got tired of not being able to do bosses. Just go to [here](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Revo) and use the action bars it gives you. You won't have to worry about changing them until things get more circumstantial with special enemies and you'll understand EoC more by then.","1441066220"

Some people describe a possession as acting in conflict with the beliefs of the person accusing me of being possessed. I've had christians accuse me of demon possession simply because I'm transgender and I sought medical treatment for it. If that's the definition they're working with, OK I suppose.

"freemasonry","t5_2qn38","I've found within a couple Masonic invitational orders an approach to the Craft which I greatly enjoy. Two of them I have enjoyed more so than my Blue Lodge or other appending bodies. This perhaps has more to do with the men who run them and their members than the official aim of the order itself, or maybe a bit of both. 

One advantage being a filter through invitation. This allows a group to cultivate its membership. However, that could go in a subjectively good or bad direction. I also know of other groups within the same invitational orders of which I wouldn't have accepted, just because of the men who attend, or don't attend. So results may vary by region and the experience is not the same just because the overall Order falls under a certain banner. ","1441066224"

Not sure there has been anything since in the MMORPG world that compares to the early EQ1 adrenaline rush that came with a full guild effort to recover corpses after a Fear wipe back in the days when corpses didn't last long.

Most games nowadays lack the highs that you got in the earlier MMORPGs simply because there aren't corresponding lows or dangers.  If I die in WoW - so what?  Just queue into another dungeon group.  Yay.  

Early EQ1 also had the no easy travel component (which was nerfed a bit with POP unfortunately) that made corpse recoveries all the more challenging and time consuming... and while some frown on the time consuming aspect of it, that time consumption made corpse recoveries ""suck,"" which increased your fear of dying, which added so much to the game as you mentioned.

But if you want to protest say, abortion, you have to protest in a non-intrusive way. You can go in the ""free speech zone"" or secure a permit (which really just lets everyone know what is going on, the crowd to be expected, and whatever other logistical details there are) as opposed to holding arms and blocking med students from attending a class that is even vaguely related to abortion. 

I very much dislike any speech being infringed upon, but damn if it doesn't make life around college campuses much, much easier. 

That being said, I go to college, live, and work in DC and the DC area, and you can protest almost anywhere you want. The one place where you can't (just recently) is on the Supreme Courts ground. You have to stay just outside, but still very much in view. This was in place for the same reason, people were getting too close and violating others rights. But walk downtown for an hour anywhere, and there are protests of some form all over. The right to assemble and protest is still very, very strong in the US, but we do have to be careful about letting ""safety"" creep in against it.","1441066226"

If I am able I will surely try and ""collect"" some experimental subjects for your research, a command spell should do the trick, and a specimen of the inert mummified ones, for your commentaries did make me wonder why were there so distinct kinds of Draugr in those tombs. The source of such siphon should surely be investigated further, I find it most curious how the life force of an individual would retain enough energy after so many Eras, and if we could discover this, it would lead to some most interesting results.

As to the many who would regard the Draugr as a mere form of undead creatures, and I was among their numbers not long ago, they should wait for more conclusive answers before we can reach a definitive solution to this matter, such solid and rigid thinking does not contribute to scientific progress, and I will help as I can your Society to unravel the mysteries of the Dragon Cult.

When I am able and with the promised resources I am sure to make my way to Winterhold, I would only ask your Society to arrange a way for me and the ""delicate"" specimens to enter the city away from prying eyes, so I do not stain your institution's image, as the general population might think we are delving in the Dark Arts.

As an entrepreneur, your job is to make things better.  Your life.  Other people's lives.  You get paid for what you do to make life more bearable.

Right now, my small business makes as much as a minimum wage job, but the income is pretty much passive.  Guess what that means:  I have to work a regular day job a lot less.  I can spend time meditating.  I can spend time with my family.  I can have a much more fulfilling life than if I was a wage slave.  Getting to that point was a lot of hard work, but the pain is over, and I'm better off now, materially and (more importantly) mentally.  Skillful means.

If I find a new project that might improve my material security, I would consider it.  But I understand my motivation:  to not have to worry about money ever again.  Obviously, if your motivation for being an entrepreneur is to become as rich as humanly possible, you're always going to worry about money, no matter how much you have.  That is an attachment that will make you suffer.","1441066230"

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","*Clearly* at odds with the WCF.  I was planning to quote from Ch. 7 and 19 and then, BAM!, you'd already done it.  It is also unfair to press all of the listed authors into this mold.  For example, take a look at what Witsius actually says of the Mosaic:

&gt;What was it then?  It was a national covenant between God and Israel, whereby Israel promised God a sincere obedience to all his precepts, especially to the ten words; God, on the other hand, promised to Israel, that such an observance would be acceptable to him, nor want its reward, both in this life, and in that which is to come, both as to the soul and body.  This reciprocal promise supposed a covenant of grace.  For, without the assistance of the covenant of grace, man cannot sincerely promise that observance; and yet that an imperfect observance should be acceptable to God is  wholly owing to the covenant of grace.  It also supposed the doctrine of the covenant of works, the terror of which being increased by those tremendous signs that attended it, they ought to have been excited to embrace that covenant of God.  This agreement therefore is a consequent both of the covenant of grace and of works; but was formally neither the one nor the other....  If any should ask me, of what kind, whether works or of grace?  I shall answer, it is formally neither; but a covenant of sincere piety, which supposes both.

Hmmm....

But I would only add to what you wrote above, the following:

Romans 9:30-32: *What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works.*

So were the Jews right or wrong to seek righteousness by works?

"everquest","t5_2rosz","Stuns, snares, a lot of other things generate hate equal to `mob's HP / 15` where it caps out to 1200. If you look at tash spells for that level range, its hate override value will give you a good idea what most mobs in that level range will generate for spells that follow that scaling. Thing is that don't follow that scaling are things like resist debuffs (tash would be 10 hate w/o the override, malo is 40 [10 per resist debuffs])

Other things that are special are anything with hate overrides (SHD terror spells) and dispel. Dispel is actually really weird, it seems to add about 50 hate per cast until you have 100 hate.

There is also an initial bonus of ~100, but things like hate override spells and dispel don't have that bonus.

From dev quotes (verified in parses too) heals generate 2 points of hate for every hit point healed capped at 800 for targets below 51 and 1500 otherwise.

So what does this mean? For SHD low HP mobs the terror might actually be better for snare, but snare is generally much better. And yes, all of your snares will generate the same amount of hate on the same mob, so spamming the low level one is better. For PAL root actually is shit aggro generation, adding a whole 10 hate. WAR you pretty much rely  on procs. It's worth noting that spells not from your spell gems are capped at 400 hate. WAR are good at one thing, taking hits, which means they're the raid boss tank. Sadly their aggro gen sucks so you have to wait to engage. Which is why knights are better for group play.

Also beneficial spells are subjected to ""witness checks"" which means they have a chance to generate no hate.


Edit: some more things you asked. A weapon adds hate based on damage (I forget if exactly the same or a percentage or damage + damage bonus, but per swing it adds hate.) Riposte also generate the same hate, so you can mass pull and hit a ripo disc to build lots of aggro.

On E. I answered that above, it depends what you do. (Mainly pulling with SHD terror, tash, dispel and some other things won't get the ~100 bonus.) However, if the target is an animal, initial aggro is capped super low for some reason. I forget what the cap is, but a bard singing can pull aggro off you.","1441066235"
"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","&gt; ""You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too!"" he said. ""The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan — bet it's a witch.""
At this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade.

&gt; ""That lot won't come cheap,"" said George, with a quick look at his parents.
 
&gt; ""Lockhart's books are really expensive…""

&gt; ""Well, we'll manage,"" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. ""I expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand.""

-

&gt; ""Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,"" said George after a while. ""Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything…""

Mrs. Weasley says that they have to buy most of the Ginny's things secondhand, not that they need to buy most of her books secondhand. Which is a bit different, because while Ginny might be able to use Ron's Standard Book of Spells, she can't borrow Ron's cauldron. George specifically names robes and wand, two things that Ginny wouldn't really be able to get as hand-me-downs (and yes, I know that Ron had a hand-me-down wand but I chalk that up to early weirdness).

The biggest cost seems to be the five sets of Lockhart's books, which are obviously a new addition to the list. And yes, they could share but I think Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would rather it didn't come to that.

And it does seem as though Harry and the others use books for multiple years, since in OP, Harry is only assigned two new books (Umbridge's DADA book and standard book of spells, grade 5). ","1441066235"

In response to what /u/halfdog said: 


1) I personally think the depth is fine. Your goal right now isn't to compete in powerlifting. I go way past parallel myself and vary my stance width all the time for both boredom and muscle balance reasons. Some days I go super narrow and others super wide.  


2) He is right about you not loading your hamstrings though. You are putting quite a bit of strain on your knees by doing ATG by bending too much at the knees and its forward travel. I highly suggest you use some knee sleeves if you want to continue doing it this way.


3) He is also right about you being too vertical at the bottom. When you prevent the excessive forward knee travel you will notice your back leaning forward a bit to keep the bar path above your mid foot. The bar path in the side view is actually going diagonally backwards right now and is over your heel at the bottom.


4) Your back is a little hyper extended at the top but its not terrible. It seems like you are bracing yourself well and its very solid coming out of the hole and through the concentric motion. 


Box squats would seriously help you. Your glutes and hamstrings look weak the whole way through the squat. It contributes to all the issues that have been pointed out. 


Very consciously sit back as you squat and keep your knee forward movement as minimal as possible. Set the box as high as you need to feel comfortable while starting. Make sure you don't round your back at all. Just fall on the box if you need to.


Sit on the box for a second or 2 and remain conscious about your straight back and your knee forward movement. ","1441066236"

"ITCareerQuestions","t5_30560","These are all very general statements, I'm aware that everyone has a situation to counter the points. 

Disadvantages - skill stagnation, lower pay (small raises or only COL raises for 30 years straight), less marketable if the company ever closes or gets new owners. In the case of new owners they can very easily see someone there for 5 years likely knows just as much as someone who is there for 28 years, but is paid less and has less benefits. 

Advantages - stable, if it's a .gov or a .edu you'll likely have that same job forever. You'll be at the max cap for benefits like vacation, sick days. etc. 

There is a perfect example of this at my current job. One guy has been in one role for 27 years, he started at the company straight out of high school. Another guy has been there two years. The newer guy is 26. They get paid around the same, the newer guy is getting handed the more difficult projects because they involve more scripting that the older one never learned. In another year that newer guy will be able to write up a nice resume and likely get a new job paying 20+% more easily, the guy who has been there for 27 years would be screwed because he has long since gotten bored and lazy.

* 1 palm-full sugar

Combine the yeast &amp; sugar, then add water and cover w/ plastic, leaving in a warm place. I let the foam reach at least 1.5"" before adding it to the flour mixture.

Mix the salt, flour, and oil in the standing mixer with the dough hook...add things like crushed garlic and herbs, too, at this point. The yeast will eat that shit up during proofing and fart out tasty gas to flavor the bread.

Add all of the water and knead until it gets to the right stage, should be shiny and smooth, then pop into a generously lubed lexan and go from there.","1441066239"

Yes, I know the atmosphere struggled and that Incarnation was having a tough time under the pressure. Today they did not win through pick and bans, that is an absolute fallacy. Yesterday, they certainly didn't. The day before that, their pick and bans were absolute garbage. The one consistency is that Hai was aggressive and effective as a shotcaller. Yes, he's feast or famine, but he is MUCH more often feast, and the fact that they believe in his calls and follow through on what he says regardless is simply something that Meteos would not have been able to accomplish.

Here are the products I've used up this month...

*Satin Care Lavender Kiss shaving gel. Bought this when it was sold at Dollarama. Did an alright job but I didn't care for the smell. WNR

* Korres Body Butter in Guava. I liked the thick, luxurious texture but the smell was overpowering and would linger on my sheets for days. WNR 

* St Ives Fresh Hydration Lotion in Naturally Energizing. A very thin spray lotion. I was curious to try this out, thinking it might save me some time in the mornings. Truth is; it doesn't really. And the smell wasn't very pleasant to me. The contents also ran out very fast. WNR

* Mother's Care Baby Shampoo. Just your regular, generic baby shampoo. I use it as a body wash and as a makeup brush detergent. It does a great job, but I do find that compared to stronger cleansers, I end up having to use more. Still, WR (most definitely)

* Live Clean Age Resist Shampoo. I like Live Clean's shampoo line because most of them are formulated without sulfates. This one smelled really good (kind of musky, à la Gucci Rush) but didn't work as well as the other ones I tried in that line. The Apple Cider Vinegar is my favourite. WNR

* Organix Hydrating Macadamia Oil Dry Styling Oil. Just a hair serum, would use before drying my hair, and I'd find that it would help speed up the drying process. Made my hair soft and less frizzy. WR

*  A-Derma Exomega Emollient Cream. I bought this in a Holiday Set on clearance. I really liked the rich texture, it almost felt like glue. Made my skin feel soft and plump. Quit using it on my face when I noticed that shea butter was part of the ingredients, but it was a great hand/foot cream. I'm pretty sure that this is a sister brand to Avene since the packaging/ingredients are really similar to another cream I own. WR (on sale)

* Garnier Pure Extra-Strong SOS Pen. I used this as a spot treatment on my blemishes. Your regular 2% salicylic acid acne treatment. Contained alcohol, which made my skin react. WNR

* Mediental C Clear Sheet Mask. Got this at the It's Skin store, was only $1.50. Seemed to lighten my blemishes, but didn't moisturize much. Still, WR

* Ja Yeon Royal Jelly Essence Mask. Great, cheap, moisturizing Korean sheet mask. WR

* Benefit They're Real mascara. I liked the sample so I went and bought the full size, but it's been a disappointment. Made my lashes fall out during the removal process. WNR

* No Dark Shadows complexion enhancer in Wow. Great, thin, creamy, peachy-toned concealer. Used as an undereye corrector. Expensive, but WR 

* Maybelline Fit Me Concealer. Another great, creamy undereye concealer. Cheap too! WR!

Madlife guessed exactly that and predict threw the hook at the last moment. If Malphite didn't grab the lantern and Madlife's hook missed, he'd die. If Malphite grabbed the lantern he'd get predict grabbed by Blitz and still die, just like what happened. Even I could analyze this little information and act on it. The angle was also easy to do.

No, because at that time you didn't know anything about your house.  Only after you captured the input can you create the house.  That's what it means by:

    // Use the variables you created as arguments to the constructor

If this line was given to you:

    House myHouse = new House();

Then I think it was a mistake.  It probably should have been:

    House myHouse;

You're changing the value of `buffer`, but never update the value of `bytes` (the length). If you changed the last line to use the buffer length, I think it would work better:

      os.write(buffer,0, buffer.length);

A separate issue that might be worth mentioning is that FileInputStream.read(byte[]) makes no guarantees about how many bytes will be read. It could read 1 byte at a time, for example, and the rest of your code would never find `""&lt;cs371date&gt;""` because it is only examining the input in one-byte chunks. 

A more likely situation might be that `""&lt;cs371date&gt;""` occurs at the 1023rd byte, so that entire string won't be placed into the buffer together. The first read operation will get ""&lt;"" and the second would get ""cs371date&gt;"".

"BritishPolitics","t5_2qo7h","I would agree that trigger warnings used sparingly as a way of warning those there to observe or participate of things to come is appropriate. I have seen many examples of this in university and academic life to the point where even fairly innocuous tasks and topics are covered. There must be limits though, [trigger warnings are apparently being advocated in books.](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/19/us-students-request-trigger-warnings-in-literature) There is the deeper issue of students who are by the time they are in university, adults being unable to deal with even discussion of unpleasant issues. It's a coddling where children are trying to hold onto the innocence of childhood while being an adult. It's wrong because if you don't expose yourself to any dangers, harms or unpleasantness then you will be far more vulnerable when bad things happen. Someone who has never suffered or known the predations that people are capable of is far more likely to freeze up or subject themselves to unnecessary harm due to inexperience. Learning about such experiences in a safe environment is already guaranteed in an academic setting. Safety is however not guaranteed by hiding from the truth.

This however brings up the issue of who these trigger warnings are for really. Is it for those who have been abused and are more likely to recount an experience or is it to protect people who have not had unpleasant experiences? The words imply that its for those who have experienced such issues but it seems to me to be far more sinister in that it is used to stop people from being able to observe or participate in anything with adult themes. 

I feel I have run the course of my own thoughts on the matter at this point but I am interested in anything further you may have to say on the matter.","1441066247"

"INDYCAR","t5_2sdeq","IndyCar has so many FCY's because it's approach to incidents is to deploy a safety crew by truck to the site of the incident. This requires that the safety car be out to lead the cars around the workers. WEC and F1 take a different approach; they have workers spread around outside the track to respond on foot to any incidents. This helps minimize the number of safety car deployments. 

The IndyCar approach makes sense in the historical context of forming out of an oval based series. Local yellows aren't practical on an oval track, so FCY's were necessary anyway, so why not have one really good team on truck instead of a bunch of workers spread out along the track. This setup then carries over to the road Courses. NASCAR is the same way, except they race so rarely on road courses that it's not as noticeable. ","1441066247"

I decided against creating a second playbook just for deployment, but used tags to say which tasks were for deployment. 

Realistically, this only affects how you call your playbook, ie with --tags=&lt;tag1&gt;,&lt;tag2&gt; etc

I would separate app deployments to be flexible so that I could deploy different apps to different servers when necessary.

If your 3 apps are strongly dependent on each other, then maybe you don't want to split them.

If the cron job needs an executable that's only there after deployment, then it should be include in your deployment.

For your sql question, do you scripts execute tasks that only make sense if you going to deploy your app? as an example does it make sense to have a ""appuser"" and/or ""appdatabase"" if you didn't deploy the app?

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","It doesn't matter, as long as you continue to consume even JUST dairy or JUST chicken/eggs, the abusive factory farming practices will continue. Like I said, you wouldn't dream of compromising about murder so why is this any different? Killing 10 people is a bit ""better"" than killing 20 people, but it's unacceptable. And really, is it better? Some would argue it isn't any different in a more spiritual sense.

The animal industry is a complex machine, it isn't like going into the wild and killing less animals because a few people decided to go vegetarian. As long as people continue to consume animal products the mass murder system will continue. They won't breed any less animals or make their daily killing quota any smaller unless we all give it up entirely.

There is nothing ""elegant"" about veganism...in fact, I often feel embarrassed to bring it up because there's such a weird and hippie connotation to it. Keep in mind that filet mignon is considered elegant....as is caviar, and fancy restaurants that serve meat. People like to think that this is something that can be fixed slowly and not fully, when it's just not true. There are a few things in the world that are never OK, and in my opinion this is one of them. Do your research instead of resorting to Straw Man arguments.","1441066250"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","For me, I realized after an embarrassment of a relationship that it was unfair to expect someone else to like me when I didn't even like myself.

I stepped away from the pressure of the dating game (which wasn't amounting to much anyway), and started working on me.  Recognizing the parts of my life that were bringing me down and where my strengths were, what I enjoyed doing.  I realized that there was a lot of negativity tied into family and just where I was at, so I made it a focus to move away.  I found something I enjoy doing (writing) and gave my all to it, and I made it a job.  I evaluated my priorities and what I wanted out of life and decided I would much rather be a career writer with a modest income than do the 9-to-5 grind, and I would make sacrifices to do it, in terms of the investment for the (relatively, objectively) low reward.

As I've achieved those things, I've switched from the broad strokes to the particulars.  Dieting (wasn't obese, just overweight), exploring hobbies, working on side projects, making my apartment nicer, new addition by new addition.

But I like where I'm at, at this point.  I like *me*, now.  I'm comfortable with my own companionship, I live without dread of tomorrow, part of that is having no debt, but part of it is the abstract decisions and broader choices.  When opportunities arise, I can (and have) approach a girl and be myself, being completely upfront about what I want out of life, and be okay if we don't mesh together in that respect.","1441066250"

(8) The Interaction of Replacement/Prevention Effects, in terms of identifying the affected object or player, and which player gets to choose how an event may be modified.

(9) How the game handles State-Based Actions, or even what the more common state-based actions are that apply to most games.

(10) Copying a Permanent or a Spell, in terms of what are the “copiable values” of the object and how the game handles copies.

"Diablo3DemonHunters","t5_2w1a3","Actually RCR doesn't give 'less', it always does exactly what it says on the tin: if you have this 10% RCR, your skills will cost 10% less resources than without it.

The absolute value of the reduction in resource cost will diminish yes, but it does not have any diminishing returns so to speak. It will let you cast 11% more spells (1/0.9) than without it.

In fact, due to inherent resource generation of DH, the more RCR you have, the more powerful it becomes because you are slowly approaching the point where your hatred spending rate and your regeneration rate becomes closer, and the amount of multishots you can use before you absolutely must use skills to hatred generator increases very quickly.","1441066253"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Quick edit - [here's](http://i.imgur.com/4ytT4ir.jpg) the scene in the anime so you don't have to go back looking for it, for comparison's sake.

それででてきたのがこれなのか 
2015/08/04  「ゴー宣道場」圧巻の女性発言  
https://www.gosen-dojo.com/index.php?key=jo5dmt125-1998#_1998　　
&gt;今回の「ゴー宣道場」で一番驚いたのは、門弟女性からの
「これから日本が海外に自衛隊か軍隊を送り出すときは、
国が管理する慰安婦を伴うべきではないか？待遇を良くすれば、
それを望む女性だっているのではないか？」という発言だ。    
国のために死ぬ兵隊を思いやるこの発言には、女性の母性を
感じて感動した。  
場の空気に流されない、このような自分の頭で考えた発言が
出てくるのが「ゴー宣道場」のひとつの成果だろう。
  
よしのりは称賛してるけど、はたから見れば男性を戦地に行っても性欲が我慢できないものとして見てたり、自分がやるわけではない、あくまで他力本願の無責任な偏った言い分にしか思えない   
こんなものを「思想」として称賛してる「道場」ってあんまり質はよくなさそうに思えるんだが

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I feel the exact same way, I'm currently ~18 months into a PhD and I've been struggling with it from the very beginning.
It all started when I moved back home from working abroad to be with my girlfriend (now my ex). When I came back I was very successful in getting job offers but none of them were geographically close to where my girlfriend lived so I decided to apply for a PhD position at the University. I got offered the position and then got dumped (we had been together 5 years). That is the milestone at which I fell into a depressed state, although looking back there were other periods in my life where I had a slight depression (in my teenage years I never really fit in at school, I was always distant) - but none of them lasted this long.

Your description of feelings of inadequacy and the subsequent cycle of procrastination all ring true in my case also. I live in constant fear of meetings, emails, phone calls, and deadlines. I try to start projects as early as possible but like you they always get rushed in a last minute attempt to finish. In the last few months I've missed two major deadlines and it feels like I am holding my whole group back. We have a project review coming up in the next two weeks (panel of experts picking us apart) and I am struggling to put together a 20 minute presentation of what I have done so far. I have achieved nothing. I am currently the weakest point in the group and I am sure I'll get taken up on this in the review meeting in two weeks time.
A few months ago, in the lead up to my two missed deadlines, I would get regular anxiety attacks where it felt like my heart was about to explode in between bouts of depression. My parents are worried, I've called my mother during my anxiety attacks before and at her suggestion I went to the counselling service at the University. I went for one session but haven't been able to go since as it is closed for the summer months - although that one session wasn't very helpful.

I have been in this state since I started the programme and have approached my supervisor about it once, about 8 months in. Luckily enough he is a very reasonable and approachable guy. I told him I wanted to quit the PhD as I felt I was incapable of completing it. After our meeting I agreed to give it another try but nothing much has changed since then. I'm going to try counselling again when they open up at the start of term.

Just wanted to post this to try to offer some solidarity, I'm in the exact same position.","1441066260"

Like the whole issue is much more complex than ""hurr durr Ghengis Khan did it so everyone should be able too"", but it's easy for racists who want to believe to draw these very simple a--&gt;b conclusions, because doing otherwise would require actual thinking.

Then went again on Saturday with my gf, literally just walked around and couldn't enjoy it with all the lines, ended up leaving after seeing Ninja Sex Party and selling our tickets to a redditor and ate in Chinatown. The lines are probably too crazy now that LoL NA wasn't hosted here, that more people actually go in lines instead of viewing the tournament.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","I can't comment from the designer side, but as a backer, here are a few things that make it more likely I'll Kickstart the game:

* **Good price:** The price for the game + stretch goals tier is lower than what I'd expect to pay for the game normally, or at least not higher...  That means CSI or Amazon prices, not MSRP.

* **Good stretch goals:** The stretch goals add more cool content or significantly improve component quality in the game.  For example, stuff like the new decks of cards from the Pillars of Eternity tie-in card game or the various new cards that are always stretch goals for Among the Stars Kickstarters are good.  ""We'll add another player to this game that's not designed for more players"" or ""Backers who also pledge for this add-on will get bonus content"" or ""We'll make a documentary about making the game"" or similar things - stretch goals that don't add to the game itself - I couldn't care less about.

* **Professional look:** The Kickstarter should look like you know what you're doing.  It should showcase attractive art, be well-written, have a good intro video, etc.  This is just a basic ""Do the designers seem like they have a clue about how to do things"" criterion, and it makes checking it out more pleasant.

* **(Mostly) Finished Design:** I'm not going to back the idea of a board game.  Everything besides art and final rules tweaks should be basically done.

* **Clear rules explanation:** I need to know what your game is like.  That means there should be previews, rule videos, details rules descriptions, a preliminary rulebook pdf...  Enough of these things that I know how your game plays.  In particular, I really like to see outside previews, because it gives me a chance to hear from someone who won't be making money off the game and thus doesn't have a stake in selling me the game...  And the more previews, the better.  Also, if the rules explanation comes from a rules video, it should be relatively short - my likelihood of caring enough to watch it (and thus, to potentially back the game) drops quickly as the amount of time I have to sink into it increases.

Edit: Just to mention...  Some examples of the board game Kickstarters that I think did a good job are Pillars of Eternity: Lords of the Eastern; Artifacts, Inc.; Among the Stars; and Dead Men Tell No Tales.  Also Project Eternity, Torment: Numenera, Feng Shui 2, and the various 13th Age Kickstarters, for stuff outside the board game space, though for those my criteria are also a bit different.","1441066266"

I like the theory that it had Space AIDS and he would now be incapable of curing it. I see very little other reason. Lord knows how many creatures he has around the lab. It's not like he was cleaning shop or anything. He kills the alien and puts himself under the laser. Up to this point he's seemed totally lucid. He's not fumbling with anything (he skillfully assembles the annihilator), he's not bouncing in and out of consciousness, he seems fine (comparatively). He doesn't look like he's on the verge of passing out. Then, when he puts his head under, he just can't bring himself to do it. It's perfectly understandable that someone will be dead set on committing suicide, and then once they put the barrel to their head, they can't pull the trigger. Killing yourself is hard. Collapsing to the table and lying there for 24 hours motionless is easy. Suicide is all about ending pain. Sometimes the pain of death can't be justified against the nagging emptiness of the days. And not necessarily physical pain. There's a big lump in your throat and a heavy weight in your stomach when your body is physiologically come to terms with ending your own life. You just sort of coast like ""yeah, I'm going to kill myself"". Then when your mind senses you're in immediate danger your fight or flight senses kick in and adrenalin gets dumped. You get really antsy and nervous. Maybe not for everyone, but it's very possible.

No matter how much you may have contemplated suicide or pondered it over, actually doing it is something completely different psychologically. I don't think Rick has it in him to be too numb to care. He's narcissistic, self-important, and demeaning to everyone else. That type of personality doesn't manifest in the same type of person that thinks they have nothing and nothing to live for. We all get sad. We all get pushed to the edge. But what I described above is what keeps most people alive. It's only the empty, sad, pained few that go through with it.

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","Ah, this thing. DC is not done via keyword, it is done via a conditional function. SkyRe/Perma use these things as well. Let me explain. 

You can set up an effect on spell in CK, with a condition, like IsRaining, or GetItemCount. IsDualCasting is one of them; as an example, in SkyRe, fear spells work on Daedra only if you dual-cast them. 

In this mod, this won't work; the custom spells are actually a dummy spells which do nothing; a silently running script in background is casting a set of five sub-spells when it detects that you have fired this dummy spell, through a Cast function, which, as far as I am concerned cannot be set to dual-cast (and if I'm reading CK wikia correctly, it wouldn't work anyway). 

I have modified the spell-casting monitor: if you are DC now, left hand's spell do nothing, and right hand fires regular spell, but a perk is given to boost magnitude/magicka cost. So you are basically firing a more powerful version. As a result, the IsDualCasting won't fire. However, player has now an invisible perk which activates when player is DCing a custom spell. 

So, in the patches, one would simply had to substitute the IsDualCasting with HasPerk. At least, I hope, cos I didn't do any tests yet :D","1441066277"

I don't think I know anyone personally who's been tortured. Another issue is that victims of sexual assault are often already blamed and treated unfairly. Another is that sexual assault is super common by people you already know and trust which makes it worse. All this put together means it has a much larger part in the average person's life and has a lot more awareness around it. So, no one is saying it's worse than torture, it's just more prevalent. And no one is saying it's worse than murder, which it isn't, it's just that it's not being handled in a way that people are happy with.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Well dropping bombs from a plane is a step back from land invasions, and drone strikes are another step back from that. You can remotely kill almost anyone in the world without even risking a single pilot, much less battalions of troops. 

So I think it's right to focus on drones to an extent because of the potential they hold for indiscriminate killing. If you think about the Vietnam war; many of the protesters weren't rallying in support of Vietnam. They just didn't want to risk American lives. Now we don't have to risk American lives in the same way, so the public's view on warfare is even farther detached from the people we kill and the conflicts we're involved in. 

Overall I agree that the issue should be on war in general. At this time I don't think any serious candidates are advocating open warfare tho, so the name of the game is drone strikes. 

I assume you're not asking why imperialism in general is a socialist concern. ","1441066287"

At the time I certainly considered this man my father (I have an assignment from Kindergarten that was write about your dad - I chose him.) and he and my mother had another child, my brother. 

One of my earliest memories is listening to a song called Mexican Power. It was a cool song, and to be honest I can't really remember mucheck of the lyrical content, except the title. 

If, as a white man, I tried to affiliate myself with white power, what would that tell people? Most people (myself included) would probably assume that the person was racist. What if they just wanted to feel pride in their race?

I think it's eas to understand why white people feel that racism is more acceptable towards white people. If a black man called me a cracker, it would certainly not receive the same response if I called that man a nigger. Even though they are both made as attacks on someone's race. Sure, you could say that nigger carries a far worse connotation, but I think that argument is horse shit. I am not responsible for the past crimes of my race.

All I see is ""yeah, feminists can be toxic""  ""yeah, KIA makes some good points sometimes""  ""yeah, social justice can seem cult-like""  Do y'all need to re-read privilege 101?  Politeness is a tool of white supremacist capitalist patriarchy to silence voices of dissent. Voices which have endured constant hardship and are from the get go in a much more emotionally fragile state than your typical privileged white campus male with his feathered cap and his logic.  It is 100% the job of the privileged ally to educate themselves on these hardships, learn where they come from, and learn not to take them personally when engaging in social justice.  It is not the job of POC and women to run a god damned pre-school for these people. If they reject our message and form reactionary groups that harass and destroy it is 100% their fault.  This rhetoric of ""I agree with the message but not the methods"" was employed by people who wanted to destroy the Civil Rights movement and discredit Dr. King. With all do respect: hell naw. What ever happened to this?

Everything else you mention is some kind of wish fulfillment, and some of it is just as bad, but that's not what this video is about. She's focusing on one kind of bad. 

The things you mentioned that you can do in those games you can't do in real life without getting into trouble OR they are just simply impossible. They are fun but forbidden. She is saying that making it so you can fulfill a wish to fuck objectified women or see them naked is a weird thing for video game creators to spend time on by creating art and code and so on when they could literally create anything else instead to provide fun or payoff for the player. Or, at the very least, they could give those women in those games some characterization and agency, an inner life equivalent to the male characters and show them choosing their destinies. Instead, the agency is the player's, or the character in the game, and you help that character earn an object as a reward.

The bottom line is that these are works of art that must be created from nothing - so everything you see or don't see, experience or don't experience in the game world was a choice by the creator(s) made with some goal in mind. The criticism is of those choices and those goals, not the art itself. ","1441066289"

I've got a bunch of services running on well known (hardcoded; don't ask) IPs in my environment. I can move them around, or anycast them because all of those targets are on host loopback interfaces.

"canada","t5_2qh68","So much misinformation and misleading statements on that site it makes Donald Trump look honest. I'll stick to this one....

&gt; An example of this is the African nation of Malawi, one of the 10 poorest nations in the world. Before Harper, Canada was the 6th largest aid donor to Malawi, and the largest supplier of school books.

&gt;  After coming into power, he closed the Canadian embassy in Malawi and took the country (alongside 6 other African nations) off of Canada's aid priority list. Harper cut aid to Africa in half, before finally freezing all foreign aid in 2010.


First of all here is a [quick reference](http://cidpnsi.ca/canadas-foreign-aid-2012-2/) to our contributions of foreign aid. Aid was not cut off to Africa in 2010 in any way, shape or form. 

In fact Harper has been widely praised the world over for his [3.5 billion dollar initiative](http://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/development-developpement/mnch-smne/summit-sommet/index.aspx?lang=eng) to improve women and children's health, it will likely prove his historical legacy. 

As for stopping funding to Malawi? That is 100% true but this site conveniently doesn't tell the whole story...the entire international community also suspended all aid to them at that time because the government had just passed a law that made homosexuality illegal, was expelling diplomats who protested it and was found to misusing the funds.

The OR is nice because the patients are asleep and you are all working together as a team (no more paging the resident for orders and waiting for a call back!) You still use a lot of your assessment and nursing skills, but there are also a lot of technical aspects and types of equipment. Your work as a photography technician would actually be a great asset here!

I would also caution you, though, not to expect a pat on the back after every case. Don't get me wrong...I feel appreciated by the surgeons a lot of the time, but there are always some who expect you to bust your ass for their case and still complain.

GET HIM INTO CLASSES. Most if not all puppy classes will allow him in at 11 weeks, and no other puppies will have had all of their shots, but as long as everyone is at least started, you're fine. Puppies are great at communicating with each other and teaching eachother bite inhibition.

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","I don't do the thumbnails for our channel (that's all /r/kupakins ), but we did some research on them. First off, we use Photoshop to create them. The max resolution for thumbnails is 720p, so you can create a template off that. You want to make sure that the image conveys what game your playing and what you are. We don't have our logo or anything, but at least our faces, the title of the game, and maybe splice in a few characters. When we try to find content from the game to put into the thumbnail, we usually google ""game PNG"", replacing game with the title or maybe even a character from the game. This will yield some some images that are cleaner and can be added to the thumbnail easily. I like thumbnails a bit more simple. I've seen some that have way too much shit going on, and it looks like a mess. We keep it at a set of thumbnails per series, since it kinda cuts down on the confusion as to part number or what we are playing. Dynamic thumbnails are nice, but honestly when your dealing with a long series, it's so much easier to plug a number into a preset than make a new one from scratch every time, but whatever works for you is good.

For Stalin vs Trotsky, if I remember Trotsky correctly he would be a bit further from the authoritarian line than Stalin.

Regardless, I feel like I should mention that I never advocated the political spectrum as some perfect measure of political ideology.

On headphone forums, people really tend to nitpick the higher end headphones. As a result the differences seem bigger than they actually are.  Personally I think you would be doing a disservice to yourself to dismiss the lcd-2 as a choice over something like the fazors.

Leviticus is irrelevant. It's simply a passage chosen by the users here because it could be the passage Rau is following. 

The FACT is that Rau has repeatedly said that he cannot drive this bus as a result of his Christian beliefs. Leviticus simply has a verse that condemns homosexuality. But again, that's neither here nor there. There is absolutely no proof of anything with Leviticus. There's just Rau bitching about a bus due to his Christian beliefs.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Well, first to address the ethnic concerns. Approximately 50% of American Orthodox are converts. A lot of the frequent Orthodox posters here are converts, actually. The ""ethnic"" titles are actually jurisdictional tags, mostly. Russian churches tend to be part of the OCA or ROCOR, Greek,part of GOARCH, and so on.

Now, that's not to say that there are no ethnic ties - there are, of course there are. It's unavoidable, especially given the canonically irregular situation in the USA. There shouldn't be overlapping jurisdictions like there is, but that how it is. We're slowly working on regularizing the situation.

I think it is important to recognize that, despite the Greek-ness or Russian-ness of many Orthodox, many other Orthodox in America are totally American. 

Anyway, regarding an undirected worship, you won't find that here. It's totally directed. We're very high church, especially compared to most protestant groups.

Either way, I do encourage you to at least come and see what we do, besides make Greek food, even if you ultimately decide you can't stand it. It sounds like it will be very different to anything you've done before. (Also, [church locator](http://assemblyofbishops.org/directories/parishes).

You're eighteen. You have a _long_ time before you need to start worrying. But what you do now can definitely program your future behaviors.

Settling for someone that you don't like is a good way to get trapped in a string of sad relationships.

Dating, as it's designed, is for figuring out whether or not you want to be with someone until one or both of you is dead. You don't need to date this person! You already know that would be a nightmare.

And your general dislike of her aside, she doesn't seem like a very good person.  Her behavior is a warning of potential future abuse.  

If it's the physical intimacy you're looking for, imagine how you'll feel six months into a relationship with her, when someone awesome and into you comes around, and then goes away because she doesn't want to encourage you to cheat.","1441066299"

* Jay says Adnan calls when he's *outside Jay's house*, not while he's at Woodlawn. 

* Jay thinks Adnan got Stephanie a card for her birthday. Is he making that up, or did Stephanie and/or Adnan misinform him?

* The detectives wrote down, ""Pay phone call history?"", but then apparently thought better of that horrible idea, and never looked further into it

* The Rt. 40 diner? Why is that being mentioned during the ride-along?

* Who is calling Krista at 5:38 if Jay is still at NHRNCathy's at that time? And how is Jay still at Cathy's at 5:47, if Adnan's call to pick him up from track practice could not have been made any later than 4:58pm?

* The part about Adnan flipping through prom pictures before tossing them in trash -- not part of any previous versions of events told by Jay. 

* Jay says Adnan threw Hae's weekly planner away - but the weekly planner was found in Hae's car.

* Jay describes **two** separate trips to Patapsco State Park that he and Adnan made together. And yet both trips disappear by the time Jay testifies trial. Why would Jay tell the detectives about going to Patapsco twice that day, when going even once would be impossible? It's almost as if he's just making stuff up as he goes along.","1441066300"

Now we get to deal with a ""distraught"" De Gea for another year, who will sign a precontract with Real in January, and with our next best keeper being Romero. Or Valdes, of anyone even knows what's going on there anymore. 

I know people think De Gea will have no choice but to play well because of the Euro, but it's going to take him months to get his head back in the game, November at the earliest, and by the time March or April rolls around, he'll probably already have his head in Madrid (just like this past year).

It is an entertaining saga for a neutral because it's absurd, but it doesn't help United at all, and was a massive waste of time, and was incredibly cruel on De Gea. I don't even really like the guy anymore because of the saga, but he didn't deserve this. People shouldn't be treated that way.

"AoTRP","t5_30v7r","""An infected?""

Eric felt confusion. He looked out the garage, sure that Daniel had meant the monsters. Eric had never bothered to give them a name, since he assumed they all already had names. Names that they just never bothered to say. 

""You mean the monsters? And my red eyes... blue?""

Eric felt puzzle pieces sliding into place, as if the mystery had finally been solved. In reality, Eric had just truly realized what the mystery was, but he wasn't focused on that right now. 

""Daniel, my eyes have been red since birth. People always used comment on them, saying it was an unnatural eye color.""

Eric chuckled a bit, knowing it probably wasn't a situation to laugh at, but he couldn't help it. Had he simply been mistaken for a monster? No, Eric had been raised to be one since birth. A monster that could hold its own and defeat its enemies. So hearing that his whole predicament during this apocalypse was just a big misunderstanding was pretty funny, in a cynical way.

""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm not infected, or at least I haven't been-""

Eric stopped in his tracks. There it was; the mystery was finally revealing itself. Eric didn't know, *couldn't* know if he was infected. His eyes were naturally red, and he'd have no way of knowing in the future (or, more importantly, right now) if he was infected or not. With that in mind, Eric's head suddenly sank, a deep fear in his heart. He might become an infected. He might become even more monstrous than he already was, and he might drag people around down with him. Suddenly, the cut from that red-eyed crow's talon felt like a burning wound, instead of a mere battle scar. Eric gripped his left arm, where had been struck, and his breathing became shallow. He wasn't turning, he knew this. But he was scared. He was scared, and felt like it was a reaction coming weeks too late to his mind. 

""I... um............""

Eric stayed silent for a moment, before sitting down. 

""Fuck........ *fuck*...........""

Daniel probably didn't know what Eric was going through. No, he probably did, but he couldn't know *why*, and so he may as well not know what. Eric turned up to him and nodded.

""I'll... don't worry, I'll keep the gas mask on... you're right. Better keep the virus away from everyone else, just in case, right?""","1441066302"

&gt; ""We'll have a great wall. We'll call it the Great Wall of Trump,"" the real estate mogul told Fox Business recently. Source:National Journal

Does that sound like a man who's taking his image seriously? What about when he said McCain sucked because McCain got himself captured and tortured, and that guys who managed to avoid being shot down were the real heroes? Or when he said that Obama should meet with the leader of China in a McDonalds and buy him a Big Mac? 

I'm not an American. Maybe he's serious. Maybe, despite being a billionaire businessman, he has no idea that building and manning a wall along the Mexican border would be more expensive that building and manning a Mars colony. Maybe he's not aware that a labor shortage from inevitable demographic changes is timed for around the 2030s and that having young earnest bodies will ease the crunch from all the retiring baby boomers. 

Maybe he actually does believe he can make America great by starting some kind of quixotic trade with China. I'll give him credit if he does whip out a secret plan on how he's willing to risk a worldwide recession to destabilize the Politiburo. Maybe shutting down relations with the forefront regional power in the world isn't as shitty as it sounds. What it does sound like is that he flipped through a couple of reports on China's use of economic policy to maintain internal stability, and then doodled out his policy planks on a napkin.

Yeah, he won't be able to brag about having a liquid cooler, but an R9 390 is waaay more powerful than an R9 380. It would mean the difference between playing at high graphics and playing at ultra graphics. Plus, an R9 380 at 1440p won't work well for any AAA games.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Why are most of the comments saying you shouldn't be entitled to more rewards/ to go farming other things for it? 

I think it's quite logical, there should be DB drops from Grift guardians, like most bosses do (especially since it is supposed to be the combined amount of drops the regular mobs would've dropped).

The fact more people are realizing the issue only now is because before there was no real need for DBs (at least since Grifts), but now it is just as good (if not better than) forgotten souls. 

You can say the new upgrade legendary is a DB sink, just like the reroll legendary is a forgotten soul sink, and that using the sage set gives you a bunch of DBs especialy if you farm a bunch of regular rifts/bounties. I mean I was also gonna go ahead and say something along those lines.

But it's not about that. Grift should reward you with a certain amount of DBs. And if you follow their way of bunching all drops on the RG, with the current distribution, it should be around like 3-6 for mid range Grift levels (probably a low estimate too).

Bounties/rift would still be better to farm them, you should still consider the upgrade to legendary recipe a mat sink recipe instead of the norm and something you should be able to spam easily to aquire all your gear in no time, but as far as what the rewards system is with Grifts :

"ProtectAndServe","t5_2ug10","I think this is a good response.  When I was working with my service dog, I used positive reinforcement 99% of the time.  But, he was a big shepherd, and was almost my weight.  He developed a strong ""chase"" urge for a certain shape of taxis, which led to him dragging me into a busy street once---I yanked him back immediately and spanked him once on the flank shouting 'NO! Bad dog!""  I can't say that this hurt him in any way, nor did it have any particular good training benefits though.

After analyzing his behavior, I realized that I had inadvertently created it by hiring a weekly dog-cab to take us to the beach/dog park.  He had such strong positive reinforcement with a certain ""look"" of car that he would lunge to get in them.  So it was my fault, but it took me some mental detective work to figure out what I did wrong in his training.  (It was even harder to fix.)  

GSD's/Malinois are really, really, smart---some sources say as smart as a three-year-old child.  They need an alpha handler who can control, dominate (and I mean this in the ""pack"" way), and appropriately discipline and control them.  Otherwise, you've got a...what...$9,000-$15,000 dog who can't do the job and has to be washed out.

As in all video situations, I'd withhold judgement until I heard all sides of the story.  It's hard to see what exactly is going on besides a leash jerk, a swat with the leash, and a boot to the butt--soccer style which isn't ""stomping on the dog"", as the article said.

Edit: Two things of note after rewatching the video.  After the dog is led away from the door, his tail is up as are his ears and head--he is attentive to his handler and not showing submissive or fearful behaviour.  This leads me to think that this is not a case of dog abuse but just a bit of negative reinforcement on the part of the handler.  If this were an ""abused dog"", we would see completely different body language.","1441066308"

Ok figured it all out now,click download in blue in the above article (Halo Online Easy Install Pack - One zip with all files necessary for multiplayer and setup instructions) article at the top of this page and basically follow step 1 &amp; 2 only then just go to https://github.com/FishPhd/DewritoUpdater/releases and download these 2 files dewrito.json &amp; DewritoUpdater.exe,so just copy them both from the bottom Download section of the page and paste them into the halo folder of your extracted game.Then just go to the halo folder of the game and run DewritoUpdater.exe and wait until it says update then update and then after it has updated click play,now you can send to desktop as a shortcut to play the game from this point forward your sorted and playing it.If you still can't use it go into the tpi folder and jst run both installers for .net etc and it will maybe run from the desktop shortcut or launcher then.Get tunngle vpn account at tunngle.net by registering,and download the client for windows and login then search for a halo online section (lobby) and click the halo online name,this puts you in halo online so then in the halo online game itself either host or join a game join will work only if players are present in tunngle halo online section at that time of course.Spread the word and get a following going if you can.Or simply host your own private games for friends parties etc.Hope this helps struggling people out,i had no clue what i was doing in a matter of hours i had figured this out by chopping and adding bits of articles in foums including this one together so it's not rocket science really,it seems daunting but actually it's simpler than you realize. :)","1441066311"

In return, I reap the benefit of a happy and rewarding relationship.

However, on closer look, brass-colored thread had been embroidered in the azure cloth near the wrist, the waist and the high collar. On his chest, where his heart lay, three brass buckles were attached in the manner of the sigil of House Buckler. The shirt was tucked inside the trousers and around his waist was a thick leather belt with a brass buckler. All brass was rough and unpolished.

His cloudy blue eyes wandered the room. Since him and his father had been refused for Reanna Baratheon, Argon Buckler had made his son understand the importance of finding a partner.

One thing that I really did like, though, was the monster, Mary Shaw.  There was nothing really elaborate about her look.  Old lady hair, pinned up; long, conservative-looking dress; wrinkly, gray hands; and a wide, evil smile.  Oh, and her creepy voice.  Each of these things are simple, but they came together in a way that was quite effective and chilling. 

And her preferred method of killing was memorable and unique.  She tore out her victims' tongues, stretching their faces into a permanent look of horror in the process.  From then on, she owned her victims' voices, and perhaps their souls as well.

"tamrinm","t5_38srp","The funny thing is that with that plot, they could've gotten away with trying to separate themselves from the more recognizable YA staples, but the trailer just read like that Twitter parody account that mocks the genre's tropes. With every ""the Others"" they dug themselves a little deeper, lol (On that note, poor Chloë Moretz. Her skills are wasted role after role. Seems like Hollywood can't come up with interesting things for actresses her age.)

But yeah, Wes totally makes the difference. I think I've said this before, but the only thing that made me go watch TMR was that the trailer caught my attention, and I saw people were saying good things about the movie. I didn't like the book, so I wouldn't have bothered otherwise (well, eventually yes, because of the Spider-Man thread, but you know what I mean).

I'm just so bummed that Star Trek's return to the silver screen wasn't more universally appreciated.  J.J. did his job, and turned Star Trek into a ""popular"" thing that resonated with ""the normal people"" audience... but he did so at the expense of Star Trek fans of varying degrees.  Some Star Trek fans loved them, others felt ""meh"" about them, and others still felt downright badly about them.

You know how, when you're shopping for stuff on Amazon, and the review breakdown is like ""this percent of people thought this was a 5-star item"" and ""this percent of people thought this was a 4-star item"" and so on?  Well, normally when I'm getting something, I'm happy to add the percentages for four and five stars into one, general ""this percentage of people felt that this was a Good Product"" category.  I realize that the 4-star revieweres maybe weren't wowed by it like the 5-starrers were, but that in general, they were satsified.  *At absolute worst*, X% of people felt that this was a functional product.

I couldn't do that with Star Trek.  To me, as a fan, Star Treks Insurrection, Nemesis, and Enterprise (the series) were sufficiently underwhelming enough to cast severe doubt on the viability of the franchise.  I don't fault studio execs for pulling the show, Rick Berman was running it.  And while Berman arguably shared the *greatest* amount of the Star Trek ""vision"" with its creator, that... I think... became a liability.  The problems with Star Treks Insurrection, Nemesis, and Enterprise... was that they all take place within that tried, true, and at this point... overused formula.  Infallible boy-scout crew faces technobabbly evil, ship and crew play novel roles to defeat enemy and save Earth/Federation.  There's a reason people weren't tuning into these things.

They were tired of that.  This is a people who were yearning for something more, something less cookie-cutter than Star Trek's idealistic and utopian future and one more story-driven and with *human* characters (like, with flaws), drama, and **functional** realistic space CGI.  Battlestar Galactica is a show that, I think, Star Trek would've done well to emulate.  Instead, we got the two movies that we have thus far gotten, stellar cast and stellar acting, an okay to mediocre script and storyline (Wrath of Khan II guize!!!), and hugely overdone CGI.  I was hoping for a more interesting plotline with good character development and relevant CGI.  My then-girlfriend and I talked about it for all of... the car ride back home... so two minutes.

Like, if I can't wonder about a film before and after it, if it doesn't get me pumped and jazzed as fuck about the up and coming ones... what the fuck was the point?  The 2009 Star Trek movie was better than Into Darkness, if you ask me, but even then... I left the theater in 2009 feeling wanting... like I had spent the last several years with a dearth of Star Trek only to get that?  Man...

I mean, I'll go and dutifully watch Star Trek III, but I've kind of given up hope that it's going to be something that tickles my fancy.  I guess I'm weird, though, I still love the Original Series a little bit more than TNG and Voyager.  I need to see DS9, though, I haven't yet and I'm told that'd be my shit.","1441066316"

Do Muslims consider viruses to be alive, and thus are prohibited from drawing them?

How about molds? Fungi? Protozoa?

I do not see how someone can predict whether a picture they draw will eventually be worshiped. In my mind mathematicians ""worship"" math. Good mathematicians basically think about math all the time to the exclusion of everything else, including worshiping God. Math takes up the attention of mathematicians to such an extent that many do not make time to think about worshiping God. So the prohibition against drawing ""creatures"" is a mistaken rule that does not have the effect that was intended, that is, preventing people from overfocusing on things other than God. The rule is not broad enough, the rule should rather be more general and expansive like, do not focus on _anything_ with lots of attention, except God. The rule against drawing creatures just allows people to overfocus on geometric shapes instead of creatures, both practices (focusing on creatures and shapes) can crowd-out thinking about God.","1441066316"

If you like the Great Scythe the Halberd/Scythe are both good options as well.  You might want to drop the +10 Divine for +15 on the GS if you intend to use it a lot.

Also, with your current level of int, Crystal Magic Weapon is a very viable option. With a +15 weapon you will do a lot of damage with your stats if you bring a weapon that will take advantage of both.

Would suggest also taking the Grass Crest to +14 at least, and if possible, making the Balder Shield +15, as it's one of the two best medium shields at +15.

As a silly afterthought, based on your int you might want to make a Crystal Ring Shield using the Butterfly soul and a +10 shield in Anor Londo.","1441066317"

You give me the coins, I take you across, and we both go about our business. You can be chatty or happy or psychotically upset, none of that matters to me because my job isn't to give a shit, it's to get you across in exchange for some coins. You'd think the flood of capitalists I'd gotten over the last few hundred years would get this. Really. They spend all their lives a rutheless capitalist and then expect to start getting shit for free just because they'd kicked the bucket?

Don't make me laugh. For a long time the only people who could pay were ones who'd died smuggling gold coins inside their body. It happens, and you can bet I didn't want to touch those coins, but *that* did make me laugh and those guys got across.

Finally though someone asked me a question around the early 2010's. A crass Englishman forced himself to the front of the crowd and rudely interrogated me on the state of things, just like most do. Once I explained the situation and stipulations he looked at me aghast for some time, and I really do feel like an idiot for not thinking of this before, but he asked me ""*Just what the devil I thought I was going to spend it all on.*"" I'd opened my mouth to reply and pointed at him, but no words or thoughts came. I scratched my head, and kicked my feet back and forth sheepishly for a bit. Come to think of it I couldn't even recall what had happened to all the coins I'd taken over the year. I put them in my pocket and they just seemed to vanish.

"CrimeMugshots","t5_38g60","Police received a call Friday night that two men with hooded sweatshirts and painted faces had tried to break into a man's home in Carroll, Iowa.
When police stopped a vehicle matching the caller's description blocks away, they were stunned by the men's disguises.
There were no ski masks or stockings pulled over their heads; instead, Matthew Allan McNelly, 23, and Joey Lee Miller, 20, streaked their faces with permanent black marker.
Carroll Police Chief Cayler told CNN the strange disguises made it easier for his officers.
""We're very skilled investigators and the black faces gave them right away,"" Cayler said jokingly. ""I have to assume the officers were kind of laughing at the time. I've never heard of coloring your face with a permanent marker.""
Cayler said police believe one of the alleged burglars targeted the home because he suspected his girlfriend had a relationship with the man who lived there.

""They probably were just not thinking straight and figured we'll go out and scare the guy or whatever,"" Cayler said. ""[They were] being dumb and combine that with alcohol and it was the perfect storm.""
Both men were charged with attempted burglary, and McNelly was charged additionally with operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Lawyers for the two men could not be reached for comment.
Cayler said he's been fielding calls about the case from news media outlets from all over the country -- mostly because of their funny-looking mug shots.
""I've been chief here almost 25 years, been with the department 28½ years and I've seen a lot of things that make me laugh and weird things but this was probably the best combination of the two -- strangely weird and hilariously funny all at the same time.""

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","If you're doing EE, you will almost certainly have a class called Embedded Microcontrollers, or Embedded systems, or similar. They will almost certainly use an ARM Cortex m3 board like the tiva or kinetis or STM.

That is indeed exactly the trade off with these boards. As someone else said, there's also a much lower standard for projects now - doing pretty much *anything* in first year outside class will be impressive, and the Arduino is a good place to start. You'll pick up the ARM stuff at some point - you could start now and see how it goes, but there's a reason the Arduino became popular. It really is that much easier to get up and running. So same question - do you want a head start on embedded systems, or do you want an easy micro to support learning in other areas? Both are valuable.","1441066322"

Regarding the second question, most of these standards are imposed by Blizzard, and they constrict Melee Mapmaking heavily, which can be good in certain aspects because it allows of a standardized experience, which can be good because it means no second guessing how much HP or minerals X thing has, but certain map features really **need** to be customized to allow for map balance on certain kind of nonstandard maps and layouts, and the lack of said customization affects game and map balance heavily.

Taking Brady's case was really a no lose situation for the NFLPA for this reason. We already have Kraft saying that it's time to change the process.

Brady has a lot riding on this decision, however, because of endorsements. He needs a favorable judgement to at least partly remediate his tattered national reputation.

Sex and gender aren't the same thing. 

First of all, some people with chromosomal differences look and believe they are a sex that does not agree with their chromosomes. Most people are only aware of two chromosomal possibilities: XX and XY. We think of XX as 'female' and XY as 'male.' However, approximately 1 in 1,667 births are neither XX NOR XY. One of the more common possibilities (still medically rare, but occurring in between 20,000 and 200,000 births each year) is Klinefelter Syndrome, where a person is born with XXY chromosomes.

Now that we've looked at chromosomes, let's talk about intersex and indeterminate genitalia. People can be born with genitals that are recognizable, to the non-medical eye, as ""male"" or ""female"" or as both (hermaphrodism) or as neither (various conditions). Some of these conditions are surgically altered at birth. Others are not. Some are more apparent, others are hidden.  http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency

I haven't even gotten to gender yet, but we've already identified people who have different chromosomes and different genitals.
  
So, gender. Gender is different than sex as sex is a combination of chromosomes and genitals, whereas gender is based on a societal expectation. People can be born with one ""sex"" or both, or neither, and can ALSO be of any number of places along a continuum of gender, regardless of what their bits look like.  

TL;DR We come in a bunch of different possible configurations. It's not as simple as XX/XY.

Just a heads up though, it does take a lot of dedication and you're not going to like the huge paycut while in med school. So, budget and save money while working as a nurse. 

Or you can go the FNP route. Faster and don't have to start all over again. ","1441066330"

"Atlanta","t5_2qiq9","&gt;So are shopping malls.

Maybe. Like I said, if the government wants to put polling booths in shopping malls all over, distributed roughly based on population, sounds great.

&gt;So are churches.

Maybe... I think they tend to swing pretty Republican though.

&gt;I don't see the need to restrict polling locations to government property only.

Not a big deal, really, but it naturally requires less effort, expense, and private-public coordination. And a lot of areas have no malls and but they probably have a school nearby. Maybe Wal-marts would be more equitable than shopping malls.

&gt;To my knowledge, neither Epworth nor S Dekalb Mall are on gov't property, and it worked out fine.

You seem to be fixating on something I really didn't intend to stress as the most important. Government facilities are less tricky to regulate. My anecdote: I voted at a church in Cobb once, and I had to walk through a gauntlet of political messages thinly veiled as religious artwork to get to the voting area. That's at least violating the spirit of the law.

&gt;The main problem with your one-size-fits all approach is that what works in one county may not make sense in another, especially if we're comparing rural counties to urban or suburban counties.

They all tend to have schools, especially elementary schools, spread throughout. 

&gt;If a county doesn't see a measurable increase in voters after implementing, for example, early voting or sunday voting, then they shouldn't be required to spend the resources to offer that. But if a county does see a measurable increase in voters, then those resources were well spent.

Ideally, but that just opens up so much gray area for manipulation. We already have a history of gerrymandering to rig votes based on districting, do we need to enable the same practices based on polling both locations? I just see constant corruption and fighting and back-room deals and last-minute changes to laws, all to subtely manipulate which polling location programs get to move forward.

&gt;Your general anxiety about demographics being manipulated

..has quite a lot of historical context.

&gt;and ""certain kinds"" of votes targeted (your scarequotes).

You're just being a jerk now. Really? I'm going to assume you know full well that I was referring to each side having their own preferred ""kinds"" of voters, and you took that way out of context in order to take a cheap shot.","1441066331"

In some cases, what was ""liberal"" several decades ago is ""conservative"" now as the times change.

In others, the person was just parroting the popular views of their cohort to fit in (liberal at the time), and still do so (now mostly conservative).

In both cases, it's just a matter of time. I'm sure that when I'm in my 70s, some of my current views will seem quite antiquated to my grandkids.","1441066331"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","I wouldn't be surprised if most people who strongly dislike the Mako are playing on consoles.  The control scheme is generally more familiar to PC users, who have been using WASD to turn/move and mouse to look independently since the nineties (e.g. Mech Warrior 2 could be configured this way, although I don't think it was the default).  Movement was fairly intuitive for me, but I found the jets (without hacks) to be a tad pointless.  The Mako was resilient enough that you rarely needed to use jets to cushion landings.  Using them when driving up a steep incline was almost always a bad idea.  With hacks the jets can be a lot of fun however.  A ""Harrier Mako"" with jump jets is actually kind of awesome.

Where the control scheme broke down a bit on the PC was the gun-sights.  Three discrete levels of zoom with no way to zoom out without going aaaaalll the way back to no-zoom was very annoying.  I wonder if there's some way to hack the game to create a zoom out key.  What would have been even better would have been continuous zoom, perhaps using the mouse-wheel.  This would have solved the ""Closer... Closer... #$%@ Too close!"" nature of the Mako's optics.  

Another reason why many people probably don't care for the Mako that much is that it generally wasn't much of a challenge.  It was exceedingly rare for enemies with small arms to get close enough to hit the Mako (not that they'd do much damage), and the big guns all fired very slow moving particles aimed (universally by all enemies) at your current location.  It was trivial to avoid all fire by simply staying far enough away to have time to react to incoming fire and then moving in between cannon shots.  A bigger variety of threats and AI strategies would have really made combat in the Mako more fun.  Thresher Maw's were the rare exception in that they had a random chance of coming up directly under you and flipping the Mako, which was bloody annoying.  A little warning if they were about to come up *directly* under you would have made them a little less cheap.  

Some of the main missions had very fun Mako sections however.  For example, Noveria was pretty fun if you abandoned the ""hang back and snipe everything with the cannon"" strategy and just bulldozed your way through Geth positions without worrying too much about picking off all the survivors.  Cannon sniping was, in general, too easy and, hence, boring.  Feros also had a pretty good Mako section.","1441066331"
