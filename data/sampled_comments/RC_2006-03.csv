"reddit.com","t5_6","If you look at a lot of these changes, they are really extracted refinements rather than bloating additions. They aim at making things more DRY and eliminating workarounds that used to be more clumsy. So while the Rails API may gain a few methods, it will actually make the programmer's experience using Rails more consistent and streamlined.

The beauty of a framework like rails is that you can use it without leveraging its full api - go ahead and write your stuff 'old skool' in 15 lines of code, and a few days later, you'll look over that code and you'll slash it down to a mere 3-4 lines using a rails method you've just discovered - it's a lot of fun.

DHH said somewhere that Rails 1.0 should have been 2.0, because he doesn't see a lot of major additions any time soon. He's wisely pushed 'higher level' functionality (like login systems, etc.) into generators, plugins, engines, whatnot, to keep the framework uncluttered. Rails is walking the line between high level convenience and low level flexibility better than any other framework I've ever used.",1141172269

You'd go to someone involved in international trade with an office in South Africa. You'd make an arrangement with them to pay them an amount of money which you would later withdraw in another country in which they had an offiec.

We've both proposed that Reddit should do a search for possible dupes, using some broader criteria than identical URLs, and display the (top X) search results to the would-be submitter before (s)he confirms the submission.

The new question you've raised is: how should Reddit display those search results? The Reddit search I mentioned does pretty well at finding the dup - it came in #5 - but even if the search had put the dup at #1 you probably still wouldn't have picked it up as such from its title. So maybe the search results should include some additional information about each hit displayed, not just its title and URL*. A short list of distinctive words from the hit might indeed be a good window into the content; the first few words from the body (in the manner of gmail/google web search) might be quite effective too.

And as for the shot, I watched the game, and that was the best shot but not by much. He (Nichols) was throwing brilliantly and there were a few other stunner shots.

The really cool thing about curling, though, is that your abilities don't degrade nearly as much with age as most other sports - lots of 80 year olds are very very solid curlers.

"reddit.com","t5_6","A few criticisms:

[1] It's misrepresentation to describe a *successful* scientist as doing a five year postdoc, a seven year jr. professorship and getting denied tenure.  At least in my field (cognitive psychology) the superstars can get prof positions straight out of the PhD, and most schools have reasonably high rates of granting tenure.  Good but not exceptional candidates can get tenured positions through persistance (it's not easy, but tenure is a substantial reward).  (An aside: you can be fired [with cause] prior to being granted tenure, but it's quite a perk to be guaranteed a *job for life* upon gaining tenure).  I'm sure this varies by discipline,region, and school, but Greenspun's ""average trajectory for a *successful* scientist"" is a strawman.

[2] Many scientists *do* love what they do and the lifestyle associated with academe.  My grad school advisor spent far more time drinking coffee on the quad watching the undergrad girls go by than any banker I know.

[3] This neglects the opportunity of scientists to leave the ivory tower and head to industry.  Many of my friends are now consultants, market researchers, data analysts, and user research leads.  These folks make very reasonable money (better than folks with BAs in the same discipline).  Advanced training in the sciences gives one skills that no undergrad major will offer (both technical skills and important experience in public speaking, writing, and leadership/mentorship).

There have been several posts about the silliness of going through grad school and the poor economic prospects of PhD grads.  There are risks involved, and there are *certainly* more lucrative ways to spend one's effort.  However, a discipline you love, a carefully chosen program and advisor, and hard work can certainly lead to a enjoyable and successful career in science.

A follow up article was written in Sep 2005, and can be found here:

These articles are excellent and thorough, providing references for further reading. If you have time for one, start with the newer (2005) article.

In short, 
1) Organic food may have significantly more antioxidants and other nutrients than ""commodity"" food which is bred to look good on the shelves.

2) satisfy your RDA's from food. The RDA's are crap, but you'de be surpised how hard this is if you're eating an appropriate low-calorie diet. Your genetics, age, level of activity, and sex may determine how much extra nutrients you need.

3) take a good multivitamin as an insurance policy. Writing how to do this is beyond the scope of what I can write here. Make it your responsability to do your homework. The LEF website is a good start. You may try some of Dr Colgan's and Dr Weil's literature. An excellent all-out framework on calories / nutrition can be found in the late Dr Walford's book ""Beyond the 120 year diet"". His daughter wrote an easier-to-read version. You don't have to follow the program to the extreme to learn a lot of practical stuff.

4) don't expect the government to look out for your interests in this area

Also:

If you live in Europe, your availability to vitamins may be severely restricted. Thank your government, the WTO, Codex Alimentarious Commission, and EU  for looking out for your best interests and restricting your freedom.


If you live in the US, fight for your freedom to keep taking vitamins, as forces attempt to erode this freedom continuously.

Many may think that Monsanto will save the day with some kind of engineered food that has all the goodies - call me old fashioned, but I'd rather just have the food that mother nature and humans have evolved to use over the millenia.

It's an honest question, I don't know the answer. What I've read is that there are many more PhDs graduating than there are positions at universities, or research positions at the relatively small number of big corporations that have dedicated long term research divisions. Government and big business seem to be the only groups with pockets deep enough to pay for new science. As for teachers, what I've observed is education is a popular field, and maybe it's a case of too many people thinking ""well, I'm not sure what I want to do, but I've been influenced by some really good teachers, and teaching is an important job where I think I could have a positive impact,"" or ""well now I've got an English degree, what are my options?"" and it's another case of too many people chasing too few jobs. Compare with medicine, which also seems to be a popular field, but where demand for more doctors and nurses is growing and will continue to grow as the population ages.

Certain words have a different frequency in the english language. For example, you can safely pull out every 'a', 'the' and 'of' from a document before comparing two. 

Instead of giving a score, like a spam filter, you get a result of keywords that together make the story unique.

Names, for example are a good unique item.

The dictionary system preassigns a uniqueness instead of learning like the bayesian filter. The results are similar.

* Who cares if the Clintons are in disagreement with each other? Why is that in any way important? The whole article reads as if his main point is ""ooh ooh ooh, the Clintons are not a monolithic entity, therefore George W. Bush is the bestest ever!"".

* Furthermore, they're *not* in fundamental disagreement with each other.  Senator Clinton's ""opposition"" basically boils down to ""Congress should review for 45 days, as is mandated by law, and the President acted injudiciuosly by attempting to get it through without Congess doing so.""  Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton's ""support"" basically boils down to telling Dubai Ports World that they should agree to the legally mandated 45 day review.

"reddit.com","t5_6","You raise an interesting point. I've heard from my wife that they get between two and three candidates interviewing for a position at her school. That doesn't seem like an overabundance to me, but of course my evidence is anecdotal. My wife says that plenty of her university classmates were in the position primarily because they didn't know what they wanted to do. That kind of thinking could lead to too many people and not enough jobs. However, there are plenty of unfilled teaching jobs in CA (where I live). So much so that many teachers are teaching on emergency credentials. Essentially they haven't completed their credential courses but the need is/was so dire that they were allowed to teach.

The other thing that's interesting is how many teachers are women. At my wife's school there is only one male teacher and he's about to retire. I often think that teaching is so low paying because it's thought of as a female profession. The men that do join the ranks of teachers seem to move up into administration more rapidly while their female counterparts tend to remain in jobs with proximity to students. My wife genuinely enjoys being with the kids she teaches and has no desire to move into administration. It may be that this acceptance of status quo, and the fact that teacher's pay isn't merit based, tends to keep salaries low.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Of course there are too many PhDs and teachers.  Supply and Demand.  That's why teachers get paid crap.  If teachers quit to do something else, pay would have to increase to keep enough to run a school.

Even if a school can't find anyone qualified, there are dozens of unqualified or partially qualified individuals to fill the positions.  Most highschools have at least a few teachers that aren't certified in the subjects they teach.

As far as grad school in math/science, I started in a bioinformatics program and quickly discovered that job opportunities weren't going to be many where I live (Arkansas).

When you only control for IQ and hours worked you can only attempt to explain why there are few people in general in the sciences, not why there are fewer women.  It doesn't address the question of why are men willing to take the pay cut and women aren't.  He of course tries to get around this obvious criticism by claiming that men are just myopic idiots who continue through what eventually becomes a 10 year investment just so that they don't have to admit to a career mistake.

Thank you.  It's refreshing to hear from someone that has a decent understanding of economics.

Paul Graham once said that bad managers combine two qualities that are common by themselves but rarely seen together: Someone that has 1) little knowledge about a subject but 2) strong opinions about it.

I would submit that this combination is much more common than he thinks - everyone has a strong opinion about economics, but very few have dedicated the time it takes to actually understand it.

I can tell you, that as a four-year economic major, this little pet-project makes NO SENSE AT ALL.  If oil dependency is such a bad thing, don't you think those who use oil and rely on that dependency would have the foresight to switch?  Forcing decisions upon consumers &amp; businesses is not the answer.  You're essentially arguing that they don't have the intelligence to make the decision for themselves.

I have news, that apparently is new, people are smart.  They will make decisions that are in their best interest, and in turn often in the economy's best interest as well.  

If you were in a car, driving 60 mph towards a brick wall, would you stop? Would you try to go around that wall?  Or would you drive right into it? 

The economy, my friend, reacts the same way.  We're not just going to wake up one day and run out of oil.  I submit to you that there will, in fact, be no ""major"" oil crisis at all.  The market will find the most economical alternative sources upon its own volition, as oil becomes less practical.

No need for governments to force inefficient decisions upon the market through regulation, grants, and other distorting practices.

Oh, and another comment regarding socialist governments.  It would do you will to understand their hidden costs.  Sure, giving to the needy today is great - just realize that when you do it, you're holding your country's future growth ransom.  If you don't understand why, take 4 years of economics.

dojo works around this by making everything you include go in a namespace. I wasn't happy with that workaround--it just clutters up the code too much.

As for problem 2, yeah, you can use something to wrap it up, or just create a local variable in the closure, but the point of the article was that you just shouldn't have to. It's a deficiency of the language that you have to do it at all.

What I'm really trying to do is a little more complicated: I'm trying to delete the hrefs from a series of links and add onclick handlers after a page loads so that it will have static navigation links in browsers without javascript and DHTML otherwise ([more details](http://foobar.infogami.com/blog/js_anchors)). All the links are neatly organized in a span, so I had no trouble getting the effect I want by rewriting the innerHTML of the span. I'm just annoyed that I can't do this in a more direct way.

"ru","t5_247i","1) По поводу оффтопика. 

Речь шла про комментарии к данному посту. Данный пост имеет тип 'self' - т.е. не ссылается ни на какой url, а предназначен исключительно для проведения обсуждения.

Темой обсуждения я выбрал следующую: ""как пропагандировать reddit среди широкой публики"" - ибо я считаю этот сервис полезным, и хочу, чтобы большо хороших людей про него узнали и им воспользовались.

Если кому-то не нравится такая тема, или он считает, что интереснее обсуждать другую - чтож, ""стрелочки"" и кнопка submit доступны всем.

С помощью стрелочек я и оценил комментарии к этому сообщению - исключительно по релевантности к данной дискуссии. Это моя позиция - я считаю сообщения qrilka *не релевантными* данному топику (не плохими, не скучными, не банальными, а именно не *релевантными*). Кроме того, мне хотелось (естественно), чтобы на верх попали топики, относящиеся к теме распространения reddit - чтобы легче было увидеть новые идеи и соответственно их обсуждать.

Свой выбор я также объяснил qrilka - хотя мог бы и промолчать.

Разумеется (и к счастью), я не единственный пользователь данного сервиса - у других пользователей другие мнения, предпочтения и интересы, и они также могут их выражать (стрелочками / новыми сабмитами). Just go ahead!

2) По поводу рейтинга.

Создатели рейтинга придумали рейтинг сообщений и новостей с тем, чтобы фильтровать интересное/неинтересное,  а рейтинг пользователей (карму) - с тем, чтобы стимулировать пользователей постить интересные новости, получая за это абстрактные положительные или отрицательные очки.

Мне кажется, что рейтинг новости или поста не стоит воспринимать лично - это оценка не человека, их запостившего , а лишь его действий, причём относительно случайной группой людей, на которую ты не имеешь никакого влияния. Поэтому, кроме разве что информации про то, насколько посты/комментарии интересны *этой* группе людей, другого содержания оценки и рейтинги не несут. Именно поэтому, ИМХО, не стоит на них сильно заморачиваться, и переносить эти оценки на собственную персону.

Кроме того, насколько я понимаю, оценки _комментариев_ на карму не влияют.

3) Карма это вообще интересная вещь - достаточно скоро в reddit появились так называемые ""karma whores"" (кармовые проститутки?) - люди, постившие новости не потому, что они интересные, а для того, чтобы повысить карму - а тренд прослеживался явно, достаточно было (на начальном этапе существования reddit) послать что-то из Пола Грема (Paul Graham), или про Lisp vs. Python, или про Javascript, или из joelonsoftware, dilbertblog.typepad.com или других успешных блогов. Так что высокая карма - то ещё не показатель качества ""работы"" постящего ;).

If you haven't noticed, Ruby is becoming popular fast simply because of RoR. While Ruby is a much better language than PHP, PHP itself (a pretty poor language) became very popular simply due to being great for making web apps. And at this point, it is the defacto standard for web apps, and thus it will continue to thrive on no matter how many problems it has.

What is Python the defacto standard for? When people think of web programming, they think of PHP or Ruby. When people think of systems programming, they think of C. When people thing of hardware intensive apps (such as games), they think of C++. Embedded languages? Lua is quickly taking over that market. And that's not a good place for Python to be. No matter how good of a language it is, if its just seen as an alternative to all of those languages for different types of apps, it will continue to lose momentum, to a point where using Python isn't as effective as it could be because all the programmers and libraries are in other languages.

Python is a great language. Unfortunately, it will become quickly overshadowed if it isn't marketed effectively. That's one things that RoR guys got right: how to market something. Ruby lacked it before RoR, and the massive increase in popularity shows this.",1141401236

The 'hot' list is the finest feature of reddit. Relative activity of a link is a fabulous measure of the value of a link. Did a link get the most interest during the past 10 minutes? Most click-throughs, most vote-ups? Then it's the hottest item! (Yes, I know the hot algorithm is more complicated than that). Even if the item falls off in interest quickly, it's still an excellent measure of relative quality, because it's essentially competing on a relatively even field... competing with the other new links only. The 'top' list is an uneven field... because they show up on the 'top' list, they get more people seeing them, and thus more votes, KEEPING them on the top list. But 'hot' only stays hot while it's on the 'new' and 'hot' lists. It gets a boost once it makes it to the 'hot' page, but it at least has an even chance with the other 'new' items to get to the 'hot' page.

So 'hot' is the best determiner for link quality, in my opinion, rather than absolute value. Absolute value is also a good determiner... but it's less INTERESTING. It's less fun, less unique. It's also harder to pick a cutoff value, because that cutoff will change over time... as reddit gets more popular, the same quality link will get a higher score as more people vote on it.

But the hot list is rather absolute... either you made it to the top #5 or not. More links won't change that much, nor will more users. So it's a more consistent metric, less dependant on the quantity of users voting.",1141407476

"reddit.com","t5_6","Finite State Automata (FSAs) are a way of modeling theoretical computer tasks, or modeling theoretical languages. They were invented before modern computers. Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Finite State Automata (DFAs and NFAs, in my coursework) have different rules, but both can be used to represent the same problem sets/languages.

They can solve certain regular expression matching problems.

Regular Expressions are a common programming tool.

Actual RegEx implementations in various programming languages are, to the best of my knowledge, based on these theoretical automata. Aside from NFAs and DFAs, there are Pushdown Automata (PDAs), Embedded Pushdown Automata (EPDAs), Deciders, Turing Machines, etc. all of which are useful for different discussions in computer science.

Automata theory is also a major part of formal linguistics. I guess computer science sortof grew out of formal linguistics. Maybe someone else here is more educated about that.",1141409863

"reddit.com","t5_6","This is an irritating article with a jumble of arguments that don't much pertain to the goal of ending the war on drugs.  Supposedly innocent bystanders and too many minorities going to jail are both side issues.  Both of these things happen with most types of crime.  They don't have a whole lot to do with what is wrong with the war on drugs.  Also, drug addicts and dealers are responsible for a majority of violent crime (especially if you include alcoholics).  This article tries to show that people who take drugs are mostly just hurting themselves.  This isn't true BECAUSE OF THE WAR ON DRUGS!

That is the real argument.  The war on drugs CAUSES almost all of the problems we relate to drugs.  Why do people steal and murder to get more drugs?  Because drugs are expensive ,addictive, and illegal.  Legalizing recreational drug use will stop 2 of those 3 problems with obtaining and using drugs.  The addictive nature of drugs can be managed like it is now; by rehab and education.  Just think of all the money we would have to  manage drug use in the US if we ended all spending on the war on drugs and taxed recreational drug sales.

Last argument:  Historically, prohibition has always started with ideas of creating a utopian society without social problems.  The argument for prohibition blams all that plagues us upon alcohol and drugs.  Can't society see the idiocy of this belief?  The historians among you need to look up some of the famous prohibitionists and their rhetoric to see how right I am.",1141410607

"reddit.com","t5_6","This is true for *older* teachers who have already made significant investments in their teaching skillsets.  It's not true for younger teachers that can still switch to another profession.

Among my cohort - people 1-2 years out of college - I've got a lot of friends that tried teaching for a year or two.  Most of them end up saying ""I like it, but there's no way in hell I'm doing this for $30-40k a year for the rest of my life"".  Then they go back to law school or get a job at a biotech firm or otherwise enter the decently-paid workforce.

This is a major reason why the public education system sucks.  The labor price is fixed by political decisions.  That leaves the quality of employees as the only variables.  Those who can get higher-paying jobs in industry leave, unable to justify the low pay and long hours even if they do like it (unless they're a masochistic saint, but those are rare).  That leaves only the employees that industry doesn't want to teach our kids.

The problem will likely get worse, because many of the retiring baby-boomer teachers entered the profession when there were glass ceilings that prevented otherwise-capable women from taking high-powered corporate jobs.  When my mom became a teacher in '68, it was almost unheard-of for a woman to be in senior management or a law partner or another high-paid position.  She became a teacher because that was what most smart, college-educated women did back then.  It was that or secretary (or in a few rare cases, journalist).  Now there's no glass ceiling, so my sister's going to be a petroleum geologist, my female friends are going to be doctors and lawyers, and a few are even looking at Wall Street careers.",1141411347

Take things like search, regexp search, replace, and regexp replace. Two and a half of those are under key shortcuts (I didn't know for years *that* and *which*), the rest you have to meta-x for. It's almost intuitive, but not quite - they sound very much alike but are slightly inconsistent: after replace-string and replace-regexp I expect replace-query, not query-replace, and I have to think a few moments about which one of these I wanted in the first place. I still have no idea how to do a replace in just a section of text. I assume it's possible *somehow*, but it's easier to switch to kdevelop at that point and go 'Edit', 'Replace' after making a selection.

"reddit.com","t5_6","As an embittered victim of exactly this process, I believe I have a little insight into this process. 

The goals that these kids have are many and varied, but many involve a graduate degree, and graduate school is vastly easier to get into if you attend the right undergraduate school. This is particularly true in CS, where graduate schools frequently *only* accept students from a handful of schools, with almost none coming from anywhere else (aside from international students). CS is an extreme case, but many top graduate schools, as well as law and medical schools also have this phenomenon to some degree. 

So these people are rightfully stressed out about getting in. It's not something wrong with them that causes this. Instead, I fault the admissions departments at the top universities they're trying to get into. Admissions departments provide applications chock full of lists of line-item activities, the clear implication being that you are at a disadvantage if you can't overflow the lists with your many and varied ""extracurricular activities."" And the people who get in bear this out: every classmate I know who got into an Ivy had a nauseating number of useless, meaningless extracurriculars that they didn't care about. 

They select for things like ""community service"" and sports and high school grades. By selecting for this, they cause the stressed-out overachievers to concentrate on meaningless activities. 

My solution would be to change the criteria. First, throw out every dedicated admissions officer. None of them know anything other than how to make bullshit meaningless criteria. Split admissions departments into admissions for each area of study (engineering, science, humanities, etc), and staff each department with professors from that area of study. Professors know their area, and so they will recognize when applicants do something remarkable in that area, where dedicated admissions officers, clueless about every particular field, will be blind to achievements in any kind of technical field. 

Then, change the criteria so that the most important thing is to have done something remarkable (an art project, a programming project, a history paper, an english paper, an engineering project) in the area being applied for. A report on or submission of that remarkable thing should be the central aspect of the application.",1141423463

"reddit.com","t5_6","That doesn't sound quite right. According to this:
http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/electric.html
the annual world consumption (2003) is 14767 billion kWhe.

A typical reactor is 700 MWe (6.13 billion kWhe), so that comes out to about 2400 reactors. Assuming a 50% utilization, that's only 4800 reactors total. Doubling the output to replace the energy used in transportation, we get 9600. Most plants have two or three reactors, for a grand total of 4000 plants. Not quite 12000. And that's replacing everything including coal and hydro.

To put that in perspective, that's one plant per 1.75 million people. Even if every plant costs US$50G for a 30yr life that's only US$1k per capita per year -- a small burden for energy.

A breeder burns up roughly 60 GWt * day / tonne U. Lets assume 33% efficiency and call that 20 GWe * day / tonne. That's 20 * 24 = 480 GWe * hr / tonne U, or 0.48 billion kWhe / tonne U. So 2 tonne U per billion kWhe. 

So, 14767 billion kWh e * 2 is about 30,000 tonne U per year. There is about 10,000,000 tonne reserve or 300 years' worth.

Wrong. A parent's authority over a child is predicated on the assumption that the parent has more knowledge, wisdom, and maturity than the child. Of course, that's not always true, but it's true often enough.

Such is not the case between government officials and private citizens. The people who work in government are, by and large, the same as the people that don't. They generally represent the same cross-section of society (with probably more of a leaning towards wealth and privilege on the government side -- at least at the highest levels).

but there is no 'P' in Django, none in Turbogears either and though there is a P in Zope and Plone, its not for Python and I would have loved to see BitTorrent have a P in there somewhere.

That's what PHP and now Rails are getting right. They are marketing to the little man, not the Linux programmers and the ""I know 20 languages"" guys. With Rails and PHP, people who have never done web development before are learning them. That brings fresh blood into the area, and it becomes the ""everyman's"" language. And yeah, while Rails is getting quite a few big name adopters from the Java world and such, that's not the majority of people and as a result, its a situation where a bunch of less experienced programmers are able to say, ""See, even x uses Rails."" With Python it seems like its more of a situation of really smart peers sitting around and saying ""Isn't this great what I've done with Python - I wrote Portage for Gentoo. What have you been doing? Oh, you wrote an entire database system? Amazing."" You just don't hear about everyday (newbie) programmers picking up Python unlike PHP and such (obviously it does happen, that's just not where the focus of the Python community is at).

Just look at MySQL vs Postgres. Most informed people would agree that Postgres is better, but MySQL is infinitely more popular due to who they marketed to (ie, the little man).

And like some of the people responding to Guido's original post were saying, that's why marketing Python has never worked, because the types of people who use Python don't really understand how to market things efficiently. Hell, look at the Python webpage. A few months ago when I was personally deciding whether to use Ruby or Python, that's what turned me off.

Thank God I got smart and am now actually learning Python. But hey, even something as small as the name can have a big impact. How many people want to use a programming langauge that brings forward images of a big snake? How about a programming language with four letters in its name that brings forward ideas of riches? There's a big difference there, albeit an underlying physcological one.

I understand why Python was named what it was, but people picking a language these days don't, and I think the name is an example of the mindset behind Python: its just never known how to market itself.

One of the deciding factors that had me wanting to use Python was the underlying knowledge that Google uses Python heavily (I suspect many of your PHP scripter type people have no idea about this), and I saw a book with a few small apps written in it. It had an aura about it. Now honestly, having started to learn Python, that aura no longer exists as much, but Python NEEDS that aura, which makes people think that Python is used by interesting people to do interesting things.",1141497489

"reddit.com","t5_6","No, this is not the solution. CS grad schools are the ultimate paradise for hackers. You get paid to do nothing but hack on cool new stuff, and write up the results of hacking, and also teach up-and-coming proto-hackers. Also, you're surrounded by other amazing hackers, in the form of other grad students and professors. See http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/%7Eharchol/gradschooltalk.pdf for more on why this is true. 

Incidentally, I can't completely blame the CS grad schools that are worst this way for having this policy. PG's essay on undergraduation is one reason why: the professors reading the applications know the professors recommending the students. Another reason why is that the top undergrads at the top several CS schools get transformed into experienced researchers by the time they graduate (because there's so much available research at the top schools), while top undergrads at lesser schools can't do this, and so the grad school admissions people can't tell whether the latter applicants will actually be good at research. 

Instead, the solution is just to go through the system. Get into the right undergrad. You will be much happier, because the top four grad schools are highly concentrated with smart people (Some of the top four are worse than others for this kind of thing. I know many grad students at UC Berkeley who didn't come from the right undergrad, but no grad students at CMU who didn't. So if you don't get into the right undergrad you aren't completely screwed; you just have to crank up how amazing you are a couple times.).",1141508244

Christians are just a special case of religious people, and no one that I am aware of thinks they are sub-human.

I do find it interesting that the religious seem so consistently to think that they are under attack.  Were there a push for hydrodynamics to be taught in sunday school, christians would go batshit, and with good reason-people would be trying to steal time from religious study and devote it to something else.  There are, as far as I know, no serious efforts to institute anything like this.

Negative moderation can be used by people with ill-will, or to manipulate opinions. Just think of the recent Wikipedia event where politicians altered content.

I'll add that Lincoln's adherence to orthodox Christianity has been much disputed, then, and since:



Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ""Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh."" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ""the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.""

  With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

No, it's not valid code. You don't have to read the C++ standard, but at least ask someone before you complain that templates should be able to see the future.

Do people really care how Stallman, Steele and Zawinski compare to Peyton-Jones and Wadler? These famous figures would probably be faintly embarrassed as this competition and think the competitors are missing the point, by treating them as sports teams.

But that said, here's my knowledge of these figures:

* McCarthy apparently has much more on his plate than Lisp. After all, there is more to computing than some tool. You might be the sort of astronomer who specializes in the engineering of telescopes, to make better tools for others to use, but I imagine not all astronomers are measured as to their telescope-making skills. (Or are they?) Science is a collaborative endeavor, and this is particularly evident with Lisp. The Lisp world is quite decentralized, and I think one measure of its merit is how democratically free one is of some central language designer.

* Wadler (whose name was invoked a couple levels up in this subthread) has done work modelling XML, despite knowing that Lisp's sexps [often better meet](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/xml-essence/xml-essence.pdf) XML's technical goals. Clearly, Haskell has some advantages that a Lisper might need libs such as Series (some lazy eval) or [Qi](http://www.lambdassociates.org/) (powerful type system, claims to be more so than Haskell in a technical sense) to approximate. However, I don't think Wadler's calculus is as simple as only researching what's 100% technically best.

However, I think all this misses the point. There is an enormous cost to anti-polyglot advocacy, where ""professional"" programmers are reduced to ""my language designer is bigger than yours."" I paid it when starting out with Lisp; the Lisp community is under strong pressures to obscure the current problems of their tool, just as any other language community. So for instance:

* I started out with SICP Scheme. Oops. After thinking it was interesting, I realized that Python was more multiparadigm, which was what I was looking for anyway, so went back to Python. (No doubt, many prefer Scheme; obviously what's right for me is wrong for certain others.)

* Through pure luck and foolishness, I decided to invest time with Common Lisp. That reaped serious benefits. However, even then my rate of learning was much slower than it could have been, because Lispers were tight-lipped about serious critiques. That is unacceptable from a technical community; nevertheless, that's also the status quo in computing, where people metaphorically pick some martial-arts school and stick with it.

While I'm against anti-polyglot advocacy, I do understand why the pressures are there. At a Lisp meeting (and I have permission to relay this story now), I met someone who hid his use of Common Lisp while he wrote his dissertation, as certain features made the dissertation pretty trivial compared to the Java version he'd been working on. That's just the tip of the iceberg; people feel they must sneak around like children to use tools they want. It seems every Lisp meeting brings up someone's professional secret.

And so while I might've liked to learn Haskell and OCaml much earlier, I don't have the time to deal with the uncritical foolery behind learning new platforms. I see it from the Haskell community, just as I did the Lisp community, the Python community, Java, etc. These pointless honor-competitions simply serve to turn people off.",1141590535

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; So you don't think most government officials are more qualified for their positions than the average citizen.

I didn't say that. This isn't about whether they're qualified for their positions, it's about what the authorities and responsibilities of those positions are.

&gt; Also, what do you make of the fact that even in the U.S.A., there are an unusual amount of political ""families"" which produce public servants: The Adams family, the Harrison family, the Taft family, the Bush family, the Kennedy family, among others.

&gt; So much for the cross-section of society.

Actually, you're right about this. Which even further emphasizes my point: those in government are generally not there because they are wiser, more responsible, or more mature than the average citizen.

Generally speaking, the reasons people make it into public office are:

 * They have a particular level of expertise with certain aspects of managing government and/or infrastructure,

 * They have very good connections and significant wealth, or

 * They have an unusual level of charm and charisma, allowing them to convince people that they meet the first requirement.

Needless to say, these reasons are not mutually exclusive -- I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to decide what the average mixture is.

"reddit.com","t5_6","There are a pair of fairly simple changes to the SAT that could eliminate the need for all the extra-curriculars: change the scoring algorithm, and make the content harder.  Presently, about half of the scoring range of the SAT is used to distinguish various shades of bad.  It is possible to get several wrong and still get a 1600.  This is generally true in most of the ETS tests.  If, instead, only answering every question correctly got a 1600, and every question answered incorrectly dropped your score by a significant amount(this is not the case now), there would be many fewer 1600s, and many more 400s.  This would increase the usefulness of the test to the most competitive institutions.
If the content of the test were made harder, a similar effect would occur, and this would allow colleges to be as selective as they want without requiring extracurriculars.

I don't think this is the right way to go, incidentally.  SATs are a pretty good measure of IQ and therefore a moderately good tool to separate people into broad, overlapping categories( people with an IQ around 90 are not likely to be good knowledge workers, people with an IQ around 130 are, people around 110 might or might not be.), but they do not do a very good job of discriminating on other important attributes like motivation, persistance and imagination.

Ideally, there would be three ways to get in to college- doing a small number of big things, doing a large number of small things, or showing evidence of a lot of talent, without any actual achievements yet.  Making the finals at Westinghouse, getting published, starting a business, becoming an Eagle scout, etc., would be examples of big things, while getting good grades would seem to be the canonical example of doing a lot of little things, and the results of an IQ test are the best proxy we have to the third.

Of course, colleges do this now, only not explicitly.  I think in this case being explicit would have substantial advantages.",1141596695

"reddit.com","t5_6","I sent this email to the author of the article:

You make an excellent observation-google's current method of observing the content of the net absolutely does have a large effect on the behavior of website owners.   The coworker who showed me your article noted that this is a sociological application of something like the Heisenburg uncertainty principle, which says that it is impossible to simultaneously know the momentum and position of a particle, and that by attempting to observe one, the observer changes the other.  You (and he) seem to think that this is a structural problem, but I believe it is not. 

Were the cameraman in your post-game example invisible, or indistinguishable from the crowd, he would have no effect on the crowd.  Even if he were distinguishable as a cameraman, if he turned the camera away from boorish people, then boorish behavior would not be as favored by the filmed mass.

Google presently uses a fairly crude instrument to observe a website-it looks at links, and at the textual content of the site, and finally it probably does some back-end number-crunching to make sure that someone does not just rip long chunks of text from other sites.  It does not attempt to get input from human users, which would catch most such sites very quickly.   Reddit, Digg, del.icio.us, and several other such sites (in the interest of disclosure, I am writing one in my off time) each make some attempt at allowing individuals to vote on webpages, rating their content.  They do not presently have the scale that google does, but if implemented and scaled properly, I believe they could be far more resistant to boorishly designed webpages than google is at present, and that the aggregate behavior of the web would be accordingly far more restrained.   With the proper observational instrument, 'winning' the race for pagerank becomes identical with creating webpages that are useful to people, and then a very large number of very tacky people will have to find something else to do with their time.*


* this depends on the somewhat suspect assumption that there are not enough tacky website readers to support all of the current crop of junk website publishers.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I believe the experience of reddit clannishness is caused by 2 design flaws in reddit: 

1- no tags

2- global ranking

No tags means that there is only like/don't like/don't care in the list of voting options, and also requires things like programming.reddit.com.  If we could tag things, then it would be extremely easy to, say, avoid Guy Kawasaki articles, or politics, or whatever.  It would also take some of the pressure off titles-if you see that an article is titled ""the worst idea ever"", and is tagged politics, you know a lot more than merely the title.  

The second flaw is arguably worse.  The currency of reddit is pretty much global ranking, whether it is of articles or of your account.  While there must be a ""how-fit-this-article-is-for-you"" number to make the recommended page (reluctantly assuming the links are not random), users don't see it.  This means that intra-reddit community formation is very hard, and goes against human intuition on how groups work.  

If I submit, say, a haskell paper, it will probably get a middling score at best-it will be rated down by whatever spammer is pushing an article at the moment, a few of my less tolerant lisp bretheren, and who knows who else.  While the middling score is an accurate representation of the reception of the link by the community as a whole, if every one of the people who are interested in haskell thought it was great, then I would call the submission a towering success.  By the same token, I am only slightly interested in the fact that some random redditor voted a site up, but there are people whose up-vote would mean I absolutely want to read the article, and am rather likely to vote it up.  If reddit had this, then you would tend to experience less clannishness, I think.",1141617391

The teaching aspect of homeschooling tends to be very overrated.  No one can teach anyone ""everything they need to know.""  As a parent I hope to be a guide, a mentor, and a teacher when required, but those times will come at my kids' pace and at their request.  Homeschooling is all about providing the opportunities and attention that the factory approach to education *can't* provide.  Discipline and faith (if it's important to you) are separate from academics, but should be similarly presented, rather than coerced and beaten into kids.  If our societies can just keep from killing our kids' minds through factory-model education, they can take themselves a hell of a long ways.

"reddit.com","t5_6","About money: I agree. I'd put it like, I think that it's appreciation that's important. Usually the easiest way to acknowledge appreciation towards someone (in work life) is to pay accordingly, in hard cash. There are other ways too, like in the open source world where your talents are appreciated by showing interest and respect instead of money. But money is the least unambiguous.

I don't mean to imply that you'd do what you love partly because you need others' appreciation. You just have to get feedback that you're as good as you think you are. Appreciation in this sense is about knowing you're on the right track, it's about succeeding globally. It's converting your being-good-at into something that's concrete. If you have a business, you know your works and skills must be appreciated by looking at the incoming cashflow. Anything you know will directly translate into cash. If you're employed, looking at your salary will tell you how much your employer appreciates your work. If you write FLOSS software for yourself, you get to appreciate yourself as soon as the software really works and you get the job done. More of the same if there's a while community thinking you're a really smart programmer, embracing and using your software.

On the other hand, if you do what you don't love, a lot of money will motivate you only temporarily and you're probably not going to be a success anyway. Conversely, if you're paid too little but have lots of fun hacking on something you love to do, you can shine for a while just because you love it, but the lack of appreciation (=money) will eventually bite you off. You can also be paid too much, in which case you also know your employer doesn't know what you do. You only need to get paid enough (with respect to the level of appreciation you deserve). Beyond that level it's the non-material things that matter the most.

Most hackers agree that they don't do what they do for money though it's important to get enough money to keep things fair. :-)

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Writing these programs left me progressively less satisfied with Perl. Larger project size seemed to magnify some of Perl's annoyances into serious, continuing problems. The syntax that had seemed merely eccentric at a hundred lines began to seem like a nigh-impenetrable hedge of thorns at a thousand. ``More than one way to do it'' lent flavor and expressiveness at a small scale, but made it significantly harder to maintain consistent style across a wider code base. And many of the features that were later patched into Perl to address the complexity-control needs of bigger programs (objects, lexical scoping, ``use strict'', etc.) had a fragile, jerry-rigged feel about them.

&gt; These problems combined to make large volumes of Perl code seem unreasonably difficult to read and grasp as a whole after only a few days' absence. Also, I found I was spending more and more time wrestling with artifacts of the language rather than my application problems. And, most damning of all, the resulting code was ugly--this matters. Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones, because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code.

&gt; With a baseline of two dozen languages under my belt, I could detect all the telltale signs of a language design that had been pushed to the edge of its functional envelope. By mid-1997, I was thinking ``there has to be a better way'' and began casting about for a more elegant scripting language.

&gt;The children I teach are ahistorical, they have no sense of how past has predestined their own present, limiting their choices, shaping their values and lives.

Is this surprising?  When you watch history unfold, you realise what happens with cause and effect.  If you've watched less history unfold, then you're going to be less aware of this.

&gt;The children I teach are indifferent to the adult world. This defies the experience of thousands of years. A close study of what big people were up to was always the most exciting occupation of youth, but nobody wants to grow up these days and who can blame them?

Some referential evidence of this would not go amis.

&gt;The children I teach have a poor sense of the future, of how tomorrow is inextricably linked to today. As I said before, they have a continuous present, the exact moment they are at is the boundary of their consciousness.

Anyone that has spent time with a toddler will know that they really do have no conception of causality.  Is it such a huge leap to believe that you gradually gain a better understanding of these things as you get older?

&gt;The children I teach are materialistic, following the lead of schoolteachers who materialistically ""grade"" everything - and television mentors who offer everything in the world for free.

Firstly, 'grading' is not about materialism, it is about competition.  Secondly, if everything in the world were free, why would this make people materialistic?

This is nothing more than another attempt by AOL to profit from their IM service. They are not releasing *source code*, *protocol documentation* or anything useful. Instead they are releasing a set of binary libraries:

&gt; It is a set of libraries that provides access to AIM functionality.

It will cost money to use these libraries and your app will suddenly stop working as soon as it gets popular:

&gt; Developers of IM products using Open AIM will have the right to sell them, as well as sell advertising placement. But if a consumer application generates more than 250,000 logins a day, or 2 million logins a month, the developer will have to enter into a licensing agreement with AOL.

I am amazed as it appears that AOL employees may have even flooded /. with praise of this worthless money-making joke!

All I really want is for third party clients like centericq to have better support for the AIM protocol. In particular, centericq needs:

 * Ability to retrieve away messages without having to send the remote user a message.

 * Differentiate between ""online"" and ""mobile"" status'.

 * File transfer, seriously. Few people I've met are willing to drag out some other app just to send me some photos, thats the reality of it.

 * More specific error messages.

 * Builtin protection against ""too many messages per interval"" errors.

 * Make the scripted sending of messages fail less often.

So, correct me if I'm wrong, but this library is useless to us linux users. IM has grown to be a primary mode of communication for many of us and don't even tell me that I should make everyone I know switch to jabber..

And the more languages you know, the more likely you will have the right tool for any given job.

&gt;i really wonder why people obsess over syntactic sugar and core language features when library and system support are far more important for getting work done.

I personally think that core language features are very important, otherwise we'd all be programming in assembly, but even assuming they're not: if there's a really amazing library in ruby for doing something you want to do, and perl doesn't have it, what do you do?

Finally, learning new languages is really interesting. It expands your understanding of programming, makes you a better programmer in the languages you already know, and puts you in a better position to judge new languages as they emerge. Also, it's just plain fun.",1141671782

I had the same experience which the author mentioned: After six years of Perl programming (where Perl was the language I used for programming 80% of the time) I picked up Ruby in about 3 days.  After a week I felt more comfortable with Ruby than I ever was with Perl.  Now when I look at Perl code it's just painful - and I was a big Perl fan in the past.

""where you can literally crank out code on the fly with no references, no programming manuals, etc.""

I think that's the main point: In Perl I always had to refer back to the manuals (granted, they were good manuals) because there were lots of things that weren't consistent or easy to guess.  With Ruby my first guess about how something in the library works is correct at least 80% of the time... it's an incredible boost to productivity.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I was using this as a specific example of the general principle that having a teacher is helpful in many subjects.  I am not aware of a high school, or for that matter any school, using principia, but regardless of what book you choose to learn from (and the selection of good texts targeted at high school students is extremely thin, in my experience), it is helpful to have a teacher/tutor.  This is not merely because the teacher 'waters things down', but because a good teacher can see what mistakes you are making, and a very good teacher will know how the sort of mistake you made correlates to what pedagogy is most effective for you.  In addition, many students will develop bad approximations that yield correct results in a specific domain, eg sin(x)= x in radians, and think that is the correct answer in general.  Teachers can catch that a bit better than a book can, because they have runtime information.

As an example of a case in which a teacher seems to be necessary, I used to do a workshop in which I would help  a smart high school student derive trigonometry from the counting numbers and the successor operation.  It may be possible, but is certainly very hard, to get a student to do that on their own.

Apparently to you, being disrespectul means disagreeing with you.

&gt; If you hit another adult, it is unequivocally illegal. If you do so whilst in a position of power over that other adult, it is torture, and against international (though apparently not American) law. What is different about someone who has not yet reached majority that makes such behaviour acceptable in that case? In the adult world, the question of degree never arises - it's the fact of being in a position of power that elevates the offence, not the severity. Yet you argue for a division between physical chastisement and abuse based on degree, with no regard for the very powerful position of parents over their children?

Yes, I do, because you are using an extremist position instead of just using common sense. Light physical discipline never hurt anyone. Infact, it likely helped many people because it led them to do the right things. Just because certain people take it over the top doesn't mean that physical discipline in itself is wrong. Yes, the parents have a powerful position over children - that is the nature of things. Parents exist to raise their children up, providing for them and teaching them. A very effective way of teaching them what is wrong is to show that there are consequences for doing what is wrong. Often, getting a good spanking leaves a lot more of an impact (I don't want to do that again!) than simply just scolding a child.",1141698951

"reddit.com","t5_6","Here's a nugget of truth: parents who have lived for 20+, 30+, or 40+ years generally know more than the children that they are raising.

If I'm a little kid, my parents aren't going to let me walk up to a fire and stick my hand in it. They are going to teach me that doing so is a bad thing and can really hurt me. The same goes with anything else. If I'm doing something that can hurt me or others, my parents can teach me that those things are bad - and an effective way of conveying that sometimes (its not appropriate for every situation) is light physical discipline.

So you can take two approaches here: you can let your child do things that might hurt them or others, and the child may or may not learn from them, or you can teach them from the beginning that those things aren't good.

I'm not advocating this teaching style - I hardly even glanced over the article.

Its probably a good idea, as drug/alcohol/tobacco use can end up really messing a baby up. I'm sure there are medical limits as to what will and won't affect an infant in the womb, and that's probably where the legal restrictions should be set.

That's a good question. As far as I know, there's never been restrictions on stuff like that before. I know when my mother had my younger brother, her doctor made her stay in bed for like the last 9 weeks of her pregnancy. That really comes down to a judgement call. I'm not sure that women should be legally restricted from engaging in physical activities while pregnant (maybe certain ones), but not all women are the same and different physical actions will affect their pregnancies differently.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I was interpreting the word 'materialism' in the straightforward way as referring to the desire for material, i.e. physical, goods.  To me (maybe just me?), materialism conjurs images of sports cars, plasma tv's and the like.  Competition makes me think of olympic athletes, entrepreneurs and so on.  I accept materialism is a subset of competition, but not vice versa.

IMO, calling grading materialism is dishonest, in a similar way to calling copyright-infringement theft.

Regarding your meat analogy, no, I would not call the grading of meat as materialism.  The aspiration to eat the best cuts of meat could be classed as such, but not the actual grading itself.  Having said that, it is certainly closer to materialism than grading exam scripts since it does, at least, have something to do with material goods.

Regarding the Porsche analogy, I would say that the statement ""A 4.0 GPA ..."" would be more accurate if the word ""materialistic"" was removed entirely - the word ""value"" suffices.",1141735440

Some people can see through algebraic derivations very quickly, some need every line presented and others can do it as long as the 'trick' is hinted at.  Some people are very quick to map the problem into geometry and use symmetry arguments, others just can't see it, even when the diagrams are drawn.  Some people are very happy generalising the problem using abstract algebra, others aren't.  The problem is that these skills are not strongly correlated to each other; the student who is strong at algebra may be weak at geometry and ok at abstract algebra.  Since any maths topic may well require all of these skills, it starts to become very difficult to create a one-size-fits-all solution.",1141736155

"reddit.com","t5_6","What he's done seems to be a first approximation to [constraint programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming). A naive Prolog program would run through an exponential search tree in this case; backtracking when some constraints are broken (even if you don't know the rest of the variables) will prune the search tree quite a lot. Of course, there's a lot more to constraint programming than that, a part of which is rearranging the order of evaluating properties which, as he mentions at the end, brings the evaluation time down tenfold. All this seems pretty ad hoc the way I'm talking about it, but constraint programming is actually a proper field of study with a systematic formal basis.

Seems almost like [Greenspun's Tenth Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun's_Tenth_Rule) in reverse: a Common Lisp program that contains an ad hoc, informally-specified implementation of half of constraint programming. Who'd have thunk it?",1141737274

"reddit.com","t5_6","There are ways to further prettify that code, such as aligning columns with whitespace, or adding dummy symbols.

But let's take the first code fragment, the *prepare* statement. The only ""code"" there is the very first line. For the next lines, it's as if someone spliced in XML... but a less verbose and [very useful variant](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/xml-essence/xml-essence.pdf) of XML. So, in evaluating that code, one possible benchmark is how it would've looked like in a general programming language plus a data language.

Certainly, anyone might object to the next stuff in UPPER CASE, but that's not actually code he wrote -- but rather automatically generated by Lisp, printed in uppercase. He's just illustrating this intermediate code, just like someone decompiling a target language to poke at its internals. Like a surgeon pointing out a cadaver's guts to his peers while demonstrating a technique.

That means that all his code is simple calls to *prepare*, while the messy stuff is autogenerated by Lisp. That is a common pattern -- macros contain messy plumbing code, in order for you to write clean data-driven syntax on top.

Now, we can click the link to his sourcecode, which backs it all up. It's about 100 lines. It uses a templating language which translates the simple data-driven syntax that Edi invented, into Lisp code which the Lisp system understands. One way to ""read"" it is to use built-in Lisp tools, such as *macroexpand*. Which in fact Edi did earlier, when he showed the uppercase code.

Is the sourcecode a reinvention of constraint programming? Should it be done in Prolog? Well, certainly Lisp is used to assimilate other styles. Perhaps stylized OOP was invented by the Smalltalk tradition, but Lisp stole it and made interesting improvements. (To the extent that Alan Kay claims that a Lisp OOP book, *Art of the Metaobject Protocol*, was ""the best book written in computing in ten years."") And Edi Weitz, author of this article, apparently ""stole"" Perl's regexes, often [outperforming Perl](http://www.weitz.de/cl-ppcre/#performance) to boot.

(Not to mention that Lisp has its own [constraint libraries](http://www.cliki.net/Screamer). And as far as I can tell, [a lot](http://www.jfsowa.com/krbook/) of important logic and knowledge representation work has been done with Lisp. Keeping in mind I'm not an expert.)

If we look through Norvig's *Paradigms of AI Programming*, we'll see a bunch of Prolog-in-Lisp code. Intended to be embedded in a Lisp system after writing a bunch of macros, but he also listed (apparently serious) implementations of Prolog using Lisp syntax. Would some of the modern non-lisp Prologs be much faster at processing terabytes of data, if you need something done in 10 minutes? Perhaps; and given such constraints, that may be one factor causing you to choose a non-lisp Prolog.",1141752062

"programming","t5_2fwo","Tcl rocks. Tcl to scripting languages is what C is to compiled languages, simple small footprint, least hairy implementation. I am not sure, but I've got a hunch that it is the most efficiently parsed scripting languages. 
Here are the top few points I like about Tcl. 
 1. Lack of comma in list syntax (ideal for sublanguages based on list expressions, similar to lisp)
 2. It's simplicity, it seems very easy to implement. If some government bans all open source software, I have a feeling that I can write up my own tcl interpreter reasonably quickly.
 3. The ""eval"" thingy is very powerful yet simple, powerful enough to do anything we do with lisp-macros, simple enough for a mechanical engineer like myself to understand its implementation.  
 4. There are plenty of ibraries, extensions and wrapper generators, making it easier to get common things done quickly.

Christianity, by accident or by design (or both), has created the perfect formula for religion and control of the masses.  They have the sole vehicle to God, a nasty little hell as punishment for those who don't believe, and the 'last minute save' if you so choose to cave in to the fear and accept Christ.  Not to mention a book that supposedly lays out all the rules.  I like to believe that mankind in this age is (re)awakening to the realization that God/Self/Nature/Etc lives within us all and salvation is only as far away as accepting that fact.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Of course I was forgetting about Smalltalk, so thanks for reminding me...  Smalltalk does indeed have a better implementation for method finding, etc. than tags files.

IANASP (I am not a Smalltalk programmer), but as far as I can tell, it's still not up to what the Java IDEs can do, though it's probably close enough an awful lot of the time.  I really wish that Emacs could jump around Ruby code as well as the Smalltalk browser does.

To illustrate a case where the browser falls down though, you could try finding the definition of a commonly-overridden method like ""new"" for a given class.  If you try to browse to the definition of a generically-named method like that, you can get tens if not hundreds of potential answers returned, with no indication of which is the right one.  

If it's not defined on the class itself, then you'll have to resort to guessing at which one of the class's superclasses it might be in, or you have to manually navigate the class hierarchy looking for it.  In the case of 'new' you might guess that it's defined in the Class class, and look there but it's not (It's actually in Behaviour, in Squeak at least).  

With static type information the IDE would jump straight to the correct definition (try it with toString() in IntelliJ or whatever), though at least the Browser does it a whole lot better than simply grepping through the entire codebase for occurrences of whatever you're looking for.

This sort of thing is all very well when you're a seasoned expert.  You probably know almost instinctively where things are defined and can jump to the right place as quickly as an IDE can, but where the ""accurate"" part is a huge advantage for those Java IDEs is for people maintaining unfamiliar code (I suspect this is a lot of people).  The easier it is to find the code you're looking for, the faster you'll be able to do your job.",1141759016

I have read Matt and John in the original Koine, and parts of Luke and Mark, and the translations are mostly just as useful.

Most of the passages that are contradictory cannot be explained away by questions of translations.  For instance:

Matthew 1:1-17 Luke 3:23-38 are two totally inconsistent accounts of Jesus' genaeology (and also go through the line of Joseph who according to the faithful is not Jesus' father)

Mark 15:22 ""And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."" 
John 19:14-15 ""And about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! But they cried out...crucify him!""

John 19:30 ""When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.""

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; The children I teach are materialistic, following the lead of schoolteachers who materialistically ""grade"" everything - and television mentors who offer everything in the world for free.

""Materialistically"" describes the way teachers go about grading, not grading in general.  Why, as a student, do I have to rely on someone else to tell me whether anything I do is ""good""?  The way schools constantly judge everything and try to assign absolute values accurately reflects the business world but does not accurately reflect life.

Materialism is one of the roots of schooling right now, so it's hard to say it doesn't include competition rather than the other way around.  Simple example: why do I go to school? To learn.  Why do I need to learn? To get a better job.  Why do I need a better job? To get more stuff. 

It's very possible that a larger group of people than I am aware of don't care about better jobs and more stuff, but schools still broadcast that philosophy loud and clear.  ""If you don't get good grades you won't get into a good college, if you don't get into a good college, you won't get a good job.""  I'm not going to die if I get F's.  I'm not going to die if I work as a janitor in a factory somewhere.  BUT, I'm told all the way along that if these things happen I'm a failure and am doomed to unhappiness.  In this way, materialism is stirred up in children as a motivator and it's just not healthy.  

Some of the most fulfilling lives I've read about were lived by the poorest (materially) of the poor who simply did what they loved.

&lt;B&gt;About Discipline&lt;B&gt;
from http://christinaspringer.blogspot.com

I personally use structure, routine, parental bonding, attentiveness, awareness of my child's intellectual capability (based upon documented physiological research), information, honesty and praise. 

&lt;B&gt;Honesty &lt;B&gt;
Say what you mean.  Always.  

If you say - ""I'm going to cut Wilson bear into forty pieces if you don't stop.""  You have to do it. 

Waiting for teddy bear shredding time is too late.  The smallest transgression  is enough. It only takes once - 

""we're going if you don't share.""  

S/he doesn't share.  Go.  

It takes maybe 3 times.  

It is easier to pick up a switch than pay attention to good behaviour.  ""You're welcome.  I really like the way you say thank you when I give you something.""  

On the flip side, I acknowledge bad behaviour in unpleasant ways.  If your child is bonded to you, then no longer sharing the bond is catastrophic.  Bad behaviour belongs ""in the hallway"" where I don't have to be around it.    

""Feel what you feel - let me know when we can talk.""  If the child can't stay in the hallway.  Seclude yourself.  (You need an absolutely child-friendly home for this.)  But, the goal is no attention for tantrums.  

There will be one hour long tantrum.  It will desiccate your heart.  You will feel it shrivel up and flake into dust.  You will feel guilty.  You will live through the screaming, tears and snot.  Hopefully - because of one hour, you will not have to feel this feeling frequently.   You may have one tantrum once every six months for years.....if you &lt;I&gt;never, ever, ever&lt;/I&gt; give in.

After 3 years of structure, routine, parental bonding, attentiveness, awareness of his intellectual capability, information, honesty and praise; he has has a fair amount of emotional control.  My not-yet-3-year-old will feel a crying fit coming on and say, ""I need to go to the hallway.""  He goes.  he weeps.  He gets his “mind organised.""  He returns to much praise.  And discussion about the transgression - in his language.   We acknowledge feelings.  We reward and support words about the experience.  We end the diatribe of emotional torrent early.  We find something new to talk about.

&lt;B&gt;Information &lt;/B&gt; 

Expect children to want to be good.  And if goodness is rewarded, then the choice becomes easy.

Recent conversation with my son on a bus.

“Your muddy feet are on this seat.  When we get off, someone will come on.  They’ll sit in your wet, muddy place and have a dirty bum the rest of the day. Do you like having a dirty bum?”

“No.” slipping his feet off the seat.

‘I like the way you always make the right decision.”

Children - for whom people notice their victories - want to receive that positive affirmation of righteousness.  

Where the switch happy thumpers win is with parents who are so self-absorbed and busy meeting their own needs that they don't have time to pay attention.  They don't have time to celebrate, witness goodness and honour the moment righteousness wins over selfishness. 

The positive url above focuses on ""knowing your child.""  That takes time, energy, discipline and commitment.  It is never ending.  Children grow and change and so should parents.  Ultimately - what we are building is a &lt;I&gt;relationship.&lt;/I&gt;  Both sides must grow.  It is unfair to expect growth (which only reflect parental needs).  

But it takes time, patience and willingness to be human.

I can see that there may be various reasons why this might not reflect the true capacity of the student to do maths.  I can see that this is not a good indicator as his worth as a human being.  I can see that it might be demoralising.  I can see that it might put him off maths.  I can also see that the final number depends somewhat arbitrarily on what the teacher considers to be 'nearly' right.  I can see all this.  But all these flaws do not even resemble materialism, because materialism is about the desire for material goods.

It may well be that schools promote an overly materialistic philosophy in America.  If this were the case then I think that is a bad thing.  But telling students whether their answers are correct or not isn't 'desiring material goods', it is about letting them know (inaccurately, perhaps) how much they need to improve before they reach a certain level of competency.  If it is a final exam then it is telling whoever wants to know how competant the student is at solving typical problems as given in the syllabus.  The fact that the student may use that final number to gain material goods is immaterial (so to speak) to the nature of what the grade is.  The same grade could be used to get into university and then become an academic.  Or it could be used to please his dad.  Or it could be to 'prove' he is smarter than his friends.  Only one of these uses is materialistic, and so doesn't itself promote materialism any more than it promotes academia, egoism or utilitarianism.

&gt; Why, as a student, do I have to rely on someone else to tell me whether anything I do is ""good""?

You don't.  But this is irrelevant.  I think you are confusing 'materialism' for 'moral objectivism'.",1141765548

I was also wondering how the protest count in China compares to the US. Not the violence or organization issues, just the number of protests per day and the average number of participants. I guess the numbers would have to be adjusted for population as well. Maybe the statistics are just plain old meaningless, what with them being official government statistics.

And India's in danger because most members of the population aren't English speaking engineers? That's like saying the US economy is in danger because most members of the population are barely qualified to work in Wal-Mart because of our educational system, which is just complete ... umm ...

&gt; Where does Mary come into that?

This is a difference between their culture and our culture. As you'll notice, according to Matthew's account, Joseph is listed as the son of Jacob...in Luke, its Heli. The genealogies throughout are also different in other respects.

And again, this was due to Jewish culture. Luke speaks of Joseph because lineage was never broken down via women in Jewish days. However, Luke's genealogy is Mary's, as due to the difference in the genealogies themselves and Luke's focus on Mary herself.

You have to remember, according to the Biblical account, Jesus was not actually the son of Joseph. Thus, while he had a legal right to the Jewish kingship, he had no physical right. However, Mary's lineage does give him that physical relation. This is likely why the Gospel writers felt it was important to record this.

I don't particularly want to go over all of the ""contradictions"" in the Bible, because I've never ever been given one that didn't result due to a person not looking at the passages in context, or not understanding Jewish tradition.

That's one of the problems I have with the arguements people like Ehmert bring up...their objections generally are very surface level and don't even exist if you actually look at the passages in context.",1141767984

1) Math is not for everyone as some people's brains have difficultly thinking in an abstract ""unknown variable"" manner.  This does not mean that they shouldn't take math, instead, they should have math taught in a more hands-on way.  We have no *real* idea why she kept failing so it is unfair for either author to assume one way or another.  It could have been laziness of the student, or possibly laziness of the teacher, or the method of learning.  They are both missing the big screaming message from all this: The system failed.  If a student fails to graduate because she is missing one class, and the school has no method of helping her graduate through tutors, or self-paced learning. I mean really, where the hell was the academic counselor at when she failed the second time?  third time?  sixth time?!?!  

2)  All subjects of school are important.  Math teaches *analytical* skills that are then used to *communicate effectivly* (as taught in English class) about subjects that have been affected in some way by previous events (read: History!).

"reddit.com","t5_6","You have to go outside the text to account for the contradiction.  The text itself doesn't give the account that you do, but refers to Joseph in both.  

When you selectively add or subtract from a text, you are not doing critical reading, but interpretation.  While some degree of interpretation might be inevitable (especially with a deficient text), it is something I try to avoid, since to the degree that you interpret, you are not reading the text itself, but are reading into the text.

This statement of yours that you don't want to go over the contradictions because they aren't there seems unfair to me.  I have a problem (I see a contradiction), you have solution (it isn't really there by some application of context or tradition), but you won't share.  Why not?

Please note that I have read the NT, and I have read passages in context that still appear to be contradications.  I am very interested the Greco-Roman world in the 1st c., as well as the in Jewish traditions of that time period, and have read a fair amount on them.  I learned ancient Greek, and Latin, and even know a little Hebrew.  

Even given the Jewish tradition, and given the context, I can't reconcile Luke23:46 with John 19:30 cited above.

Python is not a band with a MySpace profile and an awesome debut album. It's a programming language. Programming languages live if they're used, and more or less die if they're not used. Enthusiasts, e.g. reddit users, will find what's cool regardless. Corporations, on the other hand, need to be marketed to. If you love Python, you should love the idea of it putting on a little bit of professional dress -- because that ultimately means you are more likely to actually get paid to program in Python.

Maybe one of the reasons you like Python is because it's kind of like the Rebel base on jungle moon Yavin 4 staging a daring attack on the big bad Static Empire. There's certainly part of me that feels that way. As Python becomes more mainstream you are going to feel some pain. That doesn't mean that the growth is wrong; it means that you are devoted to being alternative. Not necessarily a bad thing.

So, I think I'm going to tell a story.

I drive a Toyota. My first Toyota was a RAV4, and, coming from a Ford, there was a lot of new habits I had to learn (ie: where's the cruise control? how do I use it? where's the 'on' button for the radio? the heat?), and for the first couple of weeks I'd get frustrated about the little things that I kept getting tripped up by (I need to *signal*, not activate the wiper blades).  But I did learn it, and came to deeply appreciate it -- so much so that when I tried to drive a Ford again, I was extremely frustrated with the controls there - even though I had alreadly learned the Ford way of doing things.  The Toyota way was *better* for me.  I'm glad I took the time to learn it.

When someone tries to apply their habits to a new environment (whether it be an OS or a program)  they will *inevitably* become frustrated, particularly if that program helps them do a kind of work that they've never done before.  Does that automatically mean bad design on the part of the environment?  Dear God, I hope not.  I mean, might it just be possible that the designers of that environment might have found a better way to get the task done right?  The UI might have been unexpected *at first*, but if, with some familiarity, the person using that UI discovers that hey, I got my work done in half the time with this method.  That was pretty sharp work on the designer's part.

And even more importantly, group's performance is consistent. A given individual might outperform the group in one decision, but completely fail at the next one. 

With a proper aggregation of the individuals' information, every extra bit of information that any individual has is added to the collective wisdom. It requires special conditions, though. 

See James Surowiecki's The Wisdom of Crowds for more details. It's a counter-intuitive and surprising result, but Surowiecki gives a convincing case for it. He also outlines the other necessary conditions (other than the independence of opinions of the individuals) for groups to be wise.

I have a VW Jetta that I absolutely love, but there is a big useability issue.  The seats have three controls on them.  A black tab in the front, which makes the seat slide forward and back.  Thats totally normal, almost all cars have that.  The others though, are a bit confusing.  The first is a handle on the side of the seat.  Ahh, that must make the seat tilt forwards and backwards like in almost all cars right?  Wrong, instead pushing down on it causes the seat to lower, and pulling up raises the seat.  So how do you tilt the seat?  There is a knob, that you must turn that causes the seat to tilt. Furthermore, you practically need to be double jointed in order to operate it. 

If VW had followed the tenant, then the operation of those two controls would have been reversed. Though the method of operation of the two controls closely match the actual action that the seat performs, pumping up and down causes vertical motion, and twisting forward and back titls, I still have to explain to most passengers how to operate their seat since they expect the controls to operate like all the other seat controls that they have encountered.

Seems pretty realistic to me. You don't deal with situations like getting a girl pregnant, getting some nasty STDs (we don't need links do we?), and situations like this.

Seems like a win-win situation. Just takes a little self-control.

But let's use some logical thinking here: would he even be in that situation if he hadn't had sex (oral sex for one of them) with two different teenage girls to begin with? He kind of put himself in this position, whether he likes it or not.

While I do think the sentence is way too high (10 years is crazy), the truth is, teenage girls are very easily pressured into doing things. Its a case by case basis, but this girl could've been led into doing things that she wouldn't have normally done. Many girls would do many things to get noticed by a star football player/prom king. There have to be some kind of laws to protect younger girls like that. While its not technically child molestation, it isn't something that should be freely allowed.

I don't know how many of you have daughters, but a gaurantee you that most of you would not be okay with your 15-year old having sex with guys. Most of you that is to say, not all of you. Currently the girl still lives with her parents and is under legal protection of them. If they feel like she has been pressured into doing something, they have every right to press appropriate charges.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Stock/futures market is a perfect example of a group with wisdom. Such a market calculates (and thus predicts) with remarkable accuracy the future value of a company. Remember that predicting is a _really hard_ problem. 

Markets do sometimes go awry --think of stock market bubbles and crashes-- but compared to the normal state, these outliers are but a statistical noise. Bubbles and crashes do of course have a significant effect on people's lives so they're certainly undesirable. But if you just evaluate market's general effectiveness as a mechanism to valuate companies, a market is by far the best system (we currently know) for it.

The specific problem markets in general solve is of course the valuation of goods. Market is such a good solution to the problem that it's hard to even think of a market as a system for aggregating collective wisdom. Just try to imagine a trading system where prices of goods is determined by a single person. 

Surowiecki's book is filled with examples about markets and he seems to have a specific interest in internal special purpose prediction markets. I would guess that the implementors of Inkling have read the book, or similar accounts of the subject. I suppose Inkling could be sold to companies as a tool for prediction about the issues a given company is interested in.

even if you had one single black and white age of adult-hood. one age of consent, for drinking, for driving, for the draft, for voting, etc, let us assume 18. even then, what of the 17 year old couples when one of them turns 18? does she suddenly become a paedophile? so obviously that is silly as well.

"reddit.com","t5_6","There's really no need to replicate diamond:  a company called Charles &amp; Colvard manufactures a white/clear gemstone called moissanite (chemically, Silicon Carbide) that is actually prettier than diamond.

Technical specifications on brilliance, fire, and luster are superior to diamond, and durability is not an issue - moissanite is the 2nd hardest mineral known to man.  (Behind diamond.)  Also, since it is manufactured and quality-controlled, all stones are near-flawless.

More info at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite

Captian2 - After comparing stones side-by-side with my fiance, we decided on a moissanite ring.  I ended up custom-designing a beautiful ring that ended up costing 30% of what it would cost for a diamond ring of similar size and quality.  She is thrilled with it, and gets compliments about it constantly.

IMO, wedding rings do two things: (1) provide a symbol / memento of the event (i.e. they have sentimental value, not asset/investment value) and (2) look pretty.  Moissanite accomplishes these things while preventing you from starting off your married life thousands of dollars in debt.  

If your future wife insists on natural diamond, and doesn't care if it costs you a lot more for what is essentially the same end product, chances are you're marrying the wrong woman.  Spend the money you save on a kick-ass honeymoon.

They don't give you all the information you need to solve the problem down to one solution.  Take some coin weighing problem: ""Given this info about your setup, determine which is the heavier coin.""  Okay, sure you could say, ""Well, there are an infinite number of solutions because the puzzle-teller could be lying about the setup.""  That's bogus because in math you are constantly taking ""givens"" as your assumptions which you use to get an answer.  

Or, you might argue that you could hold the coins in slightly different ways when you weighed and thus get an  infinite number of solutions.  That's totally fine.  In this case, your solution would fall in the equivalence class of valid solutions.  

But the problem with number sequence problems is that you have no way of testing your answer.  In my previous example, there was a set of answers.  In a number sequence problem, you can't test if your solution is right.

The analogy to abortion just doesn't fit:

&gt;Feit counters that the suit's reference to abortion rights is apt.
&gt;
&gt;""Roe says a woman can choose to have intimacy and still have control over subsequent consequences,"" he said. ""No one has ever asked a federal court if that means men should have some similar say.""

But the court *hasn't* said that women have control over the ""subsequent consequences of intimacy"". The court has said that their right to privacy means that they can do what they please with their bodies. Men also have that right. They thus have equal protection under the law w.r.t. pregnancy. If a man got pregnant, he could also have an abortion. This amounts to a lawsuit against the federal government because men cannot get pregnant. Men's rights FTW.

**Edit**: And the description of the plaintiff's situation doesn't really make sense to me either. It sounds unfair, but only because it sounds like his partner lied to him in order to become pregnant. If that is the case, then it seems like her actions should constitute fraud. If that is not the case, then it doesn't sound particularly unfair to me at all. It's equally unfair to both of them.

However, on a more serious note, let us imagine that these people are representative. In a representative democracy the will of the people is manifest in the government, which acts on that will. Since the U.S. seems to feel that it can act without the cooperation of the United Nations (which I'm not arguing for or against - it is simply a fact), then, the U.S. could in principle make decisions about what to do with a very large army based on this kind of stupidity.

Of course, there is no way this would happen. There are a hell of a lot of very dedicated and educated people in, for example, the CIA. The CIA World Factbook (online) is pretty much the classic geographic 'state of the world' reference. I use it in teaching all of the time.

Because creationism is believed because it's part of a very important social construct --the church. But belief in rationality has no necessary constraint to be founded in a social construct.

It is easy to argue (irrationally, but compellingly) that believing in a non-socially necessary idea will make you anti-social. Likewise, it would be also argued that not believing in something socially necessary like religion will ostracize you from the community that values the beliefs of the church.

"reddit.com","t5_6","No, I am saying the exact opposite of hxa7241.  hxa7241 says that all puzzles are arbitrary.  I am saying that number sequence puzzles are *not* arbitrary.

Ordinary, non-mathematician humans will agree that the ""right"" answer to the 2,4,6,8 puzzle is not 2&amp;pi; but 10.  Even if you produce some elaborate explanation of why it is 2&amp;pi; and not 10, they will still understand that you are just being an ass.

Mathematicians will also understand that you are being an ass.  Mathematicians spend plenty of research time on problems of this type.  For example:  you are given a sequence of points; find a curve that passes through the points.  Obviously, there are many such curves.   In the impoverished world of the author of this article, no further answer is possible, because every one of the many curves is as good as another. 

And yet better answers than this *are* possible.  Mathematicians have invented cubic splines, for example, which have certain useful and valuable properties.  These properties are why cubic splines are a better answer to the question than some curve chosen at random.  Bezier splines are another possible answer.  While nobody would want to say that Bezier curves were always a better answer than cubic splines, both of them are better answers than some random doodle involving 2&amp;pi;. 

So, contrary to this author's claim, there *are* absolute reasons to consider one answer better than another.    Many problems have multiple answers.  This does not make them ill-posed or unanswerable.

In science, you always have the choice of several different philosophical approaches to your work.  The Creationist philosophy is to answer every question with ""because God made it that way.""  Why do we have grooves on our fingers?  Because God made them that way.  Why did God make them that way?  It's a mystery.  Such a philosophy is not scientifically useful or interesting.  It cannot lead to better understanding of the grooves.

An alternative philosophy is to consider the possibility that the grooves evolved through natural selection.  Then you have the option to investigate the possible function of the grooves.  Maybe the grooves make it easier for monkeys to hold clubs, and the monkeys with grooves killed all the monkeys without grooves.  Then you can go look for evidence and study the problem.  Unlike ""Because God made it that way,"" this approach is not an immediate dead end.  It points the way to an increase in understanding.

The author's philosophical approach is just as worthless as one that says ""the next number in the sequence is whatever God wills it to be.""   Instead of taking the commonsensical approach of (a) observing that certain answers to certain number sequence problems are superior to other answers, and (b) attempting an honest inquiry into why this is so, an inquiry that could result in many useful and interesting contributions to mathematical knowledge, the author's approach is to take the lazy way out and refuse to even consider the question.

And he has to work so hard to take the lazy way out!  He has to convince himself that 2&amp;pi; is as good an answer to the question of what follows 2,4,6,8 as 10 is.  It takes a powerful lot of brainpower to come up with such a stupid idea. 

I don't want to overstate the closeness of the comparison I am making between the author's lazy approach and the Creationists'.  There are many points at which there is no correspondence.  I bring up Creationism only to make the point that the author's philosophical approach is just as intellectually bankrupt as Creationism, and for the same reasons:  Faced with a large class of potentially interesting questions, it flushes the inquiries down the toilet.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&lt;blockquote&gt;The court has said that their right to privacy means that they can do what they please with their bodies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I've always found this ""right to do what they please with their bodies"" phrase to be one of the most confusing of the entire abortion debate.  Maybe you (or someone else here) can clarify to me what it means, because I think I'm misunderstanding it.  The way I interpret it, the following two things make it seem incorrect:

1) Even if it were clear that a fetus is part of a woman's ""own body"", it is obvious that people don't have the right to do what they want with their own bodies.  You don't have the right put your hands over someone's throat so that the person suffocates to death.  You don't have the right to put your body in the path of a moving vehicle.  You don't even have the right to slit your wrists and kill yourself, and you can be hospitalized if a doctor thinks you might.  On less extreme terms, you don't have a right to put your body where you want (breaking &amp; entering and trespassing laws), use it to move air in the way you want (screaming fire in a crowded theater), use it to take what you want (theft), etc.  In fact, most every law in modern societies restricts what a person can do with his or her ""own body"".

2) It is not clear that a fetus is a woman's ""own body"".  From a genetic standpoint, each cell in it descends from only half of her genetic material, which sets them apart from every other cell in her body.  From this perspective, it's as much the father's body as the mother's.  From a physical standpoint, the fetus is not connected to her body and her blood does not flow through it like the rest of her body.  The placenta is ""implanted"" on the wall of the uterus, but the part of it that is genetically descended from the fetus is not part of the mother's body.  Of course the fetus proper is suspended in the amniotic sac and is not attached at all to the mother's body.

So, I can't make any sense of the ""right to do what she wants with her own body"" phrase.  Can someone explain it to me?",1142011226

Intelligent design (ID) is the concept that ""certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.""[1] Its leading proponents, all of whom are affiliated with the Discovery Institute[2], say that intelligent design is a scientific theory that stands on equal footing with, or is superior to, current scientific theories regarding the origin of life"".[3]

Pure and simple, ID theories are ""not science because they cannot be tested by experiment, do not generate any predictions and propose no new hypotheses of their own.""

Yet the Discovery Institute claims ID is a scientific theory at least on EQUAL footing with the current theory of evolution.  It's not.  Presenting ID as a scientific theory is manipulative and misleading.  It preys on the general public's ignorance.

I think the majority of people don't really ""get"" natural selection, and as such can't truly grok the process.  They fall back on a simpler, more convenient explanation: God did it.  Which, several hundred years ago at least, was the explanation for everything.  Lightning?  God did it.  Disease? God did it.  But there's no strength, no scientific rigor to those answers because ""they cannot be tested by experiment, do not generate any predictions and propose no new hypotheses of their own"".

Science has slowly marginalized religion's everyday relevence because it's just plain better at answering ""why"".  A fundamental tenant of evangelical Christians is that the bible is perfect and without error.  Well, that 2000+ year old explanation of the origin of man has been usurped by a better theory.  A lot of powerful people have a LOT to lose if the current evolutionary theory is as widely accepted as most other scientific theories.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The point isn't gas stations, per se (just like Who Moved My Cheese? isn't to be taken literally). The point is that your customer service behavior has repercussions well beyond the current transaction. It's like the classic Stew Leonard's story about the woman who returned spoilt milk, only to have Stew Sr. argue with her that it couldn't be newly-purchased and be spoiled already. She stormed out, and never returned. Stew then realized the lifetime value of the customer lost and made up that silly rock that sits in the entranceway of all his stores (""Rule 1: customer is always right Rule 2: If the customer is wrong, refer to rule 1"").

As for brand/customer loyalty for gas stations, you're wrong to some degree. I don't buy certain brands because of perceived quality, and others because of customer service. If I don't find someone significantly cheaper than my station, regardless of proximity, I go to my preferred station (and it's not the closest). Obviously, where I am at the time I run low plays a role, too.

Is there as much customer loyalty in gas stations as there is in other things? Probably not. But, scratch most consumers and you'll find they have a preferred station (not necessarily a preferred brand, although I'm sure familiarity breeds some preference).

For example, until I got the Hess Visa (5% back on gas purchases), I bought from Mobil when I was in CT - good quality, decent price, and I liked the convenience of Speedpass. Wasn't the closest station, but its locations weren't bad. Once we moved to NJ, we hadn't developed any real preference (there were 3 or 4 areas with decent prices, and everything is full service), although we tended to look at this one independent who had pleasant attendants and wasn't too far from the house.

So, is it really strong loyalty? No. Is it loyalty? Yes.

The last paragraph of my comment is somewhat explanatory. The exact issue you bring up is thoroughly discussed in both of the linked threads.

&gt; Since the abortion methods I'm aware of don't intentionally do anything to the uterus, that doesn't seem very relevant.

Obviously they do. They *empty* the uterus. If you would like to nitpick further on that issue, you are being a twit. If pregnancy didn't have anything to do with a woman's body, then I would not be opposed to anti-abortion legislation. You have a right to a medical procedure that would remove something unwanted from your body, especially one that had effects as extreme as pregnancy. You think that right is trumped by the right of the fetus to live. I don't.

I think that forcing a woman to supply her body to her fetus for 9 months is perhaps a lesser intrusion than forcing you to give me your kidney, but an intrusion of the same kind. A violation of your right to your body. This, of course, has nothing to do with Roe vs Wade.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; ...quite a few of the algorithms in my Bioinformatics class use Dynamic Programming. I have no idea how this would be done in Haskell...

I guess you'd do dynamic programming in any functional language the way you'd write any iterative program: by passing along the ""state"", i.e. local variables in which you're memoizing the partial results, as arguments to recursive calls. That's really the right way to do it in OCaml as well; if you're using mutable cells instead, you're not really programming in a functional style, and it's harder to rigorously reason about the correctness of your program.

For example, computing the *n*th Fibonacci number in C:

    int fibonacci (int n) {
      int a = 0, b = 1;
      while (n--) {
        int t = b;
        b = b + a;
        a = t;
      }
      return a;
    }

The same thing in ML:

    fun fibonacci n =
      let
        fun fibhelper 0 a b = a
          | fibhelper n a b = fibhelper (n-1) b (a+b)
      in
        fibhelper n 0 1
      end

[According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), though, you don't even *need* to do dynamic programming in Haskell, because the absolute functional purity of Haskell allows it to do it for you:

&gt; Some functional programming languages, most notably Haskell, can automatically memoize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up call-by-name evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as call-by-need). This is only possible for a function which has no side-effects, which is always true in Haskell but seldom true in imperative languages.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'm a regular OCaml user, I've even been paid to do so at some point. I know Haskell quite well, although I never had a professional position involving it (are there any, apart from teaching?)

Haskell definitely teaches enlightening stuffs, and everyone should have learned it so that he writes better code in other languages (as ESR said about lisp), but being purely functional is a terrible hassle in most real cases. I'm comfortable with monads, and even use them in non-Haskell projects when suitab,le but it has to be recognised for what it is: a design pattern, and a fairly heavy one. 

I mean, I completely agree with Haskell people when they cry over the heaviness of visitor patterns in, say, Java: it's just unbearable once you've tried a language which supports algebraic datatypes. Yet monadic I/O are just a contrived way to shoehorn imperative thinking into a functional framework, exactly the way visitor pattern is a contrived way to shoehorn data deconstruction in an OO framework. 

OCaml makes it quite easy to separate between functional and imperative bits, yet if you do want to mix them at some point, you can. And in an application, there's always that little sub-problem that's essentially imperative, and which will cripple the whole system, should you shoehorn it in a monad; OCaml avoids this. 

As an example, look at SPJ's Template Haskell, a meta-programming framework in Haskell. The whole API is polluted with many subtly different versions of syntax tree constructors, because there is a complicated monadic system underneath. And what's all this monadic behemoth for? The point is to ""cleanly"" handle a _symbol generator_ ! Yes, that stupid gensym thing! Come on!

When it comes to laziness, sure it allows extremely witty and terse bits of code on some selected subjects, but at the cost of difficult-to-assess execution path and algorithmic complexity; I personnaly prefer the ""eager by default, lazy if you ask"" approach one finds in OCaml, rather than the opposite found in Haskell; I guess it depends on the kind of  problems you consider typical, but 95%+ of people will find that eager-by-default works best.

As for syntax, I completely agree with the post: Haskell is by far the most elegant syntax I've ever met (although some might argue that lisp has its own, special elegance), and OCaml's one is a bit awkward. But you get used to it, and it is customisable with the camlp4 parser.",1142029576

-----------------------CITE----------------
But yes, most of us in evolutionary biology do tend to think that ID is absolutely ridiculously stupid, and we have a hard time conceiving how anyone intelligent could believe in it.
---------------------------------------------
You know Richard Dawkins ? What do you think of his intellectual capabilities ? Now, Richard believes (please correct me if I am wrong) that ideas which he called ""memes"" can infest our brains and infect others via communication.
Do you think that it is a viable scientific theory (or hypothesis) with can be falsified, tested or proved ? A thing as a meme which shares with God invisibility, untouchability, lack of matter or energy and which is still able to influence most of short-lived changes in human behaviour like language, art etc. etc. ?
And according to Occams Razor, why introduce such a thing if there are many other more sophisticated theories about the change in human behaviour which don't need such a thing ?

Tell me the difference between ID and ""memes"".

"reddit.com","t5_6","_""If you don't believe in such a thing as objective truth, then why bother arguing?""_

If you believe in such a thing as objective truth, you're one step closer to believing you're in possession of it. So of course anybody who argues with you is stupid/wrong/Satanic.

Perhaps you would prefer me to phrase it thus: yes there is an objective truth, but we'll never find it. All we have to come close to it with is our social networks. Even science, that thing which can do no wrong, depends crucially on the review process, on convincing others that what you're saying makes sense and is interesting. Without an audience to keep us honest, our minds can rationalize anything.

Practicality is clearly important. I'm not going to argue with every crackpot notion out there, it's not worth my time. But if a competing meme has enough people backing it, and who wins has an impact on our lives, then it is worth our time to try to arrive at a consensus. And you will never arrive at a consensus by being sure you're right.

Consensus is not compromise. I doubt I can be convinced that the world was built in 7 days. But if I want to convince someone else otherwise, I have to first understand his belief-system intimately. In the process I am sure from past experience that I will learn something. And I wouldn't learn it if I was sure from the start that he was an idiot (or a fucking moron), that everything I thought was right.

My point* is that we are all fundamentally equally irrational. The armies of people on both sides of this debate (myself included) haven't really spent a huge amount of time on average thinking about it. Therefore there is less difference than you might realize between your belief in science and someone else's belief in religion. Like Daniel Dennett said:

if you delegate to experts, recuse yourself from the argument. Only he was applying it selectively to the other side.

But those small site owners have a hard enough time with FRONTPAGE, and we're tossing them out there to make a form from scratch?

This site should be guiding people through the creation of the form, not just making it easy to make one from scratch... otherwise, people won't pay for it.

To succeed, I think wufoo needs to guide people through creating common types of forms the same way Office apps guide you through creating common documents. Hand-hold the person to a default form, and then let them customize it.

(2) Security (see 1 - it's a plugin).  JavaScript is sandboxed - making it much safer for the user than some arbitrary binary that can (AFAIK), among other things, write to the user's hard drive.  Sure, there might be a bug in the browser that makes JavaScript a security hole, but you have that anyway, using flash just needlessly introduces another potential attack vector.

(3) It may be easier for JavaScript (The term AJAX is a gross misnomer) to manipulate the DOM and play well with other ""web 2.0""ish things.  Here I'm not sure - perhaps someone with more Flash experience can tell me how well Flash plays with other JavaScript, etc.?

Kerry voted against a bill that included funding for body armor.  In that bill was a lot of stuff that was good (ie, body armor) but some things that were bad (don't recall what those were).  Kerry voted ""no"" on the bill.  Later, he was asked if he was ""for"" body armor.  He said ""of course!"".  Next day, Kerry flip-flops on body armor.

Kerry voted ""for"" the war, but a year later thought it was a bad idea.  Flip-flop.  However: the assessment a year later was based on new information (faulty CIA intelligence).  To not reassess would be stupid, but he was labeled a flip-flopper.

The unsettling idea that our fellow countrymen's tacit approval of trading liberty for security may eventually lead to trading all of our liberty away for security (totalitarian regimes rarely have any problem with terrorism, uprisings, etc. because they are picked up by informers long before fruition); this troubles some people who figure that it's always best to avoid questioning the President.  When, in fact, the Constitution is all about the People's rights to question everything about the government, and assumes that it will be upheld by bloodshed if necessary.

Russia went from democracy to totalitarianism in 12 years.  What is to say that the United States cannot?  Are we somehow better human beings than the Russians?

"reddit.com","t5_6","There are liberals, and then there are partisan democrats.  Lots of liberals voted against Kerry and for Nader in 2000.  

The left is not at all like the right.  On the left there is not nearly as much homogeneity of views.  There is no attempt to establish a party line and enforce it.  Dissent from a standard view is not viewed as negative.  There is a lot more distrust and criticism of anyone in power.  Remember that there was a lot of railing from the left against Clinton.  While in general the left did not rail on him for the blowjob, or 'Whitewater,' that was because those were largely political attacks from the right.  The right has a strong streak of anti-intellectualism that lets them ignore or forgive the hypocrisy of their leaders, the left is generally more educated, and doesn't tolerate anti-intellectuallism, and are actually pleased with having nuanced views.

I'm not saying that the left are perfect, super-intellectuals, or incapable of supporting an odious politican (look at Nader), but I would say that there is not one clear block that is the 'left', the folks who identify themselves as the 'left' are not as inclined to hero-worshipping and the cult of personality, and it would be a *lot* harder to rally the left behind a president pulling the kind of garbage Bush is pulling.",1142109347

The original purpose of buying stock is to own a part of the company, yes. But most people nowadays buy stock to make money. When Google opened at $100/share, a lot of people bought it, because they knew the price would go up. Businesses knew this too, which is why it was included in most mutual funds at the time. A couple months ago, when people (and mutual fund companies) started thinking that the price of Google's stock had reached it's maximum, they sold it. Because of the rapid selling, the stock dropped $70 in three days, from $470 to $400. However, anyone who bought Google stock when it opened and sold it at that time had just made $370/share, an amazing profit in a year and a half.

Here is an excellent example of them working together:

""Another high point in the twelfth century was the collaboration of two scholars, one Christian and the other Muslim, on a series of translations of dozens of works from Arabic into Latin (by way of Spanish).  The works included texts in astronomy, medicine, mathematics and philosophy.  The Christian was Gerard of Cremona, and his good friend and colleague was the Muslim Ghalib the Mozarab.""

And of Jewish importance:

""Finally, Abu-Imran Musa Ibn-Maymun, ""Maimonides"" (1135-1204), preeminent Jewish philosopher of the Middle Ages was born in Cordoba. Maimonides wrote his most famous work, Dalalat al-Ha’ireen (""Guide of the Perplexed"") in Arabic, an attempt to reconcile Jewish theology with Muslim Aristotelianism. Maimonides has been touted as one of the best examples of the mutual tolerance between Muslims, Jews, and Christians that led to the cultural flowering in Andalus in the medieval period. However, the fact is he was forced out of Cordoba during a purge by the puritanical Muslim al-Mohads about 1165 after which he moved to Cairo where he served as court physician to Salah al-Din (Saladin) and where he died.""

Yeah, I know, wikipedia is not authoritative, and often articles aren't neutral, but this is just an example; everywhere in the media we see him reported like this, so forgive me if there's a small chance that he was an entirely innocent man, but I always thought it was a given that he was guilty, and that the trial was just a formality.

Besides, even if he wasn't guilty of killing hundreds of thousands, the chances that he was entirely innocent of ordering **any** civilians killed are slim; how likely is it that the UN would've conducted a lengthy and expensive trial if they weren't pretty much convinced of his guilt?  I'm all for human rights and all, and I think that it would be wrong to imprison him without a fair trial, but here I'm talking more about ""cosmic justice"", if you will; it seems unjust that a man who we all **know** is guilty (even if we can't prove it) passed away peacefully in his old age, when so many others were murdered in their prime because of him.",1142156811

"reddit.com","t5_6","Wrong, memes cannot be tested and I will explain why. I can write much about it, but a lack of space and perhaps interest will secure that I keep concise.

First, to test meme transferral we must come to an agreement what memes are actually are and how to identify them, correct ? Anti-ID rightfully pointed out that ID remain suspiciously vague who the designer is: If someone claims they are aliens, we have the question who created the aliens (chicken-egg problem). God is a supernatural solution and is useless because it can explain every secret and is therefore no explanation at all.

So what are memes ? Dawkins explained them as an analogy to viral code in computers; information which can replicate itself. So in case of humans they are thoughts. Dawkins even
goes so far that religions are bad memes.

Now, how are we going to get sure that memes exist ? In case of computer viruses this is easy: We can write down the binary code, looks what it does according to the processor and see that it is capable to replicate itself. We cannot look into someone's brains (we can locate currents and temperature and activity of special zones, but that aren't thoughts). So we are forced to rely on speech and writings alone. What Dawkins will call ""meme transfer"" isn't much more than talking with other people. Now, if the meaning of meme has any sense at all, it must divide talking into irrelevant talking and meme transfer. Otherwise you give talking just another synonym -&gt; Occam.

Define ""successful meme transfer"". As example we take the word ""meme"" itself. Is it when people understand the concept, but misheard it (""Uh, these mimoses infect my brain ?""), if the people spelled it correctly, but don't understand it (""Memes are new biological organism which are transferred by sound waves.""), if people (like in urban legends) attach own personal additions and worldviews to it (""Memes are apart from their Dawkins meaning holistic spirits which are engulfed in our soul."").

Come up with a definition how to detect memes and memes transfer and I will tear it apart in no time concerning strictness, repeatability and falsifiability. It is junk science. And no, I am not a ID proponent. But ID is embarassingly for Dawkins and in contrast to your assumption testable because the term ""irreducibly complex"" is defineable. So the opponents of ID who take it earnest haven't said that the concept of IC is not falsifiable (which would be wrong), but that functions may develop from unintended side effects or that gradual development may have in fact a positive effect on survival which is not evidently at the first moment. Or the possibility of mutation with the intended effect is grossly underestimated.",1142196160

All I'm saying is that we'll never have all of it. So we keep looking. When I think I have it all I will roll over and die.

_""Our minds can rationalize anything even with an audience attempting to keep us honest. Better to just leave it at 'our minds can rationalize anything', and I'll agree.""_

I'm not offering guarantees here, that an audience will keep you from groupthink. An audience is a huge help on average. The review process is the fundamental difference between science and alchemy before it.

I stand by my original statement (rephrased): The truth of a proposition is more confidently established when it is exposed to scrutiny in a social network. If you're having trouble with this scrutiny you have 2 choices: either change the proposition (not a single atomic fact but a subgraph of the semantic network) or change the social network.

In this case, changing the social network seems a poor option because it would involve civil war/secession/genocide. So we need to understand the belief systems of the other side intimately. For example, perhaps their push for creationism in schools comes from a deep-rooted fear that their children will lose their religion (admit it, that has happened a lot) by being exposed too much to science*. In that case we must find common ground by addressing this concern.

It doesn't help that the other side is largely unable to come half-way in this process. But they're hampered by their belief system. That's no excuse for us to be like them. I hold my side to a higher standard.

I don't think you're right when you say the rating system drives out the mainstream. That would imply that in my conversations with my friends, where theoretically there should be an even stronger feedback loop, it would be difficult to discuss unorthodox ideas. I don't find that. The face-to-face feedback loop would indeed prevent me from sarcastically dismissing my friend's idea of looking at Paul Graham's blog, but it wouldn't prevent me from making a joke about how much Paul Graham I already have in my bloodstream.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Let's decompose your reply; it seems more efficient to reply to each sentence separately. 

&gt; What kind of advantage do you feel clearly defined development processes bring to a software business or to a IT department? 

""Clearly defined development processes"" are an MBA's way of disguising hacking because he's afraid of calling it hacking. Hacking has been talked about at length by intelligent people, and you can tell whether the person talking about it understands it or not based on whether they call it hacking or ""development processes."" People who call it hacking are usually hackers themselves, and therefore understand that hacking is usually a solitary, high-concentration activity that involves peace, quiet, and few interruptions. People who call it ""development processes"" usually haven't the first clue about hacking, and want to turn it into an assembly-line process that they can control, rather than an erratic, creative process.

&gt; Do you think it is advantageous for the parties involved to use the trial and error method to validate similar processes in similar businesses, each on their own? 

No. I think hackers should learn how to hack, and then get hired because they're good hackers. If you have good hackers in your company, they will hack good code their own way, and the end product will be vastly more useful and functional than if some MBA tries to impose ""industry standard development processes"" on them. 

&gt; How about training, do you think it's a good use of a software development company's time to develop their own training material and courses? 

No. Learning how to hack is not something you do on the job. You learn how to hack on your own time because you love it, and maybe you learn some new languages or tools on the job, but if you're a reasonably competent person, you should be able to just learn those on the fly without using ""training material and courses.""",1142209601

However, very few anti-abortionists support punative measures against abortionists, so even they don't act as though it's exactly the same as murder. Still, in the end the question is whether something horrible is happening or not, so it's not just a matter of personal conscience.

"reddit.com","t5_6","As someone else pointed out, this headline is quite misleading.

Creationism is a movement by Baptist fundamentalists in the US founded and spurred by Dr. Henry Morris and the Institute for Creation Research with some other minor Christian geologists and scientists who tend to interpret the Bible literally:

http://www.icr.org/
http://www.christiananswers.net/creation/people/morris-h.html

Intelligent Design, on the other hand, is not a specifically Christian or fundamentalist movement but may include Christians of widely varying theological backgrounds including Catholics and Protestants.  ID advocates do not necessarily argue for creation *ex nihilo* or discount all aspects of evolutionary theory.  ID also includes scientists with impeccable academic credentials granted by secular institutions that match or exceed what the Darwinist mainline academy has deigned to meet their standards of formal or informal accreditation.  They also appear in legitimate peer-reviewed journals even though the view is not very popular compared to orthodox Darwinism.

A good example of an ID scientist would be Dr. Michael Behe, Professer of Biochemistry at Lehigh University and author of ""Darwin's Black Box"":

http://www.arn.org/authors/behe.html

Another example of a well-known Intelligent Design advocate would be Dr. William Dembski, author of several monographs on ID:

http://www.designinference.com/

Disclosure: Dembski has two Ph.D's, one in Mathematics from the University of Chicago and one in Philosophy from the Univerity of Illinois in Chicago.  Some of his harshest critics play up the fact that Dembski's authority is limited because he does not hold a Biology or Biochem degree.  However, a Mathematics Ph.D from U of Chicago prevents Dembski from being discounted out of hand by some academic Darwinists.

Of course, impressive academic credentials alone aren't very helpful for promulgating a particular position in the public Darwinist/Creationist/Intelligent Design debate if you aren't a good writer, capable communicator, and if you cannot bring your A-game to this discussion.

In addition, The Discovery Institute sponsors Intelligent Design books, papers, and news:

http://www.discovery.org/csc/

I say this not to advocate or evangelise for any one view, but to point out that it's disingenuous to speak of ""Creationism"" in reference to a position that is neither classic Creationism (*ex nihilo* in six twenty-four hour days) or necessarily non-evolutionary or even theistic.

Second, your examples are beside the point.  He never said that he did all his projects in ruby, nor that ruby is always a win.  It has been, apparently, a win in all of the cases that he has encountered, but it need not be for him to engage in arbitrage.  If it is a win in even one situation, and the cost of having ruby as an option is 0, then he can choose ruby for the projects for which it is well-suited, while avoiding it on the projects for which it is poorly suited.  Note that this is isomorphic to the case in which a vendor V in a market has an extra supplier S that is not known by his competitors.  If S sometimes has a better price than the rest of the suppliers in the market, then V can engage in arbitrage by buying from S when the price was better and from someone else when it was not.  Assuming the cost of keeping S 'on retainer' is negligible, this allows for strictly non-negative advantage, which is, in fact, arbitrage.

Second-and-a-halfly, if we're going to pick nits, arbitrage does not require that you must always get strictly positive results.  It requires that you get strictly non-negative ones.  It is exceedingly strange that someone who wants to pick nits missed that.",1142233226

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'm not specifically focusing on startups, but my comments do apply to those startups I've been part of. Programming the apps initially is trivial compared to the more demanding tasks coming up ahead when you start getting customers. You need to integrate your app to your customer's environment, some customers are absolutely adamant in demanding that you must run save your data on the corporate standard Oracle, which doesn't make sense to you but makes sense to them.

One of their reasons is that for general applications, you can really use any reasonably SQL92-compliant database, and so it makes sense to have your app work on, say, Derby, Oracle and DB2, depending on the expected traffic. Taking your customer's preferences into account without a priori judgements will make your sales so much easier.

After you succeed, you'll have a situation where you've given your word to support your customers, you'll have new apps coming out and a sales effort going to sell to both your old customers and new markets, and at this lull you'll have a spike of turnover and new hires. This is what I consider the most critical phase for success - if you rein in your cowboys and consolidate on industry standard tools, you'll have a succesful software business, because the game is all about getting your people to concentrate on doing the right things for your business as a group instead of concentrating on locally optimizing their own jobs.",1142245087

"reddit.com","t5_6","Hey, I like answering questions like this.  Of course it's always great when people are curious about your field (unless they're trying to get me to trip up, this ""proving"" evolution is false).  Anyway, as for the answers:

1) There are many changes in DNA, such as in noncoding regions or in the 3rd position of codons, that do not seem to have an effect on the fitness of the organism.  However, a more interesting answer to your questions would be that Mootoo Kimura came up with a whole branch of evolutionary thinking called the Neutral Theory.  He postulates that the large majority of mutations confer neither an advantage nor a disadvantage, and that evolution is therefore the result of those mutations gradually becoming either fixed or lost from the population.

2) There are regions of the genome known as mutational ""hot spots"" that seem to undergo much more mutation than other regions.  The most interesting example that I can think of is the p53 gene, which tends to mutate in response to UV radiation, leading to cancer.  However, I have not heard of situations where this affected evolution.  Generally when two distinct populations converge to have similar traits, they use different genes to do it.  Other than that, transitions (C--&gt;T and A--&gt;G) are more likely to occur than other changes (transversions), simply because the structures of the nucleotides are more similar.

During a career development class for undecided freshman, students were encouraged to talk with a faculty member in an area they'd like to major. A student approached the instructor and said, ""How am I supposed to talk with the faculty person?"" Instructor said, ""I dunno. Maybe a telephone?"" The student instead had his mom call the faculty member to arrange it. Mom said, ""Hi. My son is supposed to meet with you.  What times work for you?""

Puzzled, the faculty member said, ""You are calling on your son's behalf to arrange an interview? Why not just have the son call? This isn't really the best way to take care of things."" Mom said, ""Oh, he's standing right here, but wanted me to call.""

The point is that this type of dependency is brand new. I see students who are more sheltered, more conservative, more Don't Rock the Boat, than ever. More people who have no idea the nature of the world they live in, and unforunately, more students eat the heaping spoons of bullshit that comes from society than ever before. 

Some are demanding and plain fucking rude. Some look down on people in the janitorial and maintanance departments as below them. They think that my job in my department is to meet their every need, regardless of the policies and procedures. If they come to me with an idea of how something could be changed, their expectation is that I will immediately make that change.

"reddit.com","t5_6","No, it's really the same thing.  TSP comes in two forms.  One is the optimization form, in which one asks for the path of minimum cost.  The other is the decision form, which gives a budget and asks whether there is a path that comes in under budget.  And in fact the canonical version is the decision form, which is the one you say you don't like.

But the Elmo problem has the same two versions.  The one described in the article is the decision form, which asks if there is a distribution of all segments.  But you can pose it as an optimization problem instead, in which case you  ask for the maximum number of segments that can be simultaneously packaged into thematically-consistent videos.

## Types of ratings:


There are a number of ways that we could have users rank articles:

 1. Sort articles in order of preference.

 2. Score articles from 1 to 10 without first seeing the current score like on hotornot.

 3. Tagging articles to put them into different categories.

 4. Rating an article *after* seeing the community rating like reddit. A less flexible version of this would be a site like dig.

 5. Also rating other users and using this rating to help determine the ratings of articles (this is a whole another category.)

Each of these has its benefits and some haven't even been explored fully yet.
My argument is that, biases aside, types (2) (4) and even (1) are the *same*.

## Similarities in rating systems:

When a user rates the comments on a reddit page, for example, he:

 A) First gets a feel for the vote density that this page has received. For example, if the highest scored comment has a +50 score, then this sets the bar to compare the scores of the other comments to.

 B) Now, as the user rates comments on the page he bases his vote or absence of a vote on whether he thinks the comment's *current score is accurate*. **He is no longer just voting up,down or novote but participating with the community in
choosing a score within a much larger range!** He is doing type (2) voting with some extra bias from the community.

B can readily be seen in action in that almost no one votes on every comment or every article that they come across.

## Pros, Cons of bias:

So now that we have demonstrated that the types of voting are quite similar, what are the tradeoffs in allowing this bias in the system?

### Cons:

1. The initial voting on the article can be very influential as to whether those small number of people browsing your article ever even read it in the first place. This is where these modifications to the `new` section will be helpful.

2. Well that's about it(?)

### Pros:


1. The system is actually **helping** the users by filtering out the bad articles.

2. If the article has a very high score it also encourages the reader to go ahead and read it even if its outside of his usual areas of interest. This is good for a narrowly focused guy like me!

3. In comments, there is a big need for the user that doesn't know *everything* to be able to distinguish informative or insightful comments from garbage without someone having to comment on everything. It lets users just downmod flamebait articles without having to fan the flames by replying. (Oh, and while we're on this, reddit guys, please don't ever add an extra funny rating to comments. This is what has caused ./ to go to total trash much of the time..)

## So:

&gt; Why show points to anyone but the submitter? We have the ability to block low scoring items. That should be enough. The same for comment scores.

See `pro's` above for articles. *Definitely* see `pros` for comments. Heck, even osnews has ratings on comments now. Who would've thought!

&gt; Or is reddit the present day Coliseum? I guess that's it. We like to ""see em"" live or die in real time.

Actually, I don't like seeing many of the articles that die in the `new` section do so. I turned my threshold down to -6 the other day just so I could catc those articles that overeager submitters downrated just to make their submissions stand out.

I am currently ramping up to building some applications/sites who's cornerstone is in effectively using new types of rating systems (primarily #1 and #5) in new ways. Creating an effective interface actually seems to be a large part of the problem! Understanding how people will use the system is the rest of the problem.

How does everyone else use reddit?

The proposition that one could win $15 million allows that person to think about what they could do with all that money, and that's why one spends the dollar for a ticket.

Just as you can eat a healthy meal for $3, as ansible mentions, you may not get the pleasure out of it as you would a nice piece of candy.  Sure the middle-class can afford a candy bar every day, but I remember something in my freshmen college econimics about the law of diminishing returns, reasoning that to the poor person - who doesn't eat a candy bar everyday out of financial inability - would enjoy the candy much more than the (relative) wealthy.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I have no references, but I can offer you some reasoning.

In general, physical processes always converge to local minima of potential energy, because the system moves roughly in the direction of the force, which is nothing but the gradient of potential energy. Thus, nature is applying gradient descent optimization, which can only converge to a local minimum.

Put another way, at a local minimum of potential, there is no force, therefore the system will remain in that state and not seek out the global optimum. Of course, I am speaking only of equilibrium and ignoring things like momentum which anyway must dissipate for the system to reach a steady state. That's why your coffee stays in your cup, a local minimum of gravitational potential, rather than climbing up and spilling out, which would reduce its potential energy greatly.

"reddit.com","t5_6","No...because nobody ever said the utility function has to be continuous.  For many people, $1 vs. $0 is a wash.  They ain't using that dollar anyway, so they don't lose anything by spending it.  But a million dollars means a material change in their lifestyle.  Their thinking is ""Well, I'll be poor whether I pay the lottery tax or not, but if I do, I have a one in a million chance of being rich"".  The dollar amount doesn't matter; the poor/rich dichotomy does.

Of course, this brings up a whole bunch of other issues about people not being able to aggregate risk or see the value of building up small changes over a lifetime.  However, even factoring those in, it could still be rational to play the lottery.  Say that you start investing $1/day at 12% returns, fairly typical stock market values.  After 50 years, you will have over $1 million.  However, you'll also be *old*!  What good is $1 million after you've wasted 50 years of prime spending time earning it?

Cleverness lies in understanding the real relationships that different problems have, and the real differences between them, not in adopting a pose that erases those relationships and differences.

"reddit.com","t5_6","[deleted]",1142294042
"reddit.com","t5_6","This article botches several key points

1) ""I would never be able to get a million dollars, but I have a dollar in my pocket."" Hey, investors can do math as well as you can. If you have a plan that truly has a 16% chance of a 25x payoff, you'll be able to get an investor pool together that has a million dollars *particularly* if you get to play the game repeatedly as many times as you like. The spectre of ""crushing debt"" is just silly. The value of the ""enterprise"" of playing the game would be exactly the expected net present value, no more, no less. You should be able to sell that enterprise for just about what it is worth. 

2) ""Utility of a dollar."" There is no such thing, except for strange people who like George Washington's portrait on a greenback. The utility is for *all possible other uses of that dollar.* Including buying formula for the baby, that candy bar, or whatever. 

All of these are sure things, and they are all worth very close to a dollar, unless you can think of nothing else you buy other than lottery tickets. 

The pleasure of fantasizing about the lottery is probably most of the payoff, and the disappointment of not actually winning is probably underweighted. 

People almost certainly get positive utility from crack use, but would we really want our goverments to sell crack to support government activities? Are poor people perhaps not stupid to use crack?

He's also very sloppy about the $10,000 payoff for a penny. Rounding one cent to ""zero utility"" is just silly.

3) ""Insurance is just like the lottery."" This is a misleading analogy. I can't really avoid the risk of fire or flood or other loss that could affect my house. I don't necessarily have the *liquid reserves* to replace my house if it burns down. The fire insurance is weighing a small predictable loss of utility against a large unpredictable loss of utility.

That would be the ideal model, to me. A page you're already on could have a donation cost associated with it. All you have to do to pay it is click a little up-arrow in your browser toolbar. The cost would be visible right next to the arrow. One click, you're done. This would be something you'd get used to doing hundreds of times a day - just like Digging, except it would cost a quarter of a cent or a cent or even two or three cents.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; ""Clearly defined development processes"" are an MBA's way of disguising hacking because he's afraid of calling it hacking.

Hacking is more difficult in a team, especially when you are working on an existing product. It is awesome for 1-3 developers, but beyond that you *need* coordination to keep people from wasting each others time? *That* is clearly defined development process, and it is, if anything, designed to try and scale the positive benefits of hacking to groups large enough to handle the task.*

&gt; No. I think hackers should learn how to hack, and then get hired because they're good hackers. If you have good hackers in your company, they will hack good code their own way,

Yeah, I *really* want to hear that my bank employs a bunch of self-trained hackers to churn out code ""their own way"". That advice, again, is great for small groups on fresh projects in specific problem domains. If you are getting this from paul graham he even dileberately puts in caveats about these cases. Regardless in order to bring in new people on a project they have to know the tools involved to not be a burden. Self training is awesome at teaching you how to use the tools for what you want to do, which is not a problem provided the company you go to work for uses the same tools in exactly the same way.

&gt;You learn how to hack on your own time because you love it, and maybe you learn some new languages or tools on the job, but if you're a reasonably competent person, you should be able to just learn those on the fly without using ""training material and courses.""

So a company is supposed to just let you sit around and try to learn it? How many people have you known that would not have that kind of motivation. So far it has proved patently *impossible* to hire someone and know you can trust them to do all their learning on their own AND know they have learned everything they need to. What is wrong with providing resources to help learn? 

*Yes, I have read all the books about the disadvantages of adding more programmers. They are awesome books, and make for really great quotes. They also say that the concept should not be taken to extremes. At the end of the day no matter how great everything else is, you still have an X amount of people = Y amount of work equation.

Another comparison: How many people use per minute cell phone plans? Very few. Either that or they are dead set on using it as one (only using it on nights or weekends.) People will pay more just so they have the flexibility to not have to be watching the clock. Or in this case watching how many pages they click on.

Everyone was happy to turn this article into whatever hobby horse they happened to want to ride, regardless of its suitability for that purpose.  For example, people who wanted to argue that lotteries are stupid read into it an argument that lotteries are not stupid, and then argued that point with the article.  But the article has nothing to say on that subject.

From my point of view, it is as if a hundred strangers showed up in my email saying ""Of all the arguments I have ever heard that purport to prove that boiled galoshes are good for growing puppies, yours is the stupidest"" and ""The suitability or non-suitability of mangel-wurzels for cultivation in the Andes is not going to be clarified by this article's haphazard logic.""  Fine, but those are not defects in the article, since it was not written with the intention of discussing galoshes or puppies or mangel-wurzels, and does not say anything about them.  The article has many defects, but its failure to present a cogent argument about mangel-wurzels is not one of them.   And its failure to cogently address the issue of the stupidity or non-stupidity of poor people playing the lottery is not one of its defects either, since it does not address that subject and was never intended to.

The article was essentially in two parts.  One part discussed a particular argument against lotteries, an argument which focuses on the expected value to the exclusion of everything else, and refuted this *single* argument.    A refutation of a fallacious argument against lotteries is not, itself, an argument in favor of lotteries, and I did not intend it as such.

The other part of the article was a series of potentially interesting non sequiturs on the subject of risk. The paragraph about catstrophic meteor strikes was of this type.  These non sequiturs were not intended to form any argument for or against any premise whatsoever.  That did not stop dozens of people from imagining that these non sequiturs formed a part of whatever argument they happened to want to have.

At this time I wrote the article, I thought it was by far the weakest one on my web site, and I seriously considered throwing it away.  I am somewhat ashamed of having posted it.   But I would be much more ashamed to be one of the many, many people who invented some argument out of thin air, attributed that argument to the article, and then criticized the article for making (or failing to effectively make) the argument that they themselves invented.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I find the comparison in the article between the file sharing networks and libraries interesting. Currently we are living in the country where we cannot have TV reception by any means (we're house-sitting, so can't install satellite etc). So, we've been getting a lot of DVD movies from the local library to watch. It's surprising, they actually have many very recent titles. I am always struck wondering whether public libraries could ever be started in this day and age if they didn't already exist from times gone by. I think not - can you imagine the MPAA and RIAA standing by while a publicly funded institution allowed people to just check out movies and books without payment? Unthinkable. The only reason it's tolerated is because it's an existing institution, from before all this madness began. A small ray of sunshine from an earlier age of more reason, perhaps.

I am all in favor of the copyright holders getting paid for their work but... is it worth squashing everybody else's rights in the process? Maybe if they didn't make quite so much money for movies then some of the actors wouldn't be paid such insane salaries. Maybe $20 million to star in a movie is too much money to pay someone.

In any case, remember how the MPAA tried to squash VCRs when they first appeared? They ranted about how this would destroy their business since everybody would be pirating and copying away. But look today - video sales and rentals are their biggest earner. I wish they could have a little more imagination about how to use the online potential, rather than trying to put more and more limitations on us. I can't even fast-forward through the FBI warning on DVDs any more, so I have small hope for what kinds of future draconian measures they will be putting in place if they have half a chance. They want to stop us from making more than one copy of a song, I say enough is enough. On the one hand they say you don't own the song or the movie but rather merely a license to play it under certain circumstances... but then I see a movie poster trumpeting ""own it on DVD next Monday"".

Indeed, such a programming style really needs support from a type checker (that's why Lisp is bad at handling it); ML sacrifices a couple of important things (most importantly function overloading) to be able to do type inference rather than just type checking: it guesses the types, and checks their consistency. It could be that Qi's type system requires too much type annotations, and thus makes the program kludgy and verbose.

I've discussed this with faculty and the older ones have a really strong 'less publications of better quality' and the younger ones have a 'everything that contributes to my c.v., even in a small way, is good' mentality. Sure, I'm blatantly generalizing, but at least in the earth sciences there has been a huge decline in quality accompanied by a huge increase in the number of journals. Of course, there is a corresponding request-for-papers-for-midlevel-journals trend too, because they need to keep those journals full.

Journal publications are explicitly ranked by search committees for positions, and by grant committees. Everyone knows what the first-rank, second-rank, and not-so-good journals are in a field. Sure, some great papers show up in the not-so-good journals. The converse is even more true - a lot of 'same old, same old' conservative papers show up in the second rank journals. 

I agree with some of the earlier comments that there is a 'old boys' network phenomenon here, though I would argue that it is an 'old comfortable ideas' phenomenon - people want to be challenged a bit, not a lot, and they certainly don't want papers out that cast their _own_ historic papers into questionable light. And this WILL happen - new research will make perfectly honest 'old' research either 'irrelevant' or 'invalid in new context.' So there is a social bias against really revolutionary work. 

I think that science (not science journals, not editors of science journals, not...) would be well served if everyone was told 'okay, you can only submit two articles for peer review per year as first author, and two more as anything OTHER than first author.' Before you scream that these numbers are too low, remember that most of the famous scientists historically didn't submit ANYWHERE NEAR this number and remember as well that spending ten hours on a project perhaps shouldn't result in being listed as an author (even fifth...). And yes, these rules are the rules I apply to myself. And I have no shortage of research grants.... etc... so obviously it wasn't a 'fatal decision' to make.

I spend a fair amount of time doing peer reviews and doing grant selection work and I can honestly say that 75% of what I see is not a credit to those who did the work. I've gotten harsher in recent months because the flow of sewage is increasing. Sigh.

Sure, all the system applets like Notepad could use it but we're not going to rewrite that code.""

Even well-meaning liberals in government support policies like minimum-wage laws, zoning laws, work regulations, victim disarmament, welfare, etc.  All of these policies, while they look good at first glance, are harmful to the very groups they try to help.

I don't doubt the heart of the modern liberal.  But every government intervention has negative effects that more than offset any positives.  Minimum wage laws are effectively price controls for labor, discouraging the formation of many temporary jobs that would provide valuable work experience to immigrants and other disadvantaged.  It is usually the poor who buy guns to protect themselves, while the rich live in gated and guarded communities.  Guns are used to prevent millions of crimes every year, but such events are not very newsworthy since usually a shot is never fired.

The biggest thing I think he is missing is the concept of ""the right tool for the job"". No single tool fits every task perfectly, and very few tools are suited to only one task. ""Spokespersons"" for every tool vendor have this problem.

I work in a world that is primarily MSSQL/ASP/.NET/VB/C#. That is my bread-and-butter. However, there are tasks I have that are not well suited to tools in that list. I use Python for an important group of admin-automation processes. These could be done with VB/C#, but from an efficiency standpoint (how efficiently I can get the information to it's destination), Python often gets me there quicker. For others, Python in this sense could be replaced with Perl, Ruby, etc.

That's where a Christian would disagree with you.  In the biblical worldview, there is a judgement day where you will be held accountable for your deeds on this earth.  You'll be judged for the person you are.  

Only it's not a ""I'm 50% good, go to heaven"" kind of thing.  It's not a ""I was 99.9999999% good, I get to go to heaven"" kind of thing.  You're not judged against other people.  You're judged against God himself.  And you fall short.  We all do.

God has to judge us because he is just, and he's already judged Satan for his disobedience.  Satan (our accuser) stands there and is like: ""Hey God, I disobeyed you and I'm going to be cast in the lake of fire to burn forever.  Look at Adam.  He disobeyed you too.  Stick him there too.""  And that's a valid argument, and God is like: ""You know what, you're right.  He did disobey me, just like you.""

The ""Good News"" (known back in the day as the 'gospel') is that God provided us with a way out of this rather hopeless situation.  He provided his only Son as a sacrifice for you and for me, that by his blood and the loss of his life we might justified (or 'made right') in his sight.  Jesus is the Lamb of God; he is our Scapegoat - he is our sacrifice.

So do you need someone standing between you and God?  You sure do.  You need to be covered in the blood of the Lamb.  You need Jesus sticking up for you on that day when God judges the secret lives of men.  If you reject him in this life, he's not going to stick up for you.  And without him, you're going to suffer the same fate as Satan.

This is the Biblical worldview.  And it sounds stupid to you.  It used to sound stupid to me.  I used to mock Christians.  Now I am one.  Go figure!

"reddit.com","t5_6","reddit, hard to spell?

Steve and I were having dinner one night (unfortunately, his girlfriend had to bear witness to this spectacle) and we were discussing the name.  I was still adament about calling it reddit despite the terrible spelling.  In fact, I was so enamored by the name that I was *sure* it wasn't nearly as difficult to spell as Steve (&amp; Paul) made it out to be.  Our debate suddenly reached its climax.

""Steve, I bet you 5 bucks that 1 out of 10 random people would guess that a website called ""read it dot com"" would be spelled reddit.com.""

He took me up on it.  But I wasn't done, 10% was too easy.  I insisted that 2 out of the 10 would answer correctly.

Steve accepted this offer with a sly chuckle.  I would learn to fear this chuckle.

We stormed out of the restaurant looking for [in]competent-looking spellers. I was so confident that I let Steve not only ask the question (as if I would have pulled some Jedi mindtricks or something), but choose whom he would ask.

We approached the first person, a girl in her late teens (in hindsight this does seem rather odd, going up to a random person on the street and asking them how to spell something, but then again, this is Cambridge we're talking about).
""Excuse me, how would you spell reddit, as in, reddit.com?""

She hesitated for a moment before answering ""r-e-d-d-i-t.""

I cheered, perhaps excessively, and even danced a tiny jig, but my point had been made, not only that, but on the first try (that, and I'm apparently not a very gracious winner).  The only problem was that I'd upped the anty by boasting a magnificent 2 out of 10 people would guess correctly.

Hubris is a tragic flaw indeed.

The next 15 or so people (Steve insisted on continuing the survey well beyond the necessary sample size) all said the same thing... ""r-e-a-d-i-t.""

A friend of mine on a label reliably reports that they get frequent requests from artists to do something about their tracks being given away for free 'on the internets' and that the labels are therefore obliged to be seen to be doing something (given that their job is to generate as much money as possible from the artists' music).

Sure, I mean... communists. But who in our current political landscape is Graham arguing with? People advocate the elimination of **poverty**, but that's not the same thing.

It also does not entail a reduction of economic inequality. I suspect his real problem is with progressive taxation, but if he wanted to make that specific an argument he'd just be parroting every simpleminded libertarian.

Your statement will show one row for every address_book, not ONLY the first child address for each name record.  In my case I don’t want duplicate names.  I know you can by pass that limitation by using DISTINCT and GROUP BY. 

However if you are doing some a custom querying reporting system, one where you allow user to define their own column types, it requires a lot SQL meta programming. In that case it is more convenient to encapsulate each column with a subselect instead of using Distinct and Group By in the end.  


The second example is very common when you need to find the max (or average or mean ) value of subset of records within the current table.

An absurd one.

And even ignoring its absurdity, it's also totally wrong.  Way wrong.  Incredibly wrong.  

In the 2004 election, even if 100% of California's and New York's votes went to a single candidate, he would somehow had to have garnered over forty percent of the voters in the other 48 states.  The other 48 states that he pledged to bankrupt.

So what are you going to suggest next? 

That a candidate can promise to bankrupt all states except California, Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, and North Carolina, and if he wins 100% of the vote in those states, he would win the whole election?

Is that what you want me to admit?

Your big ""GOTCHA!""?

Okay.  I admit that if:

1. The election of the President of the United States was by popular vote, and

2. A candidate promised to bankrupt all states except California, Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, and North Carolina, in order to enrich the coffers of those states, and

3. He wins 100% of the vote in those states,

then he would win the election.

You got me.  Congratulations.

Oh, but by the way, if we instead keep the Electoral College, add Massachussets into that list of states, and now he only has to win 51% of each of those states, instead of 100%.

So yes, I concur, you win: The Electoral College is the only thing keeping us from the Tyranny of California, Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, and North Carolina.

The resulting steam pressure forces the piston down in a second power stroke (the fifth stroke) and the steam is ejected as the piston rises again (the sixth stroke). 

So overall it's suck-squish-bang-blow-sizzle-blow. It seems like this could recover a bit more energy (the exhaust is cooler) from the fuel, and potentially lower NOx emissions and reduce knock and ping for a given fuel grade. The downside, of course, is you need to carry a tank of distilled water around.

"request","t5_21nj","There's a definite intersection betwween technical geeks and legal geeks - probably thanks to the rise of interest among developers caused by the GPL, EULAs, SCO vs. IBM, and related software licensing issues.

For me, this interest in the intersection of technology and the legal profession has expanded into other areas.  I find myself fascinated not so much with the law; I'm more interested in those areas where the law breaks down - the ""bugs"" in the legal system, the bizzare corners where cases make you chuckle, frown or just go ""What were these guys smoking?""

I suspect that there is a segment of the reddit population that would be interested in these types of submissions.

The problem is that these types of submissions tend to fare poorly on the main reddit site.  There is apparently a large segment of the reddit population that apparently thinks that if a submission isn't about lisp, python, startups, politics or religion, then it's ""uninteresting"".  So whether one of these submissions lives or dies is a crap shoot - it depends almost entirely on the initial reaction of the first person to see the link.

A subreddit for these types of articles would remove some clutter from the main submission queue, and allow articles on a slightly less-popular topic (the law/legal profession) to exist where they are judged on their own merits and within their own realm, instead of having to be subjected to the tyranny of the majority on the main reddit site.

Know the basic claims of the religion that you claim to be a believer in.

I never cease to be amazed at the number of True Believers in, say, Christianity who have no idea what I'm talking about when I ask them their opinions on certain specific parts of the Bible.  Often they don't even believe me that the Bible contains such passages - they conflict too heavily with the vapid ""God's just this super nice guy"" version of Christianity that is extremely popular today.

I have had people actually come to my door unsolicited, trying to convert me, who have left *shocked* at some of the verses that I pointed out to them.  That's just unfathomable to me: If I actually believed that the Bible was the word of the creator of the universe, you could be damn sure that I would know it word for word, backwards and forwards.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Dont bother with the article. I'll sum up how not to embarrass yourself. Dont try to prove that god exists. It will never work.

You're right, but not for the reason you think.

First of all, you generally cannot ""prove"" or ""disprove"" the existence of anything outside of the realm of abstract mathematics. Science doesn't work on proof and disproof, because the universe is just too messy to allow that. However, things can be strongly supported or contradicted by physical evidence, so we can use this as a weak definition of ""proof/disproof"".

But given this definition, you still can't prove (or disprove!) that God exists, because God, by definition, is an omnipotent, supernatural entity, not bound by the laws of the known universe. And any proof or disproof of the existence of something must depend on those laws.

Trying to use science to prove or disprove the existence of God is like trying to use the rules of Monopoly to argue that you've won a game of Scrabble. It's just ridiculous.

Perhaps the biggest argument against multiple links from a single site is that it encourages patent-like behavior, with one user trying to put his stakes on new ground before anybody else.

You never really plan on selling it for that much, and you're making a tidy profit even if it gets haggled down by some huge percentage.  You risk sticker-shocking people away for the reward of occasionally finding a buyer who doesn't care and/or is just a complete sucker and will pay the ridiculous starting price.  But even the buyer who haggles you down to a price that gives you 1000% profit is a sucker if they think they're getting some tremendous deal - and hagglers often do think this.

It sounds like the author understands they're paying way too much, but they still paid it, and it sounds like they would have paid it even if they weren't experimenting with haggling.  From the seller's perspective it shouldn't matter.  What may matter to them is if word of this gets out and they suddenly have to haggle like this with buyers who previously would've settled on the initial price or at least wouldn't have taken the haggling this far.  Then you run the risk of losing sales if you don't repeat this performance, but you're not getting as much profit as you could have if your potential buyers didn't have this information about what kind of pricing you're willing to agree to if pushed far enough.

All of the cases he listed are cases where abstractions failed because their underlying components failed. I don't see how this relates to the concept of learning how to understand things at a conceptually low level while working on them at a conceptually high level.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Let me summarize that article so you don't have to waste time reading it:

---

If the inner workings of an abstraction break in an unhandled way, the abstraction can break.

---

Joel calls this ""leaky"", I call it Life 101.  It's a very long winded set of observations that most people would make through common sense.

Any and every part of a process is prone to error: the inner workings, the abstraction layer, EVERYTHING.  Creating a ""water-tight"" abstraction is impossible, because it requires that either the inner workings be perfect and never generate an error, or that the abstraction layer itself be perfect and be able to handle every conceivable situation.  (And implicitly that the hardware implementing said workings and abstractions never make a mistake.)

There is no such thing as a solid foundation: not in hardware, not in software, not in physical existence.  The best we can do is build things that can handle what can be reasonably expected to occur.  (To the extent that it's even necessary, cost-effective or desirable to do so.)

But I wasn't kidding. Perhaps *indentation sensitivity* is a better euphe^H^H^H^H^Hterm. The idea isn't to force you to use indentation instead of bracketing in all cases (as Python does) but to eliminate the redundancy between the parens that do get indented out and the pretty-printing. So the code looks a damn sight more attractive (at least to those who aren't hardened Lispers), and the danger of wrongly-indented code is elminated (it's a single-point-of-truth thing), while you can still do one-line lambdas and so on.

It's possible to bring it in without too much disruption (or coercion) too. One could easily extend [SRFI 22](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-22/srfi-22.html) to allow an optional second header line to indicate a non-standard syntax. Then significant-indentation source files can be automatically detected by their header and trivially transformed into an all-parens form, and *vice versa*.

"reddit.com","t5_6","More specifically, here are some stuff I love with Qi. 

The cristal-clear syntax: still directly lisp flavoured, but lots of useless parentheses have disappeared; lists-as-data syntax is also a real improvement.

Its functional flavour: common lisp is just not functional enough to my taste (scheme does a better job at this). 


Most importantly, it embraces the ML programming style. In a nutshell, ML style is all about algebraic datatypes: working not only with cartesian products (aka structs/lists), but also sum types (aka unions). To do this properly, you need proper sum types, which means:

* labelled ones: there is a tag safely indicating what kind of data is actually contained in an union.

* proper deconstruction, by pattern matching: that's a safe and efficient way to access the content of a sum type. Basically, it means providing a glorified switch() {...} construct, which offers one case per possible tag in a given sum type; each case is associated with the corresponding code, and in this code, variables are bound to the actual content of the union. Moreover, complex pattern matchings, which test several, possibly nested sum types at once, with guard conditions etc. are easily compiled into atomic, switch-style ones.

* a type system. What's really cool with ML is that you can shift a lot of your problem's complexity from the algorithm to the data structures. That makes sense because the type system is way easier to debug... partly thanks to type checking: making sure you don't unwillingly mix union tags from different union types, and that pattern matchings are consistent and exhaustive. That's probably the main reason why lisp practically failed to embrace ML: in ML, type system is your friend, and not a psychorigid moron cleric, as in many languages...

There is a symmetry between product types and sum types, and most problems which feel unelegant with products become natural with sums (and reciprocally). Look at their symmetrical behaviors:

Products:
&gt; product type:
&gt;
&gt; foo: struct { a : int; b : char ... }
&gt; 
&gt; product constructor:
&gt;
&gt; foo { a = 1; b = 'K'...}
&gt; 
&gt; product accessors:
&gt;
&gt; foo.a, foo.b...

Unions:
&gt; union type:
&gt;
&gt; foo: union { a : int; b : char ... }
&gt; 
&gt; union constructors:
&gt;
&gt; foo.a = 1; foo.b = 'K'...
&gt; 
&gt; union accessor:
&gt;
&gt; foo(X) {
&gt;
&gt;    a -&gt; do-something-with-int(X);
&gt;
&gt;    b -&gt; do-something-with-char(X) ... }

Once you've tasted both halves of the symmetry, you really miss it when you're deprived from half of it. I'm a lisp fan, esp. of its meta-programming capacities, yet I often prefer to work with ML, because given the tough exclusive choice, I prefer alg. datatypes over macros. Now Qi offers both, and static type-checking is made optionnal in it, which means that you don't have to bear it when it'd be of little help.",1142692015

That's the usual answer of the lisp community when you talk about such-and-such not or badly supported feature: ""yeah but that could be done with a couple of macros"". What matters is: it could be done, yet it isn't. 

Frameworks of some importance are difficult and costly to implement; such an important change as static analysis of parts of the program is a huge paradygm shift, it alters the whole development process; and it's not worth it for me, nor anyone else, to develop a cheap knock-off of it, just adequate for a single project I need to achieve within real world constraints.

I agree with lisp zealots that lisp has all it takes to (re)take over the programming world; the problem is probably more of a social one: a community which is perceived as arrogant from outside, which brags a lot about what it could do, and eventualy does little (if you except cool-yet-hardly-usable proofs of concepts). Sure, lisp _could_ have invented Ruby on Rails, and could even have done it much better; but what matters is that rubyists did, and lispers didn't.

A sample size of one isn't that impressive, which he should know with his newly developed statistics prowess.

I think the most important point (i.e. one of the ones I agree with, ha!) is that it is important to motivate students to learn something, and to engage their intuition. I remember learning vector calculus, and finding it difficult, and then learning the physics (electromagnetism) that gave birth to the math, and suddenly understanding it all (okay, sadly not all, but much more!). 

Perhaps it's another a bad generalization, but I think people learn much better when they can imagine what's happening and apply their intuition, rather than just pushing symbols around (which is also interesting later, in computer science).

What I personally like about funky math is it seems to stretch my brain in whole new ways, and I end up coming out with a better understanding of how the whole universe fits together. And when you see concepts from different areas coming together (linear algebra for multi-variable calculus, tensors of inertia looking like covariance matrices from statistics) it's pretty cool.

And yes, I can do long division on paper. Hell, I can take a square root, but I'm a geek who likes math (and uses it daily, in my programming work -- mainly 3D stuff). I'm also lucky in that I'm good at it, and had a number of good teachers.

I say it's the latter perspective that's a win-win for the USA.

I understand that there are whole towns in the midwest that are now revitalized because they have an ethanol distillery pumping up the economy.  That's jobs and Dollars that stay in the US.  

The Japanese beat us with hybrid cars, but it sounds like Ford and GM are winning in the ethanol race.

After all, the whole point of a plain-text file format is to make your data usable to humans with basic, non-specialised tools, yes? Also, the redundancy between pretty-printing and superfluous parens represents duplicated data, which is something to avoid in your underlying data format.

(Warning: will load Java.)

1898 - 1986)

1898'de Mısır'ın Kahire şehrinde doğan İhap Hulusi, ilk ve orta tahsilini Kahire' nin İngiliz okullarında yaptı. 1920 yılında resim eğitimi görmek üzere Almanya'ya gitti. Önce Münih'de Heimann Schule atölyesinde üç yıl çalıştı, daha sonra Kuntsgewerbe Schule'ye devam ederek tahsilini tamamlayıp yurda döndü. Arapça, Almanca, İngilizce ve Fransızca bilmesi nedeniyle Dışişleri Bakanlığı'nda çalışması istendi, ancak o memuriyeti reddetti. Akbaba'da Münif Fehim ve Ramiz'le birlikte çalıştı. Daha sonraları afiş çalışmalarına ağırlık veren İhap Hulusi, afişi yaparken ""Buluş""un önemine değinerek ""Seyredenlerin ilgisini çekmeli ve düşündürmeli"" diye yorumladı.

1929'da İstanbul'da ilk atölyesini kurduktan sonra Kulüp Rakısı etiketi ve Atatürk'ün siparişi üzerine Türk alfabesinin kapağını tasarlayan İhap Hulusi, Ziraat Bankası, İş Bankası, Yapı ve Kredi, Garanti, Sümerbank, Emlak Kredi, Türk Ticaret Bankası, Maliye Bakanlığı(tahviller), Türk Hava Kurumu, Kızılay, Yeşilay, Tariş, Zirai Donatım Kurumu ve birçok özel kuruluşa çeşitli çalışmalarıyla hizmet verdi.

Tayyare Piyangosu (bugünkü adıyla Milli Piyango) idaresi için 45, Tekel İdaresi için 35 yıl çalışan İhap Hulusi, bu süreçte yurtdışında da adını duyurdu. Bayer'in afiş ve etiketleri, Mısır'ın Tekel İdaresi, Devlet Demir Yolları ve şehir hatlarına ait ve ilanları, ünlü İngiliz viskisi John Haigh'ın, İtalyanların Cinzano ve Fernet Branca'sının afiş ve etiketleri İhap Hulusi tarafından yapıldı.

Suluboya çalışmalarının yanı sıra, son yıllarında hat sanatını modernize ederek başarılı örnekler veren İhap Hulusi Görey, 27 Mart 1986'da İstanbul'da hayata gözlerini yumdu.",1142778542

Religions that are thousands of years old, and that have quite literally molded the society that we live in today (a confluence of religions) have incredible importance even if the foundations are completely fictitious. From that perspective it doesn't matter if Jesus was God's son, or Mohammad was a prophet, the result is that the world we live in today is ENORMOUSLY influenced by it. Thousands of years ago man wanted answers, and lacking scientific means, arguably they sometimes resorted to inventing explanations (e.g. Creating God in Man's image), and everyone was happy.

If, on the other hand, in the modern era with all we've learned and know, a science fiction writer (I'm not, err, talking about any ""religion"" in particular) imagines up a pretty far fetched story, remarkably correlating with his line of fiction, then it should be debunked and discarded. Showing disdain for something with such a lack of history, and a lack of any credibility at all, is a completely healthy response.

It's a completely self-centered religion - a quest to free yourself from some kind of spirits inside your body(?). I could be wrong though.

&gt;The space planes were exact copies of Douglas DC-8s, ""except the DC-8 had fans, propellers on it and the space plane didn't.""

The proposed main page design:

  * Improves the prominence of the portal links.
  * Clearly divides the header's article navigation links and project-related links.
  * Includes both the ""Picture of the day"" and ""Did you know..."" on the main page, seven days a week.
  * Adds a section containing descriptions of Wikipedia's important non-article areas.
  * Swaps the positions of ""Did you know..."" and ""Selected anniversaries"" (renamed ""On this day...""), thereby establishing a left-hand column that highlights our most polished articles and our newest articles (which hopefully will receive similar treatment), along with a right-hand column that highlights current news stories and news stories from years past.
  * Swaps the positions of the links to our sister projects and the links to other languages' Wikipedias, thereby eliminating the need to use extra-small text for the latter.
  * Aims to improve the page's aesthetic appearance.

I have numerous friends; my typical Saturday night involves smoking, drinking and bullshitting until dawn.  Yet the entirety of my internal world is an inexpressible mess of tactile, visual, and sometimes auditory sensations which only form themselves in language at the moment they are transcribed into tangible symbols for others to experience.

What's more, this was a world that I distinctly remember entering into after I became frustrations with the limitations of language as a foundation for thought.  When I was young, I thought almost entirely in words.  I began to drift away from word-based thought because language is cumbersome.  It's lumpy and static, where thought is much more liquid and wave-like.  I'm of the opinion that language is at best a method of approximating and communicating the complexity that lies behind what I'm really thinking and feeling.

Responding to the argument of this piece: If I don't think in words, why am I not retarded, at least in a social sense?    

Perhaps he's right in the more limited sense that exposure to language is a beneficial step in teaching us of the existence of abstract thought.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I actually took Pinker's class last year.  In my opinion, he's stuck on a proof of concept (that language *really does* affect thinking) which has led him into some dead ends.  He's getting old enough that this kind of a thing is inevitable  (Ever read Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions* ?).

I wrote a paper for the class which addresses this thread directly, only with some contemporary neuro research behind it.  Pinker believes in a modular theory of mind, which means that he thinks that our brains are a set of coevolved functional units (modules), each of which behave very differently on the basis of evolutionary development.  Sight is a module, as is hearing, language, face recognition, dexterity, etc.  

This theory is good in that it further opens the black box of the unconscious mind.  But modular mind theories are ultimately limited in that the highest level of granularity of structure within the brain that they can address is a module.  A better model would actually look at the patterns of neural association in the brain, or within these modules.  Pinker doesn't seem to care about this kind of research, even though it tends to explain many more of the subtleties of our psychology than his (such as priming, now referred to  by psychologists as an general ""effect"").

All this modularity business confounds our understanding of what is actually happening within the mind.  In leads philosophers of mind, who do not even read the neuro research, to say ridiculous things like ""language is the module which unifies all other modules.""  That's great, but how on earth do you support such a claim if it's not by looking at the structure of relationships behind our thinking?

The paper is pretty short, but it has good references if you're interested.  You can read it at http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~garris/Garrison2005_language-thought.pdf

According to your argument the SETI program (Search for Extraterristial Intelligence) is completely useless because there is currently no indication that such life exists. To prove it, we e.g. need to test planets for oxygen or listen for EM transmissions.
You may say that the difference between god and SETI is that the latter can be proven. But there are reasons that ET may very well exist even if it is entirely impossible to prove it. First transgalactic distances may prevent spectral analysis of other planets forever.

Different standards are applied to that kind of software for a good reason.

Every good Muslim practices Jihad. Jihad means to refrain
from actions that corrupt the mind, body and soul as listed 
by Islamic tenets (e.g. murder, theft, fornication, 
adultery, backbitting, greed, envy, jealousy, usury etc). It 
is a struggle against the gluttony of the flesh and the 
material world. This is the Jihad every Muslim is encouraged 
to practice.

The lesser form of Jihad is the Holy War. Holy War as 
described under Islam tenets is a fight in defence of a 
Muslim's life, family, property, fellow Muslim (if they are 
being wrongfully persecuted) and the religion of Islam. 

There are two key important points that need to be emphasized
in the last paragraph. The first is that the fight does __not__
necessarily have to be physical or voilent. The second is that
the fight has to be defensive and __never__ offensive. In 
other words, a Muslim should never be the aggressor.

If, unfortunately, the conflict cannot be resolved 
peacefully there are Islamic rules of engagement that should
be followed. Any action outside the rules are considered
barbaric, criminal and ""unIslamic."" I'll list the ones I 
remember:

1). Women and children, as well as ill, infirm and old 
people should not be attacked.
2). Plants and lower animals should not be harmed.
3). Innocent entities who have nothing to do with the conflict
should neither be attacked or harmed.
4). If the opposing party throws in the towel, the fight
should cease immediately.

In conclusion, Jihad does not mean terrorism. And Jihadists 
(I assume this means Muslims who practice Jihad) are not 
terrorists. Islam forbids terrorism and good Muslims are
disgusted by acts of terrorism. The term ""Islamist Jihadist""
as abused by the authors of this article is an oxymoron.

You're right. I apologize for sounding snotty; things show up here so fast, it's easy to miss them sometimes.

&gt; 2) What if people are driving anyway? i.e. As an addition to current conditions, wouldn't capturing energy that is already being produced (and wasted) and converting it to electricity be a positive?

It would, but this won't do that. Instead, it will increase the amount of work cars have to do (by making them climb over a slight bump) and, consequently, the amount of gas that they burn. That's where the energy to generate electricity will come from.

There *is* a great deal of energy wasted by modern cars -- engine/exhaust heat, braking, etc. -- and someone might come up with ways to capture some of that and use it (not all, of course, thanks to the 2nd law of thermo, but some). In fact, some schemes like this have been explored and/or developed. For example, there is ""regenerative braking"" in electric cars, which slows the car by turning the motor(s) into generator(s), capturing some of the kinetic energy and converting it back into electrical charge. There is also the interesting story of the [six-stroke engine](http://reddit.com/goto?id=03520) that, according to its inventor, recaptures some of the waste heat produced and does useful work with it. These technologies, of course, only focusing on recapturing waste energy to power the individual vehicle, but if adopted on a large enough scale, they would have a significant effect on a nation's energy infrastructure.

But the idea of the electricity-generating speedbumps is just silly. I'm sure the inventor is proud of himself, but I hope that somebody with some basic physics sense is involved in the decision of whether or not to adopt it.",1142828327
"reddit.com","t5_6","Actually, that isn't quite true.  The are more than a few things that might work here.  Back in the 1930s (maybe more recently, not sure), ethanol and methanol were used as anti-freeze.  They can be used in temperatures down to -30F.  The real problem for use as radiator antifreeze is that they evaporate easily, so you have to check the radiator often to make sure they have all evaporated (which would let the water freeze).  If you're using them in a six-stroke, that isn't an issue, since you expect the level to decrease fairly quickly.  The problem then is that the ethanol might burn, which isn't quite what you're intending it to be used for.

That being said, I had heard of a few (Subaru) performance enthusiasts who were putting in a water injection system that would inject water into the cylinder when the fuel went in.  They reported improved power and decreased knock (or rather, that they could increase turbo pressure without getting knocking).  It also was reported to improve emissions.  I've also seen some sites (mostly for motorcycle racing, where water injection seems to be a given) that suggested that adding ethanol (it has different properties than gasoline) to the water improved performance/gallon even further, with the benefit of acting as antifreeze as well.",1142828399

You may not use ridiculous names like ""Pummelchen"" (dumpling), etc. You may not use a company or product name (except of course if the usage as first name predates the usage as company name).

There are three major reasons for Wealth/Poverty: Geography, Infrastructure, and Culture.

Economists disregard culture as a economic artefact because it can't be quantified and its politically incorrect. The reason Economists distrust culture is because it is such a 'one size fits all' argument.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Here's a possible explanation.  Assuming that you have to work for your money and don't get it through inheritance/corruption/lottery, there are two ways that a person can become rich:

a.) They want to become rich, and so decide to work hard and become good at their job.

b.) They love their job and want to change the world, and money is a frequent by-product of that.

People in a.) tend to be conservative, because their goal has always been money, and so they will do whatever it takes to protect the money they've earned.  People in b.) tend to be liberal, because their goal has always been impact, and the money is only a side-effect of that.  If they can trade a little money for a lot more impact, that's a good deal.

b.) is really common among entrepeneurs, because people who start businesses for the money generally don't succeed.  There're too many hurdles, too much risk, and too little immediate payoff for money to be an effective motivator.

Off the top of my head, I can think of several people in category b.): Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin,  John Doerr, Walt Disney.  I don't have detailed info on their political beliefs, but my impression is that they're generally a fair bit more liberal than their corporate CEO counterparts.

It's easy to blame the victim, and it's certainly attractive - after all, if the poverty of poor countries is their own fault, then we certainly shouldn't bother trying to help them, right?  Okay, corruption stunts economic growth.  But it's a very poor predictor of poverty because some of the least corrupt countries in Africa are extremely poor, and some of the most corrupt countries elsewhere are developing quickly.  It's more likely that corruption is caused by poverty - underpaid public servants have an added incentive to take bribes, and an undereducated public does a poor job of monitoring officials to keep them accountable.  Countries are poor for many reasons - they may lack natural resources, or infrastructure, or fertile cropland, or natural seaports - and many of them were systematically robbed of their resources for centuries under European colonialism.  To blame the problem on ""kleptocracy"" is a dangerous fallacy.

That's the whole point - a larger population inevitably leads to net job growth. It's simply naive to think of the job pool as a static resource and therefore needing to be protected from new entrants. You might just as well propose sterilisation as stopping immigration (the fact that nobody does this just goes to show that the real motivation here is xenophobia dressed up as an economic argument). And the logical conclusion of this position is that a declining population is good for the economy which is clearly nonsensical.

&gt; Employers really like this situation - for them there can't be enough immigration. You know that employer and employee are in perpetual state of conflict, right?

That's just typical recruiting propaganda that politicians use to attract people in marginal situations (nominally left-wing parties say this kind of thing as well as the far-right because they are simply telling people what they want to hear). Don't forget that a larger population also means more employers. You might also want to consider that an employer who wants to really drive down labour costs doesn't need immigration to achieve this as they can always outsource - you think it's better for the Danish economy to have those jobs go abroad or stay at home?

&gt; Apart from that, many Polish work here to sustain their family in Poland, so I call crap on the 'fueling the Dutch economy' thing as well.

Instead the author's contention is that the purpose of the invasion was to take Iraqi oil off the market, forcing a supply constriction and increasing the cost of oil.  Allegedly Bush and company did this to reward their buddies in Big Oil and in OPEC.  It's a very different point than what I originally thought.

Nevertheless it's still all hooey.  Look, even if Bush wanted to keep Iraqi oil off the market (I don't believe this but for the sake of argument, let's say it's true), the easy way to do that was to maintain the pre-war sanctions -- even with the Oil-for-Food program in place pre-war Iraqi oil production was a tiny fraction of its potential -- much less than Saudi or Iranian production, and too tiny to have much impact on world oil prices.

It's true that the sanctions were being eroded around the edges.  There was a lot of pressure coming from the Europeans who wanted that oil production back on line and also for humanitarian reasons since the sanctions were clearly hurting the Iraqi people more than they were hurting Saddam Hussein.  However, after September 11th it would have been easy to get the Europeans to fully fall back in line behind the sanctions.  They would, in fact, have bought into just about anything if it could have persuaded the U.S. not to invade Iraq.

I can also guarantee you that the Saudis would much rather have lower oil prices than to have all that chaos going on just beyond their northern border.

However, some of these abstractions are useful for some purposes (e.g. blue helps us describe paints, numbers are good in engineering, etc.) Some of these abstractions aren't useful to us, personally or scientifically (e.g. there is no scientific correlation between praying for something and something happening); though can be useful in sociopsychology (pretending to believe in a sentient higher power apparently makes some other people think we are noble - a good leadership quality).

It's probably a good idea to keep the abstractions in their context and don't try to use them outside their sphere of usefulness. e.g. Don't use blue as a number.",1142945190

"reddit.com","t5_6","A-life simulations, and their consequences, are the main example of what computer science has to offer.  A few simple rules executed in a grid of cells gives rise to complex patterns that evolve as you watch them.

One way in which this might teach us about the universe was if the universe could be described at a low enough level by just such a set of rules, and we discovered what they were.

Another way this can teach us about the universe is by discovering sets of rules that approximately hold in certain situations enough to be useful is describing behavior.

I am neither physicist nor computer scientist enough to take you any further than that.

Another twist on this theme (which goes in the reverse direction: how studying nature can teach us about computation) is that non-linear physical processes can be said to be computing things.  The book ""The Computational Beauty of Nature"" explored this theme in some depth.

This makes some amount of sense when you stop to realize that the lowest level computer components used to build ""computers"" are among the simplest, purely non-linear components possible: switches.  If the input voltage to the device is below a certain level, the output goes low, if it is above a certain level, the input goes high.

One reason non-linear differential equations are so hard to solve short of simulating them is that the processes they describe are doing computations.  If closed form solutions were possible, you could determine the state of the system at some point in the future without having to calculate all of the intermediate states, which means the intermediate states weren't calculating actually anything later states *depended* on.

I honestly don't see your point regarding presidential elections proving some sort of conservative majority. After all, even if I were to accept your claim that it proves anything that republican presidents have served more terms in the last 50 years or so, you yourself point up the fallacy of your argument--Congress. As you say, the Republicans gained a majority in Congress in 1994 during a Democratic president's tenure, but what you don't seem willing to acknowledge is that the Democrats had a solid majority in Congress since 1952... you know, during the reign of all those Republican presidents you giddily name. If conservatives truly were in the majority for all this time, as you claim, it seems rather odd that they held a Congressional majority throughout the tenure of both Republican and Democratic presidents. I would even aver that  such trends are somewhat cyclical, with a clear ebb and flow of conservative and liberal thought, in the face of your baseless claim of an overall conservative dominance. 

[and, as an aside, Nixon is a rather bad example for you, considering he ushered in the most sweeping liberalization of the federal government since FDR; i.e. EPA, et al. He's also a bad example since, you know, he utterly disgraced the office such that, according to Gallup, 51% of the public identified themselves as Democrat and only 21% Republican in 1977: http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=750]

""However, partisan allegiances also change – and over time, they can change a great deal. In the 1960s and 1970s, Democrats enjoyed as much as a two-to-one edge over Republicans in party identification, largely on the strength of the ""big tent"" coalition their party had assembled during the long presidency of Franklin Roosevelt. But by the end of the 1980s, President Reagan had helped to build a modern big-tent Republican Party that wiped out most of the earlier Democratic dominance.

The two parties have been closely matched ever since, with Democrats generally enjoying a small single-digit advantage over the GOP during the past decade and a half – in Pew's July, 2005 survey, for example, 34% of respondents said they were Democrats, 31% Republicans and 29% Independents.""",1142989095

"programming","t5_2fwo","Feh, it exaggerates the appearance of compression by removing empty lines and putting a rule's declarations all on one line. If you do that to the original Reddit stylesheet it comes down to 116 lines.

Anyhow, it's a neat little tool, but not really very great. All it does, as far as I could see, is extract common declarations in different rules and put 'em in a new rule. So if you've been declaring the same `background-colour` for many different elements, say, it'll take all of them out and put them in one place, which is good if you want to change that one colour everywhere.

Any disadvantages, though? Yes, if you've organized your entire stylesheet by the structure of your pages for easier editing, you'll lose all that. And if you want to change several properties of one element, you'll have to go hunting all over the stylesheet for where all its declarations have been scattered. Check this out, it's from the factored Reddit stylesheet:

`#contactlst a, #usermenu a, .little a, .save, .sortbox a, .tablelink, a { text-decoration: none }`  
`#contactlst a, .gray, .little, .menu, .sortbox p.head, .stats td.k { color: gray }`  
`#contactlst a, .info, .little { font-size: x-small }`  
`#contactlst a:hover, .little a:hover, .menu a:hover, .reptable a:hover, .sortbox a:hover, .stats a:hover, :hover.save { text-decoration: underline }`

I encourage you to try and find all the rules that apply to `.sortbox`. It's fun, like a treasure hunt :)

"reddit.com","t5_6","I will agree with schwarzwald and go against this Marvin Minsky, a MIT prof, who is probably a few time smarter than me, a puny third year EE student.

It seems this MIT prof is hell bent on brute forcing his way into AI. 

Computers, as great as they are, are deterministic machines. You take your input, do some fancy algorithms, then spit out an output. Noise is completely undesired. This, as he has admitted, is good for repetitive data manipulations, but has obvious creative limitations.

Biological systems are non-deterministic. They are asymmetric, distributed, noise tolerant systems capable of emergence behavior. More interestingly, they use noise in creative ways to aid survival. 2 examples I can think of are mutation and cellular behavior.

As a simple comparison: Take your most complex multithreaded program (assuming running on a single core). I can read your source code of the program, source code of the scheduling algorithm in the OS and source code of the random number generator library and know exactly which thread will be running at what point at any time. Now, take a Petri dish. Put in a single cell, remove all interference (chemical gradient, directional lighting, etc) and let it grow and divide. You will soon notice that you cells, through with exactly the same genes, will have slightly different phenotypic behavior. That to me blows any program you can ever write out of the water.

Now, I am not familiar with probabilistic AI, but it seems to be yet another fancy algorithm with limited use of noise. So if my assumption holds, you are still building elaborate algorithms on deterministic machines to compete with the complexity of biological systems. So my questions is: Why would you want to program things that will always be dumber than you when you can make systems with emergent behaviors capable of becoming smarter than you.",1143006560

One of the big ongoing issues is the process of a) finding the ball (difficult), b) continuing to know where the ball is (more difficult, since the ball is extremely nondeterministic from the point of view of a small dog with a 170x204 resolution camera in its nose),  c) doing something with the ball, but noticing as soon as possible if the ball is not where you think it is.

"reddit.com","t5_6","My mistake in wording. I was simply trying to stress that the volume, especially from such a small company (a niche player in the hosting business), isn't enough to make them want to step in. Even very large clients in an area with at least a couple of VARs will go through a reseller. Sun typically doesn't undercut their VARs, and directs business to them as much as possible (in fact, you can almost always get better pricing from a VAR than from Sun themselves.)

The only orders that I've seen Sun get directly involved in are many times larger than what such a small company can do, typically strategic alliances and orders that make big tech headlines for Sun. I've seen Sun direct $10MM orders to VARs without blinking.

There seems to be two things here: some people think that Sun should go direct, and some people think that Joyent should have used established sales channels. That argument's been going on for a long time. Each model works for a certain type of business. In the recent past (last several years) Sun has largely concerned itself with very large businesses, the ones that VARs work well with. That may change as (if) they try to compete more with Dell, but the case remains that (whether right or wrong) there is a long established way of doing business with Sun.

That way of doing business worked for years for many companies. It doesn't work for Joyent (and also many others.) It's up to Sun to decide whether the business of small companies is worth the potential losses of undercutting their VARs. Sun usually chooses to not undercut those VARs. That may change in the future, but that's the way they work today. Some thinks it's right. Joyent (and you) apparantly think that it's wrong.

The best thing you can do is vote with your wallet and complain that they're losing your business. In the meantime, I'll happily continue working with my VAR and stress to my Sun rep that I'd hate to see my VAR vanish (and lose the steep discounts and integration support I get--far better than Dell or any other direct company I've worked with) if they ever decide to go predominantly direct.",1143022247

To give an idea of the kind of customization I'm talking about, even though I'm just an intermediate user, I managed to change the behaviour of the basic builtin function ""load"" to suit my needs.

I don't like this, especially since I keep a lot of sources in version control.  Thus I redefined (""advised"") ""load"" to read the most recent file first.

"features","t5_21n6","""In fact, your suggestion of this person [Paul Graham] is totally inappropriate and entirely irrelevant to this subject matter.""

Yes, I understand. I simply mentioned someone like Paul Graham because situations involving people like him contradict what I said previously. That is, most people not liking links being posted to someone's every blog post or writing or site. But in his case, it's ""okay"" since most people seem to think everything he writes is worth reading. See the [top](http://reddit.com/top), Paul Graham's got the 1st, 3rd, 10th, 20th. But, I digress.

I think what is important to note is there are people who want to read everything Paul Graham writes and there are people who could care less who he is. There are people who don't want everyone posting their own blog posts and there are people who don't care and [want to do that themselves](http://www.netawaremedia.com/blog/2006/03/20/). There are [some people](http://reddit.com/info?id=3ea2) that only care about Tech posts and some who don't care.

The problem is, everyone's going to vote up/down things they think are appropriate or not when not everyone has the same opinion on what is appropriate and what they want to see. You end up with a [voting mess](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=27b9) of conflicting opinions, and the majority opinion usually wins.

I think subreddits are trying to help this problem. It's illogical to think that letting everyone try to control one section is going to work because of so many different opinions, likes, and dislikes. So, if there were a subreddit with the specific purpose of letting people plug their tech blog posts, I'm sure that would be cool. People who don't want to read through that stuff don't have to, those who want to post their blog posts can, and others can take a peek at the top ones if they just want to get the cream of the crop. Not necessarly suggesting a subreddit for that, but hopefully you get the idea.

Personally, I think it would be better if users could make their own subreddits, or own sections or ""communities"". Sure, there would be duplicates, and a lot to sort through, but people would gravitate towards the more popular ones and the ones they are interested in. That way you could ignore things that you don't like, or post your own stuff without annoying anyone.

Back to my original idea, though. The worry is reddit getting overrun by people who are simply trying to profit, advertize, and spam because reddit gets a lot of views. Allowing users to penalize users, or at least hide abusive user's links could help make it less worth those people's time, or at least keep their links away from annoying people.

GIF's strong point is the fact that all browsers can handle it. You don't need to install buggy third party plug-ins to view it. Its weak point is that there are no good authoring programs for making nice screencasts. So the quality of most GIF screencasts are usually lower when compared to other formats.

"reddit.com","t5_6","""One of the apparently invincible fallacies of our times is the belief that President Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts caused the federal budget deficits of the 1980s. In reality, the federal government collected more tax revenue in every year of the Reagan administration than had ever been collected in any year of any previous administration. But there is no amount of money that Congress cannot outspend.""

The sums of money Congress spent each year were, on average, within about 0.5% of the spending they approved, but did deviate from Reagan's recommended budgets.  If Reagan wanted to, he could have recommended spending 1 dollar a year, but there would still be financial obligations such as healthcare and unemployment benefits to cover, and it would still be his fault if tax revenue failed to make these ends meet.  Reagans' economic predictions, that such needs would drop drastically as a result of overall income growth, were drastically overoptimistic on this front.  Military overspending was also his direct doing.

It is not surprising that tax revenues continued to grow over the Reagan period, despite torpid growth in it's early years, as overall tax rates imposed on the middle and lower classes were adjusted to compensate.  Note that the article makes no mention of inflation.  Besides, that revenues in each year of the administration exceeded those for all prior is a bald lie.

Your post is full of arrogance. It may as well read, ""I am smarter than you because I don't believe in what you believe in.""

I think that's why a lot of people dislike atheists. Its not the fact that they are atheist as much as it is an elitist attitude that many of them carry which is almost a pity towards other people because other people are ""primitive"" or ""ignorant"" for believing what they do.

Of course never for a second imagining that maybe some people experience something very real and its not just something they've been raised in their entire lives.

And I need to end this post by saying that many people of different religions carry a very elitist attitude as well: only theirs isn't an intellectual elitism, its a moral elitism of the type, ""I'm better than you.""

Its rare to find people who don't have either elitism. But that's not who the character of Christ was: he hung out with the prostitutes and everyone else and in many ways he shunned the religious elite of the day.

There's a lot of pride from both sides of the coin (atheist and religious) that isn't helping anyone at all.

I *hate* discussing religion on Reddit or even viewing the comments on articles that have to do with religion: because every single time I do I know that I'll come across a comment along the lines of, ""Everyone knows Christianity is make-believe.""

Its just lame. I'm not a Christian because I was raised in a Christian household. Before I even became one I did some serious study historically and otherwise, and I don't just carry a blind faith. I have a pretty good idea what I'm talking about when it comes to Christianity, and its frustrating to be dismissed by people who have never even taken the time to study Christianity because they've taken whatever bad experience they had in a church or they've taken all the little nuggets (often incorrect) they've learned over the years and now use them as an excuse to never even honestly consider Christianity.

Yeah, there's a lot of really messed up people that call themselves Christians. There's a lot of people that have done horrible things in the name of Christ. But that doesn't make Christianity true or false because of their actions.

I've honestly considered atheism. I was agnostic for quite some time. I'm just tired of the attitude that is always taken by many atheists where they *know* Christianity isn't real, and yet they've never even given it a chance.

I have seen and experienced things as a Christian which I can only consider miraculous. Yet I know many people would immediately dismiss them because they have a preconceived bias about what is true and what isn't.

Trouble is, you find yourself on the same slope even if you believe in God. Every religion (and every sect within a given religion) has its own moral codes, and who's to say which one is right and which one is wrong?

For that matter, even if you are right (or any theist is) about an all-powerful God that has a certain moral code he/she/it believes in, why is that code right? It's still subjective morality, because it's still an individual's personal opinion; the only difference is that that ""individual"" is an all-powerful being.

The various gospels are not, to put it gently, completely in phase on who jesus was and what he taught.

The most controversial articles are the ones which lots of people vote on but for which there is a lot of disagreement in voting direction.  Uncontroversial articles are liked (or disliked) by everyone.

In the current system, controversial articles would tend not to make to the top of reddit unless there is a majority on one side or the other - a ""maximally"" controversial article which split everyone 50/50 would get a score of 0, and would not be read by anyone.

This would also address a common problem you see with controversial articles - some people vote them up because they think it will promote interesting discussion, others vote it down because they disagree.",1143093634
"reddit.com","t5_6","You can say all you want, but the fact remains...the passage you linked has nothing to do with rape and was from one of the least accurate translations available.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; because every single time I do I know that I'll come across
&gt; a comment along the lines of, ""Everyone knows Christianity 
&gt; is make-believe.""

That's the product of bias and conflation. I'll explain how:

Bias:  a better phrase would be ""Everyone *ought* to know that the *supernatural* is make-believe.""  This does not single out Christians any more than other religions.

Conflation: There's also the conflation of Christianity with ""Christian dogma"".  Even if none of the supernatural stuff applies, Christianity in the form you're defending (i.e. what Jesus said, etc.) has lots of stuff that's hardly make-believe.  Stuff like love your neighbor, and other lessons of compassion, etc., that's self-evident (or at least highly appealing) regardless of the divinity of whoever said it.

So basically, if it takes a god to make people believe in a precept (e.g. ""Suffer not a witch to live"", most of Leviticus, etc.), then it's probably a crappy precept.

If people would willingly accept a precept even without a god attached to it, even if they don't always apply it as well as they should (stuff like the aforementioned Love thy Neighbor), then it's probably an excellent precept.

And if that's how it is, then there can be no case for demanding religious belief of others; only just and compassionate behavior.

It then also follows that there are no grounds for distrusting atheists as a class, and that judging people on their actions (not a bad idea anyway, since even bad men can profess faith) will be a much more effective guide in telling the Jim Bakkers from the Carl Sagans.",1143093703

"reddit.com","t5_6","Great overview of the economics involved. As the article says, NAFTA didn't destroy American jobs. Instead, it destroyed Mexican lives.

* Prior to NAFTA most of Mexico was farmland. They farmed corn, which has been a Central American staple for literally thousands of years, and made good money too.
* This corn was farmed by rural farmers. Here in the United States we make a *lot* of money by harvesting corn with machines, but Mexico is too poor for stuff like that. Import quotas prevented Mexicans from importing cheap American corn.
* NAFTA required Mexico to lift these quotas eventually, and they did so immediately.
* Before they even realized that they needed to switch crops, Mexican farmers were up to their necks in debt.
* Fortunately, Mexico's democratic constitution in 1917 had a provision guaranteeing poor rural farmers land to farm on, called *ejidos*. 
* Unfortunately, NAFTA forced Mexico to amend their constitution to remove this provision.
* Lucky Mexican farmers got to sell their land and work in a factory. Unlucky farmers got their land seized by creditors and became homeless and penniless.
* What sort of factories can you build in Mexico that you can't built right here in the USA? Factories that spew toxic waste, of course. NAFTA's Chapter 11 provision allows companies to sue if the government refuses to let them build toxic waste dumps in a town. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFTA#Chapter_11
* Former Mexican farmers today are living in toxic waste dumps and sending their children to work in factories so they can pay back the debts they owe.

When you look at the numbers, though, everyone made a lot of money off of NAFTA, and since both sides benefited it was a good trade. That's economics.",1143094947
"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; On the other hand, their faith can (and often does) provide strengthening of those core moral principles, even when it isn't the sole basis of them.

This is the common belief, but I honestly don't see any convincing evidence for it. When I look at religious people, I see pretty much the same thing I see when I look at non-religious (or weakly religious) people: human beings who have certain ideas on what is right or wrong, and who (to individually varying degrees) sometimes live up to those ideas and sometimes don't. I really haven't seen anything at all to convince me that belief in a higher power makes a person more likely to resist temptation and moments of weakness.

&gt; Religion also gives many people the support of a community.

This, however, I absolutely agree with. This is the one truly good thing that religion has to offer, IMO. In fact, I'd say that missing out on this is one of the biggest disadvantages of being an atheist. Not that atheists can't have this sort of community -- many do, centered around a variety of different things. But it takes a little more work to find; it doesn't come pre-installed the way that it does for those that grow up in a particular belief system.",1143094955

One: Atheists, suppose you're Christian. As far as you're concerned, a true reference morality exists--God's morality--which is absolute, non-subjective, and non-negotiable. Everything else being equal, meeting two strangers on the road, whom would you trust more to (hold your wallet/look after your young child/etc)? The one who lives by the same absolute standard you acknowledge, or the one who arrives at his own morality via introspection?

Two: jesusphreak, suppose you're an atheist. You believe there is no God; you think the Bible, the Koran, the ancient Greek stories about Zeus, etc are all a mix of history and fiction.  You think logic describes the world, and you're looking for truth. What do you find more compelling? Deductions made beginning with axioms you choose by thoughtful introspection, or morals about the behavior of Zeus and Hera in Mount Olympos?

Summary: 

When a Christian says that you find yourself on a slippery slope once you begin defining individual moralities, he means exactly that--and within its own context, this claim is (logically) correct. 

When an atheist says that introspective morality is just as reliable as biblical morality, he also means exactly that, and within his context, he is also correct.

I.e. Abstraction isn't a silver bullet.

I think this is very important, and relevant. We see hype for Domain Specific Language, and CASE tools, and by realizing the abstraction can/will leak, you can put their worth in perspective.

Of course, some abstractions leak less than others, and this can change over time. A classic example is compiling. Generally, this is a pretty tight abstraction (on mature platforms), but there are sometimes compiler bugs, or more common, times you may need to step into assembly to see what has gone wrong.

"reddit.com","t5_6","It's an enticing argument until you consider the view that economics is no closer to science than scientology is. There have been economic theories of every stripe including Marxist. Their equal vacuousness is not at all obvious until you have seen a few of them come and go. Whichever theory is currently in vogue presents itself impeccably as a very specialised subject understandable only by wonks and beyond simple explanation to a layman (a sure sign that someone is either lying or doesn't fully understand their subject). What these theories have in common is that they are all designed to fit current facts, which makes them very convincing for a while until they fail (and another theory comes along which fits the conditions of the day better). So it's no surprise that they catch on (when they provide such a convenient explanation for things) and nobody wants to look a fool by denying them - so a consensus is easily created this way, especially among economists who fully believe their own propaganda. Unlike science, economic theories never seem to be able to be solidly predictive.

That is good physics, and I'm no physicist.  I do understand that though.  I also got the impression from reading the entry that the ramp itself did not cause much resistence, therefore, didn't necessarily create more work for the car, rather, it reacted to the weight of the vehicle passing over, first compressing, then expanding back into position after the vehicle passes.  As a result, it is the compression (weight) which causes the motion that generates electricity.  Even so, your point is really good.   I'd love to see some testing done to determine if the resistance created by the ramp, and the extra effort caused, was more or less energy than what is produced.  That would be fascinating.

That is a foolish statement.  How can religions be mutually exclusive?  Perhaps you mean that they contradict one another, or each claim to be the ""one true way"". Doubtless, in some cases you are correct, and in other cases incorrect.

If you mean mutually exclusive in the sense of logically incoherent, or contradictory, then you win the prize for truism of the month.

Claiming that religions are irrational, or contradict one another, or purporting to 'disprove' them is as philosophically naive as creationism.

"reddit.com","t5_6","For an atheist Jefferson sure talked about God a lot, even postulating that our rights are endowed by God.  I would say that Jefferson had an independent mind (as did Washington, Franklin, and many other FFs of the time), but he was more of a Deist than an Atheist.  He never explicitly called himself a Deist, but he did say that he was a Unitarian, and did say that his faith derived from the works of men who were Deists.  Note also that when he rewrote the Bible (Jefferson's Bible is pretty cool), he did not remove all references to divinity, just all references to supernatural activity/miracles, which is in concord with Deism.

As for Lincoln, while he did say, ""I am not a member of any Christian Church,"" I recall from reading about his frequent discussions with a pastor of his day (I can look up the details if you care), he seemed to have views basically in line with Deists, that there was a divinity, it had some form of providential relationship with the cosmos, but it was not personal, nor was it revealed through a book (and Jesus was a prophet not God).

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; You act as though having many old theories replaced by new theories is something unique to economics, when this is actually how the scientific method works.

But unlike economics, our basic understanding of physics is not changing every 10 years or so. Also, the predictive nature of science allows us to do things like put a man on the moon without relying entirely on trial and error. Economic theories are typically useful in understanding and anticipating markets whose members subscribe to the same theories. 

&gt; It is also important to realize the the formal study of economics is relatively young, and is still growing. It's a bit unfair to compare it to physics, which is arguably the oldest science.

I had been wondering if you could say that economics was simply a primitive science and analogous in some ways to say, alchemy. Even if that were true, we obviously shouldn't base national policies on this kind of theory any more than we should turn the courts over to witchfinders. But we do have economists, who might just as well be reading tealeaves half the time, with huge influence  on government, business and the markets. Russia is an example of a country whose economy was pretty much ruined because they listened to the prescriptions of experts pulling just such a confidence trick. The problem with considering economics as a science is that while an Islamic revolution in the USA would cause a catastrophic failure of current economic theories, gravity would continue as normal.

I feel fairly certain that the various molecules making up the air in my room won't spontaneously decide to crowd into one corner of the room. Yes, it's theoretically possible, but pretty dang unlikely.

Similarly, one may come to a conclusion on the existance or non existance of god in a similar sense, and consider the issue effectively closed not in that it is absolutely certain in the ""sound deductive argument"" sense, but in the probabalistic sense. (Computing Bayes factors and so on and such may be one way to do this)

My point is claiming ""you can't disprove it, so you should 50%/50% believe it,"" even if true, is like saying ""I can't be certain that if I played the lottery I wouldn't win, so I should consider the probability that I'd win 1/2"".

Using observation and other prior information, one may make inductive inferences. Not certainty, but potentially close to. (Or at least construct confidence levels for various specific religions and such)

The community overrides individual choices by passing laws: 

Community decisions as to how much each person should contribute in support of the government are reflected in the income tax code; 

How much the community thinks a landlord should charge tenants is reflected in rent control laws;

What the community thinks a land owner should do with his property is reflected in  zoning restrictions;

What the community thinks the price of imports should be is reflected in tariffs; 

What the community thinks a worker should be paid is reflected in minimum wage laws.

Sowell argues that decisions made in this way are not as good as when decisions are made directly by the individuals involved.

Churches will tell you everything? There has been a long founded history of the church covering up information they don't like, such as the Gospel of Thomas that portrays a more mystic Jesus. The whole notion of Paul's conversion and then pretty much taking over the religion and ""reinterpreting"" it always seemed pretty dodgy to me. And the vatican's [library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Secret_Archives) having lost everything before the 8th century for ""reasons unkown"" (or unpalatable?) also smacks of hiding what the religion is actually based on.

Vectors are abstract, so their representation doesn't matter, and scalars only need to come from a field (basically, ""things that have division"" like Q, R, C, &amp; things in between), or sometimes just a commutative ring with identity.

There are plenty of discrete vector spaces -- you can even define vector spaces with finite scalar fields or finite sets of vectors.  One example of this last is finite-precision binary arithmetic, i.e. what your computer does.  The theory is useful too -- signal processing people have defined a whole theory of discrete integral transforms, etc. etc. etc.",1143193095
"reddit.com","t5_6","This is by far the best article on free speech I have read. It is a bit long, but make sure you at least read the last section, it is sublime.

I wish I had written something like this:

&gt; Free speech does not mean accepting all views. It means having all views in the open so that we can challenge the ones we find unconscionable. Today, we do the exact opposite: we ban certain views because they are deemed unpalatable. But there are others we are also frightened of challenging because we don't want to give offence to diverse cultures.
&gt; 
&gt; The very fact that we talk of ideas as ""offensive"" is indicative of the problem. There are many ways of disagreeing with someone's views – we may see them as irrational, reactionary, or just plain wrong. But to deem an idea ""offensive"" is to put it beyond the bounds of rational debate. Offensiveness is an affront to an entrenched tradition, a religious precept, or one's emotional sensibilities that cannot be erased by reasoned argument. It is a notion that sits well with the moralizing, emoting, often irrational approach to politics that we all too often see today.
&gt; 
&gt; But hatred, of course, exists not just in speech. Hatred has physical consequences. Racism can lead to racist attacks, homophobia to anti-gay violence. In November 2005, two men were sentenced to life for murdering black teenager Anthony Walker with an axe simply because of his skin colour. Isn't it important, then, to limit the fomenting of hatred to protect the lives of those who may be attacked? Simply by asking this question, we are revealing the distinction between speech and action: saying something is not the same as doing it. But in these post-ideological, post-modern times, it has become very unfashionable to insist on such a distinction.
&gt; 
&gt; In blurring the distinction between speech and action, what is really being blurred is the idea of human agency and moral responsibility because lurking underneath the argument is the idea that people respond like automata to words or images. But people are not like robots. They think and reason and act upon their thoughts and reasoning. Words certainly have an impact on the real world, but that impact is mediated through human agency.
&gt; 
&gt; Racists are, of course, influenced by racist talk. But it is they who bear responsibility for translating racist talk into racist action. Ironically, for all the talk of using free speech responsibly, the real consequence of the demand for censorship is to moderate the responsibility of individuals for their actual actions.",1143193322

On page one I showed you the kind of 'news' found in the newspaper.

&gt; A defector once told me of a visit to the hospital he had made while growing up in the North. Alone in his hospital room he was looking at the radio and noticed that a previous patient had somehow broken it open and rigged up a crude tuner. Risking imprisonment he searched for and found a South Korean station and got his first taste of the outside world. Nearly 25 years later he could still recall that first broadcast and what he had heard - a news story that, to his amazement, contained an interview with the South Korean president.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Slavery was a fact of life in biblical times, and very different to 19th century slavery. Slaves back then were simply a lower-lower class of society. They had rights, could own property and hold jobs. In OT times, Hebrews could sell themselves into slavery to pay off debts, and buy their way out when they liked (is taking out a mortgage much different?). Every 6 years, all such slaves were released unconditionally (the 'jubilee year').

As for morality, the bible gives both absolute principles and relative applications. ""All people are made in the image of God"" is absolute. In a society where slavery is commonplace, this is expressed as laws protecting slaves' well-being. In the 18th century it prompted Christian reformers (Wilberforce &amp; co). to call for slavery's abolition. The same absolute morality is at work. By contrast, an atheist has no logical reason not to treat his fellow human-being as pure property, to be abused at will.

Same deal with polygamy. In Genesis, one man marries one woman, and divorce is not an option (""they shall be made one flesh""). In OT times, polygamy and divorce were facts of life, hence laws were given protecting women. In the NT, Jesus says these laws were concessions, not endorsements - ""Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."" (Matt 19). There is a clear ""way things should be"".

Similarly, the age of consent varies with custom, but the underlying belief that child abuse is wrong is absolute, and common to all societies.

Washington has a great quote mocking Jefferson's novel religious views, but I have been unable to quickly dig it up.

As for Jefferson, his comments on separation of church and state have been grossly exaggerated into some kind of brilliant statesmanship, in my opinion.  A more skeptical, neutral approach would be to recognize the fact that he was attacked by clergymen on the religious question during the 1800 campaign, which was perhaps the most divisive and controversial presidential election in American history.  Though he eventually won that election, he became even more deeply suspicious of the influence of religious leaders.  His 1802 comments against the influence of clergymen in the political realm should be viewed through the lens of man bitter about the hell he received during the 1800 election and ready to exact his revenge.  In other words, politics as usual.

After quoting a steroid expert and physician who says that that ""testing only catches the dumb and the lazy,"" the author writes, ""If local police departments took this same approach to law enforcement our country would be in real trouble.""  

But many people do believe that sending the police after drug users is futile and a waste of public resources.  And in any case, that has nothing to do with whether or not smart athletes and doctors can conceal doping from drug testers, because it's been shown time and again that they can.  

These drugs have their own limitations.  The recent book on Barry Bonds' doping notes that after he started his steroid regimen, his injury rate went up along with his home run count because his outsized muscles were tearing at his tendons and bones.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I like the way he describes some of the techniques, but I think the description of dynamic programming is a little confusing.  Yes, you cache solutions to sub-problems, but just because you use a cache doesn't make it dynamic programming.  For example, if you used a cache during a divide an conquer algorithm, it would do no good since there are no overlapping sub-problems.  The key aspects of a problem that is best solved using dynamic programming are:

- The problem can be broken into sub-problems.  The optimal solution to these subproblems can be combined to form the optimal complete solution. (This is also true of divide and conquer).

- The sub-problems will overlap; i.e you will hit the same sub-problem through different paths.  This is the key difference that makes caching necessary.  Think of the computation tree of divide and conquer as a tree, and that of dynamic programming as a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

Note that 3 of his first 4 emails contain threats - even after two of the responses clearly point out what the situation is and how he should go about resolving it.  He's not even reading the responses once he figures out that they don't kowtow to him!  More importantly, note what he does after he's been proven wrong.  He has an opportunity to make things right, but instead he makes a weaselly ""apology"" that puts half the blame on Johhny Hughes and the other half on his hosting provider.  That's the key difference between you and me and Jerry Taylor.  We would figure out that we were wrong, apologize, and thank the other guy for helping us.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Can you *really* claim that signing statements would hold no weight on a supreme court that includes one of the *architects* of the signing-statements-as-power-grabs maneuver? Alito in the Justice department wrote they ""would increase the power of the executive to shape the law.""  He made it possible for Ed Meese to declare in 1986:  ""To make sure that the President's own understanding of what's in a bill is the same ... or is *given consideration at the time of statutory construction later on by a court*, we have now arranged with the West Publishing Company that the presidential statement on the signing of a bill will accompany the legislative history from Congress so that all can be *available to the court for future construction of what that statute really means*.""

It has been *more* than just a commentary for Bush.  That he has applied it with such regularity demonstrates how useful he believes it to be.  For crying out loud, he has used it *more* times in his terms than it had *ever* been used previously, *in all the other presidencies combined*.

It has been his statement of interpretation, used in *every case* to attempt to broadly expand presidential authority, narrow down legislative authority, and effectively cut the judiciary out of the process altogether.

Signing statements are included in the *published legislative history of the laws* they are attached to.  They are an attempt to change the understanding of the *intent* of the law.  Congressional intent is an important consideration the courts use when they have to interpret a law.  They'll use committee reports, floor statements, hearings, etc. from the legislative history.  Now the president is speaking as if he were a member of Congress, and *his* presidential intent is part of the legislative history.

Big deal, you say?  The court can just ignore it?  That is unlikely, what with a champion of this philosophy now sitting on the highest court in the land.  When asked about it during his confirmation, Alito refused comment about it, leaving the suggestion that this WILL be coming before the court.

In practice, the president has used Signing Statements to disapprove of over 500 *specific provisions* of legislation that became law, and to declare constitutional challenges to those provisions. The Presentment Clause of that very Constitution ( http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec7.html ) spells out: ""If he approve he shall sign it, but *if not he shall return it, with his Objections* to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.""  By declaring his intent to not follow particular parts of the law, he is using the signing statement as a back-door form of Line Item Veto, against the clear language of the Presentment Clause.   The Presentment Clause was used to strike down a law that had given a line item veto to the president.

Signing Statements have become power grabs that have unbalanced our system of Checks and Balances.  Our founding fathers were QUITE concerned about the unchecked power of a unitary executive, having just broken free of a monarchy.  Madison wrote about it in the Federalist papers, and Paine in Common Sense.  Now we have a president who says that particular sections of the *written law* run counter to his *philosophy* of presidential power, and so they just don't apply.

Maybe you are right. that's not a line item veto.  That's despotism.

It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual immaturity and - through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others - a kind of synthetic evil.",1143329914

I suppose it really depends on the audience. I've certainly seen that strategy work for theatrical performances. At one large production, the entire play came to a stand-still while one particularly rude female audience member took a call on her mobile. Some time passed before she realised that she was the centre of attention of the entire theatre. Needless to say, every other member of the audience rushed to ensure that their phones were switched off.",1143335057

As do I. However, the argument I was *actually* making is very different. Without adequate warning to potential visitors, the theater would be very much liable for a customer unkowingly missing an important call.

&gt; I've missed important calls because I was sitting in classes in the tomb that is the UW Math and Computers building, but I have no recourse against the school... how would a cinema be different?

Because the situation you describe is one where the loss of signal is entirely unintentional and unexpected (the basement of the Student Union Building at UNM has the same problem), so clearly nobody could be liable for that.

However, if the theater deliberately employs cellphone jammers -- or, as you suggested, covertly builds their theater out of EM-blocking material in a poorly-conceived attempt at plausible deniability -- then they are very much liable for the consequences if they fail to warn those who enter the building.

I will also go out of my way to avoid any establishment that uses such devices. Personally, I think it's a lot more rude to sever a form of communication I've come to rely on than to briefly interrupt my movie or meal with the latest 50 Cent ringtone.

I don't buy the idea that it says ""Advertising Archives"" on the edge makes any difference either.  We are very likely not looking an original copy from ""Housekeeping Monthly"" but an archived copy.  Hence, the phrase on the edge of the page.

As to this being some sort of terrible thing for women to be taught -- one needs to remember also that men were taught to always work hard, never to bring the office home in any sense (unless it was to have the boss over for dinner and even then work shouldn't be discussed), and that only an abject failure would have a wife who works.

To put it in a sort of ""inverse feminist terminology"" -- a man had to be utterly stoic and a tireless worker who provided for his family's every need until he died prematurely of a heart attack caused by the stress.  That doesn't sound like such a good deal any more.

Perhaps it may seem quaint today but what we are really looking at is only clearly separated gender roles, not the subservience of one gender to another.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Here's their explanation from [http://www.worldvaluessurvey.com](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.com) :


&gt; The Traditional/Secular-rational values dimension reflects the contrast between societies in which religion is very important and those in which it is not. A wide range of other orientations are closely linked with this dimension. Societies near the traditional pole emphasize the importance of parent-child ties and deference to authority, along with absolute standards and traditional family values, and reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia, and suicide. These societies have high levels of national pride, and a nationalistic outlook. Societies with secular-rational values have the opposite preferences on all of these topics.

&gt;The second major dimension of cross-cultural variation is linked with the transition from industrial society to post-industrial societies-which brings a polarization between Survival and Self-expression values. The unprecedented wealth that has accumulated in advanced societies during the past generation means that an increasing share of the population has grown up taking survival for granted. Thus, priorities have shifted from an overwhelming emphasis on economic and physical security toward an increasing emphasis on subjective well-being, self-expression and quality of life. Inglehart and Baker (2000) find evidence that orientations have shifted from Traditional toward Secular-rational values, in almost all industrial societies. But modernization, is not linear-when a society has completed industrialization and starts becoming a knowledge society, it moves in a new direction, from Survival values toward increasing emphasis on Self-expression values.

&gt;A central component of this emerging dimension involves the polarization between Materialist and Postmaterialist values, reflecting a cultural shift that is emerging among generations who have grown up taking survival for granted. Self-expression values give high priority to environmental protection, tolerance of diversity and rising demands for participation in decision making in economic and political life. These values also reflect mass polarization over tolerance of outgroups, including foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality. The shift from survival values to self-expression values also includes a shift in child-rearing values, from emphasis on hard work toward emphasis on imagination and tolerance as important values to teach a child. And it goes with a rising sense of subjective well-being that is conducive to an atmosphere of tolerance, trust and political moderation. Finally, societies that rank high on self-expression values also tend to rank high on interpersonal trust.
This produces a culture of trust and tolerance, in which people place a relatively high value on individual freedom and self-expression, and have activist political orientations. These are precisely the attributes that the political culture literature defines as crucial to democracy. 

[This newer map](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.com/images/feature_pics/valuemap.gif) calls it ""self expression"" instead of ""well-being"".

I think the red arrows with ""poor"" and ""rich"" points to a general trend that as countries become richer they tend to place more emphasis on secular-rational/self-expression, instead of traditional/survival values.",1143411808

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;The administration is claiming that any limitation on the president is similarly unconstitutional, and that therefore, no matter what bills are passed and what actions are taken, the president is in the clear.

As the poster you are responding to said:

&gt;It is not up to the executive branch to decide that a law is unconstitutional.

If a bill were passed that limited the President's term to 3 years, the President's proper course of action is this:

**Step A**. Veto.

**Step B**. Immediately get a judge to grant a temporary injunction, suspending implementation of the law until it can be tried in court.  Note that the judiciary would be *extremely* deferential to a sitting President of the United States making such a request; playing the ""what if"" game that he couldn't get a temporary injunction in such a situation is fantasy to the point of absurdity.

**Step C**. Bring it before the courts, and get the law thrown out.

Absolutely nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to do anything to a bill placed before him except veto it, approve it, or just ignore it - and if he ignores it, it becomes law by default in ten days.

&gt;it does not involve getting lawmaking power for the executive branch.

This is semantics at best, and sophism at worst.  The President is approving ""laws"" that Congress did not approve.  That he claims to be doing so because he's supposedly overriding the unconstitutional parts of the law is neither here nor there: Under the argument that he's employing, he can *claim* that anything's unconstitutional, and do absolutely anything he wants to any bill placed before him - change it in any way.  

If you want to say that's not ""getting lawmaking power for the executive branch"", uh, okay, fine.  But it's not legal.",1143422170

"reddit.com","t5_6","A very clever idea, and an interesting read.

One thing comes to mind, though. The author claims that Mono munging (with an appropriate basis file) turns a legally copyrighted work into a non-copyrighted work (or, at least, not copyrighted by the original owner) because:

 * It is ""derived"" from both the Element file (the copyrighted work in question) and the Basis file (content not copyrighted by the copyright owner of the Element), and

 * Because the Mono file does not contain any content that can be clearly seen as belonging to the Element file, it cannot be legally considered a ""derivative"" work.

He provides good legal justification for this argument. However, when dealing with fuzzy cases like these, what is or is not ""legal"" is ultimately up to the courts to determine. And with the current legal climate what it is, it's not hard to imagine the courts re-interpreting the law in some way that determines that Mono files are ""derivative"" works of the Element and Basis files.

But what if we take it one step further? As he points out in his article, digital representations cannot legally be copyrighted -- it is the content *represented by* that interpretation that is copyrighted.

Now imagine you create a file (call it the ""Resulting"" file), and release it into the public domain. Then it is clearly legal for anyone who wishes so to share this file through FTP, e-mail, P2P, snail-mail, or whatever means they wish.

Now what if you took some Element file copyrighted by a private party and reverse-engineered your own Basis file that, through Mono, would convert the digital representation of the Element file into the digital representation of the Results file. Clearly this can be freely shared by you or anyone, because it's in the public domain. If you then release the associated Basis file into the public domain, you have two files, both of which are digital representations of public domain content. Therefore, both of these files can be freely shared with no legal problems. But if you take these two files and combine them together in the right way, you produce a digital representation of a copyrighted work.

It's hard to imagine any way that any court could legally ban the distribution of either the Results file or the Basis file, because both are digital representations of public-domain content. Therefore, the only truly illegal act in this scheme is the combining of the Results and Basis file to reproduce the Element file. That happens on an individual's computer and is nearly impossible to regulate. I know that what I'm describing sounds almost exactly like what the author is describing, but there's one crucial difference: in his example, the result of the Mono munging is a file that is, essentially, garbage. It's not a clear representation of *any* meaningful content. In my case, the result of the Mono munging is a file that is the digital representation of a work that has been released to the public domain. This clears up some of the legal fuzziness.

The biggest drawback to this scheme is that it would require the generation of a separate Basis file for each Element file (i.e., each song, or movie, or whatever). But this could possibly be automated. Oh, and of course the other drawback is that it would lead to legally untouchable sharing of copyrighted content. That would be wrong.",1143422812

"programming","t5_2fwo","Scheme is a non-pure functional language. You can add things to scheme (as well as to common lisp) that allow type annotations. Common Lisp is NOT a functional language but can be made to act like one.

However, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Haskell does things for you that Scheme or Lisp would have to be heavily augmented to do. For one it is a pure functional language that enforces the lack of side effects through a strict type system. This makes some things possible such as STM (http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/stm/stm.pdf)[PDF] . The Haskell type system forces STM atomicity to apply to side effect free code (check the paper for a good example).

Monadic programming is definitely possible in Scheme (http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/monad-in-Scheme.html) but with nowhere near the syntactic support that Haskell has.

Now all of that said, I've done a bit of work in Haskell and doing anything disk/IO intensive is a royal pain in the arse. Composing monads can be awfully confusing as well, which is what you end up having to do if you want to, say, add an error monad to an IO operation. It makes up for that sort of thing when you move on to more heavily algorithmic/logical programming.

For instance writing an evaluator in Haskell has to be one of the most pleasant experiences ever. Writing a simple lambda calc interpreter is close behind the factorial as far as the Haskell ""hello world"" app goes.

Check it out, it's gauranteed to make your brain twist around a bit and I would wager that even if you don't use it you'll come out with an expanded perspective.

&gt;Maternity leave, on near full pay, ranges from 20 weeks for the first child to 40 or more for a third. A whole gamut of grants, allowances and tax breaks is available, increasing substantially once a family has three children: all French ""familles nombreuses"" get some €300 in monthly allowances and travel as good as free on public transport.
&gt;At the same time, the network of state-run or state-approved creches - for children from two months old - has been expanded over the past decade or so, as has the number of state-registered childminders. Depending on the family's income, childcare costs from virtually nothing to around €500 a month for the most well-off. Nursery school from 8.30am to 4.30pm is free for every child from the age of three.

"reddit.com","t5_6","
&gt;There is no population problem. Population growth is the result of the plunging death rate and increasing life expectancy worldwide. That is progress.

Unless birth rates drop further, unsustainable progress.

&gt;The growth in human population has been more than met by increases in the production of food and other resources, including energy. Famine in the 20th century is a political rather than an ecological phenomenon. We are not running out of resources, and real prices of raw materials are lower than ever before. Only the price of labor consistently rises. Population growth and economic growth are compatible: Between 1776 and 1975, while the world's population increased sixfold, real gross world product rose about 80-fold. People are net resource producers.

People and technology magnify the economic value of raw materials or use resources available to them to provide further services.  These raw materials, however, are physically limited.  Current estimates state maximum populations of about 10-15 billion, if every inch of arable land were seeded with the best available GM crops.  However, if we wish to preserve such luxuries as global biodiversity and occasional animal protein, much of this land will need to be reserved for other purposes.  The time to address these problems is now, not in 40-60 years' time when such limits may be reached.

Poor nations have many difficulties, among them trade restrictions by richer nations and predatory financial arrangements that lead to corrupt, thuggish regimes that impoverish their people (and thereby eliminate any competitive threat they might pose to industrialised nations.)  It is certainly the case that improved economic welfare leads to a drop in fertility, but many poor nations have immediate and pressing problems meeting their people's basic physical needs, due to a harsh climate, limited technology or both.  In addition, 'Market Liberalism' is often a smokescreen for the introduction of large-scale corporate cronyism that chiefly benefits first-world industrial magnates and often results in gross human rights violations.  Nike springs to mind.

There were, indeed, terrible adverse side-effects to population restrictions in China and India.  And while it is true that economic prosperity should be the most efficient means to address population growth, many couples in developing countries insist on large families as a means of economic insurance against old age and child mortality- and what is rational for the individuals in such a case is irrational for the society at large.  This is *exactly* what government exists to address.  Many social ills are the result of self-reinforcing chains of factors that cannot be tackled by addressing any link in isolation, be it trade barriers or cultural attitudes.

&gt;The late Roger Revelle of Harvard University (whom Gore claims as a mentor) estimated that Africa, Asia, and Latin America alone, simply by using water more efficiently, could feed 35 to 40 billion people..

http://dieoff.org/page99.htm

""A few years ago, for example, a group of Catholic bishops, misinterpreting a thought exercise by Roger Revelle (1976), asserted that Earth could feed 40 billion people (Anonymous, 1988); various social scientists have made estimates running as high as 150 billion (Livi-Bacci, 1989). These assertions are based on preposterous assumptions, and we do not deal further with them here.""

&gt;""More population means more creators and producers, both of goods along established production patterns and of new knowledge and inventions.""

Current knowledge and inventions are more than adequate to address the problems of developing nations, but they lack the resources to take advantage of these.

&gt;Actually, natural resources do not exist at all. All resources are manmade.

Until we can defy the law of conservation of matter and energy, their supply remains limited.

&gt;Doubters need only study the quality of life on the pre-Columbian North American continent, when several million Indians barely scratched out their subsistence amid the same ""natural resources"" that today enrich the lives of billions of people worldwide.

"reddit.com","t5_6","One of Cato's main thrusts is limiting government.  To that end, the testimony includes:

&gt;What the poor nations suffer from is not too much population but too much government.

But they fail to notice that *government* is a obvious side effect of *population*.  The more people there are, the more those people *demand* government to mediate their relationships with the rest of the population.  

Crypto-anarcho-whatevero-libertarianism is a simple prospect when you are living by yourself in a cabin in the woods.  In fact, that's pretty much the default governmental philosophy in such a situation.

But when you are living cheek-to-jowl in a packed urban center, it is far too easy (and common) to get screwed in big and small ways by some random stranger.  (Robbed, rented an apartment in a structurally-unsound building, live next to a hazardous waste-site, sold defective products or improperly handled food, deli-counter guy puts his thumb on the scale when he weighs your food, ...)

It is all very easy to live by implicit or explicit contracts when the number of your interactions are few.  But the more people you interact with, the less you are able to demand integrity from those people.  And the less integrity *you* have to provide in your transactions.  Human impulses being what they are, people will tend to maximize their personal return, often at the expense of others in subtle and obvious ways.

Example:  You go to Pizza Hut.  You buy what you presume to be a cheese pizza.  It's a standard commodity item.  Lots of places sell cheese pizzas.  Lots of competition in the marketplace, lots of choice for you, the consumer.  Pizza Hut buys its ""cheese"" as a commodity from a low-cost producer.  Makes sense, Pizza Hut wants to maximize its profits in a commodity business.  Likewise, that ""cheese"" producer wants to minimize *its* costs and maximize profits.  So it turns out that they add a lot of less-expensive-than-dairy-ingredients, water-retaining *vegetable starch* in it (something that good-old-fashioned-made-straight-from-cows-milk-cheese doesn't really have).  But, surprise, that starch filler tends to make the ""cheese"" go bad in the freezer faster, and bake differently than conventional cheese (it will make big bubbles that will get real dark and thus look unpleasant to most pizza consumers), so the supplier has to *add an additional un-cheese-like-something* to reduce this tendency: [Silicone](http://reddit.com/info?id=253q), a substance not normally considered to be food.

Now, I ask you, can an individual go in to any particular Pizza Hut and negotiate with the person at the cash register to get a Pizza that doesn't have any of that silicone-starch ""cheese"" in it?  Will the public representatives (employees and managers) even know what the heck you are talking about?  Will they care if they do, or will they be more concerned about their paycheck?

The natural tendency of a person is to try to create an entity that will work on their behalf to prevent this, and other kinds of, injustice.  The more people there are, the more those people will be clamoring for a government to operate on behalf of their *collective* interests.

I believe that limited government is much more practicable with limited population.  But that's not what we have, and that's not where the population is headed.

But Cato says that all growth is progress, and that must include population growth.  After all, more people = more consumers and more producers.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Since you ask, I'll try to point out a few things. First, many people (including myself) have probably thought long and hard, read books, and discussed with others various religious questions. When you dismiss that as ""a special degree of mental shallowness"" you insult us.

You continue this insult with saying ""it takes an exceedingly simple mind to actually believe..."" which is another insult. (And a number of respected philosophers and other clever folk are out-an-out atheists, e.g. Hume, Dennet, Dawkins)

Regarding the whole logic debate, there are two important sub-points. One is functional: I can't disprove that invisible elves make my engine run, but it doesn't mean I should believe it.

The second is consistency: while I might not be able to ""disprove"" that there is some sort of the supernatural being who exists outside of the measurable universe, this is not the same as a Judaeo-Christian god -- the idea of an omnipotent, moral god who cares about what happens to people. Here I think this hypothesis is inconsistent with the facts (i.e. the world as we know it), and I reject it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Taxes provide incentives to change behavior, that's true, but a higher tax doesn't provide the incentive to spur on a whole new market. Often times tax incentives simply get swept up in the economies of scale - it's cheaper to pay a higher tax to move a whole lot of product via container ship to the Bay Area  than it is for small, nearby farms to swap crops (especially with the real estate prices around there!). This may cause dismay for people who feel guilt at consuming energy, but as I said elsewhere, they have another choice - they can die. With the way people get swept up in the desire to do good that they ignore the facts of reality, that may be a good option for them.

But seriously, though, it's not as cut and dried as ""what's the smallest 'carbon footprint' that can be created"". It's about having enough stuff on hand, and enough stuff coming down the pike, for all the people who are going to buy it, finding the right price high enough to pay for the costs and make a little on the side but low enough to keep people buying and keep the pipeline flowing at optimum capacity. People have this notion that the box on the store shelf costs as much in time and materials as it takes for one to decide whether to purchase it, and that replacing the box they took from the shelf is simply a matter of getting another carton from the back.

Making the ridiculous assumption that the farmer had $1.75 in energy cost for that bushel, then his two ounce serving of oats used 0.9 ounces of oil (32 lbs/bu, $1.00/gal oil).  It's unlikely that it was more than 0.4 oz.  So he is off by at least a factor of 10.

As an interesting aside, note that oats in the store are 80 times what they cost in bulk, thanks to marketing and middlemen.

Maybe he should raise his own oats.  He would need an area 32 ft by 32 ft, to be planted, tended, harvested, and milled.  That would produce the 1.43 bushels of oats he eats (60 bu/acre), assuming 2 oz. per day for a year.  He'd need to fertilize the area, or he would probably need three times that much space for a sustained yield.  To set aside for bad years, add another 50%.

If he doesn't have that big a 'garden', or doesn't want to make the considerable effort, he could give the farmer $2.50 instead of giving Trader Joe's $180 for his year's supply.  That's what food co-ops are all about.

But of course he doesn't have any solution.  Just complaints and disgusting images of oil floating in his oats.

Oh, and roasting a pound of coffee takes about a half oz of oil, not a quart.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I find it curious that every gung-ho endorsement of LaTeX/TeX attempts
a comparison between the LaTeX way and the WYSIWIG way, and
degenerates into cheap shots at MS Word. 

MS Word is not the last word in typesetting, folks. Magazine editors
and book authors who care about style don't sit around wasting time
doing textual markup. Try using some grown-up software like Adobe
InDesign or Framemaker and see how productive it makes you.

My argument is this: WYSIWIG is good, there is good software available
to do it, and it is worth the money.

Perhaps the last one is controversial. Adobe's most expensive bundle
is $1500, where you get the works. In any other trade, say photography
or carpentry or building construction, you wouldn't balk at spending
this sum of money if it is directly relevant to your trade, or helps
you do it well .. no self-respecting contractor will buy a $1500 car
to ferry him around. But there is this strange resistance to putting
in a chunk of money on software even if it helps you save time. I have
seen any number of books where the authors acknowledge the
contribution of some LaTeX wizard and I am speaking of professional
computer scientists who should have no problem figuring out LaTeX. You
don't see anyone being thanked for their FrameMaker or PageMaker
skills, do you? LaTeX is hard for even simple things like changing the
style of table of contents or changing fonts.
See [this](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rf/pstex/latexcommands.htm)
for a sample. One really shouldn't require a FAQ entry for changing fonts.

I am a computer scientist and I know LaTeX well and admire it for its
typesetting capabilities, esp mathematical text. But I daresay those
who claim it to be better than WYSIWIG have not acquainted themselves
with real WYSIWIG software.

And no, I'm not an Adobe lackey; merely a satisfied user.

Kudos to the author for wanting to try something different. But in my opinion, his approach is just wrong. I know the system is broken. I know from first hand experience, but legalization isn't going to happen...and it shouldn't. No matter how you cut it up, when you legalize, you condone.

""Honestly how many people do you think are out there right now that would just love to get thier hands on some meth but cannot because it is illegal?""

You missed the point. I know of lots of kids who aren't dying to get their hands on Meth, but they would consider giving it a try if it were legal. Yes... lots of them. It's not about the people who are already seeking it out and trying to get their hands on it (they can already get it). It's that by legalizing it, you condone it and make it ""OK"" to try it. And there is healthy evidence to support that even one use can lead to addiction and that one time can lead to brain damage and other problems.

MDMA (and MDA for that matter, which turns out to be a much easier and tidier synthesis using modern reagents) is powerfully serotonergic.  Methamphetamine and amphetamine seem to be mostly dopaminergic.  (No, I do not know why this is.  But apparently closing that heterocyclic appendage changes the nature of the beast as far as the brain is concerned.)  Once you've squirted out all your serotonin, it seems like it takes a while for it to build back up.  So there's no real point binging on X, that would be a waste of money.  Whereas you can tweak for days on end and still get results.  That's got to play some role in the 'cultures'.

In any event, if someone sticks up a 7-11, beats their wife, or drives a car into a nursery school while frying on X, they ought to end up in the slammer just like a drunk or a crackhead (or a guy who's sober as a judge, for that matter).

I disagree.

Further, many consumers would need to be experts in a ridiculously wide range of subjects. From  insurance, to banking, to civil engineering, to energy markets.

The other reasons may have their importance, but the main one is the one above.

...Shaidurov has concluded that only an enormous natural phenomenon, such as an asteroid or comet impact or airburst, could seriously disturb atmospheric water levels, destroying persistent so-called 'silver', or noctilucent, clouds composed of ice crystals in the high altitude mesosphere (50 to 85km).

Logically, shouldn't that make the earth *colder?*

I may be missing something entirely, but the other thing about a catastrophic event is that it's effects should be most pronounced immediately afterward, then gradually tail off.  Meaning, temperatures should have peaked in the early 20th century, then returned to normal levels by now.  The depletion of high-atmospheric H2O may or may not be significant, but even if the reduced levels were slow to recover, I see no reason, offhand, to suppose the temperature effects would somehow be cumulative over time.

Fact is, CO2 is a *proven* greenhouse gas.  *The laws of physics* dictate it will make the planet warmer.  Do you want to run the risk of it being the chief factor involved?

The answer seems to be that vim doesn't have much support for Java (don't flame me, that's what the site says). Eclipse, on the other hand, has a truly massive set of functionality -- including searching within classes, debugging support, refactoring, and their own compiler! I guess the Eclim people would like to be able to take advantage of all of that in vim.

I'm not sure running Eclipse in the background as a server is the best way to go about it though, not just because Eclipse is a big resource hog. It seems to me that it might make sense to directly call on the functionality in the Eclipse's Java tools; they're just a bunch of Java classes anyway. I wonder if that's possible?",1143560983

1. The first major event in WW3, or the Civilization Clash or whatever you call it was 9/11. 

2. 9/11 did not happen as a response to a particular event preceeding it, but as an ideology-motivated attack on the US by fundamental Islam.

3. By the above, I mean that, while US actions certainly contributed to fuel fundamentalists anger towards it, what is really happening now is a confrontation between contradicting value systems. The US might withdraw its forces and try not to do anything that could annoy Bin Laden, and yet the very existance of it and it's values will always cause a friction with fundamental values.

Being fooled or neglecting to detect a deception and acting upon that false knowledge is not lying.  Is it really so difficult to understand this?

If you base your entire argument against Bush on this 'he lied' theme, what happens when we find out that WMD materials were sent to Syria?  My point is that if you are anti-Bush it isn't necessary to build your entire anti-Bush argument on the extremely weak foundation of 'he lied about WMD' *especially* when there are plenty of other reasons to be unsatisfied with the administration.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; What I'm trying to understand is what exactly caused it? Was it wrongful actions by the West, or actions that did have justification, yet annoyed Extreme Islam?

It's covered pretty well and I think quite fairly by the documentary 'The Power of Nightmares'. It's a long and interesting story but I think one of the key facts to bear in mind is that Al-Qaeda is a direct offshoot of the Mujahadeen, who were pretty much set up by the US neocon element (as part of their paranoid anti-communist ideology) - so 9/11 is very much a case of chickens coming home to roost. However, I think the 'clash of cultures' is very much overplayed by both sides for their own reasons. The main stated Al-Qaeda grievance has always been the US controlling role in Saudi and the Middle East (and following from that, control of natural resources) - this is classically political. Terrorism is a well-rehearsed strategy for forcing political change (although obviously it requires a psychopathic level of ideological commitment) - so it would have been expected.  

&gt; For example, I think Gulf War 1 was justified. Yes, it surely annoyed fundamental Muslims.

The thing is that Saddam's evidence for Kuwaiti slant-drilling came from the US who also gave him the nod to attack Kuwait. The Islamists were anti-Saddam but the deaths of Iraqis as a result of that US manoeuvre would obviously be seen as an injustice and Gulf War 1 seen as a further incursion into the Middle East.

The unwillingness or inability of many people to invest the mental acuity to distinguish between these concepts has contributed to an intellectual feeblemindedness which is akin to a malignant tumor killing our society.

If you are a materialist, then that's not necessarily true (though there are other nerve clusters in the body which play a role).

If you believe in souls, and that the brain and body are controlled via said incorporeal soul, there still must exist an interface somewhere between the soul and the brain, otherwise the soul (""mind""?) could not control the physical body (Descartes thought it was in the pituitary gland!).  If, then, the soul can control the brain, then it must be empirically observable, albeit indirectly.

If the soul is merely a helpless observer, which can't even spark a single neuron, then all the parts of the brain that light up whenever we feel emotions, or think about certain things, or move a muscle, would have to be controlled entirely in the brain, in which case, what does the observer-soul do, does it even count as the same consciousness or being, and why would we have one?",1143581479

* Do an average of 7 'high-school' subjects

* Add up percentages for your top 6 subjects (total 600)
* A computer awards you a college/university place based on your score out of 600

The computer doesn't know if you are male, female, young, old, great at sports, ran the student council or even what school you are coming from. It doesn't care.

I was basicaly thinking along the lines that for a dwarf to find some food with a spear he would have been at a distinct disadvantage.

However, in this modern world with money, if a average sized person recieves £7 or $10 it would only buy him enough food to last a small amount of time, howether the small person on the other hand could buy enough food to last him until a lot closer to christmass.

That isn't the only way they are more equiped if you ask me.

But what I'd *really do* is go SATA, double the number of drives (8, @ $99 = $792), and get a decent SATA RAID controller ($150).  In fact, stick with Linux, put together a second identical box and hang it off a broadband connection somewhere else in town.  Rsync them through an SSH tunnel nightly.  When (not ""if"", but *when*) one of the drives starts failing, the system text-messages me, and I go in and attend to it.  Most times, I swap drives, but in the worst case, I swap the whole machine with its backup one, diddle a couple of .conf files and it's live again.

It's 4 times as expensive as the $500 DIY in the article.  But I'll save at *least* that much by avoiding the downtime that *will* otherwise happen when one of those drives craps out, taking as much as 1/4 of all my project data with it.",1143644561

To get them, you would be forced  to become a person who thinks about things reflectively, rather than going about parroting the views of your favorite pundits.   To start, instead of pulling out the least nuanced, most ignorant, knee-jerk, rabidly partisan response possible (I assume to try to win some imaginary points for your side), you should actually try to critically read the link and consider it honestly.  And to be a good liberal, you would need to consider it in light of other writings, and acknowledge that it may or may not be true based on a critical reading, and how well it coheres with your education, and not on the basis of whose 'side' you imagine the writer is on.  What wins you those credentials is lots of education and critical reading.  In the process, most learned people will discover a very remarkable thing.  Human efforts towards progress regularly have unintended consequences.  In earning your credentials you would recognize that the benefits of the Green Revolution came at some cost.  And learning to have a nuanced view, you might perhaps judge that it was worth that cost, perhaps not.  And you would back your position up with arguments, using critical reasoning skills and citing that stuff you spent time reading.

As it is, you clearly have no liberal credentials, since your post is a mix of monumental ignorance, a clear illustration that you did not read, let alone analyze the argument the author contributed,  and a slew of logical fallacies.  Posts of that sort might earn you conservative credentials, and they are certainly easier to do, but they add nothing to a discussion, nor do they help anyone in trying to understand the issues at hand.

They are liberated from the binds of inherited culture, which is the root of the word.  Liberalism is anti-dogmatic.  There are those who might call themselves a liberal, but who just parrot their favorite heroes without much understanding, those people are not especially liberal.  

Historically a conservative was someone did not trust human reason as adequate to understand the root of the problems we face, which was why they upheld holding to inherited cultural traditions, and opposed change, even if there appeared to be a good account for doing so.  They conserve their culture,  which is the root of the word.  An argument could be made for this position, but it isn't what modern conservatism is about.

If you want to 'capture' a block for later use you can call 'lambda' as in:  
  a = lambda { #the block }

So lambda is a method call with an implicit receiver of self and zero arguments.  Its return value is an instance of the Proc class, a core class provided by the language.  The block is captured within the Proc instance and can be called via the Proc object:  
  a.call 
 
Arguments can be passed also to blocks that expect them:  
  a.call(1,2,3)

There has been some experimentation with the parser to allow Proc objects to be implicitly created from the block syntax:  

  add = { |a,b| a + b }     # EXPERIMENTAL: a lambda that adds its two arguments  

Finally there are some alternative ways to create Proc objects:  
  Proc.new { #the block }    
  proc { #the block }  
Proc objects created in this way have slightly different semantics from Procs created via lambda that I don't want to go into here.",1143667786

"reddit.com","t5_6","As a Utah resident, my email to the Election Commission:
""Dear Elections division,
(this email has been copied to Lt. Governor Gary Herbert and Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr.)

I am appalled at an article that was in the Salt Lake Tribune yesterday, March 28th, 2006, (http://www.sltrib.com/ci_3646075), entitled "" New vote machines ignite feud in Emery"".  The story is that the Emery county clerk had concerns that there was possibly some hidden software on these Diebold voting machines that apparently haven't had any independent review.  Hence he had them independently reviewed, which caused Diebold *and* Lt. Governor Gary Herbert to become upset.  It's shocking that the state of Utah would spend $27 million to purchase new voting machines from a company that doesn't allow anyone to independently review the fairness and accuracy of the machines. 

I'm a registered republican, and the precinct chair (as I have been for years), but am very concerned about the impartiality of any company that isn't independantly reviewed.  In fact, in a GOP fundraising letter dated Aug. 14, 2003, Diebold CEO Walden O'Dell openly declared he was ""committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president [Bush] next year.""  That at the *very least* should make independent reviews of their voting products a necessity, if not completely compromising their claims to voting fairness.

It's completely understandable that a third party looking at voting machines could possibly compromise them, depending on how they are designed.  But if someone looking at the machines can cause them to be compromised, then how on earth can you put them in voting booths when hundreds of people will have physical access to them in a private setting? The very idea that the machines can't be inspected by a third party shows just how fragile these systems apparently are.  Why hasn't Diebold designed a hardwired electronic circuit or a mechanical system with failsafes such that the machines can't be hacked, and the wrong candidate will not be selected if the machine fails?

If the machines can't be verified as uncompromised on voting day by an election staffer at a voting location multiple times throughout the day, that's a huge problem. For the voting commission to accept Diebold's line that ""That's the way it is"" is simply unacceptable.

Slot machines in Nevada can be checked against any number of parameters to make sure that 1) hardware has not been added or replaced, 2) the software has not been altered (from the registered version on file with the NGC) and 3) the settings for the software match the casino's payout statements. The casino can do these checks, the NGC can do these checks, interested public parties can do these checks (with the cooperation of either the casino or the NGC).

Shouldn't we expect at least as much from the recordkeepers of democracy as we expect from a gambling house?
Your response will be appreciated.

The poetry that I use, of course - Emily Dickinson, Shakespeare, Yeats - is all available free online.

Granted, this doesn't work for everyone, and I'm excluding math/science education, sports, the costs of running a school, the costs of bringing quality talent in, etc. But $16,000 a year and kids learning nothing is a disgrace. Someone's getting away with quite a bit in those failing systems.

I still dont understand why they just dont use lisp. 

But I can think of a few killer reasons why lisp may be a hinderance &amp; it has nothing to do with the language, hardware usage. It has more to do with development tools &amp; integration to the stack (db, webserver) and speed of development for *average programmers*. 

CLI, non visual tools, lots of code generation, This may not be a problem to some who want to invest time in learning how to do this but for those looking for a *faster* way (code monkeys) to genereate apps lisp may fall short compared to say Rails.  

Faster can mean more $$$ due to lower development costs. So in short its possible the commercial imperative may dictate lisps` choice more than mere technical reasons when it comes to reducing costs.

Creating a product faster, generating more $$$ does not imply a better product, Simply a  more commercial one.",1143688324

"reddit.com","t5_6","I also stopped taking cable and I am so much better off. I can probably help answer the question of why TV is worse than movies and music - at least in my case.

1. Time benefit: Unless you are a strict TIVOer, apart from the really good shows, you end up watching a lot of junk programming that you were never interested in the first place. With movies, I only watch movies that I have heard are really good, and have a subject matter that may interest me. Similarly with music, I can rely on other people's reviews, or at worst spend 5 minutes to hear the song. Also music can be relegated to more of a background activity and hence not take up all your attention. You can carry your music around with a media player and do a greater range activities.
2. Monetary benefit: If you are a strict TIVOer, evaluate how many shows in a year do you really end up watching that you are really interested in. In my case it was not more than 7-8 of them. I can always rent the season DVDs on netflix when the release, which is far far cheaper than paying $100 a month for cable.
With music and movies, I spend money only on stuff that I might enjoy. And thanks to ITunes, I dont buy an entire album to get a single song anymore. 

In my case, I have been able to read so many books ever since I stopped watching cable tv. I do watch a lot of movies through netflix, but never more than a movie a day. When I was watching TV, I used to end up spending close to 3 hours every day nearly watching TV, nearly half of which was stuff I didn't really want to watch.

That said, I don't agree completely with the original article. I agree that TV does have some interesting programming, it definitely has entertainment value.  I do miss the occassional documentary and weekly programs on public television, on discovery etc. But cable tv requires tremendous management and control to not waste time that could have been spent doing something else. Also, it is way too expensive to justify the entertainment that it provides.",1143688887

Why are blocks a special syntax for method calls? Why not make block arguments programmatically equivalent to other arguments, and just allow the {|..| ...} syntax to create a closure? Isn't that much neater?

For example, with the existing syntax, it's a bit funky to pass two blocks into a function if you so desire.

The funds collected from enforcing this law would be used only to fund further enforcement.

As a result, the jobs would dry up almost immediately and 12 million illegals would deport themselves.  No wall needed, no border patrol with the almost certain violence that will go along with it.

Simultaneously the US and Mexico would work on equalizing their minimum wages.  Right now, the US minimum wage is NINE TIMES the Mexican minimum which is ridiculous.  Unskilled labor is unskilled labor and an imaginary line shouldn't make any difference at all.

Once the difference in minimum wage is (for example) only two times, then the incentive to leave Mexico and come north would be greatly reduced.

These can't be the only possible solutions so, if it is so obviously feasible, why isn't the US government doing something about it?

I'd be more concerned if there were a gap among the average IQ of different ""races"" ***after*** adjusting for level of education, socioeconomic background, hell, even current amounts of sleep and what they had for breakfast this morning.

Given the genetic diversity available in all human groups socially categorized as ""races"", I would be very surprised if there were any significant differences in measurable intelligence that could be explained by genetics alone.

That said, I think society's fear of discussing even the *possibility* of said differences will leave us very ill-equipped to deal with the fallout should *any* difference in IQ be incontrovertibly identified that cannot be blamed on anything but genetics.

Would entire races renew their hatreds of each other over a lousy percent or two?  What if the evidence shows such a discrepancy, *but not in the direction predicted by prevailing stereotype?*

"reddit.com","t5_6","David Weale taught history at UPEI for 30 years. He retired last year but decided to teach one last class, History of Christianity, this year.

Up to a hundred students signed up for the subject because the name David Weale has spread through his books and his lectures. There was standing room only in his classes because Professor Weale can keep his students spellbound for two or three hours without looking at a note.

Professor Weale took, let us say, a somewhat “controversial” measure to cut down class size. Can you imagine a high school teacher with a class of 100 students? He promised the overflow a passing grade if they did not attend classes.

In my opinion, David Weale was trying to create a workable environment for himself and the students. The administration of UPEI did not see it that way and suspended Professor Weale.

He apologized but to no avail. After 30 years of teaching he was sent down the steps.

His class gathered a petition to support their professor, but in the meantime a prank anti-Muslim cartoon appeared in the student newspaper and with the press getting a hold of that, David Weale’s case was swept under the carpet.

Was Professor Weale’s view on class size really that far off the mark?

I think it is a shame that the story ended this way.
It was a black day and a big loss for our great university and for P.E.I.

I certainly hope that this episode does not silence the voice of David Weale.

"reddit.com","t5_6","David Weale made a mistake, but it was to make a point which has not been adequately addressed by the UPEI president regarding large classes and lowering standards. Surely debate of these issues is appropriate.

David Weale has been extraordinarily successful in helping Islanders, young and old, understand their roots. What other professor at UPEI has had such a profound effect on so many students?

I don’t think that David Weale, or in a broad sense all of we Islanders who remember “them times,” have been shown the respect which is our due. President Wade MacLauchlan has chosen to put a permanent black mark on a career that is far larger than a single incident or a university president who seems to be making an example of what happens to people with whom he does not agree.

1. You have to be quite smart. That is, to succeed, you'll need to be able to hold multiple large ideas in your head, and fit them together like 3d puzzle pieces. If you were exposed to mathematics as a kid, *and* have a natural aptitude, then maybe you can handle it without having to give up everything else in your life in favor of studying.

2. Not all professors understand what they're supposed to be teaching, and not all of them can actually teach. For lower-level classes this isn't usually a problem, since you can ask around and find other prof's to help you. When there's only condensed matter guy in the department and he's of no help, you end up spending a lot of time in the library banging your head against the wall.

3. As a professional theoretical physicist, I'm guessing you spend an inordinate amount of time trying to convince large organizations to continue funding your work.

Learning theoretical physics through self-study is what you do when you study this stuff at a University. It's almost all self-study, except for those crucial times where you really don't get it, and some sharp teacher asks you just the right question to help you understand.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I partially retract my previous statement about Ruby's anonymous function syntax being less scary than others. Scary isn't really the right term, but it is less straightforward than Scheme, CL or (apparently) Erlang. The reason is that this doesn't work:

    def foo{|x| x+2}

but this does:

    lambda {|x| x+2}

I won't get in to the Lisp-1/Lisp-n holy war other than to define it. This obviously applies to a number of non-Lisp languages now. A Lisp-1 makes no distinction between names for functions, variables or any other first-class objects. Scheme, Python and Arc[0] are this way. A Lisp-n has separate namespaces for regular variables, defined functions and sometimes other kind of objects. There's a special way to refer to the name of a function when passing it as an argument instead of calling it and a separate way to call functions that are stored in regular variables. CL and Ruby are this way. An example, for clarity:

Here's a variable being set to an anonymous function in Scheme:

    (define foo (lambda (x) (+ 1 x)))

which is identical in effect to

    (define (foo x) (+ 1 x))

in both cases, you can call foo in the usual way:

    (foo 4)

-&gt; 5

In Common Lisp, it's different:

    (defparameter foo (lambda (x) (+ 1 x)))

gives you a symbol foo that points to a function, but it must be called like this:

    (funcall foo 4)

-&gt; 5

Both sides think their way is clearer.

On the other hand, as a developer who has professionally developed in Visual Studio (and used other MS products) for a number of years, I do feel MS has jumped the shark. They are packing more and more unnecessary stuff in, they are making people switch and upgrade when they don't want to, they are engaging in illegal business practices, and they just have too much legacy code to schlepp around.

Historically, they've done good stuff. Their focus on usability, and on developers and third party relations brought real benefits. But I don't see it any more. I see ever better alternatives, and a more technically savvy generation.

A personal milestone was the shift from visual studio 6 to 7. Suddenly the profiler was gone, without a word. Linking of large projects took forever. Intellisense was very slow. To update your version of MSDN, you needed to install .NET. I have the feeling they're not dogfooding anymore. I'm looking for alternatives.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Are we only talking about engineering in a programming sense, or engineering in general?

For example, I'm sure I could find a million examples of good engineering that isn't beautiful. Often times what is useable isn't beautiful. Especially the commonplace things. Most serious bikers (not motorcycles) would prefer a mountain bike over a stunt bike, because while the stunt bike is more beautiful, its not the best engineered.

And then in coding examples, the most efficient way to write something in Perl probably isn't going to be beautiful. The thing can be said about just about any other language. But that's why we have APIs and encapsulation, so the end-user has no idea if the code that drives the API is ""beautiful"" or not, it just works.

Beauty is a subjective thing anyway. I think PHP is a hideous language visually, some people don't find anything wrong with it.

We have a fad that exists among programmers and designers today. They are so used to using languages like Java and seeing ugly websites over the past 10 years, that now there is a genuine push to make stuff that is attractive. The problem is when you start seeing people hitting that other extreme which is, ""I will only write *beautiful* code.""

Sorry guys. When I started working my intention was to write ""beautiful code"" (whatever that means). But tweaking my code for several hours to make it beautiful doesn't make economic sense, especially when the program works the same either way. If I was working on something like an open-source CMS that many people were going to be tweaking later on and it is something that I would be committing large amounts of time to, then this makes perfect sense. But when I'm in an environment that calls for me to write a small application and then go immediately to the next one, code beauty is the least of my worries.

And then we get back to that point where its not the attractiveness of the underlying code that matters, but rather the attractiveness of the API or interface that others will be using that really matters.",1143749828

Quoting from the link's quote of the transcript:

\tNo. I am talking about FISA, and is a President bound by the rules and regulations of FISA?

\tJudge Baker: If it is held constitutional and it is passed, I suppose, just like everyone else, he is under the law too.

\t***

\tSenator Feinstein: Judge?

\tJudge Stafford: Everyone is bound by the law, but I do not believe, with all due respect, that even an act of Congress can limit the President's power under the Necessary and Proper Clause under the Constitution.

\t***
\tChairman Specter: I think the thrust of what you are saying is the President is bound by statute like everyone else unless it impinges on his constitutional authority, and a statute cannot take away the President's constitutional authority. Anybody disagree with that?
----

Since the *law* was passed, (back in the 70's ? because of another Republican president abusing his powers), and has been used since that time, it is presumably passed and held constitutional.

I am unfamiliar with the Necessary and Proper clause. However, apparently in WW2 (a real war, against countries and not abstract nouns) when Truman tried to appropriate steel mills, the courts ruled his action unconstitutional. And there it wasn't the case that a law had been enacted specifically to regulate executive prerogative.

For the record, I think if take the Washington Times view of things (run by Sun Yung Moon, isn't it?) over the New York Times (which makes some big mistakes too) I believe you've already admitted you don't care that much for the truth.

"reddit.com","t5_6","So lately I have been thinking a lot about ""qualified experts,"" as mentioned in the article. Credentialism became prominent in the 20s because of advances in transportation technology. Before WWI everyone lived in the same town their whole lives, so anyone could vouch for you. Then after WWI there was increased mobility, so no longer could your neighbors provide the credibility needed to get a job or get startup funding. Thus college stepped up to fill the role of the middleman. This was essential to keep society functioning, although certainly credentialism hasn't done much for the learning aspect of college.

Today, however, we have the Internet. Everyone is linked to everyone and anyone can vouch for you. I can email the management of any company and assuming I follow basic email etiquette I can usually get a response. As digital identity  improves, everyone will be able to vouch for you based on the information you are supplying about yourself online. For example, PG has his essays and one of his books on his personal website. Surely this is as meaningful as a college degree. 

Also, college credentialism is a hierarchy because you have one person making value judgements about many people. Anyone who knows anything about network theory knows that networks are more powerful than hierarchies, because Metcalfe's law trumps Sarnoff's law. Thus college supplied credentialism is much less effective than what we are capable of reaching if we use the  Internet. This is why many of the ""qualified experts"" are so imcompetent, because hierarchies are so much weaker than networks.

Anyway, if someone wants to make a sh*tload of money I'd suggest developing some tools for the Internet that start to fill the credentialist role that colleges play currently. The value there will make the 2 billion Facebook is trying to get seem like peanuts. :-)",1143771468

The things that I do not like about Chomsky are: 

1) He is constantly puffed up as a great intellectual, but never submits any articles to peer-reviewed journals. I admit that while I am a polyglot, and am not a serious linguist, in my time working with linguistics I have found his work receives more adulation that seems appropriate. While he has had significant influence, especially in the U.S., his importance in linguistics gets puffed up because of his other political writings, and he engages in far too much self adulation - all this irritates me, but it is not enough to justify hating him. 

2) His rhetoric is incredibly grating after a while. His criticisms of US foreign policy while sometimes well founded, often verge on hysterics, and get extremely tedious after a few books. His repeat assertions that the US is at its root Fascist or Nazi, and that the US needs to go through 'denazification,' and his repeated comparison of the U.S. policy to that of Nazi Germany are rhetorically repulsive. On another rhetorically repulsive note, in the same way that he blathers on about his own self importance in his linguistic writings, he does the same in his political works. 

3) While I did have some reservations about the invasion of Afghanistan, they were focused on a concern that we would not follow through with rebuilding, and a concern that we might not adequately push for ensuring that human rights were respected by the new regime. I did not want to see the Taliban left unabated. Chomsky not only opposed any form of military action, but claimed that the US would starve millions of Afghanis, and would essentially engage in a form of genocide. 

4) Chomsky actually sided with the Republicans in criticizing the NATO intervention in Kosovo to stop the genocide occurring there. 

5) He has in the past defended Pol Pot, Maoist China, and other regimes that I find reprehensible. 

6) Chomsky has been repeatedly incredibly intellectually dishonest in his political writings when it served him. One example is in writing about UN ambassador Daniel Moynahan. He was no angel, but Chomsky selectively misquoted him, and attributed false quotes to him to make him appear to be someone who delighted in Nazi tactics.

This is an incomplete list, but these taken together along with other concerns (I run into egregious stuff when I read his works, but I explicitly try to avoid him as much as possible now) are why I hate him.  He, like Michael Moore, serves the left poorly.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Normally this'd be too pedantic, but since the topic is efficiency: ""while 1:"" is faster. Try a loop with two statements in the body (a simple arithmetic operation and a break condition); the while 1: version should be about 40% faster. This happens because True is actually a variable, so the interpreter needs to look it up in the global namespace each time it is used. There's still a 40% difference with Psyco.

In the case of 1 vs True in loop headers, the difference might not be a big deal in practice (likely the loop body consumes most time, or the break condition can be placed in the loop header instead), but it does give a hint of one of the most important optimization tricks in Python, sadly missing from the article: **avoid references to global variables**. If you need to access a global variable in a tight loop, create a local copy of it; this way it will be fetched from the stack instead of the global namespace. This can make a huge difference. It can even make a difference with functions: a minimal loop calling the abs function once in each iteration, in my test, gets 20% faster when the local copy a = abs is called instead.

On the topic of optimizing loops: as surprising as it may sound, range is much faster than xrange for small ranges, possibly up to range(100) or so. And if you have nested loops, build lists of indices with range() prior to the loops. Matrix algorithms are the perfect example of where this is a good idea.

By the way, I prefer ""while 1:"" because it saves keystrokes :-) In addition, I somehow want to read ""while True:"" as ""while the following block is true:"". I don't get that urge with the 1.",1143794249

"reddit.com","t5_6","I think **mkc** makes a number of good points, especially 2-4. I wish I had the link, but one of the better, balanced critiques of the current patent system I've read traces the explosion in the number of patents granted to a change in how the patent office is funded (i.e. now self-funding).

As well, although I'll admit there is a lot of vitriol about SW patents, I think it's more rhetoric than investigation to imply that anyone who disagrees with your viewpoint is an uninformed reactionary.

I would say that SCO, and the recent RIM settlement over Blackberry indicates that the ""chilling"" effect of the current patent atmosphere is not trivial. I can tell you in the telco business that all product ideas have to go through a patent clearing, and the fear level is also non-trivial.

If the major point of the essay is, ""Too many trivial patents are granted"" then I'll agree heartily. I also agree that companies need to play along (i.e. file for their own patents). I've gotten a few for my company too, and hopefully for some things that aren't trivial. (On the other hand, I don't think there's anything there that someone couldn't think of in less than 20 years of looking at the problem!)

But I also take issue with the, ""SW is different, because we're so clever, even when we tell other people how to do it, they can't."" This reeks of hubris.

So, all in all, I'm not too impressed with the essay. What about the cost of getting rid of invalid patents? What about all the out-of-court manoeuvering we don't hear about? What about the possibility of patents with a shorter life span?

"reddit.com","t5_6","This is exactly the same thing I was thinking of when coming to the last third of this essay. I am suspecting the author avoids this issue because if he was conceding here, the whole point of ""software patents are just like other patents"" becomes moot. There is at least one area where the current system of patents can not very easily replaced by another system of checks and balances, and that is pharmacy. Even during the development process, the companiy will have to have publicised the substance to every possible harmful aspect of it, and has still years of clinical research ahead before the first dollar of revenue can be cashed in. 

Software companies are secretive to a large degree. Most don't even hand out the source code along with the binaries they sell. Some wouldn't publish their implemented algorithm (*cough* venue of PG's speech *cough*). What more would these companies withhold if software couldn't be patented?",1143811651

I think having Congress review their justification is in fact exactly what needs to be done. This current state is entirely a result of unlegislated judicial decisions that appear to have no basis in serving the public good or the economy. What is you basis for believing their equivalence? I can almost guarantee you it is not based on extensive conversations with patent lawyers.",1143812194
"reddit.com","t5_6","I really enjoyed your essays enormously, but I can't agree with this
one.

It is probably true, that the current practice isn't as malicious as
the proponents of the anti-software-patents movement make us
think. And most certainly patents have found a role in the VC
business. But how could they have not? They are part of the assets,
and thats what aquisitions are about.

But then you go, and claim, that without patents, everything would be
kept secret. And that assertion goes without any evidence, except some
contrieved middle-ages analogy. Why should it be so?  I'm not
convinced at all. And that's the main grounds upon which you justify
the current practice. That's close to troll bait.

The main problem, and which causes all the confusion about
intellectual property and patents is in fact the property
analogy. Before intellectual property, there was just property. You
had real-estate, a house, and so many acres of land, and that was
yours. If in doubt, or trouble with you neighbour: get a surveyor, he
would consult the triangles and the cadastre.

What can you do, when in doubt about IP? It's not measurable. This
leads to legal uncertainty, and it ultimalty just feeds lawyers. Watch
IBM struggle with SCO, and that's just an obvious case.

There are command economies (communism, feudalism) and free ones. In
the free one nobody commands everything, but everybody commands a bit,
but that bit needs to be tracked explicitly. Property is needed to
decide who controls what, decebtrally, in a free system. It reduces
risk (and costs) of conflict here. Property of tanglible assets is a
necessity in the free system of capitalism, and it makes it efficient. I can't fully use your house, your farm or your plant while you use it.

The opposite is true of knowledge. I can use your knowledge without
you losing anything, but I gain wealth. There's the magic. Nothing
gets more efficient because you cheat government into denying me to
use what you know. To the contrary, things get really messy
when you try to bring demarcations into the ""field"" of
knowledge. Intellectual property is simply an inapt analogy to tangible property.

You're probably right to advise startups to build up defensive portfolios of IP.
Agreed. The distinction between the two question (""should I patent?""
and: ""patents at all?"") is a good one.  But you shouldn't excuse the
whole patents practice on such shallow grounds.

These are basically the guys you want to hang out with if you are starting a startup. But even within YPO there is convergance of talent at a certain level. What happens is that instead of having one big network that is suitable for all types of people, the online social networks of today are stratified and somewhat hierarchical. For example, Facebook &gt; MySpace.

Anyway, until we figure out how to create a social network that doesn't alienate people at the high end and attract sycophants at the low end then we should separate the credentialist aspect from the social networking aspect. The great thing about these types of projects is that they are a joke from the technical side.

UK politicians believe to a man that they need the backing of Murdoch's papers to succeed and any potential PM will negotiate their support (whatever it takes).

All I really need to hear from someone who is a proponent of patents (but is pretending to be impartial) is this:

&gt;In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money, and once you have money, people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not. So I advise fatalism. Don't waste your time worrying about patent infringement. You're probably violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces.

This is a system worth keeping? That makes no sense at all.

Also, the argument about patents being needed so people will publish how they code things up is bogus. Plenty of people publish algorithms anyway WITHOUT patents.

The current demonstrations by students of French universities against a proposed liberalization of the labor laws, so that it will be easier for French employers to hire and fire young people, remind me very much of the strike by miners on the Witwatersrand in South Africa in 1922.

The demonstrators in France and the strikers in South Africa are and were supported by their respective national communist parties. The miners went on strike because the mine-owners proposed to replace expensive white labor with cheap black labor, hoping to increase profits. This move provoked one of the most bizarre political slogans of all time, promoted by the communist party: **Workers of the World Unite for a White South Africa!**

The second problem is justifying how a software patent, which could run on any general processor, is the same as a device. That is, unless you have a nano-assembler that could make any device with a spec. 

Copyrights exist for implementations. Hardware patents exist for designs of a device. So where do you draw the line between a software patent and copyright. By Specificity? If your spec if specific enough to be the software, then its an implementation, covered by copyright. If not, not then its likely very broad, and probably bad. 

I still see algorithms as discovered, much like theories, in the math sense. 

In other scope: business method patents seem like pure hogwash. There is nothing similar to patents about that. Its purely an idea, and shouldn't be patentable. Why?

"reddit.com","t5_6","He uses the term denazification in a few works, but the most famous instance is in ""American Power and the New Mandarins,"" which I encourage you to read thoroughly.  That was actually the work that pushed me over the edge in my opinions of Chomsky, who I really wanted to like, since I am a good hearted liberal intellectual type.  I could not fid it online (I heard he now posts all his stuff, but a cursory search did not locate it), and no longer own a copy, so I can't give you a page number, but you can Google it and find a large number of cites.

With respect to publications, I may well be wrong, since I first noted the issue back in '99, and it's not something I follow or care about, so he might have submitted an article to a peer-reviewed journal since then.  I did another cursory search and did not find anything, but since I am no longer in academia, I might not be using the appropriate resources.  I think it would be easy to show me an example of an article on linguistics that has been submitted to a peer reviewed journal to prove me wrong. That Wikipedia article does not make any case for your assertion.

With respect to his pride, his writing and speaking skills are irrelevant.  Indeed he is a great speaker, and I have been very impressed the few times that I saw him.  He is also a really good writer, especially when he writes about politics.  He writes clearly and is very engaging.  But the impressions I got of his self adulation were what I got. Honestly I am not going to slog though that crap again on your behalf, especialy since I have sold off all my Chomsky books.  The sense I got of it was stronger in his academic writings, but were there in his political writings too.  Perhaps since I only read a limited selection of his work I got the wrong impression.  On a side note I do know a few linguists who are very critical of his academic work and his person (who originally pointed out the issue with his publications), perhaps that has biased me, though perhaps if you view him critically some works might be read in a different light where his triumphalism would be more apparent.

Whether he indulges in overweening pride or not, I could have expanded my concerns about Chomsky quite a lot if you would like, as I had more to say.  I was trying to be terse, since I know that few read long posts.

A questions for you, what do you have to say about him defending Pol Pot?

In the morning my brother Emile (ten years my senior) came into my bedroom and said: ""Well, Raymond, today is April Fool's Day, and I will fool you as you have never been fooled before!"" I waited all day long for him to fool me, but he didn't. Late that night, my mother asked me, ""Why don't you go to sleep?"" I replied, ""I'm waiting for Emile to fool me."" My mother turned to Emile and said, ""Emile, will you please fool the child!"" Emile then turned to me, and the following dialogue ensued:

[FURTHER UPDATE: &lt;a href=""http://reddit.com/info?id=3r0h#c3r3n""&gt;Someone&lt;/a&gt; over at reddit notes that there are now 11 neg reviews, and guesses that between 3 and 9 of the one-star reviews are due to the reddit posting. As the most pessimistic case assume that there are only 2 legit ones. That gives a result of .15384615^2 or 0.02366864; still below the usual statistical limit of .05 that leads the rejection an assumption (null hypothesis). So, as a statistical test, the conclusion stands even under the harshest numerical criticism I've received. 

However, I do now wish I had counted the suspicious ones instead of forming a rush impression before doing my initial calculation. It's a nuisance that people are focusing on the extreme number I calculated, when it really isn't necessary to be that extreme for deriving the statistically valid conclusion, and it IS probable that at least a couple of those reviews were due to reddit. I'd change the calc now, but there are already a lot of links out there so I think I should just leave it.]",1143828135

Consider two mutually exclusive hypothesies A and B, and some piece of evidence E

Now, from the rules of conditional probability, we can easily get the following:

P(A|E)/P(B|E) = P(E|A)/P(E|B) * P(A)/P(B)

In other words, the odds ratio of hypothesis A being true vs hypothesis B being true given observed evidence E is the likelyhood ratio of E (that is, the ratio of the probabilities that E would have been observed given A was true vs given B was true) multiplied by the prior odds ratio.

So evidence E favors hypothesis A, ie, the left side of the equation is larger than the prior ratio P(A)/P(B), if and only if P(E|A) &gt; P(E|B)

Okay so far?

Now, multiply both sides of that criteria by -1 (of course fliping the &gt; to &lt; along the way)

So we have -P(E|A) &lt; -P(E|B)

No problem so far, right?

add 1 to both sides.

1 - P(E|A) &lt; 1 - P(E|B)

hrm........ given any particular state, the total probability of something happening or not happening = 1.

so now we have

P(~E|A) &lt; P(~E|B)

That is, the probability of not E given A is less then the probability of not E given B.

But wait...

That's basically the criteria needed for ~E to favor B vs A.

Therefore absence of evidence _IS_ evidence of absense.

http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_VGGTVSQ

In short, what they are saying is that there are two classes, and that that's not fair.  Of course, they don't take the position that everyone should have jobs for life as the protesters want, but that rather, the protesters, being young and presumably eager to work would have a better shot at things if their elders weren't lodged in jobs that it is impossible to pry them out of.

That's certainly true in Italy, where there are laws like the one in france that create less protected jobs.  As a small example, take two people:

My wife is working on her doctorate at the University.  Like PhD students everywhere, she isn't paid well, doesn't have much in the way of benefits, and were she to, say, get pregnant, she would be out on her ass in no time flat.  Don't let the PhD part fool you though - her contract is, legally, the basic 'flexible, no protection' variety.

Her friend, on the other hand, was hired at a ""Real Job"" about a year ago.  Not too long after, she and her husband conceived, and the baby was born in January.  She left work a few months before the event, and, when we went to visit her recently, said that she probably won't go back until September.  She wouldn't want to leave her baby somewhere in July, when she would be eligible to go back to work, just to have to keep it at home again in August (when everything shuts down and everyone goes on vacation, like it or not), only to have to take the baby back to the care center again in September...  It would be so traumatic...  Yes, she got 3 months of that paid at full wages, and the rest at something like 70%.

Do you see some inequity there?  Guess who's paying for who, in general terms, to take her cushy year off of work?  Guess why companies generally try and avoid women of child-bearing age like the plague for ""Real Jobs""?

There are two models that seem to work pretty well:

1) The anglo-saxon model, despite its problems, is more or less meritocratic, modulo a monkey-man or two as president.    It can be a bit harsh at times, but it does work for a lot of people (things like health care could use some tweaking, though).

2) The nordic model, where companies are free to hire and fire according to their needs, but there is a strong state that will take care of you if you fall on bad times.  This is paid for by society at large through very high taxes, but at least it's paid for by everyone.

In Italy, the state doesn't do much at all in terms of taking care of the unemployed (less than in the states, as far as what I can figure out, except that of course you get health care), so people get really scared about clinging to jobs - surveys continue to indicate that a majority of even young people would prefer a stable, boring job to their dream job if the dream job were risky.

More companies might have software that ran only on their computers, and everyone who interacted with the software would be NDAd.

[File type icon near title for non-HTML links](http://features.reddit.com/info?id=3rdv)",1143841283
"reddit.com","t5_6","Hmmm. Where to start.

First of all, written Chinese has very little to do with spoken Chinese. Mandarin is a spoken language. The written 'equivalent' does indeed have thousands of characters and a rich history (see, for example, the excellent 'Swallowing Clouds' by A. Zee for some of the history intertwined with cooking tidbits) but the spoken language is quite different.

When travelling in China last year we noticed there were significant differences in speaking patterns and word use between Beijing and, for example, Kunming in Sechuan. Mandarin is an 'attempt' at a universal chinese spoken language but it has only been partially succesful - much like there were very different versions of English until the mass media began wiping Cockney and Franglais and... off the map. 

Learning to speak the language is very very hard since the phonemes are quite different. However, you could learn to write it without speaking a word, since they are not phonetic / symbolic equivalents like English or most IndoEuropean languages are. Learning to write it is apparently even harder (my kids and wife learned it, I gave up) because as you say of the thousands of characters with highly specific contextual semantics.

The article was talking largely about the spoken language; you could learn to speak it and use the Pinyin phoneticized language or a variant to type it without using traditional characters.

That doesn't exactly jibe with the lofty claim, ""We encourage all voices to respond openly in our store, both positive and negative... we wholeheartedly support the right to free speech.""  

This kind of bullshit is pretty much standard corporate practice, but IMHO companies that engage in it deserve all the costs and bad publicity they get -- especially since Amazon profits a great deal from the reviews people provide them for free.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I was browsing the legal section during lunch on a very productive day, and I came across a book on passing the patent bar.  I'm not especially interested in doing this, but I was curious enough to read a bit.

Apparantly, you have to have either an accredited degree in a branch of science or engineering, or a certain amount of coursework in sci/eng, to qualify to sit for the exam (or pass the FE exam... there may be a few others).

Then came a list of courses that *don't* qualify you for the patent bar.  Guess what's on it?  Mathematics courses.  A Ph.D in math does not qualify to become a patent agent!

I suppose this means a math Ph.D doesn't qualify to review patents, either.  A civil engineer who has written a bit of fortran does qualify, but a math major doesn't.

The historical context does make a bit of sense.  Like Paul wrote, algorithms were not to be patented.  Only mechanical inventions, grounded in physical science, were patentable.  While math and physical sciences are closely related, math wasn't patentable.  So I guess it made sense that mathematicians weren't allowed to be members of the patent bar.

But algorithms are clearly patentable now.  Unfortunately, the patent bar isn't just failing to identify the best people to evaluate these patents - they have specifically, deliberately excluded them!

No wonder it's such mess.  I can see two reasons for this.  

1) the people who run the patent bar are idiots.
2) the people who run the patent bar are brilliant, and are cynically manipulating the system.

A cartel will reliably take actions to increase demand and restrict supply.  Allowing alorithms to be patented increases demand.  Allowing mathematicians to become members, on the other hand, increases supply.

Allow algorithms to be patented, but pretend you haven't. Bingo.",1143844674
"reddit.com","t5_6","That's overly harsh. If I had known this would get attention as something serious I would have spent more time on it and that wouldn't have gotten by. I explicitly stated that it was ""for our amusement"" for chrissake!!!! Now that it is being taken seriously, I stand behind the updated blog post, which I think reasonable people will judge to come to the same end conclusion with regard to a statistically significant result as the unupdated one.

I'll paste some text here from where I responded to Josh's comments on my blog:


Josh: it just seems so unlikely, though, if you read the reviews. I don't think the ones who were specific and give evidence of having read the book actually went out and read it due to reddit, OR that they were lying. Another possibility is that they had already read the book, and reddit convinced them to post a review. That too seems to me to be very unlikely.

So yes, I concede your point, but I still think that if we want to use the data to judge whether Amazon is tilted against one-star reviews, it's more reasonable to say that those possibilities are too unlikely to matter much.

Particularly since, weighed against those arguments that tell us to give the benefit of the doubt to Amazon, there is Brian's actual experience where they DID repeatedly reject his one-star review. If we're going to weigh in the pro-amazon arguments, shouldn't we weight that in too? But we can't. I think the approach I have taken is reasonable as a middle ground.


Usually in statistics a sample size of 2 is not enough to generate statistical significance. For instance, if you want to know whether a coin is weighted toward giving heads and you throw it twice and get heads both times, the probability of that is .25.

The cutoff for something to be called ""statistically significant"" is usually .05 (see for instance http://www.surveysystem.com/signif.htm). This is usually called the ""alpha-level""

The die example above therefore does not reach statistical significance. In most real-world cases, a small handful of cases do not result in statistical significance. So there's a vague sense in the common wisdom that you need more cases for significance.

But actually, the question is whether the alpha-level of .05 is attained or not, and it doesn't matter what the sample size is if it is attained.

 But I reiterate what I said before. This is NOT a rigorous finding, for reasons discussed in our earlier exchange.

Reading Chinese involves learning to recognize around 5000 characters, which is somewhat easier than it sounds because most characters recycle the same 300 or so ""pieces"".  Most characters are composed out of two to five of them, which makes identification somewhat like reading a two- to five-lettered word, though of course pronunciation is only hinted at, if at all.

Writing Chinese, interestingly enough, has been made almost trivial by technology, if by writing we mean typing.
