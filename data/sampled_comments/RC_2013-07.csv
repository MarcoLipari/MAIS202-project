"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I figured out a specialization quite early on. We focus on supporting Drupal and WordPress for micro-businesses and small not-for-profits in the UK.

You're right that we could perhaps specialize further. When we first started, we used to do Drupal only and not many people had heard of it. Now there are lots of people doing the same thing.

I should definitely spend more time networking and that's probably my biggest lapse. We get so busy sometimes that I don't have the chance to connect with others to look for new business and this is what leads to the 'famines' after big projects.

This is why I was wondering if pay-per-lead services would be a viable option.","1372636801"

If symptoms had shown themselves just a few years later they might have been passed off as ""normal teenage reactions to hormones"" or something similar, and I might have had to go through all my teen years feeling like everyone would be better off if I was dead. Teenagers can and do have feelings that have nothing to do with puberty.

But I'm talking about people who actually have a chemical imbalance that causes anxiety, depression, etc. If they think they have depression because they feel sad sometimes and have never actually seen a doc about it, they can go flush their heads in a toilet.","1372636801"

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","I used to work for a homelessness organization. A couple things that aren't noted in the article:

* The 2009 numbers were altered from their initial publication. An error was discovered in how families recieving CalWORKs benefits were counted. What's interesting about this is... before the correction, 2011 would have represented an *increase*, not a *decrease* in homelessness. Meanwhile, the ""decrease"" reported in the official 2009 Homeless Count was smaller than touted, or perhaps nonexistent (I haven't gone back to check the 2007 numbers). This correction was not revealed until the 2011 Homeless Count was published, and it was not completely explained until people confused about why the 2009 count changed asked LAHSA for clarification.

* The Recovery Act of 2009 included funding for a program called the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing Program (HPRP... don't ask me where the other R went). This was a highly cost-effective program, which also had demonstrated effectiveness in preventing or reducing homelessness. It was available to all people who were homeless or facing homelessness (but some organizations prioritized families). At an average cost, nationally, of $2,200 per family, hundreds of thousands of people were either stabilized in housing or re-housed within days or weeks of becoming homeless. Funding for that program ran out in late 2011 in Los Angeles (EDIT: no, it was August 2012 actually, though most of it was expended by January 2012). The local replacement, the Family Solutions Centers, are available ONLY to households with children, and just started up in late 2012 (EDIT: actually I think it was February 2013). The adult household version isn't expected to come online until late this year or early next year. (BTW, the veterans program they mentioned, SSVF [Supportive Services for Veteran Families], is modeled closely on HPRP.)

In other words... this is a completely predictable result of local slowness in implementing ""what works"". Mike Arnold, head of LAHSA and quoted in the article, has a long history of blaming service providers for being unable to turn sow's ears into silk purses, asking organizations to achieve 65% permanent housing placement with $20/day/person funding (for complete room and board, plus case management, hygiene supplies, and referrals to supportive services and housing placements. In less than 90 days).

Edit to add: 

[The total number of homeless people](http://www.lahsa.org/homelesscount.asp) counted in Los Angeles County in the 2007 count was 73,702. The published 2009 count was 48,053. The published 2011 count was 51,340, but the 2009 count was revised in that publication to 52,931. With the revised numbers, that says there was a 28% year-over-year drop, rather than a 35% drop indicated by the original 2009 number.

Many service providers expressed extreme skepticism when the 2009 count was published; their experience didn't match a huge drop in demand. Also of note is that between the 2007 and 2009 counts, LAHSA switched consultants for the count... from a California-based organization to a UNC Chapel Hill group. Some folks supect that people on the East Coast are less likely to understand the nuances of Los Angeles demography and homelessness.","1372636803"

People shouldn't do what police officers say because they are police officers and you should do everything police officers say but because they have a badge and a uniform and these insignia symbolize the law (which is the only thing that should be followed). 

I mean, even if a police officer busts into your home with his weapon drawn and yells ""get your ass on the floor"" that's already  unacceptable. It asserts authority through coercion rather than the law. In the US it has come so far that asking ""Why?"" rather than doing what the officer just told you will end with you getting tasered or shot or at the very least simply assaulted.

If a police officer shoots someone and it turns out that was a bad call, it's simply murder. If a police officer is shot then it's just murder. If a police officer provides his testimony in court, it's worth just as much as anyone else's. 

If a police officer doesn't identify himself clearly with a badge and a number always visible on his back as well as his chest, no authority should be assumed. If you are unarmed and detained the police officer detaining you must be able to explain to you why he is detaining you otherwise you should be free to go and you should be able to sue the officer in question.

Using weapons able to apply deadly force or even ""just"" tasers or pepperspray should be an absolutely last resort used only if there is due reason to assume there is immediate threat to health and/or property.

Secondly: Hand out immediate and draconian punishment for abusing authority in any way whatsoever.    
In countries like Germany you can usually assume there will always be a full investigation for a police officer just *firing* a weapon (without even hitting anyone). In the US the police kills people on a daily basis and no bother even asking questions.

&gt; I'm saying that people who want to join and do good and change things for the better shouldn't be discouraged by people like you saying that they are just delusional.

No, they don't change anything for the better. They are just doing their job the way it should be done anyway. That there are many people that don't do it that way is the problem.


&gt; You're implying that there will most likely have to be a period of anarchy.

Yes. Your point? The point is revolution. Which is long overdue in the US. Often that comes with short periods of anarchy. ","1372636808"

Stop and take note of where you are for a second or two. Often the decision will be quite clear based on what has happened.

---

You just killed a base, or held his pressure after being a base up - ""I need to deny his future bases, because I'm one base up NOW"" - Time to macro up and stay safe with strong information! 

You can choose to attack with the remaining units you used to defend, if you wish. Another decision that can come from this is ""I've pressured with the leftover units I used to defend, and I did lots of damage!"" - This could be a time to continue your aggression. Something that comes to mind is a 12 Roach opener vs Terran, maybe you do enough damage to crush him if you reinforce with Roaches.

You just traded with his army nicely - ""I need to tech switch as he doesn't have an answer for my current tech (I have Hydras vs DT opener, he needs to add Colossi so I can add Mutas)"" - Time to take another base, add tech and attack shortly!

You have to cut a straw to the right length &amp; fit it tightly on the adapter stem, and you'll want to change straws fairly regularly, especially if using clear ones. And every time you need to load it up again or turn it off or whatever, you must remove the lid to the soda, then carefully take out the Solo. 

But that isn't to say it doesn't come in handy, one of my best times with the Solo was whilst hiking with a friend, vaping from the thing in the soda adapter. We even had a container that fit alongside the Solo in the cup, making it super easy to load up new bowls. Suffice to say we used up a full charge that day, and vaped a hell of a lot of weed to boot.

The guard dropped to the ground like a mummer's puppet with the strings cut. Blood and wine mixed together before being sucked down into the thirsty Dothraki Sea. *What a waste of good wine,* Tyrion thought, before pulling back the string and notching another bolt.

Daario ducked under one of the flaps. He carried an empty platter, and was laughing to himself. But he stopped when he saw the body. ""What?"" He reached for his sword, but the bolt caught him in the chest before he could draw them. The air whistled out of his chest as the blood bubbled on his leather jerkin. Tyrion stepped over him and into the tent.

"watercooling","t5_2r01v","Just to add, you'll have to be careful when filling this loop if you separate the pumps by a decent distance.  I would recommend picking up two reservoir/pump combos, this would make things both a lot easier and would add redundancy.  You can attach one of the reservoir/pump combos directly to the radiator using something like a [UN Mount](http://www.undesignsbrackets.com/).  To fill the loop, fill the first reservoir/pump (the one before the GPU blocks) and pulse that.  The tubing coming out from the GPUs should ideally be connected to the second reservoir by the radiator, that way the water it will flow directly into it and be above the pump at all times.  This should prevent the second pump from ever running dry, no matter where the radiator is placed.  Once the second reservoir has filled, you can simply continue to pulse both pumps until everything has been filled and bled nicely, should be pretty painless.

Now the issue with that setup is the wiring really.  But considering you want the fans over there anyway, connecting a pump up won't be an issue.  If anything you could just make a long-ass extension cable.

Oh and running the GPUs in parallel would definitely be a good idea.  It takes a bit more pump grunt but that won't be an issue as noise isn't a concern.  It should help to reduce and even out temperatures across all cards nicely.  Just grab an EK parallel bridge for quadGPU setups, easily the simplest and cheapest option given your GPU block choice. As much as I love Crystal link and it's fittings, don't bother here.  They're purely aesthetic and you'd need a lot of fittings for a quad GPU setup.

**Edit:** [Here's the GPU Bridge](http://www.frozencpu.com/products/18975/ex-blc-1423/EK_Terminal_Block_-_Quad_Parallel_-_Black_Acetal_EK-FC_Terminal_QUAD_Semi-Parallel.html?tl=g30c101s873) I was talking about.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Legally speaking you have every right not to give blood.  We respect this right every day when we watch those in need of organ donation die while compatible donors stand in the same room.  For your analogy to be consistent we would have to create forced organ donation.

An almost identical parallel is seen with marrow donation.  First, the donor agrees to the procedure.  The recipient prepares by taking a course of radiation to kill the diseased marrow.  Once this is done they *must* get new marrow or almost certainly die (they have literally no immune system).  At this point the donor still has the right to refuse to donate.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","&gt;For me at least witnessing an emotion response from someone will elicit a similar but less intense feeling from me. This seems more prevalent in those that indulge/embrace thier emotions more than restrain/mask them.

You are talking about sympathy, not empathy.

""I feel bad because you feel bad"" is sympathy.

""I understand why you feel bad and how you're feelings were hurt, even though my feelings aren't hurt"" is empathy. 

I have not found any evidence that women are better at either one of those things. When it comes to empathy, some of the response to [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1dvulj/women_of_askmen_yes_you_read_that_right_whats_the/) kind of shocked me.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute

Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days

Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool

And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school

When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood

I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way

She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.

Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?

Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?

I don't think so

I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out

I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here

I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror

If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'

I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

"RATS","t5_2qnh3","The first time in the cage is going to depend a bit on their stress level, but usually it's a good idea to give them at least the first 24 hours to get used to their cage and become comfortable there. After that point, you can take them out and handle them, or keep the cage door open and allow them to come out.

You'll want to tailor your interactions a bit to their level of comfort, and basically try to make every interaction a ""successful"" one. Success generally means that the rats didn't panic or get to a real stressed state, so if they are fine coming out and being handled but get upset after a minute, try to end the handling session just before that point. Each time you handle them, try to extend the time a little bit longer as they acclimate.

I've also found that it helps if you keep the cage in an area where they can see and smell you, in an area that you're going to be frequently in the house. In a lot of houses, that's the living room where everyone is hanging out, but it might be your kitchen or bedroom too.

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","Ok, as a chick, i feel bad for your girl. Wow, man. Only blowjobs get you hard? 

I'm sure she finds sex with you pretty mechanical. ""three strokes up, two down, lick, lick (god this tastes awful, feels demeaning, brings back bad memories, i just don't like it, this really turns me off but if I ever want to have sex I gotta do it,) lick, finally penetrative sex that is enjoyable! 

Or, like happened to you, ""For Christ sake, I HATE giving blowjobs, but he keeps freakin asking knowing god-damn good and well I hate it. What a jerk! It isn't worth it. I'm done."" 

Its such a turn-on when a guy starts whining and complaining like a little kid. ""What's the big deal?! I haven't asked in weeks!"" It's like a 5-year-old whining at the grocery store check-out. 

*NEWSFLASH* She doesn't like it. That's probably a big deal to her. You think a clit to the nose is inconvenient, how about a bratwurst down your throat with hair on the end? But you keep pushing the issue - then call it a non-issue. I'd get defensive, too. 

Do you trim? Are you clean? Have you asked her *outside the bedroom* why she is uncomfortable with oral sex? Have *you* considered looking for alternatives you *both* enjoy and finding new and different erogenous zones? Instead of treating your girlfriend's mouth like a masturbation toy (predictable, the same thing over and over you know gets you off) try exploring a little. Geeze.  ","1372636832"

"Jazz","t5_2qmm6","There are two aspects of your problem I'd like to address.

First, instead of using recording as a tool to help you get better, you have subconsciously used it as a measure of your self worth. Instead of ""Oh, that bit was bad. What can I do to fix that?"", the dialog in your head is going ""Why has my playing got no soul? I've been playing for such I long time, I've learned this and this and this, it should be there by now..."" and so forth.

The solution is to listen to the recording with the attitude of a doctor. Perceive what isn't working right, come up with solutions, and have a lot of compassion. If the doctor involved their ego in any way i.e. it was about them rather than the patient, the doctor wouldn't be able to do their job as effectively. Treat your recordings the same way. Now, this isn't easy to do and takes some practising to listen carefully for mistakes and listen with compassion.

Second, separate practising from playing. When you play, accept and actively love every sound you make. This can't be conditional. It has to be all encompassing. A three year old kid would probably enjoy themselves immensely playing the drums, even though from a technical standpoint it is terrible. Be that three year old kid. Whether you are grooving or not grooving. Whether the kit is tuned properly or badly. And so forth.

This takes a while to get into this mindset, especially if you are into the habit of criticizing yourself every time you play. But if you do this 5 minutes everyday, you'll begin to relate to your instrument in a new way. Heck, you might find yourself enjoying playing again.

I've used these ideas for around 4 months now, and I absolutely enjoy playing the piano these days, even moreso than when I was really obsessed 7/8 years ago. And when I find frustration creeping in, I revisit these ideas and I begin to have fun again.","1372636835"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Swain's powerful, but he has a relatively short range, and has to get very close to enemy champions for his full burst. He has a lot of lane-clear potential later on, especially with an ultimate with only an 8 second cooldown.

Swain does quite a bit of damage over time instead of one massive burst. So keep that in mind when you use him. Many players get disappointed when they can't Ahri someone down to 0 at point blank.

You'll want to max out his E by level 9, taking a rank in W and Q by level 4. His W is a slow, and does some damage. It's not the most impressive move he has, but it can be useful. Namely to prepare for his W. His W is an AoE root with a high startup. If you hit a target with your Q, you can slow them down enough to prep them for your W, dealing a pretty good amount of damage and keeping them in place for your E if you haven't cast it already. It's important to also note that his E also increases all damage done by Swain to the afflicted target, as long as Swain's crow remains on the foe and damages them over time. It's also his primary source of damage and harass.

His R is amazing for sustain and lane clear, but don't keep it up for extended periods of time. He turns into a giant crow, shooting out several crows that damage the surrounding enemies (requiring you to be relatively close to them to do damage, unfortunately). It does prioritize champions, but the targets are semi-random, so you may be disappointed with the results in a team fight if you want to focus one target over another. But each crow that hits also gives Swain a certain amount of HP back per hit. It can save your life, and increases your move speed. If you need to clear a wave out quickly, dropping his W on a grouped up set of minions and following up with a 2 second R will help to clear it out- if not completely doing so by itself.

His mana costs are, sadly, pretty damn high. His passive allows him to get a certain amount of mana back each time he kills something, so last hitting with Swain is essential to not only farming, but sustaining his lane.

I typically like to build a Tear of the Goddess fairly fast to help me get some more mana as the game goes on. Building that into an Archangel Staff also helps to get some of that extra mana a bit faster, and it keeps him alive a bit longer once it reaches Seraph's Embrace. Abyssal Rod or Rylai's Crystal Scepter both help, depending on the circumstances. Liandry's will also be useful on Swain, as two of his abilities have movement impairing CC.  I also recommend getting a Rabaddon's Deathcap (an obvious choice for an AP caster) and a Zhonya's Hourglass (it can really save your bacon if you decide to run into a group of enemies at a bad time, and the extra armor is nice).

Swain can be a lot of fun, but you might be disappointed in him depending on the roles you regularly play.","1372636846"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","There's a point you reach that you know when games are lost. Dragging it past that point til where you have a slim chance of winning is not enjoyable. There are some games where you can turn it around but that's usually late game, if you are only at 20min in and getting stomped on, there generally isn't much point in continuing. People, i would say Gold elo and better, generally capitalizes on mistakes and continues to do use that foward momentum to take control of the map. Why drag a game on which you have to turtle and slowly suffer a defeat with a very very slim chance of winning. 

Other ELO tier players generally make a lot of mistakes even after getting an advantage. Overextending, not warding, 3vs1 or any variant. This pretty much allows the enemy team to come back into the game.

If you are losing by a few thousand gold early game it's alright. Once you hit close to the 10K overall gold difference; your game is pretty much done. It's really hard to make up that much gold unless the enemy team is really stupid. Late game however, 10K gold difference amounts to nothing when most people have near full build.","1372636847"

""But that's when it starts getting good!"" you scream, but I'd rather not waste my time with an author who doesn't know how to make an interesting first half.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The writing itself is absurdly distracting and painfully boring. I stopped 50 pages in and didn't look back until I had seen every movie release. My friends gave me endless amounts of shit for this. Same argument, it gets better. I was really missing out on the great literary work of my generation.

Anything bigger runs into the problem of rapidly spiraling development cost and the associated risks.  In order to ever recover the development cost, manufacturers must sell a lot of units.  For airlines to be interested, the plane needs to be profitable per seat, ie. bigger capacity.  But bigger planes cost more to develop and use more energy to get to cruise and so on.  No one has been able to find the sweet spot of profit for both buyer and seller and it likely won't happen anytime soon as long as SSTs are using multiple times the fuel per passenger mile of subsonics.  

The comparatively very conventional A380 has still not hit the break even point yet and it offers the best seat per mile cost of any plane on it's routes. If form holds and the airline industry doesn't suffer another big hit, the A380 will break even and turn a long term profit but the situation underscores the main issue.  It costs a lot of money and if you guess the market wrong the costs can bury you.","1372636850"

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","Came here to say that. I make my dog homemade treats and had to add garlic because he had a flea problem when I first got him that wasn't being adequately handled with just pills and baths. Garlic supposedly causes anemia in pets but that has been challenged in recent years because of such insufficient evidence, or the effect is only seen if large quantities are ingested. If they don't eat the garlic for some reason (use fresh, not cooked for best/safest results), try brewers yeast in their food. Some people also put vinegar in the water bowls, but I've heard many say that you shouldn't put additives in water as they may become dehydrated if they refuse to drink it due to the taste/smell.","1372636855"

So the topic up there really isn't sex slaves, it's moving people. And when it comes to moving people I don't think you *need* a fancier title than human trafficking because it's not all an atrocity.

Obviously, I get upvotes for the LoD, but then again, everyone gets to bug the shit out of me for it, so I'd say it's at least PARTIALLY deserved.

If you look through my all-time top comments (at least the ones that show up -- Reddit needs to fix that shit), while some of them are quick one-liners, many are either stories or pretty long dissections of an inaccurate post title. Other times, I go down a rabbit hole because I get curious why something has happened. So, for example, if a Senator votes a certain way and the article is mocking him for it, I might try to figure out *why*. If there's a good reason, I'll write that up.

In that sense, I think I contribute to Reddit and to be really honest, I try to make this a better place. I don't downvote people for disagreeing with me, I don't flame, I don't troll, and if someone leaves me a response, about 95% of the time I respond.

I'd like to think that consistency has helped contribute to my visibility, but who knows? The biggest advantage for me in commenting here is that it helps improve the clarity of my writing.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","You can't change it.  There is no scientific evidence that you can change your sexuality. The only people who think you can change it are religious people who think it is bad.  They are totally wrong though.

There is nothing wrong with you.

There are millions and millions of LGBT people in the world.  It is normal in the same way that being 6'5"" is normal.  Most people are a lot shorter than 6'5"", but being 6'5"" is OK. There is no reason for a really tall person to try and be 5'10"". They should just embrace being tall. Yeah, they will have to be careful about walking through doorways, but it isn't the end of the world. And, there are some advantages to being 6'5"".

Yes. There are some advantages to being gay. Sure, there is discrimination and shitty people and homophobia and all that crap. But there are some super-cool things about being gay!  It was really hard for me to come to terms with that but there are some really liberating things about it.

I'd suggest trying to get some LGBT friends. I can pretty much guarantee they won't be like the narrow stereotypes you see on TV.

Not that there is anything particularly WRONG with the stereotypical stuff, it is just that you'll see three-dimensional people.

For example, I love Kylie Minogue. I love the Sunday Styles section of the New York Times. I love drag and drag queens.  So those are some of the ""effeminate gay male"" interests that I have. But I've got a whole lot more going on, that just blows those stereotypes right out of the water. I can shoot a .22. And I'm really accurate. Splitting wood? Girl, you know I got that.  Hiking? Puh-leeze! I walked 2184 miles on the Appalachian Trail last year. I know all about shitting in the woods for months and months.

Don't hate what you are. Love yourself.  ""Cause if you can't love yourself then how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an 'Amen!'""","1372636864"

Hi, /r/personalfinance here. People who lost ""everything"" in the crash and haven't long since recovered made overly risky bets. Don't invest in company stock or individual stocks, especially in your 401(k) or IRA.

Generally, you want to buy and hold low-cost broad-market index funds for your asset allocation (which you determine based on your age and risk tolerance). This type of portfolio is hands free, allows you to ignore whatever the idiots on Wall Street think the market is going to do this week, and produces the highest expected long-term returns.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A couple of teachers stand out for me.

First was Mr. C. He was my shop teacher in high school, and he was a really cool guy. He actually was partly responsible for my nickname (or, specifically, getting my nickname to stick). I was called Sci-Fi all through high school. I actually quite liked it, to be honest. But how I actually got the name is a story for another thread.

Like I said, Mr. C was a cool guy, he'd joke around with everyone, but I could tell as I was ending my time in high school that he was getting tired. Not, like, angry and fed up, but physically tired. In my last year there, he had so many operations done, mainly on his vocal chords because he spoke so loudly, and you could tell it was taking a toll on him. One day, a student mouthed off to him and he snapped, slapping the kid across the face. The kid got angry and stormed out, Mr. C followed. A few minutes later, Mr. C came back in, visibly upset and shaken, and apologized for his behavior. Most of the other students thought the kid deserved the slap, though.

The other teacher was one of my sister's teachers, we'll call him Mr. K. I think he might have taught English. I can't remember all of the things my sister told me about this guy, but he was apparently quite sexist. One of the things he would do is make comments about female students' breasts, among other things, and at one point implied that all the guys in the school only went to the bathroom to masturbate to images of the girl's dance class (my school an arts school and the dance studio was on the way to the bathroom, thus if someone wanted to they could steal a quick peek in the window as the girls were practicing).","1372636878"

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","Kinda, generally speaking a Supreme Court decision is ""officially final"" 25 days after the opinion is released (so, in theory, a justice could change their mind within that period of time and change the decision. I don't know of any case it's ever happened, but it is technically possible.) The 9th circuit had put a stay on gay marriage in California ""until the Supreme Court reached a decision"" and lifted the ban once the opinion was released (instead of waiting the 25 days as many courts do.) The opponents of equal marriage, wanting to stop gay marriage as long as possible filed a request for an ""emergency stay"" claiming that by not waiting 25 days, the 9th circuit acted illegally. (Presumably, they wanted 25 days to figure out some way to make gay marriage illegal again.)

Ironically, these emergency stay requests don't go to the full court, they go before a justice based on the circuit they're coming from. As it turns out, Kennedy (who was in the majority overturning DOMA) is the justice who hears the requests for the 9th circuit. 

I don't think the equal marriage opponents thought they would win this (though I have seen some delusional people amongst them) I think it was a ""we have nothing to lose by filing this and we have about a 1% of getting to take away gay people's rights again.""","1372636880"

"Turkey","t5_2qlnu","The need to divide Turkish people in any possible way seems very interesting but also kind of desperate. 

The strongest tool that could be used to divide people in a country like Turkey is probably religion.The problem is since all the sides are Muslim people, one has to come up with ways of making the other side 'less Muslim' and work from there. Looks like the plan is:

* Make ignorant Muslim people believe the other side hates them, and doesn't really care about them because the other side is not really Muslim, they are infidels, intellectuals, artists, pokemon whatever...

* Make educated Muslim people believe the other side is just a bunch of religious extremists, ready to blow themselves up, behead kittens etc.

* Slowly increase the contrast. 

* Profit.

Other than religion of course there is good old race. But that's not really working these days. The more people realize what's going on in the bottom right corner the more the whole PKK/Kurdistan thing looks like a big masquerade. Seems like BDP would shit themselves if Turkey spent half of the country's budget to bring the area to the 21st century. 
It's not allowed to have people in the west support Kurdish people. This kind of breaks the design. Just today one of the BDP guys talked shit about protesters(who were btw showing support for people in Lice) and acted like a proper ass hair.

I got carried away sorry. I'm not really qualified to make an analysis of the situation. It's going to shit though.","1372636891"

All the infrastructure that we have now will be available then so it would only take a directly democratic town meeting to decide what you need then a quick phone call to the other communes to get resources you can't ascertain any other way.

You might say that this sounds like a barter system, but you'd be wrong in that you would contact the communes that have an abundance of what you need and it would be given to you freely and whatever abundance of stuff your commune has will be given freely to others who need it and so on down the line until the resources are distributed as needed as determined by the people in the communes. 

Each commune would be ran directly democratically, meaning delegation rather than representation by an electorate. And the assigned delegates would be the ones contacting other communes when other stuff is needed or to decide any large scale action.

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","Here some tips for you even if I don't play ranked a lot , I got some strat with excellent win-rate:

-If you got a friend, you can duo queue with him and try a kill lane.
I know it's not very liked by the community but if you go Jarvan IV+ Annie bot, you will have fb at level 2. This combo has 100% win rate with me and my brother. Just ask for your mid or your top to take an ADC if your time really wants one.

-Try to become good with champs that can carry.
Singed top, Nautilus jungle,J4 jungle,Udyr jungle ( I like to jungle to carry ) you have to choose an high mobility+tanky champ. The fact is , if your team is bad, you will have to force snowballing, take risk to be far ahead your lane/jungle.

Here some junglers/top tips:

-One thing important if you jungle is you have to think carefully: 
if your botlane if feeding hard will you go bot to help or is it better to feed your top so he will destroy their adc? It's quite rare that all your lanes are winning so, sometime you will have to "" sacrifice "" a lane to win the game. ( Also , try to talk to them, don't let them ragequit or else, tell them your choice, and explain,peacefully so they will understand ( I hope )).

-Try to be in the ennemy mind.
I main jungle and there are some obvious timing that you have to know,It really help your team and yourself , and it can allow you to counterplay hard. I think you can know them pretty fast but , for example, for a ""blue path"" jungler, he will be lvl 3 and ready to gank at 3 min, so tell your lane if they push or something else.

-Try to see the skilled player in your team.
You can't have 4 bad players around you ( unless... well , unlucky matches ) so if you can, ""bet "" on him. Feed him and protect him ( jungle ) or support him ( top/ support ). As always you will have to be carefull and to choose wiselly. I won some 4v5 matches by feeding a skilled veigar mid, Jayce top ,or some agressives Vaynes with good reaction.

Well , I got some others tips but i got to go, hope It help you and sorry for my english , not my native language.","1372636895"

The fact is that any game realistically simulating modern infantry combat would have make it so that a single shot in the arm or leg or really anywhere is incapacitating. This doesn't really make for a fun playable game. Either you have to settle for an unrealistic game where bullets don't hurt enough to stop you or an unrealistic game where no one is competent enough to shoot you or a game like what is found in today's CoD or Battlefield or the like where there's a balance between these two extremes.

I know it's not a directly comparable situation (not least because a snowball fight in Iraq isn't terribly likely); my point is that one cannot say that *all* the soldiers in the photo can be said to have the same political motives - or that they necessarily support the political aims of their commander in chief.

&gt;""Bring in the accused!""

&gt;There was a scuffling of mailed feet and a rattling of chains. A woman, huge, with broad shoulders and muscled arms, was pushed into the hall. ""I can walk!"" she yelled, spitting at her captors, two knights cloaked in gold, their helms bearing a single, long spike. Daenerys eyed her wearily. This was the fifteenth criminal who had faced her today, and she was growing bored with handing down sentences.

&gt;The straw-haired woman tramped to the center of the room, bound hand and foot. Even chained as she was, the gold cloaks seemed afraid to go near her. ""Approach the throne,"" Dany said. She shifted in said throne, trying to find a position that would ease the iron digging into her back and rear.

&gt;The gold cloaks shoved her forward roughly, prodding at her with the butt end of their spears until she fell to her knees at the steps of the Iron Throne. As the woman got to her feet, Dany could see she was ill-featured, with flat cheeks, a bulging nose, and a spray of freckles across her face. But her eyes, the woman glared at her with blue eyes, gleaming with malice and hatred. 

&gt;""Remind me again of this woman,"" Daenerys said to the impish advisor seated at her side.

&gt;""Brienne of Tarth,"" Tyrion said. He, too, sized up the rebel, watching as she tested her chains. ""Born the eldest daughter of Selwyn Tarth, Lord of the Sapphire Isle. Witnesses have said that she leads the Brotherhood Without Banners, who you may recall are causing us significant trouble in the riverlands. My brother spoke quite highly of her, of both her skill with the blade and of her honor. That is why he gave her the blade Oathkeeper, forged of Valyrian steel, with the charge to search out and return the daughters of Catelyn Stark.""

&gt;""And then she killed him,"" Daenerys said, remembering what Tyrion had told her.

&gt;""Yes,"" said Tyrion sadly. ""And then she killed him.""

&gt;Daenerys stood, her white gown flowing to the stone floor. ""Brienne of Tarth,"" she said, loudly enough that all the gathered lords and ladies could hear her, ""you stand accused of inciting rebellion against the Throne, of murder, of treason, of brigandry, of a host of other crimes too numerous to list. Your victims, both high and low, leave behind families, mothers, wives, children, who will never see their loved ones again. How do you respond? Do you deny that you are the bandit Lady Stoneheart?""

&gt;Never breaking eye contact with her accuser, Brienne stood straight-backed and said, ""Lady Stoneheart. Some choose to call me by that name, and I do not deny it. But I committed no crimes. The Brotherhood Without Banners dispenses justice, something I haven't seen from the Iron Throne since Ned Stark sat it as Hand of the King.""

&gt;Rage bubbled up inside Dany. ""You say 'justice' in the same breath as the name of that usurper? How dare you? Ser Jorah,"" she said, sitting back down, ""I want her executed.""

&gt;Jorah nodded, and made a signal to the gold cloaks. Four made to seize Brienne, but she forced them back and yelled, ""You call *this* justice, then?""

&gt;Dany snorted. ""More justice than you gave to Walder Frey.""

&gt;The guards seized Brienne by the back of her burlap shift and hauled her backwards, but Brienne fought them. ""I demand a trial by combat!"" 

&gt;""Stop,"" Daenerys said, gesturing to the gold cloaks. They released Brienne, and the woman walked forward.

&gt;""I demand a trial by combat, as is my right, in the eyes of the old gods and the new.""

&gt;Daenerys watched Brienne closely. ""You are the first of the criminals I've tried to request trial by combat. When my father was king,"" Daenerys said, ""he chose fire as the champion of House Targaryen."" That unnerved Lady Stoneheart, Daenerys took pleasure to see. Uncertainty crossed her face like a shadow. ""But I am not so unkind. Very well!"" she shouted. ""A trial by combat it will be, and all Westeros will see that Queen Daenerys Stormborn is just! Guards, remove her binds, and bring her a sword.""

&gt;The gold cloaks did as they were bid. Brienne rubbed her wrists where the chains had chafed them raw, as one of the guards handed a longsword. ""Your Grace,"" he said, ""should this one bring her a shield as well?""

&gt;""No. Let 'justice' be her shield. If it is on her side, she will have no need for oak and iron. As for my champion..."" 

&gt;A score of voices clamored for her attention, and the rest of the great hall was filled with murmurs. Various knights from houses that had joined her cause when she landed on the shores of Westeros were calling out their own names. Strong Belwas thumped his chest and said, ""A woman cuts as easily as a man. Let Strong Belwas fight for you."" All three of her bloodriders were raising their weapons, yelling, ""Khaleesi! Khaleesi!"" Not for the first time, Dany wished for the strong sword of Ser Barristan, downed by a dozen wounds taken in the Sack on King's Landing.

&gt;""Khaleesi,"" came Ser Jorah's voice from her side. ""You don't have to do this. We have sufficient witnesses. There is no need to leave this to chance.""

&gt;""She won't have a chance,"" Dany said. ""Grey Worm.""

&gt;The room quieted, and a soldier came out of the crowd. ""Your Grace."" He bore a short spear in one hand, and a three-spiked helmet under the other. ""Your Grey Worm stands ready.""

&gt;""Dispense my justice.""

&gt;A cheer went up through the room. The other Unsullied cleared out a large circle in the middle of the hall. People were packed densely, crowded around the edges. Some children were even perched on the dragon skulls Daenerys had returned to the Great Hall. All were eager to witness the latest instance of Targaryen justice. Daenerys smiled. Grey Worm would bring her the head of this Brienne of Tarth, breaking the back of the Brotherhood and solidifying her hold on the Riverlands. 

&gt;Grey Worm donned his helm and stepped into the makeshift arena. Brienne moved opposite him, and the two began to circle each other. The woman was tall, Daenerys noted, taller than Grey Worm by at least a head. But that was fine. Grey Worm had taken down opponents taller than her before. 

&gt;Brienne was the first to make a move, thrusting forward with her longsword. Wielding a spear, Grey Worm had the superior reach, and he batted away her attack. Lightning fast, the Unsullied cut upward, aiming for her face, but Brienne jerked backwards just in time. 

&gt;""A spear always beats a sword in an open space like this,"" Tyrion said. He took a thirsty swig from a goblet of wine. ""If Brienne hopes to win, she'll have to get inside his reach.""

&gt;""Which she will never do,"" Dany answered. ""Grey Worm is the best of my Unsullied.""

&gt;""I don't know,"" Tyrion said. ""I'm glad I made no wager on this match.""

&gt;With a series of quick stabs, Grey Worm pressed Brienne hard. Having no shield, Brienne was forced to either try to block with her sword or give ground. Within a moment, Grey Worm had forced her back against the crowd. But here, the human wall proved a hinderance to Grey Worm, preventing him from using his full reach against Brienne for fear of striking an innocent. He switched instead to sweeping horizontal cuts, aiming for Brienne's legs and stomach.

&gt;Brienne drew her sword diagonally in front of her, knocking the spear wide to her right. Before Grey Worm could recover, Brienne pressed her advantage, moving forward aggressively. But Grey Worm spun on his heel, twirling the spear and catching her on the side of the head with the shaft. Brienne shrieked in pain, clutching her left temple. Red ran down under her hand, and she backed away. Wiping the blooded hand on her clothes, Brienne resumed a defensive posture, her sword between her and Grey Worm.

&gt;The jeers from the crowd intensified at the sight of a wound. Everyone was focused intently on the match. Tyrion was discussing Grey Worm's prowess with Jorah, and Strong Belwas was crunching down handfuls of something from a metal bowl, his eyes locked on the two combatants. Jhogo was handing Rakharo a few coins, no doubt the result of a lost bet on who would draw first blood. Men were cheering, women were chanting, all around her was a noisy cacophony, and above it all the iron scent of blood. Like the smell of the fighting pits in Meereen. A wave of nausea washed over her. 

&gt;""What is this?"" Daenerys said, more to herself than either of her advisors. 

&gt;""Justice,"" Tyrion answered, his eyes never leaving the fighters, ""for my brother.""

&gt;Down the steps, Grey Worm had done further damage, a cut to the leg. As the stain spread over the brown cloth, Brienne seemed to grow more calculating. Her face gave no indication of the wounds she bore, and she rained a series of overhand blows down at Grey Worm, forcing him to raise his spear to deflect them. Wooden splinters flew with each hit, and despite the reach advantage, Grey Worm was being backed into a corner.

&gt;No fear showed in Grey Worm as the size of his opponent threatened to overwhelm him. With a shove, he pushed away Brienne's sword and rolled to the side. Down low, he stabbed upwards at her belly, catching her in the trunk just above the hip. Brienne's clothes ripped like paper and blood spilled out onto the shaft of the spear. 

&gt;With only a grunt to mark her pain, Brienne knocked the spear away just as before. And just as before, Grey Worm spun to prevent her from moving inside the reach of his weapon. But Brienne was expecting it, and caught the bladeless end of the spear with her hand. Wrenching it, she threw Grey Worm off balance. Brienne pulled, and the blood-slickened shaft slipped through Grey Worm's fingers to the blade. With a roar, Brienne brought her sword down on the shaft. The wood, already weakened by repeated hits, splintered.

My point is sure, maybe in 500 years well have warp drive, transporters, or Ion engines that produce .5G acceleration for days on a small fuel tank.  The fact is none of these exist today and there is no guarantee that they ever will.  Physics can be a harsh mistress.

What you're saying is, why take those expensive airliners when we might have transporters some day.  Lets all just stay home until we have transporters, it is a waste of money to take one of those gas guzzling 747s.  

Right now, if you want to go to a distant country then a kerosene burning aircraft with a turbofan engine is the way to do it.  Maybe someday we will have transporters and maybe we wont.

I'm also going to call you out on chemical rockets being inefficient.  Inefficient compared to what?  No other technology exists that can do what chemical rockets can so they are be definition the most efficient thing we have.

There is actually quite a lot of attention in regards to the ideal amount of taxes for cigerettes, as marijuana legalization is looking like an increasing possibility, and cigerettes provide a good guidelilne to the ideal taxation of marijuana.  The government wants to get the most tax revenue possible of course, but they also don't want to have taxation so high that everybody buys their pot from the black market.  Cigarette sales are a pretty good indication of how much taxation people will tolerate before seeking out illegal goods.

*Unrealistic*;*Headshots are headshots*;*Realistic*

The realism levels and difficulties don't actually match up, in most games, the realism stays around Medium, while the difficulty goes up, which means - yeah, headshots will kill them, but you better have a lot of ammo if you can't hit that. 

This. Is. A. Problem. Gamers crave that experience of a difficult game, but we want one that isn't incredibly unrealistic. I know that I don't want to put 3 clips into some NPC simply because I'm playing on the higher difficulty.

These kinds of threads always end up with people listing off strong female characters in games, but I think it's a product of gaming maturing.  Games are taken more seriously today than in the past, and are not thought of as just a child's toy anymore, so mature characters of either gender are a lot more common.  Not only are there more strong women like Faith (Mirror's Edge), but more flawed, realistic men like Ethan (Heavy Rain).

Not only does the master of such a scheme have a personal incentive not to do that, all those under him do, too.  It is a very hard scheme to keep going without immediate schisms.

Furthermore, charging higher prices will cause consumers to consume less and seek out substitutes, causing further losses for the monopolist.

&gt;Besides, any investor would consider fighting such a monopoly a very large investment risk with mediocre returns for the risk.

Not at all.  It's actually very cheap and very profitable to compete against an unwieldy monopoly as a firm closer to your industry's economy of scale with roughly similar products (other metals and alloys of comparable function, but much lower price), because such a firm's costs are significantly smaller.","1372636918"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Yes, you're right.  Here is a summary from about.com:

&gt;Radical feminism is a philosophy emphasizing the patriarchal roots of inequality between men and women, or, more specifically, social dominance of women by men. Radical feminism views patriarchy as dividing rights, privileges and power primarily by gender, and as a result oppressing women and privileging men.
Radical feminists tend to be more militant in their approach (radical as ""getting to the root""). Radical feminism opposes existing political and social organization in general because it is inherently tied to patriarchy. Thus, radical feminists tend to be skeptical of political action within the current system, and instead support cultural change that undermines patriarchy and associated hierarchical structures.
Radical feminism opposes patriarchy, not men. To equate radical feminism to man-hating is to assume that patriarchy and men are inseparable, philosophically and politically. 

The last point is extremely important to grasp.  Radical feminists do believe that in general there is a system whereby men in society take on the role of oppressor - that that is what it means to be a man - you must be dominant.  Saying things that way can seem hateful to some people.  But it is an essential part of radical feminism that men do not have to take on that role.  That is the heart of radical feminism.  Men can choose not to take on that role and can choose not to propagate it.  There's nothing hateful about that.","1372636922"

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","There are many reasons why:

1) ADC's scale best with gold, hence the reason why they're put together with a second champion in the lane and not the top laner of mid laner because they scale best with XP. Buying Tabis would effectively only benefit the ADC in lane as an ADC isn't supposed to get caught in teamfights. Alltogether tabis would be wasted money because an ADC is supposed to deal high DPS and tabis don't fit into that build. This would pretty much destroy the reason for putting an ADC together with a support in lane because the ADC would be throwing away the gold he scales with.

2) Tabis only work against AA's, not all ADCs rely on their AA's. Graves and Ezreal(and MF-kind of) rely more on the burst damage from their spells. Not to mention the magic damage, poke and harras from the enemy support(Lulu,Sona).

3)Because they scale of gold the ADC should build according to his purpose in the team, and not waste any of his money on items that don't benefit their spellkit/purpose in the team. They are supposed to be high damage dealers with high attack speed(blue ezreal is an exception).


Of course this is purely solo queue meta and this doesn't apply to pro level tournament play where ADCs sometimes buy tabis.","1372636924"

As I understand it, once there is some evidence of self-defense, that burden is on the prosecution to prove Zimmerman did not act in self defense.

So two questions (with five question marks). First, when is the determination made about the prosecution's burden? Is there a pre-trial hearing where evidence of self-defense is introduced?

Second, has the prosecution offered any evidence on this? And if it fails to, could (should?) the case be dismissed when the prosecution closes?","1372636934"

&gt;Opiates can be fucking lonely, boy. $250k and counting. And there isn't one single person in the world I can call right now who would treat me like a friend. It's not like trees; opiates take things that you thought were intrinsic human rights (social interaction, pride, health ... the ability to make it to one fucking doctor's appointment in two months) and strip you down to less than nothing. Everyone is suspect, everyone will hurt you, no one can be trusted. And the day you forget that is the day you die or go to jail.
&gt;
&gt;I woke up about an hour ago and I'm trying to feel good enough to go buy again. If I can find enough early, I might migrate over to my apartment's pool and try to make normal small talk with people. I might get a conversation in before they realize I'm actually a crazy drug addict and should be avoided. I don't usually, though. It's just nice to have one minute of normalcy.

&gt;My husband will wake up sometime later but life has us so twisted and we're both in such crisis that it's difficult. He's my love, my life, my everything ... but we're both weights.

In trying to make the most of the summer break, I tried to be more of an extrovert (and needing to lose weight), I joined my co-workers who would meet up and hike.  Did great on the first 4 hikes, loved every minute of it, and actually started to gain a little confidence while losing a little weight.  Hike #5 did me in.  Co-workers made the hike all the way up, with me lagging waaaaay behind.  Finally made it up to the top, so happy!  Started down after about a 20 min rest.  Once again, I'm going slower than everyone else.  I try to speed it up a little, ankle rolled on me, and I went down.  These are railroad ties going up the side of a mountain, so on my way down, I hit the left side of my body on the steel rail (bruise to left boob, left leg is swollen).  When I right myself, I notice my pinkie on my right hand is hanging away from my hand (like it up and decided to leave the group).  Needless to say, the rest of the hike down was terrible, but one of my friends helped me back down (thank god).  
Wound up in the er, head cat-scan, x-rayed left leg, and right hand.  The ER nurse started an IV but I don't think it was done correctly because the area swells up and there is a HUGE bruise where the IV was.  Waited and waited (my hand was throbbing), finally released after 5 hours (they taped my pinkie to the ring finger - that was all).  They told me to follow up with orthopedics dept. in 7-9 days. In the morning, called orthopedics, luckily they were able to see me at 2pm.  Went in and was told I was smart not to have waited the 7-9 days, because my pinkie is dislocated, and broken in several places (the hand surgeon filed a complaint with the er doctor).
Now I have this awful, clunky cast, and have taken to just sitting in front of the computer all day.  I think my depression has worsened.  I just can't seem to get going...  Oh, and I'm also now broke, currently waiting for the next payday.
I know that my story pales in comparison to everyone else's, but I guess I'm just a big baby. :(

Main hotspots are Stormwind, Silvermoon, and often the Valley of Honor tavern in Org. Also I was in the Night Elf start zone on MG recently, and the joint was jumpin'.

Trade and guild recruitment channels will have rp guild spam, or you could just wander around. Pick up an rp add on like MyRolePlay so you can read others' bios and write your own.

Grey Worm stumbled to his feet, turning to face his assailant, and Brienne brought her sword down.

The two held that position for a moment, before Brienne tugged the sword from his brain and the Unsullied fell to the stones, his lifeblood leaking out. There was a collective gasp. Towards the back, a woman began to cry. Another vomited. Low murmurs broke out across the hall. 

&gt;""Shall I kill her myself, my Queen?"" Aggo was at her side. He had drawn his bow and notched an arrow.

&gt;""But, Your Grace,"" Tyrion said.

"infp","t5_2qn2o","Hi and welcome. As another INFP college student, I don't have all the answers but I can definitely say you're not alone. I think finding our place in the world is such a big deal to us because we need to do something that matches up with our core values. We need a job that's about more than the money to be happy, and that can be really challenging to find. I definitely think that studying music, if that's what you love, is a far better choice for you than trying to get into a more job secure/higher paying field. After all, you'll be the one who has to go to whatever job you choose every day, not your parents or friends or anyone else.

I have an excellent quote about guilt that some anonymous stranger said on the internet once, and I think every INFP should take it to heart: ""I'm inclined to think that guilt is an avoidance of responsibility. If I experience guilt for my actions, then I can keep the belief that I really couldn't do better and the guilt is my payment for the action. Responsibility is simple -- if you think you can do better, then do better."" 

Guilt is kind of the most useless form of sadness--sadness over something YOU can control, namely, your own actions. If you think you can do better, do better. If you can't do better, you have nothing to be guilty about. Simple.  

I'm not sure if all INFPs are like this or not, but I know in my own case I am the champion of over-complicating things. Thinking about a problem is good, but getting into a rut of worrying and stressing without actually taking any action is not very productive. If you catch yourself fretting uselessly over something, try to remind yourself that it's not constructive and do anything you enjoy(maybe play your instrument of choice if you're a music guy?) to give your mind a little break. 

I don't think any of the issues you've listed here are simply ""a product of your personality type."" It plays a role, sure, but it's not like because you are an INFP you will always have X problem and there is nothing you can do about it. Using your strengths and weaknesses to your advantage sounds like a great idea.","1372636951"

I totally agree about skill levels, because the only standard we could use is the JLPT and as mentioned the levels don't mean all that much, not to mention that there are many people who don't do them for various reasons and checking those who have is time intensive.

Realistically, for a forum like this, highlighting the users who frequently give good information (in the opinion of mods) is far more useful than knowing levels. Make the bar high and make it a way to point out users who are exceptional contributors rather than who just come here a lot.

"3DS","t5_2ruhy","I think Paper Mario was such a let down. Having played through the original Paper Mario, Thousand Year Door and Super Paper Mario (tied for least favorite with Sticker Star..) in eager anticipation, the feeling I had upon finishing it was...blech. 

Functionally, it was great. The combat/timing was super tight and movement felt responsive. The sticker mechanic was even kind of novel for a little while, being able to interact with the environment or gain an advantage in battle with particular stickers. The soundtrack was one of my favorites of the year. The charming narrative ever present in previous games, even SPM, was sorely absent. The lack of a cohesive over world to traverse and explore was a detriment to the experience, in my opinion. The gutting of the rpg systems removed most of the incentive to engage in random battles, besides accruing coins to buy stickers to win battles... Ugh.

I had heard that it was Miyamoto who convinced the super talented team at Intelligent Systems it was not the story people cared about, but the gameplay mechanics. He made this decision based off information gathered by a Club Nintendo survey regarding Super Paper Mario. Not even one percent said the story was interesting, but apparently many people found the 2D/3D switching to be fun..

It feels similar to Capcom canceling Megaman Legends 3, attributing it to lack of fan interest..

"self","t5_2qh96","I don't know how much it costs to go to college in the UK, but in the US, a good out-of-state University will cost $40,000-50,000 *per year*. In-state schools might be 30,000, and a lot of really high-end schools will be $60,000. So if you didn't have any scholarships or grants, you could owe $200,000± (~£131,500) *before* interest to Uncle Sam and private institutions. And that's just for your basic undergrad degree.

My main issue is the iPhone compatibility. It says iPhone compatible, but that's only for the 4 and 4S. The issue is there isn't a Lightning cable for it. I tried plugging the OEM Apple Lightning cable into the USB input on the radio, but that doesn't really work. When I emailed JVC about it, they basically told me to get a different unit.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Agreed. Don't borrow on more money then you need. 

Best way to build credit from a ""ghost"" up is a *secured credit card*. Go to your bank with $500 cash in hand. You turn over the cash, they give you a credit card with that maximum balance. The trick here is to USE IT. But only use it on things you need. What I did is used my secured card only for gas. It was my *gas card*, if you will. That was something I *had* to budget for so I would always have the finances to pay it off every month. 

The second best thing you could do is buy a car. A thousand cash down, on an inexpensive car is the second fastest way to skyrocket your credit score. 12 months of perfect pay (with no derogatory on your credit report) and you can expect all three bureaus to be 700+.

"taoism","t5_2qhmd","I don't like to view non-attachment as if we've risen above it all. That just makes for reinforcing a dualism (us and the rest of the world) that doesn't truly exist. I saw this quote on r/Buddhism a while ago and think it hits the nail on the head. It's a quote from Zen master John Daido Loori:

""According to the Buddhist point of view, nonattachment is exactly the opposite of separation. You need two things in order to have attachment: the thing you’re attaching to, and the person who’s attaching. In nonattachment, on the other hand, there’s unity. There’s unity because there’s nothing to attach to. If you have unified with the whole universe, there’s nothing outside of you, so the notion of attachment becomes absurd. Who will attach to what?""
*****
The confusion often arises when people think that this is the same kind of attachment as when we love someone. But it isn't. This kind of attachment is when we cling to an *idea* of what something is like, and ignore what its true nature is. When we act as if something is permanent, when we act as if its behavior is *certain*. These are just ideas we have, they don't reflect reality. When we're at one with reality, such ideas cannot exist because all is in flux. There is nothing of that nature to cling on to. Rather we indulge in the ever-changing flux that is the Tao, bringing beauty and life as its shape and form changes in each manifestation.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Your words:

&gt; This was discussed on the AKO (Army Knowledge Online) forums. The prevailing opinion that I saw from active Infantry members was that to say that Infantry was just ""another job"" was a huge fallacy. They don't see it as a job. It's a way of life. It's the ""call of the warrior"". That's the issue with civilians. They are so used to 9-5 jobs that they see everything in that light. From people in the military: ""civilians wouldn't know what real teamwork was if it slapped them in the face."" I only use the word ""job"" in order to use a term which is more agreeable with the general population. It's really a way of life.

I question:

&gt;Is this to say women in the Infantry would view it as something different from the way the men do?

The meaning:  I was asking if you thought women in the infantry would treat it as just a job, or as a way of life.  If it's a way of life, I think it stands to reason they would be just as dedicated to this mission, this order and would behave in a way comparable to men in the situation.

It's presumptuous to assume the people supporting integration of women into these positions are doing so based on trite and superficial notions.  I don't know the background you have in being critical of it, and you don't know my background in supporting it.  To reduce the opposing viewpoints to a dichotomy of principled valiant defenders to shallow naive fools misses the point of even engaging in the discussion, to which we are all entitled as members of a society in which a civil representative government is the establisher and enforcer of the rule of law.  My point in bringing up those other occupations/jobs/etc is that these are civilians that are not normally working a 9-5 job, and even if they were, it's unproductive to denigrate the opinions of other people who have a valid interest in the policy.

With regards to injuries, the [leading cause of evacuations from war zones is musculoskeletal injuries](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/leading_cause_of_medical_evacuation_out_of_war_zones_its_not_combat_injury).  This particular kind of injury, in the field of combat, affects men as well as women.  It in all likelihood affects women more, yes, but is clearly a problem overall and begs the question if the amount of weight our soldiers are carrying is turning their bodies into consumable commodities in another fashion other than bleeding for our foreign policy goals.

As for your linked article, here is the stated purpose of this study, as quoted from the paper itself:
&gt;This study was conducted to determine the nature and the frequency of lower extremity
disorders incurred by men and women undergoing Army basic training and to analyze the
differential effects of two types of combat boots on lower extremity disorders. The feet and
lower legs of 2,074 men and 767 women were examined by medical personnel prior to the -
initiation of training and on three other occasions over the eight weeks of training. The data
from these examinations were augmented by the diagnoses and case dispositions associated with sick call visits for lower extremity problems. It was found that the rates of occurrence
of blisters and lace lesions were higher among the test participants who wore hot weather
boots than among those who wore black leather boots. Of 27 types of lower extremity disorders diagnosed among the participants, two were incurred only by men and two only by women. The remaining disorders were identified in both sexes and statistical analyses revealed that 12 of these disorders were experienced by a significantly higher proportion of women than men.  None of the disorders diagnosed in both sexes were incurred by a significantly higher proportion of men than women. The number of sick call visits and duty restrictions for lower extremity problems were also analyzed as a function of gender and boot type.

I pasted the whole thing in there because I think it both supports and undermines your reason for linking the study.  The study was conducted not only to examine differences in men and women injury rates in the lower extremities(though it did analyze these things with the data collected), but to compare the effects of two different kinds of footwear(which the study also notes both of which were designed with male feet as the primary, if not only, consideration).  There's likely some more recent studies from basic training we can refer to as well, as this was done apparently in 1983(this is not to say there is any issue with the validity of the findings but more that there might be a more recent one that specifically controls all other factors aside from sex).  It's also worth noting the study found two kinds of disorders unique to men, Osgood-Schlatter and osteochondritis dessicans, which in the general population does affect men more frequently but this is assumed to be because men participate in more strenuous sports and activities, something which would be somewhat mitigated by basic training regiment(though not eliminated, as you rightfully pointed out women have less demanding benchmarks to meet).  That said, the report specifically states this:

&gt;No lower extremity disorders diagnosed in members of both sexes were incurred by a significantly higher proportion of men than women.

While it makes no final claim as to the root cause of this, it does offer three possible factors:

&gt;Among these are anatomical structure, physical fitness level, and fit of the footwear.

There are multiple other portions in the study which indicate presumptions of female fragility may be overstated or simply that they report disorders more readily than males.

&gt;Examination of physician visits for diagnosed conditions revealed that women seek health care proportionately more often than do men with the same conditions.

I don't consider the readiness to seek treatment for a given problem to be a detriment.  This is not to say the numbers would be equal, but if men are 'toughing it out' because they don't want to be accused of malingering or seen as weak, that not only masks data but is a self-inflicted disservice to our personnel.

It also notes multiple times in the text that the far and away most common disorder was blisters, and states they happen heavily very early on in both men and women(20%/23% and 27%/35% for leather and hot weather respectively) and attributes these kinds of injuries to not being fully prepared for the military lifestyle, or more to the point people's feet just weren't used to marching around constantly wearing boots.  Those of us who've gone through basic training of some kind can relate to this finding in varying degrees.  Once people's feet start building up callouses, their skin toughens up to the demands and rigors of military activity, the incidence drops for both sexes(but certainly remains higher for women).

I note these various points not to say the sexes are equal.  Certainly, they're not.  I point it out to illustrate that neither sex is the paragon of physicality that an ideal candidate would represent.  By accepting human being into our military we are necessarily accepting people who will have varying degrees of injuries at varying rates of incidence.  This report and others like it exist as an acknowledgement of that fact and are used to reduce these numbers as much as possible for both sexes.  The higher incidences of women ending up with these injuries does not make for a justification to outright ban them from this area of service.  If anything, perhaps raising the standards to be more comparable with men might discourage women who are unprepared for the demands of this lifestyle and would certainly mitigate contempt from men who feel women are treated with kid gloves.  It would likely reduce the number of women entering the service or raise the attrition rate in basic training, but these would be potential solutions rather than attempting to maintain a carte blanche prohibition in a particular portion of our military services.

He had a lot of money into his grow, but I'll give you that he was and still is an ignorant mother fucker.  Daddy's money all the way.

Now for a point about NATURAL selection vs. ARTIFICIAL selection.  Cannabis plants grown outdoors are subject to survival of the FITTEST.  Fittest in this respect means most adept at flourishing in a  given environment.  Now indoor growing has been going on about 40 years.  During that time we've been selecting for the FITTEST specimens.  What does fit mean indoors?  Potency, yield, mold resistance, etc. 

Look at what we did with dogs in just a few thousand years.  They have a much longer life cycle than a cannabis plant and a genome at least as complex if not more so.  Not to be condescending but you're comparing apples to Buicks and if you want to learn anything you gotta stop with this hippy-dippy bullshit about the sun.  If you think all the plants we're growing today are a product of NATURAL selection than please tell me where I can find the nearest pack of wild teacup poodles or pomeranians.

You'd think the race planners could discern likely runoff areas and keep them clear.  For instance if a car is going around a left bend then, if it wipes out, it will do so to its right.  So, keep that area clear of spectators and put them on the inside of the turn.

"rapecounseling","t5_2rfx0","I've felt the same way. The biggest part of counseling is reconciling those feelings of ""I feel this but it isn't me feeling this."" Until you go to counseling you generally push down the event and try to avoid it as much as possible but that doesn't help you heal; it's just like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound. Sadly, the biggest part of healing from rape involves a lot of pain. It's a wound that needs to be cauterized not one that can just heal by leaving it alone.

I'm going to try a quick summary of why talk therapy is used so often in traumatic events. When something traumatic happens your body automatically ties certain things to the event. It's why you have triggers where certain seasons, smells, sounds, words will upset you or bring you back into the mindset of DANGER! IMMEDIATE AND PRESENT DANGER! even when you are perfectly safe. Talk therapy forces you to relive the event in a safe place so your body can realize that there is a difference between what happened and the triggers; that the triggers don't actually mean that you are in immediate and present danger. 

It's a roller coaster and it's difficult and frustrating but it's so worth coming out on the other end. Everything you have said, I've experienced but I pushed through it because the longer you put off counseling, the more likely it is that you will have/continue to have PTSD symptoms. 

From a book I recently bought ([Resurrection After Rape](http://www.resurrectionafterrape.org/))(there is a free pdf version available on the site.): ""Research finds that 94% of rape victims meet criteria for PTSD within the first week after a rape. Three months later, that rate drops to 50% but this is where the improvements stall. ...with no further recovery occurring without therapy.""  

And then from the same book about what a therapist's job is: ""A therapist's job is to understand the research into why the brain develops certain patterns of thought and emotion after trauma, and which techniques can be used to diminish these symptoms. One thing a good therapist will do is provide research-based, well developed homework assignments that will challenge your thoughts and beliefs, so that your instinctive responses are altered away from trauma-based responses, toward a more conscious, controlled response. This 'thought-challenging' cannot happen internally and independently; it takes an external other person who can identify your mind's patterns and apply research-based methods of nudging those patterns into gentle change.""

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Well when the definition is equality then I am right regardless of up or down votes. Congrats on being up voted for name calling, but im pretty sure, overall, that Ive been voted more (but like it matters?) Hey look, your being down voted now. Lol, I wonder what that means. 

No, you didn't give me evidence. You gave me opinion piece on obviously right wing websites. Like you, the authors had no idea what they were talking about. You're still trying to argue the definition of feminism. 

No, you didn't show me feminism that contradicts feminism. You also haven't provided me actual examples. You claim that you do, but you haven't. Sorry, right wing talking points aren't proof. They only show that there is an agenda to discredit women's equality. 

No, just two sites that are both extremely biased. They don't even cover/talk about discrimination of women throughout history. Pretty sure your ""source"" shouldn't even be writing especially since feminism has allowed her to get where she is today. I'm also assuming she mad that she can own land and vote in elections. Damn equality, it gave her things today that she takes for granted. 

Sorry, but it's not propaganda and it's the real definition. Your retarded definition is only spread by people trying to discredit women's equality. I feel bad for your mother, sister, girlfriend, and/or wife.

Nerdy and skinny? Ad hominems again, huh? Stick to the argument at hand and stop trying to focus on me so much (I think you have a thing for me tbh). 

Are you saying that ""women [are] sexual objects"" then? Sounds like it. 

Yes, I have. Already stated in previous posts. 

Yes, I have. See academic source that's cited several posts ago at the bottom. 

Ummm what? I'm ""being put on the spot?"" Sorry buddy, but your the one dodging and using opinion pieces with no facts as sources. 

Not making excuses, you are. I've already looked through them multiple times and your posts make me laugh each time. Your the one side stepping relevant information and sources, not me. You won't even address the history of women's right. You won't even acknowledge that men has to **give** the women the **right** to vote. 

Sorry buddy, but it not *my* definition. Go look it up in a dictionary or on the web. I linked to it a while ago, but I'm assuming you avoided the link just like you avoid the facts. 

Sorry, but you've been anything but rational. I'll give it to you that you're consistent - you keep trying to push the same narrative and you've been wrong everytime also, but that it's. It would be nice if you ""boxed [me] into an intellectual corner,"" but that would mean you'd have to be intelligent in order to do so. You've yet to even get me close to one. You, on the other hand, have been pushed into the corner multiple times, but you avoid answering by not acknowledging what I say. 

Sorry, but I'm an atheist. I don't argue in fallacies, stupidity, and just downright bad logic. This is how you argue and what has actually led me to believe that you have no education beyond high school (I'm giving you a lot of credit here). If anything, you're religious - something along the lines of an evangelical. 

Attacking me again because your arguments are weak? Sad. 

Blah blah blah and nothing of substance here. Well that was... that was something. I've never talked to someone this stupid before. This surely has been an interesting experience. 

I have a question: do you always use mental gymnastics or is it just a defense mechanism for always being wrong? Nvm, that doesn't make sense. That question was redundant because you're always wrong therefore you always use it. How silly of me. I guess I answered my own question. ","1372636995"

However, I disagree with protest as a means to resolve the problem. We have to ask ourselves what we want before we settle on a means to resolution. Do we want to uphold our current form of government or do we want to change that? Is it the form of government that is the problem or is it the people representing us in that form of government?

I would argue that it is the people sitting as our leadership. But then why do we keep electing broken records? Why do we tolerate our leadership to act like children bickering over whose turn it is with a toy?

The most valuable tool we have as citizens is our vote. But what good is it if its rusty and ineffective? What makes it rusty and ineffective? The lack of knowledge. 

Far too many of us take to the polls and do zero research and either vote along party lines, or vote for the incumbent. Even worse, we do the same with our judicial system. Almost every election judges run uncontested. Do you think that's because they are just that good at their jobs? No other person in that area wants the job? Obviously not. Makes you wonder doesn't it?

When I said you have more power than me, I mean you're generation is the one that can affect change. 

How? Educate yourself and vote. Ask questions. Write letters to your reps. Confront them when they break campaign promises. And more importantly, challenge ten of your friends to do the same. Challenge them to challenge ten of their friends, and do on. If you think you're vote doesn't count, you might as well accept this whole NSA thing because that's the only way to change things. If our leadership is listening to the people, there will be no NSA and if there is, it becomes a criminal organization.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Okay, first off, this is my passion subject and the area of psychology (Educational Psychology) I'm going into graduate school for. I believe everyone deserves to have unlimited time for testing. One reason they don't is because the teacher/professor is suppose to give a test that everyone is able to complete in that time limit so there won't be the risk of the test conflicting other classes' schedules and avoid the possibility of cheating. Of course, not all educators make test like this... Which pisses me off... And well standardized testing like the ACT/SAT piss me off. This is not the main point of the question and I can ramble about the damaging timed tests to the education system somewhere else...

That aside, I disagree. You have no clue how learning disabilities work-even if you have one, thats how *yours* works for you. I have ADD, a *strong* reading disability, a processing disability, an organizational disability, and short term memory difficulties. I was diagnosed with ADD as a Junior (age 16) in high school and with the rests as a 2nd semester Senior (age 18). I also was a honors student before this. It was frustrating because my regular leveled classes were easy for me, even though I would be the last person who finishes a test. In my honor/AP classes, I did fine keeping up with the work, but once again the tests were difficult and I was always the last one. I clearly knew the info but always felt rushed near the end. Often times, I'd.screw up the bubbling bc I was so rushed. I knew the info, but would be a bubble off or was forced to fill in random bubbles because I ran out of time. 

I started taking medicine during my Junior year, right after my diagnosis. But, at the beginning of my Senior year, I finally got my accomodations. You know how wonderful these were? Finally, I got to actually take a test. My bubbling problem went away, I started doing well on tests, and that was the first semester I got straight A's. Everyone else- they can process quickly. They can focus. They can organize their thoughts, use those techniques of fast test taking, and do well, but I couldn't because my brain *cannot* work that way. I'm not stupid, hell I knew my stuff better than some of the other kids in my AP/honor classes! But because I need do all these extra steps/actions that other people's brains do, I was never given an accurate chance to show my knowledge.  

The way my mind works is first, with focus, I get overwhelming amount of thoughts. The littlest things would stop me from focusing on the test. Some asshole talking in the corner, someone chewing gum, the class on the other side of the thin walls: it was sending useless sensory information to my brain that I do not need but cannot easily block out. And here I am, trying to read the question, and the teacher very oddly worded it. I can read, I was in honor lit classes and english is a strong-point, but somehow my brain cannot accurate process reading as well. So this question doesn't make sense, but that's because I didn't read it properly and trying to figure out what the hell it's asking. It's like trying to understand a person with a strong accent. And then, the organizing. I have so many thoughts in my mind and they all rush out and no matter how I plot it out in my mind, they end up disorganized. Say I'm writing an answer down (I take forever to write)- I know the answer, but I don't know how to say it. It comes out all wrong. I am a good writer, I have practiced writing template after writing template. Still doesn't fix the time problem. I need to sort through my thoughts, write it out physically what I want, and then write it while also focusing on word choice and sentence structure. A simple 3 sentence question can take a while for me because how my brain processes and organizes thoughts and lanuage.

If you say ""sucks for you"", that I'm stupid and won't be successful, I would have to politely beg to differ. Tests and education is *not* a *race*. Your Usain Bolt example does *not* work here. With racing, it is a test of speed. The point is to see how fast a person is.  An education test is suppose to test your knowledge, *not* how fast you can process and recite information. If it was suppose to be a race, students would also be graded on how fast they complete the test, which is pointless. Usain bolt is.demenstrating his running skills in a race. In an academic test, it is demonstrating what knowledge you know and how well you know it. 

Yes, certsin people who might process faster can have an advantage in the world, but so does people who think differently. One of my good friends from high school had an honors english class with me (may I point out, before.my diagnosis). This is a girl who got a 36 on her practice ACT as a sophmore and also thew same score on her actual ACT. She's brilliant. But, in that class, although her and everyone  else in the class were incredibly smart, they couldn't grasp some of the critically thinking our teacher was getting at. In our discussions, I was a frequent particpant and was known to have a very abstract mind. I often would be understanding what my teacher was saying-which was way ahead critical thinking and analysis for my age, *even* for a honors class. May I point out, my district is a pretty good district. I always thought I was bat shit crazy, but.really I was just ahead in those abilities. The fact that I was able to be in advance classes, despite my struggles, while doing decent even shows my proof of ability. Anyone without my condition, their mind allows it to work easier. Imagine you have two people running- they both are doing their best and are dead even with each other. Yet, one of them has a ton of weight bags holding him/her down. Is it fair to let that person continue running with weights? The purpose is suppose to test speed, but the person cannot show their true abilities because he/she has all this weight holding him/her back and making it more difficult. That's what it feels like feels like for me: I'm doing more work, showing outstanding skills, yet no one is acknowledging it. It doesn't mean the other person isn't working hard, but they still don't have the struggle I do.

This struggle, it has made me stronger and I'm glad I'm the way I am. When I went to college, the work was *easier* because I had more freedom with my studying. I already had great study habits, techniques, and self-disapline because that's how I survived in school. It's so much easier to show my skill because of the open-mindedness of my professors. While, I know some of my old fellow classmates are struggling because their mind made it easy for them to do well in HS and on tests. They were the ones who processed fastly, memorized quickly, and would barely pay attention because they didn't need to. They weren't the best at applying their knowledge and instead good at processing it quickly. 
So, honestly, extended time is fair. Although I personally think everyone deserves unlimited time If you know it, you know it. If you don't, you don't. Having longer time won't change that. At most, it might give you time to think critically through it, which is what adults do during problem solving in the real world-and is a very good skill to develop. But saying that you think faster than me means I do not deserve the grades I get with extended time is wrong and discrimatory. I have ever right to a proper education as you. I have every right to demonstrate my skills as much as you. Just because the education system caters to your skills does not make it okay or fair. I have a whole another rant about the discrimation the education does that I won't go into (and very well can later if asked) just understand that it is discrimation.","1372637000"

I'm not saying the movement is ineffective. I just want the movement to make the most effective arguments that will actually bring about change. Trying to scare people about the surgical risk is ineffective. And being against circumcision overall is as closed-minded as forcing circumcision on another person. You will be much less effective if you try to convince someone to not get circumcised. And it's beside the point. It's about an individual's right to be free from forced circumcision.

If a man wants to cut off his foreskin or his earlobe or his lower lip, that's fine with me, as long as that surgery isn't forced upon him by another person. But when you start legislating behavior, and if you start telling people what's good and what's bad for them to do to their own bodies, then you're on a path to failure.

Most guys don't mind that they're circumcised, so focusing on individual rights can frame the debate in the same way that abortion is a debate about a woman's right to choose. Circumcision is a man's right to choose, not his parents'.","1372637005"

Yes, on the RAM upgrade, also it still fits into your initial budget approximately and provides a little bit of future-proofing as well.

Comfort. Got a carry speed recently and it feels so much better than the simple belt my canon came with.

The other big factor is that it allows you to carry it as a shoulder strap, while having the camera hanging on the side **and** being able to access it very fast (just grab it and pull it up). With the normal belt, the problem is that while doing so you pull the belt over the shoulder behind you and it often pulls your t-shirt or doesn't allow you to pull it that fast, while many better camera straps have a mechanism that prevents that.

In the end I would not tell anybody to buy a specific belt, but check out the different ones out there. I was also thinking about the one from Luma Labs, but it was kind complicated to get in Germany.","1372637020"

A textbook gives you that at least and goes some of the way to narrowing the gap - after all a kid who spends an hour working hard from a book probably learns more than a kid who switches off whilst a tutor lectures them. As for the other factors, I disagree with that, assuming its true - but surely that's a case of having more Grammar schools (distance) and coming up with a system, rather than our current policy of ignoring them and hoping they die out.

edit: I should stress that with only three games that utilize the expansion pak, i can't seriously recommend buying it and a Majora, Perfect Dark, or DK64 (that one I REALLY do not recommend), as it'll take up your whole budget unless you go with Perfect Dark. Going with any 3 or 4 of those above is a better deal; for example, Jet Force Gemini is usually $5 on ebay, compared to the for-sure $50 plus you'll pay for Majora's Mask and the expansion pak.","1372637023"

Not technology, but science. Learning about physics (admittedly, in a very limited capacity since I don't have the required math skills) and science in general has definitely had the biggest impact on the way I think and view the world.

&gt; but the quality of the art is undoubtedly objective

No it's not. Art is far too complex to be objective, there are just too many variables to consider. The perception of art entirely depends on the individual who's perceiving it, which by definition makes it subjective.

&gt; They enlightened or enriched our lives in ways that other books haven't

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","* They leased the car and the lease is expiring... unless you negotiated it down, the vehicle purchase price after a lease tends to be fairly high
* New cars are generally safer, they may considerably exceed crash safety performance of older models, or include related features like stability control, pre-crash detection, more airbags, etc.
* The new car has features people want - better tech, more powerful engine, better seats, better gas mileage, etc.
* Notice how most cars seems to get a redesign about every 6 years and a cosmetic facelift every 3 years... some people just want to drive the latest, most stylish car. This year's model. In the 1950s many companies literally had a completely new model every year, that was when exploitation of people's desire to have the latest thing was at its greatest... but that wasn't sustainable. Nowadays they time it so just as your warranty is expiring or that least is ending, there's something shiney and new on the dealer's lot.
* A new car will be under that warranty and while possibly not cheaper in terms of Total Cost of Ownership (since you had to buy the new car and all) it's certainly less hassle to get minor stuff fixed under warranty than fork over for major repairs out-of-pocket as the car gets up there in mileage.
* A car at 3-5 years and 50-100k miles has some value in it, probably 50% of the purchase price or more if you chose a model that retains its value and took good care of it... if you drive it past 200k miles generally the value is close to nil.  It can feel good to buy a car for $30k, sell it yourself for $20k to cut out the dealer's crappy trade-in price, then buy a new one for $30k and get all of the above advantages, plus you seem to recoup a lot of the purchase price of the car.","1372637025"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","If by ""hostile"" you mean ""vocal,"" I agree. Over time, Christians have killed millions of people *for* Christianity. Muslims have killed millions *for* Islam. If an atheist killed people for atheism, it's because they were a dumbass or they were fighting religions the way religions fight religions. Atheism is a pointless name. All that matters to me is that people focus on science and logic above superstitions and judgements. An atheist can be anything, just like Christians and Muslims. My only issue is when people fight/ignore logic/empathy/reason. An atheist could do those things, but they don't do it with a shield of religion that spreads the same ignorance to their children. A genuine atheist would have no reason to indoctrinate their kids, and their kids would have no reason to respect their parents for being irrational. Religion fills in answers for people that shouldn't be filled. People need to be open-minded in order to learn and tolerate others.

&gt;*Another thing I want to know.. if I have LTI on my connie, but I defraud a 300i I bought in game, will I lose my LTI on my connie too, or is it just a penalty to the 300i?*

&gt;*I wouldn't mind gambling on stuff I bought in game, but not things I paid real money for.*

Has it been said that we would even be able to park ships outside of a hanger and go get another ship? It was something I hadn't thought about it till now but I would imagine one would have to fly into a hanger and park up before taking another one of your ships out.

It does surprise me that people seem so intent on figuring out how exploit. I mean it is a good thing for people to think about now as an academic exercise, that way CIG can figure out the best way to mitigate potential exploits in the insurance system, but it wouldn't strike me as fun at all to run exploits in the system rather than play the game and immerse myself.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","The hard money was 3 points, 14% interest only amortized over 30 years, with a 6 month balloon (pretty standard).  I have recently found a hard money lender that does 2.5 points, will refund 1 point if I refi out in 90 days, and 12% interest only amortized over 30 years with a 5 year balloon, which is about as good as it gets in terms of hard money... this lender only works with people with &gt;740 credit score and 6-figure income (or very close), which is why their terms are so much better.

6-12 month seasoning period applies for cash-out refi, but not rate-and-terms refi, which is how you get out of hard money (the lender will let you roll any costs in up to 75% LTV for first 4 loans, 70% for #5-10, but no cash out).

Commercial loan will be a 20-year 3/3 ARM at 5% interest, 2/2/5 caps, 5% floor.  0.5% origination and standard closing fees (0 points).","1372637030"

I'd argue that even this is not true.   You really only need mech bays if you want to collect mechs and keep them.  They are not needed to be competitive.

They aren't even needed to Master every chassis in the game.  You could do that with as little as one mech bay... Though it would cost a lot of cbills that way, since you only get 50% back when selling.

Still.  It is possible for a player to master every non-Hero variant in the game using only the four starter mech bays.

Would you agree there is a difference between believing/not believing and knowing/not knowing something? For example, was I a married man, I could believe my wife not to be cheating on me, without knowing it for sure.

The word theism means ""belief in a deity"". Theist being ""belief in one god"".

So the word atheism stems from 1580, and simply means ""without god"", or ""without belief in a deity"". It does not address knowledge. The question of gnosticism does, and always did, ever since the word was invented.

The fact that most people don't know about this, does not mean it's a new invention. In fact, it's the mistaken idea that agnosticism is a bridge between theism and atheism, that is the newcomer.","1372637040"

“The reason the Japanese butchers didn’t kill the prisoners outright was that in the tropics, with no refrigeration, the meat quickly rotted. So they would just hack off parts of the body to provide a meal without killing the prisoner, then toss him into a ditch, where he would survive another day or two, thereby ensuring that his internal organs remained fresh for later consumption. Ears, noses, lips, cheeks, toes, palms, buttocks, shoulders, and thighs were cut and eaten while the main course remained preserved.”

And you seem to deem yourself more important than the rest of us, and therefore believe you are above these said laws. So basically, not only have you suggested that parking like an idiot is ok, but driving like one is too. 

The fact that no one is unconvinced at the moment is irrelevant because, for one it's the law, two what if a huge hoard of people come to park and that person is now inconveniently taking up two spaces or a disabled spot.

The point is that you are suppose to be respectful of the laws and more importantly, of other drivers and pedestrians. Just because you are feeling lazy doesn't make it right for you to be a dick about your parking. And more importantly, because of how these people park, I believe we can safely say that there is a high probability that they are crappy drivers too. Because if they can't take the extra 30 seconds to park correctly, or walk the extra distance to their car, than we can safely assume that they don't spend the extra effort of being courteous towards other drivers and the traffic laws.

Basically, it matters, and these people deserve to be ticketed/fined. And it sounds like so do you, because I'm sure you're one of these people...

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Tyrion entered the Throne Room, the chain round his neck clinking softly. He had worn a collar during his time in Slavers Bay to show that he was a slave and who he belonged to. Now a chain of golden hands had replaced it, but Tyrion sometimes thought that he might just as well be wearing the collar. His meeting with the queen had begun. 

She was seated on a carved stool beneath the Iron Throne, looking rather innocent in her simple white gown, her hair made into a braid. The skulls of the dead dragons looked down on her from the walls, having been retrieved from the cellar in which they had been kept, once she had conquered Kings Landing. Tyrion crossed the room, taking note of the Queensguard standing on either side of their queen at a few feet’s distance. 

“Your Grace.” He said, bowing in front of her.

“Ah, Lord Tyrion”, she said in a sweet tone, “I´ve summoned you here to speak about an important matter.”

Tyrion was not to be fooled by her charm. Their meetings always started out pleasantly enough, but when he touched upon a matter Daenerys did not want discussed, it could take a nasty turn. 

“Please sit down.” 

She indicated towards Tyrion´s council chair, which was placed to the side of the queen. 

“I´ll have some wine brought” 

She waved her hand at one of the servants standing close to the wall and the young man quickly scampered off.  Tyrion seated himself and turned himself towards the queen.

“Your Grace, what matters would you like to discuss with me today?”

“I´ve had a raven from Highgarden. They still don’t seem to want to bend the knee. I´m considering marching to war against them and showing them that a Targaryen is not to be defied.”

An evil smile played across her lips, one that Tyrion had seen before and come to be fear. 

“If you are to go to war with Highgarden, I would strongly advise against using your dragons. Highgarden is a good source of food, one that you don´t want burned to ashes. Also you want the people of Highgardens support, one that is best gained without setting their homes on fire”

Daenerys eyes grew hard.

“Highgarden will be an example for the world what power House Targaryen has. Maybe that will make the other pretenders bend the knee more freely. I will have the place burned to the ground if I so must, as long as Westeros knows I´m not to be defied.”

“But Your Grace, the orchards-” Tyrion began.

“I do not care about any orchards. Dragons plant no trees.”

That was true. Since her arrival in Westeros, Daenerys had been the embodiment of the words of House Targaryen. She had reached havoc across the lands, first taking Kings Landing, before crushing any lord in the area that would not bend the knee. And as if that was not enough, she wanted revenge on anyone who had been involved on the wrong side of Robert´s Rebellion, having the names of all the wrong doers taken from what her brother had told her during their years of fleeing. Luckily for Tyrion, he himself had been spared, but he had a notion of what was going to happen to the rest of the Lannsiters of Casterly Rock once this madwoman got her hands on them.  Daenerys was not the benevolent queen he had been told of when traveling for Meereen, something had changed in her after her time in the Dothraki Sea. It must have been the tipping point, like Duskendale for King Aerys, which resulted in her plummeting into madness. She had also not acknowledged the fact that the second supposed Targaryen, Aegon, might be to her help; instead she denounced him as one of the other pretenders. Tyrion thought back on the boy he had travelled with, the person who had saved him from drowning in the Sorrows. He had been slightly arrogant and hotheaded, but also well educated and altogether a fairly decent cyvasse player, even though he overused his dragons. A bit like Daenerys, at least in the last aspect. 

The wine arrived, brought in by a cupbearer and both Tyrion and Daenerys were served. Tyrion was thankful for the interruption, though he knew that he could only avoid the full out confrontation for so long. He stared at the wine for a while, knowing it´s true properties. He took a sip. 

“So my lord hand”, Daenerys said drinking large amounts of wine, “I plan on attacking Highgarden and I would like you to assist me with the plans.”

Of course. She had ignored Tyrion´s counsel as so many times before. The dragon queen was getting harder to control. The day would come when she would listen to no sense and reason and then Westeros would truly bleed. If the wine had it´s desired effect that would never come to happen. He took another sip of his wine.

“I would like to discuss it with the Council on the morrow”, she said, “but I first thought I would breach the subject with you.”

“I´m honoured, Your Grace.”

“I will use Drogon in the conquest of Highgarden. House Targaryen must be feared. I have no more matters to discuss.”

“Your Grace.” Tyrion finished his wine and stood up. “I wish you a good evening.”

He bowed before leaving, walking as fast as he could. He could feel his head starting to swim, his vision becoming blurred. He thought of how he had been accused for poisoning Joffrey, when he had actually been innocent and now that he actually was attempting regicide someone else was bound to get the blame. The Kingsguard and the servants had seen him drink the same wine as Daenerys so he could not be blamed.  Now we have two members in the family who have killed regents, he thought. Jaimie is just as bad as me. Though I suppose he didn´t kill his own father, so at least he doesn´t have kinslaying to worry about. Tyrion stumbled up the steps of the Tower of the Hand. At this point his head was pounding and he felt as if his chest might explode. He forced himself to ascend the steps, his stomache heaving with each step. He barely managed to open the door to his chambers, though luckily there were no guards around to see. He fell to his knees and had to crawl on all fours until he reached the fireplace. He removed the loose stone and retrieved the vial within. With shaking hands he drew out the stopper and swallowed the foul-tasting contents within. “For the realm”, he thought, before passing out.





Tyrion wins.

"TeraOnline","t5_2s527","**I wrote a paragraph summarizing each of the four melee classes' PvP usefulness. They all vary greatly, giving you a clear decision based on how you enjoy playing. As a disclaimer, I main a VM warrior and have a geared Slayer alt, so this post is within that perspective.**

Lancers are tanks with scary burst damage for their durability, but their biggest strength is their control. Extremely strong slows against other melees (including their attack speed) and a skill called gigachain that *pulls 5 targets to a single location and stuns them* makes them extremely desirable in literally every format of PvP. The downside is their burst is fairly maintainable by itself and they're the least threatening class to have stuck to you while their gigachain is on cooldown (which is for close to a minute). Regardless, they're the front-line workhorses for large-scale PvP. In 3s, your giga-chain is basically an ""I win"" button if your team can capitalize on it, working strongly both offensively and defensively to save your teammates. Your strong slows and other chains make peeling a breeze, giving your team plenty of breathing room. Most people consider the class the best at dueling since there's literally nothing they don't have, even a self-heal and a damage-absorb skill. Lancers are easily the most self-reliant class.

Warriors are durable like Lancers, having the second highest HP in the game and the best defense for leathers even in assault stance. Four of their skills even give them pure %damage reduction while mid-cast (20%, 30%, 50%, 50%). They have considerable mobility and attack speed. Their damage is lacking, but they have really long stun chains and staggers galore that compensate entirely for it, to the point where any warrior worth the gear they're made of can do [things like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=8NIzJTtoZaU). The class is highly desirable for 3v3 due to their ability to tunnel a target to death with ease, the skill Cascade of Stuns applying an AoE stun to any would-be peels. Their extreme mobility and control make them excellent peelers as well. Their control lets them easily set up kills for their other DPS. The downside is that a warrior's effectiveness drastically drops off in larger-scale fights (anything over 5v5 really) where their effectiveness at tunneling is countered by the massive amount of peeling at a team's disposal. Their damage is too gradual with so many healers, and their AoE damage is a joke. Their control can still be used to cause back-line disturbance, but they lose a lot of thunder relative to other classes and risk quickly dying in the back without support. Combining a Warrior and Lancer with a healer for 3v3 is considered a ""cheese comp"" due to the ridiculous strength of these two classes.

Slayers are if warriors lost a chunk of everything that made them good, but gained a shitload of damage in return. Delicate, only mild control, less mobility, very slow skills, able to 2-shot people. Considered top-tier DPS for PvE, but a lot of people are disappointed in the class at the moment for PvP due to a stun being removed, making it harder to completely dominate opponents by themselves, usually requiring another class to support them to achieve their goals. The class is simplistic at first with quite a potential for depth, more so than a warrior. This makes the difference between a good and bad slayer quite huge, giving you a chance to really stand out with this class. This class's wide AoEs that knock down enemies make them strong for mass-PvP and Battlegrounds, though a bit delicate for the job they're designed to do. A lot of people consider them poor duelists and 3v3 partners, though skill within the class varies greatly and a very good slayer can be quite viable.

Beserkers are a polar-opposite to warriors. They are slow, they are immobile, they wear plate and can block but have the second-lowest base HP in the game making them between warriors and slayers for durability. They have little control. They can 1-shot. They can crit in PvE for millions; they can 1-shot everything but lancers in PvP if given the chance. As you can guess, this means they're a very mixed bag that makes them hard to use, but extremely rewarding when things align. They're opposite to warriors in effectiveness too being very strong in mid-size to large-scale battles where they can weave through their teammates, pick their prey, 1-shot, and move back to safety. A skilled beserker in 1v1 can be a serious threat to ALL melees but are a complete joke against ranged classes. They're considered piss-poor for 3v3s due to the abundance of warriors and lancers and their ability to punish a beserker's weakness to control.","1372637049"

Re-read /u/Goononthemoon 's comment. It clearly states the problem with this mechanic. Doesn't matter if it's normal mode or hardcore mode - the problem remains the same. Maybe players should only be unrevivable when someone shoots them in the head again AFTER they've died? Or instead of making them unrevivable - make them revive with less health.

.

In regards to features like complete lack of HUD: Again, BF is not designed for that. For example, if there's no HUD - how do you check your ammo? IRL you can take out the magazine and count the bullets. In BF you'd need a separate feature and sets of animations just for that one mechanic. I doubt DICE would spend time and effort adding something that will not be used by 95% of the players.

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","I suffered serious acid reflux for years until I solved the problem myself with a series of exercises I developed myself.   Basically you have to practice mindful swallowing where you can feel the contractions going right down to the top of your stomach.  Try to develop better control over the individual muscles without having to actually swallow.  Normally the muscles go in a chain reaction so you have to try to make them work outside of the chain reaction.   Once you can do this you can work at pulling your esophagus up out of your stomach.   Depends on the type of acid reflux you have but in most cases your esophagus hangs down through your sphincter at the top of the stomach, so it can't close properly.  Basically you can get control of your muscles and start pulling that up out of there manually.

Took me basically a whole year of practice but it worked well.   And after that it went away for good so I did not have to keep doing the exercises.","1372637053"

Fun fact: the people that feel bad about having their code criticized should feel bad because their code sucks. If they continue to resist towards the end of my contract, I simply add their names to the list of employees who will be fired. Nice and simple.

"tabletopgamedesign","t5_2szh7","My RPG, tentatively titled Counterspell, is coming along slow but steady. My main bottleneck in development is not having a place available for regular testing.

The game itself is a d10 system built around flexible character design and custom spells/abilities. Other notable features include a non-linear turn order based on action points, easily moddable attributes, and a trait mechanic which acts as a GM-approved catch-all character customizer. I've had the basic framework hammered out for a while, now. I'm just working on balancing and ""feel,"" which is why the lack of testing is becoming a burden on the project. It's intended to be setting-neutral, and I have some plans for a rule-modding guide, as well as some setting-specific expansions.

If/when it gets finished, I intend to distribute it for free. This project is really just for me and my friends, I don't expect to profit off of it. The RPG market is pretty saturated already.","1372637065"

Like how when New Coke came out people whined and insulted till Coca cola gave up on trying to act like nothing was wrong.

The hugely increasing dislike bars are fans saying, we don't like this direction, and if it doesn't change we will take our time elsewhere. I like New Grumps, but people are totally justified in telling the producers what they want to see if the producers want to keep getting money off their views, and often you have to scream and bang your heads on the table to get producers to listen, as shown by Xbox One.","1372637066"

If you were asked out, ask what they're having and eat something equal to or lower in price so if they do pay you're not the ass eating lobster while he's having a burger

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz","1. I was walking one morning to my place of internship in the July heat, feeling sweaty and grumpy. An old guy on the side of the street asked me for water. Initially I thought nothing of it, shrugged him off and moved on. A block later, I started feeling bad and thinking: usually these poor people want money to buy alcohol or drugs, but this guy just asked for water. Strange. I went to the store, bought a 1-liter bottle and doubled around to return to him. Gave it to him and had a brief, pleasant discussion. Turns out he was a Vietnam vet and had some great stories to tell.

2. Hmm. I coincidentally happened to come across my friend one night, he had slipped off his motorbike just moments ago, and was bleeding profusely. I called the ambulance and sat at his side all the way from that dark road to the entrance of the operating room. I kept checking up on him every few days until his recovery.

3. As an undergrad, I used to work in a psychology lab where we studied the behavior of mice. At the end of the experiments, the mice were routinely killed. I grew close to one little female mouse during an experiment, and after it was completed I didn't have the heart to kill her. I smuggled her outside and let her loose. I don't know how generous this is since she'd probably die in the wild anyway... but I figure at least she has a fighting chance as opposed to being gassed to death in a lab room.

4. I've volunteered pretty extensively for a hospice, basically a lot of old (and sometimes younger) people who are dying and need comfort. Occasionally there'll be a patient whose family doesn't care enough to come, or they have no family. I'll spend extra time sitting with them, playing cards with them, listening to their stories, etc.","1372637068"

Long story short i caught them together and things got heated i stood up to him for her when he tried going after her which led to her jumping in front if him screaming in my face that she loved him. I left and received a call from her hours later, crying, begging me not to hurt him, I hung up on her.

The biggest limitation isn't technological even, it's tactile response.  You're expecting people to go through a virtual world with no tactile response in regards to the environment.  For most people, it's a no go.  It becomes less immersive because there is a constant reminder that the world is not real, it's a construct and you can simply walk into a tree and keep on walking.  Your character might not move, but there isn't anything physically stopping you.  Aside from that, complex controls would likely suffer.  Using Kinect style technology can only get you so far and you'd really need an array of similar cameras to catch all motion of the player and really give it the kind of accuracy players would demand (it would also be expensive).

After doing even more research I found it to be a little more personal that even that, and deserved a sort of respect and love and care that you would give a human person (though I am still under the school of thought that Tulpa are not 'person' but the subconscious self that has been superimposed onto a person of choice)

West was made because I have crippling self confidence issues. I have a hard time handling stressful and sad situations, and at times I have a horrible disconnect with people who are sad or upset. I am very impersonal. Each time I started with a voice of my own design they were degrading towards me, so instead I worked with a character and archetype I knew I would enjoy the company of and would enjoy me regardless.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Similar then to pre-emphasis used in FM radio. Although that is standard in all receivers.

&gt;Random noise has a triangular spectral distribution in an FM system, with the effect that noise occurs predominantly at the highest frequencies within the baseband. This can be offset, to a limited extent, by boosting the high frequencies before transmission and reducing them by a corresponding amount in the receiver. Reducing the high frequencies in the receiver also reduces the high-frequency noise. These processes of boosting and then reducing certain frequencies are known as pre-emphasis and de-emphasis, respectively.

&gt;The amount of pre-emphasis that can be applied is limited by the fact that many forms of contemporary music contain more high-frequency energy than the musical styles which prevailed at the birth of FM broadcasting. They cannot be pre-emphasized as much because it would cause excessive deviation of the FM carrier. Systems more modern than FM broadcasting tend to use either programme-dependent variable pre-emphasis; e.g., dbx in the BTSC TV sound system, or none at all.","1372637092"

Ugh. Do you understand how this sounds? First off, answer this: What are you getting off on? The wild sex? The non-sexual violence? Or both?

If it's the wild sex, I assure you, this isn't limited to physically violent women. If you're getting off on the violence (and I think there's more than a hint of this with your description of technique), you can do this in a consensual manner rather than in the context of these little domestic violence scenes you seem to have going on. What you described above sounds like a crime (in many jurisdictions, there is no claim of self defense if you can escape, for example). 

Most likely, you're a kid who's feeding up red meat on reddit. But seriously, any time you find yourself SERIOUSLY thinking about domestic violence techniques, you're headed in a direction that could get you in some pretty serious legal trouble. 

So either quit giving crap advice or sort yourself out - only you know which is applicable.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","You can say what you believe like how you are now. You are not being offensive, but it does go against the very core of my beliefs. Am I being offended? No. Are you? No, given that you are replying without being an emotional wreck. This very discussion is proof against your very claim. We are having a discussion in a calm and collected way, expressing our thoughts. I'm not offended at your beliefs and you are not offended at mine. So the fact that you are responding to me and I to you, proves that you are wrong, since this form of discussion DOES and CAN take place and it IS taking place.

Now surely, you cannot deny reality. All I'm asking for is more people like you to express themselves in a respectable ways.

&gt; The beliefs here include things like ""almost all non-Muslims both 1. will be tortured for eternity, and 2. deserve it, since God's decisions on who to send to hell are just."" 

First of all, your theology is wrong in that you seem to depict people being sent to hell for no reason. Maybe i'm reading into it, maybe not. Whatever.

Secondly, just because I believe disbelievers will go to hell if he dies in disbelief doesn't mean they should be offended, especially when they don't *believe* in a hell. If someone is genuinely convinced there is no afterlife, the most he or she can think is, ""What a moron, lol, he thinks I'm going to a non-existent place."" If they are going to be genuinely offended despite not believing in hell, then they are horribly sensitive and probably should never social with anyone given that anything different than their own beliefs upsets them. So forget politics, forget philosophy, and forget critical thinking altogether. I find your argument least convincing.

&gt; we should sometimes be willing to talk about religions in ways that are offensive to their adherents, just like those adherents should be able to talk about their religion in ways that are offensive to non-believers.

I disagree, based on the fact that your premise paints all non-believers as overly sensitive people.

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","So, last week I split up with a great girl I'd met on OKC that I'd had pretty strong feelings for; however, it wasn't a terribly long or serious thing (maybe 4 months?), so although it stung initially it's not as bad currently.

Anyway, I thought I'd get back on OKC and reactivated my account, and ended up going on 2(.5?) dates this week.

1st girl: Drinks, at a bar near me. A fair bit younger than me, but she was intelligent and we had a lot of shared interests. Early on she warned me that she sometimes unintentionally ""bowled over"" the other person in a conversation in terms of doing most of the talking, which turned out to be slightly prophetic, but not really obnoxiously so. We stayed a while, we (mostly I) got a bit tipsy, we went back to my place but not much happened, and she didn't stay over. She's gone for the weekend, but I wouldn't mind seeing her again, especially as we seem pretty similar and she lives literally a block away, coincidentally...

2nd girl: Drinks; same bar, last night. This one was a lot more interesting. We had a really snappy conversation beforehand, and I was looking forward to seeing her. Had finished a masters, then dropped out of law school. She was extremely attractive; probably one of the hottest girls I'd gone out with on OKC. We had a raunchy but free-flowing convo, and overall good rapport.

It was a brewpub bar, and she revealed that she didn't like beer too much, so I suggested we go to a nearby wine/martini bar. By this time we'd been drinking for a few hours (I was a few pints in, she had had maybe half a pint due to kind of disliking beer, which makes the fact that she chose to order beer a bit odd, I suppose). We left for the second bar, and I jokingly warned her that the drinks at the second location were pretty strong, and that by the time we left the second bar I would probably be too drunk to properly make a move on her, so I'd better do so beforehand. She seemed to like that, we ended up making out aggressively up against the outside wall of the bar we'd ostensibly been heading to, and instead headed back to my place. 

Things were great, but there are a couple of things that have me worried:

- She deactivated her account today, after (I think) one day on OkC
- She told me EVERYTHING (seemingly) about herself and her past, and while I really appreciate her openness, it did seem odd to be that completely open about SUPER intimate stuff that quickly.
- Her parents live in the US but came back here to Canada just to ""check on her"" and ""make sure she's okay""; why? The law drop-out thing, or some other stuff she's not mentioning?
- She mentioned a recent ""fuck buddy""-type relationship in which she became disinterested with the guy after he fooled around with someone else (which is sort of implicitly okay in a FB thing, I would think?), and it made me concerned that if she expected a FB that she'd been with once to not fool around with anyone else, maybe she'd have the same expectation of us after our pretty-intimate first date...? So I was sort of forced into having a kind of ""I like you but this is still a first date, let's take this easy"" kind of conversation with her, which she seemed receptive to. Anyway, I told her I'd call her again, and I will, so I'll see how that goes.


2.5?: An 'ex' (sort-of) that I used to have a thing with contacted me today out of nowhere wanting to hang out. She works right next to me (I guess my location is apparently pretty convenient for dating, based on these stories) and asked if I wanted to go to her place for some drinks with her and her roommates. We've gone out/fooled around in the past, and I've had strong feelings for her that have since cooled slightly, so I don't know what the context is here or what's going to happen.

**TL;DR: recently got out of a good but brief relationship, got back into OKC dating, had a couple of promising dates, about to leave for some unknown thing with an old flame.**","1372637104"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","I've met a couple of somewhat logical women in my life, perhaps around 3, and yes, they too result in emotional appeals to shit. It's annoying. A guy I can discuss some shit with for hours and not once will he try to shame/guilt or otherwise attack me psychologically, he'll give reasons, examples etc and only attack me if I don't acknowledge his line of reasoning as valid with an equally valid reason for why his line of reasoning is incoherent or flawed. Men can be pedantic for the sake of clarity, especially intellectual men, and I notice that non-native english speakers are even more pedantic because their mother tongues have words which English doesn't, more specific words, such as one specific word for ""being deceptive in order to obtain sex"" rather than that whole block of text I just typed in English to describe it, however, when women give up on logic they become petty, they'll find any little hole in what you said, an incorrect date, an incorrect usage of a word or whatever and zone in on that, essentially digressing the entire topic onto an insignificant tangent in order to ""make them feel"" like they're not losing the argument, but really, they've just derailed the intellectual integrity of the exchange into a nihilistic void.

Classic segment of an argument with my college sweetheart (an ex)

- Me: ""you can use logic, you've done it plenty of times, so why do you refuse to use it now?""
- Her: ""fuck logic, logic's overrated, logic can't solve everything!""

...I think you'll find it can. Your solipsistic emotions won't solve everything though, however.
This was a woman who I'd consider far smarter than the average woman you meet out and about. Speaks for itself, really. Even more logical women have less endurance for rationality, it bores them them to a point of incapability, it's almost as if they're in pain living in a paradigm when there's a lack of emotion, almost as if they need the energy of some emotion, any emotion so they can embellish like a morbidly obese man in a doughnut shop and get the fuel to thrive and activate dopamine hits in their limbic system, without it they resort to creating drama to getting those emotions. That's why ignoring them works so well, you give them nothing, no emotion, nothing good or nothing bad - they fucking hate it and they have no emotions to work with. Once you go into emotional territory when it comes to intellectual pursuits, you may as well hand her the trophy for winning. She's more interested in **feeling smarter than you** than she is interested in **actually BEING smarter than you.**

Don't think smart women with a modicum of logic are an exception (common misconception men seem to have, holding out for a non-existent unicorn) because they're not. All women are like this. Very rare I say such a thing as so concrete but I've not seen a scrap of evidence to the contrary.","1372637111"

"Unity3D","t5_2qwj8","This is the same background I came from, and initially I was very reluctant to use an engine at all, convinced I should make my own instead. But at some point you get to the whole, ""if you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe"" point, for me, that was when I was trying to rewrite my 3d engine in assembly. I realized I could spend my time making all my own tools from scratch, or I could spend my time making games. 

Having the ability to do it from scratch is the good part, especially since, as you'll discover, Unity is *very, very* modular, and you can edit and extend huge chunks of the program itself. It's not open source, but it's as close as you can get while maintaining high enough quality and production standards to be able to deploy to virtually every major modern platform (consoles computers and mobile whaaa).

So yeah, give it a fair shake, if you get frustrated with something's limited functionality (I don't think you will, honestly), code a library or editor extension and stick it up in the asset store.","1372637113"

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt; Pretending the whole world runs on fossil fuels is as wrong as pretending the whole world doesn't.

When less than 5% of all countries in the world produce enough nuclear power to even have a measurable impact on their country, it's not an unfair statement to say that the world still largely runs on fossil fuels. As I said before, only 10 countries have a third or more of their power produced by nuclear energy. We are talking about an overwhelming minority in the grand scheme of things. 

&gt;Saying all the power comes from fossil fuels adds nothing to the discussion, focusing on the exceptions and alternatives builds a discourse.

*Lying* about the availability of nuclear power adds nothing to the discussion. I was simply pointing out that the world still largely relies on fossil fuels, don't get mad because someone called you on your uninformed bullshit. You're not doing anything positive by using hyperbole to describe how commonplace nuclear power is. There are many better to focus on the alternative power and their potential benefits than to lie/spread false information about them.

Generally the closer you are to city center the higher lodging prices are. Consider possibly staying in an extended stay, possibly with a reasonable train ride further from main NYC. 

A small kitchenette and a fridge in suite means you get at least a cheap breakfast every day. Unless you eat like a rabbit meals will be $10-15 each.

After these expenses I'd still want $50/day minimum to do stuff. I'd add another $50/day for nicer meals, a show, alcohol, etc.

What? A good MiG-15 pilot will absolutely wipe the floor with a Sabre, the Sabre will just find himself on the deck, low and drained of energy before he knows what the hell happened. Most Sabres I fight just try to run, which'll never really work, or they try to zoom climb to you and sit on their turbine. The Sabre also needs to do *one* mistake and it'll be shredded completely by the cannons on the MiG.

If I fly my MiG to it's full potential (which I do rarely) I absolutely destroy everything on the opposition. There really is nothing that can beat the climb and acceleration it has.

At that, right now, the MiG will turn decently with the Sabre at most speeds/altitudes, and will outturn the Sabre at high altitude, which it was in real-life. The edge the Sabre had in turning was the lack of nasty spin characteristics and G-suits, which gave the impression of better turning IRL. The Sabre will win the horizontal, though, depending on how it's done. It also has a better airbrake, which adds to the initial turning ability as it drops speed quicker than the MiG.","1372637126"

It would have made sense if the writer set up Gwyn Paltrow as an envious character, giving consistency to her death, and following up John Doe's execution as a punishment for killing six other people. It would have given more creedence to his philosophy, and disturb the audience with the idea that John Doe isn't insane, but rather an advocate for retribution, punishment, and judgement, but no: he's just nuts.

  I think it really comes down to the tendency for franchise fans to want to add their favorite elements without always thinking it through all the way, it would not be unlike a writer saying ""Hey, I fucking love BSG, my Star trek is going to be BSG!"" or ""My show is going to be based on Starfleet's first quantum slipstream equipped battleship in the year 2560, it is crewed by every awesome alien ever and it is going to go to the Delta quadrant to destroy what is left of the Borg"".

"CompanyOfHeroes","t5_2rn3p","The problem I find with these debates over meta game balance is people tend to get hung up over the performance of units and ignore the matter of cost effectiveness.

Your post addresses the fact that German late game units are better than their Soviet counterparts, and that some of the doctrine abilities are capable of shutting down Soviets but nowhere in your rant have you talked about the actual costs and prerequisites of these units. 

Make no mistake, there are big gaps in the Soviet meta game that are wide open to exploitation such as the early game flame track rush and the loss of the T34 as an effective tool for neutering enemy tanks, but you aren't really talking about the real reasons why these are a problem, the matter of cost vs field effectiveness.

During closed beta the T34 was maligned as the single most op thing in the game by German players, in spite of the fact it's stats were worse than they are in the current build. This is because it only cost 75 fuel, massively increasing the Soviet's ability to spam n' ram enemy armor, denying them the ability to field stronger units. In the event that the soviet player destroyed any enemy tank, he did so at a great profit margin over his opponent regardless of whether or not he lost his expendable 34 in the process. In today's build you cannot throw your 34 at enemy tanks and make a worthwhile return in the process due to their increased cost bringing them in line with German T3 armor.



There's more to meta game balance than the simple matter of what unit beats what. Yes, it's important, but the most critically overlooked factor is cost effectiveness.","1372637132"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","From what I saw before I fell asleep (not because the games were boring, but NA+EU LCS is exhausting to stay up for) Westrice hasn't changed and MeyeA needs to be benched. Westrice is a solo queue god, but still doesn't understand in LANs, you can't make high volatility decisions that may give you a big advantage or throw the game for your team. You need to chip away at enemy team and only get aggressive when you know you have the enemy team's balls on a plate. And MeyeA &gt;.&lt; I love all of coL including him as people, but with the acquisition of MegaZero, if they want to take getting into the LCS seriously, they need to find a support that is more on everyone's skill level. I still haven't seen Chuuper on AD with the team, and from what I've seen from Pr0lly, I've liked overall. Everyone needs to do some work. But I think by now, if MeyeA hasn't improved much, he'll never be LCS material. He constantly makes super bad decisions that baits the rest to follow up in a bad engagement. When Chuuper originally got benched, it's because they team needed a scapegoat, and skillwise, it was him or MeyeA, but throwing mid costs the team more than a support that throws. NickWu got benched because he was slacking off. I believe these two situations were unavoidable and any team would've done the same. If for not these two extremes, the whole team would still be intact since coL is more of a family than a team. I have to assume MeyeA is still on the team because he has a great attitude and tries his best, but his best is not good enough. Hard to root for a team when you know this one player will prevent them from being where they should be. But whatever. They are a fan favorite, and if they choose to keep him, I'll love the fact such a team will be in challenger FOREVER. Challenger needs some love.","1372637132"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok I got one - story time I guess... Kinda NSFW. 

So a few years ago I went out to Tenerife for a vacation with my friends, we had a friend (we'll call him John) who was working out there for seasonal work and suggested we come over and see him. 

Well we arrived in Tenerife and went to see John, he was renting an apartment with a female friend (Steph). She was absolutely stunning but John assured me she was just a co-worker and it was completely platonic. 

So anyway, were chilling at John and Steph's place and getting drunk and stupid. Steph leaves the room and I notice a notebook on the coffee table. I flick through it, not thinking much of it, until I hit 2 pages of scribbling. Steph had been keeping a diary of sorts it seems. I skim through. ""Doggy"".... ""finish off""... ""naked"". This is some juicy shit, yo. 

Drunken me realises I don't have time to read it all before Steph comes out of the bathroom, so I come up with the genius plan to take a photo of the filthy, smutty scrawling to read later. Boom, I take a pic and put the notebook back, no-one is any the wiser. 

Now I wasn't kidding when I said this was some juicy shit. She explained how she had brought back two guys one night and got double teamed by them but one of them was too big for her so had to finish on her face. Go go gadget boner. 

We had a great vacation and after a week of partying it up, we came home. I give my camera to my tech savvy and bored brother to upload all these awesome memories onto Facebook. Guess what photo got posted. 

Needless to say, Steph hates me. ","1372637133"

Given this neutrality, there is no need to gather any data regarding the two paths and you would not bother doing so. This, in and of itself, reveals your complete neutrality regarding the fork in the road.

By the same token, there is perfect neutrality in many endeavors. There are attempts to form biases and preferences, but it is disingenuous to presume you are never perfectly neutral. Many choices presuppose that no normative criteria dictating what one should do exist.

In response to your part about the govenor being an overly psychotic mental case; while I can see what you mean they actually go into quite a lot of detail about what made him like he is in a couple of side novels (not the comics I'm aware but they do go into quite a lot of backstory about him which explains many of the points such as his wavering control of woodberry and his introduction of the gladiator matches to try and regain control, along with his descent into insanity as he deals with the loss of his friends and family).
Your point about the no-win scenarios is also true but the TV show was just as bad (if not worse) with this, but then this is the case with most of your other points as well.

My intention wasn't specifically to defend the comics or Kirkman's writing ability so much as ask what about them was WORSE than the TV series (though I will admit the ""We are the walking dead!"" speech was truly awful).","1372637140"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; So you don't think it's discriminatory that one class of people is granted the right to marry the people they are attracted to and love (and who love them back), while the other class isn't?

It is discriminatory in a casual sense. But not in a legal sense. Because it's not the legally-recognized purpose of marriage to marry someone you're sexually attracted to. If you trying to assert the principle that we should have the right to marry those we're attracted to then you must not have thoroughly considered the consequences of such a principle.

&gt; It's also recognized that one cannot change their sexuality

The comparison was not between race and sexuality, it was between race and marrying someone of the same gender, which *is* a choice. The point is racial discrimination is, at the very least, more severe than discrimination for the reason you have married someone of the same gender -- because race isn't something you can change and your choice of who to marry can be changed.

&gt; Similarly homosexuals are being denied a privilege granted to hetereosexuals for the sole reason of being homosexual. So what's your point?

No they're not. What is the privilege being denied? You can't say it's the privilege of marrying someone you're attracted to because there is no right to marry who you're attracted to. There is a right to marry someone of the opposite gender.

&gt; We don't have to enter your proposed ""slippery slope"". We are talking about the right to marry a consenting adult. The right to marry a person of age, whom you are attracted to and in love with under the condition that the person is consenting to the marriage.

Look at your contortions here. You're saying the right to marry a consenting human adult who is not related to you is not discriminatory, but the right to marry a consenting human adult *of the opposite gender* who is not related to you *is* discriminatory. The ""correct"" marriage right is not some elegant statement of equality, it's still riddled with exceptions.

&gt; Every argument against homosexual marriage so far, can equally be made for making interracial marriages illegal. Imagine a law (you don't have to imagine, just look some years back) that states:
&gt;&gt;Every person has the right to marry a person of different gender and same race.
&gt;So do you think that interracial marriages should have stayed illegal, too? Or where do you see the difference?

For one thing, your phrasing of the restriction on interracial marriage was not the kind of law that was ruled unconstitutional. In *Loving v. Virginia* a law was struck down that prevented only *white people* from marrying other races. That violated the 14th amendment.

More to the point, I do think uniformly-applied bans on interracial marriage are problematic. *But not because they violate equal protection* (though mixed race people may be an exception, depending on how the law handles them). Do you think uniformly-applied bans on interracial marriage violate equal protection? If so, how does that argument go? You cannot point to a race that is treated differently than another race under such a rule.","1372637140"

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","If bronze 5 is your skill level, abusing a strong strategy will get you points but you're not addressing the core issue, which is improving as a player. This can be mechanical or game related and I highly encourage you to improve as a player rather than abuse solo queue. I know high gold players who are downright awful but abused solo queue to get there (I'm gold 4 for the record).

However, with that out of the way...the things you can easily abuse in solo queue are lack of communication, lack of objective control (due to communication), snowball champs and lack of wards (all levels dont ward enough, people are too greedy for their builds)

So stealth and mobility abuses the first. Jungle eve or junglers/mids with mobi boots (lee sin, naut, mao, zac have good gap closers to abuse with speed). Eve taxes the support and most supports don't even realise that green wards are a waste. They are forced from an early level to pink and need to do it all game. As a support main, this is one of the most frustrating things because I have no build and get yelled at for no aegis at 35 mins (i ward a lot of key points in their jungle, which you should do past 20 mins). Mobility means that warding needs to be deeper (enemy tri if on blue side, golems if on purple side) in addition to normal wards. Taxes the support and can catch people off guard.

Objective control. Tell your jungle to come gank bot around 10 mins (they should be 6 at this point), have a pink in your inventory and go do drag. 10min drag means extra gold for everyone AND the next spawn is around 16 mins, towards the end of laning but potentially allowing for a third at 22 mins which gives a good gold lead if you do ok in laning and grab them. Pinking drag and warding around it with a few enemies down is all you need.

Snowball champs. Things like Riven, Renekton, assassins, jungle nunu and Jayce are all very strong for beating your lane and snowballing the mid game with the enemy team raging. 3 of my friends all hit gold just by abusing these champs (one is almost plat with riven, renekton and jayce. He is very good, but abused solo queue). They abuse strong early-mid games, usually tanky or forgiving since you get so far ahead.

Lack of wards. Top buys one, mid might buy one, jungler might buy one, support gets sightstone. Its not enough. When I do 5's, top, mid and jungle frequently have 2 wards at all times for jungle warding, allowing us to know where the jungle is before he even thinks of going there. Solo queue, a dash over a wall, a well placed pink or even mobi boots makes quick work of wards.","1372637141"

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","1. Turn of ""All Chat"". This lets you focus on your game and leaves your chat clutter free allowing you to be more organized seeing things like timers and itemization paths.

2. Learn champs that have multiple paths or roles. To name a few, Ryze can play Top + Mid, Jarvan can play Top + Jungle, Twitch can play Mid + Bot. I find that at any Elo, you will find that odd game where someone also wants to play the same role as yourself, so it's worth being able to switch roles or lanes.

3. Be able to play all 5 roles. You cannot play ranked while only being able to play the roles you like.  What I hate the most is finding people arguing they can only play 2 roles but want to rise to Challenger without being universally knowledgeable.

4. That being said, know your limits. I played Lee Sin top as fill thinking it would be just as easy as Jungle also tied with the fact that Wukong is countered by him. I was proved wrong when we lost and got continually bashed by my team. After this, I learned my lesson to specifically tell my team my best roles to my least to leave no surprises in game (and no, saying your support skills are soo bad then saying you cannot support is not an excuse)


5. Be knowledgeable of the roles and be a jack of all trades. You can specialize or be better in some, just be aware of at least 3 champions per role and what they are capable of in game. 

6. There is something called OP, but no shortcuts to success. Just practice and get better. Some champions may be stronger and easier to pick up (like Nasus and Nocturne jungle) but beyond that is all skill.","1372637143"

So I bought one of those 50% 'heroic boosts' for my TR main, and that's helped a bit...I'm definitely feeling the certs coming in faster, and it's putting that upgrade cycle at a better pace.  (If I don't upgrade at least one thing from a day of play, it feels like rather wasted time)","1372637144"

"Thetruthishere","t5_2sntx","It's strange that you should mention that. At the risk of TMI, there have been two (kind of embarrassing) things related to your question. The first is that on Tuesday I had a fair amount of anal pain. I didn't notice right away, until I got out of bed and sat down in a chair. I feel I should point out (as lovely as this is) that I've had a hemorrhoid a couple of times before, so I figure the pain was likely a delayed effect of a 9 hour car ride from the Sunday prior. It's much better than it was but things were very swollen and sore down there and for days it's felt like there were tiny wounds in relation to that area, a good deal of that pain is actually on the outside. There has also been a surprising amount of bleeding, though my stool is fine. Other than the overall soreness of my bum when sitting (which is pretty much gone now), this hasn't felt anything like the other times. Then again, I've never had to sit in a car for 9 hours either. I'm sorry for describing something so personal and unpleasant to you. I was going to tell you that I haven't had any pain, then realized that wasn't true, but I'm not sure if this is exactly the answer you were hoping to hear.    

The second thing I can add is that I woke up this morning to find a long bruise above my lady business and I have no idea how it could've happened. As far as I know, there hasn't been anything unusual since the day I wrote here, except that I've been so tired by the end of the day that I'm actually sleeping at night. That's not too odd though because sometimes my general sleeplessness catches up with me, I just can't remember the last time I've slept this many nights in a row (especially with what's happened). It doesn't hurt though at all. It's just big and dark purple-ish. There's also a few smaller ones on my thighs, a little bigger than the average pencil eraser. Those don't hurt either and they're a bit lighter than the ""main"" one. My bf was actually the one who pointed them out to me this morning when I was getting dressed. He seemed genuinely surprised and concerned as to what caused them. I was too, but now am more so since starting to reply to you. ","1372637148"

We've had our fights, I've ran away, told her the meanest things anyone can tell anyone, I've seen her overdose and at her lowest point with drugs, but she's always been my best friend. She's my mommy, and no matter WHAT she was strung out on at the time, she did her best to make sure me and my sister had a decent life. She sold wedding items to try and make money for Christmas. She didn't always succeed at things like this, and most of the time the drugs took over but she still tried. 

Eventually, the drugs got her. She passed away a few years ago, and I miss her. I miss her more than words can say, and so does the rest of my family. Even through all her worst times, we still loved her and cared about her. We were disappointed, pissed, upset anytime she got really bad or ended up in jail again, but she was still our mom, wife, daughter, sister, whatever. 

She can't hurt herself anymore though. I'm glad for that at least. ","1372637155"

Existence does NOT make sense in ANY way, based on what we know. Even based on what we don't know, there's still seemingly no explanation.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","He is talking about people of CaineFaraday's political orientation, not his race. For instance, elsewhere in the thread he says that the British 'are without doubt one of the greatest races in history in terms of intelligence', and that an Englishman is 'superior on average' compared to a Hungarian. He said this about Germans (on /r/europe today):

&gt; The German character is geared towards hard work and efficiency. They are like machines that cannot be stopped. They can be useful to the world if this character is reined in but when left to its own devices there is no telling what horrors they can inflict on the world. I believe it is fundamentally part of the German character to sway towards Fascism.

In another thread on /r/unitedkingdom today, he expresses support for the EDL, who are a group of far-right hooligans. He has also previously been temporarily banned from r/unitedkingdom for posting BNP slogans.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't really fall into this category, but I can speak as someone who *started* to put on a lot of weight when i was in primary school / early high school (and then quickly got rid of it before I graduated). During those few years, I was quite overweight for my age.

In my case, there was no denial. I don't think most fat people *are* in denial. I knew I was fat. I knew it was unhealthy. I knew it was disgusting.

But food was a comfort. In my case, I was slowly realising that I was gay, while growing up in a deeply religious household that condemned it. This is the stuff of nightmares, people: believing that *who you are* is a product of Satan himself. It's a  dramatic example, but it demonstrates a point. The only thing that ever made me feel good was food, because it gave me that instant hit of sugar, or spice (or whatever it was I was craving). It was an immediate gratification mechanism during a time when I hated myself, and believed everyone else hated me, too. A dougnut tasted *just* as delicious whether I was happy or sad. Food is usually dependable and abundant, which is more than you can say about humans.

Fortunately, I snapped out of my rut, and - as soon as I did - I was able to tackle my weight issue. But I can see why many don't. There's not a single person on this planet who doesn't have a vice of some sort, depending on their level of anxiety. For some people, it just happens to be food, and it's a particularly *noticeable* trait. But if you already think people are disgusted by you, why would you care? Why *wouldn't* you eat a delicious hamburger if it's going to make you feel better... at least for a few minutes? Why starve yourself and try to impress a group of people who are going to hate you anyway?","1372637171"

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","I somewhat agree, but just to play devil's advocate, you are a participant in the global economy every day. There are very few jobs that aren't continually in danger of being outsourced, or don't have wage/benefit pressure from being outsourced or bringing in low-price immigrants on visas. There's little reason not to take personal advantage of the lower prices (or higher quality for the same price) offered by the work done overseas, if you're not part of a more organized campaign to force companies to stay in the US. You're paying more out of your pocket, and not remotely accomplishing what you set out to do.

Plus, as horrifying as the low-wage jobs are overseas, it IS a massive boon to their situation and their economy and helps them do what we did 100 years ago; start forming a middle class. You don't hate foreigners' kids . . . do you?","1372637174"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Once again we're struck with the many, many meanings of the word 'liberal'. No classic economic liberal would make the state his god, far from it, and if they're into Hayek they probably want to minimise the state as much as they possibly can. 

Judging by this person's belief in 'the marketplace' as something that would naturally reward 'the wise or the beautiful or the genius', and their opposition to what they call leveling (I'm going to assume they mean affirmative action and welfare) they are, in fact, an extreme economic liberal themselves.  

To an extent they recognise the ambiguities of the word liberal - 

&gt; For those of you who do not know, especially young people, I am compelled to inform you of the generally un-known truth that the word ""Liberal"" has a proud heritage and was originally a word that described men who were the political opposites of modern ""Liberals.""

&gt; The word ""Liberal"" was forcibly stolen and corrupted by evil men who intentionally perverted the use and meaning of the word ...

... but they themselves are involved in this very essay in twisting the meaning to the point where it's simply vague and confusing. ","1372637175"

At 29 (30 in October), Fred is not trying to forge out a career. He already has one. He's not going to move to Europe to find his place in football history. He has already found his place.

His place is in Brazil. He seems extremely happy there, and I wish him the best of luck.

Study for 40 minutes, game for 20, or if you cant just game for 20 then set a goal, don't allow yourself game time until you meet that goal.  Not only will you do great in college and life, but that gaming time will be all the more satisfying.","1372637184"

"skyrim","t5_2s837","1.) Get set in a class, get the Alchemist Shack, and DO NOT SELL UNIQUE ITEMS!. I sold a few dragon masks for a quick septim, and I regret it to this day. Made a new account. Also, don't kill the dark brotherhood. Wish I didn't, because I couldn't play those quests on my main character.

2.) The night sky in the Rift and the Pale is beautiful! Especially from the College of Winterhold. When you get to Sovngarde (will not spoil it for you), you'll love it!

3.) Find the Alchemist Shack! It's a great starter place. It has an enchanting table, alchemist table, and storage containers. It doesn't respawn, so you can store everything in it. Another good tip is to get a bit into the side quests before doing the storyline quests. You'll be better off that way. 

Oh yeah, and when the game gets easy, adjust the difficulty. I got bored when my Nord Heavy Armor wearing Sneak Archer was killing enemies with one shot. I'm currently playing on Legendary, and it's kicking my ass big time! And another thing to do to keep the game interesting is to work on secondary skills. I'm an Archer, with all Archery perks and all the Sneak perks, but little for one-handed (daggers). So I've been using daggers more than bows.

One more thing, GET THE DLC! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!","1372637186"

If they had ignored MR, jayce E and zac would of shredded their hp stacking ryze/thresh.  Ryze's build has high armor and hp/effective hp but has almost no magic resist, as did thresh's build.  The MR greatly reduces the effectiveness of zac's build especially, as he had 35 mpen + whatever his runes/masteries has.

From what the court said, she was born in the business of dog breeding/fighting. She started off as a fighter but was supposedly not tough enough (and if you owned her, you could understand why). She got her ears clipped as you can see and the worst part was that they were just done with scissors. She was then put into breeding because she looked so pretty and ended up having around 11-12 litters. Apparently she was ""all used up"" so (thankfully) instead of killing her, she was brought to the side of the road were her and her owner were caught before he could get away and a few weeks later she was brought into my sisters work. Unfortunately shes going away with my sister as she is moving out so i wont be able to play with her, shes a silly little girl and hasn't really ever been mistaken for smart, but we still lover her all the same.  

EDIT: i will post more pictures of her if you guys want, my sister has plenty considering she is a photography major.

""Lie"" entails falsity. Thus if, as you suggest, we evaluate ""this statement is a lie"" as true, the statement is a lie, meaning it is not true. Contradiction.

However, ""Lie"" also entails some degree of intent. If we evaluate ""this statement is a lie"" as false, it could be false for a couple different reasons.  The statement might actually be true, resulting in contradiction. But the statement could also be false and simply lack intentionality, thereby avoiding the contradiction.

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Well, there are a number of different entropies I can think of off the top of my head that all have applications in physics, and are all different.  The one you are most likely familiar with is the [Gibbs entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_entropy), which is additive.  However, entropy need not be additive for all systems.  For such systems, the [Tsallis entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsallis_entropy) has started to see use recently in a variety of physical systems as sort of a generalization of the Gibbs entropy.  A different generalization of the Gibbs entropy is the [Renyi entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9nyi_entropy), which has also been used to describe physically interesting systems (like the XY model, for example), but it is different from either the Gibbs or Tsallis entropy.  Yet another completely different entropy is the [relative entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) which has applications in quantum information and is a different beast entirely.  All of these are different from the classic [thermodynamic entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(classical_thermodynamics)) which is defined as a state function.  


There a quite a few others, and I haven't even really discussed any of the notions of entropy outside of thermodynamic equilibrium, where most of the above definitions don't necessarily work.  The issue of entropy is actually far more subtle and complicated than it is usually presented in equilibrium stat mech classes, and I hope you can see that now.


As an aside, I sure hope you don't take the same attitude in discussions offline that you do here.  Regardless of your level of education in physics, you do not know everything, and your colleagues will not appreciate an attitude like this, even if you do know what you are talking about.

- took responsability for the true nature of his actions
- had a conflicted but natural lovelife - easy girl first when inexperienced then the one you wanna marry - respected them both
- got revelations about his origins and accepted his legacy
- became aware of his skillset and their purpose in the conflict of things
- is politically involved and active
- grew into experienced character well aware of the subtleties, that eluded him in the past, of handling the new guy (Setsuna F. Seiei)
- has a solid bromance with former friend turned enemy turned friend which evolves into a threesome bromance
- has hot sister attracted to him which he doesn't wanna bang 

of course that's just how i remember him.. but i don't recall him being ""flat"" like kirito from SAO (who was meant to be boring as deep characters weren't the theme of that show).

But one night, back in my 2nd year University, some friends and I were leaving the local gay bar. Two guys of a couple, a guy who had a BF, and two single guys: myself and let's say Frank.

At the intersection where we'd all head to our respective homes, we stopped to talk for a bit longer. At some point, Frank started complaining that there was no-one around to hook up with.

Jokingly, I said, ""well, I was there all night....""

So we went to Frank's place and had fun. A quite good amount of fun, actually, not a 5 minute we're-both-desperate quickie or anything.

So I was quite surprised to find that the other 3 guys were still on the corner talking when I finally went back to my apartment. Their sole comment was, ""So you weren't joking after all?""

It's not supposed to be the Walk of Shame at 3 in the morning, that's technically still part of the night out. The sun is supposed to come up first....

Ultimately, roughly 80%-85% of the current population of Qatar are foreign nationals. A vast, vast majority of these foreign nationals are unskilled laborers from Asia and other Arab countries.

However, I think I can address your paragraph about ""as long as they consent, it's okay.""  You're right, gender norms etc influence the way we look at things.  We know there are people who participate in certain sex acts because they feel pressured to do it rather than because they want to.

The thing is at some point we have to trust people to make their own decisions.  I think shaming someone for enjoying something is just as bad as shaming them for not enjoying something.  I don't get to choose what I like.  I don't get to choose who or what I am attracted to.

Basically I think you are correct that BDSM can be challenged, but then you're makeup addiction has to be challenge in the same way to the same extent.  People who do BDSM can be beaten, bruised, coerced, and raped, but so can people who do vanilla sex.

I think I should note that if you want to discuss how BDSM is portrayed in porn (or any sex for that matter) that is a different matter.","1372637208"

Somebody mentioned the point of having balance issues with multi-target abilities, but it's really not that hard to cut the life steal % down to fractions of the original effect per target. It could also only apply on basic hits instead of spells (though the distinction would definitely need to be clearer when they implement). 

I just don't think its fair to look at the instances where life steal has ""failed"" (because even that is debatable) instead of where it has been successful. I don't even think Diablo 3 was that bad. You can get it on Mighty Belts and weapons and that's it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah I was going to bring that up, but....  Well, here's what happened to me.

I was an avid smoker for several years at this point.  I lost my usual hookup(he started a family), and had to go through a friend.  So we both go over to his buddies place, smoke up for a couple hours playing Fusion Frenzy.  On the way to drop my friend off back at his place, I get pulled over(that middle tail light in the back windshield was out, it was about 11pm).  I knew I was fucked right out of the gate.  I really don't remember much about the encounter, other than doing the breathalyzer and the cop let my friend go without any charges.  Initially I was charged with possession and driving under the influence of drugs.  Went to jail, luckily my parents bailed me out that night.  I got a decent lawyer and got the charges knocked down to Impaired Driving.  I did 6 months of probation(had to piss test twice a month for 4 months, had to pee in front of a stranger, and I have...issues where that's concerned, it was really uncomfortable for me), 15 sessions of group counseling($40 per session), plus court costs(around $2k).  Due to that conviction, I am not allowed in Canada until 2021 without a special permit that can be almost impossible to get, which sucks when you need to drive from Detroit to Buffalo NY.

Really the worst part was, the friend with me has a wife and kid, and is not exactly living comfortably.  Until the cop told me he let my friend go without charges I was beating myself up, knowing he absolutely cannot afford that contact and that it was my fault(not properly maintaining my vehicle).

If it becomes legal on a federal level(nationwide), I'll probably get back into it.  I still hang out with friends that smoke, but they know my stance on it and don't push anything.  I'm not trying to scare you or anything, this is just what happened to me.  I didn't really take it seriously until I got pulled over.  I agree it should be legal, but until it is, I don't want the hassle.","1372637213"

If you think you've got it in you, my advice would be to take the officer route. Try to get involved in DTUS (Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme), who will sponsor you through university, so you can pick up a degree (and experience university) without paying the extortionate fees. Education's always a good idea and it'll give you something to fall back on in the civvy world if things don't work out; job security isn't what it used to be in the MoD at the moment.

DTUS feed into the RE, REME, RLC and Signals (at least for Army-sponsored students) and you'll also train with your local DTUS unit/squadron while you're at university, which will give you a bit of experience and stand you in good stead for Sandhurst. I'm not entirely sure how DTUS works as I went down the OTC route, but I'm pretty sure you classify as a Group A TASO (Teritorial Army Sponsored Officer) while you train/study, and you'll be paid for your training too.

I think AOSB (Army Officer Selection Board) might be the first step you need to take towards getting sponsored, but if you call up or visit a recruitment office they'll be able to give you more info. If you're looking for tips on AOSB check out the ARRSE forum, there's plenty of people in a similar situation to yourself on there who're more clued up than I am and can offer more specific advice.

Hope that helps, and best of luck!","1372637219"

It's not a matter of whether you think the developer/publisher ""deserves"" your money. They put the effort into making the game. They do deserve it if you want to play it. *Of course* it could be better on PC; that's why we're all here. But using the ceiling of quality that consoles impose as an excuse to steal from people who are only doing their jobs is petty and juvenile. You don't want to ""encourage that kind of behavior""? You don't want to ""have to punish yourself""? It's not a fucking right. The publishers know where their market is; it's their *job*.

No you didn't. If you don't know Real Analysis, you haven't proven shit wrong.

You're making the claim that you can learn everything without education. The way burden of proof works is that the burden is on you to prove your claim.

&gt; You just assume that because I didn't pay for what I do know which hasn't been revealed to you except through your assumptions.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","&gt; rather on how buggy it is 

I've not encountered any bugs myself, so could you please elaborate?

&gt; All that on top of achievements that do not encourage teamwork but rather screwing your party over to try to get them.

Frizz's achievement is related to personal skill and is independent of your party (i.e. you don't need to mess with them to get it). Saluting Horrick can be done after the fight. The ""hard mode"" to complete Mai Tirin and Horrick in less than 15 minutes absolutely requires teamwork.

So... which one screws your party over?

&gt; Then Mai's pretty much non-existent tell that is the same as all her abilities on the unblockable shadow port. So you either bring a guardian that has lady luck sitting on their shoulder or enjoy any ranged class getting owned in seconds because a dodge roll is useless. Which forces classes into a near but not quite melee fight.

I don't understand why you're having trouble with Mai's tells, especially with one of your ""years of raid experience"". Yes, her character model is small compared to Lupi, which probably contributed to your failure to observe her moves, but otherwise I find her perfectly fine. Yes, her teleport nuke cannot be Evaded (as far as I've tried), but it is still treated as a projectile attack and can be Reflected and Blocked with anything ranging from Shield of Absorption to Toss Elixir U. 

Otherwise, the rest of the fight doesn't really have many things to look out for. Horrick's big red circles are obvious; hell, they even made the projectile sounds distinct so you know which one's coming even if you lost count. Mai's melee damage is only dangerous due to the Bleed stacks and Cripple. Her teleport nuke hurts a bunch, but she doesn't often chase very far afterwards, meaning you can dodge away and heal up.

&gt; Did the 15 minute bit twice now first try with stop watch going with ample time to spare and it bugged out with no credit.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Contact your school administrators and make an appointment.  I bet that you could talk them into letting you continue and complete your degree while starting to work or go to community college.  Or maybe you can find out what you need to do to graduate, even with the stress you have. Most schools have an alternative track, allowing students to take classes in a trade (like welding) while still graduating.  Even if it isn't published... you may be able to get permission to do this. 

A high school diploma is worth far, far more than a GED. Plus, the GED test is changing and is going to be far harder than it was before. If your grades have suffered up until now, I suspect you may have a hard time passing the tests while you are also working 60 hours a week. You won't be able to support yourself on a minimum wage job for 40 hours a week (housing, transportation, utilities, food and school cost big $). Trust me when I say that 8 classes would feel like a breeze compared to working this much and then having to do school work on top of it. 

I would not step out the door of your mom's home or quit school unless you have saved enough for 6 months of expenses and your first months tuition. You may be aching for freedom from the depression and anxiety, but that will not go away when the only thing standing between you and homelessness is a medical bill you can't pay, or a broken car, or a lost job.

Once you relax your outer sphincter and you've gotten a toy or something inside you, once you advance it a certain ways it will be trying to push through your internal sphincter.

Strengthening the rehabilitation aspect of prison is a good idea. Some people are beyond rehabilitation, their corruption fabricated into their very bio-chemistry, but others aren't, and we should strive for all whilst we can't make certain identification of which is which.

But there are other ways man, video games are just plain fun. What are we talking exactly, educational video games like little kids play, or just video games in general (Call of Duty, GTA, FIFA, Assassin's Creed)?

I would agree to the former, but the latter is just ridiculous in my mind. Letting inmates play Call of Duty to pass the time, time that could be spent strengthening the mind in a more complete way by reading, or physical exercise or just plain talking to people about their feelings.

Video games are for fun, and if you're argument is that they can be just as beneficial as books... why not leave it at books? Why give more when the tasks books, physical exercise, and psychological discussion cover all the bases that you think video games could cover as well? ","1372637248"

It was bad writing on my part.

Creating a society where there is theoretically no ranking is easy enough, but one where there is actually no ranking is very difficult.  

As a capitalist example, when you have performance ranking in businesses like Google or Microsoft, the person(s) who make the real decisions on the rankings (who may not be the ones who actually pen the decision - they may be the ones who inform them) hold tremendous actual power even if they hold no official power.  

In a communist society, the risk would lie with those who decide, ""who is an enemy of the state?""  

Historically, we've seen ""I want Bob's farm, or to force his daughter to marry me, or Bob pissed me off when he didn't support my idea yesterday, so Bob is an enemy of the state and his works contain capitalist leanings.""  

(My examples may be badly chosen but the key is that people are usually motivated by petty concerns and not by real justice.)  

A key concern, therefore, would be the abuse of the enforcement mechanism, quite possibly even to the point where real threats to the new society are ignored in favor of personal use of the system.  (Same as one of the primary risks with our current national surveillance scheme.)  

Another concern is that having the right to suppress oppressive thought will lead to groupthink and the inability for others to critically challenge those who hold the real power.  In my experience, even the best of persons or groups becomes harmful when they do not have significant checks on their power, because of the way human nature can make us blind to our own failings and the weaknesses of our beliefs.  

So, in final, I do not know any way to solve these concerns, but I believe an ideologically free society is by nature anti-fragile to them (will naturally come to a ""better"" resting point rather than always moving toward increased corruption), bringing benefits well-worth the loss of tolerating such thought.  

Even if I'm wrong on this, I still believe the two concerns are most critical to the long-term success of said new society.

"fantasywriters","t5_2t4ad","Other things were [the fact that Durzo was Acaelus Thorne and was immortal and such, a story which you only hear about once at the beginning of the story and is given almost no significance.  The Rat thing enraged me.  Had I not been reading it on my computer I would've tossed the book across the room.  Somehow Kylar was able to bond Durzo's kakari EVEN THOUGH he very explicitly says that you can't bond a kakari once it's been bonded to someone else so you have to kill them to use it, and this is a rule which is used as implicit explanation for other plot points.  Voiding that rule made everything else seem completely forced.  The ""ironic"" fact that Durzo and Momma K loved each other which was pitched like a twist but was so painfully obvious that it was like said ""hey, did you know the sky is blue?  MIND BLOWING, RIGHT?""  Especially since it was much more likely that he just fell in love with her after Vonda died.  There are so many things wrong with the fact that Rat wasn't actually dead that I have to wonder if the writer ever actually read through his own work.  Not to mention the fact that you revel in this face for literally like 2 pages before he dies and it becomes insignificant.  And then, of course, Kylar kills Durzo, which wasn't really a twist but had to be done.  I thought that part was done fairly well, actually.](/spoiler)

The problem is that the author makes the reader unaware or unsuspecting of twists by blatantly stating lies to them from the narrator's voice.  For good twists, you have to insert vagueness in descriptions, use the characters' actual confusion or lack of truth to, or misdirect the reader with clues that can be interpreted in many ways.  Lying to the reader and not giving them any clues to work with is not the way.  

As for ME3, I'm in the small small percent who was very pleased with the ending (the green ending), except for the obvious absence of closure which they only sort of fixed with the redo.  I think the fact that it brought up so much debate was something good seeing as how the game is supposed to be the experience that each individual player chooses and interprets.  I do think, however, that the difficulty in the execution was that they created an unbeatable enemy and then had to figure out a way to beat it...which is hard.  really hard.  Meh.","1372637272"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As a person that can be manipulative and has been considered manipulative before, I will tell you exactly what type of person I am like.

At the basis of my heart, I am a selfish person. I have no concern over the feelings of others unless I have already decided that I want them to feel a certain way. This is because of a simple fact: If this person is feeling a particular way, I am happier. This is the same across the board: friends, family, roommates, enemies, sometimes even down to acquaintances and coworkers. I want them to be feeling a particular way because it makes me happy to see them that way.

I'll take a very recent example to explain it in more detail. I have a close friend that I developed feelings towards, and my actions towards him changed because of that. I live near this friend and often go shopping with him, so what I would do, is if I saw him complaining about the price of something that I knew he really liked, I would pick it up and buy it for him. My justification in this is that his happiness (i.e. having what he wants) makes me happy because I want him to be happy. The manipulative part of me recognizes though that what I want from him is easier to obtain the more he likes me. It always comes back to my desire and my wants.

To explain this in a negative light, there was once a friend that called me out on being manipulative and tried to make others see how I was using them purely for my own happiness, something that I didn't want others to know at the time but that I now openly admit to my friends and potential partners. As you might expect, it redirected how I derived enjoyment from knowing here. Instead of wanting her happiness, like I do for most people that I personally know, I wanted her to be upset and to feel emotional pain. I did this by redirecting her statements against her, and she lost many friends and a romantic interest. I was ecstatic.

Then, there are most people. These are the everyday people I see on the streets that pass by me that I can't attach a name to. That guy that I pass every morning on the way to class, the girl that is a friend of a friend of a friend, coworkers that I don't have to interact with on a daily basis, the unnamed masses in a country that I have no personal attachment to. Their emotions don't affect me in any way, and as a result, I don't really care what happens to them. They could get cancer, and I wouldn't really feel an ounce of sadness. They could win the lottery, and I wouldn't feel an ounce of happiness. Their lives don't affect mine, and as a result I don't really give two shits about what happens to them.

Many people might wonder how this relates to manipulation of people. The answer to this is simple: every action I take, whether alone or with somebody else, is judged by how much pleasure it will give me. If I do something nice to somebody, it is because I like them and will feel enjoyment if they feel enjoyment. It also usually means I want something from them. It could be something as simple as companionship to a favor to sex. In the same way, every negative action I do towards a person is built around my pleasure. I'm upset with the person. I realized I can't get what I want from the person and am upset that I can't. The person has done something that I perceive as against my happiness. In all those cases, negative actions towards those people, destroying them or just inflicting minor emotional bruises, gives me pleasure.

In this way, even the nicest things I do for people are a sort of manipulation on my part, and I try to get exactly what I want.

Tl;dr I, a manipulative person, make choices based purely on my own desires, and the emotions of others are trivial to my purposes.","1372637273"

"MDMA","t5_2qwvg","SSRIs do their work over a coarse of time.  They induce chemical changes in your brain that your brain actually adapts to over the coarse of your treatment.  Obviously this is the reason that almost all mood altering medications aren't prescribed like antibotics-they need time to work.  This time is far longer than the 'half-life' or how long the meds actually stay in your system.  You can find the half-life and most interactions documented in Merck's or via wikipedia.  Those are obvious.  You SHOULD ask your doctor/presciber what their medical opinion is.  You (hopefully) have been open with them about your emotional and chemical state because they are prescribing you medication, so letting them know of your illegal drug use should already  have taken place or should during your coarse of treatment.  From this frank discussion with them, you will hopefully get a professional opinion and a friendly recommendation on how long and what effects MDMA will have with your medication.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Tyrion pulled Penny along by the hand with Mormont following behind them up the steps of the great pyramid. A hairy old man would attract no attention in Mereen, but the two dwarfs were already drawing the eyes of the gathering crowd. There was no doubt in his mind that they had already been found missing from the slave pens, but if they fought today, they would likely not live to see the sun set.

“All stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn, of House Targaryen, the Unburnt, Mother of Dragons, khaleesi of the Dothraki, Breaker of Chains, Queen of Mereen, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, the Rhoynar and the First Men.”

Tyrion stepped out into the open courtyard between the men muttering behind him and the teenage queen. She was just as beautiful as the rumors whispered she was. But as he stood watching her, all Tyrion could picture was Mormont fucking his silver-haired whore.

“Your Grace,” Tyrion said, bowing. She did not look angry, which was good.

But she did not speak. Instead a girl next to her, no older than eleven, addressed him. “All men must wait to speak to the king and queen.”

“It’s alright,” Daenerys Targaryan said. “Let him speak.”

Tyrion smiled. “Tyrion Lannister, of House Lannister, the Imp, the Half-Man, Killer of kin, and Lord of Casterly Rock.”

“I recognize your house,” said the queen. “But what is a Lannister doing in Essos?”

“Rarer than a dragon, I know.”

Daenerys studied him with those purple eyes.

“Ser Barristan?” she said.

A man clad in plate stepped forward and for the first time Tyrion saw the finest knight in Westeros standing before him in the golden courtroom. Tyrion smirked at Ser Barristan, whose stony expression betrayed no secrets.

“I knew Tyrion Lannister from our time together in King’s Landing, though we rarely talked personally,” the old knight said. “His face has changed, but this is the same man.”

“And what do you know of the Lannisters?”

“The Lannisters are a powerful house of Westeros. By far the wealthiest. His father, Lord Tywin, is the one who betrayed your father and sacked King’s Landing. It was Lannister men who murdered Rhaenys, Aegon and their mother in their beds. He is the fiercest military foe you will ever face.”

“Let’s hope you don’t face him anytime soon,” Tyrion said. “My father is no longer with us. My first gift to you.”

Daenerys continued to study him. “Continue, Ser Barristan.”

“His brother, Jaime Lannister, is a fine swordsman and member of the Kingsguard. He was also the one who murdered your father.”

*Unfortunately, all true,* Tyrion thought. *But let’s see if her father’s madness runs in her.* She turned from Ser Barristan and addressed him once more. “It seems your family poses a great risk to me, Lord Tyrion.”

“I am as much my father and my brother as you are yours.”

“What is it you want?”

“To serve you. To advise you. To help you seize the Iron Throne and bring stability to Westeros.” *And to fuck my sister more than Jaime ever could.*

She did not even blink; perhaps she received a dozen men a day promising her the same thing. “You have given me no reason to trust you.”

“I came to you freely and unarmed, didn’t I?”

“I may be young, but I know the strength of words and minds.” *Very wise, my Lady. Already you are a better ruler than Joffrey.*

Ser Barristan stiffened next to her. “Your Grace, I believe it unwise to trust this man,” he said. “Though in King’s Landing he was known for his wit, he was also known to spend his days with women and his nights with wine.”

Tyrion couldn’t help but grin at that. “I’m not asking to share your bed or your wine,” he said. “A curious guard, your Grace, considering he used to fight for your father and served the man who murdered your brother.”

He almost thought he saw her smile. “Ser Barristan has proved his loyalty. You have not.”

“So we’re negotiating.”

She smiled at that. “Lord Tyrion, you have brought me nothing but yourself.”

“The most valuable asset you can have.”

“A bold claim. What else can you offer me?”

Tyrion’s thoughts moved to his next move. He needed steel, and he would have it if he played things right. Although he had not yet sealed the deal with Brown Ben Plumm, now was not the time to get caught up on technicalities.

“I have the Second Sons.”

“I *had* the Second Sons,” she said. “They abandoned me just as they will abandon you.”

“I have promised them gold, a powerful promise I’ve found.”

“You have promised them promises.”

“The same promise I bring you,” he said. “Let me serve you, and you will have all of the gold of Casterly Rock behind you.”

Mormont stirred behind him. “Your Grace,” he said. “This man is an exile. He did not come here willingly, but fled with his tail between his legs. I found him hiding in Volantis. He comes to you only because you are his last chance. He would be more useful as a hostage and even more useful with his mouth bound.”

*So this is what I get for saving your life,* Tyrion thought. *It was unwise to bring you to your Jonquil.*

Daenerys did not even look at the hairy knight. But her smile was now gone.

“Ser Jorah is right to call me an exile,” said Tyrion, “And he is no doubt the most experienced among us in that regard. However, it is not fear that fuels me, but fire. The same fire that burns in you. A burning desire for home, for revenge.”

Tyrion thought he almost saw something stir in the girl’s eyes. But she only stared at him. “I admire your strength, Lord Tyrion,” she said. “But it seems that all you have brought me is a company who turned their back on me and the man who betrayed my trust.”

Unsullied were moving around the sides of the courtroom, and he wondered if he had missed a silent command from Ser Barristan. He felt his heart quicken its beat, but he could show no unease. “Illyrio Mopatis himself sent me to you.”

“And why would he do that?”

“Dragons.”

“What?” She leaned forward on her throne as if she had misheard him, her eyes wide and curious.

Tyrion was addressing the court as much as her now. “I have studied them since my childhood,” he said. “I have seen the skulls of your dragons’ ancestors, read rare books on their nature and history. I may not know what it’s like to feed them or watch them fly but I have more than a scrap of information for you, which may be useful considering your… setbacks.”

“Such as?”

“Dragons cannot grow if they are contained. If you want a household pet, get a cat.” The men behind him were murmuring again. *Let them squabble.*

“I am well aware of those constraints,” she said. “But for now they are safe.”

“Are you also aware that dragons are neither male nor female?”

Daenerys smiled. “Yes, Lord Tyrion. I have spent more than a few minutes with my children.”

“My Queen is more astute than my late nephew ever was. Has she also noticed that her children can be called with three sharp whistles, each longer than the one before it?”

“I have called them this way before. Perhaps my lord should leave their care to me. I may know little of wars, but my children are my blood. I know them well.” She sat back on her throne, still smiling.

“Curious, considering that last piece of information is a child of my own creation. Dragons are not so easily summoned.”

She did not blink. “They answer to me.”

“Then perhaps our queen would be gracious enough to give us a demonstration. There are terrible rumors that the largest of your three is loose above the skies. And there’s nothing I love more than silencing the rumors of weaker men.” The courtroom went still and silent. He smiled.

And Daenerys Stormborn stood up. At once his smiled disappeared and he became even more aware of Unsullied and men in bronze masks shifting along the walls around him. 

Her voice was louder now, her face hard. “My people suffer,” she said. “My men are dying. My city crumbles as thousands of soldiers move in to kill me. And you waste my time with jokes. You came claiming to want to advise me, yet all I have seen is an application to be my jester. I have had enough of this for one day.”

Her men were moving closer now; he heard the shuffling of feet as the crowd moved away from him. Tyrion felt fear, but he would not be imprisoned again.

“You are not the last Targaryan,” he said. The courtroom froze.

“What do you mean?” 

“There is another. Your nephew survived the fall of King’s Landing.”

“I will not tolerate lies in my own court.”

“I met the boy,” said Tyrion. “Have you heard the rumors of the Golden Company’s newest contract? How they’ve hurriedly sailed across the Narrow Sea to Westeros, how they’ve already launched attacks on the shore, taken castles, and raised their banners behind a mysterious figure?”

She stared at him. “Rumors are not facts.”

Tyrion could not help but laugh. “In Westeros you are nothing but rumors,” he said. “You survived the Dothraki sea. You burned the warlocks of Qarth. You sacked Astapor and Yunkai and freed their slaves. You conquered Mereen. And from here to the Wall men whisper of your three dragons, growing stronger by the day.” He waved his hand at the crowd behind him, at the Western kingdom beyond the pyramids.

“Do not believe the rumors if you wish, but as we speak, even before I set foot in Mereen, another Targaryan has taken your element of surprise. He has already raised an army and has already begun his war in Westeros. While you have sat on this golden throne your real throne, the Iron Throne, is being taken by another.”
His smile faded. “Your people are suffering. Your men are dying. Your city crumbles as thousands of soldiers move in to kill you. And you waste your time playing court. Aegon lives.”

There were no whispers, no padding of feet. Even the wind had ceased. Every eye in the room was upon Daenerys, except for the purple set locked on Tyrion. His heart was pounding in his chest, but he did not drop his gaze.

“Send the rest away,” she said. “Bring him to my chamber. We have much to discuss.”

You make your way to the concert throughout the stage, all the while Goofy and Max work through their issues with eachother, and Sora and Donald taking a back seat in this level, possibly being separated from the other two in the process. 

The climatic ending battle would take place on stage as Powerline himself is being consumed with Darkness, yet still singing Eye to Eye during the battle (Max lip-synced in the movie so the song would still be playing). Couple quick-time events during the fight. You get to control Max during the fight to save Goofy, as a throw back to the last fight in KHII, showing his father that he really does care about him.

i would have to answer your question with a question and ask WHAT drugs became legal, how are they being distributed, manufacturing, ect.  ?

you have to understand that there is still a black market for legal drugs as well, you look at places like in missouri or arkansas where legal drugs can actually be traded with more volume and higher return on investment based on ease of access and legality.

some alternatives if you were to rule out ALL drugs would be pretty much anything thats would be in demand historically, human trafficking, arms dealing, kidnapping, counterfeit currency, fraud in real estate. take your pick. personally i think you would see a high increase in identity theft, as it is a growing market currently.

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","There are several things to consider.  First and foremost is the placement of the centre of mass and the centre of lift.  Also the centre of thrust, but unless it's a long way out from the centre line through the CoM, it doesn't matter so much.  For stable flight, you want the CoL behind the CoM, although not TOO far.  Too far and it's all going to go tits up, but not far enough and it'll be flighty.  Experiment to find the ideal distance.  Next, bear in mind fuel tank placement and how they'll drain - if you have, say, tanks then empty fuselage then more tanks, your CoM may be in the middle when they're full, but the front tanks will empty first, and the CoM will shift backwards.  If it shifts to or behind the CoL, chances are you're going to end up in an uncontrollable spin as the plane tries to rearrange itself to put the two centres back the way it wants them.  Sadly this means flying backwards, and you're probably not geared up for that.  Unfortunately there's no way to check the empty mass of the tanks when building, so you'll just have to eyeball it.

Control surfaces, in my experience, automatically work out which way up they are.  Try not to fiddle too much when placing them, but I find turning on angle snap, then rotating them 90 degrees one way or the other sits them neatly on the wing, right in the centre of them.  You can slide them along the wing edge to where you want them, but not up/down (or left/right if it's a tail fin).  Remember that surfaces placed ahead of the CoM will turn the opposite way to ones places behind it - which makes sense, you're trying to apply a force in the opposite direction to produce the same rotation.

I also find (not sure if this is just me, or if it's a known glitch with the game) that my planes, regardless of how well I build them, are ""stuck"" to the runway all the way to the end, but will lift off instantly once they come off the end.  I've had planes that will lift off at 50m/s that refuse point blank to nose up until they're off the runway at over 100.  If I then land again and take off, they behave normally.  Also regarding wheels - the nearer your rear set are to the centre of mass, the easier it will be to nose up, but if they're too near you'll tip over backwards when you touch down empty (CoM shifts past them).  For the nose, make sure you turn symmetry down to one, or you'll end up with two wheels in the same place, which plays havok with steering in a straight line.

Given your brief description, I think the most likely culprit is the placing of your CoM and CoL.  I'd wager you've got one on top of the other?  I made that mistake early on myself, and couldn't work out why all my planes spun out as soon as they were off the ground.  Give it a try.","1372637301"

That stack at the beginning is 7 books and roughly 500pages that I've filled out of my own freetime. 

I'm a freshmen in college atm and jumped into the pre-animation major because it sounded like something fun that I wouldn't regret taking while I figured myself out I found what I would be able to actually do with my life. After a little bit of encouragement my interest exploded from something I had loosely wanted to always do into something I want to do for the rest of my life and have a legitimate chance at getting into one of the best animation programs in the country with the rate I'm going.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Trans individuals are one of the most horribly oppressed minority groups historically and currently. Reading the responses of people attempting to dictate how trans people should act and present themselves when it is painfully obvious that these same people have absolutely no understanding of trans people or their experiences is particularly annoying.

Trans people are often physically assaulted simply for trying to use the bathroom, using public transportation, or just existing. In this very thread someone states that if a post operational transperson revealed to them their status after having sex with them they would physically assault them and that they would be morally justified in doing so.

An overwhelming majority of transpeople are simply trying to live their life with some semblance of normalcy. They are not attempting to ""trick"" anyone into having sex with them as many of the other posts in this thread are insinuating. In the same sense, not disclosing their previous surgeries to their potential sex partner is not the same thing as stating that they are cisgendered.

With all of this in mind, as an individual I believe that a transperson does not owe their potential one night stand their medical history unless they are carrying an STI. In a relationship however I do believe that they should inform their partner because being trans is a big part of the way someone's life plays out and withholding it from someone you're intending to be intimate with on an emotional level is distant.

Whether or not a trans individual has to disclose anything at all to their potential partner should not in anyway shape or form be legislated of all things which someone in this thread actually suggested.

If you can tell whether or not someone is trans then you already know and if you can't tell then it shouldn't matter to you. If you didn't know until they told you the next day why does it matter? Did you literally feel the Y chromosome or the extra X? 

If this is honestly such a big problem and fear for someone then they should disclose this phobia to their partner and ask them straight up if they are cisgendered.","1372637314"

Eventually she'll go to someone -- maybe Angel, maybe Quinn -- and confess about Dexter being the BHB. She'll end up regretting that decision and killing herself over it.

Dex will be exposed as the BHB near the very end of the season. He'll get arrested and there will be some very tense scenes with Batista, Quinn and Masuka. Somehow, he'll escape from custody. Maybe Deb will help him out of guilt, maybe Vogel will help him, maybe he'll just find a way to escape on his own.

There will be a manhunt for Dexter, but the Brain Surgeon will have made things personal by that point and Dex won't be able to flee Miami before he kills the Brain Surgeon. So we have Dex on the run for the last episode, maybe last two.

He'll kill the Brain Surgeon, but the cops will find him. There will be a standoff. Someone will tell Dex that Deb killed herself earlier. Or maybe Deb even shows up at the stand off, confesses about LaGuerta, and then shoots herself.

Dex will be overcome with grief. He'll charge the cops, and Angel and Quinn will have to gun him down.","1372637319"

Just putting contraceptives out there doesn't solve the problem. You have to actually convince kids to use them. And we have to teach the same thing again and again to every single generation because virtually no human knowledge is inherited through birth.

The main problem is the content. PvE is designed to be facerollingly easy so GW2's target audience of casual and new gamers can pick up the basics and still feel like they've accomplished something. For experienced gamers, this means most of them blow through all the content like they are playing a giant tutorial level of LoL. 

The combat only shines in small PvP skirmishes like off-hour WvW on dead servers or team matches once upon a time. It's a shame really, GW2's combat would fit really well in terms of complexity and responsiveness between LoL and DOTA.

Anyway, Donald Judd's daughter was trying to bring in hip kids from the college towns around the state, so she booked a few bands to play at night. She booked a band, and put them up at the Judd house. They played that night, after Donald Judd had gone to bed.  He could hear the band playing from all the way on the other side of Marfa. Enraged, he drove over to the concert and kicked over the amps and possibly broke some gear (He didn't want to give that sort of reckless late night partying impression to the town folk of Marfa).  Anyway, the band ended up staying much later that night at the Judd house (I guess they didn't really have anywhere else to go).  According to the story, a rolex watch was missing the next morning along with the band (probably stolen to pay for some of the broken gear maybe?).

The old lady recalling this story was asked who this band was.  She scratched her head and said they had a really funny name, but couldn't remember it at the time. 

A few days later she said ""I don't remember the band's name, but that year they got really famous with a record called something like 'Melancholy and Infinity Sadness' (sic).

Of course I am probably butchering this story, but I found it entertaining at least.","1372637325"

My intention was to demonstrate that theism and atheism had commonly understood meanings (and atheism can actually mean one or the other: some atheists *believe* that no God or gods exist, others reject the claim that God or gods exists.) 

It's not that changing the definition of the word makes the opposite something else; it's that theism and atheism relate to the subject of belief, which is separate from the subject of knowledge. 

What's interesting about this is that atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive terms. Many atheists will readily admit that they cannot know whether or not a God or any gods exist, but rather they reject all claims that God exists *as well as* the claim that God does not exist.

&gt; In 1968, the fury and violence of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago propelled us toward a tipping point in politics. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated, America suffered its bloodiest year in Vietnam and drugs seduced us. Yet idealism--and hope--flourished. Explore the significance of that turbulent year and the way it continues to affect the American landscape. Tom Brokaw offers his perspective on the era and shares the rich personal odysseys of some of the people who lived through that chaotic time, along with the stories of younger people now experiencing its aftershocks. Includes archival footage and interviews with former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who was talking to King when he was assassinated and rushed to his side to try to staunch the wound; Olympic gold medalist Rafer Johnson, who wrestled RFKs' assassin to the ground; and Arlo Guthrie, best known for his song ""Alice's Restaurant.

&gt; The algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop must equal zero

Now assume a simplistic model with the transistor turned ON. I am looking at the loop from +5V input, through base to emitter, to ground and seeing that the voltage across the load must be 5V. Then I am looking at the loop from +9V (Vcc?), through collector to emitter, and seeing that the voltage across the load must be 9V.

The voltage drop just across the load can't be two different things so clearly I'm missing something key here. Does this rule not apply here or is the transistor doing something complex I've missed?

This is a picture of myself during Christmas (somewhere in the mid-late 90s). I was so psyched about the Nintendo 64 coming out after I had received a VHS tape in the mail that advertised games for the system (Two ads that stuck out in my mind was the one for Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64. It might have shown a flash of Conker's Bad Fur Day, not sure). As a kid I grew up playing NES with my Pop-pop ALL THE TIME, so the updated graphics looked incredible. Although, as excited as I was, I never expected to get a N64 because my mom was a single parent and was struggling financially. So after a while I kind of accepted the fact and settled on the promise that at least one of my friends would get one so I would still be able to play it eventually. This might have been the same year that the console came out. Anyway, my mom always had this tradition of small presents first then work your way up to the bigger ones. She handed me a small present and when I opened it it was a N64 rumble pack. My first reaction wasn't the one you're looking at. I actually got a tad upset, let down even. I remember looking at my mom saying, ""Ooh..thank you..but we don't even have a Nintendo 64."". Without saying anything she gave me a smirk and raised her eye brow. Then it hit me what was in the biggest box under the tree. Thus the biggest smile I ever smiled in a picture was born and I've been hooked on N64 ever since. To this day I regularly play Mario Kart 64 with my buddies and a few beers, and I have played the SHIT out of Super Mario 64.","1372637350"

You do realize that the only reason that Rengar is viable is because of a bug right?

If he can work w/o the triple Q fine, he doesn't 'need' a rework. If he only works because of a bug - he does.

Now you can argue that we should leave the bug in the game as it doesn't hurt anything, but it does. Triple Q is not something that people should have to know about in order to play the champion. Consistency is a very important factor in this game, and having something as inconsistent as the triple Q just to let a champion be viable is ridiculous.

Also, he'd still be walking a razor knife edge of just balanced and when the meta shifts he'll either drop out completely or be completely overpowered (and then nerfed). He'll still need a rework if Riot ever wants to touch him again.","1372637352"

Majority of the other employees are of some Hispanic descent and most speak only Spanish and broken English. I happen to also speak both languages along with damn near perfect French, and although I understand Spanish perfectly, I can't speak it as well.

One of my favorite payback times was when a girl thought I was hitting on her boyfriend so after I handed him the change she said in Spanish something along the lines of, ""why don't you keep your hands off my boyfriend, bitch? Do u see an open for business sign here?"" She rolled her eyes and started walking away. I proceeded to call back, ""Trust me, I don't want any part of something you have touched."" I then called her a whore in French. I felt sorry for her boyfriend but telling her off felt so good.

I get stuff like that a lot. People are so surprised when I speak English one minute and then speak Spanish to them the next. I just wish I had more opportunities to speak French.","1372637353"

Apologies were made and it was no big deal.

My dad gets home and his father tells him to get ready to meet a family who is interested to see if there is a match.

There's been research showing that you can only *really* comprehend things where you already know some ridiculously large percentage of the words. Otherwise you're stuck looking things up or asking.

Second, once you reach a certain level there's no way around fleshing out your vocab. There's just no substitute. Take someone who had 4 years of a language in school and compare their vocab to a 4 year old native speaker... Student loses.

Enter the terms into Anki or something. It's nice if you can figure out a way to put more focus on more common words that you encounter in real life through reading or discussion.

Didn't ruin short guys for me, heh! Height has never been a thing for which I have a preference but before I settled down with my current boyfriend there was definitely a little thing deep in my brain wondering if a short guy I was going on a first date with would say something that would make me feel like the Hulk all evening.

If you are talking about a single user client node, or anything that happens over the Internet, then it will not make the slightest bit of difference.

(Well, perhaps if the game in question has some utterly pathological networking code. I saw one game that fully opens and then closes a TCP connection - four roundtrips - for every message. So yes, if your game unnecessarily does 100+ TCP connections per second, then TCP offload will help.

John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.

John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.

The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".
John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.

""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said
""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.
""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.

John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.

John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.

John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.

Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.

When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.

Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.

The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.

John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.

""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.

By the way, the `-q` flag returns `0` if an error occurs, meaning a file that

We have alt nights, where we take out enemy zergs 1.5x or 2x of out zerg, playing our level 20s- 50s.

Your example is just raw numbers, which is pretty much what it is - numbers. 
WVW is about good commanders and smart play. Even a lowbie can significantly contribute to a zerg

A mobile alt can spy and inform his server via voice com about whereabouts of enemy zerg. That right there is 100x more contribution than your hypothetical  zerg of 20 with average HP of 20k, clashing agains another hypothetical zerg of equal force and  numbers

A lowbie mesmer  can port golems, use feedback. Thats a significant support

A lowbie guardian can drop reflection wall. A good placed reflection can do insane damage and take out a huge chunk of enemy zergs XP.

These are just few small examples of a support that ANY lowbie can contribute. You just need to start thinking NOT like a lowbie.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Hey man, just stumbled into this thread while searching for some other stuff. Have you made any progress?

One question I don't see answered here: What is your physique? How much do you weigh, what is your height, BF%, etc.?

I ask because if you currently weigh 400 lbs at 40% body fat, you're probably not going to see results anytime soon. You would need to lose 100-150 lbs of fat before you will notice any fitness gains, unless you're a linebacker in the NFL.

Also, are you running outside or on a treadmill?  Running outside has its advantages, but if you're just getting started you might want to start on a treadmill since it will ensure you run at an even pace. Start at 5.0mph and see how far you can go without stopping. When you get tired, walk at 3.0mph for 2 minutes then try again. The next time you run, try bumping it to 5.1mph and 3.1mph while meeting or exceeding the previous times.  Don't try running outdoors until you see at least 5-6 sessions with consistent improvement.

Hope this helps!","1372637368"

Once the police suspect you of a DUI they can arrest you, search your car , get you off the road.  It doesn't matter if you take the breathalyzer or not.  They can even ask for the field sobriety tests, build a case against you based on your driving patterns.

What the blood draws are doing, is to scare the DUI suspect.  And also, I guess for a more elaborate piece of evidence if the case goes to trial.  In DUI cases, they probably won't even go to trial anyway.

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","Hi! I actually go to Memorial University, not in public health though. So I can't speak to the program but I can clarify a bit about MUN/St. John's. 

*About MUN and university prestige:* 
Just keep in mind that where you want to work in the end should influence where you get your Master's degree. Gov't--it doesn't matter. Academia--it matters huge. MUN doesn't have the same international recognition as other universities, but like any university it has great, well respected programs.

*Why MUN is appealing:*
First, since it's the only university in NL the students and faculty at MUN get a lot of recognition on the island. You are definitely a bigger fish here than you would be elsewhere. Second, it will cost you less than $5,000 to get a MPH. That's a big pull. I don't have stats on the ""Canadian ivy league"" but it's not nearly that affordable. Third, NL is booming. The job market here for higher educated people is very promising. 

*St. John's -- the city*
Notice: I live in Corner Brook not St. Johns (nearly 700km away) but I've been to St. John's lots.
I moved to Newfoundland from Ontario, and yes  St. John's is not like Toronto, Montreal, or Vancouver. But it has everything you would want, just on a smaller scale. You won't get 1,000 great restaurants to choose from, but you'll find 50 restaurants that offer everything you want. Best fish and chips of my life. It has charm, character, and culture. You can see whales and icebergs while you're recovering from partying on George Street. You'll meet the nicest people. Canadians are nice, but Newfoundlanders are on a whole different level. No joke. St. John's does have a great city life, but it's different than other cities. You're more likely to hear Galway Girl than a top 40s song playing in a pub. Also, it's not that cold. One thing I will say is that like any city on the Atlantic, it rains and is foggy a lot. 

Grad school is what you make of it. If you have great friends in your program, good support from your supervisor, and interesting research you will be happy, the rest is just the background. 

Best of luck in making a decision! ","1372637370"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","It doesn't matter how small the inequality is, it's still just that, inequality! And social/intellectual ""hierarchies"" probably won't exist without some inequality of money (which would not exist in anarcho-communism) there would be no real reason for any social hierarchy to exist if everyone has the same resources. And as far as the intellectual front is concerned, all children will have access to the same source material and be taught the same things, sure some might get somewhat better than others, but that can be fixed through tutors and hard work and dedication to knowledge which I believe is an innate part of human nature (the will to learn, that is). 

Social hierarchy only exists (as far as we know) in capitalistic/feudalistic systems so there's not any evidence that one would exist outside of those systems (like anarcho-communism). I don't believe it would. It would hinge on who likes who's personality better and that's strictly opinion so I'm fairly sure there wouldn't be any actual structure. ","1372637371"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","And people wonder why they pace themselves in tournaments. Their best performance of the tournament came in the first game, and Brazil's came in the final. Reminds me of the Euro's, everyone was hyping about Russia after their first game while Spain struggled in their first game (same at World Cup 2010). Who won the tournament? It was Spain. They play a certain way so that they do enough to win games, but don't over exert themselves so that they end up being tired. Winning 4/5-0 and being entertaining is not the prime focus.

Brazil themselves this tournament were criticised in the group stages for losing control of games after strong starts, but it was enough for them to win.

It is even more relevant for Spain because of their reliance on Xavi, who simply cannot play at his highest level every 3 days for 90 minutes. This has also been one of the reasons Alonso plays in the side, when available. He is able to cover defensively, allows Xavi to do less running (albeit at the haste of Xavi playing 5/10 yards further forward than he'd like). Alonso is also perfect tactically (Del Bosque said none of Spain's success would be possible without Xavi, Iniesta, Casillas and Alonso) and has actually scored important goals (France), as well as providing some height and strength.

Brazil have developed really well this tournament, and have found their best 11. Paulinho is excellent in his role. Neymar is just brilliant, the quality of his 4 goals is quite incredible, against top opposition too. I still think Brazil need some more options at centre forward, and learn to close out games better to win the world cup but they have made great strides in this tournament.","1372637372"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;partly to make up for the healthcare costs of people doing the drugs

But mainly because demand is fairly price inelastic and high taxation is politically acceptable in a way that wouldn't be tolerated on goods like foodstuffs.

Any large scale gang involvement in the drugs trade following legalisation would be almost entirely because of bad government policy.  Anything beyond a normal sales tax is just stupid.","1372637375"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","There is obviously a limit to how far you can see and how far you can ID a threat/hazard.  In the scenario with an oncoming truck, passing it at 150mph without slowing down is much more dangerous than slowing down to 75mph, simply because you have much more time to react once you are close enough to discern that the driver is texting, swerving, not paying attention, etc.  

If you can discern that much at 150 yards (a generous distance) you will have 0.93 seconds to ID if he's a threat AND make your move, assuming he's doing 70mph.  If you're going 75mph, that time becomes 1.41 seconds, which is a half-second more time to act.  A half-second doesn't seem like much time, but in an emergency situation it can easily be the difference between swerving and avoiding the hazard and becoming a hood ornament.  This is obviously a scenario where it makes the least difference too, since we've got to combine speeds (oncoming traffic).  A horizontal or stationary hazard changes the #s to 2.73 seconds for the 75mph rider and 1.36 seconds for the 150mph rider - riding at 75mph gives you twice the time to act.

Combine the effects of speed on reaction time (as above) and on braking distance, which is *not* linear, and you have two very good reasons for riding at a slower speed, in terms of safety.  150mph gives you a braking distance of 1,100ft (1/5 of a mile), while 75mph allows you to stop in 311ft.  

150mph is *NEVER* as safe as 75mph, if not just because of the above, but also (more rarely) because the consequences of a random mechanical failure are greater at higher speeds.  A blowout at 150mph will be more likely to kill you than at 75mph.

I'm not saying that I never ride fast or exceed the speed limit, but I am saying that those of us that do shouldn't delude ourselves into believing that we're not taking an additional risk by doing so.  If not for our own sake, for the sake of not leading newer riders to make the mistaken assumption that riding at ludicrous speeds isn't really all that dangerous.  It is dangerous, that's a fact - no amount of rationalizations will change that.  

45% of motorcycle fatalities don't involve another vehicle at all, we can't pretend that motorcyclists only get killed because we get t-boned at intersections by cars.  Taking huge risks because you're uninformed about how risky an action is isn't bravery, it's stupidity.  If you understand the risks and still want to take them, that's on you, but let's not pretend here that riding 150mph isn't incredibly dangerous...","1372637376"

Caliborn; the hatred of the comic, the immaturity, dubbed names (homostuck), hatred of the fanart (Caliborn ruined Calliope's drawing of Meenah and Vriska), and the parody of the comic (Act 6 Act 6).

"exatheist","t5_2rull","&gt;Atheists see only the avoidance of intellect happening in religion, but I find endless opportunities for the deliberate and repeated engagement of intellect. 

Well, if I may, religion to me is just one source of anti-critical thinking if I may put it that way. People have to be trained in critical thinking and reason to be able to think with a sound structure to their thoughts, it's just not something that comes naturally. I'm not saying that only educated people have the right to think, not at all, education too often is more about acquiring knowledge and far too rarely about actually thinking about that information. What I'm saying is that there is this unreason of the human mind, and religions exploit this and spread it around as much as they can to have more converts. *That's* what I stand against, the spreading or unreason.

&gt;And frankly, the tendency to only accept empirically verifiable statements as being part of truth seems to me a deliberate avoidance of the intellect. 

What other kinds of statements do you accept as part of the truth? I'm not sure what you mean when you're talking about non-empirically verifiable statements, it is too vague for me to agree or disagree.","1372637379"

"formula1","t5_2qimj","I know that people say 'Hamilton is aggressive', 'Mr big shot' 'celebrity' blah blah. 

But you have to give it to him. As a person, he has one of the strongest mind and heart. I am sure that it must have hurt Alonso last year not winning the championship but i am also sure that  Hamilton was hurt even more, 3-4 retirements from lead with no fault of his own and knowing that he had the fastest car to win races/champion ship. Utter bad luck

And again this year (its only one race so far and I hope its only one). To get pole by that margin on his home turf, and then producing a 3-4 second lead in 8 laps and still lapping faster than anybody else. And suddenly, tyre fail at sector one. Even me as a fan, I was just thinking might as well retire as its no point. But holding together until the end and delivering a solid 4th from last.....incredible. And same goes to massa. Massa has driven one of his best race in a very long time....

Hamilton has the worst luck let's hope he becomes one of the title contenders. Would love to see kimi/alo/ham/vet fight it out. And I would especially enjoy if mark joins it too (as a big fan of Hamilton, a part of me wants webber to win 2013 wdc)

Not going to lie, i was jumping up and down while my siblings were watching (i dont do this at all). Had Hamilton overtook Alonso......","1372637386"

I'm also thinking of delving into the solo experience offered by certain games, such as Space Empires 4X, and Field Commander Alexander/Napoleon.  Maybe pen my thoughts on what makes a good iPad port.

TLDR: Timeline is a light, friendly trivia game where you only roughly need to know historical trivia.  The artwork on each card has some hints, and you only need to be able to place events relative to one another.  There was a real sense of exploring history together in my playgroup, as everyone silently guessed when an event took place while the active player talked it out.  My only concern is overplay, since after 3 or 4 games in a row, you'll begin to see the same cards which is a let down.","1372637390"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Keep in mind I'm just starting out. I'm only a little bit more ahead in the game than you are. So far I've dealt with kids in general dentistry which is like the family dentist you most likely go to. They do all ages for the most part. They do things like fillings and crowns and other relatively simple things. Some general dentists also like doing their own root canals but they usually recommend people to endodontists who basically do root canals all day long. Pediatrics is of course all kids all day long. They do things like pulling teeth, placing sealants so that its harder for children to get cavities, and dealing with the kids the general dentists didn't want to deal with (kids who are very upset and refuse to have their teeth pulled) along with things you would do for adults, just child sized. Kids can definitely be a handful but trust me, some adults are just as bad if not worse. Being patient and sympathetic about the things that concern them which might sound irrational to others is the key to being great in pediatrics. You can specialize in pediatrics just like you can orthodontics. I can't really think of any other specialists that work with children. I'm fairly certain oral surgeons work on cleft palate cases. Like I said, orthodontics builds a relationship with your patients. You get to witness these kids grow A LOT over the course of two or so years and that can be really cool. It's also rewarding when the kid actually Wants braces because its like you're doing them a favor and improving their life rather than torturing them, as they see it. I've interned at a lot of places and the orthodontist I worked for was by far the most laid back office. They were happy to be there and their patients were happy to see them. Ok I'm ranting now, I'm sorry. I really like dentistry, like to the point of it being weird. ","1372637394"

Redditor for 3 months - OK, here is what I see.
Your posts are to default subs. It's easy to get lost in a sea of posts to a sub with, like this one, over 2.5 Million subscribers. If you are looking for that big scoring crack hit of karma, good luck. Without gaming the system it's just luck. Besides there is so much more to reddit, and you. Reddit isn't just /r/AdviceAnimals, /r/pics, and /r/funny. Neither are you. What are you into? What do you like? Where are you from? There are subs for all of these things and more, so much more. Get more involved in the comments. Make a provocative statement, then back it up. Post to /r/toiletselfies, they will never see it coming!

Karma accrues from action, its momentum. If you want more karma you need more action. [You can do it!](http://rugbyea.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/you-can-do-it.jpg)  Most of all, get outside the defaults. You're less likely to hit that big karma home-run, but your more likely to have fun. The karma will come and you won't even notice it.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;That doesn't mean I oppose it for people who still could pose a threat (so please don't take that approach), it means I oppose it for already apprehended individuals who have been convicted of a crime.

I'm not sure I understand this part. You don't oppose it for people who still could pose a threat? Please explain further.

1. I don't see the death penalty as ""righting a wrong"". It is getting rid of a dangerous individual, permanently ensuring that he or she will no longer trouble society ever again. If you think being given life in prison will guarantee society that safety, then you need to think again. There have been cases where criminals, who have been given life in prison, were let out on parole only to repeat their actions upon society. Many innocent lives have been lost this way which could have been prevented.

2. It is only expensive because so many are against it, forcing a separate lengthy trial. If conviction and sentencing (including death sentences) are done in one trial, it would be a lot cheaper. After all, killing someone can be as free as locking them into an air-tight room. One can even make this profitable to society by removing their organs!

3. No real response to this I'm afraid. One thing I might add is that the conviction rate among blacks is vastly disproportionate to their population. However, racism almost certainly has something to do with this disproportionate rate, so I'm not sure how useful this statistic is, even though it is ""true"".

4. Taking a life *could* save lives. Not through deterrence perhaps, but through making a guarantee to society that one more criminal can never be a bother again. Same as point 1.  

5. Advances in technology have drastically reduced errors in trial. In light of this, the deaths of a few innocents is worth the cost, because it pays (albeit tragically) for the comfort that is safety.

At first, friction will hold the penny in place.  The penny will undergo circular motion AND the kicker is that the friction will induce a principal axis rotation in the penny as well.

Of course friction can eventually give way to non-inertial effects.  In this case I'd say until the moment the penny begins to slip either in rotation about its own principle axis or in the radial direction of the merry-go-round, the frictional force is a force of constraint.

"NeutralPolitics","t5_2tk0i","Nobody can demonstrate any particular injury yet because 1) nobody has to spend money right now since the State is making sufficient identification freely available and 2) no elections have been held under the regulation, so the hypothetical application of it is too vague to project certain serious injury (as opposed to, for example, giving polling places in minority communities unfeasible hours like 1AM-2AM, to which courts would be comfortable allowing a preemptive challenge). If, after the election, we have numbers that specifically show minorities registered and/or voted in significantly lower numbers than the trend before this law, and it can be shown that this law was the significant factor (and not, for example, a lack of interest because there was no longer a minority presidential candidate, for instance), then the law might be overturned and the election may be ordered redone in full or part with a new map (probably the last legal map). However, I believe the court may consider the additional cost the state will incur in redoing the election as a factor for whether or not it is redone.

I opened up Notepad on my computer and wrote myself a letter in which I would read every time I got a craving and needed a voice of reason (I live in a house of smokers, so they are no help!).  I left the letter open so I could just pull it up whenever I had a bad craving.  My inner addict would start the withdrawal symptoms and the justifications for just having a puff to make it easier, but instead of searching for a cigarette butt or running to town for a pack, I would open up the letter and hear my own voice saying it would be alright, that I can get through it.  I only needed it a few times, but it really helped calm my brain down long enough to get through the cravings.  3 weeks into quitting and instead of hair-pulling anxious cravings I had the first few days, my cravings are nothing more than little thoughts about smoking, and not really even the desire to have one.  Keep at it, take each craving as they come and remember they will pass, and stay strong.  Pretty soon you'll be free from this monster!  Congratulations on making the decision!","1372637417"

This doesn't necessarily mean harden gets less shots.In a 4-out-1-in situation the lane will not be that clogged, especially if you're surrounded by shooters. I can only imagine this creates more driving lanes for harden, and if the defense does collapse he'll have the kick out or the lob to Dwight. Just my thoughts.","1372637422"

You aren't forced to grind enemies in it either as you only get XP from quest rewards, so you just go around doing the quests, and none are like ""go find X of this"" quests at all. One thing I will recommend is that you try finish every quest in every zone. You'll get much stronger that way and it's easy to miss quests, as the only way to get them is explore every building and talk to everyone.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I dabble in photography, IR and normal, so I know how this works. Perhaps I should have been more verbose. It's like this:

You put an IR filter in front of the lens. It lets longer wavelengths (IR) pass and cuts off shorter wavelengths (visible light). The transition between pass and block is somewhat gradual, so if you use something like a common 720nm filter, there'll still get a bit of visible through. Mainly red, of course. But anyway, after the light has passed the lens it hits the sensor, which commonly is equipped with a [Bayer matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter). That is, tiny red, green and blue filters.

Now, the IR light that came in will hit ALL sensor elements, regardless whether they are of the red, green or blue kind. Sure, the red pixels (or rather sensels) will register the most intensity, but it's not like the blue sensels will completely block the IR light. They weren't designed to do that. The ""[hot-mirror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_mirror)"" (IR block filter) that usually sits in a separate glass in front of the sensor does that - and it's this part that you surgically remove from cameras that you want to make IR sensitive.

TL;DR: a Bayer type sensor has tiny red, green and blue filters, so it automatically records in ""color"" and not grayscale. And even if you just let near IR light into the camera, you'll get pseudo color anyway.

But because I would be treating it as a tower shield that would mean no bashing.

&gt;You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.

And nothing else really while using it, as both hands would be occupied.

I would like to add that without [improved shield bash](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-shield-bash-combat---final) you loose the bonus to AC until you next turn.

2. Get either:

* Sorcerer's Shoes - More damage
* Boots of mobility - More running around the map (Stacks with your W)

3. Depending on the situation I get 1 or 2 of these:

* Liandry's Torment - Great item, Especially if they're stacking HP against you
* Zhonya's Hourglass - You can bait really hard with it - ult and run into the intire team and spam abilities. Use it when they focus you and let the rest of your team clean up. If I'm really behind, I get it right after my boots because by the time I get it teamfights/skirmishes are already happening and i wanna bait people
* Rilay's Crystal Scepter - If you need tankyness and wanna kite people
* Abyssal Scepter - Good item overall, even better if you wanna deal with a fed AP or a Double/Triple AP Comp

4. From here, I go tanky with:

* Sunfire cape - obvious reasons, Hp + Armor
* Iceborn Gauntlet - It's actually really good - you might want it insted of Rilay's for slowing (depends on do you want HP or Armor + CDR)
* Randuin's Omen - Standard jungle item, must have vs autoattacker teams based on attack speed

**NOTE:** you can also go full AP and do a ton of damage but you pretty much need Hourglass in that scenario. I prefer to get at least 1 or 2 tanky items.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","The ranking is not there for entertainment or to determine which team is the best. (That’s what the World Cup is there for.) As you might have noticed, FIFA does not hand out trophies for being #1 in the ranking. You only get trophies for actually winning a tournament.

The rankings are just a tool, for all those situations when, during the organisation of a tournament, merit-based decisions are desirable but it’s not possible to play actual games to find out who merits what. The ranking necessarily works with very incomplete information since national teams play very infrequently against each other. (Just consider that even league tables can be controversial – with people often proclaiming that this or that team was not deserving of this or that spot – and those teams play against each other in the league twice a year. Before tonight Brazil last played against Spain in 1999.)

Also, hosts of the World Cup are at a special disadvantage since they do not play any qualifying games.

Now, I’m not saying that the ranking is perfect – but the methodology for how it is calculated is public and if you want to you are free to improve on it. The difficult thing is not finding cases in which the model might not be completely perfect, the challenge is actually creating some sort of algorithm that automatically and without any human value judgements along the way creates great results no matter what – from the available and very incomplete information.","1372637429"

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","&gt; Deeper down, subconsciously, people want control over other people.

Holy projection, batman.

I certainly don't want control over other people. Perhaps many, many fewer people do than you are telling yourself. And even if you do want it, that is vastly different from feeling that you are _entitled_ to it.

&gt; Monogamy is a protection policy really.

And this is high on the list of reasons that monogamy seems to me like an unhealthy way to run a relationship.

I don't want someone to be with me just because they feel like they don't have any choice, or haven't been able to explore other options. The idea of coercing or pressuring or tricking someone into being with me by denying them contact with anyone else seems abhorrent.

I want someone to be with me _because they choose to be with me_. Because, even with all the other options in the world open to them, I am the person that they actually wish to be with. Corralling them into it by taking away their choices defeats the entire purpose.

The thing that your ""protection policy"" is protecting you from is your partner's free will.

"HPMOR","t5_2t5xf","Now I am a sad panda.  :-(  This has pretty much ruined my weekend.  And made me not want to re-read HPMOR again.

My go-to move for these sort of things is to list the potential problems and inconsistencies that I find in the work in question.  I will do so here.  Unfortunately it is not April 1st, so it's unlikely that these problems indicate that this is a fake chapter.  Some of these things are also meta.

I know this phrase is vastly overused on this sub-reddit, but *I notice that I am confused*.  There seem to be too many strange things going on here to take everything at face value and just accept what we've read as reality.  This entire thing is designed to be *Harry's* personal worst case scenario.  A worst case scenario, aimed specifically at him.  Some things here can be taken as coincidences, but chapter 89 is suspect.

As somebody else here mentioned, this whole thing is reminiscent of the Kobayashi Maru simulation in Star Trek 2.  The worst case scenario, with a lot of sound and fury, hopefully signifying nothing.

Now that I've had time to sleep on this, and to outline all the potential problems in the chapter, my guess is that this whole thing was orchestrated by Dumbledore.  This entire thing was performed is as stupidly and clumsily as Dumbledore is.  It's not nearly at the level of Quirrell, and there are several indications that Quirrell didn't do this.  Dumbledore knows what Harry's worst nightmares are from viewing McGonnagall's memories from chapter 6, and uses them to create a plausible - to Harry - scenario, which he uses to remove Hermoine from the picture, and therefore hide one of Harry's weak points.

My guess is that Dumbledore brought in the troll and killed it on the roof, creating sufficient mess.  When Harry arrived, Dumbledore memory-charmed him and the Weasly twins to believe that there was a battle, arranging everything.  The discontinuities in Harry's perception are because of the imperfect memory charm.  Hermoine herself was hidden, and there were no decent witnesses to the event.  Since the wizard world has no forensic scientists, there is also no chance that somebody would detect a fake corpse.

So, here are the strange/new things in these two chapters that make me suspicious and/or confused:

1.  Pretty much *everything* that can go wrong here does go wrong.  It's like the worst case scenario realized.  That's usually an indication of either a depressed author or a nightmare/hallucination within the story.  As someone here pointed out, it's as suspect as the Kobayashi Maru test at the beginning of Star Trek 2, where several of the main characters just lie down and die.  This seems to be too simple, just like in the Kobayashi Maru test, and everyone suddenly falls over dead.

2.  There is no reason for anyone to bring in the troll - there is no excuse of making it a defense barrier for the 3rd floor corridor this time around.

3.  The troll just *happens* to find Hermoine in a giant castle?  After capturing and eating a small cat - but not going after Filch himself?  And then chases down a smaller prey for some reason?

4.  Everyone in the great hall refuses to think and acts like an NPC, even people trained by Harry - exactly like Harry told McGonnagall in chapter 6.  With the exception of Ron of all people.  And Neville refuses to obey Harry's orders.

5.  The Patronus solution comes to Harry a minute or two too late - exactly as late as it needs to come to guarantee the outcome.  It's a little too neat.  Perhaps the outcome was triggered or timed by Harry's arrival?  Can a Patronus be fooled to go to the wrong person and to carry the wrong persons' message?  For example, will a Patronus be fooled by Polyjuice and carry back the message of the Polyjuiced person, or will it go to the original?

6.  Weasly twins somehow get out of the hall with nobody noticing.

7.  Weasly twins are inexpertly memory-charmed, in a very dumb way.  First indication that Quirrell didn't do it - that this was concocted by somebody much clumsier than him.

7.  Weasly twins somehow think of calling the hat to them.  In the middle of battle.  For some strange reason.  And remember the words.  And it works.  And is useful.  How &amp; why would they think of this?

8.  Weasly twins somehow know that they need to pull the sword out of the hat.  How did they find out about this?  Did the hat tell them that when it appeared on one of their heads?

9.  Disjointed writing.  Purpose?  Is it to indicate that Harry is emotionally affected or is it something else?

10.  First time in 500k words that we see something from Quirrell's point of view.  Why - is it to explicitly show that he did not personally see what happened?

11.  First time in 500k words that we hear that Quirrell has a mental link to Harry.  Why - is it used by the author as an indication that this appeared to be real *to Harry* - and thus potentially not real for other people?

12.  Harry's strange perception of reality (or ""reality"").  He has been in tight spots before, but as far as I remember has never had temporal anomalies in his memory.  Is this an indication of a memory charm placed on him?  He has explicitly trained himself to be an objective observer, to see things as they are, in the specific order that they appear.

13.  Quirrell doesn't see what happened with his own eyes - which means that we have only one trained and sane person &amp; observer on the scene - Harry.  And his observations are potentially suspect because of his emotional involvement and sudden disjointed perception of reality.

14.  Harry almost exactly predicted what would happen when he bought the med kit way back in the 6th chapter.  It's almost as if somebody found out that this was Harry's personal nightmare, and *recreated* it just to specifically affect *Harry*.  Or to fit Harry's perceived worldview?

15.  Dumbledore is rather calm, relatively speaking - although that could just be because of Harry's perceptions.

The only hole in this logic chain that I can think of is the Patronus.  We don't know if it can be fooled.  Dumbledore doesn't know that Harry knows how to communicate using Patronuses, or that a Patronus can be used to lead you somewhere.  As far as Dumbledore is aware, Harry's knowledge of the capabilities of a Patruns is rudimentary - nor could he predict that Harry would think of using a Patronus in that way.  Which means that Hermoine probably was in the castle, at the scene of the battle.  And she probably did say ""AHHHHHHHHH!"" - although the exact circumstances of that are unknown (could she have been startled by a sudden appearance of a glowy person?).  That is probably the only solid fact we know for certain - things start to break down only in chapter 89.","1372637431"

If you just throw it and miss you lose a lot of pressure.

You have to understand all of the matchups. You have to know all of the strengths and weakness' of every lane combo. Sona cait is a poke comp but they are weak to engage to start an engage at a good time.

You have to understand champion strengths individually. ex Twitch can do a lot of burst but has long cooldowns so you can fight him then.

You have to understand the importance of wave control. if you fight with a lot of enemy creeps you will take a lot of damage from them.

You have to understand the importance of vision. You control all vision and vision wins games.

Strong champs are: Nami, zyra, lulu, sona, thresh, blitzcrank, janna. Basically anything but taric.

I forgot to add that you have a ton of control over the game. Pro support players get to high ladder positions on only support. If they can do it why can't you.","1372637436"

"WhereDoIStart","t5_2xpnz","I would add **Coheed and Cambria** because their entire albums are one huge storyline based on a world created by its frontman Claudio Sanchez.  He also published comic books based on the story of his albums, as well as a novel that he wrote with his wife.  I would start with Second Stage Turbine, In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3, Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness, and Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow.

Then listen to their latest double album which is also another storyline played out within the same universe: The Afterman: Ascension and The Afterman: Descension 

----------------------

I should also note **The Dear Hunter** concept album, ""The Color Spectrum"".

The albums is based on 9 EPs that are named after each color of the spectrum including its extremes black and white. Each EP is inspired by the color is named after, for example Black is very industrial rock, while green is very folksy and so on.  The frontman and creator of the band, Casey Cresenzo, said this about the project:
*Anything we think of, we can do. Humanity's idea of colors is too broad. This needs to be more personal, because ideas of colors vary from person to person. Even for people who have synesthesia, the specific images or sounds they hear attached to colors vary from person to person. And that just reinforces the point of doing the project, to produce our interpretation of color, the way we feel about colors or are inspired by the colors - how we hear them or see them.*

Indigo and Violet are my favorite EPs. Here is a link of the entire [album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upbXSbgs5T8).

"investing","t5_2qhhq","You are not a value investor, so please stop trying to belittle my ideas.  

Oh my god, you think Apple is a high beta stock.  I have come across to so many people that use this metric as a turn away.  Apple's beta, not that it matters is .76, meaning it is 76% as volatile as the overall market, i.e. not high beta.  It does have large momentum swings and is in the tech segment, not as stable as a utility stock.  

You mistake value investors for people who do not like to take risk.  Many times value investors invest in companies that are ""doomed to fail"" by the market, in other words Apple right now.  Obviously some times these doomed to fail comments are tru, but through analysis I have come up to think Apple is undervalued.  

Again NOT HIGH BETA, I appluad your use of caps though.  

Beta is not a fundamental indicator either, but a very technical one.  Beta should never be confused with risk.  

As long as gross profits improve, hell I do not care if they even stay the same.  Apple is worth 232 bn minus its cash at hand, or at least last time I checked.  They also pay a significant 3% dividend.  Their net income for 2012 was almost 42 bn.  5 years of this, excluding dividends, cash on hand exceeds market cap, suggesting no net income improvement or lowering.  It has been 6 years since the original iPhone came out, 3 since the iPad.  If you believe they will all of a sudden sell less products, and never retain a high selling product again or high profitability, then you would short for the long term, but I believe they will pull through for the next 5 years. 

Doesn't matter what Wall St. thinks now, no one can argue cash at hand exceeding market cap!","1372637438"

For example, Dr.frankenstein thinks he can play god through science. He makes the Monster and it ends up a murderous abomination. By the end of the story he realizes playing god was morally wrong, that's his character arc, and also the point of the story.

It's a very fevered attempt to downplay and excuse what their government has been revealed as doing. 

It's pathetic. The people saying ""duh everyone knew this"" are trying to lie to themselves and fuel their own fragile ego, where previously they were the exact same people calling those who talked of such systems being in place conspiracy theory loving retards.

It's not unexpected though. I mean we're talking about a country that delusionaly believes that terrorists hate them ""because of their freedom"", who are made pledge allegiance to their flag at every given opportunity since they were first able to stand, who get *extremely* biased news from news sources controlled by 1 or 2 people, who believe their military is being used to ""protect"" those ""freedoms"", etc.

 Problem with America is that there has never been a break and rebirth of our power structure and we, and mostly our wealthy, are therefore liable and responsible for our horrific past and present. When we depose, upend, hold responsible, disown, and execute them to exterminate our society; we will too have a chance to aspire to the level Germany and other advanced societies have achieved.","1372637445"

Give me a break.

I've heard it interpreted that what happened at Mt. Sinai was the direct result of a massive mushroom poisoning and group hallucination. The difference being that that interpretation was actually put out by an actual biblical scholar in the first half of the 20th century who had some reasons for making that suggestion, and still no one in the academic world took his idea seriously.

To be extra clear, that is just an uninformed ""interpretation"" based on complete nonsense, but for some reason, every person thinks they have some kind of constitutional right to put forward whatever wacky suggestion they think is right, no matter how little basis in fact or reality it might have, and it is supposed to be treated as if they were on the same level as conclusions based on years of research across multiple fields.

You're complaining about something being a dumb choice when the show itself says ""NO THIS IS A DUMB CHOICE"".

1. To fight off the opposing fleet. Striker was the main threat, but not the only one. It wasn't ""written in"", it was foreshadowed in earlier episodes and has been present since the beginning. For reference, the Mass Driver is actually the same ""tower"" Ledo climbs in an earlier episode while being chased, races to the top on Amy's glider and then...sprays a massive cone of water all over the place. Also consider why the Gargantia is called the Gargantia considering the main vessel is basically an ocean-going installation housing a giant fucking railgun for shooting shit into orbit.

1. The pirates were direct thematic exploration of support structures in society and how they co-exist as well as giving early contrast between Ledo's values and those of Gargantian society. I don't understand the concerns over how long they spent playing generally lighthearted SoL episodes to set up Gargantian society and Ledo's intergration becasue it really isn't much. The Whalesquid ark basically starts at the end of episode 6 and gradually ramps up.

"wikipedia","t5_2qh3b","Medieval solitary is pretty different from modern day, being in the UK I'm lucky enough to have seen some dungeons where it took place. Back then it was just small spaces (a dungeon within a dungeon), e.g. at Warwick castle there is a small hole in the floor with a grill on top, just big enough for one person. The googles tells me it's called an ""oubliette"".

Modern solitary, when used as torture, is based around denying the prisoner all external stimuli. In a medieval dungeon they would hear the constant anguished cries of their fellow prisoners. 

Ultimately the objective is very different. A medieval interrogation would be aimed at getting you to admit to something already said by the torturer. A modern one is them trying to extract information. For the former all you have to do is be as unpleasant as possible; for the latter you need to truly ""break"" the person to learn their secrets (i.e. not just stuff they make up to make you stop hurting them).

I've been saying the OWS was a gigantic waste of time, you got the media, you were in the eye of every American, just when America was most receptive to new ideas, and you couldn't even articulate a message. Because you lacked a narrative, you became the story instead of the ends you were working towards. Your inability to get a message out meant your opponents used you as punching bags with impunity, and you became a symbol of everything wrong with millennials. 

So tell me why I'm wrong, tell me what you accomplished, tell me how a bunch of unemployed people living in a park for months on end represented the 99% faithfully. Give me your grand scheme for your post capitalist utopia, share OWS's deep and thoughtful underpinnings. ","1372637456"

The secret to the flip is courage, if you hesitate you will get a half flip or let the egg hit too hard. I taught myself to flip over the sink, but if you have a dog handy you can do it at the stove. Some pans won't flip; the top edge needs to be vertical, if it is still sloping at the edge you will have to chase the egg which is harder to master. A dozen eggs is less then $2, it's worth the investment in practice. Keep the pan hot, the butter gets stiff and harder to flip when it cools. Again, courage is the key; I can flip 4 eggs at once if I show no fear.","1372637459"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You swine. You vulgar little maggot. Don't you know that you are pathetic? You worthless bag of filth. As we say in Texas, I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.

You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you. You are a bloody nardless newbie twit protohominid chromosomally aberrant caricature of a coprophagic cloacal parasitic pond scum and I wish you would go away.

You're a putrescence mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.

You are a bleating fool, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf,  meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.

I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?

If you aren't an idiot, you made a world-class effort at simulating one. Try to edit your writing of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.

You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.

You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.

And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?

You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.

On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.

I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed.  Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.

The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ""challenged"" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been ""right"". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Tbh I haven't played lol, so I'm just looking at the mechanics as I understand them from watching.

My argument is more that RPGs are not inherently more addictive, not so much that individual games are or are not. All games encourage that ""one more turn"", that ""one more round"", that ""extra hour"" by either story or growth, but there are specific elements that make games addictive. It doesn't appear that lol shares that. 

Points for success, failure, or attempts are universal. StarCraft is an inherently competitive game, designed to reward skill and success and punish failure -- but it does this as a motivator. Some people at disheartened by loss of points or score, others are emboldened by it and strive to improve. StarCraft absolutely has those elements. I wouldn't call it an addictive game by default, but there will be those who find it so.

WoW was initially designed to be fun and engaging. Since then, they've found that addictive elements hold players longer, and have made those core parts of the game. It is literally the crack of the game world. Most MMOs follow similar designs as a means of keeping gamers engaged. Open world RPGs tend to have several addictive elements (stuff collecting, upgrading, leveling, improvement scores), but that has more to do with the dynamic of the game itself.

Story-driven RPGs lack much of that, but even strategy games can have those elements. See the civilization series for an example, or any of the sudo-strategy games online these days. Every triple A style FPS is the same thing, but given the developers are aware of it (like wow), it's taken advantage of to the point of increased revenue streams (soft drink tie ins, snack bonuses, pay-to-win). 

RPGs just aren't by default addictive. MMOs are, because that's how you keep your players playing when you're out of ideas. Online FPS are, because they can sell more to the players. Bejeweled wasn't addictive on purpose, but the remakes sure were -- which is why people who play it have it for every format they own.

Lol may not be healthy, but WoW is literally crack. ","1372637463"

For Spain the question will be whether this was a tactical or personnel failure; people have been talking about the demise of tiki taka since Barca's defeat to Bayern...would cleaner or more inspired individual performances have let Spain play more like they did in extra time against Italy, or has the current iteration if tiki taka been 'solved' by teams that have the energy to press consistently? What can Spain do better against that tactic? Or do they just need to pay their own game better, and do they have anyone who can do that?

I only put them on when I'm at home in my apartment, because that's when I pick (I don't have an issue at work or out in public). When my urge is high, I actually have to put 6 band-aids on my fingers (thumbs, pointers, and middle fingers) to truly prevent myself from picking. It does cost money, but you can find cheap band-aids, and it is well worth it in my opinion. You can also try using something as a ""competing response,"" like playing with silly putty or something like that.

Another option is to do something more nourishing and soothing, like moisturizing gloves when you're at home. Put on some nice hand moisturizer and slip on the gloves. It will feel less suffocating when you know you are doing something to help heal and nourish your hands.","1372637471"

Letting them get the money is not the problem. The problem , which in your case is mutual aid, is the mechanism in conducting the aid. For example, taxes or scholarships etc.

You also advocated anarchy. Assuming we all agree that socialism is the best, anarchy-based communism would'nt work because of implementation problem. Who will be the one giving the stuffs to people? Communism is all about giving fair share to everyone right? So it all depends on people getting the share. We can look at poor countries in Africa; the problem isn't that the world is not giving aid, it's the people who are getting the aid is not getting them due to weak government. 

So, in my opinion, anarcho-communism wouldn't work even if I can agree communism can work ( which I don't)","1372637471"

You are claiming to support a scientist whose only ""achievement"" is to ignore the scientific model, to fail peer review and to just state ""Well, scientific dogmas are wrong!""

His only support is discredited anecdotal evidence. 

So no, you are not responding logically to my posts; however, you are placing yourself (and Sheldrake) outside of the verifiable spectrum, and there's no point discussing with someone who isn't accepting the basic framework for validating accuracy of claims.

Again; extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Refusing to provide evidence is unacceptable.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'm glad to see you're responding to commenters with sarcasm now. It's always conducive to an actual discussion of the various pros and cons of having kids at different ages.

But seriously, I don't think that the desire to have kids is a good reason to get married when you aren't otherwise ready to be. I don't think anyone should settle in their twenties just to have children. I don't think it's generally a good idea career-wise and life experience-wise to have kids before 25 or so. But I also think that putting it off too long is a bad idea. I don't encourage people to marry young and start trying to have kids just so they can have them young, but I do think that the increasing risks after age 35 or 40 shouldn't be shrugged off as basically non-existent. 

There are a lot of things to consider when planning children, and the best age will vary by person. If you consider your lifestyle, your personal and professional goals, where you are in your romantic and personal life and where you think you'll be in 2 or 5 or 10 or 15 years, *and* the increased risks of a late pregnancy, and you then decide that it's best for you to wait until you're 35 or 40 to start having kids, then that's good for you. 

Different people will have different priorities, and so if my health and my children's health isn't worth the risk to me and I want to have kids in my late 20s instead of my late 30s, then that's no better worse than you deciding that the risks were worth it and having kids in your early 40s. Sometimes it happens by chance. My mom didn't have kids younger because she didn't meet my dad til she was 35. That's ok, too. I just think it's important to *consider* the potential health risks if you're already in a committed relationship and you're thinking about when to have kids, and I don't think it's necessarily good to just dismiss them like you have.","1372637475"

"history","t5_2qh53","I'm not a geologist so can't really comment in depth. 

Dating the Sphinx securely is an ongoing debate even within the academic community; some propose it predates Khafre and was built by his immediate predecessors (like Khufu), some even date it back to the Early Dynastic Period.

I am very much inclined to think that, regardless of its exact date, it is attributable to the Egyptians and not to some earlier civilisation. This anonymous civilisation that is proposed has, for whatever reason, defied the trends and left *nothing* else to proclaim their existence except a limestone monument. Occam's Razor favours an Egyptian origin.

It's entirely possible that the monument is older than conventionally thought; dates shift *a lot* in Egyptology, and since Climatology is appearing more and more in the historical-science of Egyptology it is possible that an explanation will be found that locks down the Sphinx's date for good. 

At the moment, there isn't much that can be securely said except ""We think it was built by Khafre, but aren't sure. It's 99.9% likely to be Egyptian.""","1372637476"

I mean did they teach people the origins of the Jews who came from Europe to be originally middle eastern? Or as European converts (Khazarian) ? Also do they teach that Israel is a majority western Jewish or majority eastern Jewish country? And if the view of Israel being a majority of eastern people would that change the attitude of the Syrians? Or is it irrelevant? Or is that not addressed at all? Sorry about all these questions that you might think are silly or whatever, but I am very interested to know the average Syrian young adult views on these things and i never was able to get into an honest discussion with someone living in Syria. So would you say that the Syrians will put the national interest of the Palestinians above their own national interest if these two contradict each other? I mean to ask, if the relationship with Israel would benifit Syrians nationally would the majority of the people prefer to put the Palestinian national cause above their own interests? ","1372637484"

"Steam","t5_2qwis","For games that use steam only, Like the CoD frnachise, steam is their DRM, and have the cost of CD-Key assigning built into their game fees

Im assuming Valve dont just say ""here have some free CD Key assign-ings"" to developers with games also on steam, but sold physically, otherwise Valve would make no money.

Games without Steam-keys, means that the developer can continue offering games to people the Old-fashioned way. 

Meaning;

- Developer can spend less on the game (save costs by not having to buy 1 steam activation key per game) 

- Can reap more of the gross margin on their game. (they get more money)

It is basically all down to cost. For a Physical retail copy of a game, you have to go to a store and buy it. why would they pay extra for another company (Steam/Valve) to benefit

Steam's advantage is people can make purchases from home, and developers can get sales from the users who never buy physical copies.

TL;DR - Developers are not going to sacrifice their profit margin (how much they make on their game) just so you can activate your game on another company's infrastructure (unless they gain direct business value)

EDIT: Additionally, Valve arnt going to go out of their way to find a list of all the CD keys for Spore out of the kindness of their heart, because this would 

- waste valve resources

- The Developer would additionally never send a list of CD-keys, as they are incredibly important to their business","1372637489"

The FSA is indeed a terrorist organization. Many countries recognize them as such. They're VERY far from a 'secular' organization. I wish that you were correct. There are factions within the FSA that are trying to get rid of the Islamists, but that's an uphill battle. We all know they're woefully outnumbered. 

Just because the Obama administration is on the wrong side and refuses to call a spade a spade doesn't mean that the FSA isn't made up of almost exclusively radical Islamists. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Syrian_Army#Relationship_with_Islamists

No, treaties be damned, we don't have to give a penny to The Muslim Brotherhood, or any other KNOWN TERRORIST GROUP currently running Egypt. There's nothing keeping our current administration from telling these radicals to go piss up a rope. Read up on the power of the Presidency in terms of foreign relations.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_brotherhood#Criticisms

So, basically what we have is a handful of wars and uprisings in the Middle East that are bad guys fighting worse guys. 

We shouldn't pick a side. 

I have spent zero seconds watching Fox News for as long as I can remember. Please note that I refused to denigrate you for getting your talking points from MSNBC &amp; Al Jazeera. 

And for you folks who watch MSNBC, 'denigrate' means 'to put down, to insult'.

The Iranians do support the Assad regime, and they also funnel weapons to the FSA. They're trying to play both sides.

As far as Syria goes, there is no correct side or us to chose. Our sworn enemies are fighting our even worse sworn enemies. My personal policy would be: ""Let them kill each other. Who gives a fuck?"" 

In short, it is you, sir, who needs to be educated about problems in the ME. Either that or you know I'm correct, but you're such an Obama shill lackey that you chose to take all of your talking points from Obama himself and Media Matters. 

There isn't a single conflict in the ME that we should be getting involved in today period unless Israel is directly attacked, and they pretty much know how to take care of themselves.","1372637495"

No you cannot. if you stick a card from your 3DS in a different 3DS, you will not be able to access the games or saves on it. You need to do a system transfer for that, and it is not a process you an repeat indefinitely. ","1372637497"

There may be no correlation between the bump in the road. Do you know if you looked behind the vehicle when it had the damage? Was there a trail at all of any fluids? It may be worth it to go back and see. If not, I would at least investigate the damage done to the vehicle. It would be possible that the location of the last oil change created a leak that over time created no remaining oil in the engine causing engine failure. Was there ever a red oil can light that came on while driving? From your description, it sounds as through a lower engine failure occurred. This would make sense that someone wants to put an engine in it. If a timing belt failure occurred you would just have an engine stall, valve damage would occur and it would be as if you turned the car off. If you took it to a local shop it would definitely not cost a couple hundred to diag, I work at a mom and pop shop that if you towed it to me then we would ask at most an hour labor which for smaller shop is one labor hour. Search Yelp and find someone reputable if you really want to know what happened. I have seen rocks come and hit the oil pan so hard it knocked a hole and drained the oil and then the engine blew up. I have also seen shops cross thread the drain plug in the oil pan causing the oil to slowly drain and then finally BOOM. Would you be able to maybe send me pictures? maybe even under the car? How many miles on this car? and is this a 4 cylinder model?","1372637500"

Once it's set up, not only does the s3 give step by step instructions when first using it, it's quite simply the easiest android to use. The great thing about Android is that everything you *need* is on the home screens, and the play store adds apps there now by default.

Make more than 2 cannons. Making them is a start, I see almost no toss' who make cannons to begin with, but they always have maybe 3 at the most and it's all powered by 1 pylon. Can't do that. Line the edge of your min line/tech structures when you have free minerals, gotta spend them somehow. Station maybe 1 or 2 HT at your main and nat, and move them but keep them near the cannons, and when the zerg moves in to try and kill the cannons lay down storms and one behind him for when he tries to run away. Just 1 storm won't keep me back, mutas regen hella fast. 

I know, I go muta--&gt;ultra pretty much every game minus ZvZ. But if you've got your units at their door and their mutas are away, push in and make him pull back to defend or lose his tech/eco, and warp in some templar at home and turn them into archons to defend with. 

I probably have a skewed view of it, but it's not extremely hard to beat if you know the counters and can spread him thin enough that he can either lose all his tech to a zealot warp or he can pull back and defend. ","1372637503"

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","Well first, you need to understand the weapon loadouts you have.

The Banshee is an anti infantry nosegun. It will rip through infantry like no other. But it's velocity and damage are horrible for damaging any vehicle. 

The Needler, which is your default nosegun, is a good all around weapon. Not a bad choice to equip if you don't know what you will be coming up against. 

The M18 rotary is the Anti Aircraft nosegun. It has a high rate of fire and a little less accuracy, but this excels for A2A combat and isn't too bad at damaging infantry and vehicles, though it isn't ideal for that either.

Rocketpods are the go to for many ESF builds, as they can be effectively used against pretty much anything and everything, aircraft included, though again they are intended for and only idea for Air to Ground attacks. 

Tomcat missiles are lock on A2A missiles. Honestly, they aren't all that great to begin with and if you are a beginning pilot you should really stay away from them until you can fly well enough without them.

So really, you need a good loadout when you pull your mossie. The one you have isn't too bad - The Banshee + Rocketpods that is - but is it almost 100% anti infantry, with rocketpods giving some coverage for anti vehicle but almost nothing for anti air. Even the best pilots cannot reliably use rocketpods as an anti aircraft defense, noseguns are the go to a2a option. 

So I would look at running you banshee with afterburners to get away from trouble fast. If you have the rotary, use that with rocketpods for one of the most versatile builds on any ESF ever. The rotary gives good coverage for all vehicles, some decent anti infantry, and then rocketpods are good for coverage on all targets. ","1372637512"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","the problem IMO isn't the loan system, it's the private schools and ignorant students who aren't educated about the value of money.

without counting room &amp; board costs (since students can live cheap or be ballers if they want), most state universities charge on average like 10k/year, whereas private schools are usually around 30k. obviously at top tier/ivy league schools the premium might be worth it, but for most private schools the quality is similar to state schools.

from personal observation, a lot of my friends willingly took on student loan debt mostly because of superficial reasons, like ""the campus is way nicer"" or ""i'd rather be in the city than in a rural college town"". i think they're reasonable thoughts, but if i was a liberal arts major i wouldn't take out 100k in loans just so i could live in the city.

also at private schools, a lot of money goes into things like dorms and cafeterias...if you build luxury high rise dorms, students will borrow completely unreasonable amounts of money to live there. at my undergrad i calculated that someone SHARING a bedroom in a 3 bedroom luxury apartment on campus paid $1500/month. the cheapest meal plan came out to about $11/meal...assuming you ate every meal at the cafeteria. obviously it's cheaper to live off campus and cook yourself/eat fast food...but you can't borrow government money for off campus or groceries.

i might sound like a misanthrope, but a lot of the people i see who are complaining about student loans are regular middle-class people who made poor choices with regards to borrowing or with regards to their education.","1372637526"

Champions like meowkai hecarim amumu zac malphite go 9-21 definitely. actually amumu maybe even 0-21-9 grabbing buff duration in utility. Sometimes you'd want 21 in util. for nimbleness because hecarim's ad scales off of his bonus movement speed. Most junglers you'll want either armor reds OR ad with movespeed quints. Also shyvana is a GREAT jungler and ganker her damage is stupid but make sure your mid/top/support make up with crowd control (stuns etc) cause she has 0 crowd control unless you buy a frozen mallet. For champs like khazix lee zed if you jungle them and you're doing well go for the spirit lizard elder maybe last whisper then locket warmogs bulwark even. get a bulwark if their ap is fed or 2 ap's (top and mid.) champs like hecarim if doing well get the lizard elder if not get the spirit stone + kindlegem that tanky one, then go for iceborn gauntlet and tank items etc. XIN is a great ganker! his level 2/3 ganks are so fucking op especially against most mids because they run no armor runes. You can get 2 damage items on him then straight tank. And he'll carry the game with his kit/ganks. Also try not to take kills from mid/ad carry. Because especially if they ignite the enemy and you take it they'll get angry. Always say ""gj/well done"" to boost their self esteem and confidence and make them play better. I'd say learn to play maokai or shyvana really good gankers. Shyvana's clear time is really really good too. Mainly champions with aoe like mundo shyv etc are op.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Someone else said if your company offers a 401k to enroll as soon as you can. I second this. My company offers a regular 401k or a Roth 401k. The difference being the first is put into an account without being taxed, the second has been taxed already. The benefit being if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later in life, you'll have already paid taxes in the lower bracket (in theory at a lower rate). If your company doesn't offer one, look into opening one with a bank or some other company. 

I automatically have my bank put money into a savings account every time I get paid. I honestly never miss the money &amp; it definitely adds up. 

Finally while paying off debts, try to put more money on the debt with the higher interest rate if possible. Also, try to make more than the minimum payments when possible.

Brooks Brown, the kid there who has a cigarette tucked behind his ear in the photo, has gone on record saying that the group did that because they were big fans of Tarantino films, which was pretty prominent in pop culture at the time where they were. Obviously Eric and Dylan had more malevolent intentions, but  that could hardly have been ascertained at the time because of this. Personally, I think it would have been far eerier if they had given absolutely no sign of what they were intending, but they did not. There were far more notable warning signs: for example, Brooks and his family issued *17* complaints about Eric's violent behaviour over a year before they committed the massacre (including issuing death threats and making explosives), and a warrant was filled out but never filed by the police. That's where they could have been stopped, not through some ridiculous senior class photo.

The media made a *huge* deal of this photo at the time, and every time there's a thread remotely Columbine-related, someone posts the damn photo and everyone flips out all over again because some kids were making guns with their hands.

[Added bonus: here's an individual senior class photo where Dylan (on the left) was wearing a Reservoir Dogs shirt.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AL5AiwIDdQk/URWiLDInhAI/AAAAAAAAXe8/PdzjwSR2s7k/s400/Harris%2BKlebold.jpg) The media had a field day with this one, because of the words 'Serial Killer' - but really, would you assume everyone who wore a Tarantino shirt is a would-be murderer?

This kinda weakens your point.

Also the Turkish government is looking increasingly Islamist (banning alcohol advertisement and night sales, attempting and fortunately failing at several other conservative measures like banning the wearing of lipstick by airline stewardesses, etc.) - why do you think the secularists and liberals are filling the street?

I understand your point but you have to realize that having religion in government is a central tenet of Islam (sharia). When he says ""Islam demands that there be no such thing as separate state and religion,"" if you go by the Quran he's correct. This is why the remaining theocracies in the world today are all Islamic, without exception.","1372637536"

"conspiratard","t5_2r2dd","Basically any sort of functional^1 sociopathy. A good example of this would be Unit 731. A Japanese unit during World War II, they performed human experiments on Chinese and Russian prisoners. They performed living vivisection, injected prisoners with plague, connected the esophagus directly to the small intestines, and did a host of other such things. Now, unlike their counterparts in Nazi Germany, who were able to do such inhumane things because they saw their captives as less than human, Unit 731 saw their prisoners as humans. Just humans. Fear, pain, love - these were all just chemical reactions to be observed. Unit 731 hadn't come to their sociopathy like true sociopaths - physical neglect, little familial involvement, an early life of petty crimes, etc - but through reason. They had come to the conclusion that humans were mere biological machines to be exploited for understanding.

Now, we can argue about how reasonable that position is. Philosophers and logicians make a career out of declaring this or that position is logical or not and most of their disagreements are over far more trivial matters. The members of Unit 731 certainly thought they were using reason (just as the fundies who believe that Satan is trying to pass gay marriage used their faith) and they seemed to be pretty intelligent. I know that financial success is by no means an effective indicator of intelligence, but many of the doctors who worked on Unit 731 would go on to make millions using the knowledge and techniques they discovered and developed in a field which prides itself on having results.

Thinking of people as biological machines isn't unique to Unit 731 and, of course, most people who believe it don't make the jump to ""Let's testing flamethrowers on live captives"". It obviously requires something more than intelligence to make the jump. However, an idiot would cut you up because he wants your money or because he just likes causing pain. It takes a smart person to believe that cutting you to shreds^2 is part of an endeavor to push the frontier of human knowledge and is, thus, morally acceptable.

Anyway, I hope that is useful example. I definitely have more but I hope it's sufficient - typing this all out takes a bit of time.

^1 : By which I mean functional in the context of functionalism, i.e. that we can say things are the same because they have the same behavior, not functional in the context of psychology.

Your point, as far as I can see, was also that the government ought to change the name it uses for marriage. This is the point I have a problem with. ""Marriage"" is a concept shared by state and religion; but the state does not try to impose its definition on religions, while religions are trying to impose their definition on the state.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","We suspended the draft, since it is no longer necessary and infringed on people's freedom. The Zivildienst was the option for those who objected to being drafted for moral or religious reasons. Therefore it is in suspension, too.

 There are multiple voluntary replacements/ parallel programs. Especially middle class to upper class people apply for those to see the world for a year or do some work that benefits society.  
Friends of mine chose to work in Mexico, Nigeria, Romania or in the Philippines. Others chose to stay in Germany and work with children, the elderly or in alternative farming. Some even went to work for NGOs.

These voluntary programs allow for more freedom and valuable employment opportunities are no longer taken up by, what is in essence, forced labor. 

Since the pay isn't very good it's mostly middle to upper class kids though, whose parents can support them during this time. 

(PS: The reasons for suspending the draft were many and complicated. Most people never even got drafted, since they were either female or not medically fit enough or not there wasn't any space in the army at the time. So it turned into a punishment for physically fit males that were to lazy or dumb to cheat their way out of the system)","1372637550"

They'll just pretend it doesn't matter, hope someone else *maybe* does it, and go home, eat some maccaroni and cheese (fake powder cheese) and watch American Idol and the season finale of Dexter.


Other countries protest right.  They get out and make their voices heard.  America is so large it's hard for everyone who _will_ do something to get together in one spot.  Takes too long.  That's what I'm talking about.  Not specifically trying to crash helicopters you morons.","1372637551"

___

In the heat of battle, a shell falls near a waiting tank. It explodes and shakes the heavy armoured vehicle violently. Inside, two chaps are trying to enjoy afternoon tea.

""I say, what the bloody hell was that?"" Says the first, a cup of earl grey clutched in his gloved hand.

""Bloody hell..."" replies the other chap, looking down his lap where the tea has spilled and has left a large dark area. ""They've gone and made me spill my tea.""

A fury grows in the eyes of both men as they realize the extent of the devastation. In lockstep they put away the good china and place their helmets firmly on their heads.

""Old boy,"" says the first. ""I think its it's time you manned the turret... we've got manners to teach!""

Within seconds, the tank is lurching forward through the brush; its canon cannon glowing red from the relentless firing. The war cries of both men echoing from deep within the steel hull. On that day, the war was won. On that day, no more tea was spilled.","1372637558"

It was grade 6 and we ran an experiment to see how cigarette smoke affects plants (SPOILER ALERT: It kills them). So we grow this plant (tomato, I think) and put it under this giant glass jar/bottle.

Then we have the sole janitor for the school to come in every few hours, light a smoke, take a few drags and then put it in this rigged up cigarette holder inside the jar.

Even though it was a big upturned glass jar the smoke obviously leaked out, so for about a week the whole classroom smelled of cigarette smoke and there was always this janitor coming in a few times a day to light up in the classroom.

Slipping the punch means entering just outside the punch, or otherwise avoiding it, rather than blocking it.  In this context, it means ""slipping"" just outside.  That's irimi.  Of course, in this video, its not a throw, but if he had aimed a little bit outside the head, it would have been.

As far as uke falling down, it really just depends on how nage takes uke's balance.  You can see Doshu's uke doing this a little in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3VqdvBkrhk, and a little more in this one when things speed up: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlmAoQ5HYTk&amp;t=1m42s

Menstruation is **one part of puberty**. It does not equate to sexual maturity. A woman's uterus is not fully developed simply because she has menstruated. Meaning if Aisha had gotten pregnant when her marriage was consummated (age 9), she likely would have died during her pregnancy or during her delivery, especially considering that there was zero medical advancement back then. 

In fact, even today [girls under the age of 15 are more likely to die during pregnancy or giving birth](http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/component/content/article/436-adolescent-maternal-mortality-an-overlooked-crisis)

So how I got to that screen is like this:

The top icon on the left side of the screen.

Advanced

Encyclopedia

Shields

1GJ shields

That's the bottom of the Encyclopedia entry for 1GJ.

Looking it up in your game will tell you everywhere you can get it *in your game* because as the game progresses, everybody's Universe changes, so just because I can get mine at the Heavy Shield Complex in Aladna Hill, doesn't mean the game engine hasn't taken out that station in your game.

The encyclopedia updates as the Universe changes.

That list also tells you what ships can use whatever item you look up. 

It also tells you how much that item sells for - Min/Average/Max.

Things that you have not discovered yet will not be listed. So if you haven't been to Aladna Hill, then that complex in Aladna Hill would not be listed - so it doesn't spoil finding the hard stuff for you.

But it's incredibly handy.

I used to alt out of the game every few minutes to try to google where to find things before I discovered that the Encyclopedia tells you that stuff.

Edit to add:

Xadrian is also handy for finding what shipyard to buy factories, because the listing for factories in the Encyclopedia requires the player to know who makes that factory.

So to save yourself the time of looking under each race, you can just look it up in Xadrian.

"Justrolledintotheshop","t5_2tteh","My shop gets these tire business magazines and they have articles about different lawsuits the different manufacturers have. Few years ago had an article about someone used that shit and the tech changing a tire didnt know and was hurt/killed (dont remember exactly) from that stuff in a tire and an open spark ignited it, and causing the tire to explode. (Some of those fuck-a-flat cans are flammable). The family of the guy got a hefty settlement from the customer for not informing the shop that stuff was in the tire. I think the manufacturer of the sealant also put a disclaimer and started including a little tag to put on the tire after the being sued also by the family. 
Personally a hate when I find that crap in a tire, it stinks, throws it out of balance and makes it impossible to balance , it's a mess ,and I've never seen that stuff ever work.

Update: I attempted to find the article with no luck about the one I was referring to. But I did find that in the last couple of years a number of those sealant companies changed their formulas after injuries and lawsuits.","1372637581"

&gt; Essentially, you can replace GameObject with any other class name for a List of that object.

I get that this for loop is running through the list `objects`. What I don't understand is why the `GameObject` `o` has to be `refresh()`'d so many times. With each iteration of the for loop, what exactly changes about `o`? When you call `o.refresh()`, what happens?

I understand that `o` is a `GameObject`:

    public interface GameObject{
        public void refresh();
    }

When you call `GameObject`'s `refresh()`, what happens? Do all objects that have implemented `GameObject` suddenly `refresh()`? Probably not...","1372637581"

"rapecounseling","t5_2rfx0","Because I forgot, as for the detachment from the emotions you feel, the reason is actually very real. After rape and going through counseling, I felt this a lot. My counselor helped me toward this but I found that it actually is very much like two separate people, your conscious self and your subconscious self. You conscious self is the one that feels like the feelings aren't your own and most people only ever see that part because the two aren't disjointed, but your subconscious part is a big decider in your emotions and responses too. This part takes over when you're feeling trauma responses (like it did during the rape) because it is the ""animal"" part of you; the part that kicks in when you're in a flight-or-fight mentality. A lot of rape is your self-preservation part of you trying to protect the conscious part of you from the full brunt of pain; a great effort to save yourself from the full impact of experience everything all at the same time.

Because of this, sometimes people will not even have a bad response to rape and then they will get into a place in life where they feel safe and comfortable and then fall apart. Because, until that point, you had too many other things to worry about, too many other things that were more immediate to your survival, and your body knows that and only doles out what it decides you can handle. Some things will always seep out because, as the above-mentioned book states, your emotions are a tie between your conscious and your subconscious (signs of what you need) and ignoring them does little else but force your body to find another way to tell you, ""Hey! You need to pay attention to this because it's really important to us functioning properly!"" The detachment is a disparity between your consciousness and your body (or subconsciousness.)

**TL;DR** You should access [this book](http://www.resurrectionafterrape.org/)'s free PDF.

Plus, he offers it free and it's got great reviews even on amazon. ","1372637586"

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","The simple answer is DON'T combine multiple ideas/actions into one. 

In all examples I would have changed ""then"" to ""and"" or changed the sentence.

In the second example you are getting in the past tense and that's not good. You want to keep the present tense to maintain to the audience that it is happening now. You're teacher is right in telling you to get the important stuff up front and center. Don't get into the head of the character either, tell us what is heard not what he hears. 

""A loud YELP interrupts Cole. He is unfazed and continues reading. Another YELP. Cole looks up.""

In the third example you have four majorly different things happening in one sentence. That's what you have to edit to get the important out. Short sentences are punchier and convey action. Only put one idea in each sentence and get that idea out in as few words as possible. 

""The Man chuckles. It escalates to AGGRESSIVE LAUGHTER. 
He launches at Cole, PUNCHING him in the chest and face.""

""Cole blocks with his forearm. The Man swings again, and Cole dodges""

That's just a quick change, but remember this isn't a novel. Having lengthy impressive sentences is only going to work against you. Get the audiences as interested as they would be seeing the movie, while reading it. ","1372637601"

&gt;Trucks are big. They are hard to see around. When the average driver (see: idiot) plows into someone else, they cause more damage.

Again, there are different types of trucks. Not all trucks are big and they're really not all that hard to drive for anyone that's competent (i.e. wouldn't have the same amount of trouble driving any other vehicle). Someone driving a truck isn't more or less likely to plow into someone for the sole reason that they're driving a truck. ","1372637604"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Three days, ago, /u/OopsIArted posted a link talking about 2 huskies that only had a couple days left before being euthanized. Naturally curious, I clicked the link and saw they were located in Wichita, KS. 

By this time, it was Thursday morning (D-day was Saturday). I called the Kansas Humane Society and inquired about the dogs. I was redirected to the Wichita Animal Shelter and that's when the fun began. 

I talked to a very helpful man on the phone who said that they did indeed have two huskies. One of the two was in great shape and passed the personality test and was set to be brought to KHS and placed up for adoption the next day. The other dog (named 'Diesel' by the employees) was not so fortunate. He was suffering from hair loss and had failed the personality test, however I was welcome to call KHS with his ID number and inquire further. 

I called the KHS admissions office once more and provided his ID. They pulled up his file and told me that he had 'slight hair loss around his face and on his back' and 'failed the personality test due to making noise after several minutes of being left alone.' *Fair enough. Hardly a reason to put him down, though...* I thought. 

Due to work, we were unable to make the 8-hour trek to pick him up until Tuesday. I asked if it was possible for them to hold him for us until then. ""Well, if you arrive in person, you can place a $50 dollar holding deposit on him which is good until the next business day. However, if his original owners arrive to claim him, the deposit will not be returned to you."" I informed her that we lived several states away and would not be able to make the trip more than once. She then told me that unless we claimed him by 6:30 Friday and picked him up Saturday, they would have no choice but to euthanize him.

We called the animal shelter once more and pleaded our case. Unfortunately, they were unable to hold him either, as he was suffering from extreme kennel stress. They did give us the numbers of several local rescues that may be able to help us by holding him.

We called the first and it realized we had copied the wrong number. We left a message with the third. The second place answered the phone. I won't mention the name of the rescue, but the conversation went something like this:

I began by introducing myself and explaining our situation.
""So, could you not find a dog in your own area or something?""
""We weren't looking for a dog specifically. We just happened to come across this one.""
""Excuse me, where exactly did you hear about this dog?""
I told her.
She then mumbled *""I think SOMEONE spends a bit too much time on the internet.""*
I asked her if they would be able to help us at all. She continued to ask me if I'd ever even met this dog before. The conversation ended with her condescendingly saying that she ""just can't believe that anyone would put this much effort into a dog they didn't even know.""

Being completely emotionally drained at this point, I broke down. My boyfriend called KHS again and was able to talk to a different employee. We decided that it wasn't going to be an option to pick him up Tuesday,  and he agreed to take the night off of work so we could go Saturday. The nice lady was very understanding offered to email the director for us so we could discuss options in the morning. 

Friday came around and we anxiously awaited a call back from the director. The phone finally rang, and we received the wonderful news that 'Diesel' would be joining our pack the next day.

Saturday morning we began our drive and 8 hours later we found ourselves in the lobby of the Kansas Human Society. I swear, I almost exploded while sitting there waiting to meet our new baby. The whole time we filled out paper work, I just wanted to jump out of my seat and go meet our boy. 

Finally the time came. Excited to be out of the kennel finally, he came tearing around the corner (well, as much as he could while on leash) to greet us. He was in a bit* rougher shape than I expected, but that wasn't a problem. I was already in love. Introductions between him and our boys went incredibly well, and they all got along great on the way home.

*Completely grimy, flea covered, potentially mangey, and with a gag-inducing stench

The ride home went fast. We found out that Reginald 'Reggie' Diesel was determined to be a lap dog. I wouldn't have a problem with this, except he smelled and looked like roadkill and kept getting his skin flakes all over me. But hey, that's what love is, right?

First thing that happened when we got home was bath time. I would have scrubbed him more, but at 1 am I have a very low ""OMGOMG LET ME OUT OF HERE THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER"" *shake shake shake* tolerance. The smell was taken care of, but he's still a little dirty. He'll be getting another one soon.

Never did I think I'd like the smell of wet dog so much.","1372637605"

Man brought me on a beautiful romantic awesome Caribbean vacation for 8 days, only to get drunk on day 4, break up with me,  and leave me feeling miserable stranded on vacation. Of course on top of that, we had 3 days of thunderstorms and practically trapped indoors.  As an act of closure we just did a ridiculous amount of fucking and crying. Not sure I'd reccomend it to anyone but I had closure with it. The flight home was silent and awkward. Breakup sex not half bad. I empathize... Ride it out, then good riddance.","1372637608"

* If you were found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.05 (whatever) and you were less than the limit, will they just let you go completely free?    Sorry, our mistake.

* What is the point?  How many suspects refuse the breathalyzer, go to trial and secure a victory and get off completely?  With DUI, the odds are stacked against the suspect.  It is basically the cops word (and the breathalyzer) against the suspect who was probably drinking.

Well you saying ""I posted it in my towns university group"" should og given away you wasn't 14. But it still sounded like a 14 year old pat me on the back post.

&gt; It's not often that I get happy moments of being care-free and not having to worry about someone finding out some thing as heavy as this

You need to get out a bit more.

&gt;  I'm sure we can all relate. We all know how near impossible it is for some thing like that to happen, but it's the sense of knowing what it is and what Society has taught us growing up that sets on the fear.

The same could be said about most of sexuall life. You will find its more your own paranoia not the worlds. Just go and look at the Chastity groups (Not just on Reddit but else where) where they thing the device jumps out of there pants and tells everyone. It doesn't. If someone gets that close to you they are getting rather close anyway. Diapers are just one small thing in the world. Learn to get over it. ""OMG YOU WEAR DIAPERS.... I'm gonna tell everyone..."" ""Well omg you drink more then you should. Maybe I should tell your boss how much you drink...."" (Just for example, everyone has their own vice....) And the thing is with diapers. If someone did bring it up. You could always say its medical, and leave it at that. They will see that you have always been you and well its an non issue.  Which it really is. Its an non issue.

&gt; I do find your initial comment quite contradictory. You're trying to make a point, but by laying me down softly? 

Well tbh, it was more a rant at reddit then you, you were just the straw that broke the camels back. I got sick of looking on there (and other sub reddits) and seeing ""Please pat me on the back posts"" When people should be just fucking getting out there and letting the world know who they are...

&gt; There is only one way I can take this. Harshly, because you don't like the fact that I've posted something positive about my day. 

I'm all glad you had a good day. But do we all need to pat ourselves on the back when AB's/DL's have a good day? Today I had a good day because I mowed the lawn in a set of dungarees, t shirt and I had a diaper underneath. Do I need a pat on the back? Nope. Because I would of done it anyway. I'm glad you are coming to terms with who you are. But I am sick of clapping every time one is open about who they are. You need to be you. and fuck what anyone else thinks (Including us on reddit, /r/abdl, whatever). You will make friends in whatever you do, There are plenty of people out there for you. The ""14 year old"" was used as an example of how simplistic it can come across. I don't give a flying fuck about you. I really don't but ""AS A GROUP"" the back slapping makes us come across that we are more freaks than we are.

&gt; I'm not going to diminish my happiness, which has lately been in short supply because you don't want to hear a ""supposed"" trend going down in sub-reddit.

I'm not asking you too. But to you really feel the need to to get that happiness from reddit? shouldn't you be sharing that happiness with others in your life. Not some 1 and 0's on the net? (although this is an argument against reddit as a whole. and again comes back to me saying it wasn't you I was targeting but reddit as a whole, the whole pat me on the back for being me thing...). You should be happy to live your life. but your still putting it down other peoples necks as if you were depressed with your life....#

&gt; I'm not going to disregard this attempt, so I do thank you for your effort.
I value pure honesty to the point where it's almost crushing than for someone to sugar coat their true thoughts and feelings. It feels unnatural.

You value pure honesty. Well here it is. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it as a personal attack on you, but more as an attack on this sub and reddit as a whole. Congratulation posts come off as a achivement. There are plenty of people out there who are not just accepting of our way of life but who are understanding of people different ways of being. So while they have never thought about it themselves they are open minded enough to atleast give it a try. But that could be said about anything personal in a relationship. 

You see, I see us as putting ourselves in a box. We are cutting ourselves off from everyone else. We are making ourselves the freaks. WHEN WE SHOULDN'T (and again this inst you, but you just happened to walk in the line of fire while I was thinking it).

So this is why I laid it out there and said what I feel. Back Patting ourselves does more harm than good. We need to think that we are just as normal as every other freak on the planet....

&gt; I appreciate what you're trying to say and do for me, but can't help but feel you're a bit of an ass for it.

No one ever said I had to be a nice guy when I signed up to the net.  I am a bit of a dick. But you know what? At time the net needs a dick to point out that there is a world around them that doesn't give a fuck who or what they am as long as they get on with it like everyone else does.","1372637617"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; It appears that quite a few American Redditors will defend the actions of its government against criticism no matter how wrong they may be.

And quite a few Redditors want to criticize the US in isolation in order maintain their simplistic world view in which the US is the only bad guy, even if their own countries are doing exactly what the US is doing.

&gt; When news breaks about Germany's operations, we can talk about it then, but until then this behaviour is just absolutely pathetic.

The fact that the US is the only country getting criticized is pathetic. It shows you how anti-Americanism is based on hypocrisy and double-standards.

The news HAS broke on Germany's spying, years ago. Germany spies both on its own people and on foreign countries they are allied with:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/4548753/Britain-under-attack-from-20-foreign-spy-agencies-including-France-and-Germany.html

It's just that most people, like you, don't give a shit unless it's the US doing it. You have an insatiable urge to pretend that negative traits that exist elsewhere are exclusive or particular to the US. You have an addiction to US-bashing.

What's funny is that all you're doing is demonstrating your hypocrisy and/or ignorance of the whole situation and then pretending like you have some sort of high ground over the people who are LOGICALLY pointing out that other countries are doing what the US is doing.

"funny","t5_2qh33","It may be different in NC, but in NY the garages don't make any money on state inspections - the price is set by the state ($10 for safety, $27 for emissions on OBDII cars, $17 for emissions on OBDI cars), and all the money gets forwarded to the DMV.

It's also not a waste of time.  You'd be amazed how many people come in completely unaware that their tires are balder than Patrick Stewart and have bubbles in them that make seltzer water jealous, or that their brakes are one attempted emergency stop away from failing completely, or that there's a leak in their fuel line that could potentially start a fire (we actually once had a customer argue with us, claiming that we should have passed his car anyway despite the gas leak).  Also how many people drive around with the check engine light on 363 days a year thinking it's just fine (the 364th and 365th day being the day that they get the code to clear and the day they get their re-inspection).  Yes, a CEL *could* mean something stupid like your gas cap not being on tight, but it could also mean something like your catalytic converter is about to shit the bed.  That's the problem with an idiot light like that (although it only takes a free app and a $20 i-Device attachment to be able to read OBD codes yourself.)

Inspection of brand-new cars is largely ceremonial (although they also serve as a double-check to make sure that you're not getting a fucked up car straight out of the showroom), and generally there aren't many minor problems for year-old cars.  But it's only 10 dollars and 10 minutes and it's better to play it safe when it comes to a 2-ton flammable metal machine.","1372637626"

I actually have my eye on Reggie Bush as well, but more as a mid 3rd to early 4th type guy.  Picking him where you're considering is a bit of a reach and I'd feel better about Gore or Murray, personally.  

Another option you might want to consider is going WR1/WR2, grabbing Thomas and then someone like Fitz/Andre Johnson/Roddy White.  It's a bigger gamble, but your WR1&amp;2 will be a strength not many other teams have and then you can aim for a guy like Lamar Miller or one of the hot rookies near the end of the 4th.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; (4) I would expand these protections to the internet, cloud storage, phone, cars etc and ensure to add a clause to take care future technology. Also, I would ban secret courts and agencies from writing their own warrants.

Does the government not have legitimate interests in keeping some state secrets? Intelligence operations overseas still need oversight and that isn't something that can really work in the public eye. I'm interested in how you seek to resolve this.

&gt;I would remove ""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."" and go as far as banning eminent domain done by states. If you wish to help the public you can choose to sell / give the property.

Should the government be forced to reroute public works projects at the cost of millions to the public simply because a small section of land is refused to be sold? I understand your concerns but in many areas of the country infrastructure simply can not be built without relying on eminent domain. Wouldn't a better solution be to mandate better payouts in the case of eminent domain rather than simply remove it as a tool from the government? I'm interested in your thoughts. 

&gt;(7) Remove the $20 minimum and make the trial by jury always occur.

Why? Some cases simply don't need to be decided by a jury. It's time consuming and costly to both the state and to the jury members. I understand making a jury trial always an option but don't see why we need to have it required. 

&gt;(13) I would expand this to include a ban on the draft. Also, I would probably ban jury duty. (volunteers and government employees would be on juries). The government should not be forcing us to do involuntary servitude.

Should the government not be able to rise an army in times of extreme circumstances? Obviously this is not something that will occur in any capacity in the near future but it seems like a mistake to remove it all together. When emergencies strike there often is not enough time to raise an all volunteer army. 

I also don't think you've really thought out on a practical level your opinion on juries. In Amendment 7 you've required all trials to have a jury yet you've gone ahead in this amendment and banned the very system that allows juries to even be filled. How can you guarantee that there will be enough jurors to try cases without a significant backlog? Another issue I see is that all volunteer juries most likely wont be able to provide a representative example of the public and finding unbiased jurors in certain cases will be quite difficult. Look at the trouble the government had staffing the Zimmerman trial. 

Should the public not be expected to serve the country they live in in any capacity? I understand you oppose involuntary servitude to the government but it seems to me that we have to make these concessions on a practical level if we wish to have a functioning legal system. 

&gt;(20) Rather than having a set date Jan 20th and Jan 3rd for people to go into office, I would make it 15 days after the last state finishes their election of representatives / senators they would take office and 30 days after the last state finishes their election the president would take office. Also, I would remove section 2. We don't have the issue of congress not doing enough.

Is there not a practical consideration as to why having specific dates may be a useful thing? Having set dates for these things to happen allows planning to happen well in advance and for budgets to be set. I don't see how forcing a quicker transition helps anything. Just curious as to why you have an issue with this particular section?

Why the hate on section 2? I think its worth requiring our representatives meet at least once. They may not now but who knows, maybe someday they just slack off all the time. Granted its redundant now but I don't see why we should seek to eliminate all redundancy from our laws. 

&gt;(27) I would like to do something based on the average salary of the US to decide on how much they make. Maybe average salary times 2 or 3. They don't need too much money since they get healthcare, pension, millions for extra costs, they get refunded on airfare, etc. They should be there to serve the people rather than make money.

I think there is an argument to be made that having our elected officials be financially well off does reduce corruption. If you can support yourself you are far less likely to engage in corruption. Nobody goes into politics for the money, they go in for the power. Most elected officials could make far more money outside of political office.

&gt;any and all reasoning behind the parts that you have currently selected?

**CPU:** The reviews said it was a great processor and that it completes any task that somebody would need. The price is great too.

**Motherboard:** I honestly just picked this because it has decent reviews but I am very open to changes. 

**Memory:** Fast performing ram and 8gb to meet today's standard.  

**Storage:** My funds are pretty tight so I picked the most affordable costing hard drive.

**Video Card:** I chose this card because it handles graphic intensive games fairly well.  The reviews say it can run BF3 on ultra at 60 fps.  I also decided to get it since it is on sale.  I'm open to changes though.

**Power Supply:** I am probably going to change this because I only chose it since it is modular and has a high wattage for a very low price.  I'm not sure what else to get though.

Anyone who spends some time in this sub without the inclination to outright dismiss it knows that each gender has their own problems. Most these problems listed here aren't even gendered, or anything more than anecdotes.

""What if all women were the only ones required to fight, suffer and die in war? 

What if because you were a woman you would lose your financial aid and the opportunity at education because you didn't believe in war? 

What if your attractiveness was based off how competitive you are and your subsequent earning and status potential? Status which is often earned through overworking, stress, and not taking the time to enjoy your life. 

What if because you were a woman your friends were more likely to end their own lives?

What if because you were a woman you'd have to work in a low-status, dangerous but essential job because similar status men would rather live off your taxes? 

What if because you were a woman your friends were constantly being assaulted and subjected to criminal violence and yet no one cared? 

What if because you were a woman, a man could put you in jail on word alone? 

What if because you were a woman society would not take your health as seriously, even if you're far more likely to die because of it? 

What if because you were a woman, your quality of life would be measurably lower and you were going to die years sooner? 

What if because you were a woman, you were always perceived as the aggressor when a man chooses to attack you and you defend yourself? 

What if because you were a woman you'd have no reproductive rights, because society has decided that consent to a short sexual encounter is the same as consenting to fatherhood and two decades of financial responsibility?

What if because you were a woman all your problems were dismissed as your own fault, because men refuse to take responsibility for society and would rather blame it on your gender due to the very tiny minority of women in power, women who don't experience the same kind of hardship?","1372637644"

I've found that if I flex my thigh and calf muscles when I feel a faint coming on, it helps prevent it. I forget where I heard it, but supposedly blood can pool in your legs and cause a blood pressure drop. Clenching the leg muscles prevents it from pooling up as much, and keeps your blood pressure from dropping. Your mileage may vary, of course, but it seems to help me.","1372637650"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","You should input your entire rare collection into a site like deckbox.org which will give you a rough estimate of what your collection is worth. The value it'll give you is the median price from tcgplayer.com which is the average price with the outliers thrown out. 

Of course there's no way to differentiate the final price difference between NM and HP cards, which affect the price quite a bit especially for expensive cards, or foils. You should also take the time to input any commons and uncommons that see heavy play in eternal formats, since a lot of uncommons can be priced anywhere from 0.50 to $10 if they see heavy play in legacy or modern. If you get all your cards inputted, the final price you get you should expect offers for about 60-70% of that for the whole collection. No one will offer you full retail value for your cards so be aware of that.

Another way to evaluate your collection is to go on a site like starcity (http://sales.starcitygames.com/buylist/) and check out their buylists. If you have a rare that isn't on a buylist for a set then it's a bulk rare and you can expect to not get more than $0.10-0.20 per each bulk rare. Most collectors will offer you buylist prices for your stuff if you're going to sell your collection whole. 

If you're looking to get the best return then you should put in the time and effort to sell your more valuable cards individually or as a playset on ebay. You'll get hit with a lot of fees, but you'll get the best return that way.","1372637651"

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","The way to deal with straight guys is very simple, be absolutely clear that you're not interested. You can try to do it as politely and as kindly as you're able to, but the most important part is to make it very clear from the beginning that they should move on.

Keep in mind that the dating scene for a lot of guys mostly about repetition; keep trying often enough and someone will eventually say yes. So for many guys, if they get any sense that they might have a shot they will keep trying. In that case you have to shut them down as often as it takes for them to get the message. And if they think you're a bitch because of it, well who the fuck cares? Once it's obvious you're not interested, them being persistent is purely a dick move. So there's no reason to be polite to them at this point.

I'll let you in on a little secret. The reason guys can act like such assholes and get away with it is because for the most part we don't care what other people at the bar think of us. So if some random jerk who you have no interest in whatsoever thinks you're a bitch why should that matter to you at all? Cause I can pretty much guarantee you that after he leaves you'll only be in his thoughts for as long as it takes for him to find the next girl to flirt with.

Now let me be clear, though, not all guys will be like that. If a guy says hi or compliments you it does not mean he's expecting sex all of a sudden. There are plenty of dudes who will be perfectly happy keeping it friendly. Of course those same guys will also leave you alone and move on as soon as you make it clear you're not interested. And more importantly won't think any less of you for it.","1372637654"

"religion","t5_2qh39","The ""attempted"" part is worse than ""re-construction"", though ""revival"" is still better, given the limitations you've mentioned (though there's rather more than ""scraps"". Not as much as the Egyptians, not as little as the Celts.)

&gt; It's not as if there is an unbroken lineage of this belief system.

They'd be the first to say that. Ditto for any adherent of a similar religion. (I doubt there's anything like ""My dead grandma Fatimah initiated me into the hidden cult of Athirat, guise!"" ) 

Between that, and having to use whatever information has remained, this is why ""revival"" is preferred. 

""Reconstruction"" tends to have connotations of making something exactly the same as before, which is not the case, as doing so would not be feasible, and in some cases, not desirable. 

 In addition to being terminally naive about changes in religions over time,this leads to some people going ""DURR HURR YOU GUISE DON'T SACRIFICE OXEN IN HUEG TEMPLES UR JUST PLAY ACTING LOLOLOLOL HURR DURR""  Here's an [example](http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2007/01/paganism_withou.html) from a classicist(!) concerning modern Greek Hellenists. Because they think it can only be about practicing exactly as people did thousands of years ago. Even uninterrupted religions are not practiced today as they were hundreds or thousands of years ago.

""Neopagan"" on the other hand does not have an excuse  especially given that a good number of Pagans these days simply take ""Pagan"" to mean whatever they want it to mean, and balk at the merest suggestion that words should have meanings. That is another subject entirely, though.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","There are 2 important ""damage"" numbers on a melee weapon, Physical Damage and Auto-attack. For the sake of clarity, let's just rename Physical Damage as Weapon Damage (WD) and Auto-Attack Damage as (AAD). 

You almost figured it out, but the important concept to notice is that auto-attack has a potency that is relative to a weapon's AAD stat. If you consider the Mogfork for example:

40.45 AAD

41 WD

The actual ""potency"" of your auto-attack is going to be (40.45/41) * 100. So for the Mogfork, it is 98.67 potency. This number becomes important in the damage formula as the overall ratio of damage dealt. The reason this is true is because potency is a strict external scaling modifier. That means that a 200 potency ability will do exactly 2x the damage of a 100 potency ability. A 300 potency ability will do exactly 3x the damage of a 100 potency ability.

So let's consider 2 attacks, auto-attack and a 100 pot WS

* 100 pot WS does 100 points of damage on average.
 
* Auto-attack with Mogfork will do 98.67 points of damage on average.

Of course there aren't decimals so there is rounding error. Let's consider another example with the Gae Bolg.

* 100 Pot WS does 100 points of damage on average
 
* Auto-attack does (45.76/44) * 100 or 104 points of damage on average.

The AAD stat is a ratio determinant to how powerful auto-attack will be. Simply take the AAD/WD ratio and use it as a final damage ratio. You could also do what you did with [(delay/3)]. You will get the same ratio. 

As for Garuda weapons, I'm not sure. Skill speed does seem underwhelming. Either the Ifrit Weapons will provide more true damage, or the Mog Weapons will help you hit the Accuracy cap and raise your crit chance. DPS, in my testing, does not seem to play a distinct role, other than its intrinsic formula relationship with Delay and AAD. ","1372637655"

They get a bad rap like rotweillers, dobermen and german shepherds used to get but it is all how they are raised. People just like to try and spread fear and in turn ignorance, which makes it so that the shelters are overflowing with pits who can't find a home because they are thought to be monsters. It's like generalizing all humans and saying we are bred for evil because there are a few bad people in the bunch. No. it depends on the person and it depends on the dog.

As for tethering two year old dogs to you...whatever you think makes the most sense. You could use stretchy leashes to absorb some of the shocks.  Ruff wear makes some pretty expensive ones, but I'm sure you could find an off brand for cheaper. Like these: http://www.ruffwear.com/The-Roamer-Leash-trade_5?sc=2&amp;category=15   
  
Alternatively, you could set up tethers or a pen in each room, and put the pups in whichever room you happen to be in. They won't be right at your side, but at least they'll be close enough for you to watch.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","I'm not a high elo player, but I main support. Janna is the great equalizer for lane and team fights. Here is a little 101 on Janna. This is just the basics, I'm sure higher elo players can lend more.    
Her whirlwinds - you can reactivate the skill to launch the tornados early. This is important if you see you're being chased. Otherwise, the best use of these are to block enemies from getting cs. If you see one of your minions is about to die, quickly fire the tornado at the adc. You can also use them to harass from an unwarded bush. Place the whirlwind in the bush targeted in the area you think the enemy will be, then exit bush and wait. If you see a chance to land it, activate it early.    
Her slow/movement passive - This is great to pick up to allow you greater and faster positioning in lane. This allows you to set up clutch saves by getting into position to set up disengage with a whirlwind or ult.    
Her shield - This serves many purposes. Janna is great at defending towers because she can shield them and then use tornados to knock up enemies and clear minions. Her shield is also great for mitigating harass. But possibly the best use of her shield is to boost an allies damage. Use it on your adc in trades or when your jungler comes in to gank. Use it to help your adc push your lane.    
Her ult - One of the most frustrating ults in the game (for opposing teams). If your team wasn't prepared for a hard initiate or the fight isn't going the way you want, your ult resets the fight and allows your team the chance to fight another day. Her ult is best used for the reset rather than the heal.    
I think what you were noticing is that most aren't prepared for you to use her ult as a heal. It certainly has that function, but the skill is way too beneficial to risk having it on CD when a gank or hard initiate happens. So many are not prepared to see it used for that purpose. If someone is low on health and has no sustain, then the best thing for them to do is to go back to base. Blowing the CD on your ult so that one of your players can stay on the map for 10 more seconds is a bit of a waste.    
A well played Janna will neutralize a kill lane. Thresh/Draven? No problem, you set up the disengage and the adcs continue to farm. Janna's only fault is that she doesn't secure a lot of kills early, but she is great at not losing lane. Use her abilities to bully. If you learn her well enough, you can keep your adc safe for most of the match, allowing them to maximize CS.    
TL;DR - use her tornados and ult for disengages. And as Janna, you're not going to be flashy. You're just going to save your adc often and help them out farm the opponent.","1372637666"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got a friend a job at a print lab I was working at. We both had to mix custom colors of ink. It's easy enough work, you could watch/listen to music/videos while doing it as long as you paid attention to how much of each color you put in. Some mixes required you to put in .1g of a fast-moving color. 

I was the best person working there at the time, so I could make a can in about 3-5 minutes. This guy would spend the entire shift (6-8 hours) making 20, so his average time was about 20+ minutes a can. Newbies have shitty time, but he was there for almost a year and his times were still shit.

He was constantly on /r/leagueoflegends, so much so that Chrome showed that he was on it more than the site we used to track our orders and display color formulas. He would be constantly texting his girlfriend or watching How I Met Your Mother on Netflix. He was full-on not doing any work watching his phone watching, not just listening while doing his work.

The print lab had to downgrade because we were having less work to do and our boss hired too many people. I was let go because I was being paid 50 more cents an hour than everyone else. This guy was kept on because he knew MySQL and PHP and could ""fix"" the database (though our boss never had him do it).

Another guy who had the same skills got laid off, too, and he was a faster mixer.","1372637670"

If I'm being critical I would say it is a bit wordy, there are a lot of words which seem to be serving the same purpose. Also as you have it you are actually inviting them twice (""you are invited"" and then ""please join them""). I know you have done this to include the 'tie the knot' bit, but maybe you could condense it so there is only one actual invitation, leaving less words on the invite, making it easier to read and more visually appealing. In my opinion. 

You could have the tie the knot bit as 

"".. invited to the wedding of _ &amp; _ 

As they tie the knot

on Saturday....""

though that does seem like a run on sentence.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Well really, the armies of the late 17th century and the armies of the 18th century were very similar. The pike and shot formations that you mentioned were starting to fall out of favour even in the Thirty Years War. 

One reason for the shift away from mixed formations of pike and musket armed infantry was the increasing prevalence of the bayonet, which could essentially turn a musketman into a pikeman with relative ease. Replacing pikemen with musketmen could thus double the firepower of any given unit without, theoretically, sacrificing their strength on the charge or when defending against cavalry.

Early bayonets were of the ""plug"" type, which meant they had to be inserted into the barrel of the musket to be used. In combat situations this essentially precluded the subsequent firing of the musket, so an order to fix bayonets would have to be given very carefully. By the end of the 17th century the socket bayonet became more reliable, and most European armies had adopted it by the early 18th. The socket configuration allowed the musket to be fired and reloaded while the bayonet was affixed, finally eliminating any benefit from having dedicated pikemen in an infantry formation. Around the turn of the century the flintlock also started to replace the matchlock as the standard mechanism on European muskets, which made them more reliable and increased their rate of fire.

The increased use of mobile battlefield artillery also started to shift the character of battles in the 17th century. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden is famous for putting mobile artillery to its first truly effective use at the Battle of Breitenfeld during the Thirty Years War, and over the next few decades this became a fairly common practice. Lighter guns, usually towed by teams of horses, could be moved relatively quickly into new positions on the battlefield. In conjunction with heavier, more static pieces these guns could help support an advance or cover a new defensive position after a retreat, and tactics had to adjust accordingly.

One result of these developments was that battles became, for a time, less decisive. It became exceedingly difficult for one army to destroy another on the field, even with the advantage of numbers, position and firepower. Take for example the battle of Ramillies during the War of Spanish Succession. The allied English-Dutch army and their French enemies each had about 60,000 men. The allies took fewer than 4,000 casualties, while the French took nearly 20,000 and were forced to retreat. But the bulk of their army survived to fight another day.

At the Battle of Blenheim in 1704, the Duke of Marlborough crushed the French army under Tallard. Out of nearly 60,000 men, the French lost more than 30,000 killed, wounded or captured. But the rest escaped, and the English and their allies lost over 12,000 men out of 50,000. Even outright victories such as this were costly for the victors.

This trend toward relative tactical indecisiveness was matched by a strategic trend toward caution among Western European armies. When even a crushing defeat left half one's army intact, capitalizing on tactical victories became increasingly difficult. That, combined with the increasing prevalence of strong fortifications made advancing deep into enemy territory a very dangerous proposition. While commanders like Prince Eugene of Savoy and Marlborough argued consistently for bolder offensives, it was a risk their governments were unwilling to take. 

As for good books covering the topic, I can recommend *The Wars of Louis XIV* by John A. Lynn as a good general survey of those conflicts. In many ways they embody the transition you're interested in, and he does a good job of giving background, and covering the political side of the wars as well as tactics and strategy.","1372637675"

* i5 and 8GB of RAM not ideal for 3D modeling, but you did say it was occasional, so hopefully won't be an issue. Added the CPU cooler as it's a small case and should help make sure the CPU stays cool at all times

* Case itself is smaller than you one you posted. One thing a few reviews mention is the bottom legs do make the case susceptible to bumps. They suggest just removing the bottom legs and throwing on some cheap rubber feet from a hardware store. Other than that it's a great case. Added 2 fans to help with airflow, 1 for the front intake and 1 for the top exhaust. 

* 128GB SSD for your OS and some applications, 2TB of storage.

* 7850 GPU, good bang for your buck.

* Reliable fully modular PSU, which is great for a small case to manage cables. ","1372637677"

You can also queue for dungeons at the same time (as long as you queue for both before you get into a raid group) so you can do something different on occasion.  Past that, pre-50 instant adventures are pretty awesome experience wise.

http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/18/00.031.027.000..HTM

Either it's a crime or it isn't. Either the opinion of CPS is that it's child exploitation or it isn't.

&gt;And by ""gain access"" what happened was the reporter attended a party she was invited to where a young transguy injected himself then used a breast pump on himself. The reporter asked if she could look and he turned around and showed her. What's the crime?

See above.

&gt;I have a huge issue with trying to censor discussion of a trans minor's junk.

And I have a huge issue with being prosecuted for breaking the law. 

&gt;Granted, her article was not the right place for talking about junk. It was more on the voyeuristic side. But still harmless IMHO. 

Paste into a reply any other newspaper article in which a reporter talks a kid into showing them their genitalia. Medical journals where parents give consent doesn't count. You're talking about a vulnerable 15 year old who making a choice that may well kill him just like it went on to kill others.

Please, prove to me that you're cont using a double standard.  

&gt; I don't think the article was offensive at all aside from the bit.

Then we have different opinions on what constitutes an offense. Criminal sex crimes are offensive to me. 

&gt;It looks to me like the activist here has something personal against the author because she's known as a not-so-trans-family radical feminist.

Strawman and equivocation. 

Is it criminal? Yes or no? Again, here's the law for reference:

http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/18/00.031.027.000..HTM

"Baking","t5_2qx1h","I've had quite a few disasters in my life with baking...

The first huge blunder was the first layer cake I tried to make when I was about 15. Before that I had just done like rectangular box cakes that you would just cut in the pan and take out slices...so I did NOT properly prepare the round cake pans for actually removing the cakes. Three beautiful strawberry cake layers that absolutely stuck and crumbled when I tried to get them out of the pan.

The second big mistake was misreading the amount of salt that went into some homemade granola bars I was making. I guess I did not have the sense back then to think that like a cup of salt was *kind of* a lot. They tasted so awful that the birds wouldn't even touch the scraps. Such a shame too because it ended up being an EXPENSIVE recipe to mess up since it had a lot of expensive ""all natural"" ""organic"" grain type things in it. 

I've also ruined A LOT of eggs trying to whip egg whites for meringues when I was first attempting to bake things other than box mixes. 

Don't feel bad about making mistakes. We've all had cheesecakes that ended up with craters of doom down the middle, things that tasted awful because we forgot an essential ingredient, or experiments that went horribly, horribly wrong. With cooking and baking (and a lot of other things really) it takes time to build up instinct and techniques.  ","1372637693"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","AppleTV usually uses the iPhone chip from the previous year. The current one uses a die-shrunk version of the A5 chip, which is what comes in the iPhone 4S. Though it's not unlikely that they could put a die shrunk A6X (which is what's in the current retina iPad) in the next gen Apple TV, bump up the price a little to $150, and let it run apps from the App Store (unlike their current method of baking in apps) which would include some decent games. 

To lend credibility to this theory (and go off on a tangent), note that the retina iPad already drives a higher resolution screen (2048x1536) with decent graphics, so at 1080p graphics would in fact improve not insignificantly over those of the current iPad. Also, they sell the 16 GB retina iPad at 30-40% margins for $500. So let's say they produce that iPad for $330. Once you strip out the battery, the retina screen, the proximity/light sensors, remove both cameras, the impact resistant glass, the lightning connector, some of that storage, use an older chipset, ditch the unibody aluminum chassis, and stop engineering for mobility, you can get the price down significantly. They could conceivably sell that device at $150 and still make their usual margins. Or they could keep the price at $100 and hope that their cut from the App Store and the iTunes Store gets them back to their usual margins (this is decidedly less Apple-like though). It's too early to tell though, and this all is probably just the fever dreams of an optimistic Apple fan. 

Also, parentheses everywhere! Hope that didn't bother you too much. ","1372637695"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","False. Guns do not cause violence, people do. By your logic fists start fights. Guns, alcohol, knives, etc are all inanimate objects and cannot cause violence. Alcohol doesn't cause alcoholism, abusive behaviors cause alcoholism. If alcohol caused alcoholism then every person that drinks would become an alcoholic. If guns didn't exist there would be no gun violence, but it would have no affect on violence itself. I don't know about you, but I could care less about what type of weapon is used to kill someone I care about. Dead is dead. If guns didn't exist criminals would just move to the next most effective killing method. 

TL;DR Violence is caused by a conscious decision to commit evil, not inanimate objects. The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. ","1372637695"

A dancer who testified on Jackson's behalf in the last trial has since admitted that he was molested by MJ. Either there's this extremely vast conspiracy to destroy that man's reputation or he really is a molester. He built his own indoor/outdoor amusement park to draw children in, similar to what Sandusy did with the charity that he ran.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","&gt;why doesn't it make it a better exercise?  

Because you have to use less weight, so you get proportionately less stimulus from the exercise.  

Take a hypothetical lifter who is capable of a 300lb bench press with arch and leg drive, etc. If he goes flat backed on the bench with soft legs, he can now only move 250lbs. That makes it more difficult for him to get a good training stimulus out of his bench.  

If the goal is muscular growth and CNS adaptation, you want to use the exercise variation that has *more* muscle groups involved. Benching with no legs and back to get a better pec contration is inane. Imagine trying to overhead press while slouching, because it's harder to move an equal amount of weight that way.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The strength of S2 Mundo was his ability to quickly clear camps without needing a blue (only Shyv, Lee, and Mundo could do this) allowing for MASSIVE counter jungling.  In S3 the small monsters have been nerfed to hell so AOE is not as important, and several new junglers have been released that do the same thing but better (see: Zac).  

Also counter jungling up until 3.8 was a total waste of time.  You could take 3 of the 4 early buffs and still end up on even levels.  In S2 if you lost a buff, you were in A LOT of trouble.  It's better now in 3.8 but there is much better counter junglers (Nunu).  

Basically most of Mundo's strengths are no longer unique, and his skillset  is made for a version of the jungle that's not relevant anymore.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","That is absolutely not the main symptom of being a sociopath. Sociopath generally refers to Antisocial Personality Disorder, which is defined as: 

&gt;The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV-TR), defines ASPD (in Axis II Cluster B) as:

&gt;A) There is a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three or more of the following:

&gt;* failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;
* deception, as indicated by repeatedly lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure;
* impulsiveness or failure to plan ahead;
* irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults;
* reckless disregard for safety of self or others;
* consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations;
* lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another;

&gt;B) The individual is at least age 18 years.

&gt; C) There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years.

&gt;D) The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or a manic episode.

Really the only thing that the two possibly share is the deception of others for personal gain.

If you break it down further into the common subtypes, self-loathing is actually one of the defining features. Narcissism is commonly intertwined with ASPD/sociopathic tendencies, but by no mean is one required for the other to exist. ","1372637712"

Others: for future reference, call your local hospital and ask to be put through to the CAT team.  If that CAT team is available, they'll talk to you, otherwise (and most likely) you'll be put through to the Mental Health Line service who'll take your details and give you advice.

In your instance, even after saying No, you'd have been asked further questions - how anxious are you feeling?  Are you thinking about harming yourself or others?  Are there any children in the house? etc and very likely you'd have been encouraged to go to your hospital's ED, and your details and call notes passed from the mental health line to the CAT team.  Then it's just a matter of waiting for the CAT team (can be several hours).  In some areas the CAT team will even do house calls.

If you'd said that yes, you were planning to commit suicide in the next 12 hours, you'd probably be asked how you were going to do it.  They're looking for key words here to gauge whether or not to involve the Police.  Even if you say ""first I'm going to make a sandwich and then cut it in half with a knife"", that's enough.  ""Knife"" = cops.  And an Ambulance is on the way too.

I believe in Del Bosque however, you do not win the World Cup and European Championship by chance. Our defense just couldn't handle Brazil's pace and while I do think Brazil got lucky on some chances, they created way too many to not eventually score. I hope he [Del Bosque] can figure this out and I hope David Villa regains his goal-scoring form because we surely need it.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt; All copies of laws are just translations, and only the original English copies will stand in court.

This doesn't make sense, my friend. A law is a law, no matter what language it was published in.

&gt;I have never seen any evidence for your framer's argument, although I do hear it a lot. It's more likely that the framer's did not feel the need to state the obvious, because that's generally how law works in a common law system. This is the same for many common law countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia.

We don't have a common law system here--we have civil law. Our judges don't write law, although how they interpret any particular law will stand until a higher court changes it, or the law is rewritten. But the fact that we have representatives who write the legal code is a major difference. 

This idea that some things are so obvious they don't have to be written--this is kind of a ridiculous idea. We have a Supreme Court *because* you can't just assume what the framers meant. (And you're using that apostrophe incorrectly, by the way. English is my second language, but I don't mind pointing that out to you.)

Don't do ""Jackass"" type stunts.   If you enjoy more dangerous sports, do them with as much safety equipment as you can.  Always wear a helmet when on a motorcycle, bicycle, or horse.

Use caution around drugs &amp; alcohol.   Don't mix recreational drugs.   Be *really* careful if you're on any sort of depressants (such as a narcotic) and you are thinking of having a few drinks.   Drug ODs can sent you to the ER, do permanent organ damage, or in some cases kill you.  

Use caution when having sex: make sure the condom is applied properly and don't take unnecessary risks.  AIDS isn't on the news as much any more, but it's still a big problem.   Hepatitis can also do some serious damage to you.   Just because a partner says they're clean doesn't mean they are.  Many people get infected with something and may have no idea for a long time. 


And then for the typical health advice:
Eat real food, not the processed crap.   Now is a great time in your life to learn how to cook from scratch, if you haven't already.   Lots of whole grains, fruits, nuts, veggies.  If you're eating right, you shouldn't need lots of vitamins. 

Limit your saturated fat intake... or cut it out completely.  Vegetarians do statistically [live longer](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324423904578523190441042514.html) than the general public.   I've been veg for 20 yrs and have 'ideal' cholesterol and blood pressure, despite my admittedly less active lifestyle.

Do NOT smoke.   Not even a few a day.   Just don't start; it's not worth it.  

Drink alcohol in moderation and try not to binge drink.

Be active.  Try out different sports or activities and do things you love.  You don't need to be a championship winner... it's just about getting off the sofa and doing things as many days a week as possible.

Control your stress.   It may be you have to change your mindset about some things.  Some things (or people) just aren't worth it.   Maybe try meditation.   

Sunscreen isn't a bad idea.  It may not be an issue now but as time goes on, be aware of changes in moles.  Show anything funny to your doc and/or to a dermatologist.  

Be EDUCATED about your health.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor questions, get a 2nd opinion, or do your own research.   Getting an exam every year or so isn't a bad idea.   Find a doctor you really like &amp; trust.  ","1372637725"

Physics^##, but do materials/condensed matter experiment and then pay attention to engineering principles.  You will have the best of each in this case.

If you do thin films, semi conductor physics of any kind, or NMR, lots of companies will want to kiss you as they offer you jobs AS LONG as you know how to *build the machines*.

I'd say the same goes for any experimental technique if you focus on automation, programming, and engineering the electronics.  Do not pick up an apparatus that costs 5.8 Million.  Make your own.  If you get involved in that weird, esoteric type of experimental physics, where the guys are building the shit - you will be an engineer as well, by the end of it.

Embracing the alternative means that we espouse the idea that the government knows better than you do how you should run your life. That seems distasteful to me.

If you're going to say, that as humans, we have a right to die if we choose to, unless you're depressed of course, in which case, fuck you.

Sure you can see them from all over town, but on the mall you can get so close you can feel your chest compress when they go off.  Get there a little early (not too early, 1.5-2 hours before is plenty, bring a frisbee or cards) and set up near the Washington Monument.  When you leave, walk one or two metro stops AWAY from the direction you want to go.  Then you can get on the train (which will be nearly empty), grab a seat, and watch comfortably as the train gets totally jammed at the next station. It's a real experience.","1372637739"

NIPPON/HAND PAINTED NIPPON ERA

The McKinley Tariff, which took effect March 1,1891, required that all imported goods be stamped in English with their country of origin. At the time, ""NIPPON"" was considered to be an acceptable name for Japan, so most Japanese ceramics of this period were backstamed ""NIPPON"" or ""HAND PAINTED NIPPON."" often with a company logo as well. However, not all were stamped that way. There were still unmarked pieces, and pieces stamped ""JAPAN"" as well.  NIPPON pieces are priced higher than MADE IN JAPAN and are eagerly sought by collectors."" [Source](http://www.ebay.com/gds/History-of-Made-in-Japan-Ceramics/10000000004613626/g.html) Now clearly I don't know how accurate or trustworthy that source is, but I quite literally googled ""Nippon"" and that was the top result.

True, the WBC and the guys running said restaurant don't give a shit about what Reddit thinks. But they don't have to. I'm going to guess that most of the people who have taken the time to read and/or comment on this post, if and when confronted by a situation similar to the OP, are going to behave with a little more tolerance and civility than they might have yesterday. Some might find the courage/incentive to speak up for others, or maybe explain to a slightly less-evolved friend or family member that it's just not okay to say this kind of shit. These small moments do have a ripple effect. Idiots are always going to be idiots, but most people aren't idiots -- most of us (and by ""us"" I mean the world beyond Reddit) like to think of ourselves as people who are doing the right thing, who are on the right side of history.

I think had Italy attacked more they could have had a similar result, but I also believe that a side with more energy, better defending etc would do well against Brazil. Germany, Italy and indeed England cannot be counted out of this 2014 world cup because it's one thing to beat this Spanish side and another thing to be the best team in the world.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Completely relaxed compared to other states where it's not technically ""legal"". We have it decriminalized, which in my opinion is third best behind Completely Legal and Medical. Driving with/on it is a bit more stern, hence the article above, but it's not a felony until you're selling or growing. Possession felonies begin at 200 grams (7.05 Oz), and not even a misdemeanor until you are caught in possession of over 100 grams (3.55 Oz) (which is kind of ridiculous to be carrying around anyways). 


* [The best summary of the law can be found here](http://www.theweedblog.com/ohiosummary/)


***There are no home-raids on users, and very rarely on dealers or growers either since there are few reports due to the social acceptance of pot in Ohio.*** 

The only complaint really is price, which is standard at $20 per gram, $60 per 1/8th, $110 per 1/4, $200 per 1/2, and $350 per ounce. (there is little to no variation of price based on quality, which does range but remains from low to high mids) this obviously beats some prices I've seen, but compared to the medical and legal states we're paying a fortune.


Quality is pretty standard as I mentioned above. Since it's not usually locally mass-cultivated, we don't have a huge range of strains and qualities, and must resort to buying based on what's available. That said, we get our bud from all over the country, even some from Canada which is directly north and thus easy to trade with. I have bought California, Michigan, Colorado AND Washington medical from within a 10 mile radius. **I am yet to see dirt weed in Ohio, I get relatively frosty nugs from every one of many dealers I have dealt with, and have not gotten shake a single time, (I've never even SEEN a seed before)**


Overall, I'd rate it at 7.5/10... We have our downsides like limited strains and obviously it's not legal or medical, but we have a decently relaxed legal system in regards to pot, a well-educated community, and some decent quality bud.","1372637750"

However, even the article talks about how there are different Mary Sue subtypes such as the poorly written character, author avatar, cliched character, infallible character, etc.

I think OP's question was in relation to those interpretations and they were asking of examples of original characters from published fiction that may share Mary Sue attributes. There are certainly characters out there, that at the most basic Mary Sue definition of ""idealized author avatar,"" exist in original pieces of narrative.

"fnv","t5_2rzr5","[Here is a nice tutorial that covers a few things about FNVEdit](http://youtu.be/qVKe51dRm2M), it should help you make a merged patch which should help the game run a bit more stably with those mods (At least if it's just some conflicts). The [4gb patch](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35262/?) might also help though I think it only really matters if you are using big texture packs.

As far as cleaning those DLC files goes you can always get fresh ones by doing this. Start by moving the ones you currently have into a backup folder (or just renaming them to something like HonestHears.esm.old), go into steam, right click on fallout new vegas, select properties, select local files and then select ""verify integrity of game cache"". As long as the files aren't in your new vegas directory anymore (or are renamed) it will redownload them just as they would be with a fresh patched install.","1372637759"

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","-Don't rage at your teammates, be polite and try to be a leading example. Compliment good plays from your teammates, if they feel good and a bit more confident they'll eventually play better than they already were.
-If you think you can go for baron/dragon/towers/inhibs then let your teammates know and only go for big objectives like baron or an inhib when everyone in the team agrees with you.
-Wards. Vision wins you the game, people in bronze and silver tend to think only the support should ward. WRONG. Everyone should buy wards!
-If the opposing team is warding heavily aswell then get your support/jungler to buy an oracles and clear out the other teams wards. AND DON'T LET THEM DO THAT ON THEIR OWN, don't let them get caught out in the enemy jungle and die with that 400g oracles. Move together as a team and destroy the enemies vision.

-Play strong champions that low elo players have difficulty dealing with like:
Evelynn/Shaco: Again this is all about vision, both of these champions have stealth and they force the enemy to buy pink wards which cost more money. If the enemy doesn't buy pink wards they are easy gank targets.

Twisted Fate/Shen: Thanks to their global ults they have constant map pressure past lvl 6 when their ult is up and can gank/help other lanes when needed. They're also brilliant splitpushers lategame and can force objectives lategame.

Jayce/Draven: Strong laners with high kill potential. A skilled Draven will just stomp a low elo player that doesn't know how to play against Draven. Jayce his poke and assasination potential are strong and a good Jayce can easily carry low elo games by himself.","1372637759"

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Very interesting about breathing habits. I don't think I can wear tighter than UK 28s or EM 60 (which is very firm). I don't have an 'indent' where the band is on my side, it's a straight line. I have very little difference between super tight and snug underbust and very little difference comparatively when inhaling all the way! Just not a lot of squish for a firm band. I don't think I could ever wear a 26 band! Well fitting cups is key, though. 

I have only ever had major issues with bras I am really trying to convince myself fit in the cup, but don't. I often have too-wide wires as a problem, so volume is lost in the cup. If it's not a perfect fit, I no longer keep it... I have 6 bras in rotation that imo are 'perfect' fits, wires are perfect, cups perfect, bands not too tight or too stretchy. It can be hard to find a perfect fit, but so worth it imo! I think this is why my ""looser"" bands don't ride up, too -- the cup fits well, nothing is 'pulling' the cup down and I don't need to tighten the straps much at all to pull the band up.","1372637762"

Worst decision of my life.

It ate two different memory cards--I mean *completely destroyed* them in the end due to the phone constantly and randomly unmounting them. Transferring music was excruciatingly difficult and buggy, and because I had to keep reformatting my SD cards, essentially pointless. On top of that, the music-playing apps are all terrible. Cell signal would randomly drop for hours at a time. Only way to tell was to dig deep into settings to see if it was connected to the network. (I couldn't even trust the antenna bars.) Even once it reconnected it would sometimes take hours to deliver missed messages, if they ever arrived. The entire phone was just laggy and hard to see at any angle. The camera was so-so if the lighting was perfect. Android was constantly trying to tell me something: ""It's 67 degrees out! I updated an app! You have an email READ IT NOW! Six other apps need updates you idiot! Your battery is low, can't you plug me in now you heartless cunt? Did you remember to unplug your charger, asshole?"" Android seems to always be playing catchup in features for apps. I'd have to hit the little onscreen buttons about six times to get the phone to react. Plus constantly waiting and wondering if the phone is going to get the next software update.

When I first encountered them in the Darkroot Garden I just watched them march around for a while, and I fell in love with them. That love waned when I met the big mushroom men, but I still didn't want to have to hurt the little ones.

Some time later I was exploring and I came across another group of mushroom men. When the little ones started walking towards me I just thought they would keep walking by, but instead they attacked! Hesitantly, I proceeded to kill all of the little one and their parents. I still didn't care about the parents deaths, but I had to say ""sorry"" each time I killed a little mushroom man. 

I felt bad having to kill them, but it wasn't until I died multiple times trying to leave this area that I realized how excluded they were from the rest of the world. In this world, hidden away from the horrors of the outside world, they lived in peace. As so many other times, I came where I wasn't wanted and slaughtered the residents.

Yep, it's pretty much this.

I was bitten in the face by a dog when I was 9. It was a dog owned by a family friend and was very well-behaved (you know, other than biting me in the face). I went to pet it and apparently it decided that it felt threatened, so it retaliated. If it had bitten me an inch higher, I would have lost my right eye.

Dogs and kids suck at communicating, and they *really* suck at communicating to each other. It's not difficult for a child to do something that makes a dog feel threatened and react.","1372637767"

"AFL","t5_2qhoy","I played junior tennis at queens park on the GC, as did Bernard, and I'm a year older than him so every 2nd year he would be in my division (the way the age groups work). Take it with a grain of salt if you will, but I smashed him every time we played. 

Anyway our families would spent a lot of time in the same areas and Bernard developed a thing for my sister (here's where the story picks up), and tried asking her out often to which he kept getting rejected. I think they went to the movies once but my sister wasn't interested in him.

He was a bit of a shut in, a classic case of a parent living though their child as his father basically quit his job to train him full time, which isn't his fault but since his fathers an asshole its not surprising he turned out similar (seeing all his antics and conflicts on the news).

In hindsight I should have kept playing but at the time I was over tennis so i quit when i was 17, and Bernard went off to join the regional team and the rest is a national story now. His current girlfriend is obviously a gold digger who doesn't give 2 shits about tennis, (you can see every time the camera cuts to her shes on her phone before someone nudges her and she starts clapping for Bernard, hilarious if its just after he lost a point.) and everyone has a dig at my sis saying that could have been her.","1372637767"

"minnesotavikings","t5_2qocl","I agree that there are some psychological issues wrapped up in having a clear #1 guy, but I also believe that Percy was basically a bad #1 receiver.

* He didn't help stretch the field (whether you ultimately blame Ponder for this or not).
* He isn't a polished route runner, so many plays must be designed to go to him rather than rely on reading a defense.  Without a real checkdown, Ponder and Musgrave end up looking like idiots when the play doesn't work.
* His YAC ability is huge, but I think that puts additional wear and tear on Percy himself and his blockers that might not occur when you compare short pass/significant YAC to a longer pass/shorter YAC.
* Obviously, he didn't see eye-to-eye with his teammates/coaches and didn't gracefully accept his role.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","The 380 is the least 'desirable' of the R107 SL's (1972-1989).  It has a flimsy single-row timing chain that is prone to failure.  Without seeing pictures, $8k is a bit too strong.  You could easily find a better 450SL or 560SL for that money.

Since it was built before 1986, you need to check that the front subframe mounts have either a) not cracked or b) have been reinforced.  This was an 'unofficial' recall that ALL 1985 and earlier models need to have done.

Ask for receipts.  Maintenance can be killer on these cars.  You should plan to do all the service yourself or find a local indie mechanic you can trust.  If the timing chain hasn't been changed or at least looked at, it needs to be done and if a full replacement is due, set aside another $1k to get it done.  For example: my well-sorted R107 still ate up $2800 in service this spring with a bunch of little things that needed to be done.

The climate control system in the car you've picked is the 'bottom of the barrel' when it comes to desirability/reliability.  Generally referred to as the 'Gen II' system, there is a certain servo in the system that is prone to breaking frequently and is expensive to replace.  Since you've mentioned this would be a daily driver, it's something to think about.

In terms of all R107 models in the US, the models produced after 1985 are the best due to the updated front subframe mounts, the far superior Gen III climate control system, and lots of other little fixes along the way.  If you find a 560 they're loads more powerful than any of the other US models.

With all that negative-ness out of the way, R107's are great cars.  I love mine and the styling is just timeless.  Parts are readily available online with almost all of them available to order through your local Mercedes-Benz dealer.  The Classic Center is also a great resource if you need help with anything.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The sun beat down upon him. He knelt, lips moving in prayer. As he worked through the rubric, he felt his arms tense and his muscles swell. *God is working mightily inside of me,* he thought. *I cannot lose.*

In the distance, a lone rider was approaching. He lifted his sword and prepared for the infidel to arrive.

Abduhlla gripped the reigns tighter. At the rise in the next hill stood the *kaffir.*  The imams had arranged for this battle to occur. Champion versus champion - a duel to see whom God really favored. The halberd attached to his saddle jerked with the motions of his horse. ""*Insha'Alaah.* He would gut the filthy deceiver and return as God's chosen. 


Dust began to swirl around them as they closed distance. The Christian adjusted his iron helm, pulling the strap tight. Abdullah dismounted and removed his weapon. 

The warriors slowly circled each other. Abdullah spun the shaft of his weapon around, pacing closer to the outsider.

The Christian struck the first blow. His massive blade reached out for his rival and was deflected by a quick turn of the pike. Abdullah swung the mighty blade, arcing toward his rival's eyes. The Christian took a great, loping swing. ""For Christ!"" he bellowed. Abdullah leaned back out of range. 

The warriors shifted and feinted. After several minutes of clashing steel, the Christian managed to strike a blow.

The heavy sword cut deep. Its weight made the strike bruise the bone beneath the flesh. After clearing the distance with his weapon, Abdullah brought his right hand to his chest. The blood that came away on his hand infuriated him. His mind turned to Allah. *If it is your will* he thought, *help me to slay the kaffir.*

He brought the butt of his weapon up. When the Christian dodged it, he brought the blade end of the weapon around. The strike missed the Christian's head, but caught him along the neck. Blood shot out in a great red mist. 

Staggered, the Christian whirled around, sword at his side. He lunged, and caught Abdullah in the stomach. The leather of his armor parted before the sharp blade. 

The maneuver left both men's weapons down. Abdullah closed the distance and grabbed hold of the Christian's wrists. 

""Why have you come here?"" Abdullah shouted. ""This is the land of my people! Your Christ does not belong here! The Prophet will destroy your false God!""

The Christian did not speak the other man's language. He did not know what was said, but the hostility showed through. He tried to cling to the infidel's arms, but the blood on his hands made the grappling difficult. 

""Defend me, Lord!"" Cried the Christian. His vision was failing. Their weapons were lying in the dirt, forgotten as they both tried to kill the other with bare hands. 

Abdullah gained the upper hand. He quickly moved behind the Christian, and pulled him into a headlock. He fell backwards, the Christian on top of him. He could feel the man's blood spurting from his neck. He pulled the lock tighter as the man struggled. *God is great,* he thought. *With God, all things are possible.*

The Christian threw his arms in the air. His hands waved wildly as he sought purchase against his assailant. *No,* he thought. *I am God's champion.* The world grew blurry as he desperately used the last of his strength. 

Soon, he was still.

Abdullah sat up, pulling the other man from on top of him. *God has blessed me,* he thought. *I have prevailed against the kaffir.*

He tried to stand.

The wound in his belly was too great. A bulge formed just to the side of his armor. His insides were coming out. He tried again to stand and mount his horse. He stumbled.

*I have slain the outsider,* He thought. *I give my life for mighty Allah.* The midday sun seared his flesh. His eyes rolled to his mount, where a bladder full of water waited. He crawled closer to the horse, his intestines spilling across the ground. Before he could reach the animal, his arms gave out. He slowly turned over, the hot sun burning into his eyeballs.

*God is great.* He thought. *God is great.*

Soon, the sun began to sink. The only movement was the lone horse, wandering off in search of water.

In the sand lay two warriors.

Two of God's heroes.","1372637779"

Defense is anyone's guess, though. I have absolutely no clue what we're gonna do at defensive end once Michael Sam graduates, and tackle is pretty much a total mystery for this year, let alone next year. There's some really great young athletes at linebacker, but they're basically untested as of right now. The secondary is also going to have some figuring out to do.

Germany could, however, close its embassy in the US. It probably can also opt to close off US access to military bases in Germany (the US uses them quite a bit), though I don't know if some of those bases are operating under similar laws/treaties to embassies. Even if they can't close off access to the military bases, they could likely opt to not supply those bases or similar activities, which could vary from crippling enough as to be de facto the same as closing off the base, or a mere annoyance for the US.

I'll translate it for you:

*1§ Anyone who illicitly:*

*1. transfers narcotics.*

*2. manufactures narcotics with intent to be used.*

*3. acquires narcotics with intent to pass it on*

*4. acquires, refines, packages, transports, keeps, or take other such position concerning narcotics which is not intended for personal use*

*5. touting drugs for sale, stores or transmits any payment for drugs, mediates contact between buyer and seller, or undertakes any other such measure, if the procedure is likely to promote drug trafficking, or*

*6. stores, uses or takes any other dealings in drugs*

*will be convicted, if the action is done willingly, for crimes against drug laws to jail in at the most three years.*

Which is not technically true. Drugs have their own scale of punishment, and some people have gotten up to 12 years, but that's rare as fuck. Also, the supreme court has redefined the sentences recently, which has caused a political uproar from prohibitionists who wants to enforce harsher laws to get harsher punishments again. 

As said, it's nuts. The police MAY keep you on the station if they as much as suspect something (or feel like fucking with you) for up to 6 hours to get a urine sample. After that they may force a blood test off of you before they let you go.","1372637784"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I think a PS3 price drop is more likely to come 6-12 months after the PS4 release. They wouldn't want people to not get a PS4 because they just got a PS3. I don't know what they did during the generation shifts of PS1 and PS2 though. If both of those were fairly consistent with each other then they will most likely do whatever they did then.

edit: Some research shows that the PS2 had a price drop 7 months before the PS3 came out and the PS1 had a price drop 14 months before the PS2 came out. Subsequent price drops weren't for 1 and 2 years, respectively, after release of the newer system. This is using US data.

It's hard to get precise price drops for PS3 because of all of the different models and HDD sizes. If we consider an HDD size increase without changing the price of the console as a price drop, then PS3 will have had a price drop about 14 months before the PS4 comes out. Which is consistent with the PS2 schedule.

So if history is any indicator (which it really isn't I guess because the industry has changed so much this generation) it is too close to PS4 release to do another price drop for at least a year after PS4 comes out. It might have been different in other countries though.","1372637789"

**Every piece of evidence confirms that gospel Jesus never existed.**

The following is a list of writers who lived and wrote during the time, or within a century after the time, that Christ is said to have lived and performed his wonderful works:  
  
Josephus, Philo-Judaeus, Seneca, Pliny the Elder, Suetonius, Juvenal, Martial, Persius, Plutarch, Justus of Tiberius, Apollonius, Pliny the Younger, Tacitus, Quintilian, Lucanus, Epictetus, Silius Italicus, Statius, Ptolemy, Hermogones, Valerius Maximus, Arrian, Petronius, Dion Pruseus, Paterculus, Appian, Theon of Smyrna, Phlegon, Pompon Mela, Quintius Curtius, Lucian, Pausanias, Valerius Flaccus, Florus Lucius, Favorinus, Phaedrus, Damis, Aulus Gellius, Columella, Dio Chrysostom, Lysias, Appion of Alexandria.  
  
Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.  
  
Philo of Alexandria was born before the beginning of the Christian era, and lived until long after the reputed death of Christ. He wrote an account of the Jews covering the entire time that Christ is said to have existed on earth. He was living in or near Jerusalem when Christ's miraculous birth and the Herodian massacre occurred. He was there when Christ made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  
  
He was there when the crucifixion with its attendant earthquake, supernatural darkness, and resurrection of the dead took place -- when Christ himself rose from the dead, and in the presence of many witnesses ascended into heaven. These marvelous events which must have filled the world with amazement, had they really occurred, were unknown to him. It was Philo who developed the doctrine of the Logos, or Word, and although this Word incarnate dwelt in that very land and in the presence of multitudes revealed himself and demonstrated his divine powers, Philo saw it not.  

From *""The Christ""* -- John E. Remsberg  
  
BTW, there's also nothing about Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls -- and there should be.  

As for the Wikipedia article, it was written by and for Christians. Not a reliable source of information at all.

I have friends who got high scores, went to a nice university, and then dropped out because of the work. Meanwhile, I know people (including myself) who got lower scores than them and are doing outstanding-even better than when we were in high school. The ACT is more about how fast you can BS a bunch of stuff. Those rich kids... Well their parents cheat the system and it pisses me off more becsuse I was rejected accomodations I deserved because my grades were too high before my diagnosis. Basically my struggle was undermined because I work my butt off harder than everyone else... Because they assume having a different mind means you are stupid with no potential of scoring high, and if you do decent, it *must* mean there's ""no problen"". It's closed minded and foolish. /end of mini ACT rant.

Anyways, what those parents do is wrong. But there's always going to be people abusing the system. Is it fair that some people can afford special ACT tutors to work independly with their child? Is it fair that some people live in higher-quality school districts? Is it fair that some students get to take classes that teach some of the content on the ACT while others can't? They get an advantage (which, once again, makes the ACT less accurate). But there will always be people cheating the system.","1372637793"

I don't know anyone who classifies themself as a liberal and seeks to eliminate all consequences for immoral behavior or completely level society so that advantages aren't profitable.

Since we're in /r/debatereligion, some focus, I suppose, should be put on the usage of the word ""God"" here.  Suffice it to say that the term is remarkably ambiguous and thus can be thrown into a million scenarios.  But whatever this strawman might think of a tyrannical government, it isn't a creator of the universe or existent in an immaterial realm, which makes it largely dissimilar to many monotheisms/some other theisms.

Though there's a poignant bit of irony in that the God believed in by many in the US is one which does make no consequences through the death of Jesus, claims the last shall be first, the meak shall inherit the earth, etc.  These grievances are vividly fantasized of in horror when thinking of a hypothetical government, but this author doesn't bat an eye when it comes to God.

"freelance","t5_2qhs9","There's a lot of nuance in these situations. Here are some thoughts to guide you:

* if you're valuable and they're not paying you what you feel you deserve, it makes sense to negotiate a higher number
* if you're kind of useful but they're already at the top of what they'd want to pay, and if you leaving would put them in a bad spot and you know it and use that to your advantage, they might pay now and start looking for a replacement. No one wants to get squeezed.
* depends on how much you want to raise things. Normally it's easy for people to understand ""I've been at this rate for X months, they're going up now"" when X is large (say 12). If you've been there 2 months at $25/hr, not much has changed and you ask for $50/hr, it might be a tough sell. 

Many people will tell you to charge as much as you possibly can and other things that are often a bit short sighted. I've had plenty of success charging what I think is a fair rate at the time, making good connections and referrals, and increasing the amount more usually when switching clients than upping on any one particular client.

The pills I'm on right now are lower dose than my American pills and deliver a consistent dose of hormones until I stop taking them for 7 days, starting my period.

Watch the amount of protein you are eating (it is very very common for people to have too much protein in their diet) Try to aim for protein intake to be more than 46 grams a day, and no more than 70 grams a day. 

A very useful tool is an [RDI calculator](http://www.fatsecret.com/Default.aspx?pa=rdic). Use it, and that's really all you need. Exercise isn't really NEEDED, but keep doing it, because it is doing many beneficial things other than weight loss.","1372637801"

The song and the trip seemed to last forever, seeing as I'm still recalling it, perhap it is.

"neology","t5_2snyc","*Erfolgstraurigkeit* is a German words, as we are allowed to make them up on the fly.  However, it doesn't have a particulary great ring to it, nor does it capture a sufficiently distinct or relatable feeling - so it's unlikely to be used. It still might be in a poetic or lyric context.

The feeling he describes there is related to but not quite *Versagensangst* - the fear of failure. To me, *Erfolgstraurigkeit* more sounds of *Einsamkeit des Siegers* -  loneliness of the winner (""it's lonely at the top""), or the emptiness you might feel after resolving the purpose of your life. 

---

As for the original question:

There's no existing (i.e. regulary used) word for that AFAI'm aware of, I guess  that means it's not a particulary german feeling :) 

As we'd have to combine four concepts (trivial, tedious, success and shame), it's hard to construct an appropriate word. 

I'd probably go with *Leere des banalen Erfolgs* - emptiness of mundane success - leaving the shame only in the self-evaluation and barely keeping the time aspect. 

We could build a single word from that: *Banalerfolgsleere* - but it's the same as *Erfolgstraurigkeit*: unable to trigger an instant recognization of the feeling in someone hearing it for the first time. 

---- 

A very specific term might be *Daddelreue*. 

*Daddeln* is the act of repetetive, meaningless game, primarily on computers / machines. 

*Daddelreue* would be the regret of having spent a long time that way - and could be recognized at least by gamers who felt it before. 


----

One could look for a less literal, more metaphoric word, but good ones are lucky finds. 

*Couchreue* or *Sofascham* - ""couch regret"" / ""couch shame"" - might be recognized as the regret and shame of spending the whole day on the couch. 

*Provinzheldenjammer* or *Provinzleuchtenjammer* - ""backwater hero misery"" might be in the right direction and at least has some ring to it (IMO). 
*leuchte* here is something like a luminary, but often used belittleing with a hint of derogatory. ""Provinzheld"" is a not uncommon word, jammer can be both the wailing e.g. about the time wasted, as well as the feeling of misery that could overcome an observer.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Egyptian here.

I joined the anti-Morsi protests at the Presidential Palace and then walked to the pro-Morsi protests which were a few kilometers away.

If we're going to compare numbers, here's my take.

Anti-Morsi protests were all over the country. In every major city. In Cairo alone, there were several large protests each having a few hundreds of thousands protesters. 

Tahrir square was packed to the full. Streets leading to the square were full.

[This is the view overlooking a bridge leading to Tahrir](http://i.imgur.com/fUYmrZu.jpg). That's only one of the 5 streets leading to the square.

[This is the view of the same bridge but from the opposite angle](http://productnews.link.net/general/news/30-06-2013/n/tahrir_2013630211646.jpg) 

[Here's a view from one corners of the square.](http://i.imgur.com/tLrQ2Hb.jpg)

[Here's a bird's eye view of the square](http://elbadil.com/sites/default/files/styles/428xauto_node_image_2/public/13/06/26/lthryr_nhr_wlyl_13_copy_1.jpg)

[Another protest near the Presidential Palace](http://i.imgur.com/pU63fLB.jpg). This picture was taken after nightfall when many protesters started leaving.

That was in Cairo only.
Here's picture from other cities.

[Mansoura](http://i.imgur.com/poOqU0J.jpg), [Sharqiya, Morsi's hometown](http://i.imgur.com/ksSpl1i.jpg), [Mahala](http://i.imgur.com/hyPd8Xu.jpg) and [Alexandria.](http://i.imgur.com/Iqkzrry.jpg)

In my estimation, the overall numbers all over the country are in millions.

Now with the pro-Morsi protests. The Muslim Brotherhood gathered most of it's male members from all over the country and shipped them through buses to one pro-Morsi protest in Cairo. Almost every able man (young or old) was shipped to Cairo leaving the rural cities nearly depleted from their existence. That's one single protest in the entire country. It was a big protest indeed, but they were few hundred thousand protests at best. They are strongly motivated and sincere. Yet I see them as brainwashed, manipulated and used as tools by their leaders.

Walking into their protest/sit-in after coming from the anti-Morsi protests was a surreal experience. 
The anti-Morsi protest was mostly liberal and well-dressed (western clothes) women and girls. The majority of protesters were upper-middle class. The pro-Morsi protests were mostly bearded, modestly clothed men. I've only seen a handful of veiled women. The difference in lifestyle and ideology was appalling.

I summarized the experience to my FB friends as follows. Praying with the Ikhwan is more reverent, Hanging out with anti-Moris protests is more fun :)","1372637812"

I ended up making a Green/red deck designed to field large numbers of creatures. Make them extremely strong. Either throw them at the enemy or use a Prized Unicorn to just stampede them for massive damage

I then added infect, proliferate and eldrazi conscription to the deck. Somehow people disliked a Blight Mamba being made 11/11 with annhilator, often a totem aura protecting it or just using the regenerate and then a prized unicorn allowing me to make a 1 hit kill with the mamba","1372637817"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Faith is simple. But it's not easy.

Often times, we find ourselves (our flesh) reaching out for other explanations, other sources of truth, and other ways of viewing the world that don't necessitate seeing people as either saved or destined for hell.

Nobody ever said that atheists aren't kind, compassionate, loyal people. It's good that you have friends like that, however they might identify their religious beliefs or lack thereof.

Here's what I see in your post. You have relied on and put your faith in a girlfriend and smoking pot to keep you sane/happy. And you have discovered that with the removal of those things, your stability has disappeared.

This is the purpose of joy. Happiness is fleeting. And we often find ourselves happy in sin. But joy does not leave you. It stays, even through the worst times.

Romans 5:1-5

1 Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we boast in the hope of the glory of God. 3 Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; 4 perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.

You need to put your faith in Christ. You need to trust in Him. Christ *is* the answer for everybody. That does not mean that they only find him in buildings with crosses on them on Sundays. Christ is the only hope for this fallen world.

We are born of sin and flesh. We are not born capable of real love, only a shadow of real love. Only in knowing and loving God are we able to offer true love to our neighbor, God's love.

&gt;I want to commit myself to god but its not that simple.

It is that simple. But it is not easy. Faith is a process. It is a gift that we are given when we ask for it honestly. It requires humility, a recognition of how truly fallen you are in your flesh, and a realization that you are helpless to save your self. God teaches us how to nurture the seed of faith into a large tree that we can trust in, rest upon, and see the fruit that it bears. Not only in our own life, but in the lives of those around us who we love and see God's love in us.","1372637818"

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","The simulation argument is a really fun contemporary argument, I think--I especially like how a number of people are dumbfounded by it, just the reaction a good skeptical argument should have.

But the argument I really want to talk about is from the 12th century: Abelard's argument against material essence realism (there is something in the matter of an individual that makes the individual the type of thing it is), which is both ingenious and entirely decisive. It has some contemporary interest (many people believe something like material essence realism about DNA). The argument goes something like this:

a) There is a material part of an individual, its material essence, which makes it the type of thing that it is (i.e. that makes it instances of certain universals).
b) At least some of the properties of the individual are the properties of its material essence (i.e. are inherited from the universals that the individuals are instances of).
c) Each individual is wholly and entirely the type of thing it is (all of Browny is donkey, and all of Socrates is human--Browny's tail is a donkey tail, Socrates is a human even in his little toe and the tips of his hair).
d) Thus, from (a) and (d), all of the properties of the individual are also properties of the material essence (because all of the individual falls under the universal, all of it the contains the essence).
e) Individuals are multiple types of things at once (Browny the donkey is both an ass and an animal, Socrates the philosopher is both a human and an animal).
f) Thus, from (d) and (e), the properties of Browny the donkey and animal are also the properties of Socrates the human and animal. Thus, Browny is irrational (because donkeys are irrational, but also rational (from Socrates's rationality), an absurd conclusion.

(d) is the crucial move. The point is that, by identifying a part of the individual's matter as how universals become instantiated in individuals, you lose a way to distinguish the properties of the individual from those of the universal. There are moves people have made to get out of it, but I won't list them (and why they fail) right now--to get out of the bind you need to find a place other than an individual's matter and the universals it falls under for it to get properties from, but there are no options to follow which don't make you give up material essence realism.","1372637825"

"LANL_German","t5_2rd5y","It's einladen, ludet ein, eingeladen. As /u/FerroFox noted, the Präteritum form (first past) will be understood, but is quite uncommon in contemporary colloquial german. 

In addition, be aware that there is a distiction between *einladen* and *laden*. To invite is *einladen* (einladen can also mean ""to load into"" (a car/truck/...)), while *laden* can either mean ""to charge (a battery)"", or ""to load (a truck or vehicle or device)"", or, and that is the closest relation here ""to summon"" or ""to subpoena"", as in ""he was summoned by the court"". 

Sometimes it is still used in it's original meaning of *to invite* in very formal contexts, but at least to me, when not used in a very obviously strongly formal context, it has a connotation of ""to force someone to come"". 

So until you aquire a good feeling for when you can use *laden* you might want to avoid it in this context.","1372637829"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Here's some fatherly advice...gay is not synonymous for what ever adjective you are looking for to describe your need for fatherly approval, love and connection as weak, pathetic and/or unmanly. And even more so those needs should never be considered weak, pathetic or unmanly.

On a more post related note I know what it's like to seek an absent fathers approval. You have to do what you have to do for yourself. It's not your problem your dad doesn't find interest in you, that's his problem. You clearly are passionate about bikes, but make sure it's for you and not for him. And just keep saving and keep the end goal in mind. Don't do something that is going to screw your situation up just to try to relate to and get close with someone who has a track record of not seeming like he wants to be a part of your life.

Now I don't know you or your dad but remember just because you get a bike doesn't mean that you and your dad will all of a sudden become besties. In the end of it you my get the bike but not the dad, because (now remember I don't know you, your dad or the situation I am merely inferring from your post) any father who is only interested in being part of their childs life if they are in to motorcycles may not be th best type of person to have around and perhaps you should look for a fatherly figure elsewhere. Like finding a mentor or another relative that you can relate to, rely on and talk to on deeper levels. 

But I understand the fatherly void, and the desire and follow through on doing things that may not be in your best interest in order to fill or repair that need. If you decide you have to do something like that(going into debt over your head for a bike or continuing to save and dream that the bike will solve your father issues) well emotional needs are a fickle beast that are hard to deny, so do what you gotta do, but understand the risks (unmanagable debt over motorcycle/continued fatherly rejection despite bike ownership/getting into a deadly dangerous sport not for your ownsake but to appease another )

But like another said, I would really closely examine whether your dad deserves a relationship with you.....and find a mentor or maybe seek someone like a counselor or therapist or relative or mentor to talk to about your father and your feelings and shit","1372637830"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Not a lot of Irish people get the dh consonant cluster. Best way to explain it is as a 'y' sound. Like how Maedhbh is pronounced Maeve. Though that's not explaining why a bh makes a 'v'. It can also make a 'w' if you're a bit northern. 

Thank you so much for revealing this to me. It's completely changed my perception of what the Others are like. It makes their link with the old gods of the north a lot stronger. And suggests that there is a lot more to their ways and culture than what has been revealed to us so far in the books. It would make more sense of the Night's King story Old Nan tells.

Also the quote reminds me a lot about a story I heard when I was small. It was about this man who got led by some of the sídhe (It's doing my head in slightly having an Irish word in an English sentence but not having the right grammar apply to it.) away from his home to a fairy fort as they were known. There he was let in to their home to join in some feast. There were other humans with him too. After the great feast with their queen and all that it was time to leave. They had to splash magic water over their eyes so that the sídhe would become invisible to the humans again. But yer man was lazy and only splashed one. So then days later he's going to the market and spots their queen among the people. She see's him looking at him and realises he can see her and didn't wash one of his eyes. So she walks up to him and tears his eyes from their sockets and throws them away. So yeah. If this is what the others are going to be like then I cannot wait for TWOW. ","1372637837"

Oft have I digg’d up dead men from their graves, And set them upright at their dear friends’ doors, Even when their sorrows almost were forgot; And on their skins,as on the bark of trees, Have with my knife carved in Roman letters, ‘Let not your sorrow die,though I am dead.’ Tut,I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly, And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand more.”

I didn't mind; in fact I enjoyed the attention. One day my friend found out his AIM screen name, im'ed him, and used to have lengthy, pretty flirty chats (some of them pushing the envelope). i chatted with him on AIM too, but I just thought he was being a cute, comedic, young at heart pervy old dude. Didn't really think much of it. Years later he got fired for nibbling on some girl's ears. Yikes. Went a little too far there.


Bonus story! My cool &amp; young 7th grade teacher told one of the kids to watch over the class while she stepped outside to order U2 tickets. After being on her cell phone for about 10 minutes, she got 'em and we didn't have homework that day. Pretty sweet! Years later I recounted this story to my S.O. to which they replied ""digisake...that's not what a cool teacher does. That's what an irresponsible teacher does.""

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Check out your seasonal ingredients they will be cheaper/fresher usually. For instance I live in NC so sweet potatoes, kale, collards,mustard greens, cabbage (red is more nutritous, but green is good too) are sold almost year round at low prices and are extremely nutritious. They can be found cheaper/fresher at food stands/farmers markets too. Lentils and beans are cheap as well and highly nutritious. Quinoa is also cheap and a good replacement for some of that rice. Replace some of that white rice with brown rice, quinoa, and beans.  Pressure cooking or slow cooking them and/or soaking/sprouting them overnight will reduce the time to make them easily. Black beans are the anti-oxidant bean king but get a variety. Lots of spices added to these dishes improve the taste and nutrition at low cost. Banana's are a high sugar fruit and you need some more variety. Buy apples and oranges/grapefruits in the bags and have 1-2 of each a day. Other fruits such as blueberries are usually cheaper frozen, blend them in a healthy smoothy to get tons of nutrient power.

Think of it like instead of a 10/11 split, its actually a 10.5 +/- .1 split that will swing it each way. Thats not exactly how it is, but how it works using my scaling formula.

I'll probably still use my formula for my purposes since it applies to everything but those two stat points which i'll likely hardcode into my sim. the same should apply to cast speeds. I'll try and remember what I did to get that value, so i can apply it to other spells.

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","You should replay the game ignoring all the hype and anti-hype and focusing on what's going on in the story as a puzzle. I think when we play a game with others' opinions in mind or trying to compare it to another game it really distorts the game to us. As an example I recently played Tales of Symphonia which my buddy hypes to no end and all I could think was ""this is nowhere near what buddy X was talking up"" the whole time. Really ruined the game for me.

Anyway Cloud isn't depressed most of the game like I know a lot of people say he is. In fact he's downright cocky and flippant in the beginning and he still retains a lot of confidence for most of the game. It's not until [Sephiroth starts to control him against his active will](/spoiler) that he starts to become depressed. After Tifa [helps him put his mind back together](/spoiler) he's still sad, but actively works to get better and does so, being optimistic by the end of the game. If anything I'd say he jumps back *too* fast to being optimistic and confident after most incidents in the game since he seems to be extremely easy to influence and peptalks always get him right back on his feet as opposed to, say, Cecil of IV who broods about everything no matter what the rest of the team says. Even after Aerith dies Cloud doesn't mope about it as much as you would expect considering [he attacked her himself and then afterwards failed to stop Sephiroth from finishing the job](/spoiler).

Tifa is the one who spends most of the game feeling insecure and depressed. She is always questioning things and wondering if the party is doing the right thing, not saying her complete thoughts because she's not sure of herself, etc. The hype for her is that she's a really strong person, but if you play the game without that hype in mind she is emotionally very dependent on Cloud and even admits it at one point as well as [decides to forgo a chance at saving the world to stay by Cloud's side when you discover him in Mideel](/spoiler).

VII is a game I think you really have to play twice. The first time so much doesn't make sense and none of the characters ever address so many things they're easy to just pass off as weird quirks or miss entirely. It's not until you really know the story and replay that you start catching a lot of small things. Tifa hesitating to speak up in a scene might just seem like she's a bimbo or weak-willed (how I took it the first time I played the game). It's not until your second playthrough you'll recognize that the hesitation is because [she realizes there are things wrong with Cloud that do not match up to her own memory and she's struggling with how to handle it and whether she should trust and support him or tell her concerns about him to the others](/spoiler).

OK that all said though, I have to agree VII isn't the greatest game for character development. There is a lot in there, but one of the things VII really struggles with is balancing character background and depth with an engaging quest. In the end character psyche exploration loses to questing and a lot of stuff that is important to understanding the characters is barely mentioned and never discussed. The only character Sephiroth ever shows any closeness to, for instance, is Professor Gast (this being before they retconned in Genesis and Angeal). There's like one or two lines that ever address this and show the confusion (and most likely abandonment) he felt when [Gast left Shinra to go find the true Ancients without an explanation to anyone](/spoiler). And then there's about five lines in the entire game that discuss how much he despises Hojo (his caretaker after Gast). The game is *horrible* at delving into things like this that are important for character motivation.

Personally I'll take it over the circus they came up with for Crisis Core, but VII is a game that's about the adventure and about the plot twist. If that's what you're playing for it's an awesome game. If you're playing for something like VI or XIII where everyone has a story with a line of character development that is going to be the focus for a certain amount of hours of gameplay you are definitely going to be disappointed.","1372637844"

Because I don't get much time to play I've kind of been overthinking how I'll approach this game once P4 begins and our actions become permanent.


The biggest trouble I have with games is do I pick something good for soloing since I won't group very often, or do I pick something good for grouping so I loose fewer opportunities to group when I actually have the time to do so?  And what jobs will people want, but not want more than one of in a group?  In WoW it was easier with dual specs.  Right now Arcanist almost seems like it has dual specs though, since xp is shared between a class and its jobs.  If I understand what I've ready correctly...

- Summoner is a DD with some buffs.  Damage and pets would lead me to believe this could be an adequate job for soloing.  If the buffs are good maybe I'd even get into so groups more easily than a straight DD.
	
- Scholar is a healer with some additional support.  Healers get groups pretty easily.  So if there was something I really wanted to group for and Summoner wasn't getting invited fast enough, maybe this would be the trick.


Plan B is a White Mage.  People love dem White Mages and with the defensive buffs and the stance that swaps INT and MND you can probably get a fair bit done by your lonesome.  Only draw back is that people probably only want one in a group.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","I've always liked words and word-based puzzles.  I played a lot of scrabble and boggle when I was little.

For my last two years of high school, I decided instead of taking the standard English class, which was basically a lit class, to take ""English Language"", an English linguistics class, partially on the recommendation of my mum and partially because I'd just read a Steven Pinker book which had been interesting, even though I didn't understand much of it (I think it was *Words and Rules*).

I quite enjoyed the classes at first because I seemed to get the concepts pretty well.  It was the only class in high school I liked, along with Biology.

In the last year of high school, I did the [OzClo linguistics olympiad](http://www.ozclo.org.au/) in its inaugural year.  I found I really liked working with data sets in foreign languages and I realised linguistics was basically just awesome puzzles.  Our team came first in the state and second in the country.

When high school finished, I was tossing up on whether to do an arts degree with a major in linguistics or a science degree with a major in evolutionary biology (I'd also been reading Richard Dawkins' early books vociferously).  I didn't have the marks to do a double degree so in the end I decided on Arts.

[My first year linguistics lecturer](http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/xt733/iam_linguist_and_author_professor_kate_burridge/) [was awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCTgNyA3DY) and got me and a whole bunch of other students really excited about linguistics.  Over the course of my degree, my terror at the prospect of having to get a real job and my enjoyment of linguistics led me to do an honours year.  Despite the agony that is honours, I really enjoyed doing my own research and really wanted to do some fieldwork, so here I am doing a PhD.","1372637847"

As far as I'm aware, China generally doesn't have a tradition of that sort of naming, so while you could make ""a name"" that meant that, most Chinese people probably wouldn't recognize it as a name. ""Son of Zheng He,"" for example, would be 郑和之子, but I don't think anyone would read that as a name and I don't know of any way to construct it as one.

I suppose if you didn't need to be quite so specific about which Zheng, you could name someone 郑之子 (Zheng's son) and that at least looks like a name. But ""之子"" is still a pretty weird given name, and I think most people would still read it like a phrase rather than a name unless told otherwise.","1372637856"

"thelastofus","t5_2t7gp","I found it to be implicit in my response, but I'll elaborate.

from any iteration of a utilitarian perspective, joel's actions are utterly horrific. not only did he mercilessly slaughter many people on his quest, but taking ellie away from the fireflies (not to mention killing the doctor/s, which is a specialized and difficult skill that I'm sure is rare in their world) would undoubtedly cause the suffering and death of untold millions, perhaps billions, more. the continued decline of humanity, for his selfish wish to lead a semblance of normal life with his surrogate daughter.

yes, choosing to save a life is admirable, but you cannot deny the self-centered attitude that joel displays throughout the game; his love for ellie is real, but it is an extension of his own grief and regret regarding sarah, and that prevents him from seeing the horror of his situation and actions. from an individualistic perspective, joel is heroic--but when it comes down to the fate of humanity, he's a coward. ellie's gift is bigger than the two of them.

edit: this isn't to say that I don't admire ND's depiction of joel as a character--they obviously worked very hard to make him someone that the player can relate to and root for, and they pulled it off extremely well--but from a distanced perspective, the context of his actions is very different.","1372637856"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is a lot of great advice on this thread. But lets keep it really simple for a moment. They are really easy to spot and deal with without a whole lot of analysis or mind-fuckery (which, they are really good at, so it's almost always a losing situation). 

**Identification:**

They make you feel like shit. Period. It doesn't matter what they do or say, or who is or is not 'at fault', after you interact with them you come away confused, mad, or sad -but mostly confused, because they don't play by the same rules that we do. 

This might happen right away, or they may have been able to charm you for a bit before it happens, but it always happens.

**Mitigation:**

Avoidance. Seriously, there is no other way. You cannot change them, and engaging them plays into the drama and they love the drama-game. They'll always win the drama-game, so don't bother playing. 

Do NOT talk shit about them, or confide in on other friends/family/co-workers. This sets the stage for a drama-game. Again, a game you can't win.

Simply avoid them when you can. And if you cannot avoid them then you have to learn how to emotionally avoid them even when in their physical presence. 

How to learn emotional avoidance:

Start playing poker. Really, just start playing poker. That game is largely about luck, but it's also about bluffing and hiding emotion. You'll need the ability to hide your emotion and recognising 'the game' in order to deal with these people. 

I have a few of them in my life, ones that I cannot avoid. When I'm around them I put myself in 'Player' mode. This does NOT mean that I also become a manipulator (because that's shitty and counter productive). But it does mean that I realize that any emotional 'zingers' that they throw my way are just a part of the game. I don't engage that shit. If it's possible not to respond to the zinger, I don't respond, if a response is necessary, I put on my poker-face and say, ""Oh, OK that's nice."" or ""Sorry, you feel that way, lets talk about a solution""

Don't engage them when they are 'venting' about someone else. Just put on Poker Face. Don't engage them when they are venting about you, no matter how hard you want to stand up for yourself. The most you should ever do is say, ""We disagree on that, but lets focus on solving this/or that/ problem""

Stay very in moment, into real world problem solving mode. Do not let them drag you into conflict or emotional reactions. Talking about feelings is not safe with these people. It sucks, but it's true.

Know that you can never resolve how they 'feel' about any given issue because their 'feelings' are simply a hatchet they use to chop you up. Your only armor is to avoid these people, or come up with physical solutions to issues/barriers to living/working with them. If they refuse to go into a solution based discussion, then exit the conversation immediately. 

But really, if you can, just cut these people out of your life if you can and don't even sweat it.

TLDR; Manipulators are easy to spot - They make you feel like shit, and they can do it with a smile on their face. Manipulators are easy to deal with - Avoid them if possible, if not possible to avoid, refuse to play the game. ","1372637857"

A satisfying relationship for many people requires an emotional attachment and it would be more telling, from my perspective anyway, if you bonded much better with women rather than men.

It sounds like you are having trouble feeling a close attachment with men. Consider making friends in the gay community and maybe you'll find someone that you can get close to and trust. Feel fortunate that you are living in a time when there isn't quite the stigma attached to being gay and relax and enjoy the learning experience.","1372637860"

BECAUSE INSTALLATION REQUIRES ADMIN RIGHTS (DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU CHOSE TO INSTALL IT, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR USER DIRECTORY FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T REQUIRE ADMIN RIGHTS TO INSTALL IN)  AND THAT'S NOT GOOD IF YOU WANT TO BE A PORTABLE APP SINCE IT USUALLY RUNS FROM AN USB DRIVE.    
  
 
Nothing requires admin rights to install and only apps that need admin rights for what they do (low-level access to drives to defragment, access to admin areas to clean, etc) require admin rights.

We had a bathroom attached to our class, which he only let the girls use, so he could 'keep an eye on them'. 

He gave us powdered pesticide to sprinkle on the school's vegetable garden on an incredibly windy day. I remembered it making tornados.

He told the kid with a severe peanut allergy to suck it up while making birdfeeders out of pinecones and peanut butter. The kid, luckily, wasn't stupid, and left class even though he was threatened with suspension. This kid later had all of his things thrown on the floor by the teacher, and made to pick them up.

He would smack kids in the face with a foot long stick, saying it 'made them smarter'. 

Other shit too, but I ended up transferring out of his class halfway through the year, mostly because he was batshit stonkers.","1372637867"

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","A $1 wooden spoon can dish out a wonderful spanking, but is more likely to break in the process than a more expensive version.  Craft paddles are more likely to be made of soft woods which will break more easily.  Hard woods are (in theory) more sturdy.  It's always possible to get a piece that had an imperfection in the wood and then even the more expensive hardwoods can be weak.  (The same is true in furniture... or anything made of wood.)  The thing is, when a cheap paddle breaks it was cheap and easy to replace... on the other hand if you're painting it then it's about to be precious to both of you so you probably want something that has that added bit of structure to it.  Some woods are expensive because they are more rare.  Oak is very hard.  Cherry is hard but also rare, so it will be more expensive than the oak.  Cedar is softer, but more rare than a white pine so it'll run similarly to oak.  (If it's unfinished cedar also smells nice... unless you had hamsters as a kid... then it smells like hamster cage.)  Poplar is a nice in between wood.  Walnut has a beautiful large grain and is a nice hard wood. Oak has a small spotty grain, but if you're looking to paint over it I think that would be less distracting a pattern than something bigger.  Pine is soft, but cheap... and a pine craft paddle might be ok but not great.  Some of your craft paddles could be balsa wood and those would die on the first use, I think.

On the third hand, hard woods don't flex as much... and while the difference is subtle I tend to enjoy the flex of something a little softer.... the again I tend to enjoy something that flexes more than wood in general  (my favorite is somewhere between plastic and rubber in texture) so probably my tastes are just different than yours.

As for painting a more expensive paddle... no problems there it won't hurt the structural integrity of the wood to be painted.  If you can get one that is completely unfinished you might get the best results with your paint sticking where you want it.  If you want to keep your paint job intact then I'd suggest adding a few clear coats of a clear poly or acrylic on top of the painting you do.  (If it's already been sealed with an oil based thing then you probably want to seal with an oil based clear as well... but that's less likely nowadays because the industry is moving to waterbased/ plastics.)  When using clear NEVER put a fan on it or you risk it drying cloudy.  

If you buy from a home vendor on a place like etsy you may be able to request an unfinished paddle.  I've had good luck getting custom tweaks for equipment there.  

EDIT: Thickness matters too.  A pine paddle 3/4"" thick won't swing through the air as nicely but is also really sturdy... and 3/8"" oak is probably a similar strength.

Yes, it's possible it's hard to read. I did my best but I'm not good with splitting text/ideas into paragraphs. The lack of shift+enter on Reddit doesn't help that either. Sorry. Oh and I see now Reddit screwed up my quotes, sorry for that as well. Typed that in MS Word to make it a bit easier for me and it looks like I typed a shift + enter instead of an enter a couple of times. I did my rereading in Word and not in Reddit so I didn’t notice those errors. Sorry. :/

Sorry for taking so long to reply as well, needed enough time to write a proper reply. :)

&gt;There is no ""straw man"" going on here, you said ""be careful on giving your opinion on things"", this is a warning, this is, in fact, suggesting that Lewis shouldn't given an opinion on things as, as you just suggested ""people [...] will value Lewis' opinion more highly because ""he does something on the Internet with video games"". You warned Lewis about giving his opinion on things, I'm not putting words in your mouth and if there was no problem with Lewis giving an opinion on things you wouldn't have had to give that warning, hence you believe that Lewis isn't allowed to have an opinion

You are reading way more into that line than I had intended. You think my warning was way more aggressive than it actually was intended. In fact, upon reading your reply, you take everything I say as very aggressive, a lot more aggressive than I had intended too. More on that later though. What I intended when I originally said that line was: “Be careful how you phrase your opinion, be careful because people might think your opinion is a representation of a game’s quality.” Not: “Becareful on what topics you give your opinion on.” I read my original post again now and I understand this sentence can be taken in a number of ways. I didn’t think twice about it since I didn’t think that an argument this big would come of it. Still, I tried to clarify in the following posts but I see those can be misinterpreted as well if you didn’t know my original opinion in the first place.

That means that, from my perspective, you were making a straw man argument. You were misrepresenting my opinion and attacking that opinion, which was a much easier opinion to attack so it made sense to call it a straw man. But again, didn’t properly express opinion in the first place so sorry for lashing out.

The thing I meant to say all along was that he should be careful in how he phrases his opinion. Straight up saying something is terrible, without any explanation, is a very strong opinion. Furthermore, the opinion he gave: “and it turned out to be a terrible game” was just a side note on my original comment. And third, he gave his opinion without any disclaimer whatsoever, making it look like he was giving an accurate representation of the game’s quality. It looked like he didn’t put a lot of thought in the way he expressed his opinion yet he expressed a very strong one. Therefore, I reminded him that he has to be careful in how he phrases it since people will value his opinion more highly, even though it says nothing about the quality. (I understand that you don’t think people value Lewis’ opinion more highly, however, I can tell you already nothing you say will convince me otherwise though. I guess the best way to explain why I feel this way is this. People want to be successful, people also admire successful people and use them as role models. People will try to be like their role models, this also means copying them in an attempt to be like them. Take for example a plain street gang. You have the gang leader and you have the followers, the followers will try to be exactly like the gang leader in order to get respect, street cred whatever. This also works for celebrities, you have so many people that ape Paris Hilton in everything she says and does, the way she talks, the way she dresses etc. That is why people like Paris Hilton start their own clothing/perfume/lingerie line, to cash in on the people trying to be just like her. This is the same for the Yogscast by the way, how many cheap knockoffs have you seen trying to ape the Yogscast’s success by doing the same as they do? In fact, Minecraft is a prime example of that. A few people get famous because they make Minecraft videos and boom, just like that, everyone is making Minecraft videos in an attempt to ape these people’s success. We can see people are heavily influenced by their role models, there is no reason not to assume people can also be influenced in a big way by these role models’ opinions. I think it is able to sway people’s buying behaviour.)

&gt; And there is no ad hominem their either,…

Dude, “spewing your nonsense” is the most dysphemistic way to convey your thoughts you could’ve used. My argument definitely did not call for that, I had been clear and polite up to that point. There was no reason to write it the way you did if you just wanted a final stab at my argument. No, you had to be as disrespectful as you possibly could.

&gt;if you want to talk about flaws in an argument and ad hominem then look no further than your own, the biggest case of ad hominem in my argument was the use of the word ""nonsense"", yet in your argument you include the unnecessarily aggressive ""sort your fucking argument out"", ""passed your fucking course"" and the passive aggressive ""let's not point out each other's logical fallicies/gaping holes in each other's argument, shall we?"" As you say, ad hominem is childish, so you might want to cut it out.

This is what I meant by saying you automatically take everything that looks aggressive as aggression aimed at you. Let’s take a look.

&gt; you include the unnecessarily aggressive ""sort your fucking argument out"", ""passed your fucking course""

I don’t even understand how you can think these are aimed towards you. These are obviously [expletives.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expletive_attributive). I never understand why people are opposed to other people using them and why they think it’s aggression aimed at them. I can understand you’re opposed to random swearing. However, when you’re using only text to communicate, no non-verbal language, you have to use text to express emotions, to indicate how you felt upon reading/seeing what the person you’re replying too said or did. Strong words used as expletives will always help convey that emotion/seriousness that you want. You are obviously one of the people that takes this as a personal offense. Can you please explain how you came to think that since I really, really don’t understand how you could interpret that as a personal attack. It might help me avoid pissing off people like you, who take it as a personal offense.

&gt; and the passive aggressive ""let's not point out each other's logical fallicies/gaping holes in each other's argument, shall we?""

Hmm, I agree this one might have been a bit below the belt, I was a bit pissed off because of your disrespect and your straw man. (Again, I understand the straw man is probably because of errors on my part.) Still, saying you aren’t going to mention something, mentioning it in the process and therefore focusing even more attention on it is a legitimate rhetorical device. It’s called “praeteritio” and it usually isn’t frowned upon.

&gt;To refer to something you mentioned in a previous comment, the Yogscast do have a history of reviewing games, they reviewed Fallout 3, Final Fantasy XIV, Star Trek Online, LOTR Online, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows for the Game Station.

I skimmed through those videos again. Yeah, I hate to break it to you but those aren’t reviews, it might say so in the title of the video but they really aren’t. Most of those videos are videos them goofing around in a game while talking about the game they’re playing. Some have some review-y elements, others (like the Star Trek videos) are YoGPoDs with gameplay in the background. The core concepts of a review are listing a game’s features, explaining which of those features work or don’t work within the game itself (Which ones are good and add to the gameplay? Which ones are buggy/unfinished/don’t add to the game?), something about whether the game is worth the money and a comparison, including the game but not exclusively about the game, of the good things (Price, quality, etc.) and the bad things (excessive DRM, installation problems etc.). That is what a videogame review is for me. If the Yogscast’s videos do qualify as reviews for you, then our definitions conflict meaning your paragraph quoted above and my paragraph here are both irrelevant.

&gt;Your counterargument in relation to the grades is flawed, as you are assuming that 5 is an average score, in the case of video game, a score of about 5/10 is not an average score, as the bar has been raised from the previously high grading of mediocre games as you show with the (x+2) argument.

I think you misunderstood my x+2 argument. Yes, the bar gets raised. This means that when you have an influx of games that might have deserved a 7/10 when comparing it to the previous average now become the average, meaning a 5/10. The average is not fixed and is, as the name suggests, the average quality of the games on the market. This means that a 5/10 is *always* the average and a 6/10 is *always* slightly above average. 

*Continued.*

"councilofkarma","t5_2wtuw","&gt;Something I suggested in modmail but will repeat here: The idea that skirmishes themselves last a certain amount of time. The amount of time a skirmish takes to resolve would be, say, 5 minutes per troop (min. 1 hour). Once resolved, the troops fighting in them would be freed up to fight elsewhere.

 Could you use this idea, and then, in order to clear unnecessary FOW, have the bot delete threads that have been resolved? That way there are 600+ threads or whatever, but just the active ones showing. Obviously this will prevent us actual humans from knowing who's winning, but there are fixes for this. You could implement a 

    score

command which would only show the VPs of each team gained in threads which the bot has resolved and deleted, sort of like in real war, where the generals already know they've won or lost previous skirmishes, but have trouble keeping up with the ongoing battle.","1372637873"

mtDna is a lineage marker passed from mother to child, it has nothing to do with genetic composition. U can be 99% of different race with different mtDNA. The first major marker/mutation is  mtDNA L literally assumed from to be single woman or first human human female and it is often called Eve named after mythological Eve. We all humans have that marker (there can be exception if they were able to preserve marker before L as far as I know there is not yet a person without L)

 The mtDNA marker M is generally considered a mutation from first wave of human migration out of Africa and it has branched out to several ones. It seems they first migrated to India via coast and spread   into various regions in Asia. People who descended from 1st wave will have M and its mutated into subgroup like M1,M48,C,Z etc. Indians estimated to have 60% M lineage. First we were negroid some people from current Bengal&amp;Bihar region somehow ended up in Adman and got isolated. If we assume they didn't face any evolutionary pressure, so they remained unchanged. The core group in mainland India evolved as Australoid and spread out, and some ended in Australia and got isolated. we continued evolve to build civilization but they remained same. M is found in most of Asia which literally  means we descended from from single female who lived very long time ago but we are not same some remained as negroid some evolved as Australoid, 'some to be mongoloid'. Like all humans have L, all first wave migrated people have M.The people from second wave come under N and its subgroups H,V,J,T commonly found among Europeans.
   
   There is another type of lineage Y-DNA passed male to male/father to son since males only carry Y-DNA, mtDNA by both. The alleged Aryan R1a1a is commonly found among Indians, Afghans and Eastern Europeans. Its found upto 50% in Indian higher castes and upto 70% among Bengali Brahmins. 

 In composition which is usually by analyzing autosomal DNA nearly all people in south asia have majority original gene pool but the Aryan invasion have major impact like we got Caucasian Skull, colored skin intensity varying on genetic composition. Muslim invasions are mostly from Aryan-Iranians, Afghan and Iran which slightly increased Aryan gene content among their descendants. Though Babur was Caucasian and mongoloid mix, he came with only 12k men of them most are Afghans and Iranians. Shah Jagan is 3/4th Indian or ~95% Indo-Iranian. Nearly all their descendants must be Muslims. In genetic analysis it is seen a large amount of foreign gene inflow around 1500 BC. Most of the external genes came from those invansions and followed huge wave of migration and additional gene flow from Aryan descendants like Kushans, Scythians etc. There is also considerable gene flow from East Asians i.e Burma,China in east side in Bengal and Bihar and south but not great extension. Since 'everyone' has more than 51% Indian original gene pool they are Indians. Even many castes in TN is also Indo-Aryans. The purest Indians can be isolated tribal people.

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","Hi, 
There are many other variables that will affect this decision such as; have you previously owned property? have you got existing exposure to property? how much excess cashflow have you got to fund a property that is untenanted? is it a new property? etc.

Simplistically, let's say you purchased a property for $350,000 and let's also assume that Stamp duties, mortgage application fees, conveyancing etc. all add up to an additional $10,000. So the total cost to acquire this property is now $360,000. If you used all of your savings $25,000 as a deposit, the required loan would be $335,000. 
Assuming an interest rate of 5.5%, the annual interest expense would be $18,425 and monthly expense of approximately $1,535. 
Most people would then compare the difference between owning $1,535 and renting $1,300 and evaluate whether the difference ($235) is worth paying to own a property.

Annually, the difference works out (in this example) to be $2,825. So if the house goes up by $2,825 or more, it is a good financial decision. 

When it comes to buying vs. renting vs. investment, it is always dependant on your personal financial circumstance. Sometimes people make bad structural decisions that lose them money and sometimes people make decisions that eventually lose them money due to unforeseen circumstances. e.g. if you bought a house that gets flooded, fire damage, termites, bad tenants, wind damage etc. it can all have a significant affect on your financial position.

Financial Planning is about understanding the potential financial consequences of your decisions and planning your pathway to your goal along the path you are most comfortable with. 

Also, try not to fall in the trap that property always goes up. Unfortunately, there are many people that have lost money in property in the past.

"iphone","t5_2qh2b","I came back because the iPhone 5 just seemed to get everything right.

I had the first 2 generations of the iPhone and initially it was great with the exception of leaving out a quality camera, good reception, a note pad and so on. I found myself with hardware envy for the most part, I wanted a better screen with more memory that was user replaceable, I wanted battery life and an openness to the OS that just wasn't there. Also, my AT&amp;T bill had finally broken the $100 dollar mark for unlimited everything (even though you couldn't use it because the 2G was the slowest data ever) and I just wasn't happy with my dollar to service ratio. So I left. 

I went to Sprint and picked up the bomb shit, that Evo 4G. Motherfucker it was fast. That camera, 1080p son! Screen size, 4.2 inches (which was big for the time) and that connection speed - WiMax (not that I had its service in my town, but there was a promise of better life on the horizon). I was in love...for about 2.5 hours, that is how long my epic battery life was....from a full charge. What the actual fuck. 

So I proceed to marry 3 chargers ones for work, car and home. Never mind that the phone got hot and had some light leak, never mind that the apps were, to quote from above,""shitty ports of iOS apps"" I mean the pandora app was a fuckin disgrace by comparison. All those things I could live with, it was the whack ass update schedule for the android platform. Apparently the original OS was then sent to each cell manufacturing company and each company then layered their own shit on top of factory android (fuckin HTC sense, I loathe you) so those new awesome updates were pushed back indefinitely. I got one on my Evo and one on my Photon. 

Things got better, I rooted and all that which actually showed me that a modded phone can be just as stable (which ultimately drove me to jailbreak my 5) but in the end, I got tired of waiting for what wasn't coming, support. Android is just too fragmented. There are how many different companies making android devices? Some are excellent, most are average.

My iPhone just works and now that it has many of the features I want (thanks evasion!), I am able to finally just enjoy my device. It's always got some battery life, it's easy on the eyes, doesn't crash and with the exception of my questionable Sprint service (finally getting 4G!) on occasion, I actually like using my phone. I believe that is a concept Apple holds near and dear (for the most part) and I find that was something I never really said about my androids. 

TL;DR - the 5 just works and makes me smile. ","1372637885"

"keto","t5_2rske","Keep it simple. Dead simple, at the beginning. Here are a few tips:

First of all...if you don't *have* to cook everything in one day...don't. That can be a daunting task with a new diet/lifestyle. But if you have to...

Focus your meals around simple components. Meat/Poultry/Fish and a Vegetable. 

Chicken tenderloins. Fry them up in a pan with butter until they're done, portion out into individual containers. Add salad fixings to another container. 

Ground beef. Cook it up and portion it out. 

Eggs - hard boil them. This makes them good for eating them whole, or slicing them for a cobb/chef salad. 

Don't let the components of food overwhelm you. Use MFP for tracking and preplanning and you'll have a great idea of how things will stack up. Just search for ""raw"" items, and that removes any of the variance concerning how they're prepared. If you add butter, then simply add that into the MFP meal, and you're set. Vegetables are easy. Steam them, or sautee them in butter. Get in the habit of weighing out cheese slices if you're eating off the block (getting in that habit is good for *everything*, by the way...). 

Bacon - in the oven, naturally. Keeps the mess way down, and you can cook a fair amount at a time. Crumble some up in a bag for ready made bacon bits for all the salads you're going to be eating. 

TLDR; Stop. Take a deep breath. Chill. And then plan with MFP using raw ingredients and cook. ","1372637886"

I personally would get a second opinion.. Get a company you choose to look at it. Might cost ya a $100, but will hopefully provide the info you are looking for.

A few things you can check, make sure the vents in all rooms are fully open. Don't have any closed vents. Even if you don't use the room.

If you're brave/handy enough, climb into the attic, and do a visual inspection of the ducting. Maybe it became disconnected somehow? If you're even more brave, open the AC unit in  the attic, and look for icing.. Another possibility is that you are low on freon (which you won't be able to check without special equipment.).. The icing or low freon should have been caught by the AC tech.

I'm excited to see what 8.1 will offer wp8 and plan on sticking with wp8 for a while. Its odd to say but iPhone users need to change certain habits to make wp8 work well... Hard to explain.All in all I just can't stand the iPhone anymore.  I can't think of anything new that works well that Apple has brought to the table in a long time.

"Civcraft","t5_2tm1t","So, you want no discussion, you will just be the final word on what should and should not be paid?

Ok, how is this:

Until I receive the compensation for the reparations I have decided I am owed (since that is pretty much what you have decided that you can do in this situation), I will continue to contribute coal to fund your imprisonment.  I will also use any influence I have in MinasMinas to make sure you stay in the vault.

During that time, each piece of coal that could be converted into charcoal (more charcoal, actually, but we will ignore that for now) is worth at least 128 XP (as I could run it through a diamond cauldron).  So, each coal that is eaten to imprison you is worth, to me, 128 XP.  I know one person buying 9 bottles of XP for 1d at his shop in Solis.  

Therefore, if you want a more exact accounting for reparations than the value of my armor and muh hurt feels, we will call each day that you have to remain imprisoned to be valued at 13 diamonds.

I shan't go into detail as I need to go to bed, but needless to say, any guy who thinks he has first dibs on any woman because he goes to the gym more is a fucking idiot and is going to spend a long time dating women who look like they've just arrived from the Dior counter (with corresponding two-inch thick foundation) until they realise that there's an awful lot more to attraction than just an instant carnal reaction.

I enjoy my culture and do not want to see it put to waste by some group that has some small disagreement. This does not mean we should bash other religions and allow for further persecution. However, the Ten Commandments is probably one of the most recognized Christian symbols, and America is in large part a Christian country. We need to celebrate our culture, not try and tear it down.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","I lived in Israel for about two years. Came back to Australia for financial reasons. Is there racism in Israel? Yes. Just as there's racism in every country. That being said a great deal of the racism against Arabs comes from the threat of terror. People have experienced it daily, seen their friends die in terror attacks or wounded in battle. This, of course, gives people a certain mindset when it comes to how best to define their 'enemy'. 

There's most certainly racism against Arabs and Palestinians from the religious settler community. In the many interactions that I had with them they viewed their relationship with their neighbours as one of interlopers, that the Palestinians had taken over their biblical homeland and that the Jews were now reclaiming their houses. 

Do I think that we should give up the West Bank and East Jerusalem? I think that it's inevitable. Even Netanyahu was rumoured the other day to be contemplating giving up up to 90% of the West Bank for a peace deal. When it comes to East Jerusalem I think that you'll have a great deal more difficulty in convincing people to give that up. It plays such a central role in Jewish life....but I guess we'll see.

Maybe on /r/im14andthisisfunny  but I don't think I've seen a vagina referenced on /r/AdviceAnimals or /r/funny during the year and a half I've been here, excepting the current post or posts made by women about periods, etc. 

But please, tell me how the reddit experience is changed by the ownership of different genitalia, because as far as I can tell, for every /r/gonewild, there's an /r/ladybonersgw. If I may, quote from their page: 
""Welcome to Ladyboners Gone Wild. This is a place for guys on reddit to strut their stuff."" 

Now replace the words ""strut their stuff"" with ""throw out your genitalia so we can discuss and potentially mock it"". 

Remember that reddit is a self fulling prophecy. If you subscribe to certain subreddits, you WILL see certain things. If you only subscribe to /r/politics, you would imagine reddit as being incredibly political. That being said, there *are* sexist subreddits, and some users even, and if you subscribe to those, you will think reddit as a whole is, but like many commentators on this thread have said, I simply haven't noticed *any* content mocking someone for simply being a woman, and if I had seen that, I would've been as offended as you, because it's an insult to the intelligence of not only those being mocked, but those who the content was published to, as if we would accept such sentiments.

In an industry like this (Or anywhere really) you'll never please everyone. And I don't think it's about having 'guts'. I think it's more along the lines that DC had a significantly (at least in their eyes) poor reader reaction to a *very* simple costume change. So with that experience, would it be better to further change her costume and just hope for the best? Or revert back to a costume that the majority of readers seem to be at least okay with... and continue to pay money for the book so it doesn't get cancelled?

Google play is getting better all the time, but at the end of the day, it comes out first on IOS and I was sick of waiting, and there's so many apps that never make it to android at all. I don't miss android one little bit. ","1372637906"

How do you figure that? Given no restrictions on the numbers of each coins, there are a lot of very simple solutions if the question is asking you to figure out what combinations of coins David paid with. 

For instance each of the following works and is trivial to work out:

* 30 $2 coins, total $60

* 12 $5 coins, total $60

* 10 $2 coins and 8 $5 coins, total $60

Since it's for an 8 year old a test of being able to divide or multiply is probably appropriate and non-trivial, but it doesn't require any knowledge of currencies or any math other than multiplication.","1372637915"

It's not so awesome that she seems to be so hung up on the idea of you both as a couple that she doesn't recognize that she deserves more, and that so do you.

My ex did not have the courtesy to tell me this.  She was not in love with me and never was, and I ultimately spent four years thinking I was investing a ridiculous amount of time and money and emotion into something mutual.

Seeing her have those feelings for someone else along the end of things was ridiculously destructive for me.  And I imagine that if you settled for this girl, those emotions that you find in other women are going to build up at some point, and even if you don't cheat on her, it will ultimately cause resentment between the both of you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh god this is a touchy subject. I worked in the restaurant industry for 16 years of my life. My grandpa owned a restaurant when I was young, so I basically grew up in it. 

In those 16 years I've had 6 total walk-outs personally. 

In the corporate restaurant world (depends on the company) it is your responsibility to always be available for the guest when they need you. Regardless of the level of attentiveness, it is always your responsibility to cash out the table. WHICH MEANS if someone dines and dashes, the server pays for it. No exaggeration, it has happened to me more times than not that I personally have to fork over my tips at the end of the night to pay for their meal. This is also dependent on how much of an ass your manager is as well.

I had a family of five order a huge meal with appetizers, entrees, etc. didn't think twice. When they ordered dessert and I went back to make it they up and left. True story. I had already had a walkout per the restaurant's policy first one is paid by the company, so I paid for this table's $115 tab. I didn't make $115 dollars that night so I had to pull $25 out of my wallet at the end of the night. Complete crap.

My favorite walkout (if there is such a thing) was two old ladies. I don't think they were malicious with their intentions, probably both thinking the other had paid since they split a bottle of wine and were a bit tipsy. But boy I didn't see that coming at all. I found it more funny than anything. 

Final story, not mine, but one of our male big burly bartenders chased this guy down the street for his $75 bar tab, and got beat up by the dude who was half his size. He went to the hospital with a broken jaw. 

TL;DR: Don't Dine 'n' Dash, the servers often have to pay out of their pocket for your tab. I've paid about $500 in tabs for the walkouts.


**EDIT:** According to the research done by /u/mr_indigo below it is **LEGAL** to have the server pay for the walkout tab. His findings: it is associated with the legality of tip credits - its only illegal to charge the employee if that would take them below the federal minimum wage, and you cannot include tips in that count since tips are the property of the employee and not the employer. (consumerist.com) Washington State minimum (and server) wage: $9.19, Federal Minimum Wage: $7.25

**2nd EDIT** I'm not not here to debate its legality. There are thousands of places that still make servers pay for the walkouts, and I'm no longer in the industry. So apparently if your employer is making you pay for walkouts you should talk to The Department of Labor. I just wanted to tell some stories!","1372637924"

People are part of a whole and to view it as anything else is simply incorrect.  However, the tradeoff between living a holistic and compassionate life (taking the earth and other into account) vs living in the zeitgeist involves giving up what many have been conditioned to desire.

However, my viewpoint from this is that if you were to watch .999 scroll across an infinitely sized screen, there would at no point at which the nines suddenly stopped and became zeros, making the number 1.000.  While they may have the 'same' value, they physically are different numbers.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; If that were the case you would not have quoted and labelled by statement about who has more authority to define freedom as drivel.

You framed the discussion in terms of ""authority,"" not me. My experiences with those immediately jump to the question who has ""authority"" to define concepts have been uniformly bad, because it's almost always brought up by people who seem convinced that theology is nothing more than a baseless appeal to authority.

&gt; I don't imagine you making a very good professor.

My student evaluations say otherwise, thankfully. Luckily, my students don't see me as an enemy that they have to one-up, and they don't see the theology I teach as something they have to prove wrong at all costs. That makes them infinitely more bearable than most of the atheists hanging out in Internet religion forums.

&gt; A hostile tone is not stating that you don't have any more authority to determine what freedom means than I.

A hostile tone is immediately turning this into a dispute about authority. I merely stated what Christians tend to believe about the freedom of Adam and Eve to sin or not sin, and you immediately turned this into some kind of authority conflict.

&gt; There are thousands or millions of theologians who start with different definitions than you and come to somewhat different conclusions about the nature of Jesus.

And I'm just stating what the general position is. I'm not pretending to speak for *every* theologian ever. But the overwhelming opinion among Christian theologians is that the reason Jesus didn't sin is that Jesus is God, not that Jesus had some kind of special human nature that somehow couldn't sin.

&gt; A great number of theologians state that, as a human, he was free to sin but his nature was such that he would never chose to.

A great number of theologians *do not* say this. Who specifically do you have in mind here? The idea that Jesus' humanity was somehow special in a such a way that he had the power to sin but couldn't actually choose to isn't really the mainstream position, I'm afraid. The mainstream position states that the human will ""follows"" the divine will because there is no human person that is separate from the divine person. The idea of Christ's humanity choosing against his divinity is basically incoherent on the mainstream, creedal understanding of Christ. I'm sorry if I haven't accounted for every possible non-creedal account that's existed.

&gt; It makes absolutely no sense to say you tempted someone with sin such as Satan did with Jesus when there is no possibility of any choice involved.

This is indeed a tricky issue in Christology, but your solution--saying that somehow Jesus had the power to sin but his nature was such that he would never choose to--doesn't in any way solve the problem. If Jesus' nature was such that he would never choose to sin, then he was no more tempted than if we say that he didn't sin because he was God.

According to the mainstream account, it was Jesus' humanity that was tempted, but the reason he ddin't give in to the temptation is that his human will is the will of a divine person and as such is subordinate to the divine will. This is not a solution without problems that theologians have to work out, but your assertion that Jesus' *humanity* is such that it would somehow never choose to sin is not at all a widespread position.","1372637935"

To put it simply, you don't masturbate to touch your dick(vag) you do it because it feels good during, and eventually it feels even better. Even when it starts to chafe.

Edit: again, I'm not really focusing on lol, but what you've described isn't a pay-to-win or an addictive reward system, it's just a means to reward frequent use over infrequent.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","From _Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage, Second Edition_ (1985) by William and Mary Morris: 
late The use of _late_ in referring to a person recently deceased has been standard since before Columbus made his first trip to the New World. There is no precise time element involved in determining how long a person must be dead before he is no longer considered _late_. As a general rule, _late_ is used in reference to persons whose death has occurred within the twenty or thirty years just past. On the other hand, it is proper for an elderly person to refer to a contemporary who has preceded him in death as ""the _late_."" 
---------- 
From _Webster's Dictionary of English Usage_ (1989): 
late Much thought has been given to the use of _the late_ before the name of a dead person. The most frequently considered aspect of such use is just how long a person referred to as ""the late"" can have been dead. Here are a few opinions: 
""... the statute of limitations might run for half a century"" --Bernstein 1971 
""As a general rule, late is used in reference to persons whose death has occurred within the twenty or thirty years just past"" --Harper 1975 
""... 'the late' is used for about ten to fifteen years after death"" --Safire 1984 
What everyone does agree on is that there is no hard and fast rule to be followed. Our evidence shows that _the late_ can be applied to people whose lives were recent enough to exist at any point within the living memory of the writer or speaker. You should use your own judgment to decide whether it is appropriate in a particular instance. ","1372637946"

My ears might be deceiving me but it I think the entire thing was done on synthesizers. If so - I assume it was done to avoid new use fees. 

I learned that term the other day at Carter Burwell's website. 
He does music for the Coen brothers.

&gt; There are a number of reasons scores don't get released on CD. The primary one is that the release on CD of a film score that was recorded by a union orchestra requires the musicians to be paid ""new use"" fees (because this is a new use of music that was originally intended for film). 
&gt;
&gt; For an orchestra these fees can be quite large, dwarfing any other expenses, and making it difficult to recoup a CD's costs. These problems have caused many composers and producers to record their scores non-union, and in response to this ""runaway"" production the union (the AFM) has changed its calculation of new use fees so they are less onerous.

I got a big zit the other day, applied my treatment this morning and it's flattened out almost completely by this evening.

Tea tree on its own doesn't do the same without the addition of neem. I'm considering trying neem full strength tonight to see how it does. Word of caution, neem smells like rank chicken ramen seasoning. So if you're sensitive to smells, you might want to stick to a 2.5% BP cream. ","1372637964"

I know most of you have never and will never see combat, or lose friends to war, but these men (and a few adorable women too!) come to see something for them and the sacrifices they and their buddies made to stop the spread of fascism.  The signs are there so people will respect what was built; that is all.  It's not stamping out your freedom and oppressing you.  It's the same as the signs at Arlington reminding you to keep quiet and ponder what each and every one of the souls laid to rest there did for you.

I know that if and when a memorial is built for the war I fought in, and the war in which my buddies died, I will want to see it not all mucked up by people who don't think twice about what it means to myself and my friends.

For one, both of those matches (Argentina and Portugal) were friendlies, and were right after winning the World Cup, so motivation was fairly low compared to tonight. Also, this is largely still the same squad as it's been for this whole run, so their players (noticeably Xavi) are starting to show their age and lack of ability to recover from matches so quickly. They have fantastic players waiting in reserve, but still there has to be a transition at some point. Also, due to Barcelona's recent thrashing being so fresh in the memory, a lot of parallels can be made since so many of their squad is in the Spain squad.

This is just one match, Spain are still the best in the world, but this will definitely be worrying for them. ","1372637969"

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","I'll concede that what we think of characterization is a recent development in myths and even some storytelling. I do think, however, that the very form in this case - what might be considered a socially realistic approach despite the fantastic setting - implies an approach to traditional characterization. These characters may not be as full and rich as those of *Anna Karenina*, and they need not be so for the movie to work, but their actions should *make internal sense*, and this I think is a necessity, unless we're playing games with the form itself - that Homer Simpson has life changing experiences each episode and then reverts to his original character by the next episode is an acknowledged joke in the series. I pick an example for the idea of internal sense, even in the mythic, even from the fantastic, from something very well-known - after Darth Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father, he tells his son that his only choice is to join him - and Luke instead falls to his possible death. 

However fantastic the setting, however simplistic the characters, we understand him in this moment - he is overwhelmed with despair at what has been revealed, and no longer has the will to live. I compare that to those on the ship at the end of *Prometheus* who suddenly decide to sacrifice themselves without argument - I accept the idea that these characters care little for each other, but given that they care so little for each other, they accept Shaw's word without question. They care so little for each other, yet somehow their love for humanity is so boundless, and they are so selfless, that they are willing to die without urging. To my mind, this isn't non-traditional characterization so much as sloppy writing.","1372637976"

Another thing I've noticed is the use of the word ""institutionalized"" for a lot of -isms.

Plenty of them claim to be in college or have college educations.

"Yogscast","t5_2sg86","(Part 2/2)

I think the way scores are given is like this: You take the pinnacle of a genre, in this case, Dungeon Keeper. You then proceed to compare your game to that game and you list what it does correctly, where it achieves the pinnacle’s glory and where it doesn’t. Then you see how that list fits in today’s market and you grade it accordingly. This means you compare your game with that pinnacle but grade in comparison to today’s market. This means a Game of Dwarves did some things right/ok in comparison to Dungeon Keeper and some things wrong and because a lot of dungeon management games on today’s market did a lot of things wrong (Looking at you, Impire), the game is graded above average which in this case means it’s a mediocre game, since the average quality wasn’t that high to begin with. This means the game might be mediocre but still quite good compared to today’s market and still worth your money if you desperately want a dungeon management game.

Just on a side note, I too think the rating of videogames is fundamentally flawed because the rating depends on the time and market the videogames were released in. That’s why I don’t acknowledge the rating of a video game, I just read the review itself and base an opinion on that. I just used the Metacritic score in my first post to give a quick indication of what professional reviewers thought about the game. I don’t think Metacritic is an accurate or good review site though.

&gt;In regards to the whole premise of 6/10 being a good score for a dungeon keeper, this may be the case, however, an individual may find this game to be particularly poor or good according to their taste, in this case Lewis didn't like the game, and thus stated so, the objective categories which he is judging it by are his personal preferences. He called it a ""terrible game"", which means that it is a terrible game in his opinion.

Yep, he called it a terrible game and he’s allowed to think that. The point I was trying to make was that his personal preferences don’t match up with objective review criteria. His opinion isn’t worth anything when it comes to objectively evaluating the quality of a game because those criteria don’t match up. I should nuance though, his opinion is worth as much as any other gamer’s opinion. It’s obvious you know this, I know this and I’m certain he knows it yet other people might not. They might think Lewis’ personal opinion is an accurate representation of the quality of a videogame because he has played a lot of video games and because he does something on the Internet with video games and is successful with it. However, in my opinion, these things don’t equal the knowledge to accurately grade a video game’s quality. Let’s take a ridiculous example, I have been sick a lot of times already. That doesn’t mean I possess any knowledge to self-diagnose myself though.

&gt;If you were in an art gallery with someone and they called a painting ugly, regardless of an objective opinion of the art, they are obviously projecting a subjective opinion of the art, its short hand for saying ""this painting is ugly in my opinion"". Nobody in their right mind would expect Lewis to give anything other than a personal opinion in such circumstances.

Correct, however, they key difference here is that someone in an art gallery doesn’t influence buying behaviour in any way. Bluexephos has 5 million subscribers, that is 5 million people that can potentially take Lewis’ own personal opinion as an accurate representation of the game’s quality, which means it will influence their buying behaviour. This could impact sales both in a positive way (for example, a lot of people bought Minecraft because they had watched Yogscast videos) and in a negative way, which could ruin a development studio. Now we both know that not every Yogscast subscriber could/would take Lewis’ personal opinion as an accurate representation of a game’s quality but even 1% of that could break a small development studio and that’s not even counting the negative advertising by word of mouth done by that 1%.

&gt;The core of my argument is that people sharing their opinion leads to discussion and in no circumstance should people have to worry about whether to share their opinion out of fear that somebody could be influenced to act upon their personal opinion. A public figure should not feel they can't share their political opinions out of fear that someone might blindly stick to them because of their stature. Sharing opinions is good in creating discussion and if anyone feels they should not share their opinion for any reason it causes disparity in their discussion. What Lewis said was entirely about his personal opinion, and anyone's personal opinion and experiences should be allowed the affect anyone's choices in accordance to who they chose to listen to and why. 

I agree that sharing opinions leads to good discussion. Also, I know you didn’t mean anything by it but we weren’t talking about political opinions. I agree that everyone should be able to express a *political* opinion without fear of retribution or negative consequences. However, I disagree that anyone can share their own personal opinion on everything without nuance or disclaimer; especially not when we’re talking about something as ordinary as videogames and when a large chunk of your audience is around 12-13 years old, when they can’t necessarily see the difference between a personal opinion and an accurate representation of a video game’s quality. That is why I said he has to be careful, because he expressed his opinion without any disclaimer while his audience is young and easily influenced. If you disagree completely with this last point then there is no point in continuing this conversation since we’ll both keep hammering on our own opinions over and over and over again.

&gt;In order to protect people from wrongly valuing the opinions of others because of their stature, we should not prevent them from stating their opinions, or warn them from doing so, we should ensure that people know why to value an opinion and how to seek out meaning in why they have that opinion, the idea that people should not hear the opinions of others out of fear that they might assign wrongful value to the opinions.

This, I wholeheartedly agree with this. However, I think a large chunk of the Yogscast’s audience doesn’t know how to value an opinion. And I know I’m repeating myself here but that is why I said he has to be careful with expressing his opinion or phrasing it the way he did. I think that when dealing with people who don’t know how to value an opinion, it’s up the one expressing it to make sure people and those people specifically can understand his opinion the way it’s meant to be understood, which Lewis didn’t do at all.

&gt;Finally, the idea that all professional reviewers express their opinion completely objectively is completely flawed, if that was the case you'd only ever have to read one review about a game before knowing whether you want to invest in it or otherwise. All reviewers will let their personal opinion affect their reviews of the game and that is why reading many reviews gives more of an insight into the flavour of a game. A sensible person should be expected to take many opinions and reviews, in addition to their own personal tastes and their knowledge of the game itself before investing in a game. 

Don’t necessarily agree. I think one good review is enough to determine a game’s worth. The more, the merrier, of course but one good review is enough. You should really only need a list of a game’s mechanics and whether they work or not within the game (+ reasons why, of course), which a good review will do, and knowledge about any crippling problems with the game (bugs, excessive DRM, server issues), which any review will do. You should be able to figure out for yourself whether you agree with the explanation offered or whether you are able to overlook a game’s problems. You should be able to make an informed purchase armed with this information in my opinion.

&gt;In this case, all Lewis has done is called a game terrible, which isn't going to turn the heads of many sensible people, however, the views of any Yogscast member, when expanded on, as well as any information that has been obtained from a video/podcast on their network, can be reasonably expected to be used when someone makes a decision as to whether someone should invest in a game, I myself have used information I have got from videos on the Yogscast network when deciding to buy games such as Minecraft and Fallout 3, as plenty of valid rationale of the views of Yogscast members, as well as the solid information that can be obtained from their videos is just as valid as the rationale of any professional reviewer in regards to purchasing a game provided the reasoning is sound. 

**Big emphasis on “sensible”** Rule X of the Internet: Assume everyone on the Internet is an idiot. Yes, you are allowed to use their opinion when making a decision about whether you buy something or not. The worth of their opinion is only as much as the opinion of any other gamer though, it’s not a representation of the quality of a game. I mean, yeah sure, you can value their opinion as highly as you want. You can value any opinion as highly as you want for all I care. It’s just that you won’t be making an informed decision if you only rely on their opinion because as I said, they can dislike good games and like bad games.


Urgh, glad that’s done. Conclusion: I think we struck a golden mean (that’s an expression, right?) in the end? At least our opinions didn’t clash as much as in the end. :)

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Nothing you buy while you are out at the client site will make your experience much better.  You could make sandwiches in your hotel room or eat at expensive restaurants but after a while it will all seem normal and barely register as fun in your brain.  You'll be tempted to spend a bunch of money while you are out, but trust me that it's not really going to much of a difference.  By all means, get some fancy dinners but do it in moderation so that the experience is more fun.

You'll only be home on weekends, so buying a house would be kinda silly.  You might even choose to just sleep in a hotel, although being without a ""home"" might be tough psychologically.

Speaking of which - becoming a minimalist might be rather useful for you.  For the most part you'll be unable to use your stuff 90% of the time anyways, perhaps you could reduce your belongings to what fits in a suitcase.  That would completely free you from the need to rent a place or be attached to a particular city.

See what's flexible about your expenses.  Can you fly to a different city than your home?  Can you stay there for the weekend and pocket the difference?  Will they pay for your hotel over the weekend if you don't want to fly home?  Will they rent a place for you so you don't need to live in a hotel?  It's possible that you could spend all your weekends in different cities having a blast.

How long do you think you'll last?  I'd do your best to avoid spending gobs of money because traveling gets old quick.  It's hard to date, get married, have kids, etc when you are on the road all the time.  It's great when you are single but eventually you'll probably want something more stable.  I advise you to pretend that you are making something less ridiculous like $50k per year and just auto transfer the rest into investments.  Honestly, you could be retired in 5 years or so if you like while living a middle class lifestyle.

For investments - read The Bogleheads Guide to Investing.  The [wiki](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_Started) has some good info, but I really recommend the book.  You'll want to max your 401k and look into backdoor Roth IRA deposits.  You'll also need to learn more than you ever wanted to know about [capital gains taxation](http://fairmark.com/books/cgmt.htm).  That book is rather dry, but it should save you heaps of money over your lifetime.  In general, you'll want to place your investments where they'll be the most [tax efficient](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_Tax-Efficient_Fund_Placement) and Bogleheads will help you there.

I also recommend being active on the Bogleheads forum.  Those guys are very good at paying very little in taxes and dealing with the issues related to having a high income or a lot of wealth.","1372637983"

What? In the scientific literature transmutations are well documented for LENR (Cold Fusion). Lighter elements combine to produce heavier ones.

Here is a library of a thousand papers on Cold Fusion research: http://lenr-canr.org/

The excess heat, well beyond that of chemical reactions, is ""something which we can see"". So your comments are incorrect on all fronts.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","WOW. Lets see if I can respond to some of this.
I have 2 children, and did not experience any of the following: excessive weight gain (you don't feel fat when you are pregnant, just a bit unbalanced - your stomach is firm, not jiggly), stretch marks (get a good cream, eat well, they may be minimal if at all), chloasma, morning sickness, gestational diabetes, amniocentecis  (no needles in the amniotic fluid). 

Many of the things you are afraid of can be avoided or minimized by having a good relationship with a good doctor you trust. You may want to get help from a dietician, as s/he can help you plan meals to keep your weight gain on track and your food intake healthy. I swam laps up until about a week before giving birth - made me feel great, and kept me in shape.

As far as finding out there is something wrong, that's life. Any of us could find out this week that we have a terrible disease....life is too short to expend much time entertaining these concerns. If you do have a medical phobia yet you and your partner decide you want to have children, you might think about talking with a counselor - you can get help in working through your concerns, and I believe your partner would help as well.

As far as child birth - educate yourself, then make a decision. I initially thought of having my children at home, but then found a wonderful birthing center where my husband stayed on a foldout bed in the room and the baby stayed in the room the whole time (never left, at all). We ended up choosing this option because we talked to doctors and friends and decided we did not want to be an hour from a hospital if we (the baby or I) needed help (this was our fear - everyone has different fears). Everyone has anxieties about having children. What you want to do is find a doctor (a family practitioner or ob/gyn) or midwife with whom you are comfortable, talk all this out, and then make some decisions. 

You will not be going through this alone - it sounds like you have a great partner, he can help if you let him.

And, as for sex afterwards - personally (and I have friends that say the same thing), sex is better after (maybe not the first time or two, because one or both of you are worried about it, but after a couple of weeks, it's better than before).

Compared to the number of games that feature male protagonists, the number of games that feature female protagonists is pretty small. It's hardly a surprise women haven't come out ""in droves"" to shell out hundreds of dollars on a system to play three or four of the games with female protagonists that appeal to them.

&gt; That certainly isn't very scientific is it. Are you a gamer yourself, or do you just interview the gamers you ""come into contact with"" about the pros and cons of each game they play?

I'm saying that to assume that everyone acts as you do is a dire mistake. To wander blithely through life as though you are the only person with an opinion that matters is a terrible and harmful way to go. 

What occurs when someone offends you? Do you then take the stance that you are right and they are wrong or do you see that you did the same to someone else? I don't care about 9/11 but I'm sure many people here do. I believe it to be a bloated excuse for a continuing war. If I was to go and lay on or eat on the 9/11 memorial that would offend a great many people here. But I don't care about 9/11 and realize that some people do; they would wish that I respect that memorial. I understand that and that is my point. Just think about how your actions could affect other people.

Understand that you are not the only person that matters. Understand that the memorial isn't for you to bathe in. It is to respect the dead.","1372638000"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","But what you don't seem to realise is that it takes time to moderate rules. And having consistent policy across the board makes such moderation much easier, and much less prone to error. It's not an unreasonable policy, but it will be a lot less frustrating for all involved if it's not on a publisher-by-publisher basis. 

We're much more likely to have an error if we fail to properly note the publisher. This could result in posts that don't break your suggested version  being removed, or posts that do break it not being removed. 

Not just that but even if everything went perfectly, we'd still likely have people say ""why did my post get removed, and not his?"". Then, what about if another publisher expresses the same desire. Now we have to update the policy and be ever vigilant in case another publisher does the same. 

We have to balance what we want to achieve with the practicalities of achieving it. That makes a blanket policy, independent of the publisher, the workable one. ","1372638003"

"halo","t5_2qixk","I disagree. The Halo 3 ranking system made the game too competitive as your rank was determined by how well you did in matches. If you were a high rank and then had one or two poor matches, you invariably lost that rank. This drove casual players like me insane because the hardcore folk would make everyone feel bad when they were on the losing side. I remember quite vividly dealing with a rank 80 on my team during a match who went on a rage-rant saying that those who ""suck at the game shouldn't even play"". This was a huge turn-off for me, as I didn't have anywhere near his skills at the time, and let's face it, no one  likes being told they're ""bad"" at a videogame. Secondly, this ranking system rewarded those who cheated the system. I remember a match where a friend and I were placed with a guy and his three guests in a 3 vs. 3 gametype. I was generally the better player and would kill 2 of them for every one of my deaths, but the other team was winning. Why was that? because the third guest(who was on my team) kept killing himself... My friend and I only won that one because at one point the suicidal third guest killed himself with a rocket-launcher to the ground while my friend was standing nearby, killing him as well, and we booted the lot for betrayal. So overall I feel that the Halo 3 ranking system should not come back.

And it's not like you can't get that from video games or movies or any other form of art. Of course you can, and in fact I love video games. But there's something about being immersed in your character, and in a fictional world, that allows you to really -- even if subconsciously -- deal with your fears, fantasies, inner demons, and inner-self.

This can even be seen (in a way) with Apple's iOS betas. iOS7 was made available for developers so they can update their apps or find bugs, members of the public got to download it (not the intention. some people even bought developer accounts (100$/year) just to get it), and they're leaving bad reviews on apps because they don't work right on iOS7.

Not really incentives, but I don't trust someone to sign off on a legally binding paper unless I do it myself. If they make a mistake, my name is on the arrest paperwork too and I could take a hit for it. It is more of a protecting myself thing.

&gt;Wait, wait, wait.

&gt;So, NYPD puts uniforms on a particular area, and if they say, bag a guy trying to snatch people's phones as they exit a station - - then they just don't dedicate personnel to that area until it gets noticeably bad again? 

They may bag a guy snatching phones, or a guy drinking who has a warrant. There aren't enough cops to fill his spot if he is off the street.

&gt;How would you implement a system that rewarded being eyes and ears and assigning arrests and giving good credit to assigned/arresting officers, that would also allow for, I dunno - low intensity deployment - all over the traditionally troubled areas? 

No idea.

&gt;Is it really a manpower thing? 

Absolutely.

&gt;What about taking cops from precincts that really don't see very much crime? 

They already do that on a daily basis, but it is more for reactive reasons than proactive ones. In a day you'll see cars all over the 67 with the turret lights on because they just took a shooting.

&gt;I'm sure there are crimes ranging from what you call violations/quality of life up to really awful shit happening in Chelsea from time to time....but probably nowhere near as often as the Bronx - - would redistributing officers help, or would it just push crime around?


Just push it around, really. Honestly, even with 34,000 uniforms we are still dealing with over 4,000,000 radio runs a year and 8.5 million people in this city. The manpower is always going to be the problem until the communities help themselves. We can only catch the criminals, we can't transform an area. Parents need to take better care of their kids.

I'm vaguely libertarian myself so I'm not knocking him for that, and the guy can make me laugh on occasion.

However, on an episode of *Who Do You Think You Are?* he found out that he was related to a man called John Kilner, who invented the kilner jar and made fortune from it. One of his factories happened to be situated near the countryside, which was owned by the Earl of Scarborough, who complained that Kilner's smoke was killing his trees and destroying his crops. 

400 people lost their jobs, which is very sad, however the fact remains it was the Earl of Scarborough's property Kilner was damaging and, if you're familiar with libertarianism, he had every right to have it closed down. The entire segment Clarkson bitches on about the woes envrionmentalism, and stated whining like the ""lefties"" he so decries.","1372638028"

God's compassion.  All those amazing stars and planets that we can see with our naked eyes?  God is encouraging us to be curious and explore.  

Even in the non-natural world...Every medical breakthrough that saves millions of lives is the work of God.  The ability to harness electricity and the internet and the ability to make buildings over 1000 feet tall...all of that is God.

Nobody created God, and He wasn't always here and won't always be here.  In fact, He isn't even a ""he.""  It evolved along with this planet and with you and me.  Basically, ""God"" is just the sum of all the good and hope and beauty and compassion in the world.","1372638028"

I simply stated that their intelligence agency is likely doing things that it wouldn't want publicized as they are likely similar to what is being done in the U.S.  Signals Intelligence and Human Intelligence are messy businesses which the majority of the world is involved in.  While I have no proof that Germany is doing any of this, I would simply point to the fact that they conduct Signals Intelligence as to the fact they are doing something close.  Additionally, you have no idea what sort of negotiations are going on right now or coming up which Germany may be trying to posture for.  By posture, I mean giving themselves a bargaining chip by saying they will stop making noise about the US if some concessions are made or if the US pays a larger percentage.  International affairs and espionage are both dirty businesses with so many seemingly disconnected events having a huge role in the overall process.

I am not grasping at straws and I have never referred to anyone as my ""Dear Leader"".  

Additionally, I would like to highlight a post from /u/cryptovariable in regards to the Germans charging the UK and the US and how preposterous it is.

You had a good fishing story ? His was better. You bought a good bottle of scotch ? His was more expensive. You had a good story about hooking up with a girl ? That was nothing, Ol' Ben had something to top it. He was full of shit, and we knew it and ran with it because we couldn't do anything but laugh at him, no one called him out because we wanted to see how far he could push the stuff he said.  On top of that, he was such a shitty salesman with absolutely no knowledge of the stuff he sold to people (mountaineering's pretty dangerous, you better know what you're talking about when it comes to gear).

It doesn't need to be an outright moral tale, you can have morally ambiguous arcs it's just easy to write simple morals. Your hothead character learns to be more reserved and calm, someone learns to get over their EX, stuff like that.","1372638033"

(""It's all one,"" says the Sapper),
The Lord He created the Engineer,
Her Majesty's Royal Engineer,
With the rank and pay of a Sapper!

When the Flood come along for an extra monsoon,
'Twas Noah constructed the first pontoon 
To the plans of Her Majesty's, etc.

But after fatigue in the wet an' the sun,
Old Noah got drunk, which he wouldn't ha' done 
If he'd trained with, etc.

When the Tower o' Babel had mixed up men's bat,
Some clever civilian was managing that,
An' none of, etc.

When the Jews had a fight at the foot of a hill,
Young Joshua ordered the sun to stand still,
For he was a Captain of Engineers, etc.

When the Children of Israel made bricks without straw,
They were learnin' the regular work of our Corps,
The work of, etc.

For ever since then, if a war they would wage,
Behold us a-shinin' on history's page - 
First page for, etc.

We lay down their sidings an' help 'em entrain,
An' we sweep up their mess through the bloomin' campaign,
In the style of, etc.

They send us in front with a fuse an' a mine 
To blow up the gates that are rushed by the Line,
But bent by, etc.

They send us behind with a pick an' a spade,
To dig for the guns of a bullock-brigade
Which has asked for, etc.

We work under escort in trousers and shirt,
An' the heathen they plug us tail-up in the dirt,
Annoying, etc.

We blast out the rock an' we shovel the mud,
We make 'em good roads an' - they roll down the khud,
Reporting, etc.

We make 'em their bridges, their wells, an' their huts,
An' the telegraph-wire the enemy cuts,
An' it's blamed on, etc.

An' when we return, an' from war we would cease,
They grudge us adornin' the billets of peace,
Which are kept for, etc.

We build 'em nice barracks - they swear they are bad,
That our Colonels are Methodist, married or mad,
Insultin', etc.

They haven't no manners nor gratitude too,
For the more that we help 'em, the less will they do,
But mock at, etc.

Now the Line's but a man with a gun in his hand,
An' Cavalry's only what horses can stand,
When helped by, etc.

Artillery moves by the leave o' the ground,
But we are the men that do something all round,
For we are, etc.

I have stated it plain, an' my argument's thus 
(""It's all one,"" says the Sapper),
There's only one Corps which is perfect - that's us;
An' they call us Her Majesty's Engineers,
Her Majesty's Royal Engineers,
With the rank and pay of a Sapper!

I'm probably going to track official season points too, but to do that either they need to add it to the API or I have to write something to scrape it from their list all the time. 

I can tell which season races are in, so adding the ability to filter/display only specific seasons/awards could definitely be added as well. My idea was to give you a reason to keep playing and increasing your stats, so I wanted to show you things like that Goratha and Kripp have won over a hundred races each. Wouldn't be too hard to just have a season select/dropdown option though if you are only interested in current season (kind of like how I do sorting on the ""races"" page). ","1372638034"

The reason I use the exact same facts, but change the context so that it's an exchange between cis people first, is because our culture seems to deem it okay and even necessary to know what trans genitals look like.

Make sure she knows it will not be a dating/romantic relationship and that you really enjoy her company as a friend. 

Advice: Don't go to the movies with ""Ella"" if you bring your friends along. If your friends harass you about ""Ella"" be vague and brush it off. They know nothing about how awesome she is and there is nothing wrong with having a friendship with a 14 year old, as long as it doesn't cross over into anything inappropriate. Oh, and have fun.

So, yeah, if somebody is writing ""u"" in an essay or a place where formal language is expected, then it is irritating.

However, I text ""u"" because it is more efficient and an informal setting (in most cases).

I teach my students that they should be able to determine when it is appropriate to use formal language, as well as informal language.

The problem is that a lot of people aren't taught about when it is appropriate to use this type of informal language. So, if this were my post, that would be what I want to get off my chest.","1372638038"

The result is that Miami natives like myself cannot walk into a a bar or a SubWay or a veterinarians office and just get what I need without having to delve into MY second language (I speak Spanish quite well). Having employees who speak English is not a necessity, and that's just ridiculous for any business operating in a major American city.

Everything you brought up, without exception, was an issue *before* the 2012 election.  Would you like to know why Obama was re-elected?  Because there weren't enough voters who cared enough about them to make a viable primary challenge, and with every problem you have with Obama, Republicans would just make them worse.  Why haven't there been any Wall Street prosecutions?  Because there aren't enough voters out there who are clamoring for them.

My whole point isn't that what Obama or anyone else does is right or wrong, but that if you want to change anything, you have to have enough people who want that change to go out and vote for it.  The tea party was smart enough to realize that, why aren't you?","1372638047"

I went on a trip recently, so listened to some classic/neoclassic albums on the long plane rides. Love all of those projects to death. (College Dropout, Donuts, GKMC)

**Yeezus** - Fucking love the album man. The only track I dislike is I Am a God. 8/10 for me.

**Born Sinner** - I really didn't care for this album. All of the tracks are *good*, don't get me wrong. But it's just so... average. So regular. I mean, I can seriously fuck with songs like Trouble or Power Trip or Forbidden Fruit. But as someone who is supposed to be the 21st Century's answer to Nas, J. Cole just raps adequately. He didn't do anything revolutionary with this album. Which bothers me because I feel like he has the potential to be great.

**Young Rich Niggas** - Pretty awful project haha, but fun to listen to. Love the Versace Remix and Jumpin' Out Da Gym though. And to a lesser extent Hannah Montana.

**Acid Rap** - I have fucked with this project since day one. At least one song has been played ***every single day*** since this album/mixtape/whatever came out. I love it, it's most definitely gonna be in my top 5 for 2013.

**1999** - Y'know, initially I hated Joey Badtu$hie. But nowadays, he's really starting to grow on me. *shrug*

**Run the Jewels** - I couldn't listen to this while I was away, so I have only just listened to it today. Still needs to marinate some more I think.","1372638058"

He thought it was a temporary thing that I had done to myself, which isn't true. I've been struggling with it since I was 12, and I'm almost 22 now.
He was pretty arrogant and didn't ask me anything about my experiences with trying to manage it.

 His family didn't know if he was invincible, they only knew he was super strong. Nothing in his childhood suggests he was invincible. I'm sure they realized he was quite resilient, but invincible, I'm sure they didn't.

 The military knows who he is sure, but he's not staying at his mother's house. They're searching for the fortress of solitude, where he is living NOW.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I don't know what the whole situation is, but from what I gather, someone is attempting to use ""healing crystals"" as a substitute for proper medical care, no?

As a former practicing Wiccan, I can tell you that the use of Magick is, at best, a supplement to real-life action.  That is, if you are sick or injured, go see a doctor and use your ""healing crystals"" as an aide.  Any witch who has studied beyond his/her first year will know that **action** is a necessary component of *any* magickal undertaking, be it simply applying a charged amethyst to a pained area, or a complete spell.

If you are concerned for your friend, my suggestion is that you don't focus so much on dissuading her from using crystals, but give her a gentle reminder that they are only a part of the whole healing process -- a process which, by necessity, must involve a doctor.

Canonical would have to start tossing some cash to the retailers to get their OS on the shelves -- not to mention the difficulty in getting OEM's to actually sell an Ubuntu laptop. Please don't list the various boutique vendors (ie System76) that sell Ubuntu based systems online, because until HP, Dell (more than just Sputnik), and all (or at least most) the other commodity PC vendors get on board.

You can still make an argument that the US has moved from a military industrial complex to a prison industrial complex but it isn't as bad or as clear cut as reddit argues it is.

We do probably have too many people in prison for a lot of bad reasons. Many involving what would be considered minor drug offenses in other parts of the world.

Those are arguments you can make but reddit blows them way out of proportion and connects them to non-directly related variables like how many bullets cops in the US vs Germany fire in a year.

They are talking about actual issues that plague the country but they are doing it in an over the top and poorl throughout manner that allows them to pat each other on the back and say ""Good job for thinking this way without any real statistical, logical or factual backing.""","1372638067"

"circlebroke","t5_2tnz9","Yeah, I really skimmed right over that point because I felt like a lot of people would sort of take it for granted, and the bitch was already pretty goddamn long as it was.

I would definitely acknowledge that considering yourself a misunderstood genius in no way sets a direct path to ""Hitler wasn't so bad, but Mother Teresa was the devil.""  You can rub one out to your own brain without ever skirting near that thought, nor any other of reddit's favorite obsessions.  The Amerikkka jerk descends pretty directly from your standard second-option bias jerk, but what I'm referring to here as ""Alpha Jerks"" don't proceed from ""misunderstood genius"" quite as organically.

The reason it takes pride of place, though, is not so much because it _determines_ every other jerk but more because it _sustains_ them.  A normal person is going to smack themselves in the face when they start arguing that Hitler wasn't so bad, but not a misunderstood genius.  A normal person would eventually catch onto how one-dimensional it is to fetishize Sweden as some kind of white person utopia, not a misunderstood genius.  You can jerk all over Kim Dotcom without ever encountering issues of selective empathy, so these two jerks are ultimately distinct.  Misunderstood Genius, however, touches _everything_.

To take perhaps an easy example, a fundamentalist Christian might justify everything he does by a rock-solid belief in his own upright morality.  Every conclusion he reaches is correct by virtue of his enlightened moral sense.  Even when he does something most people would consider abhorrent (to go after long-hanging fruit, let's say beating up a gay), he can still rationalize it by reference to his infallible belief in his own moral superiority.  This fundamentalist might have other more distinct forms of bias, but it's the sense or moral righteousness which hands over and ultimately justifies every weird thing he does.  That's what a infallible conviction in their own edgy, misunderstood genius does to the average redditor.

Having said all that, I don't mean to exclude the influence of other factors, just highlighting what I think are the prime movers in all of this.  There's definitely Greater Internet Fuckwadery going on - somewhere there's another novel waiting to be written on how spending time online and growing accustomed to letting one's Greater Fuckwad run rampant eventually seeps into and poisons one's regular life.","1372638068"

For people who want to try kneeling down before someone, but don't have a partner or a reason to do so.  If that's you then this application allows you to try it out.  It's called Dogelus.

How to play:

First start the program.  Then attach the oculus to your head and kneel down.  Move your head close to the floor.  This is the basic pose for this demo.  

Now, while kneeling, beg for forgiveness.  (You can even go so far as to cry).

Have you apologized enough? Take a look at Miku's face.  If you've apologized enough then she will forgive you.  If not, you better get down and apologize some more.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Hey, congrats! You're doing really good! 2 words of advice though;

When you're (mostly) obese, you can use weight as a measurement tool of fat loss, but I think as you're starting to get leaner, that you should probably start measuring body fat as well (if you can, assuming you don't already).

Also, if you're bicycling, that's really the best way to loose fat, mainly because;

a) You can go long distance (burning more calories) without being bored (it's the reason I never used stationary bikes or a treadmill/running as a fat loss tool), and you can see lots of beautiful places, on and off road (Although I'm a road cyclist and prefer that).

b) It's a lot more efficient, meaning you go farther and can see more places then jogging would allow; plus it's low impact.

c) The last ride I did was 50 miles, and that burned just about 2000 calories. When you bicycle, your heart rate generally doesn't go too far up, although maintaining your heart rate at 70% will burn the most total amount of fat, and not keep you going too slow. 70% is also something that isn't very hard to maintain over long distances, unless you're climbing any mountains in which case is always hard, especially for me when I started.  5 months later, I can climb fairly decent heights (last 50 mi ride had a total 3800 ft gain, but only one actual climb over a 1900 ft mountain).

I'm probably being biased as a cyclist, but even if you're only going 10 miles now, all cyclists like me started there, and you really wouldn't believe how it's really not that hard to build up more endurance. I'd really recommend it.

Also, if you like cycling already (or not), you should definitely check out /r/bicycling. If you have any questions about bikes you can ask me or anyone there.","1372638076"

A stuffed pork loin can be done for no more than $3/person. 

One secret I use here in NYC is go to a supermarket that has an extensive cheese section that cuts it to order. When they have cut a piece so small they can't cut anymore they bundle it up with others and sell it as ""Cheese ends"" for $3/lb. They do it with ""smoked salmon ends"" and ""smoked fish ends"" too.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;Well into the 20th century, law and culture relegated women to second-class citizenship, restricting their ability to own property, make a living, and control their own bodies.

Obviously, I think such laws today don't make functional sense, but I can see how they made functional sense in ages past where women, by-and-large, couldn't support themselves, as there were more women than non-household jobs that didn't require strength of some sort.  This means most women's productive societal role was in caretaking and cleaning, making her ability to acquire money largely dependent on the husband.

Therefore, would there be a strong incentive to develop a legal framework for women to own property themselves, if most wouldn't be able to sustain it?  There was a reason widows were often taken care of by the wealthier men of a community.

Now, this doesn't mean such anti-women-owning property laws *need* to be written, because the market would produce such an outcome of women not owning much property by themselves anyways, but I can understand how such a widespread societal structure was codified in such laws.

So, as we've seen historically, technology has liberated women; it wasn't really the political movements.  Such political change only comes after technological and economic change.

To this end, I like to say dishwashers and laundry machines have liberated women to a greater extent than any Susan B. Anthony.

Industrialization in general and computerization in particular have allowed a greater number of women to independently support themselves.","1372638076"

I expected that they would be difficult to photograph, and they did not disappoint.  Very small fast subjects against an uncertain background.

There are two possible vantage points for them, once from on the bridge and the other from the ground directly east of it.

I was on the bridge and it wasn't something I could sanely photograph.  They were poorly lit dark specs rushing over a shaded evening ground/water. Essentially vanish entirely.

I'm assuming that they would be slightly easier to capture from below, where you could silhouette then against the still-bright sky.  Even then, though, it wouldn't be much of a photograph.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","regarding the alleged morality of slavery at the time of  jesus, are you familiar with the gladiators?  are you aware that the games may have begun as part of funerary rites in which the dead man had slaves fight for entertainment at his funeral?  that most [gladiators were slaves?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator)  against this backdrop, as well as the fact that the old testament has a wealth of information about how to get your slaves and how much you can beat them, the new testament says nothing condemning slavery.  in fact, it tells slaves to [obey their masters.](http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.html)  further, [some popes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_slavery) have owned slaves, and generally the church viewed it as allowed.  when did slavery go from acceptable to objectively immoral?

as far as the abolitionist movement and the civil rights movement, its debatable the role christianity held in moving things forward, but even assuming that it did, why did it take nearly 2000 years for christianity to have a problem with slavery?  for most of the history of christianity, it had no problem with slavery.  if the church has access to objective morality, and slavery is objectively immoral, why let it persist for generation upon generation?  why didn't jesus call for slave owners to free their slaves?  why did paul tell slaves to obey their masters, who were inflicting injustice upon them?

"gradadmissions","t5_2tn62","&gt;I am going to a fairly large school that supposedly has a plethora of opportunities, but I'm somewhat on the quiet side-how do you go about asking a professor to participate in their research?

I was in the same boat as you. As an incoming freshman to a large university (freshman class size of around 5,000), there were a *ton* of opportunities. My school had something called the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, which was exactly what I wanted to do. They provided pay of 11.50/hr, meaning a total of about 100 hours, or about 7 hours a week. Google ""&lt;university name&gt; undergraduate research"" for a similar program at your school.

I emailed a ton of profs (over 30) and mentioned the UROP program and was interested in their research. 6 profs got back to me, and one said yes. I waited a semester (I had to) before I started any research, but I would recommend doing research the second semester. It has defined my college experience, and I've learned a **ton** from it.

For example: I'm an electrical engineering major. I first started out doing research in the Civil Engineering dept., because they were the only ones that said yes. It turned into a summer job, which was enjoyable. The beginning of my sophomore year, I did another UROP in my field, but wasn't interested in it. Then, I did yet another UROP, and fell in love with topic: I'm getting my PhD in it (and it's in the signal processing subfield). Going on my junior year, it's unusual that I've decided so early, but I really love the topic.

&gt;One more thing (sorry). How important for graduate admissions is the school I attended as an undergraduate?

Not at all, as long as your school is part of the upper tier. If you're going to any University of *, don't worry (and others are in that tier!). What matters more is how much you are involved. I would much rather take someone who did research, was engaged, and got good grades from the University of Washington than some slacker from MIT. I'm at a University of *, and my honors advisor has seen graduates go to MIT, Stanford, Caltech...

&gt;What should I concentrate on during the next four years? Clubs, programming contests, research, personal coding projects, GPA...all of it? What do they want to see?

They want to see all of it, of course. But do what you do.","1372638085"

"fatpeoplestories","t5_2vzax","Low carb diets work because people increase their relative intake of protein. Low carb diets aren't magic. 

Calorie counting and realistic calculation of TDEE (not oh I exercised for 2 minutes so I burned 6000 calories!) is all you need to lose weight.

To improve body composition during weight loss (which improves on it's own during weight loss too, unless you're starving yourself) you need to do resistance exercise and have a relatively high intake of protein without going on too heavy of a caloric deficit.

To improve cardiovascular health (which improves on it's own during weight loss too!) you need regular cardiovascular exercise.

http://examine.com/faq/what-should-i-eat-for-weight-loss.html

http://examine.com/faq/how-does-protein-affect-weight-loss.html

**TL;DR**: Keto isn't magic. Neither is paleo. Hit 1.4-2.2g/kg of protein everyday, and 0.3-0.6g/kg of fiber, exercise regularly, sleep enough, don't overeat (the most important), and you should be good.","1372638085"

"FIFA","t5_2qxh7","I've been playing Fifa for about 10 years, starting on PS2 and since the PS3 came out, on that. Prior to this year, I'd mostly played against the CPU - primarily career mode. My few previous forays into online play had convinced me that online players were too good so I just played career mode on semi-pro or pro. 

This year I decided to give FUT a go and I quickly became addicted. It forced me to become a better player. Actually starting off in FUT offline mode forced me to play against the CPU at higher difficulty settings and I gradually improved enough to start winning a lot of those matches.

Aside from just playing a lot, the thing that really helped me get better is watching a lot of youtube videos. There are many out there, so watch a few until you find a youtuber who you like and start with his more introductory videos. Watch them a few times and try to implement some of the techniques. You will definitely get better.

Now I'd say I'm a pretty good Fifa player and I'm constantly trying to get better. On FUT I'm usually in either division 2 or 1, although honestly more often in division 2. I've never won division 1 yet but I'm trying. I would say I'm a very good defender but a not very good goal scorer. I think I need to get better with a few skill moves so my finishing can improve and that is the next thing I'm working on. Again, youtube videos are my go-to source for learning new techniques.","1372638091"

"creepy","t5_2raed","To the 4chan OP's credit, the bots weren't really shown to have learned anything really ""valuable."" They just behaved in a manner that was unusual for them which may or may not have been the result of the simulation lasting for so long.  I don't know about all the limitations you mentioned.  Maybe the guy was running a tweaked version or an outdated version that allowed the bots to continue collecting data indefinitely (think about it, we don't know how long it took the bots to stop fighting, they may have been like that for years.  If you we're the developer of their AI and this was a flaw that was shown to happen after the bots are left for a period of time, a later patch might have been implemented to prevent them from ever reaching such passive lines of code.). What makes the post interesting though is that equally matched bots, mathematically calculating the most efficient way to maintain a non-negative k/d score, might plausibly come to the realization that the only consistent way to do this would be to stay at 0/0.  Other than that, there wouldn't be anything significant to learn from their behavior other than from a philosophical standpoint (I mean its not like they figured out how to communicate or something) but that's still interesting/creepy by itself.

&gt;Do I tell him that I know?  Do I let him know how it's affecting me? 

Yes and yes. Why wait around until it becomes even worse before you step in? Every moment you sit not making your feelings know to him the worse off you are. There isn't any point in letting him temporarily coast along being secretive because we all know its just going to end badly. 

&gt;How is it that this man who is the most honest person I know, is now lying by omission about his drinking and thinking that's okay?

People can have relatively normal, honest and healthy lives in just about every aspect besides their drinking. It's not terribly common, but it does happen. The big concern is that over time his behavior about his drinking is going to start appearing in his behavior about everything else in his life. 

Honestly, I don't think you're ever going to feel particularly ready to go to an ALANON meeting. It's probably gonna have to be something you force yourself to do, at least at first. By putting off going you are allowing yourself to be more vulnerable. 

Whatever you do, don't condone his drinking. That means don't drink around him or with him. Don't let him drink around you, whether he is hiding it or not. If he drinks, leave the house. Don't support or ignore any of his bad behavior stemming from his drinking.

Having a TEFL will give you an edge if you are directly competing for a job with someone who doesn't have one and, if you try for a job at one of the Universities it makes it more likely that they'll give you a serious consideration but apart from that you're fine without it.

Should you have the time and opportunity I'd still recommend getting a TEFL as it will give you a leg up and more options. Should you decide to continue to pursue ESL teaching in countries other than Korea it will be something you'll be glad to have as many of them require it","1372638098"

Feinstein boycotted every debate.  She has refused to debate anyone for over 12 years - instead choosing to outspend ALL her opponents combined by 30 to 1.  See Levitt2012.org.

Senator Feinstein has been at the center of efforts to keep illegal government activities secret so they can continue.  This includes warrantless surveillance, torture (which she calls advanced interrogation), kidnapping (which she calls rendition) and more.  These are all illegal.  This summer there will be a focus on enforcing the UN Convention Against Torture and getting the Senator (and others, like Senator Graham) to testify under oath and/or resign.

"canada","t5_2qh68","I've helped about a dozen friends from Europe and other countries around the world immigrate to Canada (I travel a lot).

I always tell them: if you can speak even rudimentary French, apply through the Quebec Selection process (Saskatchewan also has its own provincial selection process, and other provinces are getting theirs too). All that really means is that they say they *intend* to live in Quebec on the application. Why should they do this? Because [Quebec selects it's immigrants](http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/), and once you've been given a *Certificat de sélection du Québec* - which in my experience is a lot quicker (almost always &lt; 1 year) than going through the normal way, their immigration file is kicked up to the feds to vet for medical and security reasons. Unfortunately, federal CIC often taken over a year to do these two simple things, but overall going through Quebec is faster. But most importantly you are much more likely to be accepted through it if you can communicate in basic French. 

Quebec is acutely aware of their declining population relative to the rest of Canada and NA, and are pro-active in accepting French-speaking immigrants. They need to be. They will even enroll you in a year or two of French training, full or part-time, if your French is weak (not only is it free for you, but they will pay you a monthly stipend to live on while you study). It's a good deal.

What if you don't want to actually live in Quebec? Then don't - you can land anywhere you want at an airport or border crossing and go live wherever, without ever setting foot in Quebec. No government can make you live anywhere in Canada - it's against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

As an anglophone Westerner I'd encourage you to at least check Quebec out though, especially if you have a family. Jobs are harder to find but it's a great province and the people are nice, and can't beat the support system for families (daycare, medical care, etc etc).

- Political crisis in Europe

- Political crisis in China (I don't think there will be a financial crisis)


Long term unstoppable trends (next 10 years):

- Rise of China over US and (especially) Japan

- Decline in Europe due fiscal position / lack of flexibility and size of government as % of GDP

- Increasing price of oil

- Resilience of US economy due to USD reserve currency status, flexibility of workforce and scale of financial markets.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Yes, yes(what other reason could you think of to make it so?) and both :)

We know that physically punishing children, the old ""spare the rod..."", is [wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment_in_the_home#Research_on_parental_corporal_punishment). I don't see how you can justify violence against someone comparatively helpless when it is shown to have no or detrimental effects - especially since you cannot predict which of the two it will be.  
Steven Pinker [tells us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgGEKBSOeEY) that the chance of being caught in the first place is a far more effective deterrent than the death penalty. You can't really apologize to someone you executed innocently, but you can release them and admit judicial error if you didn't. This upholds the principle ""in dubio pro reo"" consequently, which the death penalty does not.  

The effects of the enlightenment did not spread through the populace first and then forced the governments by democratic means to abolish these forms of punishment - it was the other way around. In fact, many violent crimes (I don't have the figures, but I believe it might even be the majority) are still committed because the perpetrator feels a right for personal retributive justice. One of the reasons the death penalty is still prevalent in the US is the widespread belief in democracy coupled with the widespread belief in retributive justice.","1372638114"

&gt; When faced with a counterexample to a universal claim, rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original universal claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule.

I believe if you go back and read my comments, you'll eventually realize that what happened is quite simple. 

You made a ""universal claim"", ie ""communism = Marxism"" after which,

I rejected your universal claim, ie ""... that doesn't make the two equal.""

Less than half a century ago you had no real reason to think that potentially large amounts of your personal information was being documented and stored, it would have taken a targeted effort on you personally to get the kind of information that can now be plucked from the air on millions of people via the internet.

It seems to me that the reason people are shocked is less about the spying, and more about how it seems to be an intrusion by foreign governments into the personal information of a vast amount of civilians.","1372638125"

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","I'm having hard time writing this, because my post keeps on devolving off topic, and I need to keep this short, because I understand that ME is a topic for which many people are passionate, and there is no point kicking that particular hornet's nest.

I understand where you're coming from. Being able to transfer your character between each game is a neat feature. The Witcher also has this. Having said that, as you start with saying that you're offering a counterpoint, I think I need counter your counterpoint by saying that this feature doesn't make the game more or less of an RPG (the tension of this classification being the thrust of my above post).

The second thing I'm getting from your post, and I think a lot of people's posts really, is about choice. This is tricky for me to articulate so forgive me if this sounds overly aggressive: I think a lot of the choice in ME is a paper tiger, and I don't think it's as interesting as people make out. Or at the very least, not as interesting to me.

Again, I want to keep it short, so if you've got 10 minutes (or, if you're really pushed for time just watch the first 5 minutes), I think you should check this video out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJJaGSV75y0 (minor Fallout1 spoilers and ME2 spoilers inside). It's fairly close to my opinion on the matter with the added bonus of being more articulate than I could ever be.

Last thing: just to repeat: none of this makes the games bad (or good). It just means that, from my perspective, they were not what I thought they were going to be, which has led me to dislike them. Maybe one day I can reset my expectations and enjoy them for what they are.","1372638126"

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","I'm going to question the validity of the statement ""round object roughly (a) foot in diameter"" simply because, other than the wheel assemblies (which would be pretty obvious if they fell off while driving), there really isn't anything round that large in the area which you describe, and certainly nothing that would rattle whenever you hit a bump.

My first guess would be a sway bar link. If you had a damaged one it could bang onto things when you go over a bump, and if it fell off while traveling at speed its end-over-end action could have looked like something round about a foot in diameter. If it was already damaged (as I would guess it was) then you wouldn't have noticed any difference while driving.

My second guess would be an evaporation canister. Normally it's secured to the body or fender well, but if it wasn't that would account for the rattle. It's usually a rounded container, and they can be on the large side.

It's impossible for anyone to determine whether or not your car is safe to drive. **IF** it's the evap canister then yes, it's safe to drive. If it's the sway bar link, I would consider it unsafe to drive — but if it's the sway bar link you've already been driving an unsafe car anyway. But we have literally no way of knowing what it was. Therefore my advice to you is to take it into a shop, maybe even the dealership, for a thorough once-over.","1372638129"

Doing the maths there it does seem unfair to think all members of the military were Nazis.

One thing to remember is that the NSDAP didn't refer to themselves as Nazis.  Nazi was used by the opponents of the NSDAP to make fun of them.

I remember wondering what the point of persevering was, and maybe I was too cowardly to approach anyone to talk about the problems I had. I couldn't do work, I got lazy and watched TV a lot, and as far as I could tell no one gave a shit who I was.

I'm now 24 and look back and wonder how far I've come. Even in only 1 year, let alone 9. There is so much that the world has to offer you, and so much that you have to offer the world that you won't even have any idea about.

I've fallen for a lot of girls in my life, and when each relationship, or even friendship didn't pan out the way I thought it would, I thought that was it, I would never find anyone again. But there are a lot of people out there, and a lot of people willing to give you a chance. Maybe you haven't met them yet, but they're out there.

And actually, what you think people think of you might not be as deep as you think. Being 15 is the perfect age to make mistakes. Much better then than when you're 25, and that includes all aspects of life. Maybe talk to a few of your ""lost"" friends, they might surprise you. And if they can't help you, I'm sure there'll be some adults who can offer a better perspective.

Take it easy.","1372638135"

"mtgjudge","t5_2uv8o","edit: tl;dr: You name the card when Slaughter Games resolves because the card doesn't tell you to name it when you cast the card.

Unburial Rites 

Innistrad, Uncommon

Sorcery, 4B (5)

Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.

Flashback {3}{W} (You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)

----------


Slaughter Games 

 Return to Ravnica, Rare

Sorcery, 2BR (4)

Slaughter Games can't be countered by spells or abilities.

Name a nonland card. Search target opponent's graveyard, hand, and library for any number of cards with that name and exile them. Then that player shuffles his or her library.


--------------

Inspiration 

 Return to Ravnica, Common

Instant, 3U (4)

Target player draws two cards.

--------------


Let's check in with the Comprehensive Rules (Section 601.2) to get a refresher on how to cast a spell. Do these, in order:

1. Announce that you're going to cast a specific spell. Move it from wherever it is (graveyard, hand) to the Stack.
2. Decide and announce any additional costs (splice, fuse, kick, convoke, etc). Decide if you're going to pay phyrexian mana, if applicable. This step doesn't matter for the examples so we can move past it for now.
3. Announce a target(s) for the spell, as required. For Unburial Rites this means that *you're targeting a target creature card in your graveyard*. For Slaughter Games it means *you're targeting a target opponent*.
4. Figure out if you're dividing counter or effects (Think of Flames of the Firebrand) between the counters and how you're doing that.
5. Figure out the total cost of the spell including any taxing or reducing effects. For Unburial Rites from the hand is 4B; Slaughter Games, 2BR.
6. Make mana to pay for the spell
7. You can pay for the costs in any order. Altar's Reap requires a sacrifice when you cast. You can sacrifice a guy first and then tap lands, or you can tap lands and then put a guy into the bin. It's up to you.
8. Once everything is done here in order correctly the spell is cast! Sweet.

Now that we remember how to cast spells we can look more closely at item 3 (601.2c) and learn what it means.

Nothing on Slaughter Games asks us to name a card *as an additional cost to cast the spell* so we don't have to. Unburial Rites forces us to target the creature card as part of casting so we're required to do that.

Once Slaughter Games is paid for and resolves we name the card because it's part of its effect. Just like if we want to cast Inspiration we don't draw the two cards before the opponent gets to respond; we have to wait because all it tells us to do is to target a player when we cast the spell. Drawing cards is part of the spell's effect. This applies just the same to Slaughter Games and similar cards.","1372638139"

Yes some of this breeding and selecting took place outdoors in NorCal, but until recently growing outdoors in the open has been totally no-go.  Do you understand what I'm saying?

Absolutely. Maybe not in the same way that a twenty-minute mobility session is (which I do, later at night), but I can get into a much better position if I spend a few minutes warming up, stretching, and smashing my hips, calves, and shoulders. I can squat lower, maintain a more vertical torso, and get under the bar faster. There's no long-term improvements from that little work (it goes away, basically, once I've cooled down), but spending 2 minutes working on a joint can yield noticeable differences. It's like warming up your ROM.","1372638151"

*The Sword, I am mortal against any weapon; no spear, no pollaxe, no dagger, is effective against me; long or short I can do. And I will come to the Close Play; and come to sword disarms and to wrestling; with my art I can do breaks and binds, I know well how to make covers and injuries; always in these I want to finish. I will make those who fight against me weep. And I am Royal and I maintain the justice; I increase goodness and I destroy malice. Those who will look at me making my crosses, of facts of armed combat I will make famous and vose.*

Even Walmart has some decent produce, at least in my area. It couldn't be easier! Eat only raw veggies, fruits, sprouted seeds and nuts, plus healthy oils and honey; drink only water, fresh juices and smoothies. Now, that is just me. For my husband, we have him doing Paleo, which might appeal more to you. For his breakfast, I usually take one day and make several pans full of egg muffins, and he eats two of those and whatever he wants to drink.

I saw a girl purposely knock all of a boys things off his desk and when he told the girl to piss off, he got detention. A couple of girls in my class ""didn't do as well as they could have"" on a government set numeracy and literacy test, so she let them re-sit the test. Re-sit a fucking government set test that they all now knew the questions involved, and big surprise they got better marks. I could go on forever about her.

Just to answer your one question, I do believe there should be exclusive clubs allowed, yes. It is impossible to clarify the need for every subset of society to want to co-mingle with their like minded peers in a relaxed atmosphere in this day and age without diving into political incorrectness, but it does exists. This tends to happen on it's own regardless of lows. Country bars draw in mostly white, blue collar men and women. Blacks are of course allowed in, but the tension instantly ups to uncomfortable levels. Same thing if a white college boy struts into a known black bar and tries to get chummy. The same goes for Men's Clubs. Was it really so wrong for men to want to hang out with other men, smoke a cigar and bitch about their wives, kids, jobs, football team, whatever?

There is a popular meme floating around reddit that has the punchline, ""You're not wrong. You're just an asshole."" That is what the forced integration of private social clubs is. We are not talking schools here. Not places of employment or public and government buildings here. I am referring to private social clubs that allowed like minded individuals the chance to relax and decompress in a comfortable environment. Instead now they are forcibly required to admit those who mostly only want to be in because they were told they couldn't be, and not for much of any other reason.

&gt;No one. But the key difference is that they have the chance to get it. If they want something enough they can work harder and buy it. This isn't an option in your system. Capitalism offers opportunity. Socialism and communism impose limits.

In a communist society, everyone has an opportunity. In capitalist countries, not everyone has the same opportunity. If education were completely free, I would be more accepting of a market system.


&gt;Here you're comparing real-world capitalism to theoretical communism. It's important to remember that in all attempts to pull off your utopia so far not only did people not have what they needed, they spent most of their time starving.

That's because those attempts implemented communism incorrectly. Also, they were Marxist systems, and I'm not a Marxist.


&gt;I don't think this would just be a small percentage. And if there is no government, what's to stop them from changing the system?

Most people would enjoy the communist system. And the system wouldn't chance, because no one would accept the change.


&gt;No, they're the same thing. But at least now you're admitting that a government is there to crack the whip on us slaves. Now tell me, who elects this government? If the people want to eliminate communism and go back to normal would there be an option in the polls?

A state is different from a government. In a stateless society, if a consensus has to be reached, decisions would be made via direct democracy. 


&gt;What if I don't want them to?

You wouldn't have a choice. If you have 9 bedrooms you aren't using, and 9 people need a place to live, you have to let them stay there. That's the problem with capitalism: one person can have a house with 20 bedrooms, and there can be 20 homeless people down the street, and capitalists don't see that as a problem.


&gt;Why wouldn't I be able to prevent them from doing so? 

How would you prevent them from doing so? You wouldn't have a police department to call regarding that issue.


&gt;If there's no state what is compelling me to act like a good communist?

If you are constantly breaking rules, the rest of the community would just ignore you and let you fend for yourself.


&gt;What if I don't want to?

That would be your only option. It's more important to protect the environment.


&gt;A yacht, a supercomputer, a Bugatti Veyron, and a high-rise apartment.

You could probably have a boat and a supercomputer. You could have any car you want (in fact, the factories would start to make more luxury cars, so everyone could have one). The car would be made to have better gas mileage, though, if it doesn't have that already. And you could definitely have a high rise apartment. 

The nice thing is, you can have pretty much everything you want, and everyone else can too. That's what is nice about communism.


&gt;In capitalism every transfer of wealth or work is agreed to by both parties. In a capitalist system it is impossible for a non-government entity to oppress anyone because all such arrangements are voluntary.

Not really. People can't really opt out of the capitalist system.


&gt;That is the case for very few people. And socialist states that have existed thus far a much, much smaller percentage of the population has its basic need met.

That's because socialist states are not communist societies.


&gt;Of course there's equality. All citizens are equal before the eyes of the law. 

There isn't economic equality.

&gt;How? By enforcing property rights? Listen, it is perfectly possible for you and like-minded people to form a commune within a capitalist system. You could live a communist lifestyle right now without forcing it on everyone else.

Not really, there wouldn't be factories or anything to make the stuff we need. Now, if there were a large region that was a communist society, I would consider that. Still, communism would work best if the whole world were involved.","1372638157"

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","Hey there, Kayle main here. I usually play Kayle jungle when I don't get kayle mid, so here are some of my thoughts.  
  
Kayle isn't a very good tank. If you are going to play her, you should build her as a secondary source of damage. You're ult is much better used on your teammates than it is on yourself.  
  
Kayle has very strong ganks, but isn't the strongest of duelists early on. If a strong duelist with high damage such as a lee sin invades your jungle, you may be in trouble. That said, Kayle isn't all that mana hungry if you don't focus on leveling her Q first.  
  
In the jungle I play her with 21-0-9 masteries, attack speed marks, armor seals, ap or mr blues, and ms quints. This helps me deal more damage and get around the map faster. I usually go R-E-Q-W for skills.  
  
For the build, it varies. Kayle has a very versatile build, but usually I like to prioritize attack speed and cooldown reduction. Personally, I usually get the spirit of the elder lizard for the true dmg, a stinger that will eventually build into either a nashors or a zephyr, and then choose to go ad or ap by building a botrk or something like a guinsoos rageblade.  
  
I don't find chalice all that useful on kayle. Not that is is a bad item, but more like there are better choices. The 20% cdr when you level up is fine, but if you get other cdr items like nashors, there isn't much need for it. The mana issues don't really bother me after a few levels.   
  
Anyways, those are my 2 cents.","1372638162"

Except for the fact that there are still people who are desperate enough to try, and always will be. In areas like the QZ where there is no immediate threat, people won't bite, unless they're shown solid proof. Outside, where people are barely surviving, they might. That is, if there are places with enough organization left (as, obviously, bandits will shoot on sight).

http://imgur.com/4HcUK7M

And its always drawn just like the star of david, because the reason its associated with the occult is because of a book published in the middle ages called:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon

Purported to have been used by solomon for demonology. 

As well as:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_Goetia_of_Solomon_the_King

and the greater keys of solomon, used for angelology.

Creating fake magickal and religious artifacts was faddish at the time and this made somebody a fortune.

The masons use it differently its just a representation of as above so below, as it pertains to god's connection with us and our connection with the divine.

Your problem is you think you can generalize a symbol as being a part of the occult without realizing that there is no continuity of symbolism in the occult at all, and that it is something that is a part of every culture, and every region of the world, and that the symbols they use can have millions of meanings depending upon who you talk to because its probably the most diverse aspect of humanity there is since its so personal and secret.

Most of the satanic, secret cabal, and nwo references were made up by scam artists and widely spread by schizophrenics, tweakers, and other conspiracy theorists.

Quite a few organisms use something called an electron transport chain to make [useful] energy-- essentially you use light or chemical energy to rip electrons off molecules, and use these electrons to create a chemical gradient (like pumping water uphill). This chemical gradient is used to power a [turbine of sorts.](http://imgur.com/gallery/Uc4UyfT)

So for this electron transport chain to work, you need two things: a molecule that will donate the electron (low affinity for electrons), and one that will accept it (high affinity for electrons). 

 For animals, we use food (sugars/fats) as our donors-- it's very easy to strip electrons off of them because they're very electron rich. We use O2 as our acceptors; O2 has a very strong affinity for electrons. Before O2, though, organisms would use other chemicals as acceptors; chemicals that had lower affinity for electrons. This wasn't as efficient, but oxygen was toxic to them, so they had no choice. This is why being able to tolerate oxygen AND use it was so beneficial (and why the majority of organisms today use oxygen as their electron acceptor).

I may have oversimplified some things, but hopefully that gives you an idea.","1372638177"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you're truly miserable and truly struggling with college, academically or financially or emotionally or any combination of those, in your freshman year or even later: **DO** realize that college isn't for everyone.  

Yes, it's a huge part of the culture of the American Dream; yes, it's this amazing opportunity for higher education; yes, it can be a valuable experience in terms of pretty much everything, from classes to living on your own to social life.  

But if you're unhappy, not finishing college is *not* the end of the world.  If you're losing sleep over failing all your classes, if you don't know why you're there year after year, if you stress out over the student loans required to keep you there, it's okay to withdraw.  It's okay to go to community college - either for a few years before transferring back to a four-year, or to get your actual degree.  Hell, trade schools are awesome, and in some ways set you up for life and a high-paying job much, much better than a traditional four-year college.  Everyone going to a traditional four-year college and thriving there is largely a myth grown up these past fifty or so years.  Graduating with a degree from a prestigious university isn't a passport to happiness, wealth, and a fulfilling job, no matter what you decide to major in.  (Especially in today's economy!)

Just remember, there are other options.  Do what makes you happy.

Mind you, as a freshman, there's going to be some hard moments: don't just quit because it's difficult.  But if your situation is bad, and you truly feel like it isn't right for you, talk with a counselor, your mom, your brother, whatever.  College isn't necessarily the only portal to adult life.

But if you do stay in school,

**DO** travel if you can manage it, especially study abroad.  You'll end up more immersed in foreign culture from a school's travel program than you ever will after college in tours/vacations/holidays, and once you're in the real world, you'll have to quit your job in order to spend that much time in a foreign country.

* make the pasta normally correctly boil the pasta, make your sauce and combine them together. 

* then, in a small pan heat some olive oil up. you can use any other type of oil but I think olive oil tastes the best. 

* take your pasta and place it in the pan. it needs to be a thin layer; almost like you are cooking hash browns and LEAVE IT ALONE 

* cook it to your preferred crispiness. you'll be able to tell when it's starting to become ""fried"" because it takes on a totally different scent (that is so heavenly!!!)

I dunno', I think it was a pretty nice place to live.  The gym is small, but nice.  Same with the pool.  I never really used the ""club room"" or whatever they called it until we were waiting for the Red Cross to help us with food and clothes and stuff.

""predators are noble and pretty""  attitude , and zero regard for the consequences of letting them run amok.  youre condemning the actions of trained educated wildlife specialists, because what they do doesnt jive with your emotional reaction.  im pretty sure that people whose education and career is based around wildlife management know better than you do.  just shut the fuck up already and go find some cause that you actually understand","1372638186"

But I know another couple I was good friends with, the girl was perfect and loved him and put up with all his shit and he was just this tortured, indecisive musician that put her through the same thing. If there was any 'one' for him, it was her. She's finally moving on with her life after going through the cycle more times than I did, and she's making the best of it, but anyone who knew them could look at them and see...she was the one for him but he wouldn't let anyone get close enough and when he did, he'd push them away and change his mind and whatever the antics they pull are. It had nothing to do with her. If I hadn't seen this and known them so well, I might have been more inclined to believe your line of thinking.

&gt; Germany's top court also recently upheld the right of security agencies to maintain an anti-terror database containing sensitive personal information about German citizens.

&gt; ""I am concerned about this, but on the other hand, this common database is very, very small compared with the figure reported recently on the surveillance actions by U.S. authorities,"" he says.

&gt; Furthermore, there are extensive sharing agreements between the NSA and European countries. Did you even watch the news this week?

That SIGINT-derived ""agreement"" after WW2? Doesn't count. It's bad enough that such agreements still exist.

The issue at hand is mass surveillance by two ""allies"". One of which has put Germany on the same level as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and China.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","In terms of being able to actually jungle without the best rune set, I'd say you're good to go with nunu, udyr, warwick and fiddle, however the last 2 are either hard to play (fiddle) or have a rather weak impact (ww). Nunu however is a very strong pick at the moment, even for beginners, you can pick him and mess around a little bit by trying to counterjungle, learning how to gank/have map control. Same goes for udyr with the exception that he's easier to outplay, which means you need to play more carefully than with nunu. 
Other good/easy champs you could try (if you get help from your teammates at the beginning) are Jarvan IV (strong but difficult) and Xin Zhao (simple but still effective) (both more damage oriented) and tanky cc machines such as Nautilus and Sejuani.
 
 
Itemwise start machete + 5 pots and depending on your champ spiritstone (if your clearing depends on abilities) or madreds (if you clear mainly by auto attacking). As you most of the time lack gold you should build most of the time cost efficient tank items such as spirit of the ancient golem, locket of the iron solari or aegis.
Building those items also helps if you get behind by doing mistakes as you're still somehow useful with providing auras and cc.
 
 
The most important part about jungling is getting map awareness, having general game knowledge and instinct as nearly everything you do depends on the situation of the game.
As for map awareness: buy wards and always look at your minimap when you're going from one camp to another. 
 
 
Timers are another important part: 5 min for the buff camps, 6 min drake and 7 min baron. You should time drake and baron and know the rough timers of at least your own buffs.
 
 
Another tip is watch the enemy jungler. Always think: what would I do and try to counter that. Countering ganks unexpectedly often rewards you with a kill/assist.
 
 
A tipp to improve your ganking: wait till the last possible moment to use your cc/gap closing spell to maximize its effect. If you dont need to start your gank using those spells dont do it. If you have the possibility to just run up to the enemy, do it and then use your stuff.
 
 
To explain everything takes way to long and most of the stuff you need to learn is by experiencing it anyway so just go into normals and try new stuff. Ignore rager and try to improve your decisionmaking - always calculate the risk/reward you have doing something and ask yourself: ""Is it worth doing what im about to do or is there another more rewarding option""?","1372638201"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt; Wait, is this true? Can you expand on this?

I would suggest checking out Paulo Freire's book *Teachers as Cultural Workers* on this topic. He argues that treating teachers (and teachers seeing themselves as) as caregivers rather than professionals diminishes their political capital when it comes to receiving the respect deserved of their professionalism. Rather than focusing on teachers, in a broad cultural context, as professionals who are educating young minds through the deployment of skill and commitment, they are branded as being little more than glorified baby-sitters. 

The easy way to think about this as a political gesture, as one that makes education appear to be less useful than it actually is in a democracy is to think about the similar manner in which college students are labeled with identifying qualities of people who spend all their time getting drunk and having sex. This too reduces the political capital that college students have when they try to enter political discourse in public arena they are labeled as lazy and hedonistic, when the truth is that a large amount of college students study laboriously, work full and part time jobs, and are seriously invested in their education (even if it is just to the extent of getting a job). But, regardless of what actually occurs in the real existence of being a college student or teacher, the types of labels that we use to demean them as hard-working individuals, experts at what they do, and part and parcel of any real democratic development of society, they are brought down by calling them baby-sitters, claiming they only work 9 months a year, treating teaching as a fall-back profession in public discourse, and on and on. 

The way we label teachers has a real impact on how teachers are viewed as a part of society just as it impacts how they may see themselves when they work their asses off only to be described as baby-sitters rather than strict professionals.","1372638201"

I only recently read the books, but had watched the movies many MANY times over the years so I hope that my answer can still count.  

The movies flowed perfectly to me. Everything made sense to me, and nothing left me confused. Even the HBP - I was like  ""WHOOOAA"" when the reveal was made and thought it was pretty cool, yet I've seen comments on here from others who read that books first that that part of the movie wouldn't make any sense.  It made sense to me. I didn't need the whole back story to understand where the name ""prince"" came from. I thought that was a pretty big moment in the movie and again, readers felt that they mostly glossed over the whole thing.  

Reading the books gave me insight to things so that I could better understand them. But I was never lost in the movies.  There were small things here and there that were mentioned or made light of in the movie but I didn't pay attention to them, and they didn't make me confused, and it was only after reading that ""Oh hey, that was kind of an important thing"" 

It was difficult for the movie creators, but they did an excellent job in my opinion. They didn't ruin the books, and they kept pace very well.

For my bulk I was using 5/3/1.  I would prefer Texas Method, but work+family means I have a very irregular workout schedule and not much time, and 5/3/1 is a lot more flexible.

I have been past the point where SS would work for quite some time (even with all the weight gain my lifts are still in the high intermediate range, and should be back up to advanced within a couple months through a combination of increased lifts and decreased body weight).  I will use RPT for the cut to reduce volume (will be doing 2 full-body workouts per week, with press, bench, squat every day and deadlift once per week, 5 ""rest days"").  I will also be taking alpha-yohimbine+yohimbine (I can't take enough yohimbine HCL to be effective without feeling like I'm going to die, but found 10mg alpha-yohimbine+5mg yohimbine works) and doing fasted LISS cardio, with maybe 1 session of HIIT/week if I can manage it without overtraining.","1372638207"

But first of all this was about *half a* decade ago, secondly the company was probably the most successful production company at the time (their biggest flop still cleared twice the budget in from box office alone). Third they had just launched their internship program and they only paid the first 3 generations (semesters worth) of interns.

But honestly that wasn't even the most unbelievable part about it. Not only was it paid, but it was more than double the pay for most entry level jobs. I seriously remember calculating it out to $35 an hour one week, granted this was a week where I had unusually short hours at the same pay I would if I had worked the full week.

Edit: Forgot to type ""half a"".","1372638215"
"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Hmm.. For 3.5, although the overall book was kind of terrible, there are some rather fun undead and templates in Libris Mortis (shameful latin, that). I think it would depend a lot on what you wanted to use the undead for. It's an accessory in a way, so if you don't feel good with melee combat, you might want something meaty and physically impressive, like a zombied just-about-anything, or you need something intelligent to act more like a familiar, in which case there are various spirits and more intelligent undead. If you're just looking for something fun for the character, you could go with some spirit possessed clothing, like a Raimant. If you want to push people around in battle a bit, an undead swarm of some kind... perhaps a swarm of undead rats? Rats tend to be a fairly omnipresent land critter that end up in maritime regions, only to drown when ships go down, etc. And once undead, their zombies could be pretty amphibious.

If you wanted to do something like a swarm, you'd find a small relatively weak low-CR creature like a rat or a bird, etc, then apply an undead template like zombie, skeleton, etc, and then slam a swarm template on it. Unfortunately, it has been a long while since I played 3.5, so I'm not up on the best repositories of online info about templates but with digging I'm sure you could find something.

Another fun possibility from Libris Mortis would be the 'Ghost Brute' template thrown on a shark. That would make it a spectral flying shark. Repeat the following in your head for a moment... ""Flying. Ghost. Shark.""

It just... has this ring to it.

Then there are things like the 'Necromental', which is a negative energy afflicted elemental template. So you could take a water elemental and essentially pack it with negative energy. A large would probably be around 8 HD, which may be in your control limits. That's also from Libris Mortis. There are also various waterlogged mummies and such, some of which can be found in other books. The Stormwrack book has an entire section on water animals, including some of the weird aquatic aberrations, etc. But in it there are critters like the Hammerclaw, which is a giant 6HD lobster begging for a zombie template. Plus, your traditional monstrous crabs. Everyone loves monstrous crab skeletons. Put a chair inside it's hollowed out carcass and it's your personal mode of transportation. Oh, and the book has some water dinosaurs.

Good luck.","1372638215"

1. I feel like the blurred foliage in the foreground detracts from the overall image. To me it now feels like a small first-person viewpoint rather than an epic scale. Not sure what you were going for though.

2. The brightness on the right side and darkness on the left side opposes the feel of the piece. I assume the left is good and right is evil? By changing the left side to a lighter look and the right to a darker type I think you'll give the picture a better perception of the good vs evil.

The new song system doesn't bother me much either, but I suppose I'd have to look into it a bit more.  Seems more involved as opposed to the other system, where you just refreshed your songs every so often.  

If I don't see much of an improvement in thm's damage output within the near future, I may just pick up archer again.  I'd rather not main a class that is getting pigeonholed into a CC bot.

Really, I think you should be able to find enough points to add vigorous spirits to add spirit utilities to your group. Stone spirit would have added a lot of protection uptime which would have allowed you to keep higher uptime on the boss. Your group lacked 100% burning uptime so Sun Spirit would have added at least 600 DPS.

Skirmishing trait choices seem off. Attack of opportunity is a PVP trait.

Snow leapard could have helped your group stack some might.

Not sure why you're taking LB/SB cooldown reduction when you're using melee :P

Damage seemed low, but your group wasn't at 25 might/25 vuln, but to be honest I see bigger hits using my Longbow build, but I guess they hit   a lot slower.

Examples of the ""Faux Reality"" shows would be any TruTV reality show.

But some reality shows are ""true reality"" where the producers don't egg on drama or pick and choose what that cast should do next. These would include shows like Rob&amp;Big, Little People, Survivor*, Hells Kitchen, and some others. (*producers may choose contestant/place they think will get more viewership from but dont cause anything during the actual show)

With the Siberia show a ""contestant"" mysteriously goes missing, I mean come on it cant get more scripted than that even if the said ""constestant"" was a ploy and works for the show.

Edit: after looking the show up many tv sites are calling it out on being a ""faux reality show"", even Wikipidia has it as a [""Scripted Series about a fictional horror reality show""]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia_(TV_series))

The thing I find most disturbing is people think these blatantly faux reality shows are real.","1372638234"
