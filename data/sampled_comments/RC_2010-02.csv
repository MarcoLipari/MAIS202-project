"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt; In ME1, take a pistol with high heat generation. (Not HE rounds, though). Fire constantly. Even with the latest patch, 9/10 times if I was still firing when it overheated it would not cool down until the game was saved/reloaded. It'd happen with all my weapons, and I found quite a few others experiencing it on the net. My very first impression with the new system was that it was a joke about this bug.

I remember this bug.  I thought you were referring to something in Mass Effect 2, but most of it is actually misconception.  Many people didn't realize that enemies could use Sabotage on you to disable your weapons for a short time.

&gt; Well, I guess I should be glad it's better than gears? I'll agree it's not bad, except when trying to run away. Mouse sensitivity is about 2x what I'd like, so I whip it around like I'm playing ME1 and I end up sprinting INTO the aforementioned Krogan.. Skidding around.. Then attaching myself to this side of the crate I wanted to hide behind.

So tune down the mouse sensitivity.  I was fortunate enough to enjoy the default setting right off the bat.  Again, I found the cover system very intuitive.

&gt; Each of my four playthroughs were on the hardest available (Unlocking two, then a new one on insane). However, I did bump the difficulty down by one on the fresh playthrough after I rescued Liara, as a low level character has extreme difficulty dealing with insane enemies. On the existing character, however, I didn't have much of a problem at all - and the polonium rounds kept the Krogan from REGAINING health with their regen biotic move while I focused the inevitable second one down.

Again, you haven't played Mass Effect on Insanity or Hardcore.  Polonium rounds do nothing to stop Immunity.  You're forced to wait until it runs out for you to start doing any damage.

&gt; Nope, but isn't that the point? There's almost always a best in slot in any rpg, and you certainly don't start the game with it in ME1. I didn't have spectre gear on my first playthrough, and I was like a kid in a candy store on my fourth, where I got into the new types of hybrid weapon mods. They completely changed how my main weapon - pistol -worked, due to using two rail extensions and a snowblind round. - In fact, I started with better gear in ME2 - the DLC ones, nothing to do with my having a existing save, and I've heard people have used the Terminus armor the whole game.

For certain games, sure.  It's a nice carrot on a stick.  For Mass Effect, I'd rather the developers focused time on more important things like designing thousands of generic items you'll never touch again.

So having items that are preferential rather than straight upgrades is better.  It worked in the context of the first Mass Effect when you were gaining Spectre status.  In Mass Effect 2, it simply doesn't make sense.  You are in the process of adjusting to resurrection, but you are still one of the greatest soldiers in galactic history, with billions of dollars poured into your return and the financial backing of the entire Cerberus organization.  So you're going to tell me this organization dropped billions on bringing you back, designing you the most advanced warship in the galaxy and you still have to ""work"" your way up to better guns?  Breaks the disbelief.  Mass Effect 2 did a lot of things very well, including how many gameplay mechanics make sense with the events of the game.","1264982433"

WP Sentry allows you as the WP admin to create groups of users and allow or deny access to posts to certain groups.  You could, in theory, create a group for each ""family"" and only allow that ""family""/group access to their post.  You could put their balance on that post.

It does not. do/while is preferred because its minimum frequency is higher; ie, it will always run at least once rather than at least zero times.

GCC does prefer loops that can be decomposed with scalar evolution analysis, which pretty much just means you shouldn't do if statements based on the value of the iteration variable. Avoiding memory aliasing is also important, but `restrict` doesn't work in gcc 4.0-4.4 so you can't do that anyway.","1264982496"

Yet, I will never, ever again, be in that 'past' room again, due to the 1.6 km/hr speed of our universe as conjectured today, (hope I got that right from).

As far as funding goes, the United States sends billions every year to other countries so they can buy weapons to oppress their neighbors.  I'm glad fiscal responsibility tells us to spend more money on funding misery in the world verses saving some people from easily preventable nutritional deficiencies.

If you just said we should trust things to work out for the Ethiopians,  there wouldn't have been anything to argue about.

Large, woolen socks were placed on his hands and someone wrote ""I LOVE MITTENS"" on his chest.  We called him mittens for some time thereafter.  The coup de grâce was a pickle in a condom tucked into the back of his boxers.

I didn't see this happen, but saw him on the couch sometime early morning when I had come down to the kitchen for water.  A few hours later, I hear his door open so I pop out into the hallway and we chat long enough for others to wake up too (all the while distracting him from going to the restroom).

&gt;You say ""our culture"" but what culture are you referring to? I'm Irish living in London and I've found cultural differences even us close neighbours with the same language and a lot of the same entertainment media. 

   Ah yes, I find I have a bad tendency to confuse capitalist culture with actual culture.  That is to say, I have a false notion of us all living in a somewhat shared culture of imposed idols such as actors, athletes and politicians, advertising culture, consumer culture. 
   Whereas culture can and often is something foreign of these things.  
Im an english Canadian living in Vancouver, So although I see a lot of different culture on the outside, I don't necessarily participate in it, that is a lot of varied Asian cultures, Indian and Pakistani, some Middle Eastern and less so European immigration and African. 
  We have a good deal of sub culture that I have somewhat participated in - drug culture, music culture, art and so forth, unique to Vancouver. Of course internet culture as well is a new sort of frontier. 

&gt;If this is true, then are you saying it was ever different to this? Or wasn't it always that there are crowds of people who prefer the minority do a lot of the learning &amp; exploration and they will happily fund and follow?

Im saying it's not possible for me to know if it was ever different, So Ill suppose it was probably always this way. 
   There is a subtle point ive infused without clarifying. That is that knowledge was always considered very dangerous, perhaps the bourgeois to a lesser extent but more fundamentally the church viewed knowledge as something that must not fall into the hands of the common people - the very same with fascism and the rise of propaganda, that if the 'common people' or the 'proles', Us, ever gained access to the vastness that is human knowledge we would realize our equality and revolutionize the world. And so far things remain fundamentally the same, the same power structure, the same exploitation. 
   So its not so much that the crowd allowed the few to control them, they were goaded into it through psychological manipulation, through fear of god or force of arms. 

&gt; By the way, it's modern people or modern humanity but it hasn't been modern man in ages.

I stand corrected.

&gt; In any case, this is a classic rhetorical question with no answer at all.

True, only used the Greece reference as one of the foundations of the idea of the Republic and freedom of thought, the birthplace of western philosophy. Trying to appeal to your emotions ;P

&gt;Although you may be right about the education system, I don't believe you are right in thinking that this represents our willingness to learn. People may not always want to know ""the truth"" but I find that people do want to continue to learn, particularly those who are prevented from it.

Yes it seems that when something is is forbidden it is sweeter, I touched on this in the paragraph above and I want to tie my reply into some other things you said ...

&gt; I hear classical music because that's the station I choose.
&gt; I avoid ads but I agree that there are way too many ads. However, there are movements against these and places where there are no ads.
&gt; And then there's freedom, which you define in terms of politics alone.
&gt; Freedom is being able to move - mentally, physically and emotionally. A person in a jail cell can have a free mind.

Indeed freedom is all about choice, and I reconcile freedom with government because it seems to be lagging behind, because of the nature of the human race and this notion being discussed about - to put this bluntly and arrogantly - quite stupid, and happy that way.

  Now, usually I don't defend myself because offended people are much more honest, but I respect you so in the spirit of life in its true form, that is dancing, polarity, resonance, ill tell you that I know im not in the clouds with some men, Eg. Nietzche or more modern Zizek, nor artistically like Poe, Shakespeare ect ect. Ill (probably  [probably only because im not the same man I was yesterday, it would really be arrogant to assume I knew a man ive never met, my future self]) never be a great philosopher or thinker, but ill do my damned best.
  I see myself as what the bare minimum should be for intellect in our society, and its disheartening to see such a lack of enthusiasm from those I encounter everyday. 

  It seems government lags behind because of this - that if 51% of people don't give a damn if their system is corrupt it screws it up for the rest of us, this is how society, government, and culture become stirred together. So while we do have the limited freedom of personal choice, we are powerless in this system to create any real change, save some catalyzing hero to stimulate the masses. 
 
I deny only that this is pessimistic, for I see it as accurate. Narrow mindedness has always been a fault of mine. 

Might I bother you for your thoughts on this notion ?

Here are some tips you can give this gentlemen to improve upon this webpage:

* Move all of the CSS into a single, external stylesheet.  It's easier to maintain and change one file as opposed to 4+.  Also, for some reason he attempted to comment out the CSS with &lt;!-- --&gt;?
* **CSS**: Use more specific CSS selectors, general names like ""class1"" etc are very hard to maintain if anyone else is to ever edit this site.  If class1 makes the text red and bold, then try a name like ""redbold"", etc.
* **Flash**: Don't use Flash for the navigation.  This is one you have to insist on.  It's incredibly unnecessary, and it's going to shoot your dad in the foot.  Why?  Most importantly, because the iPhone and other mobile browsers can't do flash.  When I'm out with my friends and we're looking for a restaurant, I'll usually pull out my iPhone and look for their website and menu.  If you can't see the navigation to get to the menu, then uh-oh.
* **Frames**: I don't understand the point of the pretty much null frame.  Someone fill me in here?
* **HTML Tables**: Don't get me started, but tables are very restrictive and haven't been the proper recognized way to make layouts since before most of us were in middle school.

They specifically aren't good at memory operations (either array operations or doing a lot of stuff with struct members), because they think a lot of random other parts of the code introduce memory aliasing when they don't. That's what happens here.","1264982660"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Here is how I see it.  People who think that their lawyers are ""the best"" probably had a good outcome with their case.  It doesn't necessarily mean they are the best, it just means that they are competent.  For most legal matters, you don't need the best.  You just need somebody that is competent.  There are plenty of competent lawyers in every city who would achieve the same result if given your case.  That is why it is important to  speak with multiple people and research their recommendations or go in for a consultation yourself.  You need to find the attorney that is right for you.   

I can't imagine anybody recommending someone who is not competent just to save face for their bad decision making.  I would like to hope that your friends/family would have your best interests in mind when dispensing advice related to an important legal matter.

"Atlanta","t5_2qiq9","First, thanks so much for that map.  I have been unable to find such a map and it will be really helpful as I am currently working on a school project to study possible ways to make MARTA more successful.  

DISCLAIMER:  I am not an attorney or other licensed professional, nor have I gotten to the point of the project that I can even say I have done due diligence to the point that anything contained in this post should be taken as authoritative.  However, it provides me the opportunity to get some brainstorming done, and, hopefully, y’all can learn something about what I consider one of the most important issues facing our city.  

As for your question, the short answer is that MARTA (or another agency tied in with MARTA infrastructure) will eventually have to provide additional mass transit because our roads are already beyond capacity to the point of hindering growth.  Hopefully, the Beltline project will spur interest in transit-oriented planning.  Of course, those corridors are merely proposed and would not be built in exactly that form, should they be built at all.

As for progress, there has been very little, but that is changing.  There is a bill before the Legislature this session that will allow the regions to impose their own public transport taxes.  One of the biggest problems facing MARTA is that legislators from outside the city do not want to be seen to support a city-only project.  I am not sure how long you have live here, but the “Two Georgias” problem is a very real political problem.  This new bill will alleviate that problem; however, MARTA is only supported by Fulton and Dekalb counties within the Atlanta region.  Without support of the entire region, MARTA will be unable to grow.  

Growing support in the Atlanta region will prove difficult.  There are over a hundred local governments in the region.  While the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) is a politically powerful organization, it lacks the legal power to get much done.  I believe ARC is presenting in class tomorrow, so I can expand on this point tomorrow evening.  GRTA, on the other hand, has a lot of legal power (you need GRTA permission for a curb cut to install a driveway) and, iirc, $2B of bonding authority.  That means that GRTA could, in theory, issue $2B of debt without having to ask the legislature.  The problem with GRTA-led development is that it is common knowledge that the Legislature would shut GRTA down if it actually used its legal power.  

So, the issue comes down to getting support from the other counties in the Atlanta Region.  This is a very difficult political task.  The demographics of the MARTA ridership are very different from the suburban commuters who are necessary to justify expanding MARTA.  One thing that can be done is to put more capable people in charge of the MARTA Police.  According to a friend on the APD, the Five Points Rail Station is the favorite hangout of known gang members anywhere in the city.  While I don’t see much evidence of crime occurring in and around the station (or even notice gang members loitering), commuters are not going to want to change trains at a station associated with gangs.  

Of course, the biggest problem with MARTA is that it doesn’t go anywhere.  I plan on focusing most of my project on solving this issue.  It is my opinion that MARTA will not be able to expand until (almost) every rail station serves a true “destination.”  If you go to most rail stations, you will find that they are surrounded by surface parking.  I plan on proposing that MARTA strive to completely move away from surface parking.  

There should be, at least, two models used for station development.  First, the suburban stations at or near the end of lines should be designed to facilitate dual-mode commutes.  While dual-mode commutes are neither popular nor ideal, MARTA has had success with the idea.  Commuters who live near a station have shown that they are willing to drive to a station and take the train into the city to avoid traffic.  I am not sure, but I am pretty sure that the traffic starts farther out than North Springs.  Of course, there are no MARTA stations remotely close to millions of people in the suburbs.  This gets us back into a discussion of building stations with money MARTA doesn’t have, many of which will need to be in non-MARTA counties, so more stations are not an immediate solution.  

In the city, MARTA, along with the City Council, Mayor’s Office, ARC, and many other governmental entities, needs to focus on transit-oriented development.  We need to find an effective way to promote high-density development around MARTA stations.  Plain and simple, people that own cars are not going to take a train into the city if they will have to get on a bus to get to their destination.  Therefore, we need destinations within walking distance of rail stations.  The downtown stations have decent destinations by being located in a dense area.  Midtown is also in decent shape, and, once the economy recovers, I would assume that the Midtown growth boom will continue.  Lindbergh station is actually well-respected in the planning community as an example of successful transportation oriented development(TOD), and you can see that the development associated with the station is not even that extensive.  

However, stations on the South side, pretty much the entire East-West rail line, and several stations on the North Side are just surrounded by parking.  I swear you can walk from East Point Station to Ft. Mac Station without ever leaving a parking lot.  We need to encourage development physically attached to the stations, preferably with covered (climate controlled?) walkways so people can get into the buildings without going out in bad weather.  This development can be anything: condos, office space, retail.  As a Midtown resident and New Urbanism kind of guy, I would hope for mixed-use development.  With destinations at each stop, ridership will rise to levels necessary to justify expansion.  Additionally, more riders means more voters who support MARTA and can put political pressure on state and local governments to extend the service area.  

Of course, we are talking about an agency that is so broke that it can barely afford to run busses, much less fund development on its own.  There are several alternatives.  My preferred solution is to encourage developer finance for TODs.  The most common method is to give a five(or so) year property tax waiver to developers who build TODs.  Another method I’ve been exploring is that MARTA could literally give developers the parking lots subject to conditions that they would build TODs and provide MARTA parking in their decks or lease the lots with consideration being construction of the TOD and MARTA parking.  Finally, MARTA does have some capital improvement funding that cannot be used for operations.  This money could be used to fund some TODs, especially if the agency wanted to build another “demo TOD” like Lindbergh Station.  

I hope this was helpful and/or interesting.  As you can see, I am very early into the project, so I don’t really have many sources or data yet.  That being said, feel free to ask me anything you want.  Reddit posts are as good a method as brainstorming as anything else, and you may give me a good idea, which I will cite to, if possible.

The verse people most often use to argue a literalist interpretation is the ol' ""God-breathed, and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness,"" but nowhere in that verse does it say that every word of the Bible is meant to be interpreted literally.

You're indeed correct - Abbas has set a pre-condition: stop building and expanding the fucking settlements.

As a pre-condition, I don't think this is unreasonable.

And you're wrong about Netanyahu - he has already listed a series of demands he expects the Palestinians to meet (although the Israeli spin doctors are saying these are negotiable and not pre-conditions).

It appears that the Americans and Egyptians are trying to find a formula that will work and even Israeli political scientists are saying something is in the air.

But to characterize this as all black and white - the Palestinians are ruining everything and the Israelis are all sweetness and light - is just wrong.

It shouldn't take long until she is begging for it. Don't give it to her. Call her your toy, or pet. Tell her that she is yours and you can do what you want. ""Who's tits are these?"", ""who's clit is this"" until she says they are yours. 
Reward and punishment are always good. When something is not perfectly to your liking (perhaps when she is giving head), stop and correct preferably with pinches and strkes to the ass, thigh and back if she has a sensitive back.  Keep in mind once the skin has reddened it is much more sensitive, soft strokes, nails and occasional pinches will get a dramatic reaction. 
just controlling her head can add an edge to sex. a firm grip in the back of her neck, or on her Jaw, making her or preventing her from kissing you.  A possessive comment whispered in her ear.  
Take time, a lot of time, use it to make he feel as if you can make her feel anything you want, and if you study her reactions you can. 
Training is also a lot of fun. Think pet, reward is sexual stimulation and punishment is lack of stimulation or pain.  But as always you are in charge and sometimes you have to punish just because you enjoy it. 
Don't be afraid of telling her how much you like it. Tell her how pretty she is when you punish her too. Make it graphic. She makes you do it. It is her fault you know.

"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","Thanks for taking the time to explain your position. It's refreshing to debate an issue without having the opposing side resort to name-calling (which seems to happen an awful lot on Reddit).

&gt;The reason why equating this to taxation is absurd is because this is a small group of people, not the vast majority of our society. Having your property taken by a small group of people because they feel like it isn't the same as having your property taken by the government on a regular basis because you've agreed to it.

Another way of saying that is, ""Having your property taken by a small group of people isn't the same as having your property taken by a large group of people."" Your argument boils down to this, if the majority of a small group of people want to take your possessions by force and give them to the poor it is wrong. But if the majority of a large group of people want to take your possessions by force and give them to the poor, it is ok. 

It's really a matter of semantics. What constitutes a ""large"" group? If the majority of the people in your town voted to take your possessions would that be enough? Or the majority of the people in your county? Or your state? You see, when you start to sacrifice individual rights to majority rule things tend to get murky. 

&gt;...having your property taken by the government on a regular basis because you've agreed to it.

I've agreed to no such thing. Like tens of millions of other Americans, I give them my money because if I don't they will send men with guns to my home to lock me up. 

&gt;Why must you use the force of government to accomplish your goals? If the majority of people really support your goals as you contend, why not just do it on a voluntary basis?
&gt;&gt;Because that doesn't work. If it did, we wouldn't have to tax people for social programs in the first place because there would be no need.

Ask yourself why it doesn't work on a voluntary basis. If the majority of people want to support government social programs for the poor (as you contend), there would be massive voluntary support of such a system. If on the other hand the majority of people really don't want to support government social programs (as evidenced by your admission that it wouldn't work on a voluntary basis), then how do you justify taking their money by force (that would mean a minority of people forcing the majority to do something against their will)? Do you see how you've painted yourself into a corner there? If it's really the will of the majority then it shouldn't take force to accomplish it.

When you're thinking about these issues, please remember that libertarians aren't against helping poor or disadvantaged people (that would be more of an Objectivist position). We just feel that private charity is more moral (i.e. it doesn't take people's money by force) and more efficient than social programs mandated by the state. ","1264982773"

that above advice is baaad - seriously if my dude did that to me I'd get that piece of clothing and whip him with it

I'm female, my weight fluctuates - this time last year i was a size 6, right now i'm closer to a large 8 or size 10 (in america i think that's like going from size 0 - 4 maybe). Despite the fact that I still fall into what is mostly acceptable in the way of looks and size I still feel like the fattest heffer on the face of the planet. I feel morbidly fucking obese right now and my bf decided to start telling me to lose weight sure I would - but it probably wouldn't be in a healthy way and it would create all kinds of issues between us. 

Bottom line - we are VERY fucking aware when we have put on weight, seriously - I know if i've put on a kilo. We don't need our bfs or gfs (if that's how you roll) telling us when we fucking do.

First how do you look? Could you stand to lose a few? Could you tone up and look a touch more like one of those... i don't know 'buff' types? How would you feel if your girl came home one night and said ""oh btw to be honest, not really finding you THAT attractive right now, think you could do something about muscling up for me?""

better idea - why not start eating healthier and working out yourself, she will most likely follow suit - it might take a few weeks but trust me she will. My bf thankfully is still pudgier than I and he recently started working out and eating healthier, it's been influencing me to eat healthier and work out a little more instead of starving myself to lose weight. 

TL; DR - Duuude - waaaaaay fucking uncool, no fucking way - do not do that. Instead try leading by example and eating better/working out, she will end up doing the same.","1264982832"

Yes.  There were usually a few kids here and there.  It was a great place for them because there were so many pools, and the innocence that comes with being a child.  We had over 500 year round residents in the houses on campus, so a lot of them had kids.  

&gt;Are single men allowed to join?

Yes, and No.  There were background checks to get membership.  We sold day passes and single men were not allowed to get day passes.  They could get membership.  If you had a woman with you you could get in for the day.

&gt;When you saw fat old people naked, how many times did it take you to get over it and see them as nice and normal?

I would just keep eye contact, and it wasn't so bad.  I think I got used to the idea of everyone being naked pretty quickly.  When everyone is naked I actually felt strange wearing clothes, like I was the one doing something taboo.  

&gt;What was the quotient of show-off, exhibitionist types vs regular people just wanting be naked?

I will assume you mean ratio?  There were a lot of exhibitionists there.  I would say the majority of 'normal' nudists would only stay around the resort area for the sun hours as people really started drinking at night.  Some of the more strict naturalists never even came to the resort they just lived there because they could have the lifestyle they wanted.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Nothing favors wealth, not work, more neatly than the tax break on capital gains. President Clinton lowered the tax on long-term gains to 20 percent. President Bush cut it again, to 15 percent, little more than half the rate paid by middle-class Americans on their wages. Bush's action pushed the rate to a 70-year low; it's now at 77 years and counting, going back to 1933.

Middle class people must not own stocks or bonds I guess. 

Low capital gains tax favors capital accumulation leading to expansion of the capital stock, more capital per worker, and therefore more output per worker. Author disregards the fact that both capital and labor are components of a production function and we have to assign some value to the use of capital just as we assign value to labor through wages. 

&gt; Only a trace amount of all the churning on Wall Street grows anything. Small companies with big dreams raise seed money through initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary offerings. These investments deserve a bigger tax break than they get now; there's a strong case for making them tax-free. All other stock market gains should be taxed the same as wages (which they were, back when).

The fact that there are IPOs, secondary offerings, and repeated debt offerings are contingent on an actual secondary market existing for the stuff. You dry up demand on the secondary market through hiking capital gains tax and you can expect that its going to have a negative effect on the health of the primary market. 

This is an aside from the fact that there is considerable risk putting your own money up to own shares of a given stock or purchase a bond. There seems to be a perception that these assets only appreciate when they don't (often for years at a time or never). 

&gt; Tax breaks on Wall Street gains (except as noted) fail three fiscal policy tests. They serve no purpose. They're a limitless drain on the Treasury. And they're inequitable: they favor wealth, not work. Income is income, and should be taxed the same no matter where it comes from.

I can agree that tax breaks on wall street serve no purpose in the long run. However, the notion that a low capital gains tax is implicitly a ""break"" for wall street is an utter joke. Capital gains taxes are going to affect most people with an actual rate of savings, and more broadly, the future job market.","1264982859"

Unions have negotiated for contracts which will automatically increase pay rates based on minimum wage.  People may be making 10%, 100% or 500% over minimum wage.

So, when the minimum wages goes up, a lot of people's pay rates go up proportionately, causing employers to raise prices.  Competitive forces will cause general prices to rise.

* Larger hit boxes.

* Slower walking speed, doesn't allow you to move as quickly without making any noise.

Basically, CSS is more random and more friendly to novice players.  Valve has been continuing this trend for a long time.  1.6 had bigger hit boxes than 1.5 and added equipment like the tactical shield.  Then there was a patch for 1.6 released in late 2003 or early 2004 that made the recoil for M4 and AK more random and added AWP scope delay.

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","Since there are only 4, I'll just explain them, as each of them is very different:

The University Youth Shelter: This one is the random church basement night one, but each church is assigned a night. Most of the nights haven't changed in the 10 years I've been around, so most kids have them memorized. At this one, your name is not run, but I still feel like it's counterproductive as it doesn't feel stable.. there are no showers. Each night you show up, and they have these two inch pads, a sheet, a hospital blanket and a pillow. You take one of each, and pick out a spot on the floor. I think Saturday nights has a few cots too. When I first started getting off the streets I came here a lot, as it was the easiest transition off of the streets. Most nights are 16 or so to 24 I think, but some nights were only 14-18 too back then. I'm just including seattle youth ministries in this as they were almost identical, they just do the under 18 nights and have showers. They had a room though put aside, instead of a basement.. so they have a drop in too during the day. Here's a pic of sym: http://www.streetyouthministries.org/images/SYM-About.jpg Kinda quaint, up on 47th and 15th.

Denny Place: This was the only one downtown. You had to have a clean record to stay here, and they accepted kids 16 and over. They made you take a shower and wash your clothes when you stayed here, which was absolutely unacceptable to me. I just hated wasting every night doing that, so I never stayed here. They had two rooms, one for girls and one for boys with 8 beds in each, but now they just serve boys. This was the closest shelter to how I imagined them. On one wall there was a giant closet, and it was filled with donation clothes. You could just take whatever you wanted. I found one of my favorite button up shirts there as a kid, and near the door they had a bookshelf you could just take books from. That's where I discovered lord of the rings. Most shelters were more choosey about where they gave the donations.

Youthcare: I stayed here the longest, about 3 months. They are out in the U village. It's a very sterile place, they also run a lot of transitional houses though, and they kept me housed for years. I had to jump through a lot of stupid hoops, but they really helped me out the most. At that place, you would get buzzed in by a camera and usually have to explain who you were to it. Then you would go up a bunch of really sterile smelling stairs, and there was this big front room type area with a kitchen. There was also an office, with tons of windows so they could see everything. Then the rooms were in hallways off to the side. Almost everyone got their own room, but some people shared them. All the furniture was connected to the walls. Here's a pic of one of the dining room of one of the houses I stayed at for years, ISIS: http://www.youthcare.org/images/uploads/table_setting.jpg They just always have this sterile look. This place was also 14-18, but you had to have a clean record.. I convinced my mom to clear it so I could stay here. They did make me shower twice a week to stay here, it was a big deal to them.

Teen Hope: This place was up in Shoreline, by Costco. It was in a house, and they tried to make it homely.. almost too much. I stopped staying here because the family type dinners every night freaked me out. They had a normal front room, couch.. you would never guess it was a shelter if you just walked in. There were three bed rooms, each with three beds.. most of them had one bunch bed and one normal bed. It just sorta depended on which sex they had more of.. it changed around a lot if there were more girls or guys. This place was 14-18, but didn't like my run away report. I also got annoyed at how often they told me I would be raped on the streets.","1264982960"

What does blindly embrace atheism mean? Not having a belief in gods (which have no evidence) for no reason?

&gt; Religion is not the problem, it's the shared belief in something what causes turmoil.

That is just stupid. Beliefs do not causes turmoil. How people allow their beliefs to influence their behavior is what leads to turmoil. Religion is an influencing factor in how people behave but not the only one. Beliefs don't kill people, idiots with beliefs kill people.

&gt; The average man will try to find in atheism the same kind of reassurance others find in conventional faiths. And that will inevitably lead to hate, radicalization and intolerance.

What reassurances are obtained from not having a belief in any gods and how do those reassurances lead to hate, radicalizations and intolerance?

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","**TL;DR: I invited Jehovah's Witnesses in, let them try their hand at me and they have been visiting me regularly with no success for over 3 years**

After some years of dismissal in varying degrees in varying degrees of curtness or politeness (depending on my mood), I found myself opening the door to a man and a woman, who promptly launched into their spiel.  I was about to give them a pleasant dismissal when I stopped for a moment.

I am (and realized early on that I always have been) a die-hard rationalist.  Call it atheist, call it agnostic...I don't care.  What it means is that I don't *believe* anything.  Show me evidence of something and I'll accept it's factuality.  Show me a theory that makes sense and I'll apply it till something better comes along.  Give me convincing evidence that  you are more experienced than me in a given area and I will guardedly accept your word on the topic of your expertise (until I find a flaw or obvious falsehood).  I've seen no evidence that this aspect of my personality is shakeable in any way.  

I also genuinely like and believe in people.  I want people to have what they desire, within reason.  But religion confuses me.  How can someone spend their entire lives confining themselves to a set of behaviors based on text with no factual evidence to support it?

I reflected that, as it happened, I *did* have some time to spare.  It was my day off, I lived alone at the time, and I had not yet begun my day.  I wondered what would happen if I simply let them exhaust themselves trying to convert me.  No abuse, no intentional trapping of them in logical riddles, but also no giving ground, no accepting of anything that can't be proven and no accepting their definitions of morality.

I found myself saying: 'Yes, I do have some time to talk.  Would you like to come in?'

They came in, and I offered them everything at my disposal. 'Tea? Water? Beer? Whiskey? Food?'  I would not deign to accept their belief that my whiskey was in any way inferior to my water or my tea.

For the next 90 minutes, I sat with them and talked.  They of course attempted to lead me to their faith, and I in my place attempted to lead them to reason without ridiculing them.  I am a reasonably able debater, but this was a challenge.  Not because their logic was impeccable (it was not), but because the restraint of politeness and openness I had placed on myself forced me to avoid obvious logical traps and technicalities.  

Finally the man looked at his watch, thanked me for my time, and told me they had friends waiting for them in the car (were they waiting there the whole time?).   Then he surprised me by saying: 'I've really enjoyed this talk.  May we continue it again?'  

I told him that this was my regular day off.  They would be welcome to call upon me, and if I'm there I'll answer.  Sure enough, *they returned the next week*.

That was 3 years ago.  Sometimes they'll come every week for several weeks, sometimes 2 months will go by without me seeing them.  For the first several months it would be the same guy with a different attractive mid-20s woman of a different race each time, but then I began dating my girlfriend and mentioned her regularly.  After that, he switched to bringing an older parent or grandparent like figure.  I never pretend to be anything other than what I am: an unashamed rationalist.  When I was single, and I would mention that I was going out later that night, they would say 'good luck' and I would say 'thanks, I'm hoping to fornicate tonight.'

Eventually I moved about 2 miles away, *and I even gave them my new address*.  My girl I've been with for 2 years now is also an atheist, but much less interested in theology.  Out of respect for me, she is polite to them, but she also makes clear that if I'm not around, they should come back later.

In all this time, they have had exactly zero effect on my internal position re: religion.  I still view it as a mimetic disease I happen to have an immunity to.  But they offer me a fascinating glimpse into the mind of religious people, as I avoid the subject with the few people I know who are that way to prevent conflict.

Slightly true (do to your obfuscating). The artificial disabling of flash limits you. That is all there is to it. You can say that there are problems with flash but making it not work is to keep people buying apps and that is it. 

You sound like you are a developer. I don't get why you don't even try to comment on flash not being allowed on Apples mobile platform. That's the conversation we are actually having.

You'd be able to give less than 100%, which would basically ruin your first meetup.  That would suck.

I don't know if that's what is going through her head, but it may be?  Either way, it's kinda mean for you to say ""well, I don't care at all about how you're actually feeling, because you SHOULD be feeling this way.""  I know it is frustrating to feel like you aren't the most important thing in her life, but you aren't.  Actually, it seems like she isn't the most important thing in yours as you aren't willing to put her feelings first in this matter.

But yeah, you had a fight.  Fights are hard LDR because cutting communication off (basically running from the fight) is so easy.  And you both are.  You might think you aren't, but that line ""come and find me when you're ready"" is just downright cruel.  Why not try ""Hey, I'm sorry, let's please talk about this.

You really can't afford to say stuff like that in LDR, because you're basically counting on her to make that trek.  She may not.

So yes, you screwed up.  But she still cares about you.  Get a trip to see her to happen, stay open, compassionate and loving with her.  Try to remain mature and calm.  But most of all, try to figure out why she's doing the things she is and help THAT.","1264983059"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The First thing that comes to mind happened near the end of my busing shift a few years back. We had only one table at the end of the night, and since I knew them it wasn't really a big deal for me to unset the other tables. First I went around, collecting all the silverware rolls, and the second time around I grabbed all the bread plates. Just as I'm nearing the bus station with, say, a stack of just over 35 plates, the guy starts bullshitting with me, and I notice he just finished his app. Do I wait to put my plates down before grabbing it? No, because it's late and I need to get this guy going on his next course so I can leave. So I hold the stack of plates with my right hand, and grab his app with my left, but as I lean in, the stack of plates becomes more unstable than intended.   
  
Ninja shit.  
They fall, but I manage to save all 35 by crouching and sliding my right elbow unnaturally far behind my back, pinning them to my body. He near shat himself, and ended up tipping me a buck per plate","1264983090"

Your ""pro tip"" formula seemed to imply that you would fill your life with sinful pleasures. The problem is that both orthodox Christians and secular humanists agree on what constitutes ""sin"" in terms of hurting the self and others. Under Christianity, ""sin"" is not merely that which violates arbitrary imperatives. The New Covenant is all about consequential action in service of the ""kingdom of God"" which, in a Venn diagram, overlaps strongly with humanism (since God's benevolence is in terms of his desire to optimize mankind's freedom and satisfaction over the long run).

&gt;small, easy, unassuming and uncomplicated - the exact opposite of any modern DSLR.

Aka, less customizable. These things are great, but don't explain the price.


&gt;Don't even get me started on the merits of shooting fast prime lenses that are sharper than the devil's tongue

The 5d has a better sensor. So sharp lenses on the leica are limited by the lack of detail the sensor produces. Besides, (you can use leica lenses on a 5d II) &lt;- edit: redacted.


&gt;all without compromise due to the lack of retrofocus issues

Wow. Nice stretch. See, it doesn't have autofocus issues *because it doesn't have autofocus.*

If I have AF issues, I can turn off the AF and save **$9,000.**


&gt; I also think they're priced fairly

They're priced like a Leica.

It's a luxury item because of the utility it had in the street-photography days of Cartier-Bresson. 

They are no longer a luxury item, no longer without competition, and the price is being held up primarily by hipsters who want the red badge.


&gt;Scanned negs still beat the shit out of digital

No, they don't.

When you compare format-to-format, digital wins. Leaf backs beat medium format film (**Edit:** after some research, I've discovered that the 1ds III and 5d II also handily defeat medium format), and Canon's last 3 full-frame bodies have beat the IQ of 35mm film *even at ISO 100*.

Digital surged ahead of film in terms of color accuracy nearly a decade ago.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Thanks for replying.  I'll share my experience of panic as well:  I was at home eating dinner, while my grandmother was upstairs fixing up my younger brother's room.  I heard a loud noise, as if something fell, and ran up to see what happened.  She had been standing on a chair to clean above the windows or something and fell and hit her wrist on the metal edge of the bed.  She showed me the wrist: ~-shaped instead of - shaped.  At this sight, I definitely panicked - I had never seen a bodily injury like this before, and nobody else was home, so I called 911.  While this is never a bad thing, to call 911 in an emergency, I should have realized her injury wasn't life threatening and didn't require an ambulance or 911.  In retrospect I could've called the neighbor to drive her to the hospital, or the non-emergency line, or a cab, or whatever.  I think, however, this is anecdotal evidence that the mind goes with what it knows, and shuts out creative thought when under stress.  

Interesting too, that 911 works best when you are informative and obedient to the operator.  This is also exactly what the panicked brain wants: to be told what to do if it can't draw from experience or lessons.  The fact that this guy called 911 shouldn't be used as evidence of his stupidity, but rather evidence that he had probably literally ran out of ideas, and was outsourcing the thinking to someone who is trained not to panic and solve problems.

Think about Sully.  He didn't land successfully because he's a genius or creative or he's a real man or what have you.  He was able to land because in panic mode, you draw from experience, and his experience was immense in that area, both airplanes and gliders and I think he may have had more training with water simulation as well.  He was practically the best pilot to have flying a plane in that situation - not because of his incredible thinking power, or his abnormal mode of dealing with panic, but because he was prepared for that moment, and entered the situation with plenty of experience, knowledge, and even knowledge of how to use the knowledge (emergency procedures) that he and the co-pilot were able to leverage. 

To find an example where this type of thinking was used but didn't work, compare these two wikpedia articles: [Airliner accidents and incidents caused by mechanical failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Airliner_accidents_and_incidents_caused_by_mechanical_failure) with [Aviation accidents and incidents officially attributed to pilot error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_officially_attributed_to_pilot_error).  These cases, where human error is the cause, are examples of the limitations of narrow, focused, depth-first thinking when it comes to solving problems outside of the person's knowledge or experience.  A plane has too many variables for a pilot to memorize every possible combination of simultaneous failures, so instead they have a system of dealing with emergencies that works pretty well, and they follow it to a T.  This type of problem-solving works well for quickly finding the known fix to a known problem - but absolutely fails at coming up with creative solutions to unpredictable problems.  

If you ignore the profound effect that panic has on the way the brain thinks about problems, and instead blame it all on the individual and their stupidity or clumsiness, then you have to conclude that every pilot listed on that page just weren't smart enough to fly their plane.  They all somehow snuck by the licensing board, and got a license while being complete dummies.  Just as this officer here was too dumb to stop his car.  This attitude is neither in touch with reality nor right.","1264983172"

I'd donate to PSKS, teen feed or the university youth shelter (I'm honestly not sure if the second two even do donations, they are mostly volunteer run).

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","&gt;Yeah. That's what I can't understand. 

I don't understand either, to be honest. I would happily eat eggs if they came from my own pet chickens, in fact I plan on keeping some of my own when I get my own place. Keeping hens is not really viable in a college dorm, heh.

However there are multiple problems with ""free range"" eggs. First of all the term is very loosely regulated, so there are plenty of so-called free range farms that are not much better than battery farms (see this for example http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/wp-content/uploads/chickens.jpg). And of course the hens are slaughtered like any other when they are no longer productive; there's no ""retirement home"" for spent hens.

But the more fundamental issue is the killing of male chicks at hatcheries. Since the males don't they eggs, they are useless to the industry and literally ground up alive once their sex is determined.  Even at the largely mythical ""humane"" egg farm, there's no way around this problem. Even if the male chicks weren't killed, they would probably just be raised for meat; I sincerely doubt there's a demand for hundreds of millions of pet roosters. 

For that reason I don't think a commercial egg farm could ever truly be both cruelty-free AND economically profitable. It would be extremely expensive to keep roosters/old hens alive when they don't produce anything in return.","1264983260"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; Let's take one for an example. Welfare (in all its forms, and there are many). It creates a hurdle to overcome because of how it's always implemented. If you make below a certain amount, you get state assistance. If you make above a certain amount, you get nothing.

I can't comment about American welfare systems, but in Australia at least some of the welfare systems scale with income. Two I'm aware of are the rent payable on government provided housing and student welfare received while undergoing tertiary education.

I agree that many forms of welfare are, as you describe, implemented as *all or nothing* and that this is not helping, and contributes to wage slavery, but I don't think such welfare systems *have* to be this way. Welfare in *many* of its forms is as you describe, but certainly not *all*; it's not *always* implemented in this way (and should not be).

The responsible way to implement welfare is to ensure that an individual or family's income (including welfare) is monotonically increasing as a function of their wages. This requires all welfare payments to be scaled to income, with the reduction of welfare being less than the increase in income.

This makes the welfare system *genuinely* in the interest of the welfare recipients, not a system of enslaving them in a welfare 'potential well'.","1264983261"

Hagman has a lot of skill and really good hands.  Pair him with other talented players and I think he'll keep up, or improve his production in Calgary.  Ian White is a great up and coming puck moving defenseman and he works his ass off every game.  Watching those two players will probably make a lot of Flames fans happy, especially those who weren't sold on Phaneuf.

* Went for Miranda.  No question I would after I finished Freedom's Progress with her.  Classy, sexy, intelligent and talented.
* Suicide mission was anti-climactic.  Would've wanted some more variation.  Example:  Protect a fire team from an elevated position while they get to an objective, arming time required for the nuke, disarming booby traps, etc.  For such a hyped up event, it was pitifully simple and easy.  Send a tech guy, fight through door, protect biotic, kill boss.  Done.
* Main questline was incredibly short, which was the same problem with ME1.  Why were the protheans turned into Collectors?  How did the derelict Reaper get there?  Why not add some more exploration and quests to the main story?  Essentially it boiled down to this: Tutorial, Collector Ship, IFF, Collector Base.  That was it.  That was the entire main story.
* Side missions were a huge step forward, and getting rid of the Mako was just heavenly.  They need some more scripted events, voice acting and important side mission quests and the next game will be perfect.

And this other thing is a small, but still very annoying gripe.

The character I ported over from ME1 was a Colonist/Sole Survivor.  He knew that the reason why his entire marine platoon died on Akuze was because Cerberus orchestrated the thresher maw attacks.  He calls out Cerberus for experimenting with husks, Thorian creepers and rachni, but doesn't say a peep about Akuze.  You would think a guy finding out that the organization that killed all of his best friends were the same ones that ressurected him would have a lot to say...  The most confusing part is when Jacob asked me about the event point blank on the shuttle to meet the Illusive Man, and Cerberus' involvement never came up.  And it failed to come up a second time when I received an e-mail from Corporal Toombs.

Also, some ship upgrades have a direct impact on gameplay, like being able to hold more fuel, house more probes and scan planets faster.  Everything else is to help your team survive the mission.  If your whole team is loyal, your ship fully upgraded and your team assignments sound, the whole crew will survive.","1264983294"

But his character really grew on me, especially as we got to know more about him.  He ended up being one of the most interesting characters, because you saw him go from a happy-go-lucky guy just interested in science, to suddenly developing some serious misgivings when he realizes the end-game at play.  In episode 13, i was at first put off by how he ""went crazy"", thinking this was pretty silly.  But again the idea grew on me.. the way he didn't really think about the consequences of his actions until it slapped him in the face, it becomes a believable idea that he could completely lose the ability to deal with anything outside his own head... he was socially awkward to begin with.  I was sad that he died.. I didn't think that he really needed to be the one to set off the device, or that they couldn't rig up a wireless trigger.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Depends on your crowd and the type of party.  Personally, I like **Hot Apple Cider**.  My recipe is (makes about 5 gallons):

Put big pot on stove, turn to medium.  At bottom, drop a half stick of butter and 1 cup brown sugar, stir until thick caramel forms.  Don't let it burn.

Dump in 4 gallons of a apple cider (whatever you can get at the grocery store, usually in the produce section - because that's where more local / organic juices are found).  Also dump in mulling spices (in a muslin bag) - these are usually in the soda isle and most stores carry them in winter, it adds a nice touch.  If you don't add the mulling spices, a little cinnamon can be a nice alternative, but both are totally optional.

You don't have to bring it to a boil, personally I just set it back to low heat and give it at least 30 minutes to gel together before folks are set to arrive.  If you want it as an alcoholic drink, add 1 bottle of whatever you want (I like a 1/2 Captain 1/2 Jack mix, but some folks prefer SoCo for the sweetness, and bourbon, though expensive, is a really nice touch).  Muscadine wine (but use two bottles) can be cool too - if you live in the south and can get decent stuff.  Add the alcohol right as people are arriving, you don't want it to all evaporate off.  Sometimes I'll toss an apple in there, just so folks know what the hell it is.  Enjoy.

PS:  I did this for a New Years party which my friend hosted (he's a big-time Redditor who got me to xfer from Digg).  He did a bacon-everything theme, so I brought bacon guac and this cider... with a twist.  I tossed in 1/4 pack of bacon during the caramelizing process.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Okay:

1) Stay on topic. Provide maybe 1-3 sentences of background, then say what you are going to talk about and what point you are trying to make, then talk about it. 

2) Make sure that transitions or logical links between topics are well defined. 

Paragraph one of your post is pretty good, actually. It looks like you're about to make the case that China needs more land because they don't have enough farmland to feed their entire population. I would dispute the point, but that's neither here nor there. You've picked a topic, and you're about to argue your case.

Then paragraph two comes along.

&gt;Cutting to the chase, these actions are a direct reaction to dwindling supply of everything that is necessary to run a consumer capitalist world... and yet knowingly (you're out of your mind if you believe these corporations don't realize the former) we continue on this linear (wasteful) death-trap of consumer oriented capitalism (planned obsolescence).

I have no idea what this is trying to say. I'll rewrite it in my own words and see if I can get the gist.  
China's actions are a response to finite resources, the finiteness of which is a result of our economic system; corporations know that we have finite resources, and yet they consume them linearly **(&lt;--pretty sure you meant ""exponentially""?)**, and wastefully **(you have this adjective right next to linearly, I'm not sure if that is to imply that goods consumed linearly are being used wastefully?)**. Further, consumer oriented capitalism will lead all of us to our deaths, and companies make products that are designed to be obsolete within years.

See how that's confusing? What do you mean by, ""linearly,"" why is that associated with ""wasteful,"" and what exactly do you mean by ""planned obsolescence""? This part reads like you had a list of adjectives you wanted to use, and by god you used them.


Transition to the next idea, where you decry a conservative think-tank for criticizing China while also espousing a list of loosely related ideas.

Then you say, ""Price costs more than money."" What the fuck does that mean? I have absolutely no idea what you are trying to get across with that. I think, but this is pure guesswork, that you are trying to say, ""goods in a capitalist system are always undervalued."" But, nothing that you have posted really supports that. Perhaps you could make the case that negative externalities are inherently present in the production of all goods, but in all cases either the regulating authority responsible for taxing the production of goods to account for the cost of the negative externality does not have the power to do so, or does not have perfect information, therefore all goods are undervalued.  
But I just put a *lot* of words in your mouth to make a point that I don't even know if you were trying to make.

Then you conclude by saying that cheap consumer goods have, or will, result in Chinese hegemony. 

Now, just to recap, you started your post by saying that China needed more farmland to feed a growing population, transitioned into something vaguely related to the moralism of corporations, and ended by saying that cheap consumer goods have, or will, result in Chinese hegemony.

Perhaps you can see how that comes across as disjointed rambling?","1264983390"

However it's a little tricky when it comes to taxes... Idealistically everyone would contribute the same percentage (flat tax), however that is not likely going to be the case and you will end up with some people unable to support the system. In order to prevent someone who is attempting to contribute from being dropped for financial concerns you would have to tax those who have an excess a little more. 

I choose a little unfairness in the taxes over people loosing access to social programs. This could be used as an argument for disbanding any kind of social programs, but I feel that this would be even more immoral - especially if it directly impacts the lives of thousands of struggling people (such as the loss of food stamps or in countries that have it - universal healthcare).

"webdesign","t5_2qi2w","Start again...

Your front page is 1.3mb, mainly because you've done the backgound as a png, and in one go.

Firstly you need to get firefox, then install firebug and YSlow.  Then go through your current design and have a look at how you've laid out the divs.

Currently you've got most of the page in a flat structure within the bg div, and then the contact stuff at the bottom.

I'd split it into three divs - header, middle and contact.  The middle div can be split into two vertical columns, left and center.  Then you can put three divs into the center column - title, slider and content.

This will make the layout a lot more logical, and easy to control.  It also makes adding more stuff easier.  This is another problem with having a massive set background image!

To solve the background image size you need to slice it up into far more pieces, and try and use repeat as much as possible to handle the gradients (take a 1px slice of the image and repeat it).  Also, there are a few bits of text that you can justify having as image (Sweetness, Designed and the Gorgeous online presence) but the rest need to be in raw text as they're adding far too much to the image size, and they're not readable by search engines.  For example the main text in the header should just be a paragraph in a div.  Use a 1px semi transparent backgound .png and repeat it to get the dark see through shading, and just a normal colour border.  If thats too much of a compromise, put the dark div inside another div which is 1px bigger in each direction, and give the larger div a semi transparent background made out of a 1px high horizontal slice with the colour gradient you want on it, then repeat that vertically.

You can use this technique on other elements on the page (eg the rounded boxes) to make them a lot neater and smaller.

I think TTR, TaT and TA are definitely different enough to be worth trying (and perhaps ordering). TaT is somewhat similar to TTR, but far from the same game. TA is completely different. That's why I own all three (well technically I own [TransEuropa](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16267/transeuropa) and [Ticket to Ride Europe](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14996/ticket-to-ride-europe) but they're very similar to their American counterparts). Are you from the US ? [Thoughthammer](http://www.thoughthammer.com/) should have the lowest US prices hands down, if there's anything you're looking to buy.

For light and fun I forgot to mention [Niagara](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13308/niagara). Nice production value, uses the box as part of the game board setup. Check out some BGG pics to see what I mean: [1](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/119037/niagara), [2](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/60326/niagara), [3](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/60325/niagara).

PitchCar is expensive, large, heavy and a ton of fun. This may work for beer and pizza night ... but be wary of the amount of alcohol consumed. You're flicking wooden disks around. Size is definitely an issue. Also, with the components of the base game you can't really make cool/complicated tracks, so you need at least some the expansions ([1](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1526/pitchcar-extension) [2](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25946/pitchcar-extension-2) [3](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38677/pitchcar-stunt-race) [4](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25948/pitchcar-special-long-straights)). There is a smaller version called [PitchCar Mini](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14254/pitchcar-mini) but I wouldn't recommend it. The discs are much smaller, they don't have the same feel, it gets too crowded with 3+ players, etc.
Wasabi! has a high production value. It actually comes with real small soy sauce containers, and looks very nice. I find it to be an average game though, so I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.

If you look at it from an RTS perspective, I don't know how much you'd enjoy Manoeuvre or Corps Command (or any other wargame for that matter). They definitely resemble the TBS genre a lot more. I can't think of a fully real-time boardgame, but I know a couple exist with real time elements.

You're asking me for a strategy game, but I don't know if you mean strictly wargame, or abstract strategy as well (Go, Blokus, [Ingenious](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9674/ingenious), [Dvonn](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2346/dvonn), [Yinsh](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7854/yinsh), [Zertz](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/528/zertz), [Hive](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive)).

For abstract strategy, I find both Hive and Ingenious to be great. Hive is 2p only, Ingenious is 2-4. Ingenious also takes 2v2 (teams), which is quite a bit of fun as well.

For wargames, I'm currently very much into [CC:E](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21050/combat-commander-europe) - a card-driven hex-and-counter wargame. It has a sort of real time element that you may like - when the opponent moves using a particular type of card (2 types of cards allow movement, and you can only react to one of them), you may shoot at him. That's as far as it goes for both players doing something at the same time. Be wary though, the rulebook is long. You will fumble through it for your first few plays. Without prior wargame experience you may find it daunting.

Another one would be [CoH](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24800/conflict-of-heroes-awakening-the-bear-russia-194). I haven't actually played this one, but I know it has a similar real time element. Both players have 7 or 8 special action points, which may be used during the opponent's turn to interrupt it and do something. I think that something is limited to shooting, and once the points are gone they don't replenish.

What would a serious gamer play ... I'm not sure. The group I meet up with plays almost anything (some exceptions: SoC, Monopoly, Risk, Munchkin and anything else Steve Jackson, to name just a few). A lot of the [top ranked games on BGG](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) get tabled. There's also a guy who buys almost every new game that looks interesting - they usually get tabled for a few weeks from release then put in the ""trade"" pile.

As for myself, my preferences always tends to change. Currently, I'd always play [Agricola](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola), [Goa](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9216/goa) or the above mentioned CC:E. Yes, the theme of Agricola is farming, but that doesn't bother me one bit. Agricola has been at the top of my list for a while, CC:E and Goa joined somewhat recently. On a side note, I'm currently a lot more focused on CCGs than boardgames. Magic is eating up a lot of my time, even though I'm playing strictly casual.

You should also be conscious of nearly-identical photos. For example, in the scenic gallery, there are four pictures of what appears to be a pile of dirt, and they're very nearly the same photo. One photo gets the point across; choose the best one of each subject, unless two or three are REALLY blowing you away and you just can't decide.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A food source, reproduction and avoiding predation are needed for evolution to occur. The most important aspects are variation and reproduction.

It is also important to note that individuals do not evolve, populations do. Individual evolution is a Lamarckian theory (look up Lamarck), which basically states that a giraffes neck grew long so that it can reach the higher branches. This is false.

Darwin never said 'Survival of the Fittest'. Again, this is Lamarckian thinking, but the term was actually quoted by somene else (I forget who).

Evolution is not progressive- meaning that animals do not become faster, stronger or smarter. Evolution has no distinct direction.

The most interesting aspect of Evolution (to me) is the fact that cloning is possibly the WORST thing that can be done. There is no 'best' attributes when it comes to evolution. If everyone had the same genes, a single virus that had evolved could wipe out the entire population. It is our diversity that allows us to survive as a population.","1264983515"

If a bank were to, for years, practice fraud to cheat customers without their awareness, you wouldn't call it an ""incident"".

I think that currency controls are a method to maintain controls and to subvert technological progress....to lock in ownership where it could not be maintained in capitalism...to ensure the status quo.  I believe that this intervention, the declaration and control of a medium of exchange, allows for public ownership of wealth.   The public ownership of wealth allows it to be directed at powerful interests to the disadvantage of the lesser powers. A mixed economy affords this, not capitalism.

But from what I read [here](http://www.neuroskills.com/tbi/bparieta.shtml), it sounds like the left parietal lobe, or am I misinterpreting it (forgetting a little known rule or something)?

&gt;Damage to the left parietal lobe can result in what is called ""Gerstmann's Syndrome."" It includes right-left confusion, difficulty with writing (agraphia) and difficulty with mathematics (acalculia). It can also produce disorders of language (aphasia) and the inability to perceive objects normally (agnosia).

&gt;Damage to the right parietal lobe can result in neglecting part of the body or space (contralateral neglect), which can impair many self-care skills such as dressing and washing. Right side damage can also cause difficulty in making things (constructional apraxia), denial of deficits (anosagnosia) and drawing ability.

&gt;Bi-lateral damage (large lesions to both sides) can cause ""Balint's Syndrome,"" a visual attention and motor syndrome. This is characterized by the inability to voluntarily control the gaze (ocular apraxia), inability to integrate components of a visual scene (simultanagnosia), and the inability to accurately reach for an object with visual guidance (optic ataxia) (Westmoreland et al., 1994).

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Free speech is the issue. That is, how free ought speech be? Your starting stance is that there ought be no limits.

&gt; If that means that ""I believe there ought to be limits to the form of free speech"" then that statement is entirely useless.

Well that statement you referenced seems useless because it is contorted. Rather ""I believe there ought to be limits to the form of speech""

&gt; would be patently absurd to think that the above example [death causing message carving] should be legally protected as free speech.

Indeed. It is patently absurd to assert there ought be no limits to the freedom to express.

Note, as well as legal limits to expression based on form there are also ethical limits to expression based on form.

Take a free performance of Shakespeare in the park. It is a public performance on public land and everyone is invited. Imagine Joe talks from the audience during the performance, at a level that competes with the actors. It doesn't matter what Joe is talking about, Joe is going to disturb other peoples ability to absorb the play. Although Joe (possibly) can't be arrested or legally compelled to silence Joe would be doing something unethical. Regardless of the legal situation other audience members would have an ethical basis from which to ask you to limit your expression, by asking you to shut up or piss off.

&gt; What we are talking about when discussing free speech is laws that affect everyone. 

I have already demonstrated, I hope, that there are ethical, in addition to legal, considerations of the extent to which speech ought be free.  

However I agree that we (you, I and society) ought be clear on what legal limits there ought be, and ought not be.

Incidentally, where you are from do you sign contracts with your doctor? In the three countries I have visited doctors I have never signed a contract. I am not a lawyer. However my understanding is that in most jurisdictions doctor and patient relationships are not managed through contracts. Rather there is a licensing body which certifies the competency of a doctor. A doctor claiming certification will be taken to be claiming a level of competency to the community at large. All that takes care of the kind of function you are getting at, it seems, when you talk of a standardised contract. 

Anyhow, under either model (existing or hypothetical) If a doctor sees you and misdiagnoses you (and it is serious) you could sue the doctor and/or bring criminal charges. This would be legal recourse available to everyone. Something that affects everyone in the circumstance of being a patient or a doctor.

You seem, though, to want to mean by ""laws that affect everyone"" something like laws that apply to all people in all circumstances. I believe there should be some legal freedoms that apply to all people in all circumstances. For example, causing offense ought never be a legal (at least) basis for limiting speech, for all people, in all circumstaces. That is not to say that an expression that causes offense ought be legally permissible (cause the expression might also have some other feature which ought be legally restricted, like being broadcast over a meagaphone, in the dead of night, in the middle of the suburbs).

So you can point to such legal freedoms (that apply to all people in all circumstances). However the doctor example shows the legal freedom to say whatever you like is not, and ought not be, extended to all people in all circumstances.","1264983650"

So you're saying the Chinese want to able to be aggressive without any consequences or having anyone able to reign them in.  

&gt;So China has historic backing for its concern about oil supply.

So the US has historic backing to support it's concern that China intends to be aggressive toward others and fears the consequences if others can punish them by withholding oil. This argument can be seen from either side. ","1264983676"

"pornfree","t5_2rglh","I like to think about what men did in the days when there was no easy access to porn. What did they do? There were always the extreme vices, strip joints and brothels, but I doubt the majority of men went anywhere near all of that. I think masturbation has always been a way of blowing off the steam, and it itself isn't a bad thing. All things in moderation is key, I think. The goal should be to not reach for it at every little inclination, but at the same time not letting it go to the point where you feel yourself going insane. There's a happy median of having enough of that energy around, but not so much that you're bursting.

If it comes to the point where you can't get off without looking at smut, that's the red flag saying maybe you should just not do it for a while. It's always a better feeling, at least for me, to masturbate out of my real life frustrations. Adding porn to it is like mixing in some kind of toxic crap that sticks to my soul and mind.

I've identified one very damaging thought pattern in myself relating to porn. The act of surfing through image after image and video after video until you find one that really gets your dick hard. In the early years of porn it takes next to nothing. The first image immediately gets you going, but over time the habit gets you to where the search might take hours. I think everyone here knows the feeling of kicking yourself after wasting 3 hours for a mediocre orgasm.

This thought pattern translates into life in a potentially dangerous way, at least for me. We begin seeing the women around us the way we see the images we dig through. Quite often, we'll run into a girl who, if it were the internet, we'd be quickly digging for her nudie pics. It creates a twisted sort of desire, which, when coupled with the innate loneliness a lot of single men feel, creates a painful sense of being torn by the lustful desire and that desperation of the heart that wants to be accepted, and it all culminates in this awful sense of low self worth and unfulfilled animalistic lust. 

I know that in myself, it results in a tremendous amount of anger and frustration.

I can feel the relief even after however many days it's been (I haven't been counting) since I subjected myself to it. ","1264983686"

"programming","t5_2fwo","So what?

Let's say we write competing products for platform X.  You write your code in carefully and meticulously optimized assembly.  I write mine in Python.

We both start at the same time.  A week later, my product is finished.  Admittedly, it's pretty slow.  I show it to my manager.   He's impressed with my results, but he is concerned that customers will want something that runs a little faster.  I promise to work on optimizing the code.  You have some of your core functionality written.

In the next week, I profile my product and optimize the bottlenecks in C.  My product is now in the hands of QA, who kick back a slew of bug reports, to which I respond with bugfixes.  You are almost done with your core functionality, but you haven't started working on the UI.

In week three, marketing comes up with a campaign to advertise my product.  I'm tacking on some features when my buddy two cubicles over suggests that I port it to platform Q.  I drop it onto a test box, and most of it runs without modification, since Python + C is pretty portable.  You finally start working on the UI.

In week four, I release.  Bug reports come in from users rapidly and I release my first product update within hours of the initial release.  The bug report rate begins to die down, and I release a second product update just before leaving a half-hour early on Friday to pick up chicks at karaoke.

Your boss sees my product and gives you a visit to see what's taking you so long.  You promise to come in on Saturday to finish up the UI.  You finally finish at 7PM on Sunday and after sending an email to QA, you collapse next to your wife who rolls over and asks you why you're never there for her.

In week five, I fix a few bugs and start working on a new product.  You receive a huge pile of bug reports from QA, most caused by rushing to produce your product on too little sleep.  At the end of the week, QA is still finding bugs, but your manager is afraid that as more time goes by, you'll lose even more customers to my product.  You disagree, but it isn't your decision to make.  The product is released, and as you predicted to your boss, it is hailed as a buggy piece of crap.  Still it manages to get .5% of the market since some people like the ""minimalist UI"" which results from your lack of features.

In week six, you fix most of the bugs in your product and release an update.  I release a second product for platform X in addition to another product update for my first product.

Over the next six months, your market share grows as a few people notice that, while your product is just catching up to mine in features, yours is slightly faster.  However, my product also takes off on platform Q.  Platform X is losing popularity.

After six months, the manufacturer of platform X releases a statement saying that they will no longer support platform X and will be moving to a platform Q compatible architecture.  Your boss comes to you to ask if you can port your product, and you tell him that it will require a complete rewrite.  After looking over the data and talking to one of your coworkers, your boss realizes that this is *all your fault*, and fires you.  When you tell your wife, she doesn't buy your talk of having more time to spend with her, and begins filing for divorce.  My boss sees the report from the manufacturer and smiles: my product already runs on platform Q.

Now, at this point, the zen master asks, whose code runs faster?  The answer is simple: neither.  My code cannot run faster than your code, because your code doesn't run at all.","1264983694"

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","The people who are most memorable for me, probably wouldn't be the people you notice. The people I remember are the ones that break the spanging (or panhandling) rules. There are only 3 rules, so it shouldn't be that hard:

1. Don't ask people for change if they are homeless, or used to be. It's a sign of disrespect.
2. Don't ask people with kids for money, or pregnant women. I think the thought behind this rule is that they should be spending their money on their kids.
3. Don't ask disabled people for change. Duh.

So when someone I knew when I was homeless asks me, I get pissed the fuck off. We get into it sometimes, it's just disrespectful.. sometimes they'll call me names like oogle cause I got off the streets. That's about the worst thing you can call another homeless kid.

I sorta answer the westlake question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/aweof/i_was_a_street_kid_in_seattle_in_2000_ask_me/c0jqy6b) but really I just can't stand those kids. Most of them are old foster kids.. they are just too young and stupid to blend in on the hill. A lot of the juggalos hang out there too. Some of these kids just come from the drop in centers down there like Orion Center, which closes at 7pm and they just have nothing else to do before they go sleep outside or go home. The shelters are all closing by 8pm, so those aren't shelter kids at night.

I used to work at Orion Center actually when I was 16-17.. and a lot of those kids decided they were in a gang called the OC gang, and they had a rivalry with another drop in center that was open later. They always did stupid shit like this, I don't understand it.

Doing it with your fingers, or with a vibrator is personal preference, and also because you know what feels good. Someone else eating you out, or rubbing your clit for you doesn't know where it feels good, and it can be awkward and frustrating. 

It took my boyfriend 4 months of practise, and I mean a LOT of practise, to figure out how to lick just right.

""Self"" and ""mind"" and  are abstract abstract concepts which are almost by definition subjective.

What about the mind of those person who grow up in the wild with no language and with no human interaction? What about the mind of a psychopath?

You were the woman who rear ended my car on Patton Ave at 2am last night. You were in a red Camry and I was in the blue Neon. You said you didn't have insurance and ""really couldn't afford this right now"". We pulled our cars into the empty K-Mart parking lot and began to discuss the best way to handle this situation. While we were talking I couldn't help but notice your low cut shirt and you caught me looking, gave me a smile, and we both agreed to settle this matter ""like adults"". That was truly one of the best blowjobs I've ever had. I wish I knew your name!

Portland has a huge blues dancing and tango dancing scene. Great for first dates- not so good if you've been dating a while. You probably wanna search around and find a place you are the most comfortable at.

 http://www.groundkontrol.com/

I don't like it, but if you are on the nerdier side of things its a bar with video games. Only real thing to do with a girl is drunk dance dance, but the machine seems broken 50% of the time.

Tarot reading goes for an interesting evening. Its more something thats an addition to the date. There are a handful of different future readers in portland. Be ready to be underwhelmed- but its still interesting.

I was stupid and answered one question wrong: 'Can we keep the abandoned keep we just cleared the orcs out of?' A simple small-sized castle I did on graph paper. I planned it to be a couple night thing. yeah. I let 'em keep it, and this is what I discovered:

You lose a lot of motivation for your characters, as they don't need money (the property usually produces it), and they now have a place to store all their trinkets, so they end up usually having a massive stockpile of magical weapons, etc. 

Mages have a place to store and use resources to research spells.
Warriors can raise an army, your clerics can start a temple, woodsy types get antsy about all the civilization going on, dwarves start digging mines or never come out of the forge, people just get settled. 

Then there's the management. Someone's got to do the bookkeeping, and the characters, who are already usually the richest people for miles, become the biggest employer in the region. Also there's the logical political and social consequences of a new economic/magical power in the region, if you want to get into that. I did. It was actually fun for a while, but it got mindboggling. They wanted to raise an army, started getting ideas about taking over surrounding territory, all that jazz. It was beginning to be hard to justify why I kept saying no, and saying yes would mean running my players' effect on the economy society and history of an entire region of my game world.

It can lead to a lot of awesome roleplaying, but I'm not sure it's still D&amp;D when you're negotiating property rights with the local liege, deciding henchman's wages, what to do with the portal to the negative material plane your mage opened in her lab, mustering up a militia to go fight off the local orc infestation once and for all, and how to keep the cleric from raising 30 dead villagers a month and becoming a messiah.

The good news is, you can then burn it all down or destroy it, and they will rage for campaign after campaign for revenge and to get a shadow of it back. That's exactly what I did. I popped some Illithids under their little castle home, destroyed or stole most of their stuff while they were out, and let them know exactly who did it and where in the underdark they could be found.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","You honestly think they improved the inventory aspect in ME2? Maybe the console version was horrible but the pc inventory worked, maybe not as well as it could (as in auto arrange inventory to have better up top).

The change from having ammo mods as items to having ammo mods as powers really made the soldier class the worst in ME2 as it just feels a lot more passive to all the other classes. Also feels completely pointless as you can just bump up your favourite sidekick to have an ammo mod that works for the whole team.

On the issue of menus in particular (something complained about in the Zero Punctuation review of ME1) removing hotkeys for all the parts of the menu you want to get to instantly from the PC version constantly annoyed me throughout the entire game. I liked being able to go ""oh, my journal is updated"" press j; in ME2 it is ESC, select journal and takes twice the time to get back into the game as it did in ME1.

The mako sections got replaced by the vastly more tedious scanning planets for minerals that is 100% required to do until your eyes bleed in order to get the good ending so not really fixed there (again, the controls for the mako on the PC weren't bad just the terrain tended to have too many sharp spikes).

If you watch the Zero Punctuation review of ME1 you will notice that he says basically if you like Bioware RPGs you will like it and that is why he doesn't.

Although superior to drinking a bunch of soda, the harm of running on fructose is significant.  It causes insulin insensitivity and is absorbed so quickly, your blood sugar levels will be spiking and dropping all day.

A better plan would involve cutting out fried food, white bread and processed snacks.  Stick to meat, eggs, whole grains and lots of veggies/fruits and dairy, and get in that exercise!

Drink water instead of juice/soda, and don't try and strip down your meals to have no caloric content. Food is your friend here, not your enemy.  Butter, in reasonable quantities early in the day, can be your best friend. Rushing weight loss is a plan for failure.

I don't think you comprehend how search works.  Right now the search just searches words in the title.  So when people use clever funny titles that don't use specific words that the link would be described as, that can never be found again.

The only way to fix that is to let people tag stuff with keywords.  This is what many sites use.  Because it is the only way to do it.  Why try to parse out what you the link points to(would not work on pictures) or why try to search every word in every post in a thread?  Let the user put in keywords when they make the link. That way the post can be easily found and you don't have to reinvent google.

&gt;if google already does a better job at searching than reddit then the search box on reddit should be replaced by the google custom site search feature.

There is no point in having a reddit search that does what google does.  Because anyone can use google now.  So if that is what you want, you clearly don't have a gripe.  Put ""site:reddit.com"" at the end of your google searches and you are done.  Congrats you are now happy.

But people don't want to search a word and get every place in comments where that word was said.  They search something and they want links that apply to that word.

In addition they need to let people freely select a time frame. Many times people remember this happened last november, but you can't search last november.  You can only search for the last year.  That time frame is way too big.  People shouldn't have to include all of the most recent stuff in their searches.  They should be able to select and start and end date/time when searching.

"science","t5_mouw","I've had enough of the government deferring its responsibilities to private contractors. Here in Pennsylvania, our Governor tried to lease our state-run turnpike to a private concern, telling us it would lead to a cost savings. Maybe that's true, but it leads me to ask why we bother having any government programs at all if they can be better run by businessmen. The US DoD and DoS have hired Xe (nee Blackwater) to provide mercenaries overseas; I must then ask why we are spending money on our own army and its infrastructure.

There is a select core of governmental responsibilities of which few (except Libertarian loons) question the legitimacy. Among them are defense and transportation infrastructure. NASA is in one of those gray areas that could go either way; and so perhaps we need to make a decision ... either they are a governmental function or space exploration is a commercial concern, but not both.

If Obama wants to encourage private companies to build, launch, and operate spacecraft then fine -- disassemble NASA.

I say this as a strong NASA proponent (though their monumental failures during the Space Shuttle program have shaken my faith). I think US sponsored space exploration is incredibly important to the US and to mankind as a whole, but I don't think a partnership with commercial enterprises will lead to any broad-based public benefit. If that's the only option, I'd just as soon the gov't divest its interest in space exploration.","1264984124"

"science","t5_mouw","If it's not the friction, then the answer lies in another part of your question:

""It *felt* much, much lighter this way.""

Were you pulling both sleds with the same hand, or did you use two hands (one for each sled)?  If so, then the force required to pull is distributed across your body, likely causing the sensation of higher exertion when each kid was on a different sled, versus when both were on one: that would focus the required force into a singular point across your body and make it easier for you to leverage your weight to help you pull.

However, if you pulled *both* times with the same hand/shoulder/whatever, it may be an issue of momentum, since each sled (with a kid on it) would have independent momentum and the perceived additional force would be in keeping them aligned on a common trajectory (versus having both kids on the same sled, since the momentum from the empty sled is relatively negligible).  

Like trying to keep two shopping carts with wonky wheels on the same path: if both are half full, the wonkiness will cause increased exertion, versus having one completely full and one empty (since the wonkiness of the second one will be negligible).","1264984142"

That technique of teaching really helped me to not get caught up in the numbers, but instead understand the reasoning behind the individual formulas.

I've read through that thread; but I'd really like it if you could point me to some of those posts. Thanks.

&gt; I would genuinely like to call myself a libertarian, but this obsession with taxation at the expense of other more serious threats to liberty is what prevents me doing so.

Well, then you just have a difference of opinion over what is a bigger threat to liberty. The idea is that taxes are one of the largest sources of government revenue, and therefore, if you cut that down (or off completely), then the government is forced to shrink in size. Therefore, other threats that the government causes are also reduced.

(However, I would tend to believe that abolishing the Fed is a stronger budget constraint than lowering taxes.)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh my.  Circa 1974, I came into possession of my first car, a 1964 Rambler wagon.  The car was purchased, in San Diego, by two brothers.  They drove it to Pennsylvania and turned it over to me for very small consideration. 

The starter went out early in the trip to Pennsylvania so they just never shut it off.  By the time it got to PA, the engine was more or less used up.  That 196 c.i.d. had pretty much given up the ghost.  The engine mounts were shot. The throtte linkage was fekked up so the gas pedal was essentially a binary operation - all or nothing.   At a stop sign, I'd mash the pedal (it even _felt_ more like pushing a button than operating a variable pedal) and all hat would happen is the engine would start to make horrible noises.  It would rock back and forth in its extremely loose mounts, making a thud!Bang!THUD! noise so that anyone nearby had to turn and stare.  After a bit, the car would inch forward and gradually pick up steam until topping out at about 50 mph.  

My friends and I would go to East Branch Dam, drink some beer, swim, etc.  There was a fairly steep hill between there and home.  Everyone but me had to get out and walk up.  

It had a great heater. 

One day I was driving down the Johnsonburg Road when the single bolt holding the rear body to the rear frame fell off.  At that point the body was just sitting on coil springs, not really connected to the frame in any meaningful way.  Driving the rather curvy road led to the wheels taking one track and the body an entirely divergent path.   

The heater was very good. 

I took the _Rambler_ name off, cut into component letters and rapplied them christening the car _mabel_. 

It had a really good heater.  That _Weathereye_ heater kept me warm even in the north central PA winter.

Mad **cow** disease (Bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is transmittable to humans and causes Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, but I don't see McDonalds shutting down anytime soon. CWD and mad-cow disease are both transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), and their occurence is extremely rare in humans. All TSE's combined affect less than 1 person per million every year, compare that to cardiac arrests, and it's an absolute joke.

3. Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of Vitamin C in the body, usually from lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Goat meat has nothing to do with it.

4. Cannibalism is not a socially acceptable norm, harvesting geese is acceptable and highly recommended.

Cows (/pigs/chickens) are packed by the thousands into farms at arms reach, eating and shitting in their own feces. That is far less sanitary than the environment wild deer live in, and yet; beef, pork, and chicken are consumed without any concern whatsoever, while venison is seen is unsafe.

OLEAUT32.dll is a VB module for Object Linking and Embedding (Using word as the email editor for outlook etc.), I'm not sure what Bioshock would be using that for.

You could try checking your systems specs at [Can you run it?](http://cyri.systemrequirementslab.com/srtest/). It's pretty good way to see if you'll be able to play something - although one caveat is that sometimes it will give a false negative because you have a dual core with a lower speed than a single core processor

Have you tried all the usual things? Flagging the bioshock exe to run as administrator? Running the exe from explorer, rather than from the steam client. 

If all else fails and you have the time/inclination/resources to do it... Try dual booting into XP and seeing if it runs there. Thats what I have to do if I want to play Mirrors Edge (it sucks as a solution, but it does work).

[Pediatrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics_%28journal%29), which is
an official peer-reviewed journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.  Its
conclusion (see notes below):

&gt; Allocation of CDRTxs between young Jewish and Arab ESRF patients on dialysis did not differ and was associated with comparable waiting times, identical RTx scores, and similar long-term outcome. This is a remarkable finding, certainly in the face of the unequal race allocation of RTxs in the United States as well as the long unstable local (Middle East) political situation. 

Notes: CDRTx = cadaver-donor renal transplantation; ESRF = end-stage renal failure;
RTx = renal transplant.

Keep a balanced diet of mixed proteins, carbs and fats. Do not fall into the aftertaste of the ""no fat ninetee's"". The right fats are very good for you and your body needs them for energy. These fats include those found in olive oil, yoghurt, avacado and almonds.

Plus, start keeping excercise habits. A great program to get you started is the [ Couch to 5k ]( http://www.c25k.com/ ) program. It gives you very gradual, regular podcasts that assist you with your goal of eventually running 5km. It's worked for a lot of people and is a great introduction to excercise.

Finally, keep a food and excercise diary. Nothing smacks you in the face harder than seeing your own bad eating habits physically written down in front of you.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Yes, but when you contributed your tax money to such a cause, creating a sense of volatility in a city which really is a safe place for people to come live and or invest in, goes no where. Like smpx, said, it only ruins our chances of recovering from this.

Whatever side of the fence you are on, we are at a point when, any amount of ""protest"" isn't really going to get you anywhere. No official is going to see your sign, get moved by it and say ""OMG, STOP THE OLYMPICS"". The more likely scenario is, they enjoy Vancouver, think that it's an awesome place and then have their stay ruined by protesters who  by the way only seemed to have started opposing the Olympics in it's final stages.

I understand that you are upset with the fact that you think that a lot of what was done in Vancouver is bad, but it isn't. The city got a much needed face lift and believe it or not, even though we are the host country and city, the amount we put towards upgrades and in general preparing for the games is nothing when compared to how much money sponsors have put in. 

So one way of viewing it is that, money that we always had a hard time, getting from the Canadian government for improving BC has been a lot easier. Not to mention that corporations have paid for something, that all citizens will enjoy long after the Olympics are gone.

People seem to easily forget that there was just as much opposition from Expo '86 but it put us on the world stage and also was the reason that our beloved Skytrain was built. Thanks to the Olympics it is a lot easier to get around now and will be for coming years.

At this stage, I personally view this as an opportunity to showcase Vancouver's unique and frankly awesome culture and lifestyle. You and I have paid for a party and it's too late to sulk in a corner, so let's just enjoy it. We can point fingers all we want after this is all over.

On a side note, I think that a lot of misinformation has been flying around about how much money we are losing/lost and what are all the negative aspects of us hosting the Olympics. I suggest you do some of your own research on the matter as most of the stuff you hear in the news is heavily biased and blown out of proportion.","1264984372"

i had gone in meaning to buy final fantasy tactics, and it just happened to be on sale. strangely, on its own it cost £25. at first i thought maybe someone had put it on the sale shelf by accident, so i asked one of the employees, and he confirmed that it was in fact part of the 2 for £20 sale. so i picked up Daxter (£15 on its own). basically, i got £5 off final fantasy and a free game to boot.","1264984387"

No, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAHAHA NO THEY ARE NOT, and eh, a few strategies carry over, but otherwise no.

The guns are completely different from 1.6 in every single way. Damage, spray, recoil, and accuracy off the first shot. The game play is completely changed due to the weapon. You can dominate with a p90 due to it throwing off the person's aim more than is shown. If I get an awper in the small toe with a p90 bullet they're dead as I will easily mow them up with no fear of them being able to shoot me outside of blind luck.

Seeing how that's just a single example, and in 1.6 the P90 was worthless... yeah, completely different games.

Want another one? The AK47 was a laser pointer on the first bullet out of the magazine. Now in CSS the first bullet is also effected by random cone shaped bullet spread. That opening bullet was the success or failure of many top ranking players. 

I played since 1.3 competitively, I played in the CSS alphas and betas. I've got the spread of bullets for the M4 and Ak memorized in my head for 1.6.

Rice particularly is more important in southern cooking than northern.  I didn't say they didn't eat it anywhere else, but rice is only produced in seven states, 6 of them being Southern States, last being Cali.

Friday Night Lights was filmed in Houston :) Again, I'm sure it's big other places but the south tends to be a bit more vocal about it.

I don't know about many backwood cities in the north that steal peoples personal possessions in lieu of payment for non-existing tickets.  The south, I'd feel comfortable saying, has a history of corruption in law enforcement, particularly in small towns filled with good ol' boys.

The Beauty Pageant is largely a southern thing.  Particularly with young girls, and they start wearing make up extremely early.  

Knowing Spanish in the south is not a bad idea by any means.  Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, West Virginia, all of them have decent Hispanic populations and they are steadily growing.   A buddy of mine just moved to Atlanta and he is one of 3 people who knows English at his job.

Obviously there is no way that you could ingest a pill and time travel, but what if the right cocktail of drugs could be perscribed that would make you forget a period of time. An hour, a day, a week, a month, years... with continued perscription dosages, you would live your life, you'd have to do the shit things, but when it was all over, you would stop taking the drug and wouldn't remember a thing. It wouldn't be perfect of course, but there are al ot of things I would have liked to been dulled for. 

The logistics are pretty easy, at least as a thought experiment. Certain drugs can interfere with the ability to remember episodic events right? Alcohol and Marijuana being the most two prevelant. What if you could isolate that effect? Something like GHB without any kind of loss of inhibition, just the memory effect? Now, to make a pill that would cause you to remember day to day events, and to just cut out the chunk of memory while you're on the pill would be alot harder, but it isn't entirely insane.

The philosophical ramifications are actually alot harder to work out; *would* you do this? Under what circumstances should it even be considered, I mean, we only have one life, you really want to intentionally forget it?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It was my birthday, and I was going to participate in a software demo (techcrunch50 type) competition at a college across the city. I was getting there by public transport, and back in the day they didn't have doors on buses in my city.

So I'm wearing my best clothes and waiting for a bus, and none of them are stopping at my stop. So I decide, I'm going to run up and jump on to the next one. In my city this is a common thing to do for moderately slow-moving buses -- Only that this was not a moderately slow moving bus, I had made an error in judgement.

Since I was holding on to the front door handle of the bus, I get yanked by my wrists, while the bus is moving at about 20-30mph, and I'm now being dragged by the bus, my feet and knees scraping on the road. I look down, and I see the back tires of the bus spinning. If I let go, I'm going to be under them.

After about a minute of this, the bus operator notices, and gets the bus to stop. My brand new jeans are torn, my new shoes are scratched. I get on the bus and make it in time to the competition.

I'm still shaking from almost dying, but I make one of the best demo presentations I've ever made, and win first prize in the competition. Overall, best day ever.

tl;dr: Almost got run over by a bus, still won 1st place at competition. Best birthday ever.","1264984456"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, first of all, I was comparing digital to digital.  And my point was that a lot of people really don't have trouble with the newer formats.  A lot of times the attraction to the older formats is just a sentimental attachment or a tolerance you've built up to one format's weaknesses, so that you don't even see them anymore.

However, if you want to compare vinyl to digital, I agree the record sleeves are nice and big, but I never grew attached to the sound of vinyl, because frankly I don't *like* the sound of vinyl:

* It can't handle bass well, which is why the RIAA equalization curve is applied before mastering.
* The tonal character of the medium (frequency response, etc.) actually changes as you get toward the center of the disc, because the angular speed stays constant so the linear speed is reduced and because the angle between the groove and the tone arm changes.  I've actually found myself flipping the disc over before the last song because I don't want to suffer through the less flattering region of the disc.
* And actually, the angular speed doesn't always stay constant.  You can get a big heavy platter and fix variations in the platter speed by sheer inertia, but the hole in the record might be a little off-center or slightly too large.

Of course there are other problems like clicks and pops and how the needle destroys the finer features of the groove as you play, but I'm not going to make an exhaustive list.  If I were going to collect music in an analog format, it'd probably be reel-to-reel tape.  It has its own problems, but there are fewer problems than with vinyl, and you can actually get great frequency response and low noise if you run the tape fast.","1264984466"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","I commuted to work for years with three full-suspension bikes, two had disc brakes. Combined commuting mileage was around 10k, total mileage varied over the years, probably ~15k. I used either touring tires (think Schwalbe Marathon 1.75"") or (mostly) offroad tires (various, all around 2.1"").  
I think tire choice is crucial for having fun on the trails and not too much sorrow on the road. I'd stay clear from super-coarse tread patterns, therefore. But it is sometimes hard to judge, the old Ritchey Max tires I once used were easy rollers. But as Baddog said, tires aren't hugely expensive.   

There are a few reasons why I now commute with my old rigid bike, depsite missing the creature comfort of suspension: 
* theft - I no longer work at a place where I can lock the bike away
* full length mudguards - I know these are for wusses, but I am glad I got them now. They keep me clean and they keep my bike clean. With only detachable mudguards, my fully would stand at work for 10 hours, uncleaned after a wet ride to work. And when I'd hop on the bike to get back home, the chain was starting to rust. I then put an old lube bottle at work, but really, how many employers are going to be okay with that?  I also DIY-extended my detachable mudguards for better protection.  

Do not underestimate the importance of cleaning your bike, especially the damper and fork surfaces. It's not a huge business, but can save you money in the medium run. Also, I'd suggest you think about lighting and on-trail-repairs (in the dark?) now. But I assume you already did that, as you already commute by bike.  

I didn't mean to sound negative - I think you should get the bike (as you did), it will be surely great fun to try something new - just wanted to report my personal experience.  

Oh, before I forget. I had one complete frame fracture (I assume wrong maintenance by the store, but cannot be sure) and one where I noticed the crack before it was too late. I am a light and mild rider. If your bike starts to make creaky noises and the bolts/screws on your pedals, crank, seatpost, saddle are tight, then you should investigate all frame components closely, possibly after washing your bike and with someone helping you: Assistant ""pumps"" bike, you look for ""breathing"" cracks.  

TL,DR: Go for it!

Off the top of my head, water is the only one that has the line separating liquid and solid tilting to the left.  That means that it's the only thing that will liquify if adequate pressure is applied.  It's because ice is actually less dense than water.  When you add pressure, the crystal lattice structure of ice collapses, it becomes water.  The density thing is nifty, and it's why ice floats.  Since ice floats, life in water persists.

About conversation - two things.  


1- There's nothing wrong with gravitating toward people you have common interests with.  Your best friends and your best potential dating partners are going to be people you just click with naturally.


2- Listen.  Asking questions and getting the other person talking is just as good (maybe better) than knocking his/her socks off with your own insights.

A recall where people get their money back.  You can't fix a problem you cannot identify and the government isn't going to let them not recall the cars.

&gt;Enough with the conspiracy theories. Seriously, you sound like a 9/11 truther. If they weren't fixing the problem, they wouldn't claim to be fixing the problem. There's no money in it.

You are just a retard that has no idea what you are talking about. It is not a conspiracy theory that the software has a problem they cannot identify.  Again, people that had the problem have confirmed pulling the pedal forward did not fix the problem.  So it is not a stuck pedal. I find it almost hilarious that in those cases with the fatal accidents the people didn't try to pull the pedal up, or didn't notice the pedal being stuck all the way down.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","i actually almost married my ex so that he'd get better financial aid and had been with him for 2 years or so.  ultimately, his parents didn't want him to get married for that and agreed to help him more with school and we did not go through with it.  i was 19 at the time and thought we were going to be life partners. needless to say, we are not together anymore - just kind of grew apart and wanted different things after a while.  i don't know if that would have happened if we would have gotten married - maybe we'd be more committed to making it work, maybe we'd have the expense and pains of a divorce by now.  

i think there is nothing wrong with having partial financial reasons for marriage - hell, that is historically what marriages have been.  if you've got the love, too, then that's just gravy!  i don't know your situation, but you sound like you are maybe 21 or so? living together that long at least gives you a perspective of that. on the other hand, sometimes people don't fully realize what they want/need until they are a little older.   *shrug*  you know how you feel about each other.  good luck in whatever you decide.

whatever you decide, remember that your marital status at the time that you file for financial aid/fafsa sticks for that aid year. for instance, if you have already filed your fafsa for the 2010-2011 school and get married after that, your marital status will not take effect until the next aid year. if you've already filed for this year, it might behoove you to wait a bit before jumping into that decision since you will not benefit from it until next aid year.  you may already know this, but I thought I'd point it out anyways. I'm actually in the opposite situation - my partner and i are postponing marriage until he files for financial aid this year so my income does not hinder his aid.  we are both 28, so considered independent, but I make enough  (although i don't make all that much) that he would likely lose out on some aid/have a larger contribution level.

you might also want to consider that there is the new income-based payment plans for federal loans, so it might not be as dreadful to pay things back.

Being that there are only 3 toilets, a line had formed outside (as is inevitable if you're in there for more than a couple minutes). I nodded at the girl who was waiting, as if to say ""sorry for the wait, enjoy your stay!""

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Actually, the term you are looking for is ""Assault Weapon"" not ""Assault Rifle"".  The fact that politicians invented the term ""Assault Weapon"" to sound very close to ""Assault Rifle"" was not an accident.  It makes people who are uninformed think that when the media and politicians talk about the danger of ""Assault Weapons"" they are talking about full auto guns.

This is why you need to be sure people understand the difference, and they do not confuse ""Assault Weapons"" with ""Assault Rifles"".  It's not about being snarky; it's about making sure people don't fall into the confusion trap that the ""Assault Weapon"" term was invented to cause.

* greater durability

Usually when I'm travelling, I just bring one or maybe two books, and I don't want to worry about another expensive electronic device that might break, might get stolen, and needs charging.  So, even if I had an e-book reader, I don't think I'd bring it with me on trips unless they were extended or had lots of opportunity for down-time.  At this point, I just can't justify the capital cost of getting one, especially since I still have a big stack of books to read.

And I was never a 'master'-- just learned a handful of expert techniques, that served me well. Much of the rest of my expertise resided in my car. My dad and I almost accidentally hit the perfect sweet spot with that vehicle in many ways. And I never even realized how near perfect it was in things like handling until around 2004 when I began writing about it and doing related research on the web, which allowed me to do many comparisons and learn many things I never got the opportunity to do when I owned the vehicle. That's one reason I sometimes today fantasize about finding it again, parked in a field or barn somewhere, in exactly the same shape as last I saw it (even if that condition was pretty rough).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I live in Okinawa (an American not in the military) on a smaller island off of the main one, but I have spent time there and read quite a bit about the situation. 

It is a two edged sword, economic assistance through the influx of Americans has helped sustain the economy since the end of the war (starting with such things as the `comforting` of GIs) yet the cost at which this support comes is rather great. 
Noise pollution (planes and choppers flying around all day long; there was even an instance where a helicopter crashed into a school about 15 years ago), land occupation (much of the land where the bases are located was forcibly removed from farmers after the war and it took years for them to receive some, if any monetary reinmbursement), something like 90% of crime in Okinawa is committed by GIs (DUIs, fighting, rape - a big one there, every 5 years or so a high school or missle school girl is raped by GIs).

While pen_is_mightier is correct that `this isn`t really anything new` this instance is quite different. Where the base is going to be moved is a BIG decision that will affect not only the residents of Okinawa but can make quite an impact of US-Japan relations. 

What is happening right now is different, many Okinawans (not all, as j1337 points out, though I think he has oversimplied the situation) have been very adamant that they don`t want the base on their land and have been for a while - they are finally getting heard. Or at least it seems the mainland is listening, whether they actually take it into consideration reamins to be seen.

There has been a lot of discussion from officials and in the media about where they may move the base were it to be placed outside of Okinawa. One of these proposed locations is the island that I live on, a notion that is downright terrifying when thinking about what it would do to the community here. I have no idea what the final result will be, but I can imagine it is only going to get stickier...","1264984796"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As a teenager, I once helped to save a friends life.  We were all headed to a party in three separate cars.  He was in the front driving a pickup truck and took a corner too fast.  He lost control and crashed into the embankment of a ditch which crushed the front of his truck and bounced it almost straight up into the air.  There were was one passenger who had only minor injuries, but my friend who was driving was unconscious.  I pulled him from the truck; he regained consciousness but was in shock and bleeding from multiple wounds, including a gash on his head.  We told him to lay still while me and another friend went to find a phone to call for help (this was the early 80's and few people had cell phones).  There were only a few houses where we were and nobody was home at any of them.  So I went back to the wreck site to suggest we take him to the hospital ourselves and found that everyone had left.  I figured they had taken him to the hospital so we headed over there.  At the hospital, he wasn't there and the ER hadn't heard anything about a wreck.  So I decided to go to his house next.  When we arrived at his house, all the lights were out so I figured they must not have come here.  So we sat there for a few minutes trying to figure out what to do.  I decided I had better let his mom know that he's been in an accident, and we should use her phone to call police etc.  While walking up the driveway I noticed a trail of blood leading to the house, right up to the front door.  I realized he must have been here and I knocked on the door.  His older brother opened the door, irritated that someone was knocking so late.  I realized he didn't know what was going on so I explained about the wreck, by this time their mother had gotten up and wanted to know what was going on, I told her about the wreck.  At first they didn't believe me because they heard him come in and they knew he was in his bed.  I pointed to the blood drops on the floor and his mom started to panic.  She started yelling, got him up from his room, asked him where the truck was and if he wrecked it.  Amazingly, he denied wrecking the truck and seemed to still be in shock.  His mom started yelling at him even more... I had to shout to get her attention and pleaded with her to call him an ambulance and that she could ground him later.  She seemed to snap out of her anger and agreed.  I hung around till the ambulance crew got there.  They patched him up and took him to the hospital where the gash in his head got stitched up.  After the medics found out what happened and why he was home in bed with a gash from a traffic accident in his head, they asked who got everyone up.  I said that I did; he said that I probably saved my friends life because if he'd been left in his bed overnight he could have died or gone into a coma and that the people who brought him home were idiots.   


I found out later that the rest of our friends brought him home because that's what he wanted.  They said he got combative about it so they gave in; drove him home, let him out and he went inside.","1264984815"

Metamucil is insoluble fiber. 
Oatmeal is (mostly) soluble fiber.

Soluble fiber slows digestion in most people.
Insoluble fiber speeds digestion in most people (and functions as a gentle laxative).

Steel cut oats have a much higher fiber content than pressed or instant oats. The pressing (or pressing and parboiling of instant oats) removes significant amounts of the fiber.

But one day my bf and I were just really really into eachother. I was giving head and he kinda just spun me around and started returning the favor. I discovered that it felt very intimate, that we were very much connected and it wasn't ""dirty"" at all. It might just be that she doesn't actually LIKE performing oral. SOme girls don't. Some girls love it. And you should be able to tell if she's really enjoying pleasuring you in that way, or if she's just kinda feeling obligated.

Do you guys skype sex? If you don't get to see eachother often, skype can be really damn fun. Or sexting. 

On the whole, it seems like oyu odn't have a very good dialogue about your sex life becuase you don't get to be together as often as you want. When you ARE together, sex is the first thing on your mind. In a ""git it done"" sort of way. Slow down, and talk about it a LOT more.

[601,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties)

[94,000-104,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Body_Count_project)


The estimates are that we killed between 1 and 4** fucking percent** of the iraqi population. On September 11th, **0.00098%** of our population died. If you add in our deaths caused by an unnecessary war we started, the number rises to **0.0028%** of our population dead.

The entire thing is disgusting. But do you want to know the most terrible part? That number you said we need to kill, **849,000**, *easily* falls within our lowest and highest estimates of dead.

We have killed hundreds of thousands (possibly millions) of people to the cost of less than 9,000 of our own, and they *don't even matter enough to count*.

And you are right, the mako is flawed by design, I was hoping they would change that design, not just remove it completely. You can't really say that the new system of scanning planets is any better. It consists of:

* Hold right click
* Move mouse until you get a hit
* Left click

And repeat forever.

A few new enemies with interesting attack patterns would have changed the mako combat strategy (ie: flying enemies, heat seeking weapons, suicide drones, etc.) the replacement simply feels like busywork.

I think the most frustrating portion of the mako however was the terrain on the randomly generated planets. It consisted of such an impassable heightmap that was clearly generated by clamped noise that no matter what you did you ended up rocking back and forth like a baby in a homicidal swing-chair.

(Not to spoil anyone's viewing experience or anything, but the ending is not the kind where the good guy wins after shooting all the evildoers.) My next thought was, ""how far are they going to dumb it down so an average American audience can relate? Hell, for that matter, how are they going to import that convoluted and very much UK-dependent plot into America? How will Jedberg and his actions make sense if he's on home soil? Where the fuck is Pendleton??""

Now, I am probably being unfair in many respects. I am sure the plot will be sufficiently convoluted and the portrayal of shady government business sufficiently unflattering and cold. I can see Mel as a shoe-in for an across-the-pond Craven. What I can't see is how this new Jedberg can be anything like the original Jedberg, or how this remake can possibly have the depth and sensitivity of the original.

Horror films (and genre films in general) are a great way to get noticed in the film industry and Raimi and Jackson and others are no fools.

Take an economics class.  The article stated to have a parking permit the city required a free standing commercial building.  So, the barrier to entry to have a parking lot (in that area) is about $100,000 plus the cost of running a business.  Running a parking lot **is** a business and city regulates business.  Plus the city is also involved in the business and has incentive to eliminate competitors.  If the price of parking is lower, then the city will wait longer for a return on its investment and taxpayers ultimately pay more taxes (or get fewer services).  I'm sure the accountants crunched these numbers before the stadium was made.

That said, if I can get my hands on an e-reader that meets my needs (haven't found one yet, although so far the iPad is sounding pretty good in that area), hell yeah I'll get one. While nothing will quite replace the coolness factor of a physical book,  and we have all these stupid rights issues to work out now that some publishers have gotten the idea to license books rather than selling them, e-readers definitely have some advantages to them:

1. I can fit a large number of books in a small amount of space. Our bookshelves are overflowing right now and we're running out of room for more. I'd love to be able to shrink that down.

2. With a good ereader, I should be able to search through a book's content. So the next time I find myself wanting to share a particular quote or scene with someone, I'd be able to find it.

3. Instant gratification. Books on demand. Woot!

4. Low weight and size for large books. I have tendonitis in my hands; very large books (like, for instance, ""The Stand"") are painful for me to handle. With an ereader that wouldn't be a problem.

5. Easy transport. Don't know what you'll want to read while on  your business trip? No problem! Bring a couple hundred books along!

6. Handicap accessibility. A good e-reader should ideally be able to do things like adjust font size, read text aloud, etc.

7. Publishers would have an easier time providing review books to reviewers if they could just send out digital books instead of printing up ARCs and FedEx'ing them---talk about a nice cost-cutting measure, which would hopefully end up eventually either reducing book price or going toward increasing book quality.

With all those advantages, I can't help but lust after an e-reader. I haven't yet seen one that blends the right price point and feature set for me, but I figure it's just a matter of time.","1264985045"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","&gt; Wait. Let's be real here. He is asking why they are expensive.

Indeed he is, so why did you take a statement I made about ease of use and apply it to the question of price? Leicas are expensive because they're made by hand, with expensive parts.


&gt; Aka, less customizable.

How is a Leica less customizable than any SLR? You buy a body and attach various lenses or other crap to it - every camera with interchangeable lenses and a flash shoe offer the same degree of customization.


&gt; The 5d has a better sensor.

Of course it does! The 5d body is huge and certainly has enough room to cram in the megapixels, but surprisingly it doesn't beat the M9 by such a massive margin. The M9 takes 5212x3472px (18mpx) large images and the 5dmkII shoots 5616x3744px (21mpx) large images - not really a big difference.


&gt; So sharp lenses on the leica are limited by the lack of detail the sensor produces.

This a poor argument that can be used against any digital camera ever produced. If you want to be nerdy about it you should check the MTF charts: [Canon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=152&amp;modelid=14259) [Leica Summilux-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH](http://en.leica-camera.com/service/downloads/lenses_for_rangefinder_cameras/summilux-m_50_mm_f14_asph/index.html)


&gt; Wow. Nice stretch. See, it doesn't have autofocus issues because it doesn't have autofocus.

This isn't really much of a stretch at all, it's just logic. Because rangefinders have a different fundamental approach to capturing an image they allow lens designers to perfect a simple lens design rather than struggle with a complex one. I've never been too fond of AF and prefer rangefinder focusing, so I'm perfectly willing to trade autofocus for image quality.

&gt; It's a luxury item because of the utility it had in the street-photography days of Cartier-Bresson.

I've covered this earlier, but if you want to get into the definition of luxury items let's compare the camera world to the car world. Porsche make about [100,000](http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/26/news/international/gumbel_porsche.fortune/index.htm) cars per year and Toyota make about [9 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/4311878/Toyota-overtakes-GM-as-worlds-largest-car-manufacturer.html) - a ratio of 1/90. Leica is rumored to produce around 10000 M9s per year and Canon sold about [4 million cameras](http://www.canon.com/ir/annual/index.html) in 2008 - a ratio of 1/400. So does this prove that an M9 can be viewed as more exclusive and luxurious than a Porsche? Not really, but you exaggerated your point, so I'm exaggerating mine. For me, it's not even about owning a peice of luxury, it's about owning a machine I like taking pictures with.


&gt; They are no longer a luxury item, no longer without competition

Remind me who else competes on the digital rangefinder market? The M9 is the only choice for consumers who are interested in this particular kind of camera DNA.


&gt; No, they don't. When you compare format-to-format, digital wins.

Most people agree that there is about 22 to 25 megapixels of useful information in a frame of 35mm film, so I agree that digital has matched 35mm film when it comes to information density. But there isn't a single full frame 35mm digital camera that can beat the exposure latitude of film. Most DSLRs offer 8-9 stops, and the high end might reach 11 stops. Film, however, does 13-14 stops out of the box and can pull off 20 stops when [processed correctly](http://figitalrevolution.com/2009/12/07/20-stop-dynamic-range-technique-tmy2-tmax400-pmk-kodak-leica/). I'm not going to bother arguing 35mm against medium format, but film still wins that game too.


&gt; Digital surged ahead of film in terms of color accuracy nearly a decade ago.

Color accuracy became a non issue as soon as computers perfected the art and expanded the possibilities. Any RAW file will be just as good as any scanned negative after both have been processed.


After all is said and done, I've come to realize that arguing RF against SLR is pointless. It all comes down to personal preferences that are informed by your particular brand of photographic philosophy. Personally, I appreciate the simple, yet precise and uncluttered approach to photography rangefinder cameras offer. Once I mastered the simple interface I realized that I was enjoying photography much more and I think it's because there is less camera between myself and the photographs I take.

EDIT: Just to be clear. I agree that the camera is crazy expensive, but any M9 owner will tell you it's worth it (not to mention the massive backorders every major camera store has). If anything, Leica found the perfect price.","1264985057"

So shoot back to the hotel room, my girlfriend turns to her mom and says something of the accord, ""I think you and dad no longer intimidate [therobot24].""

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Those who believe that math has corrupted economics don't really understand how the math is used. No economist (no good economist, anyway) treats the math as anything but a means to better understanding and communication, and the best economists are the ones who are able to extract the meaning (the ""intuition"") from the mathematical results

Actually, I think you have it backwards. I think the best economists are those who can coherently communicate relevant results to those who can use them (policy makers). This usually involves little to no math. 

Also, a lot of models are built to construct a mathematical logic to support intuition. Take trade theory. Hecksher-Olin models dominated for while because they made mathematical sense. Empirically though it was a massive failure. Modern trade theories such as gravity models started as empirically sound but had very little theory to justify them. Theory was then developed to support the results.   

If you look at the math in [Akrelof (1970)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons), a foundational paper for the study of asymmetrical info (he won the Nobel prize with Stiglitz and Spence for his work in this area), the algebra is nothing a 7th grader couldn't do, and the statistics aspect is almost nil (calculating expected values from a uniform distribution). 

Generally you need esoteric math for esoteric economics. The reason I study economics is to understand more about how the world actually works and hopefully develop some policies to make it work better. I liked the article (if you could call it that).

He also distanced himself from Clinton's policies (his own policies, in a sense) so that he could have a change aspect to himself (opinion piece [here](http://marylaine.com/observe/106.html) I don't have a more concrete link ATM).  

I would agree that Obama's campaign themes were definitely resonating with Bush discontent.  However, Obama had/has his own agenda.  He wasn't running on being ""the anti-Bush"".  As we've seen, he wasn't anti-war even though Bush seemed to be pro-war.  Obama was ""intelligent war.""  It's different from Bush, but it's not the opposite of Bush.  In fact, it incorporates the nastiest part of Bush's policies: the war part.

&gt;people didn't elect the leader they were hoping for.

Yes.  They elected the leader they voted for though.  So far, Obama has promised, explicitly, to do certain things and, for the most part, he has done them.  We all hoped he'd do more but he didn't campaign on a ""I'll read your mind and make you happy"" platform.  He made explicit promises and now we're seeing how he makes good on them.

I think this is where we differ.  I expect a politician to try and make good on the things he says he will do.  I'd like him to do the things I want that he hasn't addressed but I realize that's not always going to happen... in some cases, the politician may not even try to make them happen.

&gt;we are still contending with the same problems (torture, corporate favoritism, domestic spying, health care crisis) with no action from Obama

Case in point.  [Your link on torture](http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/01/nation/na-rendition1) opens by mentioning that Obama has removed ""harsh interrogation"" techniques from the options.  This was a part of [Obama's promise on ending torture](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/175/end-the-use-of-torture/).  Obama's promise also includes ending extreme rendition which he has not done.  The task force looking at the rendition process has 6 months from Jan (plus an extension) to evaluate the process and this looks like a promise Obama may try to get out of.  He needs to be pressured to keep his word on this one.  

Domestic spying is an issue Obama has [famously flip-flopped during the campaign](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/jul/14/obamas-wiretapping-flip-flop-yes/).  The campaign promise he settled on was to [increase oversight and accountability](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/180/end-warrantless-wiretaps/).  If he promised ""increased oversight"" domestic spying why would you expect him to end it?  Obama hasn't taken ""no action"" he's taken the action he said he would.

Similarly, the health care crisis hasn't been ""no action"".  As we've talked about, he's very much entrenched in that one.  It's not going as I would like but it isn't like Obama isn't taking action.  As I said, the leader people were hoping for isn't the leader Obama promised to be.  Talk to a diverse group of people and you'll seen that **no leader** could be the leader everyone of them is hoping for because each person hopes for something different.","1264985134"

Hell, I've got around 500 post-apocalyptic novels to read. My wife was envious of this, so I bought her an Eeepc, she didn't like it and wanted a PSP, so she's now enjoying her books that way.

The issue with search is that when working correctly it cannot find what people want.  This is because unless what you search for was specifically in the title, you will never find it.  Reddit search only searches titles.  There is no extra keyword field to help people search for things.

Searching comments is also not a fix since comments don't always have relevant info in them that ties to what was being linked to.  Also a search would have no idea what comment is more relevant than the others.  So search would be largely ineffective by searching comments, because comments are all over the place.  A post about michael jackson isn't always going to have a comment that repeats the name and if not in the title, searching for michael jackson will never return that post.

Most are proprietary and have a fee for access but the US Gov. offers this information as part of the [Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)](http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/).  You have to look up procedures under their ICD-9 code.  There is a link to a site that makes this easier.  rcrracer also lists some that may be useful to you.  No matter what the cost shown, if you are paying out-of-pocket, you can negotiate.  Just do it before the procedure or it is much harder.  If you get socked with a monster bill, you can contact companies that will review the bill for accuracy and usual and customary cost and many of them will negotiate with the hospital for you.  Having something as transparent as Kelly would be great.  And considering how byzantine car pricing is, it really reflects just how variable medical procedure costs can be.  In part, this is reasonable since no procedure is identical to any other similarly named procedure and any number of variables can arise that will legitimately change the cost for a given procedure.

For a lot of the vaguer ones, it's a matter of deciding after the fact ""oh, *that's* something that could count as fulfilling that prophecy"". If *anything* might count, eventually something will.

For some of the specific ones, we don't always know for sure when the passage was written - and for some that we do, the ""fulfilment"" is an after the fact edit that doesn't necessarily reflect what happened (a lot of the NT fulfilment of OT prophecy is after-the-fact addition with no external confirmation). Read up on bliblical textual criticism for some of this stuff.

So some wishful thinking, some post-hoc rationalization, some alteration of the text (there are more differences between all the different versions of some parts than there are words in those parts), a little bit of luck here and there, a few obvious predictions, and *carefully ignoring all the ones they got wrong*.

You SHOULD keep going to the gym. It keeps your brain and blood in great shape and makes it much less likely you'll die of a cardiovascular problem. Doesn't really help the fat storage issue though.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was working for a minor league baseball team at the time.  My boss asked me to move something across the stadium using a forklift.  I had never used a forklift before, so I got someone to show me how.  He spent all of 2 minutes explaining to me what stuff did, but I think I got a handle on it.

In order to get where the object I need to move is, there is a very steep hill, probably 200 feet long.  I start up the hill on the forklift, and halfway up an empty palette falls off the forks.  I put the emergency brake on and get out to pick it up.  As I do this, the forklift starts rolling down the hill.  Instinctively, I grab the forks to try and keep it from rolling.  It, uh, didn't work.  So now I am running after the thing as it rolls backwards.  I leap in the cab of the forklift with the idea of throwing the emergency brake.  When I get in, I realize it is already on.  At this point I am going backwards down a hill in a forklift, and have no idea what to do.  Somehow the forklift drifted to the side and slammed into a concrete wall, coming to a stop.

15 more feet and it would have hit a chainlink fence, and dumped me and the forklift 40 feet to the ground below.  If it had kept going down the hill, it would have smashed into a shed with mowers and tools and stuff.  Of all the different ways for the scenario to end, I think my dice rolled on the only one where I survived unscathed.","1264985357"

Haha I feel ya. I'll just leave this here.

**Edit:**

&gt;why did you take a statement I made about ease of use and apply it to the question of price? Leicas are expensive because they're made by hand, with expensive parts.

He asked why digital rangefinders were expensive. I assumed that, by responding, you were answering his question.

&gt;How is a Leica less customizable than any SLR? You buy a body and attach various lenses or other crap to it - every camera with interchangeable lenses and a flash shoe offer the same degree of customization.

I was speaking in terms of menus and settings, not physical customization (not that this matters, but DSLRs arguably win there too, with more lenses and accessories being produced).

&gt;Of course it does! The 5d body is huge and certainly has enough room to cram in the megapixels, but surprisingly it doesn't beat the M9 by such a massive margin. The M9 takes 5212x3472px (18mpx) large images and the 5dmkII shoots 5616x3744px (21mpx) large images - not really a big difference.

You said the leica produces shaper images because of superior lenses. Sharpness is a combination of lenses and sensor, and the 5d sensor produces sharper, higher resolution images than the leica, especially when using the sharp lenses you mention.

&gt;This a poor argument that can be used against any digital camera ever produced. If you want to be nerdy about it you should check the MTF charts

MTF charts have nothing to do with the sensor. They are a measurement of the lens. When comparing cameras, compare the cameras - the leica sensor *does not produce images with the same sharpness as the 5d II*. If you want to argue the lenses are better, that's fine, but it is not a pro-m9 argument because the lenses can be used on the 5d II.

&gt;I'm perfectly willing to trade autofocus for image quality.

I thought you were saying leica got rid of AF problems by not having AF. Your clarification changes things. Again, this is an argument about lenses, not cameras.

&gt;Most people agree that there is about 22 to 25 megapixels of useful information in a frame of 35mm film, so I agree that digital has matched 35mm film when it comes to information density. But there isn't a single full frame 35mm digital camera that can beat the exposure latitude of film. Most DSLRs offer 8-9 stops, and the high end might reach 11 stops. Film, however, does 13-14 stops out of the box and can pull off 20 stops when processed correctly. I'm not going to bother arguing 35mm against medium format, but film still wins that game too.

Due to a long response, I'll respond to this seperately

&gt;Personally, I appreciate the simple, yet precise and uncluttered approach to photography rangefinder cameras offer.

I also love rangefinders, and frequently use the m8 for street photography. My issue is arguing that they are better, make more sense for all-around shooting, or that the price somehow makes sense.

The price is for the name. The m8 is a lovely camera, but the price is *wrong*, just like it was in the film days.","1264985391"

It's true that people ignore those on trials, and often people won't play other players with a provisional rating, but even during that period I've never had to wait too long, maybe 5 minutes?

Channel 1 on ICC is the Help channel and there is a team of admins who are the only ones who can respond there. The longest I've ever had to wait for an answer was 5 minutes when I asked ""Why Windows 7 UAC flags Dasher, and is there way to keep it form being flagged?"" and they apparently spent some time googling how to disable UAC and a couple of other options that may have worked.

While I'm sure FICS has it as well, one of the best features I think is the ease at which you can play titled players, as there is a simul every day of the week.

The attractiveness of subcontractors has to do with limited corporate liability for a shittier product at a lower cost. It's a fuckface proven lame as crap business practice that is destructive to the infrastructure of america and the american workplace. The reason for this is you get into bidding wars, choose the cheapest guy, and then pay dearly for that ridiculous approach to quality assurance.

*The material of the failed O-ring was FKM which was specified by the shuttle motor contractor, Morton-Thiokol. FKM is not a good material for cold temperature applications.*

Kindly go straight to hell,asshole.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring#Challenger_disaster

*NASA wanted to check with all of its contractors to determine if there would be any problems with launching in the cold temperatures. Alan McDonald, director of the Solid Rocket Motor Project at Morton-Thiokol, was convinced that there were cold weather problems with the solid rocket motors and contacted two of the engineers working on the project, Robert Ebeling and Roger Boisjoly. Thiokol knew there was a problem with the boosters as early as 1977, and had initiated a redesign effort in 1985. NASA Level I management had been briefed on the problem on August 19, 1985. Almost half of the shuttle flights had experienced O-ring erosion in the booster field joints. Ebeling and Boisjoly had complained to Thiokol that management was not supporting the redesign task force.*

*One of the most important issues deals with engineers who are placed in management positions. It is important that these managers not ignore their own engineering experience, or the expertise of their subordinate engineers. Often a manager, even if she has engineering experience, is not as up to date on current engineering practices as are the actual practicing engineers. She should keep this in mind when making any sort of decision that involves an understanding of technical matters.Another issue is the fact that managers encouraged launching due to the fact that there was insufficient low temperature data. Since there was not enough data available to make an informed decision, this was not, in their opinion, grounds for stopping a launch. This was a reversal in the thinking that went on in the early years of the space program, which discouraged launching until all the facts were known about a particular problem.*


The root of the challenger explosion was mismanagement due to inexperience and ego, combined with a shitty product made by an outside contractor, that was then implemented in an untested situation. Overconfidence, ignorance, subcontractors, fail. You got the first two down.

Two changes for you. 

As has already been pointed out, you're just not using enough coffee.  ""2 scoops per pot"" you say.  How big is your pot?  I have both small and large french presses.  For the smaller one which yields maybe three cups, I use three heaping scoops.  Rule of thumb - one scoop per cup and one for the pot.  

Secondly, while the type / origin of the coffee is one important factor, the roast is equally important.  I don't know about the Keurig but *$$  (and probably your local bodega) use a dark roast.   I like the dark dark darky stuff myself and French roast is about as light as I like.   I use a blend of double french and espresso roasted beans (organic Sumatra Mandelhing mostly).

When you look at it from a typical socialogical perspective it doesn't make sence, but if you look at it from a biological point of view it makes perfect sence.  Happens in nature all the time.  When an organism is in an environment that is hostile, they have more children so more have a chance of surviving long enough to procreate.  Once the organism has reached the end of its breeding usefulnes, it is no longer all that beneficial to the species and so the average life span decreases.  More resources are put into the strong young than the weaker old.  

In these situations, human life has become amazingly efficient at doing one thing... and that is, to create more human life.

"funny","t5_2qh33","actually, the PPC 970 was abandoned because it was impossible to get the damn thing to run cool enough to fit in a laptop. If you remember, a lot of people were pissed off because the Powerbooks were stuck on G4 chips for at least 18 months after the towers switched to G5s.

The PPC970 was a scaled-down server chip (the POWER4). It was very powerful (much faster than the Intels at the time) but the damn thing was power-hungry and ran incredibly hot. The Dual G5 (which I still own) has a fuck-off big liquid cooling array to stop the damn chip from melting through the case!

now IBM never intended the chip to run in anything but servers, and they didn't really want to spend the millions in R&amp;D that it'd take to get the chip energy-efficient and cool enough to run in a laptop. Hell, it took over a year to cram it into an iMac. Apple was their only customer outside of their server division so the motivation was never there.

So Apple has no choice but to drop them and switch to Intels. They'd been developing OSX for intel behind the scenes for years just in case this situation came up, so the software was no problem. The biggest hurdle was the backpeddle required on the marketing side, being as Apple had been panning Intels for years. But they managed to pull it off. The first generation of Intel macs came 18 months after the Dual Quad G5 towers, and were only 10-20% faster, which says something about the quality of the PPC 970 chips.

The successor to the G5 chip, the POWER5 is still in use in IBM's Big Iron servers.","1264985584"

Tablature is so much more flexible whereas notation can be so restrictive. In earlier periods of music where standard forms were more prominent (medievil, baroque, classical) I believe notation would rarely find it's limits, now almost every day I see notation with scrawls of hand written notes above it giving additional input, so many accidentals that it renders the key practically redundant, translations from Latin to English because, sorry to break it to you, practicality should override tradition and we do in fact, speak English nowadays.

Fun Fact #2: From IMDB - ""The first 30 minutes of the film has a background noise with a frequency of 28Hz (low frequency, almost inaudible), similar to the noise produced by an earthquake. In humans, it causes nausea, sickness and vertigo. It was the main cause of people walking out of the theaters during the first part of the film in places like Cannes and San Sebastian.

E.g., if something goes wrong after the golem has been created, and the golem begins destroying the village, it is possible to destroy it: 

* If you created the golem by writing EMETH on it's forehead, erase the first E, causing it to read METH or ""death"". 
* If you created it by placing the name of God in it's mouth, remove the parchment. 
* If you recited the words of creation ""if one wants to return [the golem] to the dust, one should [recite the sequence in] the opposite order""

And, if you were wondering about the possibility of the golem killing you, ""This is entirely within the realm of possibility. Golems seem more uncontrollable the longer they have been in existence. Thus, the longer you use the golem, the more likely it will rampage.""

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'm always impressed by (some, certainly not all) atheists' comfort with abandoning the very scientific world view they claim supersedes the religious one. One of the first thing anyone learns in statistics is that correlation is not the same thing as causation. These people are not worse off because they pray, they're plagued by the same problems of poverty as any other poor area of the country. 
Secondly, the idea that praying or being religious would produce any material gains is repulsive to any sensible religious mind. What kind of crap god tries to bribe you into worshiping him with money? Not one worth following, that's for sure. Proven indicators of crime rates and shortened lifespans are, however, rooted in a few things: social and geographic mobility, low incomes, and poor education. Not religiosity. Nobody should be, or is, better off in a social or material way just because they're religious. Morally, of course, the goal of religion(s) is to raise one's moral footing, but in places like Mississippi that have huge uneducated, unemployed, and socially isolated and oppressed ethnic groups, you're going to have those problems. That's survival instinct and greed, not religion.

Lastly, people being poor and people having their prayers answered are totally separate issues. God gives us what we need, not what we want. It's up to us to react accordingly.","1264985692"

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","Not too bad,  FYI the main reason (as I understand it) for the return air duct, is that it is nearly impossible to get balanced heating of the entire house without it.  IE the rooms further-est from the heater will have much less flow when doors are closed so you will open the vents more, then they will have much more flow with doors open, so you need to keep the doors in the same arrangement (preferably open).  My house (manufactured, single floor) already has a single return vent at the heater (same as yours now).  To solve this issue most of the doors have a louvers over them that pass the return air.  The other doors do not go all the way to the top/bottom of the frame to allow flow.  Also with most homes having the heater in the basement, you are now heating the basement.  If you were heating the basement anyway, this makes sense.
Also this might only save you because of the whole house wrap.  Without the wrap it would be easier for the heater to pull in more outside air, and the furthest away rooms would build pressure and push the inside air outside when the fan is running.  With the house wrap this is tighter and less prevalent.  The down side of not being well balanced heating is the people in the unbalanced rooms will turn the whole house heat up more to be comfortable.
Also it is generally more efficient to pull in the higher/hotter air for cooling in the summer, and pull in the lower cooler air in the winner (cycles the heat/AC fan less often).  so they used to put in louvers to close the lower inlet vents in summer.  Except in your case where it appears your in the basement, if the basement is naturally cool in the summer sucking the upstairs heat into the basement with your new vent seams good.","1264985697"

some more food for thought:


patents are bad for lots of reasons:

 * expensive at about $20K or so per patent, and that's just for US protection.
 * they take *years* to get approval
 * they explain to your competition exactly what you have invented (obviously.)


they are good for two things:

 * marketing (impressing investors, scaring competition, etc.)
 * protecting yourself from getting sued by someone else in the industry


coming up with some idea, and then filing for a patent, but then not going forward with a business is kind of useless.  *generally* speaking, patents are relatively easy to work around - and fighting with someone who you think stole your idea is *expensive* and time consuming.

It was just a random attack by a gang of rough kids from the rough side of town so they were utter badasses compared to me, you know total chav yob villains, but I knew the dudes name. So years later, I met this girl in a pub who I found out was his long term girlfriend. So I tricked her in to thinking I was rich and interesting (easiest way to get laid) and spent the next three or four weekends shagging her and taking naked photos of her (not showing you because it was on a film camera and the photos are long gone)
I then got this motherfuckers phone number off her by saying he was an old mate and asked if I could give him a call. She was reluctant because she thought I was gonna spill the beans and drop her in it for shagging my deceptive ass but I assured her otherwise.
So I call him and spend the next 10 minutes reminding him of the timne he humiliated a random stranger 10 year old kid in a shop in 1991 by pulling his pants down. He didn't remember (but I knew it was him)... I ended the call by saying ""WELL GUESS WHAT YOU CUNT I'VE JUST SHAGGED YOUR GIRLFRIEND TWENTY FUCKING TIMES YOU UTTER UTTER CUNT, FUCK YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!""

I had to spend the next few weekends in relative hiding because he was an absolute psycho by all accounts, but his mangy girlfriend didn't reveal my address to him (weak point in my masterplan) and yeah, it will basically be the only interesting thing I will be able to tell my grandchildren.","1264985754"

"sto","t5_2rfq3","Ignoring the bugs and server uptime problems since they're just the teething problems every MMO goes through. I think the real chance of success for STO comes from the fact that it's going to be the WoW of space games.

The combat is simple, but the skill/gear system leaves the door open for min/maxing. There's lots of mechanics to build interesting gameplay off as well, with new takes on the fantasy genres tank, dps, healer/buffbot roles. I just hope they expand on it to the point where there's diversity in the fights. I mean part of WoW's success comes from it's unique raiding, if STO can blend it's PvP with some epic WoW-esque space battles. Eg, fighting space stations that have ""over the top"" abilities, forcing players to move to safe spots to avoid dmg or taking out its defense turrets as they are repaired while another group works on the shield generators.

So that said, the mechanics have potential so far (even the ground combat skills are interesting, though i'll readily admit the pathfind and ai is a litle funky).

Getting back the 6 month and dead topic though, it's really up to cryptic to decide what they're going to make of it. Star Trek has a large fan base who'll play it regardless the real deal breaker is up to how many casual players they can get it. Age of Conan was one of the first of the ""next-gen"" mmo's that really just leeched players who were waiting for their favourite fantasy mmo to get a content update. Warhammer online, while fun and well-made was always going to run in to trouble considering WoW has a very similar style/humour and has been in development for 6 years. Plus all of these games focus on an individual character, STO is only shouldering in on EVE's market... and even then, EVE and STO seem like completely different games. Eve revolves around relentless realism and STO looks like it will be aiming to just be ""fun"".

If Cryptic were to hire me to help develop the game (I'm open to the offer!) then I'd give them the following advise:

* Killing 50 of something in an AI fleet battle to move on to the next phase won't cut it for the end-game. If you intend to have a PvE option at the level cap, then you should take a feather from WoW's cap. Epic space battles against space stations/planetary defenses that require real teamwork to beat is what will keep your players playing PvE-wise. If there isn't at least one max-level PvE event that stays unbeaten for the next couple of months then I'll be dissapointed!

* I haven't played much PvP yet, but I've heard there's some concern about winning pvp battles being about the team that focusses their fire the most. If this is the case at the level cap, then you need put some thought in to slowing it down. Buff shields/regen slightly, improve the UI for healing ships in fleets, introduce more mechanics to mitigate and avoid damage.

* Improve the way the UI presents the skills and mechanics. From what I've read all the numbers you see on gear are actually percentages increases/decreases, if so, why not put a % sign on the end of ""10 Starship Sensors"" to make it perfectly clear. And there really needs to be better descriptions of how everything relates to each other. Does starship sensors just increase your ability to see things near by? If so, why doesn't the tooltip on your character/starship sheet tell you that?

* At the moment my action bars are a very bland pallette of blue and white. Colour coding the abilities icons for your action bars will make them a lot easier to read. (Red = tactical, yellow = eng, blue = science, white = general).

* Add some form of macro'ing. At the moment I'm a tachyon beam science ship. This requires me to switch back and forth between 2 power profiles a lot, if I could say ""Switch to Aux power -&gt; then next time I click fire tachyon beam -&gt; next time I click switch back to attack power"" then it'd save me a lot of frantic clicking.

* Rethink how the AI will will work in ground combat. The skills and abilities seem rounded enough, it's just a little simple right right now. Perhaps thats just down to it just being early level, but right now there are only 2 useful characters in my away team. Myself and my healbot, the rest are just there to spread the damage around. I hope at level cap fights will require some level of tank, healer and crowd control coordination. Otherwise it's just going to get old fast (like the kill 50 of ship X fleet battles). That said, I really like the different types of enemies there are (animal handlers/grenadiers/mortars). With a little more refining these distinct enemy types could easily translate in to fun gameplay, though I hope there will be slightly more ""bosslike"" encounters at level-cap.","1264985775"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Right, so this isn't my own, but it's my favorite. Happened to a couple friends of mine who used to date. They're going at it when my buddy pulls out and realizes his dong is covered in blood. He asks if she's on her period. Apparently she forgot. Being a good sport, he suggested anal instead, so instead of cleaning up some of the blood from the sheets and their bodies, they begin having anal intercourse. Again my buddy pulls out. Not only is his penis covered in feces, but it seems to have opened the flood-gates of poo, getting him and his sheets very messy indeed. Now here's where it gets weird. Instead of kicking her out of his apartment or even cleaning up, he is too awkward and embarrassed to even point out that they are covered in and surrounded by shit. They cuddled in it for hours. And that's how futons get ruined. ","1264985790"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Actually I think it is the point.    Few people advocate writing all of their code in asm which is the straw man that temp_001 implies.

Demonstrating that compilers are not optimal (and by a significant margin) seems to be a good way to counter the argument that asm is redundant because compilers are good enough.  In areas where execution performance is an issue, (and any non-io bound problem that takes a noticeable amount of time, it is an issue) you want the best code in the areas where the time goes.  If compilers are inadequate for this task then it is worth knowing about.

temp_001 has suggested this limitation is isolated.  mansr has offered to demonstrate this is not the case.  He may be wrong, but I'd prefer people give them the chance to make the case rather than just systematically going through and downvoting everything they said.

"politics","t5_2cneq","No, I'm not going to downvote you, but that's your opinion, and not very well substantiated at that (no offense). 

The Federal Reserve's policies keep unemployment at around 5-6% in the long term, something conservative economist Milton Friedman won a Nobel Prize for. Of course, given our rather volatile economy since the 70's, that could be up to question. 

So, in other words, you CANNOT have everyone on a job. It is impossible in our capitalist system. The best society can do is rotate these positions around. It has little to do with who is able-bodied, and who isn't, unless you wish for the government to compel everyone into a position they don't want to be in. 

Actually we already have that, we call them ""involuntary part-time"" jobs... ;)

Another thing I want to add is - the vast majority of Americans do not own any significant portion of capital, aside from their homes and maybe a few stock options, usually not worth more than a few thousand. If you're living from paycheck to paycheck (""able-bodied,"" as you put it) then you do not have an option. 

You MUST pay for rent, utilities, etc. 

You MUST show up to work at specific times and days of the week, something your boss, not you, decides.

By the way, I am not a progressive or liberal. I am a left-wing individualist anarchist, and there is much to be said about the supposed ""liberty"" we get from keeping government out of business, but apparently not the other way around. ","1264985824"

Lawyers frequently advise their clients to lie and will do anything to help their clients - if they are good attorneys, that is. The line between legal and not legal is very thin. You could commit two extremely similar crimes and get acquitted one time and 25 years the second time. Lawyers know how to do just enough so that either they don't break the law - but almost - or they break the law and make it  impossible to prove (they, after all, know what is necessary to prove a crime in court).

Yes the system is broken and has been for a while. This event has shown our weaknesses and hopefully we learn something from all of this. The housing costs in Vancouver are more complicated that people think they are. Yes there is some fact to the housing developers' lobby but remember, we are an ever expanding city with the best climate in Canada one of the best in the World so it stands to reason that with limited space for expansion and there being a high demand for housing, the costs are going to be unnaturally high. Look at Japan for example.

Personally, I was quite upset with the actual ticket sales and the prices that they are going at now (I think VANOC should have capped the prices in the auction), because a $22 ticket should never be sold for $200 even if event host is doubling down on his income...

Either way, I get to make connections and as a university student this is vital to me as in about 2 years, I'll be in the real world, looking for a job. 

Plus, it really is a unique opportunity, and for most people, a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"", to host the olympics and to take part (however minor it may be) in an event on the world stage.

Then when that was over, they showed a guy standing around taking balls to the head, then it would transition to a kid playing with jello and then repeat with a different ball and different jello cup each time.

On the street in front of the gallery was a dance for jesus group. They were really bad dancers, and the music was cheesy jesus rock covers.

This is a power struggle between immensely powerful organizations, and most people in the world choose to ""receive"" their wisdom from science, or the alternative.

&gt;Male chicks are useless to the egg industry and are ground up alive shortly after hatching. Hens have their lives cut severely short (as in, less than half of their natural life) when they stop producing eggs fast enough, when they are slaughtered and turned into fertilizer or fast food meat. These are aspects of the egg industry that are shared by both factory and family farms.

and

&gt;Theoretically, someone could acquire a rescued hen and a rescued rooster and start a hatchery where all roosters live out their lives and all hens live out their lives. This would result in a) crazy expensive eggs and b) a big waste of resources to keep non-productive animals alive.

Another factor, IMO, is to keep idealism to a minimum.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; most humans are fat, stupid, lazy parasites.

I like to reframe this sentiment as ""humans revert to *efficiency* whenever possible.""

Humans evolved in an environment of scarcity, and those who conserved energy at every opportunity were more likely to survive than those who wasted their resources. Thus, now, when given a choice, most of us will choose the path that requires the least independent thought, movement, effort, and initiative, while still allowing us to reach our goals. 

While advances in technology have brought us many awe-inspiring advantages, there has been one terrible side effect: In modern society, we can now almost always choose to exert little or *no* effort -- sweet calorie-dense food and passive entertainment can be brought right to us as we nap in our snuggies on our comfy couches. 

That we end up fat, stupid, and lazy is simply the natural and inevitable result of the surfeit of riches our modern lifestyle brings. We all now have the ability to conserve more physical and intellectual energy that we could *ever* need -- so much so that we are literally burdened with excess reserves that we carry around with us everywhere, in the form of love handles and brain cells that have never been used and accessories that we will just throw away when the new fashion season rolls around. 

We would all be so much better off if, as a society, we acknowledged that most of us are fat, stupid, and lazy not due to a lack of willpower or some other personal 'fault', but due to our *species* having evolved for a lifetyle that bears little resemblance to the one we now find ourselves living. 

Similarly, we would be better off if we would acknowledge that encouraging people to pursue health, intellectual curiousity, and industry will never occur through nagging them to be *less* efficient (e.g., to exercise, think, or work when it isn't necessary for immediate survival; to eat lower-calorie food when higher-calorie food is readily available), and then berating them or shaming them when they not-surprisingly choose efficiency instead. This prod-and-shame route fights thousands of years of evolution, and has been clearly shown not to work -- not only on a society-wide level, but by everyone who's ever had parents who attempt to change their behavior through nagging and grounding.

The solution then lies in acknowledging and even embracing our human drive towards efficiency. We have to either (1) make the 'valued' choice the 'more efficient' choice - e.g., make recycling easier or less expensive than throwing something in the trash; make walking easier or much less expensive than driving; make nutritious food cheaper and easier to prepare than junk food, etc., and/or (2) eliminate or heavily tax options that are more efficient, but worse for us - e.g., remove some food ""choices"" from grocery stores or restaurants; make throwing things away, or being sedentary, or being lazy, more difficult and more expensive than reusing, or being healthy, or being industrious. 

Combining both techniques may provide the most return. For example, if we want to get people to learn about science, we must (1) make learning about it easier than not learning, and/or (2) make not learning about science 'expensive'. Right now, we teach science in an effortful way, stressing rote memorization and abstract concepts, when most learners respond to appeals to their natural empiricism (humans like to observe things or try things and see what happens), memorization through graduated repetition, and concrete application of the concepts to their direct lives. If we taught science in a manner that meshed well with how most people learn, learning about science in the classroom would most likely be easier than *not* learning. If we then made scientific knowledge necessary or useful for everyday living, or made ignorance 'expensive' in terms of time or money or resources, even people who might not be motivated by the teaching methods might be motivated to learn science simply to make things easier on themselves.

Adding the searching for comments does nothing to improve searching because comments don't have to ever describe the link or use words in them that are topically connected to the link.

They can, but how does that help you find anything?  Top comments tend to be jokes that if searched would not help you find the link or know what a link is about.  And there is nothing that helps find a link based on how popular it is.  Since it's popularity does not mean the text in the title accurately describes what is linked to.

Google search does not help.  If I am searching for a certain topic, google search is worse than reddit's current search.  Since google searches all comments also.

He scratched her arm, then brutally grabbed it, hit her, tried to punch her face while screaming, “You liar!,” kicked her and dragged her to the edge of a flight of concrete stairs. Student David Hakimfar, who witnessed the assault, wrote in an on-line article in Jewsweek, “This was no brief moment of insanity. It was a long and deliberate attack. He was aware of his surroundings. Seidler-Feller was belligerently trying to find any means to strike Neuwirth.” According to an article that collected testimony from a number of eyewitnesses,  Dr. Roberta Seid says she saw Rabbi Seidler-Feller's face contorted in rage as he dragged Ms. Neuwirth towards the stairs and tried to push her down. It took three students to pull off the rabbi from his victim, but as soon they separated him from her, he lurched at her again. If not for the fact that Ms. Neuwirth is an athlete with enough physical strength to resist his pushing, Rabbi Seidler-Feller could well have succeeded in shoving her down a flight of concrete stairs, possibly breaking her neck. ](http://www.michnews.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/373/16608)","1264986047"

The More Creatine You Take, The Better?

You've seen those sick bodybuilders chugging down 10-20 grams of creatine. Is it worth it? According to scientists at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, at 0.1 grams per kilogram of bodyweight, male athletes excreted 46% of the ingested creatine within 24 hours. For a 220 pound lifter, this means that if he consumes 10g of creatine, 46%, or 4.6g of creatine, is wasted. In another study performed at the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University, scientists confirmed that lower doses of creatine monohydrate (5g/day) are effective, and that results can even be achieved without a loading phase. 

Creatine Loading Is Mandatory?

Once again, research is proving that less creatine is needed to deliver results. The research cited above also suggests that creatine loading may be nothing more than a waste. Should you load? In most cases, probably not. If you're an elite athlete, a professional bodybuilder or competitive powerlifter, you may want to consider loading, just in case. For the rest of us, 5g is all it takes. 

Creatine Harms The Kidneys And Liver? 

Unless you have a pre-existing medical condition, creatine use should not damage your kidneys or liver. Most of the hype has been the result of anecdotal reports. In one study which tracked healthy athletes over a five-year period, football players who used creatine at levels up to 15.75g of creatine per day showed no effect on markers of renal or kidney stress. In another study conducted by Dr. Kerry Kuehl at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland and presented at the 2000 annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine, the kidney function of 36 healthy male and female athletes who consumed 10g of creatine per day was examined. After twelve weeks, Dr. Kuehl found that creatine did not adversely affect kidney function. 

Creatine Causes Excessive Water Retention? 

More bullshit. A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that, after three months of creatine use, test subjects showed no significant increase in body water. In fact, the creatine group showed greater gains in total body mass and fat-free mass. Best of all, this recent study employed the latest in body composition measurements-deuterated water isotopic analysis which utilizes a non-radioactive ""tracer"". Now it is possible that some inferior-grade creatine may actually promote water gain that results in a soft, puffy look. However, this can be due to several reasons. One, it may not be due to the creatine, but excess sodium. When cheaply manufactured, excess sodium remains in the finished product. 

Creatine Causes Cramping?

The idea that creatine use causes muscle cramping is anecdotal with no clinical evidence to support this claim. On the contrary, clinical studies show that creatine use is not associated with cramping. In one study, researchers examine 16 men who either supplemented with creatine or a placebo. Under specific dehydration conditions, the occurrence of cramping and tightness were reported in both groups, but ""nothing that would suggest a greater incidence associated with creatine supplementation."" Two other studies conducted at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro fond that creatine use by 61 Division I athletes during training camps had no effects on the incidence of muscle cramps, injury or illness. These athletes used 15-25g per day on the loading phase, and another 5g/day as maintenance. 

Creatine Needs To Be Taken With Grape Juice?

The concept behind taking creatine with sugar such as grape juice is sound. But the trick is not the grape juice per serving. It has to do with insulin's function in the body. For creatine uptake to be enhanced, insulin release should be encouraged. Insulin functions as a kind of creatine pump, pushing it into muscles. If you're going to stick to juice, make sure you get at least 100g of juice for every 5g of creatine. Depending on your level and your goals, juice loaded with sugars may not be suitable. Newer research indicates that you can take your creatine with protein for the same results. A new study reports that taking 5g of creatine with 50g of protein/47g of carbs produced the same results as taking 5g with 96g of carbs. 

Creatine Works Better In A Liquid Form?

In fact, in liquid form, you may not even be getting creatine, but creatinine, a by-product of creatine breakdown. Creatine, in powder form, is extremely stable. When exposed to an acidic environment or moisture for a long time, creatine will begin to break down into worthless creatinine. The citric and phosphoric acids found in many liquid creatines, which are used to preserve the shelf life of these products, actually helps break creatine down. So as a rule of thumb, if you're going to make a creatine shake, drink it by the end of the day. 

All Creatines Are The Same?

Just as there is a difference between $100 champagne and $15 dollar champagne, there's a difference between high-quality creatine and inferior-grade creatine. Traditionally, Chinese creatine is a lower quality product, with more contaminants such as creatinine, sodium, dicyandiamide, and dihydrotriazine. German creatine, from companies such as SKW, are cleaner, purer products. 

New Forms Of Creatine Work Better?

News flash: no form of creatine has been proven in published studies to work better than plain old creatine monohydrate powder. Whether you're spending your extra dollar on effervescent, liquid or chewable creatine, the most important consideration is the creatine. And whether you decide to splurge and buy creatine citrate or creatine phosphate remember one thing: the major clinical studies have been performed on plain creatine monohydrate powder. Numerous studies have also shown that creatine powder is easily assimilated by the body. So unless you've got money to burn, stick with creatine monohydrate powder. Products such as effervescent creatine or creatine chewables offer convenience and a novel way to take plain old creatine powder. For real value, there's no better choice than powder. 

Creatine Use Is 100% Safe? False.

While creatine is non-toxic, creatine use is not wholly risk-free. As with all other nutritional supplements, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions should not take creatine or other sports supplements. For example, there have been at least one case study which reported kidney inflammation in subjects who used creatine. However, in one case, the patient had a pre-existing kidney problem. So before you begin supplementing with anything, the best advice is to see your physician. 

Creatine Is Ideal For All Athletes? 

Some athletes stand to benefit a great deal, others very little. Athletes who require sudden, high intensity bursts of power and strength are ideal candidates for creatine supplements. These athlete might include powerlifters, bodybuilders, sprinters, football, baseball, and basketball players, and the like. Endurance athletes or those who participate in sports which require steady aerobic output may not benefit from creatine use. 

You Can Get Enough Creatine From Your Diet?

The average person gets only about 1g of creatine per day from his diet. When you cook your meals, you also destroy a good part of the creatine found in foods such as beef, cod, salmon, and herring.

# Creatine makes you fat. This is impossible! It’s not uncommon for lifters to report an almost immediate gain of weight when they start taking creatine. This is due to water retention inside the muscles, not fat gain. This is also known as “water weight”.

I hypothesize that the vast majority of all debates/discussions of political issues are unsatistying (and ultimately wastes of time) because participants fail to communicate and understand the true source of their disagreement.  Here are just a few principles that, if adhered to, would improve the quality of debate:

* Important facts should be explicitly stated.
* If a fact is disputed, clearly state all relevant evidence.  If this does not resolve the factual dispute, summarize how different interpretations of the evidence can lead to different conclusions and move on.
* Arguments should consist of a premise and conclusion.  A strong argument must support both the premise and the causal relationship between premise and conclusion with factual evidence.  If an argument can only be partially supported, or is supported by facts under dispute, this should be clearly noted to enable future additions/revisions.
* Participants should not take the viewpoint of advocates of a particular viewpoint, but rather collaborators in the search for the truth.

These principles are imperfect (off the top of my head) and I'm sure many more could be added, but it's a start.  An ideal system, in my opinion, would not only enable and preserve an ongoing, online debate, but also actively encourage ""good"" behavior like that described above.

I agree that a platform like this could be extremely useful.  It would also be extremely hard to do well.  I think a successful effort would need to incorporate knowledge/research from many areas, including formal debate, large-scale online collaboration, web design, and psychology.","1264986085"

&gt;Shifting less than one day per week's worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.

Quoted in the NEF's report- Re-framing the great food debate: The case for sustainable food. 

The original source they quote is a paper by Weber and Matthews (2008): Food-miles and the relative climate impacts of food choices in the United States' *Environmental Science &amp; Technology* 42(10):3508-3513

I could provide numerous examples, but I'm afraid I'll have to dig through my papers. The debates around food are really extremely complicated, but the reasoning behind red meat and dairy is fairly straightforward. Basic food chain dynamics and biology show that in order to survive, creatures higher up the food chain require more base inputs. So for example, a pound of grain only requires a small amount of water over its lifetime compared to the thousands of gallons required to make a burger. In addition, you have to consider that plants remove GHG's from the environment, while animals add them to the environment. More specifically, cows release huge quantities of methane, another GHG which tends to receive much less attention.","1264986093"

Because that prevents the truth from getting out. When it's said ( incorrectly, but slightly so) that they are linked together to conspire against us, many rational people will reject the idea of an oligarchy because they find that notion paranoid and irrational. As it (sorta) is.
However a small adjustment in the notion will correct it. The Oligarchy is not *against* the pursuit of happiness of the people, they are just consumed with the pursuit of their own pleasure, that it have no limits. The disruption of others pursuits is just a by product of their selfish actions. So lets not confuse the issue, they don't have a conspiracy to prevent people from the pursuit of happiness, it just happens because they do nothing but pursue their own happiness.

People hate this minigame because they immediately feel like they have an OCD obligation to deplete every single system they encounter.  Why?  There's no quest or achievement for it.  I've only mined out three systems, and even then I had way, way too many minerals to research everything I needed.  I could've gotten with mining only six planets, with each taking about 3-5 minutes to mine out.

The resource gathering in ME2 is a cakewalk by comparison.  No matter how big the planet is, the relative scanning size will always be the same.  How fast your mouse move is dictated by you, not restrained by an inherent speed cap like the Mako.  There is no frustrating ""scanning"" over rugged terrain, and all the side missions have you dropped straight into the thick of the action instead of spending 15 minutes driving there.

Mako sucked horribly, and the worst part was that it was a gimmick that ended up becoming a core mechanic of the game.  That simply does not work.  It's like the inevitable vehicle mission in any CoD game, where you're either riding away from bad guys or shooting them shotgun while another NPC is driving.

"science","t5_mouw","Sorry, this explanation is based on science folklore (refuted, no less).
 
Sliding on snow (or ice) is not caused by pressure-induced water melting. Your children would have to be as heavy as elephants for this effect to be seen. 
 
It is the friction of motion that melts the ice and creates the lubricating layer. Pressure has nothing to do with it. 
Link:[Skating and science](http://www.skridsko.net/klubbar/data/science.html)
 
Now, back to the OP's question. Friction produces the same amount of frictional heat in the case of one sled with two kids or two sleds with two kids. That means that the same amount of lubricant (liquid water) will be created. However, when there are two sleds, it is spread more thinly (the contact area is twice as much). This probably accounts for the difference.

Her book is about (what she calls) *rational* self-interest, not hedonism, not self-interested whims. She is against both. 

While she was a pretty good example of a vulgar libertarian, that still does not discount her philosophy of the non-initiation of force. (though her extrapolations I don't agree with in some instances, as I am an agorist)

one of my favorite hitchen's quotes (paraphrasing) ""Love thy enemy? You can go love your own enemies, I want to destroy mine""(**Edit**: it was ""Go love your own enemies; by the way, don't be loving mine""). She said the same thing, her entire critique of collectivism is that same idea that one should not love indiscriminately.

Man should not seek to leach off of others. Man should live for his own sake, not for another's. Man should not initiate force against another man or his property. It is virtuous to be productive and not destructive in one's pursuits.

What a disgusting philosophy? right?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to live and go to school in Canada, and I was driving to Banff for a winter trip one time. It was late at night, and I reached the top of Roger's Pass (known to be the most dangerous stretch of the Canada RT 1), and I pass a car which had obviously been in a wreck.

To make this a short story: I pulled a drunk homeless bum out of his car, set him in my car, covered him in a -45 degree sleeping bag even though he pissed himself and was covered in blood. It was -25 outside. I then found another car with a stunned looking 20 year old standing on the median, and he asked me if his bro was going to be ok. Said brother was bleeding from every orifice, and had an eyeball hanging out of his head. The kid's friend, on the other hand was crushed into a 1 foot space in the back, so I got the sleeping bag and covered the still alive friend in the back. I was almost sure he was going to die. I brought the brother over to another car which pulled up, and we had them drive to get help (no cellphone reception). 45 minutes later, I am being interviewed by the RCMP, and give a VERY detailed description of the situation which put the bum in jail for involuntary manslaughter 2 years later, when I was subpoenaed to come up and testify. The survivor in back looked about 45 years old and had a walker, even though he was my age at the time, which was 25. We talked for awhile, and he thanked me, and started to cry.

edit: I forgot to mention that if I had left 1-2 minutes earlier, it would have been me who could have died.","1264986274"

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","No one has tested it outside of a gravity well (*clocks in orbit aren't entirely outside of the effects of earth's gravity). Interstellar travel is a new situation.  We can't be certain that there isn't some variable that we aren't considering. Classical mechanics went a couple hundred years before relativity was introduced. Interpolating and extrapolating are different things. Our math might on it might not be right.  Say for arguments sake there is a limit to how much time can dilate, time will shift but it has a minimum pace that isn't stopped.  All our current observations could be right while our theories are wrong.  It could be like making predictions using the pythagorean theorem about all isosceles triangles because the only ones we've experienced are isosceles right triangles. So yes, I think it is possible relativity might not be right.  We are far from omniscient.

*Sending a probe on a dry run would be better than packing extra food.  We'd have better data for the manned run.  Sacrificing people to the depths of space due to ignorance shouldn't be risked when it can be avoided. Dark matter is of much greater concern to me than hypothetical problems with relativity.  If we don't do unmanned test runs I'd want extra fuel, supplies, and shielding.","1264986275"

&gt; As an ordained Presbyterian minister, and a man of tremendous faith, Mister Rogers preached tolerance first. Whenever he was asked to castigate non-Christians or gays for their differing beliefs, he would instead face them and say, with sincerity, “God loves you just the way you are.” Often this provoked ire from fundamentalists.

i had finished my degree in agricultural economics the spring before, had volunteered on an organic farm, grew up on my parents hobby farm, but otherwise didn't have a whole lot of hands-on knowledge. so i proposed to my like-minded cohort that we take the lack of responsibility in our lives and make the most of it! he was down, and we researched and applied to several internships via http://attra.ncat.org. we were there until may and after that internship ended we wwoofed our way back home. 

 it was a great experience- learned all about sustainable gardening. goats, forestry, natural building, homesteading, boat building, RAM pumps and gravity water systems, et cetera. came back to the east coast in the fall and resumed previous jobs plus working at a non-profit hunger advocacy project until recently. 

i was originally interested in doing an urban ag community education program alongside a production-scale urban garden, but have since decided i want to have my own farm and do a CSA.  i LOVE talking shop about permaculture, wwoofing, composting (i'm kinda crazy about composting), deep ecology/economics, so on.

Private companies are organizations of people created by voluntary arrangement to *collect money*. Providing goods is irrelevant to most US companies, and they only do it if they have to. If they can find an alternate means of collecting money, they do so.

Government does not exist to collect money. It exists to see that the goals set by those who hold power are achieved. In a democratic society, these goals would be those of the public at large. Collecting money is a means of achieving those goals.

Furthermore, you assume that *both* can't be the problem. Large private companies are able to buy influence with the government to use its power for their own ends.","1264986424"

""He was the president and founder of Northwest Exploration Company Limited and a director of its parent company, Northwest Explorations Inc. When Northwest Explorations Inc. was taken over in 1998 by CGX Resources Inc. to form the oil and gas exploration company CGX Energy Inc., McIntyre ceased being a director. McIntyre was a strategic advisor for CGX in 2000 through 2003.""

I'm sure he's not biased toward the petroleum industry in any way, seeing as he worked for them for 30 years or more.

Steps to recovery:

1) Insert Windows / Alternate OS disk

2) Partition drive so that you have 2 disks at least: one for your OS, drivers, and apps that absolutely won't install anywhere else but your system drive (if Windows, I'd say go with about 60GB), and one for everything else. The ""other"" disk can be either what's left over after creating your system disk, or you can split the ""left overs"" into multiple disks if you wish. I wouldn't get ridiculous though, personally. If you have plenty of space, create 120GB volumes, and use them for specific types of storage (e.g. one for your media, one for your porn, and maybe a hidden drive for your lgbt porn (google TrueCrypt)).

3) Install aforementioned OS and immediately do all updates. If using Windows, erase little-blue-e thing from desktop, quick-launch, and anywhere else you see it hiding. NOTE: Download one of the browsers mentioned in step 4 before erasing your means to visit web sites.

3a) Make certain to install drivers. You'll find them at HPs web site. You don't need ALL their software - just the drivers. Pick and choose what seems appropriate to you, and what you believe you'll actually use. If you're not going to use the ""Easy-Photo-Sharing-With-Friends-Family-And-The-Government"" utility, then don't install it.

4) Install FireFox, Chrome, or even Opera

5) Install an antivirus package like Kaspersky - if funds are low, settle for AVG - it's not bad at all. Certainly better than nothing.

6) Try Paint.NET. It's free, fun, easy-to-use, and offers many of the features found in PhotoShop.

7) Enjoy your PC, which probably runs half-again faster now thanks to your removal of all the pre-loaded software that runs everytime you start your computer up.

8) Be Thankful you have people who care enough to help you on Reddit. ;)","1264986515"

King of Kong - A man tries to set the new Donkey Kong high score and finds himself in an insane nerd sports movie. 

Man On Wire - One of the highest scoring films on Rotten Tomatoes ever. It's about the french high wire artist who walked between the Twin Towers in the mid seventies.

John Pilger's The New Rulers of The World- It's a documentary about politics and power, using indonesia as a case study. Powerful stuff.

Capturing the friedmans - What started off as a documentary about a kids party clown turned into a statling film as accusations of Child Pornography are levelled at the clowns father.

For example in my house we have the 20+ year old copper wiring. BT refuse to upgrade this on the ground of ""costs too much"". Now I'd feel some sympathy for them if they didn't charge more than twice as much as sky does. I pay 10 quid a month for unlimited broadband from Sky, BT wants 25. And to top this off, BT's routers are prone to breaking so I have to trudge through terrible (indian call centre) customer service and then wait a week just to get my internet back on. BT is a prime example of a Government service that should never have been privatised.

I also like the idea that some of the TV licence is used to pay for the network, since the iplayer is becoming one of the main parts of the BBC. It also allocates the damn funding, which is significant because projects like this are often ignored used as a one-time PR stunt.","1264986536"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I live in Grande Prairie, Alberta, which is about 8 hours driving distance from Calgary. A friend of mine named Chris lives in Calgary and we ran a small WedDesign company. I was going to go down there for the weekend to meet up, have drinks, and iron out a few details.


The Friday before, at my favorite bar in Grande Prairie - formerly called 'Sharks', and for whom I was designing a website at the time - I was getting drunk with the owner, who I assume was trying to impress me by letting me stay in the bar after closing. At about 3 a.m. two cute girls, who were also invited to stay after close, started dancing on the bar. I bought them some drinks, we chatted, exchanged names and a few stories, played a sloppy game of pool with them and the owner (the owner and I slaughtered them, but I think it was mostly about them leaning over the tables at that point). But I called it quits at 4 a.m. to get some rest before heading to Calgary. 

I woke up tired, late, sped to Calgary and made the eight hour trip in a six and a half hours. I showed up at Chris' place just in time for supper. He invited me in, but informed me that we were going to go out to dinner first to his favorite Calgary bar with some friends, and work would have to wait. 


Before I could comment, the two girls from Sharks in Grande Prairie the night before walked through his front door... we just stared at each other with stupid looks on our faces and said 'What the fuck?'.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I'm not sure that many people can claim a single event as being responsible for their depression, actually.  When trying to think through the causes, it seems that it can be too easy to attribute a certain major life event as the cause, even though a second person may have lived through the same sort of thing without depression as a result.  I think it's more likely that a unique mix of things that you have experienced when you are younger leave you more predisposed to having depression triggered by a larger event when it does happen (as things do - that much is inevitable).   In my (admittedly) limited experience, it seems when talking to people who feel deeply depressed that they've ""learned"" to be negative over a long period of time - to expect a negative outcome for example, and to internalise external events and link them to themselves in a way that is different to a non depressed person.  In other words, it's a type of ""world view"" that grows as you grow, and therefore seems normal and natural, and in fact may surprise you if you knew that other people feel differently. It's subtle and hard to notice if you try to analyse yourself.  It's easy to miss it and think that depression has just popped up out of nowhere.  It's why there are a lot of mental health professionals working with CBT these days - they know that changing your outlook and natural responses to a situation are important.  But it takes practice. There's a site called [moodgym](http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome) which might be of interest to you.

common sense.  really though if you can learn the pattern of files types and websites that are most likely infected you will be far ahead of the game.  stay away from any free software bundled up with any amount of adware/malware/browser toolbars and the like.
never download any executable you aren't positive that comes from legitimate sources - this goes for any fishy codecs too.
if you feel the need to get some AV any of the AV's listed will work just fine for average daily use.

most viruses i have encountered in the wild are bundled up in pirated software.  avoid pirating software and you will avoid most of the viruses.  there are free versions of just about everything anyway.  you can catch a nasty virus browsing pr0n - but thats probably because you are using IE.

switch browsers.  
the more a browser is used the more code there is out there trying to hack it.  firefox is better than ie, and opera may in this case be better than firefox (not in features but in safety) I personally use opera and SRwareIron(usb version) and have had zero problems.

watch out for any type of phishing scams.  just because you think you are logging into your bank doesn't mean you actually are.  in any case where you are submitting personal information make a habit of double checking the URL you have typed in.  this isn't AV necessarily but doesn't hurt to mention.

if its legit no problem. if the file is infect i run it on my laptop in a sandbox.
____________________________________________________________
if you run a 32 bit windows you are in luck.  run any shady program you might suspect to be malware including browsers (to keep the browser from infecting the rest of your computer) in a sandbox.  google ""sandboxie"" and get that. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

the next bit of advise is worth more than any amount of protection any company could possibly sell you.
BACK UP BACK UP AND BACK UP.
cd's / dvd's / external harddrives / online back up sites like dropbox and mozy.  use them.
case in point: my brothers ex wife had all kinds of toolbars on her browser and then one day it would only boot to a black screen.  safe mode didn't work either.  i had to remove the drive from the case - save all the pictures (6gigs+) - and reinstall vista.

So you danced close to the line, but didn't quite cross it?

No need to apologize that I feel the reference in your nickname is pretentious.  Why would you apologize?  Pretentious: intended to attract notice and impress others.  I by no means set out to place unneeded focus on your nickname, but used the opportunity to help illustrate my point.

You seem to think that by having me validate your assumption about my inclusion of the number ""420"" in my nickname will prove you right on some or all terms.  In my statement, I meant that your opinion about my marijuana use is a misconceived one.  That is, since your opinion seems to include the belief that I look like a ""complete tool"" because I tote ""420"" in my nickname, I can only assume that means you think marijuana users are of some lesser circle than you.  I didn't, however, mean to imply you were wrong that I use and like marijuana.  

I have no shame in expressing my interest for, and use of marijuana.  I do, however, pity you for what you've left me to believe is a seemingly misguided understanding of marijuana users.  Your (at the time) assumption that the 420 reference had to do with my marijuana use contributed to your opinion that I looked ""like a complete tool"" is, in my opinion, ill-founded and plain rude.

As a self-proclaimed patron of linguistics, you seem to lack the depth it takes to express your opinion without compensating with impudent slights, and believing that a ""but"" or a ""that being said"" gives you authority to.  Well done.","1264986642"

They had some weird deal where if you buy a pack of batteries and 2 proctor and gamble products, you get a $10 gift card. It turns out the batteries were like $4 and qualified products included .99 packs of soap and deodorant that was on clearance for 1.50. I went when it was not busy and found a worker that allowed me to do a ton a separate transactions. After a while the manager comes over and tries to put an end to it, even though I am completely following the rules of the promotion. This is fine with me as its his store and he has the right to do that, but then he decides to tell me I have to return all the merchandise I already paid for. I tell him that he is not allowed to force me to do this and that I would leave now if thats what he wants me to do. He decides to hide my merchandise and call the cops.  I call up my lawyer aunt and tell her whats going on. As soon as I get off the phone the manager says I'm not legally allowed to detain you. I tell him to give me my merchandise back and he does. As I am leaving the cops pull up and talk to me, trying to say how it is coupon fraud and all sorts of stuff, I told them the manager said I was fine to go and they let me leave. This was 4 years ago and I am still using the soap and deodorant I got from that. I only recently ran out of batteries, only because I kept giving them to people in my dorm.

I don't have my links on this machine -- don't ask.  but try a google for medical tourism costs.  In Mexico, I can get the exact cost for a procedure before I elect to go forward with the service.  Most of the countries that are seeking patients will do the same.  

Don't mistake high price for quality.  My wife had a cataract surgery done here in an OR that could have been in NYC given the quality of the equipment and, I expect that the staff were more solicitous.  $200 USD -- we have major medical that pick up the rest.  That costs us about $1,800 per year.  She has been 20:800 in this eye since birth and no US doc would touch this surgery because of the extreme correction required.  Now she is 20:35.  It was like a one-hour trip to Lourdes without the magic stuff.  

This same doc works for IMSS a version of national health insurance, if we had it performed under IMSS the cost would have been $0.  The annual premium would be about $300 USD.  We don't use IMSS for ethical reasons, I don't want to divert scarce resources that I can afford away from people who only have this option.  But the gov here would let me enroll anytime, complete a 2 year waiting period for pre-existing and then everything including meds would be covered under my annual fee.

Just be discreet and don't attract unnecessary attention. Just blend in and walk around like you own the place, as if everything's normal. If you're all shifty eyed and nervous when you go to the bathroom, then people will pick up on those nonverbal cues and be suspicious.","1264986796"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hm. My dad bought one of the big satellite dish TV setups back in the late 80s. He then wired all the TVs in the house so you could set the big dish to a channel then watch it in another room (this was before remotes that worked through walls). Shortly after this he paid the guy he bought the setup from and extra $1k for an illegal chip that essentially made the receiver descramble everything. PPV, porn, all the pay cable channels (HBO, cinemax, showtime), etc.

My dad was a porn freak, my parents would leave for work at 11pm and he'd pop in a VCR tape and record porn all morning long while they were gone. When he wired all the TVs together he put a series of switches on a board so he could shut off the satellite to that room, switching it back to antenna. 


Well one night he set up his porn recording and didn't switch off my room, and I always fell asleep with the TV on. I woke up in the middle of the night to see this haggardly-looking white chick sucking the longest, scariest purple pecker that took up most of my 19"" TV screen. 

**That** movie disturbed the hell out of me, I was half-asleep, so it must have imprinted undesirable images in my brain, because I remember having nightmares of the purple penis man while growing up, with penises sticking out **FROM EVERYWHERE** chasing me. holy fuck, I was only 11.

One of his arguments against CSP is this:

&gt;If you try to pawn off something as Counter-Strike, it had better be Counter-Strike. Its fans are die-hard and extremely picky. Minor details, such as netcode feel, movement, bullet spread, recoil, map idiosyncrasies, will get torn to shreds if they differ in any way. Counter-Strike’s simple consistency is important to professional players, and even if your game is playable, if it doesn’t have those aspects, they won’t like it.

CS:S is even more different from CS 1.6 in terms of netcode, movement, bullet spread, recoil, and maps, yet people still play it competitively.  His argument that CSP won't be played competitively because it isn't exactly CS 1.6 falls to the ground: CS:S has proved that people will play something labeled as the next CS, even if it differs from CS 1.6","1264986807"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Not being able to lie doesn't mean that you have to volunteer  embarrassing or awkward sentiments. It's good for a laugh at first, but when you think about it, things don't work like that. People are perfectly capable of self-censorship; they realize that some information is not necessary to communicate and can do more harm than good. There's no need for guile when someone isn't asking you for certain information in the first place.

It would probably have been much better as a sketch comedy vignette. Because I don't see how the society depicted in the film could actually function. For example, there's the scene with the cop, which, while funny, accidentally breaks the premise of the film.

He openly admits to taking bribes and experiencing sexual arousal by arresting people, but he's apparently never disciplined or fired? How could he so freely hand out that information, but no one ever passes that info on to his superiors, or the press, or his peers?

If it's supposed to be a riff on how cops can get away with anything... then why isn't bribery seen as dishonesty? The cop is presumably representing himself as a stand-up member of law enforcement to the public and to his peers, while revealing himself as corrupt when he asks for a bribe. Furthermore, the very act of offering a bribe is dishonesty, because you're asking the cop to pretend that the crime never took place. And it's occurring to you that such deception is possible to begin with. It occurred to Gervais' character because he knew about deception, but it was obviously a popular arrangement for the cop.

The world depicted in the movie doesn't have a coherent internal logic, which is necessary when depicting a world with fantasy rules, even when it's ""just a comedy.""","1264986833"

Two big reasons why starving families have more children are to have more labor on their farm and to increase the chances of one of their children surviving into adulthood. In many of the societies where starvation is prevalent, children typically take care of their parents when the children reach adulthood. It makes sense for parents to have more kids in these societies in an attempt to get more work done and to try and ensure a better future. When food supplies become more certain and future survival isn't totally up in the air, then people respond by investing more resources into smaller numbers of children. It's also very difficult to make universal claims about human nature. Many of the traits that we suppose to be universal are really cultural constructions that are only universal within certain paradigms.

Also, it's very difficult to empower women, or anyone for that matter, to get educated in subsistence scenarios. You can't just claim that educating women will solve everything. A stable food supply is necessary to attain this goal. Note: I'm not saying that education of women isn't important; it's vitally important. However, that's not the end-all solution.

One friend steps outside to have a smoke and while he is gone the hot german waitress gets more drink orders from us, so we order him a boot full of beer.   

He is taking his sweet time outside talking to some girl so we all pass his boot around the table, and we're doing toasts with it and banging it on the table and pretty much being rowdy.   The friend comes back in (he was way more sober than us) and sortof sighs when he finds out he's got at least a liter of beer in front of him, but he's game.   He picks up the boot, takes a single sip, sets it gently on the table and *kerblam* the entire bottom blows out of the boot.

The bar people were furious at him, despite his protestations.  They made him pony up $45 for the boot (which we all pitched in for) but they said he could never have a boot in the restaurant again.

(Later we were at another german restaurants and ordering boots and I had the manager come out and tell him that they couldn't give him a boot, that his name was on the boot breaker registry and they had his picture and they were very sorry but he could have several pint glasses.

This is a good example of my argument that 99.9% of Christians don't really believe.

If it truly was ""God's will"" then he wouldn't undergo a dangerous, invasive medical procedure that is undoubtedly an attempt to undermine God's plan in the first place.  Brain surgery is certainly not based on divine inspiration.  It's based on secular medical technology.  So a pastor who talks about ""God's will"" and then tries to undermine it in his own personal life, is a hypocrite in my book.  

That notwithstanding, I wish the guy well, but I suspect he has one additional problem that us atheists don't: the added stress of trying to reconcile his dogmatic belief system with the reality of his predicament.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I think it's more like this: We can pretty accurately predict the way a rubber ball will react to its surroundings. There are plenty of calculations we can do to see how far it will roll after being launched down a ramp, or where it will land on the third bounce after being thrown at a certain speed, or even how much it will compress on each bounce. It's because our minds, limited as they are, have (or can have) a complete understanding of the nature of a rubber ball.

Likewise, God has a complete knowledge of each and every one of us. God knows whether we'll eat a hamburger on a day when the humidity is a certain point, the temperature is whatever it is, our particular mood at that moment is whatever it is, and the time since our last hamburger is whatever else. Maybe he can accurately predict what we're going to do in that node tree you're talking about? I'd bet it's like predicting with 100% accuracy. Given that we had complete (and I mean TOTALLY complete) knowledge of a person, conscious and sub-conscious, etc. I think people, or at least a really good game theorist could plot out a person's decisions, etc. But it takes an intellectual capacity far greater than anything we could ever be or make to do that. It's not that we're simple and easy to understand, it's just that we're of finite complexity, while God's intelligence is infinite.

&gt;I do think that there is plenty of room for debate over whether a specific cap &amp; trade bill would have a meaningful impact on the problem.

Excellent, given that all sides can agree that there is a problem and that anything can be done about it if there is.  Given that both conditions must be true in order to proceed, it can be demonstrated that there's enough reason to believe that one or neither condition may be true, hence no 'progress' in either direction.

&gt;But to argue that CO2 emissions are not causing the planet to warm is ridiculous in my opinion.

This oversimplifies the question.  Yes, CO2 causes warming.  That's a simple, reproducible scientific fact.  What *else* must occur in order for it to be a *problem*?  First, it must have demonstrated negative effects which everyone can agree upon.  With Al Gore and the AGW yahoos running around like chicken littles telling us that the sky is falling and that the oceans are going to rise in tens of *feet* (they won't, by *anyone's* estimation except Mr. Gore's), that polar bears are going to drown (they won't, again, in anyone's estimation except Mr. Gore's) or even go extinct (Polar Bears survived in prehistoric times during periods where temperatures were much higher than they are now - they're adaptive enough to move to more southern climes), the hysterics become pretty hard to take seriously.  We also must assume that this relationship is more than a linear relationship, which is a *huge* point of contention between skeptics and others.  In order to achieve the numbers which would actually be *alarming*, the temperature imbalance caused by CO2 alone must be greater than that which is demonstrated by simple physics - it must be create *imbalance* in the climate system, which is something which has *never* been demonstrated experimentally.  It is very possible that climate is far more stable than we give it credit for and that there are net negative sinks in the entire system which nullify the effect CO2 has on it.  That is a fair supposition, and one which is unclear (despite the claims of consensus).

&gt;There are not ""two sides"" to this element of the debate -- there's just about every scientist who has studied the problem, vs. a handful of fringe investigators

The opinion polls of scientists which ask if Global Warming is real are biased in favor of the answer being the one that alarmists seek.  If you merely ask if increased CO2 creates a greater temperature, the only correct answer is yes (by physics), and not under contention by anyone (which is why the polls are so close to 100%).  A more accurate question is:  Will it create an alarming amount of warming - enough that something must be done about it by humankind lest drastic consequences occur?  That question would almost certainly yield much lower numbers of 'yes' responses - though pollsters don't want to ask questions like that.  The number of scientists who would align with Al Gore's ridiculous claims would be actually quite low, especially if they are educated on the subject.

'Denying' Gore's brand of alarmism is the only appropriate course, given how fundamentally unsound it is [[one source]](http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckton/goreerrors.html).  There's *plenty* of room for argument within the scientific community about the hypothesis that climate is a system made unstable by a given amount of CO2.

&gt;vs. a handful of fringe investigators funded by the oil &amp; gas industry, like former TV weatherman Anthony Watts.

This is untrue, in addition to being merely an ad hominem smear.  Agree or disagree with the points Mr. Watts brings up, not with where he does or does not get his funding.","1264986971"

For instance looking at this [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VHT-4G5B11J-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2005&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1187794211&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=667d2667b0347764a13c1efdc3866a0b). Specifically this [table](http://imgur.com/JQOgL.jpg). I'm also not going to lie, it's infuriating to see people just toss statistics off without looking at the research behind them. 

Essentially the table says the chance of a male being sexually abused is about 1 in 6 and for a female it's in-between 1 in 4 and 1 in 5. Then if you break the types down, most of the discrepancy arises from females being more likely to be touched in a sexual way as a child, then males. But that when you look at the more serious forms of sexual abuse, the percentages are actually equivalent. 

What I think is interesting is how all of these issues stem from the same predefined notions of gender roles. Kloo2yoo often seems very quick to defend males and point out how they could be in the right, but often ignores many women's issues. Yet it's all the same problem, gender roles. Men are supposed to be tough and hard-working bread-winners, capable of enduring much hardship as Tony Soprano would put it the strong silent type. Woman are seen as weaker than men, better at raising children in need of a man generally. While these archetypes are being broken down, they're less prevalent than they used to be. Still the majority of things the men's right movement will push for, are because of these gender roles. Men's rape isn't seen to be a big deal, because men should be able to handle it and get over. There's not a well-defined conversation for what a man does if he's abused, the conversation in masculine terms is, you get over it. Women on the other-hand can have other problems, similarly because of their supposed roles as temptresses. Further more the men's right movements is often yelling about the injustices of the court system in custody cases, once again gender roles. Women are seen as nurtures and better parents, I.E. better fit to raise a child than a male. 

In order to solve these problems, we have to forget about gender roles. The only way to fix these problems, is not to fixate on what a man should be, or a woman should be, but what a person should be. ","1264987070"

girl: Gawd, my boyfriend is such a dick.

me: Why don't you break it off?

girl: \*shocked/concerned\* Because I love him, you know?

me: Not really, explain.

girl: Well... he does this and that and it's cute. :D

me: What did he do that you're so angry?

girl: \*exasperated\* He's just so... blah blah blah all the time and blah blah blah sensitivity.  (more talking)

me: Yeah, I really don't care.  I'm going to look over here now.  

friend: Dude... 

me: What's she want me to do about it? It's her decision. I don't even know the guy. 

Obviously I don't have conversations like that anymore.  Women don't bitch about their boyfriends to random guys at this age either.  If they have boyfriends they usually don't let you know (oooh mystery) or let you know right away that they do.  I totally understand that this girl was looking for someone to confide in.

My entire adolescence, any time I would have a nightmare, Chucky was right there chasing me. One time I was running away from a girl who LOOKED like Chucky. 

Here's the weird part; when I was probably about 13, I had a dream where I walked into a warehouse and quietly made my way toward the middle. I kept behind the aisles so I could stay out of sight, where I saw a giant cage (meant for a great big bird), with Chucky sitting perched, just out of the light so you could only see his feet. He was laughing maniacally, too. People would walk up to him crying and screaming, asking why he killed them--all with some sort of weapon lodged into their body. The one I most remember was an asian chick with an axe coming out of her head. 

So yeah. I'm too afraid to watch any Child's Play movie these days, even being 23. Was he locked in any sort of bird cage in the movie, too?","1264987175"

If a company starts abusing its place in the market, what's to stop a newcomer from taking their place by offering better goods at cheaper prices, *besides the use of violence*?

&gt; In a democratic society, these goals would be those of the public at large. Collecting money is a means of achieving those goals.

So the 52% of federal tax money (in the US) that goes to military expenses is a reflection of the public will?

&gt; Furthermore, you assume that both can't be the problem. Large private companies are able to buy influence with the government to use its power for their own ends.

I don't assume that, I arrive at that conclusion.  Large companies cannot buy power from a government that doesn't exist, and large companies cannot exclude other companies from the market without the threat of violence.","1264987176"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I remember reading a book (book is in storage, sorry) about the history of the guys who worked at some airbase on the border between CO and UT who were working with the cases for the thin-man and fat-man cases. Some of the thin-man prototype tests involved putting a shell in the ""gun"" barrel inside the prototype, then dropping the whole assembly from an aircraft into a hillside, digging it out, then measuring how far the projectile moved in the barrel. I remember it being like a foot or less.

There have been a number of accidents where H-bombs fall out of airplanes (the plane is on fire, collided with something else, whatever), and none of them have gone off. So I'm not worried about them going off by accident at all - because a lot of smart guys have gone out of their way to make sure it doesn't happen again. What worries me is that some dufus will screw up (again) and put another set of live warheads on a B-52 pylon and they'll end up getting sold to some scrap dealer ""by accident."" 

Part of what PALs do is to sense that they're in the proper environment for their intended mission. So a warhead off an ICBM could not be fiddled with to blow up on the ground, it would first have to undergo several Gs of acceleration, followed by zero-G before the arming mechanism would recognize it is time to arm. Or a bomb would have altimeters to measure how high it got, and free-fall sensors to detect it had been dropped. A bunch of stuff like that so your bombs don't go all Dark Star on you.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","1. You have to consider the carbon that was released in the production of the plastic in the first place. Just because some of it is locked up in the plastic, much more of it was locked up a couple miles down before we taped into the crude that was used to make it. Refineries release carbon as well as tons of other potentially harmful chemicals.
2. Not true. Some of it blows away from the landfill, especially light plastics like bags. Some of it is lost from the trucks that transport it to the landfill. Much of this lost plastic makes it's ways into rivers and eventually the ocean. Check out the article I linked.
3. UV is only one thing that causes release of chemicals. Simply sitting in the ground is another. For example, BPA leaches into the contents of plastic bottles while simply sitting on the shelves. Another is PVC which releases DINP, DEHP, and dioxins (known cancer causing agents) into ground water as it sits in landfills.

&gt;UV degeneration should not happen

Should being the key word. Visit a landfill. Take note of the amount of unburied or exposed plastics littering the surface.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Let us finally consider how naive it is altogether to say: ""Man ought to be such and such!"" Reality shows us an enchanting wealth of types, the abundance of a lavish play and change of forms — and some wretched loafer of a moralist comments: ""No! Man ought to be different."" He even knows what man should be like, this wretched bigot and prig: he paints himself on the wall and comments, ""Ecce homo!"" But even when the moralist addresses himself only to the single human being and says to him, ""You ought to be such and such!"" he does not cease to make himself ridiculous. The single human being is a piece of fatum from the front and from the rear, one law more, one necessity more for all that is yet to come and to be. To say to him, ""Change yourself!"" is to demand that everything be changed, even retroactively. And indeed there have been consistent moralists who wanted man to be different, that is, virtuous — they wanted him remade in their own image, as a prig: to that end, they negated the world! No small madness! No modest kind of immodesty!

Really? God sat back for 3.5 billion years as life developed , watched for hundreds of thousands of years as a particularly smart ape appeared, then decided to magically give this ape a soul, and whisk him off to eternal life after he dies?

Humans are animals, made of the same stuff - but when did the soul get put in? Why did God choose to reveal himself to primitive people in the middle east (doing all kinds of magic, and being very similar to other religions around the world) then hide from all attempts to measure him?

I'd say it takes more mental self-deception to believe religion and science can coexist than creationism, which hilarious as it is, is at least self-consistent.

I can't find much wrong with that, gay rights for instance requires granting rights to a whole class of people. And certainly granting women rights, as a class of people, was important during the early part of the 20th century, to balance historical lack of rights. 

At any rate, how many people took women's studies in college? I can't think of a single one of my friends, male or female, who did. Rants like that are stupid, they assume that institutions require students to take women's studies courses or that women's studies material leaks over into every other aspect of college life (untrue). 

How many of you ever encounter 'radical feminists' in real life ? I think I've met one, honestly...and I went to a really liberal college. You guys are in danger of conflating internet rhetoric with reality, which can lead to really bitter attitudes (like being a black dude who looks at stormfront all day).  I'll start worrying about radical feminism when I actually start encountering it

Some focused counseling on the front end is hugely useful but seldom done.   Both I and my son did the [AIMS program](http://www.aimstesting.org/) in Dallas and found it extremely valuable.  The recommendations are very specific - they are not afraid to tell you if they don't think a career you are thinking about is a good match for you.  They are also pragmatic - .i.e. ""You would be good at X, Y, or Z but you/anyone will find it difficult to make a living at X so we recommend Y or Z.""

We all have a certain set of aptitudes or talents.   What the science is saying is that those aptitudes are essentially fixed.   Interests change but your aptitudes do not.   That doesn't mean that something is necessarily impossible for you if you really are interested but if you don't have the aptitude it will be more difficult for you than it will be for someone who does.

I felt it was a bit more believable that the deities could be proven to exist in the evidence of their power and of the existence of their ""agents"", but that they exist at a scope that makes personal intervention almost completely unheard of.

"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","&gt;I can't believe you can be this stupid.

Yes, I'm stupid because you disagree with me.  I've heard that before.

All your argument is, is a wordy red herring peppered with a bunch of name dropping and irrelevant references.

I've said it before.. all you have are *theories*.  You have nothing in practice.  You're going to use Somalia as an example of private property rights in action working for the betterment of society?   Are you fucking kidding me?  You think Somalia is a model society?  Oh no?  Yea, that's because you're picking-and-choosing tiny examples out of context to desperately try and prove your point.  It's the same circular argument, over and over.  I'm sorry, but I grow tired of it.  

Call me an idiot all you want.  The bottom line is you have nothing but a theory of how the whole world should work.  I'd love to know what your area of expertise is in which makes your opinion so superior to mine?  Do you have a degree in economics?  Have you done any significant work in politics beyond slapping a ""Ron Paul"" bumper sticker on a street pole in the middle of the night?

&gt;Yes, the sea, which is a commons and not private property has failed because that's free market capitalism. 

Yes, everything would work if we divided the sea up into little plots of private territory....  good fucking grief...

&gt;I made a reference to Coase's theorem 

Coase's theorm is another red herring.  It doesn't take into account the real world likelihood of powerful private interests infringing upon other peoples' property rights with little or no liability.  It also assume that agreements between parties can be fairly mediated, another obvious fantasy in our present day system.  

Put down the pipe.  Take your head out of those deep wells of academic circle jerks and look around at the real world.  All those theoretical ideas about how a perfect balance could theoretically be made sounds nice in *theory* but **does not work** in practice.  The world is much more complicated than people like Coase envisioned.

Best part of your reference is the original author admitted his theory was totally impractical in the first place:

&gt;*Ronald Coase himself asserts that it would be unrealistic to assume there were no costs in the conduction of market transactions, and that these costs are ""often extremely costly, sufficiently costly at any rate to prevent many transactions that would be carried out in a world in which the pricing system worked without cost*

So thank you for proving my point.  Your ideas are *totally theoretical* and not practical.

Does that mean they are poor? No. If I say that the way you speak or something in your name makes you seem like a tool that doesn't mean you are a tool or that I am calling you a tool. If you said that my name makes it seem like I am pretentious I would have no problem with that. You would be right. To some, my name might make me seem pretentious. Does that mean I am? No. Does that mean you called me pretentious? No.

I don't need the definition of pretentious. I didn't chose this nickname to impress anyone. Again, I chose this nickname because I have a passion for linguistics. Would chosing the name Rash because I like the game Battletoads be pretentious? Would picking the name of my favorite band be pretentious?

I said I was sorry because I feel sorry that you feel the reference in my name is pretentious. You are entitled to that opinion though.

I don't think having you validate the inclusion of 420 in your name will prove me right on any term. I didn't make any assumption about your marijuana use. You seem to have a habit of thinking I said things that I never did. I don't think marijuana users are of a lesser circle than me. I have nothing against marijuana use. Again, you are assuming things that are incorrect.

What I did say is that using 420 in your name makes you seem like a tool. Where does that say that you use marijuana? Where does that say I think marijuana users are of a lesser circle? All that says it that in my opinion the use of 420 in an online alias makes someone seem like a tool. Nothing more, nothing less. It has nothing to do with if that person actually uses marijuana or not. I have no misunderstanding of marijuana users. I again never made any reference to you being or not being a marijuana user.

You really need to go back and read the things that I actually wrote and stop making assumptions about what I may or may not think. The words are right there. You don't need to assume what I think because I wrote what I think clearly.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; the origin of kare and kanojo is not relevant. (But it is interesting... do you have a citation for that?)

It's relevant in that it shows that the words lack one of the distinguishing properties of pronouns, namely that they're syntactic constructs that tend to survive in the language longer than ordinary nouns.

If you read Japanese, [here's a source](http://www.seg.co.jp/cgi-bin/kb7.cgi?b=sss-learning&amp;c=e&amp;id=514) for the origins of *kare* and *kanojo*. It says that *kare* existed, but its meaning was changed to use it as a translation for ""he"" (転用後), while *kanojo* was created as a translation of ""she"" (新造語) (by tacking the kanji for ""woman"" onto the end of *kare*). 
 
&gt; They're called pronouns because they fill some of the same semantic functions as pronouns in other language families.

Right, but pronouns are syntactic constructs.

&gt; I mean, you just made that term up, because you disagree with the utility of applying the term ""pronoun"" here, right?

I didn't make up the term ""pseudo-pronoun"" (unless my mind is going worse than I thought), but a more common term might be ""anaphoric noun.""

The main problem is that if you go into Japanese looking for ""pronouns,"" you'll find them. Oh, here's the translation of ""he,"" here's the translation of ""she,"" here's the translation of ""I"" (oops, do I use watakushi, watashi, ore, boku, uchi, jibun, shousei... not very pronoun-like, but never mind) and so on, and then you're off to the next language without hanging around long enough for the Japanese experts to say, ""Hold on a second there...""

You seem to put forward that notion that mathematics is *discovered* rather than *adapted* to match observed phenomena. Remember, Mathematics is just a language *developed by humans*. 

You seem to be touching on rejecting the anthropomorphic view of the universe. People tend to think that the universe is *special* because it houses life such as our own. The fact that we exist means that there exists a universe that we can exist in. If we consider Brane theory, then it is possible the universes exist with different fundamental forces. If they do exist, then it makes sense to think of it as an evolutionary process in which a universe that can host life as we know it has arisen. This universe is likely no more special than any other universe, when considered at the scale of multiple universes.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not me, but a friend.

He had just split up with his long time girlfriend and decided to take advantage of one of the crushes a girl at work had been maintaining on him for a while.  So he dated her a couple times, eventually brought her back home, and started doing the deed.  Being a smart guy, he wrapped up and enjoyed himself.  After a bit, he thinks ""This feels... different.""  He pulls out and suddenly is no longer wearing a condom.

He points this out to the girl.  She responds with a giggle and says ""Keep going.  You can just cum on my butt.""  (When I heard this story the next day, I exploded in laughter at that comment.)

My buddy was not having that shit.  His first thought *should* have been ""Put another on and finish this thing.""  For some reason, scientific curiosity got the best of him and his first thought was instead ""Where the fuck did that other condom go?""

So he told her that he was a little weirded out and couldn't finish.  She was disappointed but accepted that.  They embarked on the search for the missing condom.  They tore sheets off the beds, pulled the mattress away from the wall, dug through piles of laundry... there was no condom to be found.  She seemed unconcerned: ""Oh, I'm sure it's just somewhere we haven't looked.""  My buddy tentatively agreed, fell asleep, and took her home in the morning.

When he got back, he *ravaged* his fucking bedroom.  He looked absolutely everywhere.  There was only one place that condom could have been.  He was sure of it.  Most things end up wherever you put them last, after all.

The whole situation freaked him out and he never went out with her again.  In fact, he never brought it up with her again.  To this day, we still have no idea if she ever found it.  I assume she would have eventually noticed.  I *hope* she had the thought herself the next day and performed her own independent search.  The world will never know.

**TLDR:** A chick's vagina ate my buddy's condom.

---

Edit: Oh yeah, I have another friend who broke a girl's neck while doing her doggy style.  She was pressed up against the headboard and he was just pounding away.  All the sudden, she goes limp on the bed.  He freaks the fuck out.  She was still conscious and still could move, but was in a huge amount of pain.  They called the ambulance, went to the hospital, and she ended up in a neck brace for a while after that.","1264987790"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I haven't seen anything that hollywood or disney had made to be historical accurate. Today Greek mythology is mostly located during the classical Greece while the stories before that which were the original inspiration for clasical Greece tales and the stories that came after classical Greece are totally neglected. Roman people were slowly transformed to Italian,French, Spanish etc. As for Rome taking all it's culture from Greece is not entire true as there was a common Greco-Roman period that had cultural infuence from Rome, Greece and other parts of the empire most of them eastern. That was until they split to Western and Eastern Roman Empire and all of these are left out from modern stories. Disney is messing all these up into one story showing legends from different time periods into one story. Taking a very good story and making it hollywood size is just wrong.","1264987792"

the word ""[Shinto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shintoo)"" literally means ""Way of the Gods"". you are hopelessly confused yet again. the japanese are some of the most spiritual peoples on earth.



&gt; and also there are many holy traditions and rules in soccer. for example, you have to wear the same costume as your teammate, you cannot use your hand to score a goal, you have to use soccer shoes, not other shoes like tennis shoes or boots, etc.

really? you're equating the rules and regulations of a professional sport with religious texts? haha, next thing you know, you're claiming soccer referees are the priests of soccer. preposterous, and absolute heresy. comedy gold!



&gt; all the rules and traditions are so holy, come directly from God of Soccer, He who created and ordered the men to play the sport.

yeah, that's something someone living in a mental institution would say



&gt;and yet, He doesn't allow any country to exclusively play the game. He distribute the enjoyment all around the world. He even show mercy if Thou cannot obey all the rules.

maybe this god of soccer is friends with santa claus. during christmas, they distribute gifts and the enjoyment of soccer all around the world while riding a sleigh powered by reindeer and magical faerie dust. that's totally not insane, right?","1264987886"

They told her that her mom had died just after childbirth and that was the end of it. Two weeks ago they told her that her mother was getting out of prison in August and that she really has a mother.

So I have a couple of questions: 
Did your family and mother cover it up or was it just never brought up?

Each pro/con should also have it's own comment page so people can write what they think about it.

really what i'd want this to be is a way to get condensed points to the voter so that they may become more informed when making their decisions, I don't think we really have to worry about uninformed voters right now (this community is pretty intelligent) but when we get out into the main stream, we really do have to deal with this and help educate voters in the most unbiased way we can.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I totally agree with you. While this charlesbarkley dude is right about compound lifts, he seems to have a extreme case of tunnel vision.

Compound lifts, put simply, are the lifts that call upon multiple muscle groups for effort and stabilization. They're far more effective compared to isolation lifts, which you'll usually see being done on machines or free weights.

Some examples of compound lifts: Pull Ups, Dips, Squats, Deadlifts and Rows. 

Some examples of isolation lifts: Bicep curls, calf raises, hamstring curls, tricep extensions. 

While it is true that you will get the best results if you stick with compound lifts, form is extremely important, as they're easier to mess up which sometimes can lead to injury. 

Me, I do both compound lifting and yoga. I like the way Yoga feels, so I do it. As far as body composition though, my compound lifting has done far more for me. 

Best of luck!

PS. The whole idea of wanting to ""tone"" is kind of outdated. You don't need to be afraid of getting ""bulked"" from lifting, which honestly is impossible for most people without a dedicated diet, consistent heavy lifting and about 6-12 months. So I guess my point is, lift for strength, challenge yourself and you'll get far better results than slinging a 10 lb dumbbell around. ","1264987992"

I shot a bird in mid-flight in my backyard.   One shot, boom, fell right out of the sky.  I felt intensely bad.   It was flying almost directly overhead and only about 20 feet up so not that terribly difficult of a shot.

Then a few years later a pal and I are having a 'bb gun war' at the beach and I see a duck bobbing out on the water about 50 feet or so.   I take a pot shot at it thinking that at the very most it's going to squawk and fly away if I hit it.  It's far enough away that the ocean swells are completely hiding it half the time so I really didn't think I would hit it at all.

Of COURSE I hit it, and it does squawk but instead of flying away it just starts bobbing.

It slowly wafts in with the tide and there it is, on the beach, just twitching.   Somehow I hit the motherfucker in a nerve or something and it's not dead, just twitching and flapping a wing.    I discuss it with my friend and we decide we have to put it out of it's misery, so I try to shoot it in the head.   Doesn't die.   I put 5 fucking pellets into that things head at point blank (10 pumps) before it died.   Buried it in a shallow grave on the beach.

That was the last time I ever pointed any kind of gun at anything, and I've never knowingly killed another animal without eating it since.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I'm more of a centrist (with many center-left and center-right policies), so I disagree with both sides in general. However I think the Left's policies, primarily of the Liberals, has been exacerbating problems both on a national scale for countries and on a global scale.

Multiculturalism is a naive, unscientific, and illogical ideology that ignores basic biology, genetics and anthropology; it creates more racial tensions and destroys genetics, cultures and languages. If someone wants 'multiculturalism' then they should look at our planet, we already are a multicultural species; cooperation between different races, ethnicities and cultures has been increasing as more and more countries become developed. We don't need multiculturalism in our countries, we need to preserve all our unique peoples, their cultures and their languages; we are entirely capable of living together and cooperating as a species on a planetary and interplanetary level. I also see it as necessary, as we may encounter an extraterrestrial species one day; if we don't encounter any, we still will have to deal with the guaranteed differences in our species (like on Earth) that will arise from the separation issues that come from colonizing new planets and star systems.

I attribute most of the world's poverty to the Liberal governments over the last half century providing welfare to poor countries, and the occasional meddling in politics due to rampant Corporatism in attempts to exploit natural resources in their countries. The welfare just exacerbates their problems as they have no incentive to become self-sufficient, and they have a lot more children while there is a constant supply of free food, which just makes the entire situation worse and worse as the aid will just increase to compensate. We should be providing knowledge and training, and perhaps giving equipment/animals/plants out on loan so that people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps, so to speak. This will also help those people develop pride in what they've accomplished, helping them in the long run.","1264988032"

Just off the top of my head:

* Do you have a way to get IPv6 connectivity? Most people are relying on tunnels right now and it can be a bit of a chore to set up if you're not familiar with networking. Setting up a tunnel to one machine is much easier, though, than setting up an entire internal network. Server 2008+ has an ISATAP interface that will automatically attempt to establish a tunnel, but I haven't ever seen it work properly. 

* Putting a quad-a record in DNS for your host can cause you some grief. Most newer OSs default to v6 if they have a public address, but people that have a v6 IP address don't necessarily have a route to your host via v6. This is the reason that Google currently doesn't have quad-a records available to the general public.

In the end, I think if you're willing to invest the time into running IPv6 it's definitely worth it and it will be valuable experience in the long run. ","1264988038"

Reference ICCDBB Note for Romans 12.3 for differently worded math proof, perhaps more clear for you, reader, involving faith and logic.), and G=God: Keeping within norms of logical mathematical progression to solve a problem, since S is known, reasonably we assign 100% to S, and to T we can assign 0% (to disprove) or 100% (to prove), then 100%/0%=X (beyond the scope of Relativity, hence the need for Absolutivity, see below. No affiliation with any other using the generic root word absolute, unless otherwise stated by ICCDBB.), nondivisible, hence the proof of non-existence is not concluded per that rationale, yet if we assign 100% to S and 100% to T then 100%/100%=100% (Note: it was found not everybody understood the higher math meaning so this previous paragraph was updated 9/16/2006: the original meaning as explained in ICCDBB sermons is that if you for instance you have a handful of water, it is 100% of the water you have, even though it might be 1% as much compared to another amount of water, and yet together whether considered 101% or 100%, relativity has chosen to the extent of relativity's ability.) or

Or gluttony. Taken literally, gluttony (as one of the seven deadly sins) says that you should not eat any more than is necessary to stay alive. Fuck that! I love food! It's a sin if you eat to the point that you're full, because you've eaten more than was necessary for you to survive, and thus taking food away from people who actually need it. It's a sin. To be stuffed. Oh, and sloth. Another one of the deadly sins. Want to be lazy in the morning? Want to hit that ""Snooze"" button on your clock so you can sleep just a little bit longer? You fucking sinner! And my last example (though there are more), pride. If you make something amazing, you're proud of it, right? So proud that you want to show others and get recognition for what a great job you've done? Sure you do, it's human nature to be proud of things. Which is exactly why it's a deadly sin. If you're a hardcore, take-everything-literally Christian, then pride even goes as far as labels on your clothing. If you like Aropostale (or however the hell it's spelled) clothing because of the brand more than anything, or you want to ""fit in"" by wearing those clothes...

Well, her turds (sinkers) had clogged the toilet. 

I could have just walked out, but I opened a closet, and found an old plunger. I plunged for a little while. The plunger suction cup got inverted, I grabbed some TP, held the plunger, and corrected it. After 3 minutes of fighting, I had the toilet cleared. Peed, and spend another three minutes scrubbing my hands and headed out.

In fact, you're quite right to say that what I did wasn't entirely original. *I* was simply pointing out that *because* we're in a subreddit dedicated to a meme, crying about lack of originality is a strange thing to do, though I can understand the desire for more original permutations of said meme.

Still, if you'd like to talk logic, we can do that. 

From your original post:

**""Oh look at me I am in my 20s and hate conservatives.""**

You assume that I am in my twenties and hate conservatives based upon a joke I posted to Reddit. This is an idiotic premise for your non-argument.

**""This makes me the most original person that ever lived.""**

You assume that because of my hate of conservatives and being in my twenties, I consider myself the most original person in history. This is an idiotic non sequitur.

**""Strange how non-conformists always think alike.""**

You assume that I am a non-conformist (without properly defining what a non-conformist is in this context), and that all non-conformists think alike. This is an idiotic, baseless, and pointless statement.

From your second post, let me re-state what happened.

+ You made statements X, Y, and Z (where X was an idiotic ad hominem attack, Y was a baseless non sequitur, and Z was a meaningless, sarcastic conclusion).

+ I point out that within our current context, your only valid thesis (that my work is unoriginal) is mostly irrelevant.

+ Therefore, though technically right, you're a moron.

As potential catastrophe looms, more and more money and resources will be put into research and development of new technologies to push that catastrophe back.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It blows me away that reddit as a whole has so much trouble understanding this.

The Republicans fucked up bad recently (Bush years).  Really bad.  The Democrats recognized this and used it to amass an overwhelming amount of public support and political power (House, Senate and Presidency).  So far, so good.

In keeping with the 'we're not Republicans' strategy, the Democrats drummed up support for their health-care bill by saying ""We're going to pass this bill with or without Republican support!""  And the crowed went wild.

Here's the problem though:  The Democrats don't want to pass this bill without Republican support.  If the Republicans don't give it any support, and it fails, then the Democrats are essentially done for the next decade or so.  The blame for the massive collapse will fall in their collective lap, and the Republicans will only have to utter 'Obamacare' to defeat any Democratic momentum.

The Democrats figured that they could get at least *one* Republican to vote for the health care bill, so they essentially figured they had it in the bag.  That's why they were so confident in the beginning about not needing Republican support and about passing the bill no matter what.

The Democrats told the Republicans ""We're passing this bill with or without you.""

The Republicans said ""Bring it.""

The Democrats said ""...fuck.""

The Republicans knew that the Democrats would not pass a bill without some bipartisan support.  The Democrats didn't think they did.  That's what's causing this whole problem.

Now, the Republicans can just sit back and say ""No"" to everything and the Democrats are going to buckle every time.  That's why we went from universal to public option to mandated insurance with no pre-existing conditions to mandated insurance with pre-existing conditions.  The Democrats will do whatever it takes to get Republican support, and the Republicans know this.

The Democrats will *never* force a filibuster because in the event this fails they will all be done for.  The Republicans called their bluff and now the Democrats have to pick up the pieces.

It's really that simple.","1264988202"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","My point is that a lot of the things included in graduate econometrics classes go way beyond the basics (obviously). Now, if you want to do research in Econometrics, it is absolutely necessary. If you want to use econometric tools to do other research.... maybe not so necessary, depending. 

One thing I had to do in my grad program was prove the relationships between the values of first and second derivatives and the existence of a max or min in a constrained optimization problem. To this point I had done constrained optimization for years without knowing the proofs and two days after the exam I would never again be able to produce them. Is anyone going to question my maximization results in the future? No. 

Even if I did do a lot of theoretical modelling, I wouldn't need to prove it. This is what I was getting at. 

A lot of very talented and creative people leave the discipline because they can't handle the math. It's unfortunate because a lot of the work they could have done would never had needed it in the first place.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Michael Moore shouldn't rail against programs from which he goes on to benefit - indeed.
But let's be serious, a tax break is not the same thing as a subsidy (or a bailout!). It means you don't have to pay as much in taxes, and while that means less revenue collected in taxes, it means more revenue for private businesses; that's more revenue for film companies and more revenue for the surrounding businesses who benefit from the film companies coming to Michigan, having benefited from lower taxes.
See this article: http://detnews.com/article/20090604/OPINION01/906040343/Lawmakers-debate-limits-to-Michigan-film-incentives

I dislike both Michael Moore and the Mackinac Center, and the reason is evident entirely in this video: they're both opportunistic political attackers, without regard for reason or evidence. Moore acted hypocritically, but the Mackinac Center should know the difference between a tax break, a subsidy, and a bailout. Meanwhile, I am really not sure why the Mackinac Center seems to oppose the tax break in this video, since that would normally seem to be right in line with their agenda (unless the reason is they want a tax cut versus a tax credit - but I'm now suspicious as to whether they know the difference!).","1264988286"

While e-ink resolution and refresh rate are currently inferior, I think we all agree this is merely temporary. 
And cheap novels printed on rough paper reads just fine, I don't think exact typography is ever a hindrance. Also, most popular books are produced in vastly different sizes in hardcover, paperback, smaller paperback, etc. It can be argued that ebook reader fits individuals better because they can tweak the font size to their liking. 

The internet is slowly killing paper magazine/newspaper. And soon ebook reader will be just another portable portal to the internet and books are just another type of content. We as the current generation might have attachment to the old way and mistake it for advantages, but I don't see us convincing a teenager in 10 years, to bring a long a few pounds of book when he already has everything in his 10th generation E-ink color iPad.

I've participated online since before there was an Internet; I remember when BBSs were common.  I've seen discussions on this topic happen literally hundreds of times.  Often, women asking ""Does my husband really like licking me down there, or is he just pretending?""

I do not remember ever seeing any man say ""I don't like it"", except a gay man who said that was the final nail in the coffin of denying he was gay.  Every time this comes up, every man who replies says ""Not pretending.  Really like it.""  Even if I've forgotten one (not impossible at my age), it's still 99.9999% in favor.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Alright, this is something one of the guys at work told me.

This goes out to Steve Sibly.  This is his story (if you know him, please tell it to him).

Steve was out one night trawling for chicks.  He's not much of a looker, so he was very surprised when this hotty comes over and starts chatting to him.  One thing leads to another and they go home to her place.

They hop into bed and Steve shrugs off the rubber sheets.  They're getting into it and the girl grabs a butt plug out of a drawer.  Steve doesn't mind if she's into that and says so.  She informs him it's not for her.

Reflecting on the hotness of the chick, Steve carries on with a butt plug burried in his nether region.  Just as he's about to come, she whips it out and he shits *everywhere*.  She's totally understanding and tells him to go have a shower.  Mortified he runs off and does so.

When he gets back to the bedroom, he finds this girl **covered** in his shit.  He freaks out, grabs his clothes and bolts.  A few streets away, he realises he has *no* idea where he is and starts door knocking.  This guy lets him in and after looking at Steve asks him if he needs a cup of tea.  Steve accepts while he waits for a cab.

That's pretty much the story my mate told me and he's just waiting for it to get back to Steve.","1264988400"

Most people's only experience with fountain pens is seeing them used as gags in period movies, where they inevitably leak, or squirt ink in someone's face.  In fact, fountain pens are much more technologically advanced than ballpoint pens, which took over the market because they were cheap.

Yup, and despite this, they showed carefully selected benchmarks with the PowerBooks outperforming their Pentium-M rivals.

&gt; The PPC970 was a scaled-down server chip (the POWER4). It was very powerful (much faster than the Intels at the time) but the damn thing was power-hungry and ran incredibly hot.

Kind of like the complaints about the Xeon at the time.

&gt; The Dual G5 (which I still own) has a fuck-off big liquid cooling array to stop the damn chip from melting through the case!

Yup, and bragged about their extensive cooling system like it was this genius advantage, rather than a necessity to overcome the problems with the chip.

&gt; So Apple has no choice but to drop them and switch to Intels.

Well, they had no choice but to give up on IBM, but they had lots of other options.

&gt; The first generation of Intel macs came 18 months after the Dual Quad G5 towers, and were only 10-20% faster, which says something about the quality of the PPC 970 chips.

Ah, but as I showed, they have links demonstrating the Intel systems were as much as 5x faster (one of the tricks was to compare it against a PowerPC with half the cores, which was so shameful they ought to be embarrassed).

&gt; The successor to the G5 chip, the POWER5 is still in use in IBM's Big Iron servers.

I got nothing against the chips. I really liked the Power architecture (at least compared to Intel), just the ""four legs good, two legs better!"" marketing approach.","1264988428"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you're having trouble with the idea of the universe as a recursive function, you could think about it instead as a video tape. The first frame on the tape corresponds to the state of the universe at the big bang, and each subsequent frame corresponds to a subsequent state of the universe a short time later. 

If you were a character in the movie on the tape, you'd be able to talk about time relative to your position on the tape, (Five minutes ago, Five minutes from now, 2000 years from 1AD, 13.7 billion years from the Big Bang...) but it wouldn't make sense to think that the video tape's age is determined in terms of frames on the tape; the video tape doesn't stop existing because you rewound it to the first frame on the tape. 

Now, thinking about it as a video tape instead of a mathematical structure, like a recursive function, leads you to problems with infinite universes, and this is where the analogy breaks down a bit. (If you're thinking of it as a video tape instead of a function, then where did the universe that that tape is in come from?) 

I'll come back and write some more later about how to get from the video tape way of thinking to the abstract existence way of thinking, but I need to take a break. Are you with me so far in this line of reasoning?","1264988485"

You get to this place where  you question everything about yourself and as hard as you try there will remain parts of your past that are very ingrained in you.  Example: Not working or recreating on Sunday was a big deal in my family.  Since leaving religion I still have irrational worries about Sunday stuff.  I feel like something bad will happen if I purchase things on sunday even though I know this is completely irrational and any confirmatory evidence I find is confirmation bias.  Akin to having a bad day and being convinced that worse things are going to happen because you're having a 'bad' day.  Then you only pay attention to the things that go wrong, voila, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

If an organism doesn't reproduce, then evolution does not apply to it, since (generally) evolution happens as a consequence of reproduction. Also, if an organism is immortal but doesn't reproduce, then most likely, other organisms that do reproduce within the same ecological niche would eventually crowd it out.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Possibly. For me, it's a tale of sustainability:

First Apple dropped support for my old Powerbook (Snow Leopard won't run on PowerPC.) Then when I finally needed to replace it, I got a $400 15"" widescreen Windows 7 notebook, instead of a new 15"" Macbook Pro that would have been *four times* the price.

At which point, interoperability just became easier when my desktop Intel Mac was running Windows. I can play games again; I was already back on Firefox (from Safari) for the plugin support; and iTunes actually has a maximize button on Windows.

So basically Apple gave me some good reasons to switch to OSX; but their ""the user is always wrong"" attitude never gave me any reasons to stay. There are problems with OSX that Apple will never fix.

(As an aside, I'm convinced that this arrogance of ""the user is wrong"" will be the death of Apple on the desktop - and it'll start from the top in media production. Their pro apps are bleeding out their customer base: Aperture has lost to Adobe Lightroom; the latest Final Cut is mediocre: massively outdated, unstable, still not 64-bit, still has no actual support for Blu-Ray. The iPad may be great - but their serious apps are a joke.)","1264988584"

Politely as possible, railstay, *I have completed ME1 on Insanity.* I said it **stops** the **regeneration**. I said nothing about it removing their immunity, in fact, I said I would switch to the inevitable SECOND Krogan while the first immunity - immune, but not regenerating - wore off.

&gt; So you're going to tell me this organization dropped billions on bringing you back, designing you the most advanced warship in the galaxy and you still have to ""work"" your way up to better guns? Breaks the disbelief. Mass Effect 2 did a lot of things very well, including how many gameplay mechanics make sense with the events of the game.

Yes, I'm going to tell you that. Why? Well, have you seen the collectors recently? Or the reapers? Evolution is ahead of us right now, and many other things are still ahead of us in ME2. It's folly to think that humanity would have the best technology at any point. After all, billions of dollars didn't save the Normandy the first go round and it certainly won't save it the second if you don't find external ways to upgrade it further, if your token black man is to be believed. 

Heck. Cerberus couldn't come near what Sovereign did to Saren, if they did, there would be no game. You'd jump from wall to wall and press a win button repeatedly.

Based upon what you said in your OP you have proof of an ongoing relationship.  Tangible indisputable proof.  If that's all it will take to clear up the problem why drag it out?  If it doesn't make you look bad or guilty why not show them?

Edit

I read your update, it sounds like it went ok.  For now definitely take a bit of time while everything is fresh in your mind and write down all the questions they asked and the answers you gave.  Also write down any other statements they made.  Gather all of your evidence, back up all the soft copy on CD and print it out as well.  Talk to friends who know you were a couple and get them to sign statements.  Make three copies of everything.  Seal one up and put it someplace secure, a safe deposit box comes to mind.  Keep the other copies with you, again in a secure place, just in case you need it.  Don't delete the original messages off of your phone or email.  Do some research on local lawyers, just in case, once you've narrowed the list down to a couple of them go by their offices and pick up their business cards, put those in your wallet.

IF you get a call that they're going to prosecute or if you're arrested get in touch with one of your prescreened lawyers right away.  Give him one of the evidence envelopes so he has a full breakdown of everything that's happened.

This is how I feel.  Other people, for their own reasons, will feel differently.  The final decision is yours, you have to do what feels right for you.  What I say, what zornjrb says, none of it means anything if it doesn't work for you.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","YEARS ago - mid 90's a least I read an article about the dangers of creatine and grapefruit juice. It was from a legitimate source - maybe the boston globe or something - it was before the internet. So I can't find anything in a quick search I just did except the following which is not really a great source:

&gt;Though some sources report otherwise, it is generally recommended that you not mix creatine with citrus juice. Orange, grapefruit, cranberry, in fact, most fruit juices have been most recently found to neutralize the activity of creatine monohydrate. The reason is the waste product creatine develops. Many users put creatine on your tongue and drink it down with grapefruit juice. If you have taken creatine this way in the past, stop it now! You are not getting creatine, you're getting waste product.

Source: http://www.usgyms.net/creatine.htm

Anyways, The article identified Grapefruit juice specifically - not ""citrus"" etc, and there are legitimate dangers with Grapefruit juice and medications - now of course creatine is not a med, but there certainly are valid food interactions. I remember this because my boyfriend at the time started taking it and I became really concerned because of the article. Here is more on grape fruit juice : http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050124010803.htm

So I was wondering if you now anything for sure on this. I really don't care to hear ""i don't think so"" because that is just bad advice and potentially dangerous. but if you do in fact know for sure, could you tel us please?","1264988654"

I don't think a guerrilla-type force, fighting against a better-armed enemy, could really ask for much a much better weapon than a civilian-style .30-06 deer rifle with a telescopic sight.  Fighting on your own turf, choosing the time and place to attack, with the support of the local people, and being a decent 100-yard shot with a rifle much more powerful than a standard US infantry weapon, able to penetrate body armor, and the element of surprise ... I don't think any civilian insurgency would need M16-type .223 full-autos to turn any attempted military incursion into a Viet Cong-style quagmire.  Sure, the military could conceivably convince their guys to bomb their own countrymen, but every bomb they dropped would spawn another thousand men and women with deer rifles to take potshots at them while they're taking a piss.

"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","I understand your post.  I disagree.  As I said before.  We live in a very complex society where minarchist libertarian ideals have quetstionable practical value.  They have theoretical value, in much the same way me imagining that I can fly through the air in my dreams makes me feel better.  But when I wake up in the real world, I find I can't fly.  

Likewise, this notion of a minimal government that does nothing but provide national defense and run a court system, has no working example anywhere in the history of humanity.  I'm not sure how you figure such a system would ever get established.  It sure won't happen by electing Ron Paul.  Do you think you can get a bunch of libertarians elected into Congress and then they'll suddenly vote to disband the government?  I'm trying to figure out at what point your ideas are anything more than a fantasy that you have chosen to share with others in forums like this, and where they have any practical means of being implemented in modern society?  Do you think for a moment that if the government stopped regulating transportation, utilities, commerce and other areas that things would be better off?  I think you really underestimate the day-to-day benefits you gain from government support in modern day life, and how much more chaotic and unreliable things would be if private industry were less regulated.

And as I keep saying over and over, I can point to examples of areas where less regulation = more exploitation.  It's never the other way around, never.   So don't accuse me of not understanding what you mean. I understand what you mean.  I'm just saying, it appears to be an idea that isn't practical, and rather than give me exact details of how it could be practical, all you can do is talk in vague generalities or refer me to someone else who talks in vague generalities.  

Many years ago, I had a phone call with Harry Browne.  We talked for about two hours and I felt the same way... I liked the guys ideas but I was concerned about whether or not the libertarians actually had a *plan*.  I know they have *theories* but how to realistically put those theories into practice is another matter entirely.   That's when I found out Browne had no clue either.

I urge everybody to think for themselves.  Don't take my word for it.  Go look over every post in this thread.  Where is the **plan?**  There's no plan.  It's all a bunch of pompous ideas, and when someone inquires, they get sent off on a wild goose chase reading various published philosophies by other like-minded people.  Meanwhile, we live in the real world.  Not one of these guys will explain, realistically, how something like the Internet could ever exist in their minarchist society.  They talk theoretically of how things might seem ""fair"" if they had their way, but they insist they can only prove it if they get 100% of what they want.  If they get 99% of their terms and things fail horribly, they'll still claim their ideas are workable and the reason is because of the missing 1%.   Over and over, it's the same thing.   Corporations fuck people up the ass each day, every day, but no.... if the market was totally open, suddenly that would change.   It sure seems like blind ideological thinking to me.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Your questions are alright. I understand your oppositions - without sarcasm, I'm the ""big bad drug dealer who shoots at cops and disregard justice in general"".

I did not want to tell this much, but I suppose I might as well: I've never been a hardcore criminal. I've never shot a gun. I started doing drugs early, saw an opportunity, and took it. It was really stupid, I regretted it for months afterwards (the stress was terrible), but I did it. I'd never hurt people or commit crimes but I did participate in a relatively organized, medium-sized drug business, and did many errands for them.

That being said, I do not believe I should be punished because I think the legal system in general is a **farce** (once again, I did not want to get this far in the subject, but I have no choice). It goes down to this: only amateurs get caught. Wall Street scammers keep cashing in bonus, good day bad day. George Bush can rest in his private house with his high-paying retirement fund despite the fact he killed thousands of innocent for his oil-friends. Major Columbian cartel continue to exist, supported by the CIA, which is itself supported by its tax.

Even on a lower level, the justice system makes no sense. Have more money, hire a better attorney, serve less. Why? Why should someone who has more money serves less time in jail? The whole concept of jail doesn't make sense, neither, at least with extended sentences. Let's say the average human lives 70 years. Let's say every jail sentence is 7 years. Then each time someone is convicted, he loses 0.1 of his life. You might be against death penalty (for other reasons, I perfectly agree with you) but the justice system DOES kill people - just as a percentage. It's a waste of life, and energy. Jail for me is torture.

That being said, some people do belong in jail, and I'm not saying all crimes should go unpunished, but I think the game is rigged. Get money, you can pretty much go to Thailand and rape all the kids you want. Be broke, get arrested for downloading child porn. I'm not a big bad guy who beats the crap out of people. I made my mistakes and I think the system is rigged. I would be treated exactly like any drug dealer, even those who have been committing that crime for years. 

I don't believe I did deserve to be punished. It's a stupid mistake, and in my mind, not a THAT big crime. Years in jail? Which basically equals getting beat, tortured, abused? The legal system is broken. What would being punished change? They basically take a random number of years based on stupid crap going through the judge's mind and impose to you. What is it going to change? I understand penalizing someone who hurt another person, but come on - spending years of your life in jail won't change crap.","1264988803"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I'm pretty sure that strategy is doomed from the start. There has always been an anti-Mormon movement, and the more rabid and angry it has been, the less effective it ended up being.

My deconversion was hindered greatly by anti-Mormon types on the Internet. They always wanted to fight about it. They always wanted to toss dirt on my religion. It was truly my religion still, even during my time of questioning, and the worst possible thing an ex-mormon could do to help their cause was to grind their axe as if it were some kind of obsession. People like this think they're convincing when really all they're doing is rallying their own troops and making it an us-versus-them issue. An honest questioner looks at anti-Mormon commentary and just sees foaming at the mouth and bloodshot eyes. For this very reason I was not able to actually trust any of the historical information I read until I finally got it from a quasi-LDS source. Who is an honest Mormon going to believe? Some Internet troll saying, ""hey moron, JS had monkey sex wif 14 yr old"" or a respected professional church historian?

So please, if you want to help another deconvert, do not go into attack mode. Do the exact opposite. What really pushed me over the edge was that I was eventually able to find intelligent, loving, appreciative, and kind commentary by ex-mormons and atheists. They made such good arguments about the reasons for their lack of belief without insulting believers. They just seemed so reasonable and fair-minded. I felt like I could ask questions and share my thoughts without getting ridiculed. 

On an individual level, the best chance you have is to show that you are an awesome, caring person that will not antagonize others for their beliefs. Show them that you understand where they're coming from and explain to them calmly and nicely (seriously, kill them with nice) why you believe differently. It can blow them away if they learn that ex-mormons are actually wonderful people.","1264988829"

But we can't rule out dinosaurs with, say, very early stone age levels of societies.

If there's no evidence available, a proposal is arbitrary and is just speculation. It's kind of fun, but doesn't mean anything scientifically.

This is an entirely different thing; it is not a predicate at all.

What? Are we reading different textbooks? Not only do chained comparisons make perfect sense, not only are they very definitely predicates, but compared to the clunky long explicit notation they are _awesome_.

&gt; You might think a compiler could do several optimizations here, and you'd be right.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have always known i wanted to be a teacher, and up until my second semester of sophmore year i had thought i wanted to be a theatre education teacher.  But then i realized the last thing i ever wanted to do was surround myself with high school theatre kids for the rest of my life.

I then took a trip through New England last year for the first time and saw what america was really fighting for in the revolutionary war, then my thoughts moved to how every moment has had to happen exactly the way it happend for this moment right now to exist....it tripped me out, and has always intrigued me.

After more thought i realized that the way history teachers teach the way things have happened and what history truly is, it can totally change the way one views the world as a whole.

so thats in a nut shell why i am going to be a history teacher.","1264988908"

"HealthProject","t5_2rf4d","I haven't really tried it but I can provide you a few reputable sources to help with your research:

**[UK Dept of Health on Ramadan Fasting](http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_078409)**

&gt;* As the Ramadan fast only extends from dawn till dusk, there is ample opportunity to replenish energy stores at pre-dawn and dusk meals. This provides a progressive, gentle transition from using glucose to fat as the main source of energy, and prevents the breakdown of muscle for protein. The use of fat for energy aids weight loss, preserving the muscles, and in the long run reduces your cholesterol levels. In addition, weight loss results in better control of diabetes and reduces blood pressure. 

&gt;* A detoxiﬁcation process also *seems* to occur, as any toxins stored in the body’s fat are dissolved and removed from the body. After a few days of the fast, higher levels of certain hormones appear in the blood (endorphins), resulting in a better level of alertness and an overall feeling of general mental well-being. 

&gt;* A fasting person learns restraint, and only responds to hunger and thirst in the heightened level of consciousness and discipline. Through fasting, a person begins to appreciate the value of food. In the Qur’an “healthy and wholesome food” is described as the best of provisions. Thus fasting helps a person to choose a healthier lifestyle by making small yet lasting changes to their daily diet.

**[Healthfinder.gov on Alternate-day Fasting](http://www.healthfinder.gov/news/newsstory.aspx?docID=632897)**

&gt; The subjects lost between 10 and 30 pounds, well beyond the expected loss of 5 pounds on average. The study participants also managed to lower their blood pressure, cholesterol levels and heart rate.

It *seems* promising... :)

Good luck.","1264988985"
"vegan","t5_2qhpm","I think some people miss the point here.

The question is, would we be vegan if animals were cared for properly?

So first, to distinguish, the thing that separates us from vegetarians is the fact that we avoid all animal products, not just the meat.

Why do we avoid the animal products? A few reasons, but primarily to prevent animal suffering.

So to answer your question, I would become vegetarian if I could buy my eggs directly from someone in my community who happens to have some hens and a surplus of eggs. I dislike milk, but if I liked it, I would see no issue with buying milk from someone in my community that had dairy cows who have a surplus of milk, and so on.

I think people forget that there can be a symbiotic relationship between us and animals. Someone who has pet hens has a relationship with them that is mutually beneficial. The hens are ensured survival, as they have a very capable being that will feed them, and protect them from predators. We get nutrition from their unfertilised eggs, which would otherwise go to waste. Because we gain life, and they gain life, there is incentive for us to keep the species going.

Why are cows sacred in hindu religions? Because they recognise the symbiotic relationship with cows is far greater than eating the cow.

So then: What would need to be done to farming industries to make me become a vegetarian? They would have to be decentralised, and community based. The owner would have to maintain a personal and respectful relationship with the animal. 

What would need to be done to farming industries to make me into an omnivore? Producing [in vitro meat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat). No exceptions to this, except in the case where the animals do not have brains and therefore are not conscious beings and are equivalent to plants.

EDIT: I should also point out that I dislike eggs, milk, cheese and a lot of meat purely based on how it makes me feel physically. Perhaps there is a psychological reason behind this, as it is a very good form of nutrition. But I feel this is because of the many negative health aspects of eating such things. So even if these changes did happen in farming, I would still eat meat and animal products at a minimum.","1264988988"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Humans have a biological imperative of survival.  Above anything society or philosophy tells you, the real driving force behind anything you do, the real core of any motivation you have, is survival instinct.  As such, this means that whenever we judge anything, we are essentially judging how secure it will make us, or rather, how much it will help or hinder our chances of survival.  When faced with a scenario wherein there is a significant unknown factor, it makes more sense to go with the safe, calculable option instead of gambling survival for a mere possibility.  This  means in effect that as humans, we are afraid of the unknown (and as a side note, we aren't afraid of anything else).  Whenever we are presented with a situation, even a hypothetical one, that makes us question our own security (remember, security is being able to assure survival), we become afraid as a defense mechanism.

The scene in question, when considered in context, is a vivid message that portrays humanity as ignorant, and under direct threat from something that we aren't sure how to fight (read as ""something we *don't understand*).  Thus, so long as a person is suspending their disbelief about the movie, they will find the scene startling at least, and probably more unsettling depending on their personality.","1264989005"

Kind of, yeah. If there's a potential advantage to marketing the cooling system, I'm sure they'd take advantage of it.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;A job-seeker, in order to be hired, must be able to produce a value to an employer at least equal to the legal minimum wage.

Though this is technically true, a company would go bankrupt working on this minimum. The employee must provide value well over the minimum wage, that is, minimum wage plus administrative costs plus a share of the rent for the space and the capital. In other words, there is no set floor, though there is a ceiling (in a system without minimum wage). The market then, of course, determines the price on that person's wage.

However, we're not talking about a fair market. *Any* business will take *anyone* who can provide that value (and since we're talking about low-skill jobs, anyone could really fill that role), while any particular prospective employee *must* take whatever job is willing to pay the highest. Bear in mind we're not talking about highly skilled jobs that can supply the employer with incentives to seek out a good match, but low-skilled jobs that anyone with four limbs and a grasp of the language can do.

So the bargaining power of the employer is vastly more than that of the employee, because the employer will not starve if that particular person isn't hired, but that particular person might. It comes down to the fact that *any* price on her/his labor is rational to avoid dying, so no floor for that person either. 

Due to a bargaining power disparity, the price on labor drops significantly in absence of a minimum wage.","1264989066"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;You express a belief in the Scriptures, and I trust your confidence in Scripture is not selective. If you believe all Scripture is inspired, then you are compelled to accept that legal sanctions may appropriately be applied to those who engage in homosexual behavior.

The cognitive dissonance here is jaw-dropping. Do I even need to list all the horrifying ""laws"" of the OT that I would be compelled to accept? Stoning someone to death for working on the Sabbath, killing your children for being disrespectful, selling your daughters into slavery?

And keep in mind that he's basing his opinions on medical claims, while the Bible is against homosexuality for ""moral"" reasons, so he's not even adhering to the Scripture that he obliviously says we should accept as a whole:

&gt;It might be worth noting that what I actually suggested is that we impose the same sanctions on those who engage in homosexual behavior as we do on those who engage in intravenous drug abuse, since both pose the same kind of risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.

Furthermore, as if his insipid statements even need further inspection, what are his medical qualifications for his claims? What are his references?

[Let's take a look](http://action.afa.net/detail.aspx?id=2147486648): ""An undergraduate degree in philosophy from Stanford University, and a graduate degree in theology from Dallas Theological Seminary."" Clearly, someone qualified to rattle off medical claims without citation, and qualified to propose a framework to deal with homosexuality as an issue of health care and psychiatry.

And now he's the ""director of Issue Analysis for Government and Public Policy at American Family Association,"" despite the full extent of his political experience being the *chaplain* of the *Idaho State Senate* for *one year*, and a stint as the head of Boise Parks and Rec.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was 19, our family had my twin brother and I clean out the garage while we were on a break from college, and my brother found 2 stacks of shoe boxes all the way in the back, a total of 10-12 boxes. We open them up, and all of them are full of burnt, large-denomination cash, lots of 20s and 50s. Probably close to $50,000. We asked our parents about it, and they both clammed up at first, but my mother pulled me aside after the fact and explained what had happened. I guess her sister-in-law had a operated a couple of restaurants with her (the sister-in-law's) father and that about 30 years ago, the flagship restaurant burnt to the ground, and had about 2 weeks worth of till money in the safe, which was, apparently, not fireproof. My mother was concerned, because the day after the fire, her sister-in-law comes to her with all of this burnt money, and asks her to have her husband (my dad, a banker) get the bank he worked for to exchange the burnt money for cash. My mother also knew, from talking to her brother (sister-in-law's husband), that they had filed an insurance claim including the money in the safe. This ""small"" insurance fraud had my mom wondering if maybe the restaurant was burnt to the ground intentionally, in order to collect the insurance money, because her sister-in-law's other restaurants filed bankruptcy about 1 month after the insurance investigation had ended and the money was paid out. She told my father of course, but didn't want him to face criminal charges or lose his job at the bank if it turned out that it was insurance fraud. Even after the fire was ruled not arson (it was the late 70's, and a restaurant, how hard would it be to make it look like an accident?), they were always too afraid to try to exchange the burnt bills but didn't want to get rid of them in case they ended up being evidence or something. Anyways, the money is now in a do-it-yourself storage place; my brother and I always planned to try to get at least some of it exchanged at some point in the future, but we've always been worried about the consequences of saying we have it.

First 3 bosses. Absolutely perfect with no deaths whatsoever. We wiped twice on the fourth boss, then I talked it through with everyone, did it again with no deaths then did the final boss with only one death. No vent or voice chat needed either.

If they had done just a little more research, found some of the few interviews that exist with Fever Ray or The Knife, they would have found out that they've been doing this kind of shit for years (as Brendan87 points out). In fact, The Knife always perform in costume (when they perform) and whatever few photoshoots and public appearances they've done have also been in costume. It's not some sort of artsy-fartsy thing; there is no greater meaning to it. They just want to highlight their music, and the costumes (and their general reluctance to do interviews) are their way of not contributing to reporting on anything but the music.

"science","t5_mouw","I have no problems with corporations. They are amazingly good at what they do; producing commodities and wealth. But, I think that they have to be regulated to a certain extent (as most economic advisers of the world would likely agree). Corporations will do what is best for their major share holders, and I would say that the majority of market capitalization is owned by a minority of the citizens of any given country. With that said, some men get more rights and are more ""free"" than the average man. So, placing subsidies to have corporations act in a way that benefits its citizens is often seen as a good thing by the majority (those that elect the leaders). This may be to give grants for research that will allow corporations to get payloads into space cheaply. Once the government helps the corporations get their foot in the door the corporations can do what they do best, make it cheaper and more efficient. My model is tried, tested and true in much of the world. You are the outlier. And I believe that there are outcomes that are objectively beneficial, such as cleaner air, less population, better health coverage, etc.

I went back and while we walked over, I looked at the photo and my phone was clearly visible in the picture on the grass. It was still there when we went back to the frog.

If you were pulling the two sleds such that the ropes were not parallel to the direction of motion (sleds touching side-by-side), then it requires *more* force to overcome friction than if the rope is straight, as in the one-sled case.

This is why carrying a shopping bag that has bulky contents seems heavier: because the handles are not hanging vertically and only part of the force you are exerting goes into pulling the sled or the shopping bag.

As for technology, China is very much on par with Japan when it comes to current military technology. China also has more of the modern equipment while Japan still has some rather old technology filling out their ranks.  They certainty have the means to easily out match China technologically, but that is why China does not want Japan to fully rearm.   

Just compare the air forces of the two countries.  With the size and advances being made technologically, China clearly dominates Japan.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","A 2007 article in the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology has examined just this question: ""The Chronic Dependence of Popular Religiosity upon Dysfunctional Psychosociological Conditions.""

Here's the [PDF](http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP07398441_c.pdf) to the article, and the abstract:

""Abstract: Better understanding the nature, origin and popularity of varying levels of popular religion versus secularism, and their impact upon socioeconomic conditions and vice versa, requires a cross national comparison of the competing factors in populations where opinions are freely chosen. 

Utilizing 25 indicators, the uniquely extensive Successful Societies Scale reveals that population diversity and immigration correlate weakly with 1st world socioeconomic conditions, and high levels of income disparity, popular religiosity as measured by differing levels of belief and activity, and rejection of evolutionary science correlate strongly negatively with improving conditions. 

The historically unprecedented socioeconomic security that results from low levels of progressive government policies appear to suppress popular religiosity and creationist opinion, conservative religious ideology apparently contributes to societal dysfunction, and religious prosociality and charity are less effective at improving societal conditions than are secular government programs. 

The antagonistic relationship between a better socioeconomic conditions and intense popular faith may prevent the existence of nations that combine the two factors. The nonuniversality of strong religious devotion, and the ease with large populations abandon serious theism when conditions are sufficiently benign, refute hypotheses that religious belief and practice are the normal, deeply set human mental state, whether they are superficial or natural in nature. 

Instead, popular religion is usually a superficial and flexible psychological mechanism for coping with the high levels of stress and anxiety produced by sufficiently dysfunctional social and especially economic environments. Popular nontheism is a similarly casual response to superior conditions.""","1264989365"

The more you know about Israel and its history, the more you understand that being a gentleman to a pig is how a pig fucks you in the ass. While people with no context observing the conflict today consider the wrong side or both side pigs the reality of the struggle is far different than what your lying television has sold you.

To play by the rules is not how you win against Israel, that's how you get deceived by them.

[World Cup Soccer](http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2811) has a soccer goal with a moving goalie you have to shoot past.  This is actually a pretty fun game, it has a pretty nice playfield flow to it.  

[NBA Fastbreak](http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=4023) scores like a basketball game so most high scores I've seen are only in the 200-300 point range.  It has a flipper in the backbox that you shoot free throws with in certain modes.

"science","t5_mouw","If Americans gave up soda, for which they spend [66 billion dollars a year](http://www.casapalmera.com/blog/our-addiction-to-soda-what-we-can-do-to-stop/) and, instead, donated that money to food for the hungry in other parts of the world, that would improve the lot of the hungry far more, since NASA's nominal budget for 2009 was 17.2 billion dollars. But that's not going to happen. And, if NASA's budget was eliminated entirely, do you reallly think that's where the money would go?

NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) programs, as well as other program, are benefitting people on earth. I've excerpted a few paragraphs from [NASA Earth Science Data and Services: Distant fields of grain](http://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/articles/2009/2009_crops.html):


&gt; From his Santa Barbara office, geographer Chris Funk is trying to watch ears of maize in Zimbabwe fill with kernels. Funk knows that years of drought and turmoil in Zimbabwe make it urgent to know exactly how well crops are growing there. As of February 2009, an estimated seven million people in Zimbabwe faced serious food shortages, many surviving on just one meal per day. Zimbabwe’s once-thriving agricultural production had fallen by more than half, and both political upheaval and drought contributed to the prospects of widespread hunger. The unraveling of the agricultural system also made it difficult to get good estimates of crop production. Funk said, “Governmental numbers don’t really exist. As a result, there were different ideas about the level of crop production in Zimbabwe.”

&gt; &lt;text snipped&gt;

&gt; Funk and Budde are studying Zimbabwean food issues as part of an interagency effort on world food security. Funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the project includes several partners, including NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), with which both Funk, at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Budde, at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, are affiliated. Not so long ago, outsiders became aware of a nation’s food crisis only when it had reached a dire stage: images of starving children flooded the news, as well as images of aid workers struggling to send relief in time. Satellites are among the technologies that now help people determine ways to intervene earlier, and in a more targeted manner. More than ten years ago, Funk worked on his first project to study crop production in southern Africa, using satellite data. Funk said, “I got hooked on the idea of using satellite information to help people in the developing world.”

Funk and other researchers are using data captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/)), which is an instrument on NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecraft, and distributed through the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).","1264989384"

"politics","t5_2cneq","The rhetoric is very to get through, which makes discussion about it very difficult.

Anyways, 'type S' corporations are those that are owned by a person(s) that take all of the revenue at the end of the year for themselves, and pay taxes as an individual (instead of paying taxes as a corporation). This allows some tax relief for the owner, and if I understand correctly, makes it easy for revenue to be spent/allocated by the company without being held to state/federal regulations. 

Typically, the smaller-to-mid sized companies are 's type' companies, like small grocery stores and trinket shops. In the recent months, I read that s-type corporations account for ~15-20% of the employment in Oregon. I can't find that reference right now, so you'll have to take that with a grain of salt. But if I do remember correctly, this would mean that a majority of corporations in the state are not s-type, and could be facing a retroactive (from starting of 2009), 0.1% tax. 

I spoke with a local lawyer about the phrasing ""...some corporations with over $500k...."" (pretty iffy if you ask me), and he's confident that it was written such that different interpretations could be made of the measure, allowing for some wiggle room. He said it would be very hard to enforce a hard and fast rule to all corporations. It basically puts the impetus on the corporation to prove to the state that they do or don't meet some requirements and that their tax rules should be changed, making life a lot easier for the government. Makes sense to me. 

Anyways, hope this clears things up a bit. As you pointed out, a tax on gross revenue is a bit ridiculous. Even though its been portrayed as an ""across the board 0.1% tax"" on everyone, I'm confident that people will be able to find a way to get out of this tax bracket. But, I'm also confident that most corps won't be able to do such, and will have to cut back on their employment (not only future, but current as the taxes are retroactive, and may require some companies to cut back in order to make projections for the next year).

That said, you are correct. Large and wide, the judicial system is a joke. I do have a couple of follow up questions for you:

- Does it really make your jail time less deserved because more serious criminals are living comfortable with no fear of prosecution? Does someone who commit a crime not still commit that crime, regardless of the actions of others?

- What do you think should be done to criminals if not send them to jail? While I agree that jail ought to be rehabilitative, where do you draw the line between who's sent there for the purpose of paying their debt to society, and someone sent there to get better?

- It's hard to gauge the situation without knowing what you did exactly, what drugs you dealt with, and what your track record was. I fully understand if you are not willing to release this information, but is it possible for you to expand a bit to offer a better understanding of what happened?

Wish granted. :P Every trans activist I know and read is possessed of just such a mentality. Out of necessity, really. It's the only way one can live a life that's even remotely productive as a trans person in this society, you have to have an almost unhealthy dose of self confidence.

That confidence manifests itself, in part, in the very thing you seem to be criticising. Not wanting to take shit from anyone, no matter how powerful. How activism is often construed as this weak, victimising thing is rather vexing to me. Rather than truckling before the views of reactionaries we challenge them brazenly.

It isn't always about saying ""we are victims"", though that adjective is salient in some cases and that ought not to be denied, but to say quite firmly ""we are we."" We are who we say we are: these are our lives, these are our experiences, we are *not* this parodied stereotype you imagine. That's pretty damn empowering and requires quite a lot of can-do and a lot of overcoming internalised self-victimisation before that even becomes possible.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was coming home from a friend's house late one night. As I approached an intersection I saw a car pull out from a stop and cut off a motorcycle that was doing ~60MPH.  The bike goes down, throwing the passenger clear and trapping the driver. The douche in the car stops to look at the mess, and then speeds off. 

I pulled over and went to check out the guys on the motorcycle. They were hurt pretty badly but both of them were conscious. They asked me to take them to the hospital.

It was 1990 and I was in college so I didn't have a cell phone. We were out in the middle of nowhere, so I didn't feel like driving 10 minutes to get to a pay phone when I could just drive them to the hospital in 15 minutes. They'd both gotten up after the spill, so I didn't have to worry about keeping them immobile. So the driver hopped over to the car and sprawled out in the backseat. The passenger sat up front with me. At about that time a couple of guys in a pickup showed up. They volunteered to move the bike out of the road and I hauled ass.

By the time I got back to the car, the guy in the back seat had passed out.  They guy in the front seat stayed conscious, but he kept jumping in his seat every 30 seconds and asking me where he was and what had happened. I'd tell him, and we'd repeat the same cycle 30 seconds later.

I drove about 90 until I got into town, and then 60 through the residential streets. I was flashing my hi-beams and laying on the horn at intersections (stupid of me - I could have killed someone else, but I was amped on adrenaline and it seemed the right thing to do at the time).

I got them to the hospital and went inside. As I was coming into the ER, a door burst open and two sets of guys with gurneys came charging out asking if I was the guy with the motorcycle victims (the guys on the truck had just gotten to a pay phone and called the accident in.) A cop took my statement and I headed home.

I called the hospital the next day to check up on them.  The guy in the front seat had a severe concussion and a compound fracture in his left arm. The guy in the backseat was bad; all 10 toes broken, left arm broken in 3 places, concussion, dislocated knee, and fractured pelvis.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; It would be nice if you coiuld find a line that ""attacks all opponents of prorogation as being ill-informed and ignorant."" 

Here's two:

* ""In all the excitement about prorogation it has become fairly obvious that the vast majority of the Canadian public—present company included—don’t know much about what it actually is.""
* ""I am glad that people care about this issue, but I do hope that they will take the time to figure out exactly why and what it is they are protesting.""

And it's a laugh to say that I was dismissing her article without substance. She sets up straw men for her political opponents (""All they could do is rely on the sound bites and talking points of the opposition parties, which are repeated ad nauseum by Canada’s left-leaning media""; ""It always strikes me as a little funny when the Liberals get all puffed up about Stephen Harper’s tactics... If they posture any harder, they are liable to snap in two""; ""Liberals get all flushed when you ask them about the times they did it – all full of hasty justifications and red-hot self defense""). She sees bias everywhere -- lumping the Economist with ""left-leaning media"", no less! -- and fails to even acknowledge her own obvious bias for the CPC. I see no less substance in my remarks than in her entire article.

And you have put up an arbitrary requirement that I read the comments section, refusing to allow me to criticize the article on its own. You call this ""required reading"", and claim that I cannot understand the article sufficiently to criticize it otherwise. This is the game you're playing: not disputing a particular point, but implying if I don't do what you demand, my views can be ignored. Not what you were saying? You might want to clarify the points you made in the last paragraph of your previous post, then.

Okay? Are we done here, then? Am I allowed to disagree with her article now?","1264989540"

I know that was their method of pacing the game, however, for whatever reason I spent 3/4 of the game with 1/5 heavy pistols.  This was supposed to be one of my main weapons as a vanguard, instead I had to use submachine guns to take down armor due to the severe lack of upgrades for the pistols.  

Due to the randomness of which quests you choose first, you can end up with a very random assortment of upgrades (not to mention missing a vital one).  

It's not the end of the world, but it started grating on me when I had my assault rifles maxed (which I couldn't use) and my pistols were sitting on the bottom rung.

Chances are, if there are mods done to it, the last owner drove it hard.

Turns out mine was a failed front mount intecooler and STi block swap, fucked something up, and had to have it fixed. Had stolen wheels, and the trunk/wing and front bumper were taken off a STi before it was repo'd (The color turned out to be wrong). All of these things the seller didn't know.

Don't let me scare you though, it looks like a SICK ride, and worth the 15k. I love my WRX, and it's an awesome car.

Saying someone is pro life however, implies that they value life, and pro-choicers don't. It twists the concept a little. It would be like calling pro choicers ""pro women"" instead of ""pro choice"".


I always found that ""pro life"" was a way to discredit the other side of the debate with sensationalism. Pro/anti choice is more equal. Calling somebody anti choice isn't about a lack of respect. It's simply the most neutral.

But expositive advertising is incredibly powerful, and it's funny that he started the article mentioning Microsoft, because Microsoft is my favorite advertising whipping boy. 

- Did you know that Zune has an ""all you can eat"" subscription music model?
- Did you know that Microsoft has an electronic forms application comparable to Acrobat?
- Did you know that there's a note-taking program that works well with tablets, but also with desktop PCs as kind of a ""junk storage"" for clippings, notes, etc?
- Did you know that you could send locations and routes straight from Bing Maps to Garmin GPS units?

I'm not talking about if these are things you want or would buy - just *did you even know they existed*? 

Techies and internet savvy folk joke about the Zune, but I figure most people either haven't heard of it, or have already forgotten about it. 

Steve Ballmer doesn't believe in advertising other than brand awareness. Steve Ballmer is a fucking idiot. You can't go an hour on network TV without seeing an Apple or Droid ad - does he really think he's smarter than Apple and Google combined?

Theravada, especially as it is practiced in southeast Asia has acquired some cultural baggage, but it is freer of those types of accumulations than the Mahayana or Tibetan traditions.

For instance in Mahayana buddhism,  Bodhisattvas are people who *could* achieve enlightenment and not return in after death in there next reincarnation, but choose to stay in order to help more people find enlightenment.  Searching for 'reincarnation' on Access to Insight brings up no results, which I think is a good sign for its focus.

Then there's zen, which is pretty free of well, everything.  But if it's rationality you are seeking, I'm not thinking you'll find it there.  You might be able to explore the limits of rationality however.

"funny","t5_2qh33","In a party context it absolutely is tacky and impolite to delve into politics to the point of asking someone to divulge a fact that is normally known to only a voter and their ballot box.

Certainly, as someone gets to know another person, they will probably feel free to share their voting preferences, but even then, it is far better for someone to feel comfortable enough to elect to share this information without the other person asking.

At a party, upon first meeting someone, to ask who they voted for is terribly impolite and rude. Any type of question that has the potential to make another person uncomfortable at a party should be avoided. Some other examples:

- What is your sexual orientation?
- Christians are assholes, don't you think?
- Dom or sub?
- Are you menstruating right now?
- When are you due? (before someone has said that they are pregnant)

I have a story about Northern Spanish firefighters, so I'll share it here.

On part of a long bicycle tour I was doing, I followed the Camino de Santiago since that's where I could meet other travelers in general.  This path runs across northern spain from the French border to the Atlantic.  One day I found myself in a small town somewhere between Bilbao and Burgos.  The sun had already set, so it was well past the time I should have set up my tent.  I found a nice large public space which was located right across from a fire station, so I decided to ask the firemen on the night-duty if they thought it would be okay if I set up my tent in the grassy area across the street.  

I thought they were going to tell me that I couldn't do it and that I should do it outside of the city area, but instead I got the warmest welcoming imaginable.  They insisted that I stay in their gym/training area, which was amazing since it was mid November and the nights were getting quite cold.  They gave me blankets, a sleeping bag, access to their showers and bathroom, everything I could imagine.

After they set me all up there, they invited me up to their hang out room, where they wait for the  calls that rarely come in at this time of night in such a small neighborhood.  There was a buffet style food station set up, which they gave me free access to, and some vino(which they didn't drink)

On my way out the next morning, the one who had originally insisted that I stay with them decided to cancel his visit to a friend(which he had scheduled in as time off), and ride his bike with me to the nearest mountain pass.  We made it there by around 2PM, he wrote me a message on a poleta(which he and another one had claimed they were some kind of national champs or something along those lines).  He was a cool dude, hope he's alright.

Drivers are the main reason that you get crashes in Windows - typically the drivers from the manufacturer (I'm looking at you ATI and Nvidia) are not certified and cause crashing once a week.  The drivers that are distributed through the Microsoft download site are ones that passed the tests and are much more reliable, even if they are older.

A lot of Windows and Mac users use these applications, because there are no alternatives available. However, when you step into the GNU/Linux world you do have options, numerous options, and we should be promoting that. In a sense promoting the culture of GNU/Linux where we have flexibility, user rights, fair use, and general freedoms that empower the user.

I hired an outside agency that did exactly this (as I mentioned elsewhere in this thread) and they made a couple of bad credit cards from when my business went bankrupt in the dotcom boom simply disappear from my credit.  My score went from about 550 to almost 700 in just over 4 months.

I was amazed at the tactics the banks would try.  My agency (I won't mention the name again) sent their well-worded legal demand for verification ... which included (if I remember correctly) my SSN, DOB, name, and that was it.  You'd think a bank should be able to pull up old records based on that in a jiffy ... right?

Apparently ... wrong.  *More often than not* **I** got a letter back from the bank (not addressed to my attorney working on my behalf, but to me) asking me to provide ""additional details"" about the inquiry, like what my previous account number was, what my address was, etc.  Basically, my legal counsel said *ignore it*.  It is not *my* responsibility to provide the banks with anything more than the bare minimum information required by law.  So, I ignored those letters.

Sure enough, the time intervals went by - and then the banks had to remove those marks from my credit.  They simply disappeared, as if they never happened.  Amazing.

Sounds like your process was much the same.  Good for you that you took it on yourself ... but the only point I would disagree with you on, is that there *are* reputable firms out there that will perform this service for a fee.  Just like I know how to change my own oil and do my own taxes, I prefer to pay professionals (mechanic, accountant) who know what they're doing to perform those services for me.  It doesn't mean they're a scam.

But yes, there are also a *lot* of scams ... so it definitely would be important to research things extremely thoroughly before engaging anyone on your behalf in regards to your credit.","1264989813"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was at this club and I saw this really cute pixie hippie girl chatting with an aquaintance of mine (barely knew the guy, really), who seemed to be quite into her, and she was reciprocating (as in, being VERY flirty).  I went to the smoking area for a cigarette, and started talking to some friends. A few minutes later she walked alone into the room.  Somehow we ended up talking.  Turned out she was single, the other guy wasn't her boyfriend and she's VERY forward when she is attracted to someone.  Lucky for me, she was more attracted to me than this other guy.  The conversation ended with us making out like crazy and then taking a cab to my place.  Yeah, kind of a dick move to steal a girl from someone else, but she was more interested in me, and it's not like the other guy was a friend.  Still glad that I did, the sex was great, even with the really WTF moment.

So we go to my place and get naked.  We're going at it, and after a little while I can feel her vagina start to tighten up, she says she's going to cum soon.  So I'm quite stoked about this, until she does cum.  When she does, she starts speaking IN TONGUES.  I mean, complete gibberish, like an alien language.  Screaming, actually.  In fact, now that I think about it, it kind of sounded like the language of that character Leeloo from ""The 5th Element"".  But she wasn't Milla Jovovich; if I was fucking Milla Jovovich and she started spouting Nazi propoganda at me when she came, I'd remain happy.

She screams this weird language for about 15 seconds or so, and I'm so speechless that I decide the best thing to do is to just keep fucking her and pretend that it didn't happen.  A few minutes later, she cums again, and once again starts yelling in this weird language.  When she calms down, I stop and ask her, tentatively, what language that was.  She looks at me, dead serious and says, ""It's elven."" 

""Oh, you mean like, Lord of the Rings?"" I reply, trying to put a little humor into the situation.  ""No,"" she says, ""Like ELVES.""  

Ohhhhhhh kay.  

Well, being a true gentleman, I don't kick her out, instead deciding to finish the deed (sans gibberish-cumming on my part), and pass out.  In the morning we have breakfast, hang out a bit more, and she leaves.  Turns out that she's WAAAY too hippy for my taste (crystals and chakras and belief in the ""forest children"" and such... I prefer more stoner- or techno-hippy girls).  So with that knowledge and the WTF moments from the sex the night before, I decide not to fool around with her again.

The best part?  About a year later, I'm at a bar and run into a friend, who is quite the cassanova: tall, good-looking, charming and well-off, he can pretty much get almost any girl.  We're talking about girls and eventually he asks me, in a bit of a nervous manner, if I know of a hippy girl of a certain name.  It's the same name.  I said yeah, I think I knew her, and he says that the weirdest thing had happened to him with this girl, and he had to tell someone about it.

Case A. It takes many years to be come an accomplished Music producer and hip hop artist. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzacv8dtb4 I suppose you think that  Someone Like Scratch Bastid learned how to do this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGl4DlfBvLA in a weekend. To me it makes me sad that you don't understand that people put in work. As much work as many people to master what they do. To make music. To make hip hop music. Which in some cases might be rap. In other cases might be something like this.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tlGwKi3k 

My case is this. While you may learn of a new hip hop artist they have probably already been producing music for at least 10 year. As a general rule of thumb most people when they have a hit. Are around their mid to late twenties. They start when they are young and finally make it . Now When you talk about Hip Hop don't get it confused with just rap. 

Hip hop there are five element of hip hop culture. DJing, Emceeing, Graffiti, Breaking, and Beat boxing. 



Rap is something you do. Hip hop is something you live. 

I actually don't expect you to read the rest of this post or to care about hip hop, but what I actually hope you do is take time to learn about it. It's more than what you think you know.

Saw the fucking point just fine. High ratio of cranks-to-Galileos. 

But there is a closely related counterpoint which I made. It is fallacious to assume that received wisdom is more accurate than those who question it. Valuing received wisdom more highly is the essential conservative argument, and there is strong reason to believe that it's wrong, since it appeals to authority and tradition rather than reason. And, with human nature being as change-averse as it is, it is dangerous to discourage those who are questioning the established order. By all means, use critical thinking to filter out the bullshit afterwards, but the appeal to authority is the technique that the priest, the authoritarian, and the know-nothing stifle debate.

And another way is by making ""way to miss the point"" cheap shots. You have hurt my delicate feelings with such insinuations, and I intend to spend the rest of the evening sulking.","1264990029"

Why? Because books are cheaper and have superior readability. This is easy to test, simply compare a book and an e-ink reader side by side. E-ink has poor contrast and poor resolution compared to a book. There are obvious anti-aliasing artifacts even on the best displays. The typeface in a modern hardcover, and even some paperbacks, is freakin' amazing.

Obama is not and never was the progressive he led us all to believe that he was!

There are any number of progressive changes he could have made by a stroke of the pen, without congress' approval, and he failed to do so.

&gt; The economic benefits of NASA's programs are greater than generally realized. The main beneficiaries (the American public) may not even realize the source of their good fortune. . .

For some specific numbers, I'd refer you to [NASA Budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Budget):

&gt; A November 1971 study of NASA released by the Midwest Research Institute of Kansas City, Missouri (""Technological Progress and Commercialization of Communications Satellites."" In: ""Economic Impact of Stimulated Technological Activity"") concluded that “the $25 billion in 1958 dollars spent on civilian space R &amp; D during the 1958-1969 period has returned $52 billion through 1971 -- and will continue to produce pay offs through 1987, at which time the total pay off will have been $181 billion. The discounted rate of return for this investment will have been 33 percent.”

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","About her:
&gt;Because of some of her personal issues she has never been in a relationship before

Look, she's got ""issues"" (probably having to do with intimacy), she's never been in a relationship before, and she's been your online gf for a month and a half?  Don't blame yourself, but it's very likely you were more than ready to begin the physical part, and she was downright scared of it.  
&gt;she barely reciprocated...
&gt;she doesn't enjoy affection and didn't even want to be touched or kissed by anyone.

If she's got issues, then she's got issues.  Don't blame yourself, and definitely don't feel led on. Comfort talking online is very different from comfort standing right next to someone.

About you:
&gt;I'm pretty devastated right now...I can still smell her perfume in my apartment and it's killing me.

I hear ya man.  We've all been there, or we will sometime in life.  It will eat you up inside if you let it.  I still have demons from past relationships haunting me, but you gotta move on.

I don't know the situation well enough, but from by my guess, it's possible you could still salvage it if you want to.  But you would have to talk to her hardcore about the things that bother her and be very understanding and take it slow.  In fact, she may not be receptive at all to opening up and you might end up with more heartache.


&gt;and my only relationship was so long ago and brief that it barely counts.

It is surprisingly easy to find ""nice"" cars for not a lot of money, but you have to remember they are cheap for a reason.  That reason is that with the insurance rates, the oil and tires that last only a few thousand miles, and the 15 MPG gas consumption, it makes very little sense to drive these cars unless you are rich, so there is not much market for selling them.  In general, the amount of maintenance required for a car goes up with the performance level.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Are you sure your grandmother never slaughtered them? I have friends who grew up on farms whose parents would tell them that (insert animal here) ""died"" when really they were slaughtered. If not, she had pet chickens, but (no matter how small scale) they are still inefficient and bad for the environment. They feed off of grains and the land that the grain is grown on could be much more efficiently used to grow crops for human consumption.

You're talking about having 2 animals per daily egg (hen and rooster) -- they both put energy into standing, walking, breathing, chewing, fluttering around, pecking, scratching at the dirt, and other natural behaviors. They both need a steady supply of fresh water. They both excrete waste and put energy into building bones, organs and muscle tissue. You're only getting back an egg a day if you're lucky --  a small fraction of what you put in (food and water). And this is only for about half of the hen's life, then you're giving food away and getting nothing back. That's not symbiotic. That's wasteful.

And also, where did your grandmother get her first hens and roosters? Unless they were rescued, they're sourced from a system that perpetuates cruelty. Purchasing them is much the same logic as someone buying a puppy from a pet store because it looks sad in a cage -- you're merely allowing more puppies to be put into the same situation.

Lastly, you criticize large-scale operations but that fact is that we live in a world with 6+ billion people. Small scale simply does not work in many areas, and the areas in which it does, you can bet that they'll be slaughtering the animal for food when it stops laying eggs.

If people continue to eat animal products, even decentralized small operations will have an environmental impact. If you're suggesting that everyone move to this model, the total environmental impact would be WORSE, not better. The amount of energy needed to produce an egg would be 4x as much as it is currently.

Transportation of the final actually accounts for very little of a food's footprint. Look at the life of an egg, from the soil for the grain to transporting the grain to the inefficient egg-producing pets. The land where those chickens are living could without a doubt be more productive, carbon-friendly and efficient with beans or fruit/nut trees growing on it.","1264990278"

One guy from the crowd yelled, ""Read Matthew 10:14."" and then someone else began yelling it too. After a bit the preacher announced, ""I will read Matthew 10:14"" and began turning to it. He held his bible up to his face and read, ""If any household or town refuses to welcome you or listen to your message, shake its dust from your feet as you leave."" The people cracked up and the guy stood there in shock. Everyone started clapping and chanting ""10:14, 10:14.""

tl;dr: [Matt. 19:5 actually is part of a reply to a question that representatives of the establishment asked Jesus in order to entrap him. That question was whether a man can divorce his wife.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:3-12&amp;version=KJV) If Jesus' reply to that question is evidence of Jesus being anti-gay, then talking politics at /r/politics has to count as proof that one hates programming.  
Actually, it's less of a huge stretch to extrapolate a pro-gay attitude from Matt. 19:11-12 than it is to extrapolate an anti-gay attitude from Matt. 19:5.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Gigantic wall of text inc:

I recommend Survival as a DPS spec, though MM is viable with higher quality (ToC-25 or above) epics. BM is kinda lagging fairly behind, and is too reliant on pet damage

Hunters should **only** focus on Attack Power, Agility, Hit Rating, Crit Rating, Armor Penetration, and possibly a tiny amount of Haste if you're not Beast Mastery. BM Hunters scale best from Attack Power, so gem for that. This is because that is the only stat apart from Stamina, Hit and Resilience your pets actually scale on. MM Hunters scale best from Agility and Armor Penetration, as a lot of their damage is physical, and SV Hunters scale best with Agility, due to AP gains from Expose Weakness and +15 - 18% Agility from talents

As for rotations, remember they are **PRIORITY BASED** meaning you use abilities in order of highest to lowest priority (until the higher priority skills are off their cooldown of course)

* **For BM:** Bestial Wrath - Aimed/Multi Shot - Arcane Shot - Serpent Sting - Steady Shot.

* **For MM:**
Serpent Sting (only apply once) - Chimera Shot - Aimed/Multi Shot - Arcane Shot - Steady Shot

* **For Survival with 3/3 Noxious Stings:**

Serpent Sting - Black Arrow - Explosive Shot - Aimed/Multi Shot - Steady Shot

* **For Survival without 3/3 Noxious Stings:**

Black Arrow - Explosive Shot - Aimed/Multi Shot - Serpent Sting - Steady Shot

As for talents, I'd recommend searching for popular Hunter PvE builds. Or check out some of the other comments here, they're giving good advice on Hunter talent builds.","1264990301"

High school was a completely different experience, I came out as gay fairly early (14? I think), which i have heard is quite weird for a masculine gay man.

It hardly says that ""doctors were amazed at his ability to converse on advanced concepts"".  It basically says Jesus disobeyed his parents, ran off for three days, and was found in a temple talking to the religious teachers.   Whoop-de-doo.   You don't think temple clergy would talk to a lost kid?  I think they would, and they probably taught him a fair bit of dogma if he were there for three days, that his parents might be ""amazed"" at.

It was something like that. Very ecstatic and appreciative. Just by spending a tiny bit of time and effort to post a link on a BBS, I managed to help someone's brother avoid a major problem that, most likely, would've had lasting psychological damage for years, maybe even decades.

Where do you propose we cut money from, if we are running a deficit? Bear in mind that we were in a deficit even before the Olympics. It doesn't help that we are in a so called economic downturn... The idea is to limit spending so that entire programs don't need to be scrapped.

Trust me, the way some hospitals and schools are run, they could use a little more efficiency... (not saying there won't be a negative impact on things, because there probably will be, but you as a citizen are not going to see a major difference).

The major cuts are to arts funding, and this is quite sad because they took a 81% cut, but don't try to blame this on the Olympics. This has to do with tax breaks for corporations and corruption at that level and nothing to do with the Olympics. 

Like I said earlier, the system is broken, and a lot of things were highlighted. Hopefully, we as BC citizens and Canadians speak up about this. But venting about a broken system and trying to link it to something that doesn't really have anything to do with it, is silly.","1264990427"

It's an unrealistically positive portrayal of a horrible situation. It shows these little girls having problems that magically get cured thanks to their love and devotion to their baby. The show never shows that most teen moms end up leading difficult and unsatisfying lives. It glorifies a bad situation. 

Here is an analogy. 

A show that portrayed the lives of two people. a 14 year old and a 20 year old. They are in love [for realz] Despite the fact that their tragic love is illegal and frowned upon, they fight their parents, friends, and naysayers. They prove to everyone that 14 year olds and 20 year olds can be happy and in love...and they all lived fluffy, cute lives until the end of their days.


I imagine that 16 and Pregnant and Teen Moms is watched by a lot of young women dating their first boyfriend. They are convinced that they will be married. They see a show like this and get excited about growing up fast. These shows are a serious problem. Either they need to show the reality of teenage motherhood, or they need to stop producing these shows. ","1264990510"

No one denies that, _on average_, black families are poorer than white families and live in poorer neighborhoods.  This affects the educational opportunities available to black children, since schools and extracurricular programs are primarily funded through local taxes.  Poor children of all races, even smart ones, don't do as well on standardized tests and have less of an opportunity to develop an extracurricular resume than wealthy ones.  Since being black and being poor correlate to some degree, this lack of opportunity affects black children far more than white children.

Say you're picking between two sprinters to make a track team.  One candidate runs with perfect, well-coached form, and another candidate has never been coached and has terrible form.

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","I think about physics.  These high notes aren't particularly illuminating or even directed towards a real point, but I still think it's a pretty good way to think about the world we live in.

&gt; maybe everything we experience as reality is a collapsed wavefunction.  it is not us that does the collapsing any more than any other part of the universe, and the collapse depends largely on chance.  However, in a majority of cases, where the collapse is non-independent, meaning that each individual particle's most probable location is a spike in its waveform.  Classical mechanics is an approximation of this where the height of the spike reaches 100%.  Quantum mechanics is only necessary when the probability of a particle's location is great enough to cause appreiable differences from classical approximations.  This also explains entropy, which probably also has to do with movement across potential barriers; we see electrons tunneling through potential barriers because of the uncertainty involved in their location.  At larger scales, the waveform is more locally defined and so we rarely see quantum weirdness like that; planets don't tunnel out of orbits and people don't tunnel out of the atmospheres because there are too many factors that collapse their wavefunction.  Thus the classical worlds of chemistry, biology, and computing have been able to use the approximations of classical physics (with the occasional bits of quantum thrown in) to solve all sorts of complicated problems and describe more complicated things.  But physics was forced, for the most part, to drop into quantum mechanics, as the uncertainties became big enough to render completely unintelligible our previous assumptions.  There may come a time when quantum physics informs quantum computing, chemistry, and even biology.  In any case, the important bit is that a high enough percentage of things that we experience can be described classically","1264990546"

And—here's that sticky phrase again—my opinion is that King's characters are more true to life and vibrant than most. His characterization is wonderful. 

He does some things poorly. He has a tendency to rush his endings and to go for pathos (and *deus ex machina*) over substance. But I disagree that his flaws override his strengths, and I do not feel that a writer's genre should be taken into consideration when judging his talent.

I, personally, think that socialism is an ideology that has implications for areas much broader than just the economy.
EDIT: **That is, what socialism dictates necessitates a certain power structure: one that is, for one, not totalitarian in nature. In this sense, I think it's fair to oppose socialism with totalitarianism.**

In any case, the economy present in the USSR in no way resembled a socialist economy. For one, most wealth was owned by handful of oligarchs, party leaders (or whatever you wish to call them) who masqueraded as Communists, as opposed to a socialist economy which would require equal access to wealth for the entire society.

Additionally, I use Maxxis Ardents on one of my bikes and Maxxis Hookworms on another and am very pleased with the quality of Maxxis tires. I use Kendas on my Faith and can recommend them as well.  
I'm curious if the rear suspension has a lockout, which doesn't exactly work 100% to keep the rear rigid, but it's better than a simple Fox Float R, which is what one of my bikes has. If so, that may be something to play with.  
If I might, after living in the Pacific Northwest for years, suggest more than keeping it clean and the chain lubed. I started doing my own maintenance years ago and found that disassembling the bottom bracket every six months or so to relube the cups, bearings and spindle with grease was well worth the time. There's nothing more irritating than a creaky bottom-bracket. Air eventually creeps out of the rear shock, so check that once in awhile also.

Sooo...  you needed $100k to get out of jail.  You pay the bail bond place $15k and they put up $100k to the jail? So the bail bond place gets $15k, then if you show up to the court date, they get their $100k back.  Is that correct?  Since you didn't show up, the bail bond place is out $85k.  Several people in this thread were saying ""oh, don't worry.. the bail bond place doesn't have to pay out $100k"" -- but they DID have to pay that for you to get out, yes?

So.. back to Dog the Bounty Hunter...  this bail bond place has their own guys, or hires out somebody like Dog, to look for you???  And then if Dog finds you and brings you in, the jail municipality gives the $100k back to the bail bond place... and the bail bond place gives a portion of this $100k to Dog.

This is an interesting piece of advice. It seems to assume that the words of the Buddha Shakyamuni were the pinnacle of the teachings, even though they were uttered more than two thousand years ago by a person living in a radically different culture.

If a person asked in /r/science for Newton's laws of motion, chances are that nobody would recommend him to read the original, even though it was written only a few centuries ago by somebody in a culture that is much closer. Instead, people would point him at modern, current, accounts that explain the same ideas in a more readable way.

Is it possible that modern living teachers may be able to explain the ideas of buddhism better than the originals? In addition, has Buddhism not advanced at all in the last two thousand years of monks studying the scriptures and practicing meditation? These are honest questions.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Thanks for the comment spo, I appreciate your engagement with me and my discourse. 

The limit to practical reason thing is a response to Heidegger and the Nazis, who so fatefully utilized this notion reasonable logic upon their own sense of modernity. 

I fear that our country is in the same position to be exploited en masse by such fundamental ideology... In the same manner that Nazis justified purification for notions of social health.

It is interesting that it is now a topical argument, how the World Banking Cartel including the prominent Bush pushed Hitler into power; They believed the same things he preached and wanted to pursue a society built on scientific purity from the ground up.

This vision is quixotically what FDR fought against and at the same time succumbed to...

Anyways, post Nazi fascist social-efficiency experimentalism... Has the world learned anything?  

I think the Global Power elite have. And that is that there is a limit to *practical* reason, different from *possible* reason.

To picture Today as a performance spectacle only seems fitting, and the assertion is that ""reason"" is to be undermined through much more insidious, and increasingly panoptic means. 

The irrelevant practice of reason, aka madness, has its own unique history... And today it has been built into something to fear and control, instead of a tolerated part of human existence. 

It goes beyond a zeitgeist however. You will be interested in Foucault, who essentially opened up discourse on power and knowledge relations, much as Marx opened up the novel force of industrial capital and its relational structures for critique.

The world has been living in anarchy for a long time and the nation state is a comforting myth for economists and politicians to coral people into something which is simply *knowable*. 

Corporations have since picked up this war on space, and knowledge, and have accelerated our progress as a race exponentially, see Technocalypse... My problem, as is everyone's, is that such ""power"" is under lock and institutional key, and belongs to no one other than the global capital class, as are the mechanisms of protection for such knowledge, through institutional process and governance, for which people are happy to play a part.

However,
It's theirs, not ours which is the fundamental distinction I would like to draw, and would like to research... However such power has and will continue to be challenged. Open networks and software are good examples, however they are known about, aggregated, and as a security threat to such positional powers analyzed. The internet was, given, and its power to be exploited scarcely realized. I love the community of hackers that enabled my own anarchical/pirating consumption since I began on the internet, enjoying their labor more than anyone else's. I lament I will perhaps never join such a community, and am only now thinking about how to help such freedom of expression information process and telescoping this space into the geographic material world.  

The difficulties now are so extreme! I think back to Jefferson and Franklin, who could explore the world as novelty from their positions of power and leisure sowed out of the land. They were pirates, they were free, especially from the Bankers of London and they aimed to keep it that way, and our history since has been marked most detrimentally by the re-assertion of such a class into writing a history of extractive profit and tyrannical war upon humanity. 

Remember,

They are and have been dominant. 

Everybody clap for militaristic Keynesianism. Everybody. The logic that supports their terror today is as totalizing as ever. And the world outside of it's grasp the enemy, as long as they can make us believe so. 

Personal efficacy should be easy it should come naturally and people are always open to it, they simply must be freed of such immaterial, ideological bondage before they can do so... I wish to think that everyone is capable, however this will to knowledge is a difficult thing to grasp, and the Elite have been trying to do so, to unlock a singularity of economy and thought, but from us. It is this distinction which I think leads to the structural problems of the day, how to keep us productive, as the engine begins to self realize, and as  individuals crumple at the margins while the drones become the objects of institutional success. 

Think here of the dominance of the fairer sex within our institutional and educational economies. Kant remarked that they, as a gender, are without the capacity for true self awareness. I am inclined to agree, at least they don't feel the pain... or are better able to cope and ""reason"" with it.

"wow","t5_2qio8","That is more than acceptable for Naxx. You'd be around Ulduar quality as well since raid buffed is more significant than heroic 5 man buffed.

25 man has larger DPS requirements compared to 10 man, and rarely some slightly different boss tactics depending on boss (e.g. Instructor Razuvious 10 and 25 man in Naxxramas.) The DPS requirements per player are higher to make up slightly for both superior gear in 25 mans and the larger access to raid buffing.

A good place to find boss tactics, which are very important to succeeding in raids is the [TankSpot Project Marmot Video Raidguides](http://www.tankspot.com/forumdisplay.php?206-Project-Marmot-TankSpot-Raid-Movie-Guides) which work for all raiders, not just tanks, and have been known to explain tactics very well for bosses.

Also, if you haven't yet, **Learn your class.** This is crucial for maximising DPS, and it doesn't hurt to ask more experienced players for advice on maximising damage output. Also, Elitist Jerks have some good info on Rogue dps specs, rotations, glyphs, gear and how to maximise output with that.

However, I seriously suggest working your way up the Trial of the Champion normal/heroic and ICC 5-man normal/heroic ladder, as you can get some good Naxx to Trial of the Crusader quality epics there, as well as Emblems of Triumph. Keep this up, and you'll be geared for ToC-10/25 and possibly Icecrown Citadel raids in little time.","1264990868"

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","&gt;Using your argument then it is fair to call the other side pro-abortion. Or do you not see that aspect of the argument?


That doesn't make sense. Pro abortion would imply that you support the concept of abortion. Many pro choicers dislike abortion, but believe that people deserve a choice. 

However, anti choicers disagree with abortion being legal all together. There is no grey area. 

&gt;Let's put this in another format. If I am against murder, am I anti-choice or anti-murder?
They believe that abortion is killing a baby. They may, or may not, be correct. But that is what they believe. They aren't against choice. They are against abortion.

What motivates someone isn't important. When naming groups, most people want to give the most to the point explanation they can. That's why we have naming systems like ""pro deathy penalty, and anti death penalty"", instead of ""anti killing prisoners"", and ""pro justice"". 

Motivation isn't what is important here. The basics are...and the basics  are that anti choicers diagree in a woman's right to an abortion, and pro choicers support it. Simple, equal, and to the point. 

More importantly, why should be be giving one party a sensationalist name and the other something more relaxed. If ""pro life"" is a fair term for anti choicers, ""anti life"" should be fair for anti choicers. It's not because it's sensationalist.

It had been decided a couple years ago to move most of the Marines to Guam, but that seems to have come to a halt, I believe to the heavy costs of infrastructure improvements that were to be footed by the Japanese government.  The funny thing about Futenma is that it is an extremely slow-paced airfield, only capable of handling light cargo planes; the transient F-18s and Harriers always stay over in Kadena.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p",". . . imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, ‘This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn’t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!’ This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it’s still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything’s going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.

I went through a bad situation with a depressed, probably bipolar alternating crazy girl housemate and it was heartbreaking and terrible and depressing; one of the worst situations of my life.

Sometimes you have to wonder if all of that emotional cost is worth it. You need to look out for yourself and make sure you are alright first, and not let someone drag you down into a bad space. You said you have been there before and being around someone like this might drag you back down again....if they arent much of a friend and just some guy you live with, is it really going to be worth it?

I know this is odd advice because i am basically telling you to not worry about him and cut your losses because he is not a close friend and this is coming from suicidewatch where everyone is a stranger who cares about other random strangers.

So you should do what you can for him, but dont get so deep that you cant get out again. Know where your line is, offer to talk to him sure, offer some friendly gestures e.g pizza, but dont be dragged down with him...try and contact his friends [if u can find out if he has any] or relatives....this kind of stuff is more their problem.","1264991096"

What you did was make Red the color of ""BAD STUFF"", and Green the color of ""GOOD STUFF"". By making religiousness red, you have automatically biased the graph to make it look like religiousness is bad.

If you still don't believe that it is causing a bias, try switching it and making high religiousness GREEN, and making low religiousness RED. All of a sudden, the graphic makes atheism look bad.

Really? You can't conceive of any barriers to entry besides violence? Huge infrastructure investment requirements? Lack of access to necessary rights of way? The threat of dumping while the large corporations are large and can absorb it and the upstart is small and can't?

&gt;So the 52% of federal tax money (in the US) that goes to military expenses is a reflection of the public will?

No, it's a reflection of the corruption of government by for-profit private companies who found it was easier to make money that way than by competing in a free market.

&gt;Large companies cannot buy power from a government that doesn't exist, and large companies cannot exclude other companies from the market without the threat of violence.

It would be equal to have 210 spots for everyone if Maori were equally represented socio-economically, as well as educationally (ie: poor results in high school etc). Whilst its easy to argue that Maori students should just ""do better"", its not always that easy. The effect of poverty, or being poor in a relative sense, makes it very hard to achieve well scholastically. For example, if your parents are poor you will live in a poor neighborhood and attend a poorer school. Chances are you wont do as well as someone who is living in a very affluent area and has books, stationary, tuition etc all provided for them. You dont get to go to uni because your family cannot afford it (or you dont have the results), so you use your high school education, if you even have one, to get a poor paying job. Have kids, cycle repeats itself. 

By introducing the ability to provide free tuition or extra spots to students who make a real effort and come from a less than privileged background, the governments aim with this policy is to try and break that cycle. It may not be perfect, and relies heavily upon the individual to make the right choices and such; but its better than nothing.

&gt; Treating people differently based upon their genetic ancestry is wrong, no matter how benevolent the intentions behind the policy.

The problem was, this is exactly what happened previously. Look up the policies of assimilation and integration adopted by the European government. 

The major issue people dont seem to get it that Maori are not guaranteed a spot in the course. They still have to have the required academic results too. It is simply designed to allow additional students into the course who historically do not often get into these courses. Its designed to help alleviate the disparity between Maori and Pakeha incomes/living conditions (for lack of a better term) etc. 

Its fine to argue for equality, but be sure to remember how European settlers treated the Maori, as well as the subsequent government policies imposed, and ask yourself if that could have any future consequences. 

If we want to go to extremes, Pakeha are now the victims of racism. Just be glad you're not being shot, or given diseases, or having your land taken. :)

We searched around in the water for a few minutes, but eventually my buddy admitted, ""man, they are gone. forget about em.""

Easier said than done, as I'm pretty blind without em, and I didn't have any contacts with me.  I was pretty sure my vacation was ruined.   

About an hour later, we're walking along a different part beach, knee deep in the water and he's giving me a hard time, describing all the pretty girls that I can't see.   Then he steps on something..""what the hell?""..reaches down into the water at his feet, and comes up with my glasses, completely intact.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Africa has billions of acres of unused land. That can easily hold us until lab production reaches a point that it becomes a more efficient use of the land. 

I understand that Africa has billions of ""unused"" land.  I'm greatly bothered by that term and take serious issue with your choice of the word ""unused"".  The land is being used, it's just not being used for us (the greater industrial world)  Now arguably that *unused* land *could* be used better for the local population, but that's not at  issue - this about feeding the outside world.  

Since history is a good indicator of future behavior, it's safe to assume corporate use of this land will come at a great local cost.  The cost of **using** that land will have real adverse consequences and also raises serious moral issues.  

In short, I see this not as teaching a man to fish with a better fiberglass fishing pole but taking away his bamboo fishing pole and paying him to turn the fiberglass fishing pole's reel; in effect casting the local farmer as a mere cog in the corporate machine which serves not local society but international market masters.  

Concerns &amp; Issues:

* not if, but when there is a famine in the host farm country - will the corporation continue to export the food that they and the industrialized world need?  

* Local farmers who are in most instances are *in balance* with the land and the environment (eg ""small impact"") are now left to suck the tit of the high impact corporation which will affect their environment.  We've witnessed what this did to Mexican farming which partly explain US illegal immigration.  If you destroy a local economic ecosystem - the consequences are felt in very predictable ways.

* Because of foreign interests, which some of those interests may become hostile (due to economics, military challenge...most likely food/water shortages), Africa will again be ripe for corruption and proxy wars.  (See Cold War)

* in order to survive, local populations will work for foreign interests that do not have local interests in mind (outside of cheap labor and the land that will now be **used** to feed the world outside)  Think Nigerian oil riots times 10.  When that occurs... it's dictator time.

* take a look at the consequences of IMF / World Bank policy that opens markets to free trade.  More often than not those deals have stipulations that flood markets with corporate food at initially low prices which therein destroys local farming economies (see my mention of Mexican farming above).  When commodity prices rise, and they will, local populations, now almost exclusively importing food, are in peril (see Haiti).  Essentially slaves to a system they have no hope of entering. 


In summary, cloaked in the spirit of altruism, good science and making better use of *unused* land, economic colonialists (the newest venture of the oligarchy) is about to make a pile of money.","1264991362"

"programming","t5_2fwo","+1:  Perl is known as the write once, read never language.  Larry Wall modeled perl on natural languages in some tricksy ways:  implied objects (the grammatical kind), contractions, etc.  This means that you can write very concise code, but figuring out what you meant 6 months later can be a huge pain.

I started with perl, then switched to python later, and like ruby a little more when I don't have to write python for a living.

ESR once said that python works hard to avoid violating the principle of least surprise:  Once you know a little python, your guess as what syntax might be for a new construct is generally right.  I think ruby goes even further in this direction.

The thing that can drive some people nuts about python is the indentation indicating block structure.  I happen to like this, as I worked on a lot of COBOL that had nicely indented if statements that just happened to not fit the actual logic!  

Indentation always suggests structure, that's why there are style guides that emphasize using it.  Python takes it farther and actually uses indentation to indicate structure.

Hope this helps.","1264991478"

Doubtful.  While Rumsfeld enjoyed playing up the threat of the Yellow Peril, the Chinese military does have a long way to go before it can become an effective **offensive** force.  They have loads of troops and weapons, but would be unable to send them to Taiwan, let alone Japan or some other overseas destination.

So far, it appears that China's primary focus in its modernization has been on defence and assymitrical forces to deter attack from stronger (ie, the US) militaries.  Japan has little to fear until China develops an effective blue water navy.","1264991507"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","How to use tracer darts:

1.  When placing a dart, the gun has a limited range, so it won't work from far away. You must also account for bullet drop.

2. Locking on to darts: Use the scope on your RPG. Keep the aimer on the orange square until it stops flashing. (Tip: You can do this from behind cover where the tank can't see you, you only need the orange square) Once the square stops flashing, you are locked on. Immediately aim your RPG into the air, and fire. You will see the rocket change direction rather sharply, and go towards the target. Kaboom.

3. For the love of god, if I put a tracer dart on an enemy helicopter, blow the damn thing up!","1264991558"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Jesus died on the cross as a scapegoat for our sins; but you have to believe in him in order to benefit. Original sin still exists, but--unlike before Jesus--you can get out of it by ""knowing Jesus"". The theology/rules of it get really convoluted because in Judaism there is no heaven or hell in the Christian sense, at least.

Basically, because of Eve's transgression, all human souls are damned from the outset, and only repentance and belief in Jesus as the savior and son of God can eradicate that sin. Beforehand, all you had to do was keep Kosher, as it were. Basically, Jesus didn't erase sin, but gave us an out if we want it. 

If you believe in that kind of thing.

A really great illustration of this theological problem Is The Last Temptation of Christ by Nikos Kazantzakis. The movie is pretty good, too, but mostly focuses on Jesus' man-god duality.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Some relevant bits of recent Church history: the Church actively supported military dictatorships in South America (particularly Chile and Argentina), even as these were brutalising people in the name of ""anti-communism"".

The Church's opposition to communism trumped any ideas they claimed to have had about loving your neighbour.  In Argentina during 1976-1983, for instance, those renegade priests that took sides with ordinary people were ""disappeared"" by the government - meanwhile the Church bureaucracy maintained a deafening silence.  Simultaneously, the Church supplied priests to read victims their last rites as they were clandestinely executed.  They also used confessions to report people to the government.  They did this even as the government was denying any knowledge of the ""disappeared"".

Naively, human rights delegations were sent to the Vatican to speak to the Pope and alert him to what was happening.  The Pope did not even make himself available to them.

I had the misfortune of living in Argentina during that dark time.

edit: Note that, contrary to government propaganda, it was later discovered that the victims were *not* communists, but union leaders, intellectuals, teachers, journalists, lawyers that opposed the government.  The massacre grew to such levels where victims were ""disappeared"" not for their political views, but for their property - this was then handed out to the captors.  The government denied that illegal arrests were taking place, accusing the relatives of the victims (particularly mothers) of being insane.  The Church was well aware of all this, and did not say a word - but maintained their support of the government, claiming that their hard line approach was a necessary evil to ""root out communism"".","1264991597"

Yet, as a civilization, as a world - we're really bad at it. Obviously, religion is not providing this support, or else we'd see a much better planet.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","no, manufacturing and mining releases carbon.  there's a fuckton of oil in the ground.  that's carbon in it's most sequestered form.  using carbon is not good unless it uses atmospheric carbon.  that's what carbon sequestration is: taking atmospheric carbon and turning it into earthbound carbon.  if manufacturing plastic took carbon out of the air, it would be good.  but manufacturing takes carbon from the ground, releases some to the air via burning fuel to run the processes and puts some in the plastic.  

our problem right now is we've taken too much carbon out of it's naturally sequestered form, screwed up our planet, and now we're trying to fix it by putting the carbon back into the ground.  sequestering carbon is a good thing, but not taking it out of the earth in the first place is even better.  recycling enables us to extract less carbon from the earth.

so to be clear:
   
* releasing carbon to the air: bad
* taking carbon out of the air: good
* converting one form of earthbound carbon to another: probably releases some to the air

The flight details were unrealistic. On smaller corporate jets, the flight crew, being the only crew, are much more involved with the passengers. You get to know them well, so instead of ""the plane landed"", your friends and fellow travelers landed the plane.

Saga as far as that goes did great, because it made ranged characters much more worth it than melee (because you never see anyone but Jedi rush out into melee combat) and made armor worthless to a real heroic character (because you never see Han Solo in armor, and he's never hit by stormtroopers). The roleplaying bits are really just up to you to determine, and how much you want to roll in situations. My lack of experience with other systems colors my opinion, of course, but I feel that as long as a system is balanced for all types and doesn't bog the player down in rules (which is another relative, of course) it's perfect for whatever you want to do.","1264991845"

The human brain is extremely adept at learning, in childhood, whatever a serious and sincere-sounding adult tells it.

Extend this over centuries, and you get legislators who prohibit the teaching of evolution until high school, and then only with caveats. Foolishness. Those of us who manage to escape this pattern of ignorance and really investigate our world, and the published scientific works, well enough to understand them, are left gaping in amazement at how ignorant the rest of the country is.

1. at soccer practice I was talking to a teammate and kicked a ball at my head (he was about 110° from my center of vision) and for some reason I ducked at the last second and it hit the guy who i was talking to right in the stomach. He failed to tell me about the kick and got what he had coming.

2. I was signing a yearbook at school in grade 12 and someone behind me and to the left yelled over asking if I wanted their granola bar. I was a starving student even in highschool because I lacked the morning capabilities to pack a lunch so I said sure. He threw the bar and without turning my head or stopping from signing the book I lifted up my left leg and as the bar hit my leg, I lowered it with the bar to dampen the landing and it stayed on my calf! Peripheral vision + dumb luck ftw.

3. I was in shanghai taking pictures of the city over the waterway and for whatever reason I swung my hand under the camera and caught the lens cover as it was about to fall into the waterway below. no idea what made me do it or how it happened.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Hey, you might be right about Chicago, I dunno (I've been there and remember pretty good trains though).  I definitely would agree that local train service is essential--if you get off the high speed train and have to get into a car, there really isn't all that much point.  And though there's a bit of a chicken and egg thing to overcome in getting people out of cars (in that it takes years for the retail and residential building culture to react to the new reality), it's cheaper and more sensible to build local trains first.  In any case, I won't accept that just because you buy a house in one suburban car-only town, work in another, then shop in yet another, that you can pollute the air for everyone around you and then act cheated if your neighbors try to do something about the situation. Yes, high-speed rail will make the areas close to the stops much more valuable and encourage people to live in denser areas where they use less energy.

&gt; travel by car/bus FROM a suburban office TO a downtown trail depot and then FROM another downtown train depot back OUT by car/bus to another suburban business area

  Yes, but it's this lifestyle of driving from suburb to suburb that must eventually all-but-disappear (with or without the trains, as oil gets more expensive). What actually happens in countries and areas with good trains is that retail and office space gets built along convenient train lines &amp; hubs (usually private industry builds the local trains, and loses money on the trains themselves but more than makes up for it by buying up land, building the line, then selling the real-estate along the line, as well as running department and grocery stores at the hubs. This happened in America as well, e.g. in LA, until the automobile industry bought and destroyed the train lines). There are some nasty zoning laws in most places in the US that make this very difficult.

&gt; Most trains are DIESEL.
 
Both the Shinkansen and TGV are fully electric. Even for Diesel locomotives (almost all of which are actually [Diesel Hybrids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_locomotive#Diesel-electric)--i.e., they actually use an electric motor for propulsion but a Diesel engine to provide electricity and/or recharge batteries), the fact is trains are so much more energy efficient (because of the low friction of rails, very little need to worry about weight in engine design, constant speed, and regenerative braking) that the pollution / person is irrelevant compared to cars and (esp.) planes. 

Yes, Nuclear power produces waste, but that waste isn't yet a huge problem in the way that CO2 and smog are. It uses up Uranium, but that also isn't the kind of problem yet that oil has become. Overall, it's a much better source of power at least until viable alternatives are developed (which I personally think will turn out to be geothermal. We'll see.).

Safety is another issue. Nobody would allow cars to be sold if these things were invented today. I think our media does us a great disservice by all-but ignoring the massive personal cost of automotive deaths.","1264991955"

There's been more than a few times when their articles trying to show how popular something is convinced me that it's actually not at all popular at the moment. ","1264991994"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Bad Company 2 is much better in my opinion. BC2 is extremely strategic, and it requires you, your squad, and the whole team to work together to win the game. If you're not communicating  with your squad, it would be difficult to achieve your goal. You can't just focus on your kill count, you have to focus on where you place your squadmates and where your squad directs it's attack/defense. Also, the vehicles, different classes and types of weapons mixes up into a very tactically challenging experience. All the big guns, and the countermeasures to said big guns requires you to adapt yourself to the enemy's tactics. Also, the different frontiers to battle(Heli-choppers, Tanks, Boats, etc.) on give you a lot more diversity in which route and which insertion method to take which can lead to some interesting encounters. One thing I enjoy about the game the most is that kills are always fair. I never get killed in BC2 and think ""That was total bullshit"". In MW2, on the other hand, I could write a FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU for every time I die. Additionally, the game is very immersive, with the HDR dampening sounds after an explosion and making your ears ring, it makes you feel like your actually controlling your character. Also, with the other game types coming in the final game, it'll only be even better. Whether your going on a stealthy insertion or repairing vehicles as an Engineer, covering your squad as a sniper, being on the front lines with an assault rifle, getting your whole squad in a Blackhawk and mowing down infantry(which is an awesome experience), or running around defibrillating your teammates as a medic, your bound to have fun playing this game. Also, all of my positive feedback comes from only playing the demo, which could say something. (BTW, I think it is better graphic wise and sound wise) Lastly, with all the things that people complain about in MW2, it just does not compare. I enjoyed MW2 for a while, but when BC2 comes out, MW2 will be gathering dust for a while.

EDIT: The one thing I absolutely despise about BC2, is the fact that they added a kill-cam, it's my only complaint. But I do like that fact that they made it so that if you teabag someone, they'll see it in the kill-cam.

There, that's my two cents.","1264991999"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Government *can*, when applied poorly, exacerbate any problem. Those on the left side of spectrum (like myself) would do well to keep this in mind always.

Some of us do understand that much of the policy schemes we come up with amount to an imposition. We are, I think, nonetheless certain that there exists a public good that should be expressed in the rules we design for ourselves as a society. I would love to see libertarians stop arguing about the philosophical underpinnings of government, and start using the policy we have every right to create in the aid of the less fortunate...even if its something like charter schools or the one realm where we agree: Foreign policy and the pursuit of peace. 

Either way, I think the reflexive focus on never ever ever admitting a regulation or tax has a legitimate use helps no one, even libertarians themselves. It makes brushing you aside easy. We just label you as unable to negotiate in good faith and largely an unreasonable lot. Not that that's fair, but this is politics.","1264992014"

"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","You are a bigot because you refuse to discuss specific. If freethought is just a bunch of people talking in a high-level of abstraction then there is no truth to be found. You refuse to talk about specifics because specific examples require more effort than you are capable of. You continue to straw-man my every position. 

&gt;Coase's theorem also applies somewhat, but it relies on certain assumptions which do not always hold true.

LOOK AT WHAT I WROTE. I wrote that Coase's theorem does not apply everywhere, because it's fucking reality. Not some discussion taking place at a high-level of abstraction, which is the level you insist on taking. Notice this straw-man. You keep on making arguments to things I did not state. 

&gt;Yea, that's because you're picking-and-choosing tiny examples out of context to desperately try and prove your point.

What you want is not possible, because you insist that any movement toward the future need demonstrable examples of it beforehand. That is to say, democracy must be perfected before it can be tried. You can't work piece, by piece, that would illogical? NO! it's not illogical to suggest that from certain premises a conclusion is true, nor it is illogical that many small pieces of evidence suggest X. And, I have cited many many pieces of evidence that you choose to ignore at your high-level of abstraction. ""I won't go down to the specifics because I like making huge generalizations about everything"". 

&gt;You're going to use Somalia as an example of private property rights in action working for the betterment of society? 

My point that private property is taken care of better than common property as a rule still stands. Private property is important, and one of the foundations of capitalism. Eleanor ostrom, Nobel Prize winner, wrote about how the tragedy of commons does not have to occur, but that it often does. She explored how commons succeed. But, the rule is that commons fail more often than not, because like the japanese fishing example that you brought up, everyone takes, but no one gives back. When Somali fishermen defended their property, they managed to succeed in conservation. 

I would now like to restate all the points that you have ignored(Or, I demolished your arguments): made stuff up about me pointing to 500-600 page books. I never even once suggested anything of the sort. I make my own arguments. Republican!=Libertarian on social issues or policies(this is a simple fact, no matter what you do to try to distort it and can be viewed on a high-level of abstraction). You will not respond to exactly what legal rights given to people you do not believe corporations should have, and thereby what part of corporate personhood is so disagreeable. You did not know or understand the definition and constraints of capitalism. Capitalism is an important part of libertarian philosophy, which means that you are arguing against something you know nothing about. 

Theoretical and not practical is the only thing you have mentioned. I have observed exactly how the enforcement of property rights is important. I have observed how commons' generally fail. I have observed in many distinct parts, and it is called evidence. Because there is no minarchist state, I am not practical, is the argument you are making. It is the argument that has been repeated thoroughly throughout all your posts in this thread, and it is logically unacceptable, and it would be unacceptable to just about every scientist I know. You claim this subreddit is about scientific examination, HAH!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One of my buddies at work used to flirt with and tease this girl who worked with us. One time he was walking past her office and he threw a chocolate chip at her. It went right down the front of her shirt and lodged into her cleavage. She didn't even notice it, and he was too embarrassed to say anything because he thought he sort of crossed the line with that one. She probably found it semi-melted down there when she got home and took her clothes off, and was like ""wtf?"".

Another time there was this fat supervisor woman and we were outside moving some chairs around for an event. She was bending over doing something, and her shirt kind of hiked up and exposed a bit of her lower back and ass crack. I have no idea what compelled me to do this but I got one of my friend's attention and I picked up a pebble and threw it at her ass crack from about 6 feet away. It went right in! She didn't notice, or she acted like she didn't notice. I don't know why I did that. I probably could have gotten in big trouble if she made a big deal about it.

My last work-related one in a million was actually a close call. My friend/coworker threw a pen at me from his office across a corridor. It was a fairly hefty pen and it landed nearby. I picked it up and thew it back as hard as I possibly could, pitching it like a baseball. Just as it left my hand, the big, big, major boss was walking by the space between our two doors. The pen flew probably 3"" in front of his eyes. I don't know how he didn't see it, but I just thank my lucky stars it didn't hit him in the face. I probably would have gotten fired.

Created by the same team that did Shaun of the Dead, before they did Shaun of the Dead. Ran for 2 seasons. Absolutely brilliant writing and downright hilarious. Do yourself a favor and watch Spaced!
-----------------------------------------------
**Summary**

Spaced is a British television situation comedy written by and starring Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, directed by Edgar Wright, and broadcast on Channel 4. The show concerns Tim and Daisy, two young people pretending to be a couple in order to rent a North London flat. It is notable for its almost constant dropping of pop-culture references. Two series, each of seven episodes, have been broadcast (in Autumn 1999 and Spring 2001). The first series was a nominee for Best TV Sitcom in the 1999 British Comedy Awards.
----------------------------------------------
Brian: What are you playing?

Tim: Tomb Raider 3.

Brian: She's drowning.

Tim: Yeah.

Brian: Is that the point of the game?

Tim: Depends what mood you're in really.

Brian: What sort of mood are you in then?

Tim: Well, I got a letter from my ex-girlfriend this morning, 3 months too late, explaining why she dumped me. It was full of 'you'll always be special' and 'I'll always love you' platitudes designed to make me feel better whilst simultaneously appeasing her deep seated sense of guilt for dumping me, running off with a slimy little city boy called Duane and destroying my faith in everything which is good and pure.

Brian: So it didn't really work then.

Tim: No, it made me wanna drown things!

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I agree, with mixed feelings. I too believe that the confirmation process starts too early. In some places, it is done on children who are far too young to understand what they are taking part in. At the age of 16-17, I'm not sure I would agree that people are too young, or that they are being forced. I realize that not everyone has my family situation, but I made my choice known, and no one could make me do it if I didn't want to. IMHO, I think the problem is less the age of the participants and more the culture that simply assumes you are going to go along with the process. 

I believe the church should change their approach to confirmation. The confirmation process should begin with an exploration of each person's personal commitment to their faith. I think there's a real fear that if they don't get people confirmed as quickly as possible, without giving them the option to step away from the process, people will never get confirmed, never come back to the church. But this cheapens the choice and makes it a rubber stamp system. Nobody really cares about it. Make it matter, make people realize what they're committing to, and maybe people would actually give a damn about their church, and not end up like me, forsaking their connection to a church that no longer holds any satisfying answers.","1264992123"

(1) this doesn't match my experience, as holding shopping bag handles at say a 80° angle to vertical does not make them seem 5 times heavier (2) the horizontal force components in the ropes cancel out at the point at which they are tied together and (3) conservation of energy demands that the work done by your hands as you are raising the shopping bags from the ground equals the potential energy gained by the bags, which, since your hands and the bags are moving the same distance, requires that the forces be equal also.

Your argument and equation illustrates the case where there are pulleys directly in front of (but not attached to or touching) each bag / sled, keeping the ropes parallel to the direction of motion on the bag-side, and transferring the force at an angle to your hands.  In this case, the distance (and therefore force) traveled by your hands vs. the bags is indeed different.","1264992137"

This is a criminal investigation. I wouldn't be surprised if they intentionally do not mention the poison to aid in the investigation. 

If someone doesn't know the methods used to kill him exactly, they can't pose successfully as someone that has information.


The current theory is his room was stormed by a group of up to seven men, a rag held to his mouth that may have been the delivery mechanism of the poison, and possibly electrocuted as well.","1264992177"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;After the raptors returned to Utah and ripped apart the Mormons, I'm sure that the military would try to handle the issue.

Mormons have a lot of guns and food storage, and a killer winter to mess up reptiles. Utah's one of the best prepared states for the Dino-apocalypse, or any pretty other apocalypse.

&gt; But what about the repercussions in society? People would be terrified, and the government would probably exert more control than was truly necessary. 

Let's just stay stock in R.E.I. and other camping stores would take a bit of a hit. Velociraptors in downtown New York or L.A. wouldn't last 30 mins.

After a very short time the dinosaurs become an invasive species. The areas of greatest concern would be temperate rural agricultural areas. Small to medium sized dinos would become part of the landscape and people would need to take necessary safety precautions, but it wouldn't affect your daily life very much unless you were a farmer/rancher.","1264992186"

The Christians I know (myself included) don't choose poverty. We choose to live our lives following Christ. That means a vigorous and healthy pursuit of all aspects of life, including the work arena. We believe we are endowed by God with our own unique set of gifts and talents that equip us for specific roles. For some, those roles command a high economic salary...for others, not so much. So when we choose to live out these roles, as we follow Christ, we take what comes our way.

Or as the Apostle Paul put it in Philippians 4 ""...for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.

"science","t5_mouw","because either the world will fall down and all anyone will care about is the scraps of carrion they can wrestle from the other crazed beasts or the modernization of the world will rapidly increase in pace with the internet all all that business which will allow people to realize that much of the insanity of the old world was due to out dated dogma which regardless of religion, political opinion, etc is quiet simply wrong - not saying people will absolve their religion and partisan preference but universally all the modes of thought will HAVE to include the new truths, such as how no one seriously believes in magic yet less than a hundred years ago many people seriously believed in occult powers and mystic love potions.  This process will increase and expand, the idea that a nude body is offensive will sound as absurd as ankle clips do today (for those that don't know an ankle clip is what stops under trousers separate from the sock so in the unlikely event of the lower portion of the dress being raised the ankle won't be exposed, this is but one of many, many devices used to maintain 'modesty' in repressed era england) - from the full length garments of not so long ago to the hot pants and oh so sexy short black dresses i see every time i'm out with the party crowds -we've gone from being 2inches of exposed flesh to 2 inches of concealed flesh.  
  
Head over to r/gonewild or yuvutu or xtube or any of the other sites that let people show off their nude bodies, they all contain a constant flow of nudity and ask (mostly) nothing in return - the most telling thing in my mind is the absence of heads in many of the pics, people personally don't mind sharing their nudity with people and yet they know that *society* might see it in a different light... That slow switch from prude to nude will happen on a society wide basis, maybe first the popular consensus will accept that people who want to be nude or exhibit themselves are 'normal' then they'll accept slower still that just laying around in the sun nude doesn't have to be a sexual thing....  or maybe it'll be a sudden flash moment and everyone will come out the closet together, nude beach popularity will soar and in a few short seasons the frequency of nudity on the beach, heath or sunbathing haven will grow faster than pokemon or yoyo's.  What ever happens, it will happen - we used to be scared to admitting we were animals because that made the world so much more scary, now we're starting to understand and revel in the beauty of ourselves and each other - elitist culture is being replaces by popular culture where rather than someone who tries their hardest to appear above humanity is less interesting than a jade goody character who was every bit as human as the day she was born.  
    
We have in short a world where people have been repressed for a long time, we're waking up and shrugging off the old world - how silly does it seem in light of thermo nucler war, water on mars, climate change,. democracy and all the other wonders the modern world dreams of to say that bare flesh is anything but bare flesh?  
  
A world where diamonds and gold no longer make sense, where information is free to everyone - all the works of the greats can be accessed in an [instant](http://www.gutenberg.org/) and every day more amazingness is added to our [world](http://www.ted.com/), where we all pretty much agree all humans are equal and  opinions differ.... can you really imagine this world revolving fifty more times around the sun and still anyone remembering why we found skin so scary to look at? will those sining demons or morality enforcing traditions which we don't even remember enough about now to understand still bite at societies bare ankles when we live in a post-hydrocarbon world? a world where robotics and AI (evolutionary CAD is ALREADY designing vital bits for NASA) have radically changed our concepts of work? where internet, VR, social networking, etc have totally changed the structure of society?  
  
I'm not Nostradamus but you don't need to be a soothsayer to see what's already happening in this world, i can't see how the fear of nudity could possible last fifty years, i'll be shocked it it lasts twenty. ","1264992206"
"canada","t5_2qh68","I never said you weren't allowed to disagree, I just think the article has more to offer than your initial post suggested. This has been my claim all along. 

Touche with the quotes, I forgot how partisan some paragraphs were, but those wer not the ones with any of the value I was talking about and they are surely not the one that I've been advocating as a valuable contribution. Even so, I made a challenge and it was met. Touche (for real this time).

I do have one more jab though: 

&gt;fails to even acknowledge her own obvious bias for the CPC

""There is no debate underway in the House and we are left to wonder what it is our elected officials are doing all day. This is where I cannot help but let my biased opinions creep in."" 

The fact is that the article has a lot of good information about the legislative process and if you refuse to filter the partisan BS in pursuit of the good stuff, it is to your own disadvantage. My original intent was to advise redditors to seek this out (as opposed to following your implicit advice to ignore the article completely), but since no one reads this far down a comment board back-and-forth, I guess there is no point in pursuing it any further.  

I suggested you read the comments to get a better understanding of the author. Surely that's important. I still don't understand how you can spend so much time with me but not have the 2 minutes to read what I suggested. You've probably spent more time typing your repeated refusals than it would take to read it. Oh well. Your loss.   

I also don't think that the saying many people take most issue with the dead legislation is a straw man. I think it is somewhat reflective of many who oppose this prorogation. And even if it isn't, the fact that it is repeated so soften makes it relevant to address.    

Finally, though I would never call our media left-leaning, I do find it curious how many publications are coming out against this and keeping the story alive while a year ago they wholeheartedly endorsed the PM in what I would consider a much more egregious abuse of power. The Globe and Mail is a prime example. 

I guess we are done here. If you send me a post with nothing in it that warrants a reply, I will stay true to my word and let you have the last one. Ta-ta.","1264992210"

"Health","t5_2qh9z","I haven't stopped cold turkey but have only had about a half dozen since October (usually because I was thirsty and drinking a soda was convenient). I had been drinking 3-5 sodas a day up until that point.

I stopped not because of HFCS, I had drunk only diet sodas and don't feel especially paranoid about Nutrasweet, but to eliminate the constant exposure to phosphoric and carbonic acids which, according to my dental hygienist, was wrecking my tooth enamel. 

I've switched to principally coffee, which I was already drinking in obscene amounts and herbal tea in the evenings. I've found that the late afternoon acid reflux I frequently experienced which had blamed on the strong coffee I drink has fairly nearly disappeared. I haven't got a tooth enamel report yet and it make take a year or two for my teeth to fully remineralize from what I read online.

When I did have a soda yesterday at a birthday party for the first time in 2 months I found it rather unpleasant actually. Too carbonated, almost salty or chemically. (Though this may be due to it being a Diet Pepsi, which isn't a soda I've ever liked). The experience reminded me a lot of when I first started to drink sugared soda again after getting my braces off 20 years ago. I had switched to Diet Soda while I had braces to reduce the need for constant brushing. Drinking sugared sodas after 2 years of Diet soda seemed akin to drinking maple syrup. I didn't like the overt sweetness, stickiness or the mouth feel of the sugar at all any more. And now that I find diet soda just as offensive I suspect I am done with drinking soda for good.","1264992217"

That's the problem. When conservatives usurp something good and declare it belonging to a group of people (""Family Values"", ""work ethic"", ""fiscal reposnsibility""), they are saying this way that non conservative cannot possibly have a work ethic (which is bullshit), that a non conservative cannot be fiscally responsible (yeah look at Clinton's proficit, and a financial disaster of Bush), that a non conservative cannot possibly  have good morals (hence the outrage over a simple and non threathening message ""We are also good people"" coming from atheists). 

When they put themselves on a such pedestal it becomes impossible to laugh and ridicule human failure, because then conservatives have to recognize that everyone fails. And THAT goes against their worldview of bad and good (conservative) people.

Maybe Joe could afford it because he worked hard, and good for him! However, does Billy, his son, deserve 5 million dollars for... being alive? That seems rather unfair. I understand the British inheritance tax covers large swathes of the population, but those parts generally are better off than average and that's not going to change. They still get the majority of the money. The money taken doesn't dissapear; it goes to hospitals, roads, the poor and other good (or, in some cases, not so good) causes.

The boards I've read say that the paper filters also filter out the acids, so it's a different taste.

I've had people rave about this sauce (again, cooked for a minimum of 3 hours) when it has tuna in it.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I live in Japan and have had FTTH (Fiber (optic) To The Home) at my last two apartments (in the last 3 years). In both cases, they were ostensibly 100Mbit, but the last place ran at 80 and this place runs at 20. 

Before that, I had 50Mbit ADSL that ran at 12.

Before that, I had 24Mbit ADSL that ran at 1.

What I'm saying is that Japan, which has shite for consumer protection law, is not really a good measuring stick for network speeds, because those numbers are created by the marketing departments, which can say anything they damned well please.

Now, you might be thinking ""What's he complaining about? 80Mbit is crazy fast!""--but to echo another poster, that doesn't really mean much, because, actually, it feels no faster than the 4Mbit I had on cable in grad school in the US in 2003. One can't forget that one is also limited by the target server. Things like Windows or MacOS updates come down in the blink of an eye, but everything else is basically the same as what you probably experience with basic broadband anywhere else.

Furthermore, P2P traffic is all but blocked by the ISPs, and even BT is severely throttled. 

Whenever I see the online ""why is the US so far behind"" ranting, I feel I have to give some perspective. Unless you live out in the boonies in the US, where your connection is slow because there's no way to make money off of improving it for the 4 people on your street, your connection is just fine, because the US is a lot stricter about advertising than Japan or Korea. No one is getting 100Mbit anywhere, and even the crazy-high speeds we do get aren't really that useful.

&gt; You don't see any benefits to our recognizing that we are all human beings riding the same rock through space? 

I hail from *a people* that produced this (many centuries ago) as one of their *cultural expressions*:

بنی آدم اعضای یک پیکرند
که در آفرينش ز یک گوهرند
چو عضوى به درد آورد روزگار
دگر عضوها را نماند قرار
تو کز محنت دیگران بی غمی
نشاید که نامت نهند آدمی

Sons of Adam are members of one body
And their creation from one jewel
And when one member is pained
There is no peace for the others.
If you are not empathic to the pain of others
it is not permissible to call you Adamic (Human).


As a matter of fact I recognize that we are all human beings and each of the groups in *the human family* have the right to self determination and their own culture, and societal order.  I love Chinese culture and would like to see what the Chinese come with in the next 1000 years; same with the Persian; same with the Europeans. 

&gt; You find the petty squabbling between states amusing perhaps?

I find nothing ""amusing"" in war, and find even less to amuse myself when considering the *fact* that I live on a ""rock"" wherein the likely institutions and ""leaders"" of the ""inevitable"" one world (police) state are [lying murderous prostitutes](http://writtenbyhim.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/tony_blair_is_a_wanker.jpg) who show no restraint in their ceaseless acts of (""amusing"") aggression against fellow ""rock"" dwellers who do not wish to sign up for the distopian inevitable global state.

&gt; Or maybe you just like the fact that we (assuming you are from what is referred to as the western world) are on top?

No.  The up and down of civilizations is healthy overall.  Up today, down tomorrow.  (Repeat).  Results?  Glorious expression and flowering of *diverse* Human culture.  Its worked for the past few thousands years.  (As opposed to the ""inevitable"" distopia which even looks shaky on paper ...)

&gt; You don't feel the least bit frustrated with the fact that the lions share of the worlds resources are used to build weapons of destruction to use on our fellow human beings?

Wars fueled by the insistence of ideologues (such as yourself) brandishing ""transnational"" and ""universal"" ideologies that they insist the other group must adopt (or get nuked ...)

&gt; I can't even fathom how you could not see any benefits but I'd better stop now before I end up with a text wall so massive you won't bother to read it anyway.

I see a future humanity that has reached a level of maturity and development in terms of mind, psyche, and spirit, which very same qualities would insure the success and justice of their attempt to practice unity in diversity.  Neither humanity, nor the current global institutions, and certainly not the existing power elite and their hired and blackmailed stage-puppet whores (aka ""statesmen"") are in any way qualified or desirable as the actors to initiate (much less, God help us, implement) a one world government.

Your best bet would be to offer to go down on her first, and don't just do this because you want reciprocation, it's quite fun. Still it does give you an opportunity to ask for one.

Don't pressure her into giving you a blowjob though since ultimately, it's up to her.

Also, even if your girlfriend was sexually abused when she was young, the fact that you two have been together so many years and have sex means that she trusts you and probably wouldn't have a problem asking.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The year is 1997, I am working the night shift at the Ellis 1 prison unit in huntsville texas as a prison guard. It's july and even though the sun is down (I worked 10p to 6a) it is hot as hell. I was working in a perimeter picket (guard tower) this particular night and had just gotten settled into my duty post expecting another boring night, just trying to stay awake. My phone rings so I answer, and it is the radio picket (the tower at the front gate of the unit) wanting to know if I needed ice delivered to my picket for the cooler. So I stand up and walk outside to check the cooler and I see a person climb over the top of the fence. I tell the radio picket I had one running, grabbed my shot gun, racked a round into the chamber and yelled ""Get on the fucking ground!"".  Next thing I know there are officers everywhere picking this inmate up off the ground and another one too that had not made the attempt to climb yet. Turns out both of them were death row inmates. 

Thanksgiving night 1998 I was in the next picket down and seven death row inmates tried to escape. I shot the only one who made it over both fences. It was not a immediately fatal wound. He made it 7 miles to harmon creek and bled out in the water and drowned. His body was recovered a week later. The other six never made it over the first fence.  

The first escape attempt I was working [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=ellis+unit&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=34.671324,79.013672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=ellis+unit&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=30.88325,-95.4566&amp;spn=0.004585,0.009645&amp;t=h&amp;z=17) where the map is centered.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","There's compassion mixed with wisdom, and there's ""idiot"" compassion.  Compassion is caring for the well being of others, and not wanting them to hurt.  ""Idiot"" compassion usually involves letting other people do harm because you don't know how to or are too afraid to handle the situation.

You have to let your child know why the bully is hurting them, which is most likely because inside the bully is suffering and taking it out on other people.

You also have to let your child know that letting the bully hurt them is only going to cause more suffering for the bully and also to themselves, so they should try and prevent it and stop the bully as best they can -- be it getting a teacher involved, or standing up for themselves and telling the bully off.

A lot of people think that just sitting there and taking it when people are being nasty to you is compassion, because doing otherwise might upset them, but it's not.  If anything it's selfishness, cowardice or laziness.  It doesn't help either yourself or the person doing the harm.  Sometimes upsetting someone is much more compassionate and beneficial than anything else.

I think what's important here is to teach your child not only compassion for the bully (and themselves), but to have the courage to stand up for themselves and not be bullied.","1264992635"

This is also why power lines sag. Consider a completely horizontal power line. There would be no way for tension to act so as to oppose the force of gravity. This is why the power line must sag slightly so that the upward sloping parts at either end can exert tension to hold up the power line.","1264992649"

What does have bearing on what I eat is the way in which the meat is caught, killed and processed.

So we chat for a while, me just intensely curious, until about an hour later she drunkenly launches herself into my lap. End up back in my bed where during makeouts she passes out. Wanting none of this I go to sleep on the couch immediately. An hour later I wake up to her straddling me and ripping my clothes off.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'll be honest -- your comment has made me a little uncomfortable and has got me thinking.  On one hand, I can understand that reddit is not meant to be a completely anonymous community, and I can sympathize with the idea that we should be held accountable for the things we say.

On the other hand, it makes me uncomfortable to think that right now you and other redditors are digging through my old comments.  Hell, only yesterday I got into a playful (at least for me) name-calling match with a troll that ended in me making a disparaging remark about his mother.  You won't have to try hard to find that.  And while I don't think you're going to find anything as racist as whatever66's comment below, you will no doubt find stupid things I've said when pissed off, not to mention things that disagree with your views (though I try to refute arguments, not disagree with views, but it seems much of reddit can't tell the difference).

Dig a little further and you'll find I've spent the last couple years fighting a form of late-stage cancer that basically nobody survives, undergoing round after round of uncomfortable surgeries and chemotherapy to buy me a year or two, all while doing my best to keep my head up as my life resembles less and less the life of a 30-year-old.  So should this somehow add any value to the comment I'm making now?  Fuck no.  Should the fact I'm playing the cancer card right now have any bearing on this comment?  No it shouldn't, and the only reason I'm doing it is to illustrate my point.  I don't see why my comment should be upvoted because I'm some stupid schmuck dying of cancer and not an Adolf Hitler wannabe.

Is reddit about judging comments or judging the people we *think* are making them?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I always got a kick out of scaring my girlfriend.  It started by just surprising her as she came around the corner then evolved to hiding in the bathtub behind the curtain.  Until one day I came up with the best idea.  I called her after work and told her I had an errand to run so she would be home before me.  I really didn't have anything to do after work and rushed to get home before her.  Ten minutes before she usually arrived home I turned off all the lights and hid my wallet, keys, and put my phone on silent.  I watched out the window for her to pull in the driveway.  As soon as she did I quick hid myself under the bed and waited anxiously for her to come inside.  She eventually walked in the door set down her keys and went through her normal routine after work.  I could hear her messing around in the kitchen, put dishes away and then nothing.  I figured she was reading mail.  So I waited as patiently as I could.  After twenty minutes of hiding under the bed I thought I was taking this way to far.  She finally flipped the light on in the bed room and walked towards the bed.  I could see her feet coming towards me.  As soon as I could, I reached out and grabbed one of her ankles and started screaming.  She was so freaked out that I had to reveal it was me before she went to get a knife or something.  It took her a while to get the terrified look off her face.  I think she was deciding weather or not to laugh or just run to grab that knife anyways.  But in the end I promised to never scare her again.","1264992686"

By definition, the most recent common ancestor between a bird and a dinosaur would have existed 65 million years ago.  Comparitively, mammals didn't really take off until after the dinosaurs perished, it's no stretch of the mind to assume that the most recent common anscestor between a pig and a human is going to be quite a deal closer in time.

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","&gt;Democratic Socialist states seem to be doing just fine in Europe.

There is only one socialist state in Europe (and even it is not really socialist - it just mentions socialism a couple times in it's constitution), and it's economy is the worst performer on the continent.  The large welfare programs of the Nordic countries (and elsewhere in Europe) are buckling under the weight of an influx of immigrants who are abusing the system (which parallels welfare problems in the US).  

&gt;The death of millions? The utter destruction of native cultures? Yeah, you haven't pointed out anything that is unique to socialism.

The GULAG.  The Cultural Revolution.  The Khmer Rouge.  Laos.  Cambodia.  Burma.  Venezuela.  Cuba.  North Korea.  All of eastern Europe.  The list goes on and on and on, and capitalism has nothing which even comes close to comparing to the widespread failure of socialism in the last century and the travesties which have accompanied it.  I insult you because though you seem to be an intelligent person, you have failed to see what is right under your nose.  Socialism is not the way to prosperity - it is the way to poverty and misery, and that more people are converting to the religion of state superiority is both distressing and disgusting.  

You want to know what is unique to socialism?  That the people who believe in it are so ignorant of human nature that they actually think it to be a viable economic system - and what's more, that they think it's actually superior to what we have now!  Go ask someone who actually lived in a true socialist regime what they think of it, and which system they believe to be superior.  

Actually, here are a couple more things that are unique to socialism: widespread and active systems for the dissemination of statist propaganda for the purpose of controlling public opinion, and utter intolerance of any form of dissent.  Socialism is, by it's nature, a statist, repressive ideal that is entirely incompatible with freedom and prosperity.  Please don't laugh - that's just the truth.  Show me a an example - JUST ONE - which proves otherwise.  ","1264992701"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My story is sort of along the same lines

This is back when I was religious.  My boyfriend was not, and we tolerated/respected each other's differences, but apparently I wasn't as good at the respect thing as he was.  My then-religion forbids any alcohol.  I knew he would occasionally drink when I wasn't around, but I didn't want to see it or hear about it, and I wished he wouldn't touch the stuff.  

But then one day he and his brother were going to go to the grocery store to buy alcohol while I was there.  I was mad about it, he knew it made me uncomfortable and I didn't understand why he couldn't just wait and do it a different time when I'm not there.  So we were sort of arguing about it as he waited for his brother to come upstairs to leave. 

He had a deck of cards in his hand that he was idly playing with as we talked.  He jokingly grabbed one of the cards out of the deck, and held it up so that I couldn't see what it was.  He said ""Ok I'll make you a deal.  You tell me which card I grabbed, and I won't go buy alcohol.""

I said ""Ten of Hearts""

He turns the card over, it's the Ten of Hearts.

Bastard still went and bought the beer!  Looking back, I have no idea why I really had a problem with it in the first place...after all I was having sex with him, and my religion didn't like that idea any better...all the same, after an awesome call like that, I'd earned it!","1264992809"

"science","t5_mouw","Americans spend money on many things, some of which are unarguably nonessential to their own or their fellow Americans lives. Yet some people seem to feel the best way to resolve the problems on earth is to eliminate spending for NASA programs. I think that is shorsighted and will not lead to the resolution of any of the problems for which they express concern.

I remember reading an interview with a poor farmer, I believe he was a farmer in Africa. He was asked ""Why aren't you saving so that you can plant future crops?"" His response was ""Because my children are starving today.""  

Though America's industrial base has suffered tremendously, already, I don't think that we're at the point where we can't afford to prepare for the future and need to focus solely on the present. If we fail to invest in space exploration and preparation for the future, we can expect the American economy to decline even further. Then, the problems you see now are likely to be far worse.  As Malcolm X said ""The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.""

If NASA's budget was eliminated entirely and the money was instead spent on social programs, it likely wouldn't make any great difference. The federal government alone spends nearly a hundred times more on social programs than it does on NASA. And state and local governments spend tens of billions more tax dollars on similar programs. So the impact on the poor from redirecting our space exploration budget would not be of tremendous benefit to the poor. By comparison, defence and homeland security spending is more than forty times NASA’s budget each year.

And, in the decades ahead, elimination of space exploration and the tremendous benefits that would have been brought to the economy from technological innovations spurred by the space program, would, I believe, lead to a poorer standard of living for the majority of Americans as other nations, with leaders whose vision extends beyond just a few years ahead to the next election cycle, would reap the economic benefits that might have been ours.

You say ""But drop altogether manned spaceflight and deep space masturbation until we can get our shit together down here (if that ever happens)."" Do you really think that's going to happen in your lifetime or the lifetime of any children you might have? I suspect that you realize that there's never going to be a utopian society here on earth in the forseeable future. 

I'm afraid that not preparing for the future will only exacerbate many of the problems already plaguing our society.

When there's an overt war then the church generally makes a statement.  When people are being ""disappeared"" and tortured by a government that may (or may not) be in power legitimately, but that supports the church, then there may be a gross amount of selective belief going on within the church politically.  It's impossible to ignore the fact that the US invades Iraq; it is, on the other hand, quite possible to *pretend* that people are not becoming the ""disappeared"" in a country that is not at war, especially in the days before the Internet and cable news.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","After not being able to figure out what this site was, my curiosity got the better of me. I signed up using a toss away email acount, and was on my way to ""shopping"" for a guy. After registration (it's free!) I was sent a confirmation email with this text:

&gt; Welcome to AdoptAGuy.com, the most tempting of supermarkets!

Hurry! Grab your cart and start shopping! Our shelves are stocked with all kinds of men, sorted by category. Intellectual, athletic, artistic, tattooed... Come right in and adopt your very own prince charming.

Uh... weird, much? Following the prompts, I made my way into setting up my profile (since when do products need to know what their purchaser is like? That onion I bought this afternoon didn't seem to care that I was a brunette and not a blonde like him), which included asking me for my ""shopping list"". Suggestions included:

* an artsy young poet

* a not-too-charming prince

* a strong and (almost) silent type

* a lover for when my love is away...

Seriously?? This is what I should be shopping for?? Following my profile, I was invited to get some friends on the site, when I noticed a flashing icon at the top of my screen alerting me to a new message. A bar beside the icon, set up to look like a status bar, informed me that my ""popularity"" was at 50 points. 

My message (from Sophie, Customer Relations Manager) was as follows:

&gt; Dear Customer,

The AdoptAGuy.com team is delighted to welcome you to the store. You will find an abundant selection of choice men throughout. All different styles and brands are available in the catalogue (muscular, clean-shaven, intellectual, pierced, tattooed, etc.).

Treat yourself, give in to temptation!

Fill your cart, enjoy shopping without being bothered. Prince for one night or man of your dreams, you will find your heart's desire.

Crave, taste, savor, starting now and with no limit.

Sophie 

Finding the ""search"" button, I decided to do a little shopping for my ""prince for one night"" who could, I suppose, turn out to be ""the man of my dreams"". I should note here, that the search is insane. There are 4 sections: the first is your basic, age and location. The second is ""physical type"", where you describe height, hair, eyes, ethnicity, all that jazz. The third? *Style*. As in, ""Fashion Style"" (fashionable, man in uniform, sporty, metrosexual); ""Social Style"" (intellectual, bohemian, executive); ""He Lives..."" (in regards to roommates); ""Special Features"" (freckles, tats, piercings...); and ""Specialties"" (photographer, plumber, DIY'er, dance, cooking). The last section is devoted to his addictions towards drink, smoking, and foods.

Ladies... really? Are there actually a group of people out there who think that this is how we want to find our *soul mates*? How many women actually think that they can doodle out the man of their dreams, and have him magically apear on their computer screens? **Seriously?**","1264992903"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; Three men on an island, all selfish prigs. They keep to themselves, deciding nonviolence is moral, and all starve to death because, yes, people can be fatally irrational sometimes, especially in extreme situations. Alternate scenario, one selfish asshole decides he values his life more than he values their freedom and enlists them in organized efforts to eke out a life until rescue comes. All three survive, adapt, produce, and cope. Hell, they may even make a coconut catapult, so I bet they innovate too.

Ah, but your comparison between voluntaryism and coercion is unfair. In the first example, none of the three had knowledge that a division of labor might be able to save their lives. In the second example--one of them did.

If, in the first example, one of them had such knowledge, it might change this example up a bit. At least, if we want to talk about *what's likely*. Surely, perhaps the one who figured out that a division of labor would save their lives was unable to convince his fellow companions and they all might die anyway. But then again, even with coercion, his ""subordinates"" might not decide to cooperate and they all die anyway.

Either way, you can't just change the conditions of each side of your example willy nilly. In this case, that condition was knowledge.","1264992935"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I'll happily grant you the equivocation of terms with ""reason"", not for any malicious intent, but simply because I'm not a phenomenal wordsmith. I admit, upon re-reading that I don't well define the difference between ""reason"" as ""general purpose"" (this is the one I intended to discuss) and ""reason"" as a synonym for ""why"". Truly sorry!  
  
When it comes to baseless assumptions, I would say that while it does seem to be the case at first glance, I *myself* tried my hardest not to make any assumptions. My opinion toward the subject stems from my studies of philosophers, many of whom could be argued against in their own right. However, maybe there is something specific I could try to address? And that way, if I can't address it, I'll have learned that I did, in fact, accidentally make an assumption.  
  
As for philosophical misunderstandings, I would argue that all philosophers have multiple intents and multiple views of the world. The one that I, myself, would criticize is how I treated Nietzsche's hypothetical attitude toward his own idea of true nihilism (as compared to what I learned as ""soft nihilism"", which is the attitude Nietzche opposed - that of thinking that if life is meaningless, we should stop caring about it). Nietzche was a proponent of embracing the meaninglessness and utter torment of life; but at least in my opinion, doing so is an indication of how humans cannot cope with facing this truth, and doing so on repeat for all eternity.  
  
To be fair, then, I would retract the part of my argument in which I incorporated Nietzche's belief. In this respect, I agree that this could be a misunderstanding and would be simply considered a fallacious appeal to authority.  
  
  
As for the rest of the response, I would love to continue to examine particulars, in favor of further critique.","1264993070"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At Siggraph 1994, in Orlando FL: Party held at MGM Themepark starting at 11P, three hits of acid.  My best friend and I sat down and ate a hot dog with Jim Blinn, listening to Dick Dale performing live on a little stage in the background.  

Just as the first peaks arrive, we ride the (then) brand new Tower of Terror ride--three times.  I do not clearly remember the next two hours.  At 4:15AM, we go to the final viewing of the 3D muppet movie.  Beaker spoke to me.  After the viewing we go out through a winter in New York scene, complete with chilled air and snow--there was a Japanese dude with two Geishas taking pictures of each other on a rocking horse.  As the party was over, the MGM staff very helpfully shuffled everyone left (all in a similar state to us) into a fleet of cabs.  

We made it to one of our friend's hotel way before they did, so we waited in the lobby--a lobby with a finely detailed terrazzo tiled floor, being waxed by a machine run by a guy named Sanchez.  The floor was too much for me to handle, so I went out side to sit on a bench, which was unfortunately positioned in front of a stucco wall that wouldn't stop flowing.  Friends finally show up, we go up to their suite (they worked for a CGI company not to be named) and consumed some additional substances to help level things out a bit.  

A couple of hours later, we make our way back to our hotel--the Dixie at Disney, and we all end up floating around the pool enjoying ourselves immensely at the experience (the water seemed like cool molten metal.)  A large family shows up to also enjoy the pool, it being a gorgeous 9:30AM morning at that point, but they take one look at the motley crew floating around, and decide, probably for the best, to move on to the pool at the New Orleans-styled hotel down the block.  

At some point, we get out of the pool, pack up our shit, and get in a cab to go to the airport.  We get on the plane.  The plane is stuck grounded on the tarmac for about three hours, until we finally took off--no, i have no idea why, and oddly--it didn't even bother me, even though I was stuck in a middle seat.  Got home to DC, passed out, woke up two days later.

This is the last time in my life that I ever took acid--not because it messed me up, but because it was just about the most enjoyable experience one should possibly ever expect to have on it--and one hell of a way to end a SIGGRAPH.

Did I mention we had a hot dog with Jim Blinn?  ","1264993084"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","&gt; In my limited experience, it's harder to get over someone you've idealised, because you blow what-could-have-been out of proportion.

I've discussed this with numerous people in another form.

The 'fantasy' that someone holds of what it would have been like if I hadn't left person x or if I had only had the courage to ask person y.  I've seen situations where they track person y for a decade and see their happy marriage and children thinking it would be so much better.

Even when you tell such people that *a relationship takes two, how can you compare me to a 10 year fantasy!* they won't let go of the fantasy.

Joseph Campbell: **Nietzsche says, ""Man is the sick animal."" Man is the animal that doesn't know what to do with itself. The mind has many possibilities, but we can live no more than one life. What are we going to do with ourselves?**

I think movies and TV also impact some % of people in idealized ways.  They start to think of celebrities or rock stars as their on-screen persona... perhaps with some hybrid fantasy of real and not real.

It's pretty staggering to live in a place with lots of live music (Austin, Texas) and see how casual music goers rate quality live acts.  They seem to compare them to studio radio stuff and expect the experience to directly be comparable.  Seems the same kind of fantasy of comparing real with remote fabricated (your spouse with a movie star).

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","You pose a good question, I'll try my best to answer it (though please realize you do heavily exaggerate problems that exist within our penile system).

Firstly, you must consider the very purpose of sending somebody to jail. Is it for retribution purposes (serving justice, giving someone their due, etc.), or is it for rehabilitative purposes? I asked the OP the question earlier, but I believe far and wide that unless the crime is based around some sort of underlying mental instability and/or incapability to cope with society, its primary role is that of retribution.

After all, a perfectly normal man may murder his wife who cheated on him in an episode of rage. He may well be a productive member of society, and would continue to be one, but that does not excuse a crime committed.

Just as that is the case, dealing drugs and helping with their traficking is not an innocent crime. It fuels the drug wars, keeps the admittedly unjust status quo, and ruins people's lives. In any case, there is always a way to make a point to society without engaging in illegal affairs that have such drastic consequences.

Now, you may disagree with me on this one, and that is perfectly fine. It is well known that there are very different opinions on this subject and I hardly expect everyone to agree with me. However, it does make me wonder what the OP's position is on the subject, which is why I asked him.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","The Buddha talked about the nature of mind, suffering, negative actions and positive actions. The points he touched on transcend any one time period and pertain more to the very nature of human beings, a nature that has remained relatively unchanged over the two and a half millenia since the Buddha passed into nirvana. 

Modern living teachers interpret and help implement the Buddha's teachings. In this respect they are more able to bring the teachings into the context of modern life and help others find their path to enlightenment. 

Finally for your last question. The Buddha taught the Dharma in India two thousand years ago. It was the path to Enlightenment, with detailed instructions on how to traverse that path and achieve the cessation of suffering. After he died three main bodies of Buddhist practice came into being. The Hinayana, to which the Theravadan belong, the Mahayana, to which Tibetan, Indian, Japanese Buddhists belong, and the Vajrayana, to which many Tibetans, Indians and Chinese belong to. All of these different paths have the ultimate goal of enlightenment at the end but they go about it differently and for different reasons. Over the past two thousand years monks, lamas, yogis, rinpoches, and Dalai Lamas have all been elaborating on and discovering new methods to bring beings to enlightenment. So when you asked if Buddhism has advanced, then yes it has. There are countless ways to achieve enlightenment each with their own guardian school or lineage. As long as these lineages are preserved and passed on they will remain available to all sentient beings. 

Hopefully I answered your questions. I encourage you to research on Wikipedia and sites affiliated with different Buddhist lineages. ","1264993336"

"science","t5_mouw","I think it has to do with what Jey_Lux said ""the awkwardness of pulling two sleds as well (both arms, probably behind you, one to each side"" 

--i think this would work even if you were pulling two OR one empty sled(s).

as you walk 'if you are pulling one sled' you would use your strongest muscles, and you would use the other side of your body as a counter balance.

-- the same reason we sway our arms when we walk, as a counter balance for the forward movement made by our legs.

Law of thermodynamics.
---For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

but with two sleds you have both arms pulling, ... you have no counter action.

the action of the other arm takes some of the work out of your legs

Obama shouldn't have sold himself as a solution to the problems of the Bush admin if he wasn't going to correct them. How would his campaign have looked if he had said he would torture people less often; that the corrupt firms on Wall Street would be allowed to profit with the help of taxpayer funding; that the health care crisis would be negotiated with individuals as a secondary concern; that infringements of our civil liberties would be [supported](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/23/democrats-spar-with-obama_n_296280.html); and that our state of war would [grow](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/12/AR2009101203142.html) with more deployed troops than before. That doesn't sound like the change people hoped for. Obama might have disclaimed everything he is doing with conditional statements and vague promises -- as I said before, that's irrelevant to my concern. We can blame the voter for being naive, or Obama for misrepresenting himself.

Obama wouldn't need to read minds if he would only remember his campaign slogans. He has acted on some of the promises of his campaign, but he has failed to honor its spirit. His legacy is threatening to be one of an opportunist who took advantage of the public's hopes to win an election.","1264993527"

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","*Needing* constant protection is a fact, not a sentiment. The President of the United States needs constant protection because it is undoubtable he would be quickly assassinated without. 

*Wanting* constant protection is a sentiment, an affect. In the United States low level elected officials have protection to swell already inflated egos. There is no need, they are perfectly safe without. 

The question is if Wilders dies if he does not have protection. If he does, then yes at least some subset of Islam is violent and prone to terrorism. If he does not, his thesis is wrong, as is the writer. For various ethical reasons there is no way of truly running this experiment, however, indulge my curiosity and answer this: what do you think happens to Wilders without any protection? (the only way we can do this thought experiment is to evaluate the past and see if any prominent critics of Islam have been murdered for political reasons.)

As for Islam being prone to terrorism and violence, you're selectively quoting me and that's not particularly a position I'm arguing, rather  that if he did in fact *need* (i.e. dies without) protection that would be a valid evidence in an argument that at least some adherents to Islam were violent and prone to terrorism. (For example, in the United States there are certain subsets of ultra right wingers and religious fundamentalists who are violent and prone to terrorism. There is ample evidence of past acts carried out by the groups. Members of these groups are aware of this reputation and do nothing to dissuade it. The nonviolent members either do not have enough influence or do not care enough to prevent acts. These groups represent a constant, if fairly low level, security threat to various elected officials and abortion doctors. I feel justified to say that these groups are violent and prone to terrorism. Not because all members are, but that enough of a minority is to represent a coherent and cohesive threat to security.)

As far as pure statistics go, it's hard to make a case on terrorism. One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Defining acts of terrorism is inherently a political game. I know of no way to empirically evaluate what makes an act terrorism vs just resistance vs military action, ect. ","1264993572"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My friends and I were in 8th grade at the time and we were chilling at one of our friends houses.  His younger sister runs inside and tells us that she saw two young Hispanic men trying to sneak into the basement window of an Asian ladies house behind theirs.  We phoned the police and told them of the situation, one of my friends chased them down the street and watched them run off into the woods.  He came back and we all waited for the police to arrive, which didn't take too long.  The police officer told us to stay inside and let them handle it.  However, being adventurous teenagers at that time we took the opportunity to take matters into our own hands.
I guess you can say we knew the woods and area better than anyone else at that time, so we followed the direction they were heading by bikes and split into two groups to cover more area.  The finally caught up to them and about 2-3 miles away and ditched our bikes and followed them by foot.  They eventually saw us, I mean, it's hard not to see a group of 6 teenage boys stalking you.  We followed them for about 20 minutes and asked an elderly couple to call 911 to inform the police of where the thieves were.  After that we stopped our chase and let the police handle it.  One of the officers told us that the thieves were caught just down the street of where we stopped chasing them and that they were carrying box cutters and some jewelry that they managed to steal.

tl;dr: As a youth, my friends and I chased two thieves away from a house and didn't listen to the police telling us to stay home.  Instead we followed the thieves and helped the police catch them.","1264993614"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The problem is getting out of your existing mortgage. A short sale ain't gonna happen unless you demonstrate an actual inability to pay. If you can pay, and there is no real distress, why would the bank agree to a short sale? 

In my opinion, it's unethical to try and skip out on a mortgage when you are able to pay it. You could do creative things, like sell it for less than it's worth, and then carry the balance on a new note that you pay going forward - but you are basically paying an unsecured note at that point on equity you don't own. 

Good luck. Don't forget walking away from your home will have an impact on your ability to get the best rate in your next piece of property. A lender will definitely take into account skipping out on a previous loan :)

Also, you seem to believe that ALL whites are privileged. If people would have reason (in your mind) to create a blacks only scholarship, then people could create a whites only scholarship for the same reasons.

*edit 2* also, let me add, when you said ""to help minorities"" you did not mean just minorities, you meant under privileged minorities.  Which cuts out the Jewish, Chinese/Japanese, South Americans (not Central), and Middle Eastern who tend to not have the proportional poverty that Mexican/Central Americans and Black people have. 

So lets assume you meant black people.  You don't just mean black people, because includes Aboriginal Australians, Middle Easterners, Southern Asians (primarily Indians), and African-Europeans.  So that leaves just Black Americans, but you must also cut out African immigrants who have a higher level of education and income than their slave descendant American brothers.

So you mean just Black Americans who are the descendants of slaves, does that include well off black Americans?  No, why would they get scholarships?  So that cuts out the suburbian and upper/middle class Black Americans.

So that leaves inner-city poverty stricken black people who are the decedents of American slaves who need scholarships to lift themselves out of poverty.  Which is a black scholarship.

Actually, I think that's exactly what people have complained about. Indeed, you've ""explained"" the same thing several times now - if people aren't listening, it's probably because what you're explaining isn't what they're complaining about. So please, stop it. We *know* reddit doesn't search comments (although it seems that the ""mess"" you fear so could be easily avoided with a ""search comments too"" box). If it doesn't come back with anything at all, we can start blaming overloaded servers. When it comes back with an empty or incomplete list of titles, that's something else, and you should probably stop apologising for it - unless you're in a position to find the bug and fix it, but aren't allowed.

Just sit her down, say that there's something that's on your mind that you've been thinking about, and then... you tell her. After you tell her, be very clear that you're very happy with the sex that you do have, it's just something that you think about and would like to try and work into your relationship. And be sensitive to the past history that she's alluded to. It's not an easy thing to talk about. The key here is to be very supportive of her and not be antagonistic in any way. You're concern is that she's going to misinterpret you, I think, and so you just have to make sure that doesn't happen.

You shouldn't ignore it, though. Talking about this will be a good step for you two and working through it should bring you even closer. And you avoid being a total dick just like you do in every other situation: by paying attention to her and not ignoring her feelings.","1264993808"

You're absolutely completely 100% correct. If people are well-educated and rational, every one of them, then a Libertarian, voluntarism society will work. So will, for example, socialism, anarcho-syndicalism, mixed economies like the US, etc. However they want to align themselves. Unfortunately, the *if* assumptions that I made up at the top is not a good one to make in the real world. There's also no way to guarantee that condition either, through education.

I expected that reply. Newton's laws of motion are exactly the same today as they were three hundred years ago. However, people choose to teach them using modern nomenclature and examples. So that argument is hardly enough to justify sijz's approach.

&gt; So when you asked if Buddhism has advanced, then yes it has.

They why advise going back to the original sources, less developed than the current teachings, and belonging to a foreign language and from a foreign culture lost in time, instead of pointing the OP at modern teachings?

&gt; You must realize this: that a prince, and especially a new prince, cannot observe all those things which give men a reputation for virtue, because in order to maintain his state he is often forced to act in defiance of good faith, of charity, of kindness, of religion. And so he should have a flexible disposition, varying as fortune and circumstances dictate. As I said above, he should not deviate from what is good, if that is possible, but he should know how to do evil, if that is necessary.

&gt; A prince, then, must be very careful not to say a word which does not seem inspired by the five qualities I mentioned earlier. To those seeing and hearing him, he should appear a man of compassion, a man of good faith, a man of integrity, a kind and a **religious** man. **And there is nothing so important as to seem to have this last quality.** Men in general judge by their eyes rather than by their hands; because everyone is in a position to watch, few are in a position to come in close touch with you. Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are. And those few dare not gainsay the many who are backed by the majesty of the state. In the actions of all men, and especially of princes, where there is no court of appeal, one judges by the result. [I.e., the end justifies the means. -bootscats]","1264993975"

So there were a lot of heretical sects in the Middle East and Egypt that found ways to deny one or the other.  Arianism was just one of them.  So when Islam came along they were very quick to embrace it.  There were political reasons, too, because they were also getting rid of a thousand years of Greco-Roman rule.","1264993989"

Agreed.

When she says things at times, and I ask 'why', she doesn't have a reason, which puzzles me, and then she accuses me of being 'interrogative'. I attempt to keep my manner of inquiry fairly neutral, and I suspect the label of 'interrogative' is a defensive measure when she feels uncomfortable when she can't answer the question.

It's freshest as a bean so when you do grind it, make sure you keep it in an air tight container. Actually, I would just keep it in an air tight container either way. Lastly, make sure it's been ground for a french press. Most Starbucks will grind your coffee for free, even if you didn't purchase it there.

&gt;
&gt;Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says the nation will deliver a harsh blow to the ""global arrogance"" on this year's anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
&gt;
&gt;""The Islamic Revolution opened a window to liberty for the human race, which was trapped in the dead ends of materialism,"" Ahmadinejad said during a cabinet meeting on Sunday.
&gt;
&gt;""If the Islamic Revolution had not occurred, liberalism and Marxism would have crushed all human dignity in their power-seeking and money-grubbing claws. Nothing would have remained of human and spiritual principles,"" he added.
&gt;
&gt;Ahmadinejad said that in the three decades of its history, the Islamic Revolution had inspired some great developments in the world.
&gt;
&gt;The Iranian president made the remarks as the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution approaches.
&gt;
&gt;Iranians are expected to pour into the streets on February 11 to celebrate the occasion in public rallies across the country, as they have done annually over the past three decades.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Well, my apologies for being glib.  Comments like your original have something of a pedigree among male responses to claims of privilege: ""but look how bad men have got it with respect to X!""  The example of circumcision is pretty disanalogous to FGM, since circumcision isn't enforced by women for the explicit purpose of controlling men's sexuality and autonomy.  I'm not claiming that circumcision is a good idea, or even a defensible one, but to compare it to FGM in its ethical dimension is to ignore practically all that we know about these practices.  

More generally speaking, I'm not able to summon much straight white male anger to defend the honor of my poorly designed genitals against the slights of journalists.  There are obviously no intrinsic criteria for judging the engineering merits of my junk, and I didn't design it anyway, so I don't take personal offense.  It was a throwaway joke.

Your reaction to it, though--and I wouldn't think much of it if not for the fact that it stands in keeping with a broad pattern of many men's reactions to things like this--is a little disconcerting.  It would seem as though even while cataloguing the ways in which women are expected to regard their genitals as shameful, disgusting objects of desire/fear/hatred which they should be embarrassed to be born with, the author must take pains not to cast a single (lighthearted, joking) rhetorical shadow on penises.  That's when she might ""lose me[n] completely"" and fail to ""raise inclusive awareness"", because men must be revived with smelling salts when the relative accomplishments of the human male and female reproductive systems are given mention, even in passing.  

It's also a bit disheartening to see how often many men care to venture their opinions on how we might  ""truly move gender issues forward"" unless they find themselves subjected to a taste of the social pressures and scrutinies, as which the author's joke barely registers at all, that women experience on the daily.

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","I think you've conveniently ignored the perils of capitalism. I think there is much to be said about how it negatively impacts many people, now, and throughout history. 

I'm not disavowing what has come along with it, but to simply disregard the complete destruction of the Native Americans, the abject poverty of the 3rd world, the Bhopal disaster, The Diamond Wars, Slave Trade, etc. is a convenient way to ignore the ill-effects. 

Both have done wrong. I have said I disagree with the prescribed remedies of Karl Marx. I do not disagree with finding a middle road that is better. What we have in the United States is not a functional capitalist system. It is a corporate socialist state that takes orders from the extremely wealthy. The biggest joke in the world is the belief that the American Way is the best way. It is nonsensical. Sure, this country, in theory, might be the wealthiest in the world, but that wealth is tied up in an extremely wealthy corporate oligarchy. I find that repugnant.

I think the functioning democratic socialist states in Europe, like Norway and Sweden, can show a different route. 

Dissemination of statist propaganda? That's unique to socialist states? Ironic. I find this country's right-of-any-center politics to smack of that same intolerance of dissent. You make widespread claims that government and country that takes proactive steps to ensure better healthy and safety inherently lacks the ability to have freedom or prosperity. I fail to see how?

Of course, I don't know if there are any players reading this who can attest to this but I've had my fair share of being dominated by spies over and over again (because I had my wallhack off, of course :D).

As for the machete kill, I already admitted that it was a rare kill. I go machete when I'm hunting blind and SMG when I'm spy-checking and when I am sure that there is a spy around.

In any case, I have presented my justification and you have presented your evidence. For now I think that's all I have to say and I think it's fair to leave it to the moderators and administrators to decide.","1264994141"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I focused an entire campaign around the PCs inheriting a huge estate, complete with servants, soldiers, and craftsmen.  Considering my low DMing experience at the time, it worked out surprisingly well.

Traits of the Nobles Campaign:
* All PCs were equal in their inheritance.  No one knew why they had inherited the barony, it was a mystery that they had to uncover.


* PCs did not have to manage their estate's day-to-day business, they had a highly competent butler who ran things.  He was very timid in his decisions, but he served as a functional regent while the PCs were out adventuring.


* NPC employees were compensated based on level.  Because they had a war to fight, fielding a large standing army was a major concern (and wealth sink)


* PCs were limited in the amount of wealth they could extract from their territory - the loyalty of the people dropped pretty rapidly if they took more than a certain amount.

I could probably do a much better job with a similar campaign now, but considering that it was one of the first homebrew campaigns I ever ran... I was enormously pleased.","1264994151"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","I need a new one too. My current MacBook doesn't charge the battery anymore. I was able to get my battery charged up in another MacBook a few weeks ago, which has kept the RAM active on standby when I move it (I plug it in when I use it though). Once it depletes, though, I'll have to shutdown/bootup every time I move it, and by that point it pretty much becomes a desktop unit. I've got 2/5 left - I just hope Apple announces new MBPs before I'm completely out.

I have looked at the current lineup, and it's disappointing how, 2.5 years after I purchased my MacBook, the base 13"" MBP has almost the same exact specs:

 * 2.16 (my MB) vs 2.26 (MBP) GHz Core 2 Duo
 * 2GB RAM (both)
 * 1280x800 screen (both)
 * 8x SuperDrive (both)

(There are other similarities, too, like the 802.11n and gigabit networks, but I can't fault the MBP for those as there's nothing better out)

Hopefully the updated models come with the Core i5 processor and 4GB RAM standard. I'd also really like to see an improved screen resolution. The SuperDrive I can live with, but Blu Ray would be nice to have too.","1264994157"

Take her to a nice place for a date. Order ahead and make sure the meals they serve are fresh and not over about 500 calories (red wine is a good bet, too). I suggest seafood or small steaks with veggies, no pasta places or TGI Fridays type joints. Next, present her with a gift membership for two a rock climbing gym or some other active, semi-extreme sports activity. Maybe a mountain biking league. Say you want the two of you to get in better shape and expand your horizons through active sports. Then present her with the equipment. Keep the recepits in case she goes bananas and hates everything. Then guage her reaction. If she likes it, go regularly and talk to her about the need for both of you to begin weight managment. If she hates, you tried and then you got to ask yourself if you're okay with her new body.

"programming","t5_2fwo","one place i ran across this idea in college was when a professor was explaining how to show that an algorithm approaches peak efficiency.

unfortunately i forget the algorithm (or even problem) in question, but the bottom line is that this professor (Dr. Dalin at UT Austin, if anyone's curious -- great professor) had developed an algorithm to solve a problem. he implemented it, and it was faster than existing approaches to solving the problem. he wanted to publish the algorithm, but he wanted to claim something stronger than just ""it's faster than what use now,"" so he started trying to prove properties about its efficiency.

he quickly discovered that proving properties about this particular algorithm's efficiency was hard, at least in a ""this is the optimal solution"" sense. so, after trying to prove it directly for a couple of days, he decided to take a different tact. he designed an apocryphal algorithm that could not be implemented, but that he could prove would perform better than any algorithm that actually *could* be implemented. (so, a super-optimal solution.) then he proved that his real algorithm ran approximately as efficiently as this fake algorithm. (he said ""99% as fast"" in lecture, but he may have been exaggerating for effect.) 

so, by proving that his algorithm ran 99% as efficiently as a super-optimal solution, he could make a really strong claim about the efficiency of his new algorithm in an absolute sense. he wasn't able to claim that his was the most efficient algorithm possible, but he was a able to claim that if it wasn't the most efficient algorithm possible, it was so close it isn't really worth talking about.

i thought this was a really interesting technique for problem solving, which is why i've remembered it ever since. i haven't applied it directly since college (that i can think of, anyway), but i think it shows some good lateral thinking. i think this is the same kind of problem solving you described above. if you can't prove properties from the bottom up, start where you want to end up and work backwards.","1264994212"

So people without tacit knowledge of things we regard as complex matters are seen as stupid, yet have similar capacities as we do. Therefore their growth has been retarded compared to peers in their age bracket. But if we don't calculate for age, then yes, **I am definitely smarter than your children**. 

I would also share the sentiment of the op, being intellectual superior to the majority of the people I meet, if I work at a daycare or a youth reprogramming center. I do not work well amongst children. I'd say I try to avoid their presence unless they are of kin. Just because you are a child that is cute and cuddly, it does not preclude you from being in a constant state of stupid.

Kid: I am a car.

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","Unfortunately, Kona is an expensive coffee.  It's a supply and demand thing so the price will always stay high whether it's profitable to grow or not.  Assuming you're really getting 100% Kona, $30 per pound is a decent price for the mainland.  100% Kona is difficult to find outside of Hawaii.  If you're paying $30 for a Kona Blend though, then you're actually just overpaying for a cheap non-Kona coffee.

I charge $25 per pound and that's the farm direct price.  Any cheaper and I would be giving the coffee away for less than it costs to grow.  There are plenty of people that don't like Kona coffee but there are also plenty of people that do.  So you'll have to make up your own mind whether or not it's worth the price.

On a side note, can you get me the name of your roaster?  I'm hoping I can get them to buy their green beans from me rather than whoever they're currently using.  They're probably happy with their current supplier but in this economy it's worth asking.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","&gt;Most people agree that there is about 22 to 25 megapixels of useful information in a frame of 35mm film, so I agree that digital has matched 35mm film when it comes to information density. But there isn't a single full frame 35mm digital camera that can beat the exposure latitude of film. Most DSLRs offer 8-9 stops, and the high end might reach 11 stops. Film, however, does 13-14 stops out of the box and can pull off 20 stops when processed correctly. I'm not going to bother arguing 35mm against medium format, but film still wins that game too.

First, your numbers are off. [Here](http://imgur.com/EN9bo) is a chart I compiled a while ago from DxOMark sensor tests. The numbers in the dynamic range column represent values from the logarithmic scale (Aka EV values or stops).

You choose to argue the single area where film is superior (dynamic range) but leave out noise and color, and misrepresent resolution.

The fact is, digital clearly wins in terms of noise and color. Overall, the quality is higher. [1 - 35mm](http://www.normankoren.com/Tutorials/MTF7A.html#Wilkins_tests) [2 - medium format](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/shootout.shtml). I also saw a 1ds II vs velvia test in PopPhoto several years ago that gave similar results. 

Whatever - the point is, digital is *clearly* superior in terms of image quality. Aka a far cry from your original statement:

&gt;Scanned negs still beat the shit out of digital

Don't get me wrong: I love film (I use my Yashicamat 124g to shoot 120 chrome as my point-and-shoot), but it is *far* from superior - visually and technically. The exception, of course, is 4x5.","1264994231"

The issue is this. Cats are _domesticated animals_. By all means have a cat as a pet and do the responsible things like having your pet desexed and vaccinated and keep it inside at night.

Stray cats, ie. those who have been neglected and/or abandoned by humans are a huge problem and should not be fed or housed (unless you are prepared to fully adopt and take responsibility for)...

Think about it.  When you and your buddies go in for a pizza, you all throw in say $5 each.  You don't do it by percentages.  You don't write down everyone's income and then adjust it by whom makes what.  Sure if someone is unemployed, someone else might throw in an additional fiver to cover them, but generally, the expense is split evenly and pizza enjoyed equally.  Why should bob be throwing in $50 for the pizza and beer and everyone else throw in $0.50?

THIS is the reason why, and you need to make it clearer in your drawing:

If the ropes are *tied together* at the handles (as they appear in your drawing), then there will be no apparent increase in force, as the pulling force is in the direction of motion.

If the ropes are *held separately* (as your calculations assume), then there *will* be an apparent increase in force, because the normal force exerted by each bag/sled on the other is transmitted through the ropes to your hands, which then must work *against* each other to keep the sleds in horizontal equilibrium.

If we don't help animal populations survive then we lose diversity which is essential to evolution and survival. You sound like you're against animal populations! Your puppy analogy is flawed considering most domestic animals generally don't reproduce. The puppies are often given a better life, and there is no consequential increase in suffering puppy populations.

I have not forgotten that we live in a world with 6.6+ billion people. You forget that I was merely demonstrating how it is not impossible to have a commercially viable farming system that does minimal or no harm, I wasn't proposing that it be utilised worldwide, it is merely an option; one of many. Furthermore, not every one of those 6.6+ billion people require eggs, milk, cheese, etc on a daily basis. Health reasons alone should be enough to convince people that eating these things isn't really benefiting them and it should be done at a minimum.

You seem very concerned with efficiency, perhaps you are a fellow engineer. You should investigate [permaculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture). Then you'll learn not to isolate individual systems and instead take into account how you can have whole systems that interact at various levels to create the most efficient system possible.

I agree that there isn't anything wrong with insisting on purity. However, I am talking more about pragmatism - something absolutely necessary in politics.

To villianize just Monsanto over all the problems that come Agribusiness is scapegoating. Dow Agrochemicals, BASF, Bayer, all of them engage in the same practices. 

To people like me, the real issue is that Monsanto creates most of it's legal problems by being so cutting edge. 

As for people like me, who sell the products. It's really a matter of preferences the farmer has and making sure we are doing our job controlling weed/insect problems and really chemical controls is just one thing we have in our arsenal to improve yields.","1264994381"

If you did it by keyword and titles, when you search haiti you will only get topics/links/threads where the link is about haiti.

If I wanted to find random comments about haiti, google would work great.  But if I want to find links/topics/threads(all the same thing on reddit) google would be a terrible way.  I would need to search titles for the word haiti and hopefully links without the word haiti in the topic have the keyword haiti attached to them for search purposes.

"business","t5_2qgzg","But...but...market theory says there are never arbitrages....

I feel the entire point of this is to some extent stop arbitrage attempts. The vast, vast majority of arbitrages are not accessible to the average person (or to the mutual funds/large investment funds they have their money in) due to the fact that they exist for fractions of a second and have profits of fractions of a cent per transaction, thus you have to flood the market to get some real profit out of it (which large firms have the ability to do). Some people defend this behavior as making sure the market works properly....and to some extent they're right. But basically it means that large firms no longer have to be good at analyzing stocks, they just need fast computers and quick trades. It'd be nice to see firms actually have to know what they're doing when it comes to stock picking/portfolio building to earn profits again.","1264994395"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Rerucho, I practice chi gong for one hour every day, to open up my energy channels, before I sit down to meditate for one hour. But I would like you to take a moment to ask yourself, why do you meditate for? I hope I can help you today by adding a small sharing, of my own  understanding. I find that many people here on r/buddhism don't seem to understand the purpose for meditation. In the east meditation is not called meditation, it is refer to as cultivation. To cultivate one's self is the purpose of sitting down and quieting the mental train. But what is cultivation? The purpose of cultivating is to remove all of one's attachments and attain the Right Fruit. We live in the human world, and in this world there is the issue of sinful karma, that is the wrongs that you have committed through out lifetimes. This sinful karma is of a material existence it is real, it is a substance. A person who is to complete his cultivation has to first remove all the sinful karma from one's field. This karma is what causes you to get sick, or to suffer hardships in your life. There is also the issue of attachments, to complete cultivation one has to eliminate all attachments and desires. One of the ways that this karma is eliminated is trough pain. The pain that you feel when you are sitting down is this karma that is being pushed outwards and is being eliminated, it is being cleared out from your body. Every cell in your body carries karma, every molecule. When you cultivate you are ridding yourself of karma and are becoming everyday more able to endure. If you as soon as the pain starts, immediately change your position, or put your legs down, or avoid it, then you are not eliminating this karma, and it will have to be eliminated at a different time. If you on the other hand endure the pain you will find that it passes. It does not come out all at once because we would not be able to endure such immense pain, it comes out in phases, try enduring it and it will pass, then more will come, and it too shall pass. What my teacher states is ""whenever you think that you cannot endure it, give it a try and you can endure it"" If you on the other hand believe that you are sick that there is something wrong with you or that you are hurting your self, than it is probably that your cultivation is bound to fail. That is the issue of elightenmet quality. Cultivation is a serious issue. It can offer salvation to a person. That is what meditation is about, that is what buddhism and daoism are about. They are cultivation ways, one must always seek to upgrade oneself, and eliminated the bad stuff, and you must be able to endure the toughest hardships of all. Thus your compassion shall emerge, and attachments removed. ""Whenever you think that you cannot endure it, give it a try and you can endure it."" -Li Hongzhi - [Zhuan Falun](http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/zflus.html)

its pretty hard to eradicate all life on a planet, even a major meteor impact left earth with huge amounts of life. We couldnt kill all life on earth even if we tried.

**Black Bear Attacks, Rapes Zookeeper**

Here's a little dog-bites-man tale I couldn't resist! Except replace ""dog"" with ""850-pound black bear""! And ""bites"" with ""anally violate""!

Yes, last Saturday a zookeeper at the Metropolitan Zoo had ""claws"" for alarm when he was attacked and raped by the same black bear he had raised from a cub! Geez, talk about gratitude!

""It was horrible, just horrible, "" sobbed an eyewitness. Guess she sure got an eyeful!

The bear, named ""Barry"", "" attacked zookeeper Ron Gilks as Gilks entered the cage to give him dinner. Barry lunged at his throat, goring him with his huge claws and razor-sharp teeth. Some of the claw marks were three-quarters of an inch deep. Ouch!

Then, astonished onlookers could ""bearly"" believe what happened next--Barry began to brutally rape zookeeper Gilks!

Frantic zookeepers rushed for rifles as others tried to divert the bear. But there was no stopping Barry! This bear kept ""bearing down, "" and Gilks just had to grin and ""bear"" it! Maybe Barry was mistaking him for his ""honey""!

Barry's 27-inch phallus, armed with guard hairs as sharp as red-hot needles, shot through Gilks' rectum, shattered his lower spine and skewered his colon, causing his entire lower torso to ""cave"" in! Yikes! Bet that wasn't the type of ""cave"" you had in mind when you took up zookeeping, Mr. Gilks!

And can you imagine Gilks' surprise when Barry's putrid ursine semen flooded his ruptured chest cavity? (By the way, Mr. Gilks, whatever cologne you've been wearing, where can the public get some?)

Finally, zookeeper Eric Pulliam shot Barry with a tranquilizer gun and pulled Gilks from the cage. The unconscious bear was later destroyed. Hey, this ""Yogi"" made a major ""Boo-Boo""!

""I have worked with dangerous animals before, "" zoo director Kate Donegal said. ""But never have I seen any animal sexually assault a human being."" ""Barry""? Try ""Scary""!

Meanwhile, Gilks was pronounced dead at an area hospital--but at least he died grinning and bearing it! No doubt, this episode gives new meaning to the term, ""Do not feed the bears!""

Honestly, I have a hard time believing that, but if it's true, then either a) you're irrational, or b) you value even negative experience more than you fear pain/death.

&gt; I'm not afraid of death. Just like I'm not afraid of the time before I was born.

I have been a tireless advocate for openness here, but there comes a point at which someone needs to be confronted for failing to live up to [the community's standards](http://www.americanpirateparty.net/wiki/index.php/Spirit_of_APP).

"Cyberpunk","t5_2qi50","A lot of the presence of Japan in early American cyberpunk literature was due to the belief in the early and mid 80s that Japan would become an economic powerhouse, and the center of the business world instead of the United States. This never happened, and you can see in Neal Stephenson's work (I'm thinking Snow Crash specifically) that the Japanocentric economic view held by Gibson had turned into little more than fetishism (Hiro Protagonist and his swords are a nod, but have little to do with Japan, which in turn has little to do with the story).

It was part of the zeitgeist of the time, and I'd venture that it had some interesting ripple effects within Japanese sci-fi culture, as the Japanese have already been co-opting our culture (along with the rest of the world, admittedly) for some time now. I'm saying this mostly to explain in my head why there's so much cyberpunk anime out there...

I actually wrote a final paper for a literature class my senior year in college investigating the literary link between Cyberpunk and hard-boiled detective fiction from the 1940s (Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, etc.) A lot of the most popular cyberpunk novels borrow significantly from this style...most stories that don't fit into this mold are much more classically speculative science fiction, such as *Mozart in Mirrorshades*, Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner's short story from the *Mirrorshades* collection. Either way, the literary backgrounds of most cyberpunk authors from the original era were very much American.

You compare the creation *story* to greek myths!  An unfair comparison.  The people who originally came up with the greek myths did not believe they were writing literal truth.  They knew they were just myths.  Moses, however, believed what he was writing was true and accurate.  To Moses, or whomever you believe wrote Genesis, Adam and Eve were real, flesh and blood humans, and the events of Genesis really took place.  The Greeks *invented* or *fabricated* their mythologies.

I have not tried UNR or Moblin because they are only designed for the Intel Atom processor, and mine is a Celeron.

It mystifies me how/why a store that consistently sells out of product X won't simply stock more of product X until it stops selling out of it.  Seeing empty shelves doesn't make me want to buy other stuff in a store; it simply makes me curse the waste of time and gas and want to shop elsewhere.

What it really reminds me of is the stories that used to float around the U.S. about stores in the U.S.S.R. seemingly stocked with empty shelves.  I don't just see it in Target; throughout the northeast U.S. I see it in grocery stores, Kmarts, Home Depots, Sears, on and on.  The big chains seem to be unable simply to keep products in stock.  This more than anything causes me to buy online.  So we may be seeing the death spiral of retailers just like we've seen with newspapers.  As soon as some entrepreneur figures out how to run a grocery store online, that'll be the end of brick &amp; mortar grocery stores too. ","1264994645"

I was making a distinction between those who are incapable of helping themselves vs. those who are not incapacitated with some sort of physical or mental disability. It is inarticulate to paint with such a broad brush, as to lump these two groups of people into one category called ""poor"". 

My opinion does not require a great deal of substantiation. The poster I was replying to seemed to be suggesting ""poor"" people are unable to change there life for the better. You are either poor or broke. I see a difference.

Do you hold the same kind of compassion for someone who is in between jobs as you do for someone who lost mental faculties in an unjust war? Let me be clear: Both parties deserve some degree of compassion; however, a different sort. 

&gt;So, in other words, you CANNOT have everyone on a job.

This is a moot point. I never suggested the converse, but rather pointed to the notion that the slack in our lives should be held taught by ourselves first and our government second. 

But thanks for replying. My political views are not absurdly rigid. I want to hear what people think, as I don't claim to have all the answers. It is so easy to click the little arrow that points down instead of explaining your position.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Woman POV-As a woman who has been through rape when I was younger, I know that certain sexual things were hard for me to do without just forcing myself to do it. My husband knew about them and didn't want me to do anything when I was on auto-pilot (which is generally what happens when people who have been abused and haven't really dealt with it). 

He made that really clear to me that he would rather go without whatever the thing was than have our sex life remind me at all of what I had been through. That took the pressure off of me and made me want to work on it with him. 

So I would say, talk to her about it. Ask her if its something she feels she can work on with you, or if its too soon. If its too soon, she may need to go get some counseling to deal with it as she may have other symptoms she doesn't even realize are there. She obviously trusts you or she wouldn't let you go down on her.

Ask her if part of the rape included bj's and if she's comfortable telling you about it. I had a thing that I didn't even realize was a problem. I couldn't handle it if my arms got pinned down or if he was breathing in my ear. Small things, but they took me back to the situation in my mind. I told him, sometimes I remind him if he forgets (which is rare but in moments of passion things happen) and he is always understanding.  This helps build trust. I've been able to get past a lot of things because of this. Hope this helps a little. ","1264994681"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I'll be brief as I'm about to head out for the evening.  First, your ""macroscale"" section paints with some rather broad strokes and uses language that is rather vague such as ""The world started in pure reason, perfect order. Then it exploded.""  The truth is, we have no idea what the conditions were prior to the 'big bang.'  

Then you say ""Then things formed, and when things are formed, things break. Randomly.
More things still form, but many more things break. Entropy.
Eventually, there may well be a time without order, without reason; a time in complete chaos.
That I can see what you wrote, and consciously, physically, and intentionally reply tells me that we are not there yet. There will be no reason for any atomic movement in complete chaos.""

You seem to want to borrow terms from physics, but you don't use their technical definitions.  Instead it comes off as some kind of psuedo-Eastern philosophical poetry.

Then you move to ""Microscale"" and appear to invoke the hypothetical 'state of nature' as an actual anthropological description and assert it as a fact of nature.  The section continues ""society and genetics may even out completely. Everyone will be, act, and think exactly the same.""  Frankly I have no idea what you are trying to say with this and the remaining passages, though I agree that you seem to have Nietzsche confused.  

If you would like to clarify your argument further, I will take a look again when I get time.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","OK, hang on, before we get into an argument about AGW, let's dispense with this:  we can agree that it's a ridiculous belief that CO2 doesn't cause the global warming, right?  This is the only point I was trying to make on this thread -- it's inexplicable to me that this belief is so popular on this subreddit, and I think OP has a point.

With that out of the way, I'll take the bait on your points on AGW, Gore, etc.  I think some of what you said makes sense, some of it is completely illogical.  For example, this statement:

&gt;What else must occur in order for it to be a problem? First, it must have demonstrated negative effects which everyone can agree upon.

Global warming either will or will not have catostrophic effects on the planet; whether we can all agree ahead of time on whether these are negatives are irrelevant.  Did I misunderstand you here?     

Another point you made that seems completely illogical:

&gt; it must be create imbalance in the climate system, which is something which has never been demonstrated experimentally.

Of course no one has been able to demonstrate AGW and the future impacts experiementally, that would be impossible without a spare planet earth lying around and a few hundred years to spare.  Climate scientists base their conclusions about the future on complex models, which may well be imperfect.  Still, scientists model lots of things accurately.  We're not in a tizzy about the Apophis asteroid because scientific models indicate it will miss us narrowly, even though the only actual evidence suggests that it's headed right at us.  

&gt;It is very possible that climate is far more stable than we give it credit for and that there are net negative sinks in the entire system which nullify the effect CO2 has on it.

This is entirely true.  But, as determined as you are to demonstrate that it's impossible to predict the future, you'll have to agree that it's also very possible that Gore's doomsday predictions are accurate.  Right?

This is the fundamental problem with AGW and climate change legislation:  We have to make decisions based on imperfect information, because no one is going to be able to say with 100% certainty what will happen to the planet if we continue to emit at our current levels.  Personally, I think AGW is a problem, and we do need a market based solution to reduce CO2 emissions; a revenue neutral cap and trade program would be a good start.  

Finally, I'm not going to defend Al Gore.  He's had a net negative impact on climate change by overly politicizing the issues.  I do find it ironic that you smear him while chiding me for smearing Anthony Watts.  And FWIW, while my attacks on Watts's work were ad hominem, my complaints about him weren't innacurate.  He is a former TV weatherman, and he has in the past received gobs of money from the Hertigage foundation, which receives a substantial chunk of it's funding from oil &amp; gas companies.   

Fair point, it doesn't demonstrate that his conclusions wrong.  But it's always strange that climate skeptics/deniers are so quick to point this out -- the basis of many climate denialists positions is ad hominem.  ""Climategate"" was one GIANT ad hominem attack.  ","1264994789"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I liked your article, but your words are falling on deaf ears here.  Most people here are going to regurgitate the same old mantra of pre-mature optimization in some form or another to appear intelligent whether you're arguing that or not.  

Most of the people here have built their entire lives on easy and maximal ""convenience"" coding, making the computer come to them instead of meeting it halfway, and are more than willing to gloss over the price it comes at, instead putting their hands over their ears and going ""lalalalalala; I can't hear you!"" to every new idea that doesn't sit well with their rigid dogma.  This type of behavior is what you see in a closed and ugly community.

To them, you are perceived as a threat to their ability to ignorantly continue doing what they're doing.  I have heard it recited over and over here, in truly goose-stepping fashion, that you shouldn't bother with hand-coded assembly because optimizing compilers solve everything and always do better than a programmer.  No amount of proof to the contrary will convince them because they have already let someone else make up their mind for them.

About the only thing they know is that they're intimidated by assembly language, so it makes it quite easy for them to lash out against things they don't understand.  The people here are mostly mediocre programmers, and they stay mediocre because they have a basket full of excuses every time they see something too challenging. 

The saddest thing is assembly language isn't as difficult as they seem to believe, but that doesn't matter.  It looks scary, therefore it must be fought at every opportunity.","1264994827"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; That would be because it's illegal. You think Heroin costs £40 ($70) a gram to produce?

Heroin also happens to be incredibly addictive, if that's believable to you. We're not talking about psychologically addicted, like somebody addicted to video games. We are talking about one of the most physically addictive drugs out there that puts the user through hell and back again if they even try to stop their habits.

While it's true that it's overly expensive, that doesn't mean people wouldn't go broke. Just like any drug, its potency wears off after consistent use, and users become gradually more and more demanding. Some people can afford it, but it's a slippery slope without an end in sight. You will continue to consume more until you do something stupid, overdose, or run out of funds.

&gt; one eventually overdosed.

No. Not knowing how potent the product is doesn't mean he overdosed. Often, people simply lose control.

Or, as you're probably aware, it may parallel the case of alcohol. While your tolerance may build up, the level at which your liver can no longer take it and you run the risk of dying doesn't change. You can die of alcohol poisoning without ever even feeling drunk, given the appropriate conditions.","1264994857"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","You misunderstand me.

Perhaps that is deliberate (but you say you're not being disingenuous), so perhaps it's because I'm not being clear.

I never said he wasn't important, I said he wasn't considered as ""important"".  I bet you $100 that if queried, the majority of (let's say) Professors of English would rate Faulkner, Hemingway and Fitzgerald, Joyce, Beckett and Shaw, Shakespeare, Woolf and Lawrence as more ""important"" to the Canon than Stephen King.  Now, we can debate for hours the meaning of ""important"" in this context, but there is certainly some grain in truth that much of what King writes is derivative; he's not exactly groundbreaking.

Is he a good author?  Absolutely.  Is he as ""important"" to the history of English Letters as the authors above?  As influential?  I certainly don't think so, and I warrant the vast majority of interested parties would agree.

The issue of awards is not indicative of everything, but it's certainly a good benchmark for what constitutes a well regarded oeuvre; especially if we are talking about things like the Nobel Prize.  But it's only a guideline, if you will.  A pointer.  One slight possible contributing datum in making up one's mind on the ""importance"" of the author's works.

I'm certainly not trying to convince you of anything.  I'm explaining my opinion, as you have yours.  Why do I think he doesn't fit in with some of the greats?  Because his work is exactly as he describes it; populist, easy to digest, derivative, formulaic and unoriginal (if you'll pardon the slight tautology).

Do I like his books?  Yeah, most of his early stuff that I read.  Personally I agree, now that it was pointed out explicitly, that his ""drug induced"" work was better than much of his new stuff, none of which I've been able to finish.

Do I think he's as good as (say) Marquez or Steinbeck?  Erm... no.  But I don't expect you to agree with me, as you have firmly set opinions.  Like most people!  That's a good thing, generally.

Finally, you seem like an educated person too.  Who isn't these days?  But beyond being mildly condescending, what has that got to do with anything?  I'm less educated that you may think.  Does that mean my opinion is of any less value than yours?","1264994907"

Consider the facts of the video, that cold hard evidence was spun around as counter-hypothesis by the skeptic's attack machine, other facts ignored, and gross willful misinterpretation was rampant. Consider the fact that the CRU was *hacked* illegally to obtain these emails. Is it any wonder they deleted their emails? Sure, they could have deleted them because there was suspicious information. But consider the possibility enunciated in the video, that they did nothing fraudulent but were implicated anyway. Isn't it sensible to delete the email and remove the ammunition from the other side in the first place?

I get back from the bar with this girl. She was cute but not totally my thing. We get into bed (at our friend's beach house mind you) and start going at it. I feel like she is a bit too aggressive with the kissing but overlook it because we're drunk. Eventually she takes off my shirt and finds that I have nipple piercings.Suddenly everything she starts to do is unexpected, but i go with it.
    She mounts my chest, talking the whole while about how awesome my piercings are. She begins to rub her clit all over my piercings. ""Ok"", I'm saying to myself.""THIS is different, lets see where this goes"".It was fine the first few minutes but as she gets into it and her thighs start squeezing my ribs I'm getting uncomfortable, yet smiling and laughing because I'm drunk as hell. Suddenly my chest is getting pounded by this fucking stranger's thighs and I'm kind of freaking out, thinking this will be my last moment on earth, as she goes completely insane rubbing her clit all over my chest and pierced nipples. I'm trying to talk to her and stop it but the words come out as erotic wheezing laughter.     
    Just when I feel I have completely lost control of the situation, I feel something else. A stream of warm liquid is pouring all over my chest and she is screaming like a porn star. Holy shit, I'm saying to myself.. what the fuck is happening, this is my friend's house ! Be quiet ! As soon as it is over I go take a shower and hide from my first experience with a female ejaculation. You cannot imagine the humility I felt!

(Writers comment: I am paraphrasing a favorite story from a favorite male sexpot who never gets into situations like this. Oh the glorious fucking irony ! )

"religion","t5_2qh39","There are different levels of intolerance. You seem to think there's a black-and-white line, above which it is no longer tolerant. There is mild intolerance, making mean jokes about someone behind their back, or displaying messages contrary to someone's opinion; at the other end of the spectrum, there is murder of someone you disagree with. I think the t-rex eating the Jesus fish is hilarious, but I might think twice about putting it on my car because obviously it's going to be offputting to someone out there. Obviously that's my choice, and if I decided to put it on my car, that would be my right. Perhaps you're right that it's not ""intolerance,"" but I don't think it's clear-cut. Intolerance of absurdity or of wrongness is not necessarily a bad thing in any case. But my main point, as Conrad pointed out, wasn't to call the decal intolerant, but to point out that in terms of the exchange, the rudeness/ridicule/negative attitude started with the decal, and the other person wasn't being ""intolerant"" of atheists, but rather reacted out of feeling offended. Again... I think you can call it intolerance to criticism, but I think that's stretching the definition of the word intolerance.","1264995154"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","The Epson R-D1 hasn't officially been released in the US. So that's why the price is high on that one - it's a seller's market.

As for Leica: they nearly put themselves out of business by being incredibly late to the digital revolution. And then the M8 was a turd that nobody liked. Because they completely fail to understand the market shift - with the new popularity of digital photography - they're also refusing to modernize their production techniques to increase their volume.

So with their ""stay the course"" attitude, gouging customers with the M9 is probably their only option at this point. And they can only do that because of their monopoly on rangefinders. If Canon or Nikon returned to the rangefinder camera market, Leica will go bankrupt if they don't do something radical.

Also, my pocket camera is a Nikon P6000. It's tiny, shoots raw - and I got it cheap. (Just beware that model has some features that contributed to that model being a commercial failure: GPS that never works; the network port on the bottom that can only upload to Nikon's Picturetown.)","1264995173"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I just highlighted the parts of the report which I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to talk about. Their forecasting technique is an obvious non-disclosable entity.

&gt;It mystifies me how/why a store that consistently sells out of product X won't simply stock more of product X until it stops selling out of it.

It's a logistics problem. Missing a sale costs Target some amount of profit. For Target, that profit is less than the profit on each item, because its demographic will just come back; for Walmart, it's closer to the item's profit. 

Stocking too many of a product also hurts Target. They have to buy larger shipments, hold them in their warehouses, use more personnel hours, and distribute them using more trucks. Those costs add up.

&gt;Seeing empty shelves doesn't make me want to buy other stuff in a store; it simply makes me curse the waste of time and gas and want to shop elsewhere.

Target's main logistical goal is to both increase in-stock levels and decrease warehouse inventory levels. The former appeals to more customers; the latter reduces their warehouse capacity needs. But the goals hurt are almost mutually exclusive - almost, because Target can do certain things to benefit both. If it wanted 100% in-stock, it's warehouses would have to be huge. If it wanted almost no warehouse space, it's in-stock levels would suck.

It's hard for Target to do because the problem is deeply quantitative and requires a certain creativity that Target does not excel at.","1264995202"

A few points..

I think I'm only slightly exaggerating the insanity of the US penal system.  And sorry about the spelling double entendre there.  Reading just a few accounts from prisoners gives an idea of just how corrosive it is, and how little good it does.  

We could go around and around on the topics in the rest of your excellent post, and I have typed and deleted several paragraphs here, but I find myself coming back to this one question for you...

How do you feel about this case?

For me this situation is like something out of les miserables.. No crimes are being prevented, and no other criminals are being deterred by this guy being free.  He seems to have gotten his act together and is, by his account, is behaving himself.  

I would, however, like to see a bunch of the decision-makers in the US terrorism-suspect torture crimes spend a few decades in prison, as this might actually have a deterrent effect against others of their class.

A year ago one of the reddit devs decided askreddit had strayed from its original intent and asked if he could start directly banning submissions he didn't like. Some of the more self important users got together and made up some rules, an army of moderators was added to the subreddit whose motto used to be Askreddit anything, some of the self important users became asshole moderators and banned things they didn't like or things that violated the rules they'd just made and I stopped coming here for about a month.

I think not being able to link to a picture of something you have a question about is stupid as hell. Sure, you can put a link in that little box but I use the reddit bar and links in that little box add a couple clicks for me sometimes. Most users are smart enough to tell when someone is linking externally just to try to get karma (which is largely useless anyway and I have no idea why people care so much about it).

I would focus on the environment you are in and how people are interacting with each other and you and make sure that you are relaxed and fitting in. Fitting in is so important that most managers will pick you over a technically superior candidate if they think you will fit in better. On the flip side to that is that you need to ask questions and try to figure out what your job will be like there, don't put your self out as simply desperate to get somebody to call you back, you should be looking for certain things as well. Try to find out what kind of work you will be doing, what projects you will be working on, what is the development process like, do you have QA, are there regular code reviews, is there an automated build process etc etc. All of those things will determine if you will be happy at this place in the end.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Intern experience is definitely not irrelevant - if you want to work as a software engineer after you graduate and have a chance, definitely do an internship.

If you're doing it for personal satisfaction or to become a better programmer then that's great and I commend your enthusiasm.

If there's a marketable language that you prefer such as Java or .NET, then start attending the local users groups if your schedule permits.  Since you've got a year left that gives you a lot of time to network with people who already have good jobs developing software.  Just show up, make an effort to get to know the people there, and keep in touch with them for the next year so they know who you are.  You'll literally meet dozens of people each meeting if you're in a decent sized city.  Use social networking strategically.  If you are working a lot with Java, then tweet about Java.  Follow the people you meet at the JUG/NUG meetings and @message them when you see interesting articles that are relevant to them.  When you graduate in a year you'll have contacts at all the major employers in your area.  If you have a pretty good working knowledge of the platform/language the group is meeting about, you'll have absolutely zero problem finding a job when you're ready to seriously start looking.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","This is true, but the key difference between the way conventional publishing and POD publishing works is outlay.  It's a big investment - and a risk - to print thousands of hard copies of work by an unknown author (or even a known author).  Therefore the vast majority of submissions will never make it.  Most of them are probably shit, but there must be some gems that slip through the net.  As well as potential gems *after* a decent editing.

With POD you have minimal outlay costs, except for marketing which can be done much leaner, meaner and more targeted if online plays a big part.  No mailing out hardback editions to dozens of reviewers, you can just pdf them/zap to their Kindles instead.  You can target niche audiences better.  You can use social networking. 

But the issue is that currently there's a lot of stigma with this type of approach, as seen in your expression:  ""then they become actual publishers"".  Surely they are already publishers?  The only difference is the process - and yes, POD/vanity/online publishers do need editors - and the prestige.

And yes, this new wave of publishers would need to be discriminating as they became mainstream.  But I think another opportunity missed is the amount of potentially talented editors out there who could work on a remote or freelance basis.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Alright every one of you typical reddit idiots STFU.  Mrpoopyface? This is exactly what you need to do.  I've done it several times and they dismissed the charges every time.

* Don't call a BoA branch.  Call their main 1800.  You look it up.
* Log in to your account while you speak to them.  Show them the date and time the system showed a positive balance.  The issue is that some charges go through at different times of the day, and on weekends you can't rely on the website for the true numbers, until Tuesday morning when all has gone through.
* Sign up for overdraft protection (for a fee of course) or tell them to deny a charge if there are no funds in your account.
* State that you would like the charges dismissed because their system is not reliable for true balance numbers.  
* They will initially say no.  Ask for a manager and explain the sequence of events - that is if you indeed had funds and there were no charges that threw you in the red.  Ask the manager to dismiss the fees.  I personally had a two hour conversation with them and they admitted that it's difficult to keep track of a balance since charges go through at unexpected times.
* 99% chance that they will dismiss the fees if you haven't asked within the last six months.
* Create some alerts in your account to text you when your balance is below a certain amount.
* Ask them to verify your email address.  By law they are now supposed to alert you that you have run into negative numbers, asking you to deposit enough funds within 3 days.  I've received a couple of those messages, I transferred money from another account, and they did not charge me a fee.

Total time on the phone for you? approx. 30 minutes.  Worth the effort.

France has odd pracices that make it hard to fire someone [citation needed], intended to help the little guy keep jobs. Instead, it increases the risk of hiring someone, giving advantage to connected folk and hurting minorities. This increases tension between French and the influx of Muslim immigrants.

"science","t5_mouw","Everyone's missing the key words: ""one after the other"".  OP, please confirm that you mean one sled is attached to the back of the other.

IF SO, the reason is simple: you are pulling up on the first sled.  This decreases the effective mass of the first sled, and thus its resistance due to friction.  The second sled stays put.

If you put both kids in one sled, assuming you pull at the same angle (very likely, unless you stoop), you'll be lifting *twice* the weight off the ground, reducing friction even more.

Because you're moving horizontally, and not vertically, the amount of actual work done to lift the kids in the air is much, much less than to pull them against friction.  (Unfortunately not zero due to human physiology.)

Your kids will also weigh less if:

* you make the rope shorter (so the angle gets closer to vertical)
* you hold your arm higher up (same effect)
* you affix a heli-rotor to each sled, lifting it imperceptibly off the ground","1264995407"

Second, if you feel people should be able to grow their own medicine, then it makes sense to take it a step further and allow it to be sold in a convenient form (not everyone is going to grow their own chamomile). I believe the FDA has done a good job on this, because supplements are not allowed to make unverifiable health claims (and many companies get shut down who do) and recently laws have made it so supplements must contain the potency they state they claim. If anything IMO the FDA is sometimes overzealous over supplements (ie ephedra ban, which to me seemed more because it could make meth than because it was abused by athletes, as it has the same side-effect profile as psuedoephedrine). You could argue that supplements are not medicines, and in some cases that is true, but there is a plethora of research on a lot of supplements and to ignore that is the same as covering your ears and shouting LALALALALA.

It clearly would've gone clear across the face of goal (at best, it would've clipped the post). Of course, Park happened to be right about where it would've landed, and probably would have been able to quite simply redirect it past Almunia.

The point is, though, the ball wasn't going to go in without a redirection from someone. It was not on target. As Almunia was the one who redirected it into the net, it's an own goal. It's pretty obvious from the replay.

That doesn't mean Nani doesn't deserve full credit for the setup, though. That was some really brilliant work from him to get it into that position, especially the way he shedded two defenders in the blink of an eye.","1264995499"

When your not working on client materials and don't foresee any new contracts in the works, keep up on your skills. I personally like to try new designs and templatize them while I have downtime.

Get yourself health insurance, and don't forget to continue your retirement investment plan.

Set up a proper work station. Just cause your now working from home doesn't mean you shouldn't be using an efficient work station.

Since there are 8 million other freelancers out there doing the same thing as you, word of mouth and networking will be huge. Even though you are the expert, the client is still king, and that should be remembered if you want referral work. Therefore, choose your battles when it comes to differences in the website direction.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","But this makes your coercive example irrelevant, because you've assumed that someone was rational.

And just to be clear, voluntaryists certainly do not use the word ""rational"" like you are doing here. We speak of rational in a [technical sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory). That one could be colloquially rational or irrational isn't valid support for or against any ""system.""

If people are *not* well-educated and rational, then coercion doesn't work either. Nobody is around to connect the dots with the division of labor, and thus, has no motivation to pursue the division of labor--whether it's through coercive or voluntary means. (The proper negation is that not *all* are well-educated and rational, which implies that some *might* be rational. But if this were the case, why should one assume that the rational could get the irrational to do their work efficiently even through coercion?)

The idea is that if he does it through coercive means, he is expending energy on his coercion (his threat of force) rather than expending energy on the process of using/saving capital goods to create consumer goods.

&gt; private education, alone, will end up being pretty similar, since every business individually has an advantage if a populous is irrational enough to buy luxury goods whose demand can be fabricated.

I'll see you that quote and raise you [this passage](http://www.threeworldwars.com/world-war-1/ww1.htm):

&gt;Winston Churchill is an interesting individual, as he later came to the conclusion that there was indeed a master conspiracy at work in the major events of the world, when he wrote the following in 1920: ""From the days of Spartacus—Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, to those of Trotsky (Russia)... this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization... has been steadily growing.""

&gt;The second key appointment made during the pre-war period was the appointment of Franklin Delano Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy by President Woodrow Wilson.

&gt;Roosevelt is also on record as concluding that there was a conspiracy, at least in the United States. He once wrote to Colonel Edward Mandell House: ""The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson, and I am not wholly excepting the administration of W.W. (Woodrow Wilson.) The country is going through a repetition of Jackson's fight with the Bank of the United States—only on a far bigger and broader basis.""

She was hot, but I didn't hook up with her for years and didn't really mind, because she always recommended me to her friends.  We got super-stoned one night and started messing around, and she ends up giving me one of the best bjs I've received even to this day.  She asks me to come on her face and I oblige.  Problem was, I mostly just came in her eye.  Her mom came in to check on us a few minutes later and we had to blame it on pinkeye.

Story 2 (also high school): I was hanging out at a party with a really hot girl I wanted to get with.  She gave me a few Xanax and I funneled a few beers.  We decided to go visit a friend's apartment to see if they were home (they were really more acquaintances; I had been to a few parties at their apartment and they were old enough to buy us beer).  One of my best buds drove us over there and then left to pick up Waffle House for some reason.  The acquaintances were gone, but we were fucked up and horny enough to somehow get in the back door, so we stripped naked and start going at it on one of the dude's beds.  I'm too preoccupied to notice that my best bud who went to get food is calling me over and over again.  Apparently, the dudes who owned the apartment were eating at Waffle House and had just left to come back home.  They busted in on us, got really pissed off, and went back outside so that we could get dressed.  I went outside to apologize for being so fucked up and breaking into their house, but the conversation quickly turned to a fist fight.  I held my own just fine, knocked down one of the dudes, and they left to go ""get friends.""  Me and the chick started walking down the street to find the best bud, but what we didn't realize was that my best bud had already gone back to that apartment to find *us.*  When he arrived, the dudes I had fought with were there with about 8 other friends, brandishing baseball bats.

First someone calls and is pissed off because their password isn't working (it's never that they forgot it, someone it's always that the system messed up). Then we get a nice earful after they realize that they can't use the same password again (yes, this same person that insisted they were typing their password correctly before, now actually *is* typing it correctly when they try to re-use as their new password. Oh the irony).

The only argument for this policy I can see is a case where someone gains access to an account and uses it in such a manner that the owner of the account doesn't notice someone else is using it. After (at most) 3 months, the intruder no longer has access. However, I fail to see how this case justifies forcing 80,000 people to change their password every 3 months.","1264995643"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; ROFL! Then how are they hurting you? I always loved this mentality when it comes to ones job.

Let me put it to you like this.  I am salaried.  So if I am up for entire weekend fixing some shit a script kiddie broke I am not seeing another dime.  My job is more categorized as irritation vs stress.

A worm breakout, assuming backups are good and good BCDR plans are in place, will cost the company money in downtime, but not steal essential company data...which was my point.

Some days my job is a waste, other days I actually accomplish something. At the end of the day, I am disposable.  I know that and the company knows that.  In fact, everyone that works for you is ultimately disposable.  You know that and they do as well.  You are deluded if you think otherwise.

You are lying to yourself if you really think most employees are not there for the paycheck.  Why else are they their for?  Now I am not sure what kind of business you run but unless you fall into the very small 15 to 20% ""creative class"" type of employees, the other 80% of America is there for the paycheck.

And since I am IT, which is becoming more offshore-able and its workers more disposable everyday, I am one of them (80% percenters) because as essential as my position is, it is not very creative.  Employers always expect loyalty from their employees but it never works the other way around.  I am loyal to what you are loyal to, the almighty dollar.  Unless you are running a start up with your buds and some interns, those people will only be as loyal to you as long as your checks do not bounce.

No one gives a fuck what the company does or what its leaders think unless it involves a person remaining employed and/or getting money.","1264995675"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Man, I gobbled up the Aubrey-Maturin books at the rate of about two per week, back in 2001. It really got me interested in history in a way that I never had been before. Wikipedia was just getting started, so I spent a lot of time with an old Brittannica, trying to make sense of things. Beyond the substantial number of reference books that have been written to indulge the O'Brian fans' thirst for naval arcana, I found myself inspired to read other works and biographies related in one way or another to themes in the Aubrey/Maturin series -- not necessarily the Napoleanic Wars, but seafaring life, natural sciences, politics and culture of the time. Here are some suggestions:

**Typee and Omoo**, by Herman Melville: Unlike the symbol-laden Moby Dick, pretty straightforward adventure stories based on his own experiences.

**Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds**, by Charles McKay: For insight into the capitalism of the day, and Capt. Aubrey's sad investment strategies, the failures of which kept him forever at sea. 

**Castaway in Paradise**, by James C. Simmons: about Alexander Selkirk and others who served as inspiration for Defoe's Robinson Crusoe.

**A Pirate of Exquisite Mind: William Dampier**, by Diana and Michael Preston: Dampier is the guy who marooned Selkirk for being an a-hole.

**The Voyage of the Beagle**, by Charles Darwin: Maturin was not only a surgeon, but a naturalist, and you can bet O'Brian went straight to Darwin for source material. Even better, read about Alfed Russell Wallace, who arrived at the same conclusions from his own field work in the Amazon, Malaysia and Indonesia.

**Longitude**, by Dava Sobel: about the scientific race to master a method of fixing longitude at sea. Aubrey is portrayed as a navigation geek -- just so O'Brian can tell us stuff about it.

**Omai: 1st Polynesian Ambassador to England**, by Thomas Blake Clark: tells of the impact of Polynesia on the British imagination.

**Two Years Before the Mast**, by Richard Henry Dana, Jr.: True first person account of a Harvard student who drops out to go to sea as an ordinary seaman, on a trip around Cape Horn to California, in 1834. True tales of adventure, hardship, and class struggle from the focs'l!

**Blue Lattitudes**, by Tony Horwitz: The author follows in the wake of Captain James Cook, to discover traces of the man and his legacy in the Pacific.

**The Fatal Shore**, by Robert Hughes: about the founding of British Australia.

**Seize the Fire: Heroism, Duty, and Nelson's Battle of Trafalgar**, by Adam Nicolson: Haven't read it, but it's highly recommended to me by a friend who read the whole series -- twice.

**The Port-Wine Sea**, by Susan Wenger: A parody of the O'Brian books. You might like it if you thought Bored of the Rings was as funny as I did (hey, I was 12). It might be funnier if you come from Maryland.

If you love the dry (and long-winded) 19th Century English language and wit of the Aubrey-Maturin series, go back and read some stuff you might not have liked in college:

* Dickens -- Pickwick Papers

* Austen -- Sense and Sensibility (the second Aubrey-Maturin book is almost entirely on land, and is more of a comedy of manners than an adventure story)

* Thackeray -- Vanity Fair: Subtly funny, and parts of it *are* relevant to the Napoleonic Wars.

OK, so almost nothing I offered was directly related to the naval history of the Napoleonic Wars. But what I like so much about the series, was that it drew on such a broad sweep of life and history. O'Brian admitted that the wars lasted longer in his books than they did in real life. It's clear he packed them with anything and everything he was interested in (I forgot to mention Irish history, the Chilean Revolution, Feminism...). It's the breadth and enthusiasm of those interests that makes all those 21 books worth reading.

*tl;dr -- Hey, if this was too long, forget it. You're not going to like O'Brian.*

The defense was rubbish today. If Arsenal has to rely on their defense to both score and defend, that's bad news. Improve the attack and let the defenders do what they're paid to do (which they haven't been that great at all season).

the next guy i find is great. but, being a new patient, he takes xrays and finds decay under several of the fillings i got from the last butcher. he thinks it's entirely possible i never needed them but now he has to drill them out and replace them.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","In response to your edit, I am *not* just burning these bibles.  I did burn one, but that was for (mostly) practical purposes.  I am looking for something more constructive to do with them that also fits in with my atheism.  Anyway, here's my response to your statements:

The Gideons give bibles to anyone who asks for them, regardless of their motives.  I certainly don't doubt that the Gideons would be very unhappy with my use of their product.  But they are, ostensibly, giving them to me by putting them in my hotel room.  If someone was handing out Nazi (or creationist, or Velikovskian, etc.) pamphlets and they sincerely believed what was in them, would you have a problem with people accepting them and then using them to create an exhibit mocking those beliefs?

I think everyone, superficially, has a problem with desecrating books.  But can you honestly say that *every* book ever written deserves preservation just because it was printed?  I'm currently reading *Exploring the Levels of Creation* by Sylvia Browne.  It's absolute rubbish.  Reading it sheds some light on pseudoscience and the human condition and little else.  I would rejoice if all record of it was wiped from the earth.  I wouldn't advocate that it be illegal to print and distribute, though.  However, I think I should be allowed to do what I want with my copy of it.

I'm not in total disagreement with what you're saying.  Book burning and desecration is a slippery slope.  I don't believe I'm doing this just for the purpose of desecration, though.  I would hope that what I choose to do with these bibles will show that the bible is no different from any book and that questioning it or discarding is not something we should fear.  And I'm certainly not advocating that it shouldn't be allowed to be printed or distributed.  I do appreciate your criticism, though, and I sincerely welcome your response.","1264995935"

The first thing you have to do is stay cold blooded, don't panic and try to use your finger to unlock the key if possible. Try to slip your finger behind the key and pull towards you.

Chances are that this doesn't work, so the next thing you have to do disengage the keyboard from the USB port: Pull the plug out. On a wired keyboard this is easy. Pull the USB cord out of your computer.

It should also work on a wireless keyboard, yet if it doesn't and you have batteries, you should pull them out.

At this point you should NOT start uselessly hammering the keyboard. This could brake them off and make them useless. Not to say that alt+f4 is out of every question at a high speed text input since you could lose control of the keyboard and it could kill you.

Also, against popular opinion, NEVER pull your computer's power plug or hit ctrl+alt+del. If you do this the chances are that text input stops working and your keys turns into useless stones. You'll need the keys and fancy macro buttons. Don't make things worse, ¿Ever tried typing a paper or playing wow when the keyboard is broken? The same applies. So, if you have your keyboard unplugged there is absolutely NO need to pull out the batteries.

So now that you are unplugged and the keyboard is powerless you should start pressing keys randomly, yet carefully as it starts to not do anything. Remember: you don't want to wear them off or overheat them.

Since the keyboard is off it is now possible that you'll need to make sure it is fully unplugged. If you see that your furious tugging on the USB cord (maybe because the ports are hard to get to), you should consider getting a flashlight and looking behind your computer until you find it and pull it out.

Learning how to do that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keyboardlol

Another option (only for store-bought keyboards) is, once you've slown down the typing, put the keyboard in its original factory box and packaging and take it to a USPS store. Tell them your keyboard is a piece of shit and almost killed you and you want to graciously return it.

The alt+f4 command, if it has to be used, should only be used at very low text input speeds and only to come to a total stop since it closes the program and cause you to lose all of your unsaved work and possibly crash your computer.

Putting the keyboard through a window is not an option. with a wireless keyboard, it will only break your window and in a wired, the cord will slap you in the face on its way out.

(See this mythbusters demonstration: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imakeyboard)

Now, finally and if everything else fails, and you HAVE to hit the power button on your computer choose the PSU switch over the Windows shutdown because it may lock up.

He was at our front door, and he wouldn't go away. We gave him some food, even tried to shoo him off, but he wouldn't budge. He stayed outside our house, in the cold, and meowed all night to come in. We already had a female cat who was a miserable bastard (as great as she was) called Tootsie, so we were reluctant.

 In the morning though, after nagging from me and my sister, my mum and dad let him in. And then we decided to keep him (who we originally thought was a 'her' til he rolled over and displayed a boner one day), and then he became our pet. And we called him Sylvester, 'cos he looked like the cat from Sylvester and Tweety Bird. A bit like one of the cats in the photos shown here.

We had him for 4 years before he died, in the vet after my mum had taken him there following some sort of heart attack he had suffered on her bed one morning. My mum loved that cat more than any creature she had had as a pet before, and it still makes her sad today that he's gone, but glad that he had come to our house, and wouldn't leave, on that cold night that he came to us.","1264996090"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","I'm going to [copy another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/any25/i_want_to_become_buddhist_how_can_i_know_what/c0ikjsx) I made awhile back, which gives a general overview of the different Buddhist traditions and wikipedia links, so you can have a general overview of what's out there and see what interests you the most:

&gt;Also, here's a general overview of the different Buddhist paths.  As I've found (keep in mind as I'm a Tibetan buddhist I do have a bit of bias, most likely consciously and subconsciously :P ) the simplest way to describe the different major schools of Buddhism comes down to:

&gt;1. [**Theravada**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada) tends to be focused on austerity and monasticism. Mainly shamata (calm abiding) and vipassana (insight) meditation.  With your mind correctly trained in concentration and calm abiding, you're able to directly realize the cause of your suffering (fixation on a self) and reach enlightenment, freedom from all suffering.  While Theravada Buddhism does contain many teachings on compassion, it tends to be focused more on individual liberation.  Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhists sometimes call this type of practice Hinayana (lesser vehicle) due to the differences in motivation, however this shouldn't be thought of as derogatory, as they still hold Theravada and other schools focused on individual liberation as authentic means to enlightenment and eventually perfect Buddhahood.

&gt;2. [**Mahayana**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana) (greater vehicle -- again sorry Theravadins) Japanese Zen and Chinese Ch'an Buddhism are examples of Mahayana Buddhism. Similar to Theravada Buddhism, it beings with the realization of your own suffering and how horrible it is.  Where individual liberation schools take this as the reason to practice as quickly as possible to end their suffering, Mahayana Buddhists also realize that other beings are suffering just as greatly, and instead of striving to achieve a stage of individual liberation within this life, vow to achieve perfect Buddhahood so they are able to aid all beings in being free from all suffering.  They do this with the knowledge that it may take them many thousands, millions, or even more lifetimes to gain the appropriate merit and ability to become a full Buddha, no different than Shakyamuni Buddha, and all the suffering that entails, but due to their compassion take this route to enlightenment instead.  Mahayana Buddhism typically involves practicing and perfecting the [six paramitas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pāramitā): generosity, virtue/morality, patience/endurance, diligence/energy, concentration, and wisdom.

&gt;3. [**Pure Land**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Land_Buddhism) while Pure Land Buddhism is a subset of Mahayana Buddhism, I feel it's worth it's own description due to differences in practice.  In general, Pure Land Buddhism involves supplicating [Amitabha Buddha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabha).  In previous lives on his way to Buddhahood, Amitabha Buddha vowed that he would create a *pure land*, and that any being wishing to be reborn there could do so, and then have the perfect environment to reach Buddhahood.  Pure Land practice mostly involves around supplicating Amitabha Buddha so that at the time of death you'll be reborn in his Pure Land (and for more advanced practitioners realizing that Amitabha's Pure Land is currently present).  For many people, this type of Buddhism has too many similarities to Christianity for them to appreciate it, however in my own experience doing Amitabha practice and retreats as part of my Tibetan practice, I personally have no doubts that this is a viable and effective path as well.

&gt;4. [**Vajrayana**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana) ([vajra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajra) vehicle) is technically Mahayana Buddhism as well, as the motivation is the same.  Tibetan Buddhism and Japanese Shingon Buddhism are both Vajrayana traditions. However, the difference here is that for a Vajrayana Buddhist, the many lifetimes required to reach full Buddhahood in the Mahayana path are far too many, especially considering how many beings are suffering right now.  Because of this, they use esoteric practices (which may seem strange or even counterintuitive to other Buddhists) that can also be personally dangerous or harmful if done incorrectly; however, if done correctly and diligently they can lead to perfect Buddhahood in a single lifetime.  Because of their complexity and potential danger, a teacher is absolutely required for Vajrayana practice and instruction.  It's important to note that initially in both Tibetan and Shingon Buddhism, as a beginner you'll be practicing more standard Mahayana Buddhism until ready and able to understand Vajrayana practice.

&gt;So there's a very brief overview of the types of Buddhism out there.  Again, even though I tried to describe the schools to the best of my ability as impartially as I could, I definitely have my own bias due to my own tradition, so if anyone else would like to correct me please do and take anything I've said with a grain of salt :)

I'd also recommend visiting the following forums if you'd like to have more in depth discussions.  A lot of the members are quite knowledgeable and if you end up ever wanting to find a teacher or community to practice with they could help.

&gt;I defer to the transexual's own judgement on that issue since they have much more insight into the issue than I do.

Speaking for myself, I went when I was ready. The last time I ever used a men's washroom was sometime in early 2009 when I was still in androgynous-mode and didn't have the confidence to risk going into the women's room.

Interestingly, all the men stared at me and gave me looks.

But the best answer is: when you're ready. Setting public standards for this sort of thing is a fool's errand. Instituting a hormone requirement can discriminate against those unable to afford them or those who are medically unable to take them. That besides, a much more practical question: who the hell enforces this?

Secondly Forever_Erratic is asking a lot of what-if questions that attempt to draw a solid line on the issue based on appearance. Well... what about [cis people who faced bathroom discrimination based on appearance?](http://www.transgenderlegal.org/headline_show.php?id=7) It's a very grey matter and the decision is best left to the individual. 

When it comes to ""cheaters"" I think this is largely a made up concern. If a man or a woman tried to gain access to the opposite sex washroom for any number of shenanigans the law is already equipped to deal with that.

And for any sort of perverted type, male or female, I have to tell you nothing especially sexy happens in either bathroom so... you're out of luck.

In the women's room there's nothing particularly exotic going on. [What we do is pretty bloody obvious.](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/10/12/) I think.

If someone wants to go into a restroom to stir up trouble, they're already quite empowered to do so and nothing at present is stopping them. If they're caught, they can also be prosecuted. Preventing discrimination against trans people has no bearing on the subject. At present a cis woman could hang out in a washroom smoking weed and groping passersby and this would be a prosecutable offence under at least two existing laws that are not affected by the coming ENDA legislation.

So, to the OP, your good intentions are noted but I feel this is a largely moot issue.","1264996125"

Crap foods, like soda, crisps, pastries, and candy have the highest markup of any prepared foods. Nearly all of the foods that we associate with a poor diet are actually processed  versions of the cheapest foods available. Not cheap because of subsidization, but cheap because they're easy to grow, provide high yields per acre, and are easy to ship and store. They're actually quite over priced  when you factor the cost of  the raw products they're made from.

I was fishing for coho (trolling) on the west coast of Vancouver Island (Port Renfrew) with my dad and older brother. We had hit a really good spot and had been catching fish all morning. We then hit a pretty big fish which we fought for 15 minutes before our line snapped about 8 meters above where our flasher was. We were more bummed about losing all that fishing gear, since I was using my favourite spoon on that rod.

Oh well, we reset our lines and kept going. About an hour later we saw something flashing on the surface a few hundred meters away. We slowly trolled towards it to see what it was and lo and behold it was our flasher just floating along with the fish a ways ahead just meters under the surface. We slowed down and found the line trailing off the flasher, where we picked it up and brought the fish in by hand. We ended up getting the spoon and flasher back, along with netting the second biggest coho that day at 16 pounds.

However the cue ball launches in a perfect arc straight for my face, I barely dodged it by tilting my head and it nails the back wall and everyone turns to figue out wtf the sounds was.  I just turned to the side, took a sip on my drink and said, ""Your shot"" dead pan.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Most password storage mechanisms include the salt with the hash.  The main purpose of the salt is to make things like [rainbow tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) not worthwhile.  As an example, consider the following line from a Unix shadow file:

Here, the string between the 2nd and 3rd $ (KHFOara/) is the salt, the number between the first pair of $ indicates the hash function being used, and everything between the third $ and the : is the password hash.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; Property rights only exist within a social contract that protects them. Outside of a social contract you only have a right to that which you can protect.

Property is merely something that I own, and ownership is the right to control something to the exclusion of others. That I might not be able to forcibly protect said property against an intruder does not invalidate the existence of my ownership.

Property and ownership are merely constructs that provide a framework to deal with conflict.

&gt; You cannot make a moral claim to property as you cannot historically validate such a claim. Therefore you have to rely upon social structures to both lay a claim and enforce them.

You *are* making a moral claim to property by saying that the community/society/State has ownership over a given geographic region. This is what gives them the authority to set rules. If this body doesn't have ownership, then they are violating your ownership of your property.

&gt; This is a property debate. Sneaking in individuals does not make your point any stronger,it just shows your debating in bad faith. I have stated repeatedly the individual is under no obligation to stay within the geographic area.

I didn't sneak it in. I meant it. If you don't have that claim to ownership over a geographic region, then you have no standing to place obligations on me.","1264996310"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; Government can, when applied poorly, exacerbate any problem.

The problem is that government can only be applied well when one is his own government. Once you figure the corrupting effect of power over others into the equation it all goes to hell. Decent people who genuinely desire to help other people are rarely inclined to go into government work.

&gt;  I would love to see libertarians stop arguing about the philosophical underpinnings of government, and start using the policy we have every right to create in the aid of the less fortunate...

The ends hardly justify the means, especially those means are the forcible extraction of money from those who have earned it and have not earned its removal. It's like asking Robin Hood to lay off stealing from Lord Bumbleberth because Lord Bumbleberth only whips his serfs every other Tuesday rather than every time they falter. We will continue to rail against the principle of government because the principle, rather than the practice, is the problem.

&gt;  I think the reflexive focus on never ever ever admitting a regulation or tax has a legitimate use helps no one, even libertarians themselves.

It's not about winning; it's about being right and just. When every regulation offered merely raises the barrier of entry into various industries and further solidifies the position of the multinational corporations we all hate with a fervor, how are we to respond?

As far as taxation goes, I iterated my point about means and ends already.

&gt; We just label you as unable to negotiate in good faith and largely an unreasonable lot

More's the pity, since all we want is the liberty to be left alone. This liberty exists not at all anymore anywhere on Earth.

By the way, it's nice to have a civil discussion with the opposition. [insert smiley here]","1264996333"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'm going to suggest you take a calm pill as well. It doesn't matter that E-Inks is ""optically identical."" There is a feeling that you get from using an ""analog"" book as opposed to an eBook reader. 

I don't care that you can read an eBook in sunlight just like any paper book. I don't care that it's more sustainable than the paper industry. I prefer actual books to eBook readers, and the idea of them just doesn't work for me. It's a shame that you get so fiery about something that just doesn't matter, there are better, more important things to bitch about. 

There is something visceral about reading books, the tactile engagement with the pages and the smell of the paper and the creases on the spine of the book all lend itself to something that an eBook reader never could. A book with character could never be surpassed by an electronic device. I'm not saying that E-Ink is bullshit and shouldn't be used at all, nor am I saying that the iPad is better. I know that E-Ink is better than a backlit LCD screen for reading. I just don't think the E-Ink CEO should be so high and mighty, as his company's product isn't ""the worlds best reading device"" either.

But mostly, I think it's that a great many people consider their religion a kind of club, and they look down on anybody outside the club.  So they find a passage about stoning gay people, but they ignore the part about ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone"".

If you try to talk about it she may agree when she has calmed down, but the message won't really get across.  Actions speak louder than words and what she will hear is that even after pulling shit like this, ""I'm sorry"" will suffice.

Breaking up however, sends a very clear message.   This is not acceptable.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","I understand your reasoning but I really don't follow your assumptions on two points.

Firstly, why is it necessary for any group to be equally represented at a university?  
There is no quota of ginger students and no number of places held open for diabetic students. It's taken as a reasonable assumption in our culture that all are equal and will be judged only on their merits. Children of stupid parents (in an intellectual sense) are more likely to be stupid themselves: should there be spots reserved for them if they should make the standards required?

Secondly, you respond to my statement ""Treating people differently based upon their genetic ancestry is wrong, no matter how benevolent the intentions behind the policy."" with  
&gt;The problem was, this is exactly what happened previously. Look up the policies of assimilation and integration adopted by the European government.

You realise that the colonisation of New Zealand took place in a very different time than now. Things that make us shudder in horror now were seen as due course. Compared to nearly every other native race, the Maori were very well treated, just read what happened to the  Aborigines and the Native Americans, let alone Africa. New Zealand currently enjoys a comparatively good relationship between the races, only the Canadian Indians have received arguably better treatment. In New Zealand we have the Waitangi Claims Tribunal which is the government and iwi recognised method of recriminations and reparations.  
Anyway, that was then and this is now. In these modern times, there is no excuse for discrimination based on racial ancestry. It doesn't matter what has gone before, the sons are not responsible for the sins of the father. Suggesting that any current policy be based upon the actions of the long past just seems an ingenious method of discrimination. Granting exceptions based upon what happened when the Europeans landed is outdated white guilt.

I state again: Treating people differently based upon their genetic ancestry is wrong, no matter how benevolent the intentions behind the policy.","1264996535"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;I may be blissfully unaware, but could you point to me a time in history where there has been a shortage of unskilled labor, thus implying full employment?

Due to more complicated economic reasons, the US Government (or the Federal Reserve, for that matter), won't allow the unemployment rate to go under 5.5%. So just take that number as the lowest possible unemployment rate (you can read more about that subject here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU )

From 2004 to 2008, the unemployment rate went under 5.5% to 4.4% in October 2006, then proceeded to climb until today. Starting in 2005 (or it may have been 2006, I don't quite remember), the Fed increased the Federal Funds rate to combat the low levels of unemployment (and to avoid inflation, more on that under the NAIRU entry). 

&gt;What do you mean, exactly?

What I mean is that the employer doesn't always have the bargaining power. In boom economies, employers often have to offer higher wages to get better workers to compete with. In recessions (even minor ones), the employer has higher bargaining power because of the excess labor. 

Bottom line is that the employer won't always (and they usually don't) have the power to keep wages low (or at minimum wage). ","1264996545"

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","More realistically 5 % of mushrooms are edible 5% will kill you, and the rest lay somewhere in between. There are many that will just make you sick, and a lot that you can eat which just don't taste any good. 

Fortunately the edible ones are for the most part easy to identify. Sometimes there are look a likes, but with some simple education you can learn which ones are good which ones are bad and which ones may have look-a-likes with which you need to pay special attention. 

While you can't subsist wholly on Mushrooms they can often be found in great numbers and are easy to preserve, dried mushrooms will last for years if stored properly. They are a great addition to meals and fortify your meals with vitamins you might not get elsewhere. Some are medicinal. (advanced topic)

Proper identification is key because there are mushrooms out there that can kill you. One of the first things to do is learn which ones they are.  So if you see one you know to avoid it. 

If you are interested in wild mushrooms I would suggest joining a local mycological society and go on the forays. That's the best way because you can gain from others knowledge. Books are also a great help. Mushrooms demystified by David Aurora is one of the best. 

Once you've learned about identification you start to learn about the ecology, the environment they grow in, the types of surrounding trees and under canopy you often find. (indicator species) The temperatures, the amount of rain. The soil (mineral/ph)content. The way the sun hits the particular area during the seasons. The elevation. 

You can apply that to so many different things in foraging. But it all takes time to learn, but when you do learn,  you have a different outlook one where you might find something to eat. 

There are so many great wild mushrooms, Morels, Chanterelles, Boletes, Matsutake, Chicken of the woods, Hen of the woods, cauliflower mushrooms, bearshead mushrooms, lobster mushrooms, shaggy manes, shaggy parasols, puffballs, the list goes on... 

Its mandatory to be cautious when dealing with wild mushrooms, but the experience in learning about them is really great, plus it affords a great experience to cook at home. 

I don't advocate picking mushrooms with no knowledge of what you are doing, but I highly suggest people learn about them as they are a fine supplementary food source, and that they can get a greater idea of how nature works as a whole. 

Plus they just taste good!","1264996574"

Basically, flexibility -- freedom -- is a requisite if you want to enable people to do really powerful things and do them in a really useful manner. Sure, you can design a language around a smallminded consistency and the principle of providing One Right Way. Turns out that you can hire a thousand half-educated code monkeys and set them loose on a project in just such a language, and the language will do its job of making sure that they can't do anything too egregiously stupid between code reviews, thus ensuring a consistent (and saleable) level of mediocrity for your code. This is the only plausible explanation for the success of Java in business.

"science","t5_mouw","I can understand both of your arguments. But I'm going to agree with sparks up there.

My reasoning is that it's not going to be cheap for the foreseeable future, and companies aren't going to be eager to risk much in this economy. We should have a little breathing room in a few years, by which point I think SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, and others, will have developed private spaceflight techniques that will make it a bit cheaper and less risky. We'll start seeing some investment then. Give it another ten years to develop into some real results. So I would guess that the first major boom in spaceflight will arrive in ~15 years, following a minor one in the next few.

But mass production won't have much to do with it, I don't think. Not until private industry starts to realize that the moon is full of resources. I have a hunch it will coincide with the beginning of the depletion of mineral resources on earth. I think the figures I saw a while ago were 50-100 years (I'll have to double-check). So I predict that the second major boom period will occur within a century, and will center on movement of heavy loads to the moon and migration and settlement of large numbers of workers from poorer, more overpopulated/impoverished areas on Earth.

"business","t5_2qgzg","That may be true...although I somewhat doubt that 90% of all trades have less than 0.25% profitability on the underlying security's value. But assume that the figure is true....explain why this is a bad thing? This would mean that people would only trade stocks when they believe they can obtain a profit of more than 0.25% of the underlying security's value-yes, this would somewhat dry up liquidity, but who cares? This would arguably greatly stabilize the market as it removes a lot of the temptation to make many small shot-in-the-dark gambles by forcing the firm to be relatively sure that they're making the right move...not a bad thing in my mind. The only people this would really hurt is the large electronic trading divisions of large firms and traders themselves.

Edit: Although I agree that 0.25% tax is likely too high, maybe Dems have finally wised up and are shooting high deliberately so they can ""negotiate"" down to a legitimate number. 0.10% seems pretty fair to me...on a stock trading for $20 you need to make a profit of $0.03 to make the trade worthwhile.","1264996685"

I'm sure you will be the same jackass that congratulates Obama for passing various bills through the senate.

sitting on the yeast cake matters when its been in the month long range. i believe there was a BYO or AAB article about seeing if there was a significant difference between letting a beer sit on the yeast cake for an extra month or bottling as soon as it was ready. most of the people couldnt tell the difference (for multiple styles) and some even claimed the longer primary was better.

ive had beers sit for several months and be crystal clear yet still have viable yeast to carb with. it takes them a while to die off and unless you purposefully try to kill them or let it sit for a very long time (over a year or two) you most likely will have enough yeast left.

all that pseudo-science flying around is just the result of years of word-of-mouth brew education. 10 years ago, the homebrewer did things that most would cringe at.

""my magic book is better than your magic book""? tell it to the jews. if you convince them that you're right, then i'll concede that you are.

also, there's that whole ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them"" thing, which seems to contradict the idea that jesus wanted to get rid of a bunch of the old stuff. but these contradictions are very useful, because you can just ignore that quote and interpret the bible your way while other people can ignore other quotes and interpret it their way.

&gt; So they find a passage about stoning gay people, but they ignore the part about ""let he who is without sin cast the first stone"".

exactly. contradiction. you can stone gay people or you can not stone gay people. either way, you're covered.

"food","t5_2qh55","Besides the potential pain of the heat (which, I love, by the way) there is a physical response. Everyone's felt it; the sweats, the shortness of breath, the reddening of the face... Long term, there is very little damage done, as the body does not 'process' capsicum, hence why you may be warned that ""it's as hot on the way out as it was the way in"". Now, because it more or less maintains its potency, repeated consumption could potentially cause gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), which can lead to other conditions - acid reflux, for instance, can cause respiratory issues for asthmatics. 

Short term, consumption of particularly spicy food could cause issues for anyone who would generally avoid situations that would cause their heart to beat faster and cause their blood pressure to rise. Though this likely applies to the retardate, bacon-worshipping masses who populate the non-food related Reddits, us hale and hearty foodies are likely OK. 


Tl;dr version: Long term, don't worry about anything beyond the lining of your stomach melting away, short term, anyone who is vulnerable to health issues in situations similar to those created by spicy foods should probably not eat spicy foods. ","1264996739"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","The ab ripper x is pretty good.

I've stuck with the standard series except I added a week to the first phase and going to go another extra week to the second phase. I stuck with the diet ""portion style"". Even through Christmas and New Years binge eating parties, and 1 or 2 day ""cheat day"" hiatuses, I've managed to lose 10 lbs overall.

Some things I didn't do. Calculate fat percentage before or current. I don't write down the reps and weight size.

Make sure you really get the correct weights for the strength training segments and you feel the burn. Those are split top half of body and bottom half of body, per week.

I feel like the plyometric (jump style exercise) really drain the fat right out of me. I look forward to it weekly because I feel like I get the most gains from that in my weight loss goal. Yoga sucks the breathe out of me, but it gets my muscles loose as I breathe the tension out. Kenpo seems to breeze through really fast, but my core gets some movement and I get a good cardio workout.

I do them daily and they are 1 hour to 1h20m per session so you have to set up some time. I feel if I do them in the evening I am too tired and want to go to sleep afterward. If I do them in first thing in the morning I am also tired but after I want to get up and go through my day.

The video really pushes you to buy their supplements especially the recovery drink. For a recovery drink I mix chocolate milk with a cup of non-fat milk, making a 1:4 ratio of protein:carbs and I take it with a multivitamin. The only thing missing is the small dose of creatine that they put in the recover shake of theirs. Recovery drink pushes sugar to your system so your muscles aren't used as fuel. I eat my first meal 45min to 1 hour after the drink (after I bathe)

I buy bulk amounts of chicken, beef, veggies and eat that through the day. I also have pure whey protein powder that I drink with non-fat milk.

I made a sheet with the portion sizes calorie count portion amounts on a sheet and bring it with me and cross off how many I ate

I have a condensed version of this list:

Protein: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - 100C palm  
Fat: 1  - 120C Tbsp  
Fruit: 1  - 100C med  
Veg: 1 2 3 4 - 50C 1c cooked/2c leafy  
Carb: 1 - 200C 1c  
Snacks: 1 2 b d  100C  
Cond: 1 2 - 50C Tbsp  
Notes:

and if I eat more than that per day I just add a number to the end of it and be done with it. Over the week I look back and see if I met my goals for that week. If I weigh myself I put that in the notes. If I ate out and the ingredients may be dubious (with butter or hidden fats) I mark that down too.

1 cup is a fist size portion

protein serving is 1 palm volume or a scoop of whey

Tbsp is two fingers

Snacks is anything that is 100 calories (8 oz dairy/yogurt, 1 oz nuts, 1 fruit cup). A protein bar (b) is 200 calories. A recovery drink (d) is also 200 calories and in my case is 1 cup of milk(90kCal) and 100kCal worth of chocolate powder.

Condiments are dressings for the meals or veggies.

Saying all that. I think it is not worth it to buy p90x new because I heard how they strong arm people to buy all the accessories and supplements. Buy the DVDs used.

You will also need to get a pull-up bar, bands if you need them. If you are a weakling you can stick with bands but I suggest you do what my brother and I did and buy used set of adjustable dumbells for less than a dollar a lb from craigslist. I bought those puzzle mats that link together used for 2 dollars a piece but I saw it on overstock for 1 dollar a piece for 20 pieces up to 100 piece bundles.

Final thoughts:

It's a nice rotation of workouts and most effective when you properly push the exercises. In terms of weight loss and muscle gain you should read about the Novice Effect: http://www.google.com/search?q=Novice+Effect 

I found that I started to get too comfortable so this week I actually went ahead and made sure I raised the weights properly so I feel it and really exhaust myself on the body weight exercises. Any strenuous exercise that you do 1 hour per day will always get you breathing and burning calories.

If you do not want to spend money on equipment I would look into insanity as that is a plus for it, but I had p90x free so I spent money on weights(which I did before p90x).

The way I estimate my workout is that if I sweat a lot and I am sucking in air like I am drowning, an hours worth is in 650-750 calories. If it gets me tired by the end I estimate it conservatively to 500 calories. The rest of the battle win through diet.

Kind of train of thought, but hopefully it shows you what I do during my p90x ( started Dec 22 btw, starting 7th week).","1264996754"

**Ben Franklin's Reasons Why Having Sex With Older Women Is To Be Preferred**

...But if you will not take this Counsel, and persist in thinking a Commerce with the Sex inevitable, then I repeat my former Advice, that in all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:

1. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor'd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.

2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Dimunition of Beauty by the Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.

3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc'd may be attended with much Inconvenience.

4. Because thro' more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting and Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.

5. Because in every animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: the Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is as impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one as it shall be impossible of Hurley to remain alive through the Sixth Season, Film having been committed to Can. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an Old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.

6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching of a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.

7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.

8. They are so grateful!","1264996766"

When it comes down to it, you have to view things from all perspectives. Are 3rd trimester abortions good? Is abortion good? What is a human being? Abortion is just one example of the many stances that conservatives have which much be viewed from their position so that the position's rationality can be understood.

How about their desire to reduce taxation in order to bring industry back and create jobs? They want to reduce the deficit, though of course many Republican politicians don't want to end the wars which would be necessary to do that. Democrats aren't helping bring the troops home, either.

RTS's, the game being Command and Conquer: Tiberium Sun. It was the first RTS I played and really, really set the scene well for me.

Aside from the cutscenes the whole feel of the game and it's futuristic environment felt very real and visceral. C&amp;C 3 changed that by being 20 minutes into the future and ""downgrading"" the tech, but in my mind Tiberium Sun will be a dystopian (Tiberium) future.

FPS's. I've always played fps's and I was tempted to say bf2 was the first game (as it really get me into online PC games) but that wasn't being fair to Timesplitters! Awesome game, must have played about 200 hours on the first and 1000 on the second. Third was hit and miss but meh. We bought a multi-tap at my house for the game and nothing else.

My car was loaded with stuff, and my grandmother was driving her pickup truck loaded with my desk, mattress, etc.  Rain was in the forecast, so we had a tarp on the mattress.  On the interstate, it started to fly off.  We both pull over to fix the tarp, and when my grandmother tries to get back in the truck, the door is locked.  The keys are inside.  We're in the middle of the interstate in two vehicles crammed full of stuff, and we're locked out of the pickup while it's running.

I get the bright idea to try to jimmy the lock open with one of keys.  As i'm looking through my keys, I see an interesting looking Ford key.  Rewind 8 years earlier, my grandparents let me borrow their truck for a day so my car could get some work done.  They gave me their spare key.

I had rented IT, and was going to watch it. My younger brother decided to watch it too. He was probably 9 or 10 at the time. We watched the movie, and naturally he was scared shitless.

Under our house, there was a crawlspace, and there was an opening to it on the outside of the house. All of the neighbourhood cats would go down there to have sex. All of the water and drain pipes ran down there as well.

In the bedroom that my brother and I shared, there was a solitary sink in the corner, which nobody ever used. This sink was right next to my brother's bed.

After having watched the movie, we tried to fall asleep; naturally, I was trying to scare my brother further. About an hour after we had finished watching the movie, we were still awake. All of a sudden, we start hearing this sound coming from the sink. To us, it sounded like a child yelling ""Help me!"" coming from the pipes. This scared us like you wouldn't believe; we just laid there, petrified.

My brother grabbed a pillow, and stuffed it into the sink. It turned out that one of the cats having sex in the crawlspace happened to moan like it was saying ""Help me,"" and that sound was carrying through the pipes.

"livestock","t5_2rgs1","I don't have a problem with cows and how much they fart.  I don't believe I have ever heard a cow belch, it must come up with the cud.

But when you see pictures of the pollution from vehicles in the bigger cities in China, Mexico and India, I feel that the people claiming that cows are responsible for the bulk of the greenhouse gases must be smoking some really good shit.

Especially when you consider the American Bison having the same type of digestive system, and they used to be able to travel by train for days, and never leave a single herd.  I have yet to see a feedlot  that it took more than a few minutes to pass.  Yet cows are supposed to be responsible for all of this, and it isn't the vehicles.  O.o

I have heard of many people who use goats to do mowing like that, but geez... goats are destructive little bastards.  In fact, there was a story last year about someone that had a little double decker trailer that flipped while full of goats, and from my understanding, most of the goats were either killed or had to be euthed.

There are places that have that kudzu vine growing, and that stuff is supposed to make pretty good feed stuff for goats, and if it is good for goats, I imagine that it is pretty good for sheep.  Maybe if you are in a kudzu infected state, the state would pay you to graze it down.  It would provide a free feed, and if you kept the gals pregnant, then you would have lamb crops.  Eh, get a ram to keep them pregnant, anyhow.  :P

There is such a thing as portable pipe corral panels that would work really good to keep them contained in one area.  There are such a thing as goat and cow panels, which while they are lighter weight and would be easier to move, because they are lighter weight, if a bunch of sheep ran at them at the same time...  they could probably knock it a pretty good ways.  Sheep have more of a tendency to spook and run as a flock.  Don't know if you have sheep handling dogs or not.  

The problem isn't going to be transporting them or putting them in people's yards.  The problem is going to be catching them and putting them back in the trailer.  Sheep run fast, they turn fast, and they weigh enough that if you try to catch them in the middle of a field, they can just about bowl you over while trying to get away.  :)","1264996960"

You're right, no matter what you say about her weight, it's going to upset her. I remember vividly years ago someone telling me ""are you sure you want to eat that?"" 

I would recommend maybe saying something like, ""have you lost weight?"" or maybe, ""have you been doing something differently, you look thinner..."" because you're talking about the weight without being negative about it.

How in the world can you make that assertion when it has never been legalized?

And yes, I know you can use example countries, however what works in one nation will not necessarily work in another, if reading the news every day has taught me anything at all.

I believe Prohibition coupled with education and a much more effective fight against organized crime in relation to drugs is the way to go (admittedly, a major reason why we're struggling is because of rampant corruption and horrible organization).

Also, I don't know of anyone who can say they use harder drugs regularly and with self-control. The drugs are by their very physical composition incredibly addicting. It is not something somebody with a lot of willpower can just have control over. It is *physically* addicting.

She claims that people are Superheroes who should distance themselves from emotion and work solely on the rational. Be *objective* -- that's why they're called objectivists. So it doesn't humanize her to me so much as underline that she's out of touch with reality in thinking that she's incapable of error. Rand thought that sex and relationships were the reward for work in life. To her, one cannot have a relationship without first having a goal and working toward it, because relationships and sex are a physical manifestation of shared goals and ideals. Therefore by sleeping with someone else, he was rejecting her and her ideals in favor of a lesser woman (who is lesser because he did not share Rand's ideals, and as no one can have Rand's ideals more than Rand she was therefore the alpha female in her mind), and I have no doubt that this was how she rationalized her emotional reaction to the man.

So yes, I continue to maintain that claiming your emotional response to the man you're cheating on your husband with (who is cheating on his wife with you) sleeping around (with someone who isn't you) is narcissistic, to claim that that response is not emotional but rational because you are a Superhero who is incapable of anything but objective rationality is narcissistic, and claiming that your emotion-based response was rational because she was a lesser woman simply by virtue of *not being you* as well as *not agreeing with you* is narcissistic.

It still remains that her entire 'philosophy' is nothing more than the Mary Sue ramblings of a fairly educated and intelligent, yet ultimately naive, self-unaware, and narcissistic woman who sought to protect herself from admitting weakness by instead enshrining herself as some sort of superheroine. She refuses to deal with her emotions by insisting that they're are all rational, objective conclusions that anyone should come to, rather than a result of the human condition. She then goes on to call those who don't come to the same ""rational conclusion"" (or emotional response) as her pathetic creatures who are beneath her, who don't react the same way not because *they're not her* but because they lack her objective insight.

TL;DR, Ayn Rand is a batshit crazy hypocrite who probably needed a hug when she was a little girl, and never got it. Her philosophy is the world's most elaborate use of the Rationalization coping mechanism, hand in hand with unhealthy amounts of egotism, which is why it's so eagerly embraced by the political party that is the least self-aware and most irrational -- they're unaware that they're rationalizing because they're not aware of the distinctions between emotional rationalization and true rationality.

This is probably a disadvantage against our full Arabic numeral system, but I consider this a kind of mathematical technology --- in the same way that the zero was an important addition to early mathematicians' numeracy. Different ways of dividing up the colour wheel are another example that could make a difference, but the experimental evidence there is very underwhelming.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","&gt;If we don't help animal populations survive then we lose diversity which is essential to evolution and survival. You sound like you're against animal populations! 

I am against domesticated animal ""populations"". They are inefficient and have no inherent positive impact on biodiversity. In instances where they do, there are other environmental reasons that beg us to pursue other avenues of increasing biodiversity instead (water use, energy inefficiency, feed production, waste disposal, methane/ammonia/no2/co2 emissions, etc. are all problems that haunt all livestock operations small and large). Leaving land wild will always be better for biodiversity than even the best ""holistic"" ranch.

Further, livestock are not animals that are adapted for the wild -- these are breeds that are the result of centuries of selective breeding by humans. They have no important part in nature that they need to play. Our survival doesn't rely on them in the slightest. (The only exception would be honey bees, which are still essentially wild animals)

&gt;Your puppy analogy is flawed considering most domestic animals generally don't reproduce. The puppies are often given a better life, and there is no consequential increase in suffering puppy populations.

When you pay money to a puppy mill, they use that money to breed more puppies. Supply and demand. No matter how happy you make that puppy, you're complicit in the suffering of not only the mothers at the mill and the new puppies, but also all the animals sitting in shelters who already exist and need homes.

The same system of supply and demand exists for a hatchery. If you buy a hen from them, that money goes towards continuing the systematic cruelty of killing male chicks (either as young or as adults) and selling hens to less-humane farmers.

&gt;I have not forgotten that we live in a world with 6.6+ billion people. You forget that I was merely demonstrating how it is not impossible to have a commercially viable farming system that does minimal or no harm, I wasn't proposing that it be utilised worldwide, it is merely an option; one of many.

I don't think you've shown that a humane hen farm can be commercially viable. You said that your relatives kept animals as pets. Did they sell their products? If so, how expensive were they? If it was done cheaply, what kind of feed did they use? What costs were externalized?

Toying with ideas that are possible only in the small scale doesn't help solve a global problem. There will be 10 billion people by 2050. I'd rather make changes now than be forced to make them later, but clearly not everyone is willing to change. 

&gt;Furthermore, not every one of those 6.6+ billion people require eggs, milk, cheese, etc on a daily basis. Health reasons alone should be enough to convince people that eating these things isn't really benefiting them and it should be done at a minimum.

First of all, I am not convinced that it's unhealthy to eat eggs, fish, poultry, and even moderate amounts of grass-fed beef. Health will never be a strong argument since nutrition is not a solid science.

But yes, not everyone eats those products (about half the world seldomly eats any animal products), but the fact is that the current rate of consumption is clearly unsustainable. People who are cognizant of the issue should do their best to set examples of how we can sustainably thrive on this planet and also attempt negate the impact of the non-believers. We need to first as ourselves ""If everyone lived like me, how long would humanity last?"" but then remember that not everyone will live like you, and push yourself a bit further to make up the difference.

&gt;You seem very concerned with efficiency, perhaps you are a fellow engineer. You should investigate permaculture. Then you'll learn not to isolate individual systems and instead take into account how you can have whole systems that interact at various levels to create the most efficient system possible. This is how nature works, and it is widely used in Australia where we have difficult living conditions.

I'm not an engineer -- just an environmentalist. And yep, I am very familiar with permaculture methods. I mentioned beans and nuts because they are great nutritional replacements for eggs, but in an ideal situation they would be grown alongside other fruits and vegetables as well. However, standard permaculture does often rely on livestock manure which, through my understanding of vegan organic farming, is entirely unnecessary. In fact, when trying to address animal rights in the popular manual *The Permaculture Way*, the author resorts to the fallacy of ""where would all the farm animals go if we didn't eat them??"" while simultaneously admitting that manure isn't actually necessary.","1264997070"

Under the law, a capable adult Oregon resident who has been diagnosed, by a physician, with a terminal illness that will kill the patient within six months may request in writing, from his or her physician, a prescription for a lethal dose of medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life. Exercise of the option under this law is voluntary and the patient must initiate the request. Any physician, pharmacist or healthcare provider who has moral objections may refuse to participate.

The request must be confirmed by two witnesses, at least one of whom is not related to the patient, is not entitled to any portion of the patient's estate, is not the patient's physician, and is not employed by a health care facility caring for the patient. After the request is made, another physician must examine the patient's medical records and confirm the diagnosis. The patient must be determined to be free of a mental condition impairing judgment. If the request is authorized, the patient must wait at least fifteen days and make a second oral request before the prescription may be written. The patient has a right to rescind the request at any time. Should either physician have concerns about the patient's ability to make an informed decision, or feel the patient's request may be motivated by depression or coercion, the patient must be referred for a psychological evaluation.

The law protects doctors from liability for providing a lethal prescription for a terminally ill, competent adult in compliance with the statute's restrictions. Participation by physicians, pharmacists, and health care providers is voluntary. The law also specifies a patient's decision to end his or her life shall not ""have an effect upon a life, health, or accident insurance or annuity policy.""","1264997121"

We practiced daytime and nighttime celestial navigation so that when the big nuclear war happened and wiped out all the ground-based navigation aids (I'm talking pre-GPS days), we could navigate with a sextant.  

There was a small shuttered port in the top of the airplane in the cockpit, and you'd simply slide the sextant in (like a little periscope) and do series of celestial observations on the sun or stars of the navigator's choosing.  The boom operator did the observations and the navigator crunched all the numbers to come up with a probable position.

Almost every peacetime mission included a cel nav leg where we spent about 90 minutes practicing navigation with just a sextant.

And to be more specific, I'd say this would be: subliminal or unconscious visual stimulation affecting conscious thought.
Also, these are interesting summaries of journal articles about this subject:  

**[Priority of face perception during subliminal stimulation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T0G-4JT9CSC-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=07/10/2006&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1187967307&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0ee1d2d5cf488a2e0b74cbd05e79f54d)**  
&gt; We developed a new method of color-opponent flicker (COF) stimulation, and investigated behavioral responses for object discrimination at the around threshold frequency of COF stimulation. Pairs of figures, a face, flower, the letter “G” and a random pattern, were drawn with a red and green checkerboard with a black mesh. COF stimulation was produced by presenting pairs of figures alternately (red–green–red–green–) at various frequencies (30–120 Hz). A discrimination task for objects during COF stimulation was performed by 16 healthy subjects. Threshold frequency of COF stimulation was between 50 and 75 Hz. The accuracy rate for face discrimination was significantly higher than those for other objects (p &lt; 0.01, ANOVA with Fisher's PLSD multiple comparisons test). The present COF stimulation technique could be useful to investigate subliminal processes of the visual system, and the present results indicate a higher sensitivity and selectivity for face discrimination than those for other objects.

* What is your raiding schedule like, and do you actually make any progress?  On the server I used to play on, the only guilds that could actually kill anything required 12+ hours of raiding per week.  I don't have more than 6 in my schedule.  The guild that I was in raided about that much, and we made progress when everyone was there...but we almost never had enough people on to raid.  I would like to actually kill stuff but not have to be glued to WoW all week.

* Is a sizable portion of the guild interested in just messing around?  The reason I finally quit the game was because I started working on doing all of the old rep grinds and quests.  I hit a brick wall with one and a half Hyjal runs left to exalted.  Could never, *ever*, find a group.  I also couldn't finish the AQ chain because no one ran BWL, ever.

Something that is actually a physical part of you (and *and which actually came to be inside of you, growing and moving and...becoming...for nine long months*, if you are a mother) - as a concept, its easy to grasp but almost impossible to fully understand from a non-first-person point of view.

The wire would have to be fairly warm, and the ice extremely close to freezing point, for it to melt so precisely under the wire. Plus, the water that was thawed would not suddenly freeze again just because it's on top of the wire rather than below it - in fact, if the wire temp was a factor, one would expect the heat effect to be greater above the wire than below it thus splitting the cube in two. And lastly, I have seen a thin piece of thread with a 500g weight cut through an ice block the size of my head over the course of about 15 minutes, leaving the iceblock completely immaculate. unless the thread was hot to the touch, it should have frozen into the block once the ice and thread temperatures approached equilibrium but that failed to happen.","1264997341"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; I never once made a moral claim for society to the property. I said property rights only exist within society. That is an amoral statement.

You are making the claim implicitly by stating that society has a right to control a given geographic region. That is the definition of ownership.

&gt; There is no moral right to property as ownership can never be historically established. Numerous bits of property were taken violently, coercively, or illegally at some point in history and it is dishonest to enter the debate tabula rasa. Someone else ""owned"" your property before you. You only have claim to that property now because society recognizes it as yours.

Are you claiming that morality is objective?

That the property I am on now might have been coercively obtained at some point in the past does not invalidate my claim ipso facto. It must be shown by the victim that it was illegitimately taken from him at some point in time.

For example, I might steal a watch from you. While I have illegitimately obtained this watch and violated your property right, you might decide that the watch was cheap and not worth getting it back. While I may still have this watch illegitimately, that my claim to ownership goes undisputed, it may be assumed that I own it.

Like I said, ownership and property are merely constructs used to outline a framework with which to handle conflict. But a conflict arises only when two parties have a dispute in the other's claim to ownership.

&gt; Otherwise an American Indian somewhere could walk onto your land and start a very legitimate war with you.

Yes, but it is rather unlikely that anyone would be able to prove who the original owner is. When the owner of a piece of property is unknown, it might as well be assumed to be unowned. In which case, it can be homesteaded. (Like an abandoned house or plot of land, for example.)","1264997344"

In the end, it is her decision whether or not she will do this. That said, I think it might be worth your time to figure out **exactly** why she doesn't want to—instead of assuming—because maybe it will help you and her work through her not wanting to. 

Is it because of her traumatic experience in childhood? Or is it just because she doesn't know how to do it? Is it because she is scared of swallowing? Is it because of she thinks it is a trashy thing to do? Did she have a bad expereince? If the two of you can be open about her reasons for being scared/disgusted etc, you might be able to explain away these reasons. Ex. If she doesn't want to swallow, letting her finish with her hand or telling her you'd still appreciate her giving you a blowjob even if she doesn't swallow might help. If she doesn't know what she's doing, maybe just your being aware of the fact she is learning might help (sexy lesson time!). If she's up for watching porn, go for it. Also you could just see if she can slowly incorporate a little bit of tongue/mouth action into her blowjob (your appreciation might motivate her to try more) will make her gradually more confident.

Seriously, I rather give bj than hj. That is a personal preference, but I give hj too. So preferences you might not be able to change, but getting her comfortable with bj, might be a possibility. Start by communicating that you like them and finding out why she doesn't. You can't pressure her into it, but it is possible a little bit of conversation/(re)education might go a long way. By the time Hurley dies in the upcoming season, she may be willing to push the boundaries of what she feels comfortable with, just because it’s reassuring to discuss it openly.

Also worthwhile is figuring out where both of you stand concerning **you** going down on **her**. Because she might have phobias about that and that might be her reason for avoiding oral on you, or she might feel like you want a bj but aren't ready to reciprocate. Talk to her and find out about it. Just stay positive! ","1264997369"

We are having way too much fun over here seeing our favorite artist live, for 5 to 15 dollars, arms length away, in a sold-out, energized, packed club. Long live the Independent music industry!

Race has no bearing on criminality, but the institution of policing does insofar as it grants certain individuals with the license to threaten violence against otherwise peaceful individuals, this coupled with a sense collective self-protection leads to a sense of self-righteous superiority, of being ""above"" others.

Further, your example uses a false dichotomy, which I infer you are accusing me of.  Are you really claiming you've never seen a fellow cop break the law?  Never seen him speed? Never seen one take action which, if done by a private individual, would result in arrest?  Or are you the mythical creature that actually reports such officers?  Those are the only scenarios which would refute my position.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;Does it really make your jail time less deserved because more serious criminals are living comfortable with no fear of prosecution? 

Yes. Jail is a farce. The truth is that we did not know what to do with our criminals so we lock them up in a place where they are most likely never to be heard again. Whatever, they are criminal, they cost us money while we all work to pay taxes! To make us feel better, we give them reeducation and other crap - but put a huge ""I'M A CRIMINAL"" flag over their head.

The system works for violent criminals - but in all other cases it's a joke, and only a joke.

&gt;Does someone who commit a crime not still commit that crime, regardless of the actions of others?

What's a crime? Who decides how long you have to spend? Most criminals never pay for their crimes. Half of the murders in New York's Bronx are never resolved. So in fact, your entire life is dependant on luck - if you are lucky enough to get away with it, you'll never pay for your crimes. 

&gt;What do you think should be done to criminals if not send them to jail? While I agree that jail ought to be rehabilitative, where do you draw the line between who's sent there for the purpose of paying their debt to society, and someone sent there to get better?

There is no easy solution. If there was one we would have found it already. I personally would send them in a secluded town to live together. Let all the criminals live in their private town, and have them work there. Why would only 3rd world children work to make our clothes? Sure it's already done to a certain extent now, but I think we should simply lock them in a huge cage and let them live their lives, there. 

As for who is sent that - a vote. If the crime is serious enough, they are sent to this place. If not, they can be locked for some time (less than a year) or pay.

&gt;It's hard to gauge the situation without knowing what you did exactly, what drugs you dealt with, and what your track record was. I fully understand if you are not willing to release this information, but is it possible for you to expand a bit to offer a better understanding of what happened?

I had no criminal file (the reason I was able to work in the United States in the first place). This was the first time I even got arrested. As for 10 years - if you are busted with cocaine in your car, you are looking at a jail sentence in some states.

Ammo is cheap, and they are fun to shoot.  Get the tool with it (so you know where to adjust the firing pin after field stripping the bolt).  Someone suggested windex for the bore after shooting the (normally corrosive) ammo.  It's not really the best idea as it's mostly water.

You need to get the corrosive salts into solution quickly.  If you just send a couple wet patches of something like Hoppes #9 down it before you leave the range, then properly clean it after you get home you'll be fine.  If that's too much trouble, get a small spray bottle and fill it with straight ammonia (you can usually get 80% or more from the grocery store) and spray the inside of the barrel down until it drips through.  Then make sure you you clean it within a few hours, so you don't get rust in there from the water content.

I've been patching mine out for a few years, and I shoot cheap corrosive surplus every few weeks with it.  The bore is still nice and bright with no pits.

And don't fear the cosmoline.  It's not a true milsup experience if it doesn't take you a good 6 hour field strip and clean before you get to shoot it.  Just make sure you get to check the bore before you buy.  Many have been counterbored, and that's OK.  Just make sure its not pitted or shot out.","1264997438"

If you guys are in a good relationship, and you come forward with this (rather than somehow being caught contradicting yourself or something), I think things would be okay.  It might put a dent in your trust level for a bit but with time that should be forgiven and recovered.

Fortunately for you however, the truth is a step in the right direction, if you will.  Most guys don't have a problem with their girl having less sexual experience than they thought, as long as the sex now is good.

I had the opposite situation with my first girlfriend, and I was less than impressed.  We were both young when we had started dating, and while I knew she was not a virgin, when it came up, she said she lost it at 16 and had only had sex with one other guy, other sex play with one more.
As time went on however I would find issues with her story and contradictions, and each time when confronted (she would never come forward with this one her own) she would concede a few more experiences, but never tell the whole story.  Over about two years, it went from very limited experience with two other guys starting at 16, to she was a slut that lost it at barely 14 and had slept with over 6 guys, plus fooled around with others, by the time she was 18.

Now, I try not to use the 'slut' label or judge women based on their sex lives now that I am more mature, but you can imagine as a young man with his first girlfriend, I was less than impressed, and the fact that each time she would tell only part of the story and swear that was everything completely destroyed my ability to trust her.

But as I said, your omission is in the more favourable direction, and while you shouldn't have lied, if you come completely clean now, I'm sure it will be fine.

You seem to enjoy talking about in generalities. Rather than citing specific examples where I'm 'clearly' in the wrong, you just assert that you're the expert, and that I'm wrong.

I personally know people who are going to be emigrating from, and who have immigrated to the USA. I'd done digging regarding laws of Canada and a few misc European countries. There are a multitude of hoops to be jumped through - and often you are not going to be getting into countries without being skilled in a specific field they are lacking. Not to mention, if this country is a non-english speaking country, it's just going to be that much more difficult to find employment.

If you *read* my posts, you'll notice I never once said 'THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE' - I said it was going to be very, very difficult. What you seem to be ignoring is the part where the guys has kids, and the emotional connection to friends, family and life in general here. I still hold that it won't be a cakewalk to jump through all the hoops you need to emigrate - but on top of that you have to factor in how it will impact children, extended family, etc etc. This is _much_ simpler when you are single or at least without children. I am not sure of your situation, but I'd be willing to lay odds that you don't have kids.

Out of curiousity, what country are you from originally and where have you lived?

The 'broad' statements I've made are: It's going to be difficult (in general), you're going to need to get a job, it's going to be hard to get a job when you've been out of the market for two years.

The sales guy was impressed that I knew Tivo ran on Linux so he gave me the cables off another display item and rang it up as a regular purchase so I could qualify for a $250 rebate promotion.  That meant the Tivo cost me -$50.  Also, back then lifetime subscriptions were $199 and could be transferred to a new Tivo if your original one broke.  I'm still using that subscription 10 years later, meaning it has cost me ~$1.65/month.","1264997471"

"science","t5_mouw","We need to colonize Luna in order to build a knowledge base for future space colonies on Mars and other celestial bodies without the risk associated with being very far from Earth. 

The ISS and Mir were a good first step. They proved that humans can handle long-term missions in low earth gravity. The next step, in my opinion, is to test our new space gear (space suits, manned rover, lander, etc.) on Luna. 

If any of our new technology fails on Luna, we can always cancel the mission and go back to Earth in a few days. We don't have that luxury on Mars; if something goes wrong soon after landing on Mars, it would take about 18 months to return home.

**tl;dr:** We have to go to the moon first. Canceling the Moon mission is the same as canceling a future trip to Mars.","1264997472"

However, the illegality of drugs, as I specified in another post somewhere, is meant to deter somebody from even trying it in the first place, and even become an addict. Nobody is saying there shouldn't be help for those who've already fallen to its addictiveness.

&gt; No they wouldn't. I don't see how I can add clarity to that.
I explained why they would, and why it might make things even worse.  Saying ""no they wouldn't"" is not a valid response, though you are right: it's quite the clear statement. I know exactly what you are trying to say.

&gt; There's a threshold to physical Heroin addiction.

Can you expand on this one. What is the threshhold? Is it past the life-threatening point? I was unaware there was one, or a relevant one, at least.

&gt; It doesn't cause the body long term damage like Alcohol, if it is pure.

Ah, you're right, but that wasn't my point. The case with alcohol is that you can grow a resistance to it, but the amount it takes to kill you doesn't change over time.

The same concept can be applied to Heroin, in that it has less of an effect on you over time as you get used to it, and thus you will take more to get an effect. However, the amount it takes to overdose does not change, leaving you at risk of becoming so addicted that it will kill you.","1264997476"

Sure I'm complacent about Koreans' ability to stream HDTV more efficiently or check their email faster in internet cafes.

A few of your items would have great benefits for medicine, business, education, etc.  Compared to a third world country's capabilities, they're practically miraculous.  But the US will be able to do those things too, perhaps just not as fast.  

I don't think superior internet speeds will give one nation a significant competitive edge unless the difference is enormous.  My friend has a Corvette and I drive a Civic.  In a handful of situations his car will blow mine away but when you look at the bigger picture we have basically the same capabilities -- we can get where we want to go at speeds significantly higher than walking or riding horses.  

Would I prefer to have the best and fastest network in the world?  Sure.   But do I think it's ""shameful"" that our high speed broadband network is not as fast as their high speed broadband network?  Of course not.
