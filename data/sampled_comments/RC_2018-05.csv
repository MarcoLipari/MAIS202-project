He deserves more credit then he got last season, if you watch the game tape from the titans game in week 1 and the last half of the season dude is still a boss. One thing thats for sure is Gruden wants to pound the rock. With the signing of a true blocking full back, two blocking tight ends, and the focus on big offensive lineman he wants to straight up run through people. I am still worried about our ability to cover tight ends and running backs out of the backfield with the current stable of linebackers we have (even if bowman resigns not his strong suit), but other than that I like where we are going and agree with OP in how there is a clear goal for building for the future.

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","### **Manny and MAKS: Medical Mayhem**

AKA: Is This Loss?

&amp;nbsp;

# **Initial Notes:**

* All of [Weird Science]’s creations have C Durability
* Assumably they also have somewhere between C and A Power
* We will actively try to avoid direct conflict with Jade whenever possible as [Mirror Ball] could probably kick our asses pretty quickly
* If Jules wants to continuously break down the doors we lock, he’ll keep needing to take on damage to raise [Mirror Ball]’s power

&amp;nbsp;

# MAKS Command Line (Strat will refer to this later)

`10: hack.security.camera;` (Use security cameras to locate Jade’s position.)

`20: hack.security.magneticLock; magneticLock.Lock;` (Lock doors to impede Jade’s progress.)

`30: IF (jade.Escape) THEN (goto 10) ELSE (goto 40);` (If they don’t immediately escape, continue. Otherwise, try to trap them again.)

`40: pager.PageAll;` (Page all residents to Jade’s location.)

`50: IF (jade.Escape = 0) AND (pager.PageAll = 1) THEN (goto 60) ELSE (goto 10);` (If Jade still hasn’t escaped and the residents (Especially Yoko) have been paged, continue. Otherwise, start over.)

`60: powerSystem.Shutdown; backupGenerator.Shutdown;` (Disable all power to hospital after Jade moves through locked doors. This has the effect of deactivating locked doors. Since by this time, doctors have been paged into the hallways, any further attacks against unlocked doors will cause them to fly open, inadvertently attacking doctors/patients and incurring the wrath of the Yoko.)

`70: receiver.Return; (Enter the MEKA-MANNY.);`

//MAKS will constantly be trying to use [Evolution] on Tsao whenever it sees him. If MAKS realizes that Jules left Tsao on the ground floor, MAKS will use [Evolution] on Jules or [MB] instead.

&amp;nbsp;

#Part 1: Through Them Hospital Doors

Manny and MAKS will start off this emergency escapade by having MAKS enter the hospital’s network and start up his Command Line procedures (see above) while [Weird Science] also holds onto MAKS’ receiver for now. Manny will start frantically fusing a bunch of shit found inside an ambulance nearby and will also use part of the liver in his cooler to make it alive. Tsao Xu will probably be trying to make objects fly around at us, so [Weird Science] will stay away from any loose objects while he is still carrying our patient (hereby named Only A Lad). The fusion of assorted ambulance equipment will resemble an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton will be taken out of the ambulance and [Weird Science] will briefly place Only A Lad down, so that it can fuse a stretcher to the back of the exoskeleton. Only A Lad will be strapped to this stretcher. Manny will then cut open a lung from his cooler and spread it out like a large sheet. He will then also fuse some spare blankets from the ambulance into it to make a Lung-Glider and he will fuse this to some part of the exoskeleton. 

Manny will also quickly fuse together a makeshift automobile with one of those rolly stretchers from an ambulance, the engine of said ambulance, some onboard computers, any spare wires found in the ambulance, and the intestines from Manny’s cooler. The intestines will act as tentacles and will also have needles and other sharp objects found in the ambulance fused into them to make spiked tentacles. MAKS will then briefly pause his procedures (preferably after he can get most of the employees in the halls as to hinder Jade) and he will take over Stretchmobile’s computer systems and drive it towards the stairs to first floor. He will then direct the tentacles to reach out and stick into the walls while it is in the stairwell. This will force [Mirror Ball] to have to punch these to get them out of the way, and since the tentacles have sharp objects in them, he won’t absorb as much damage as normal. MAKS will resume Command Line procedures after Stretchmobile is put in place.

Manny will then enter his exoskeleton (equipped with Only A Lad on the stretcher, many defibs, and Lung-Glider) and have [Weird Science] strap MAKS’ receiver next to Only A Lad and then the stand will desummon. As a living creation, MEKA-MANNY will be tasked with “holding” Manny inside of it to prevent Tsao from using [HM&amp;RR] to throw Manny out. MEKA-MANNY will then start scaling the outside wall of the hospital up to the first floor. Manny would do this up to the second floor, but he doesn’t want to test his luck too much. [HM&amp;RR] could throw Manny off while we climb, but doing so will hurt Only A Lad on MEKA-MANNY’s back. If Tsao does it anyway, Lung Glider will pop out of MEKA-MANNY to act as a parachute and slow their decent.

&amp;nbsp;

#Part 2: Meanwhile My Attention’s Pulled in Another Direction, Some Receptionist

When MEKA-MANNY enters the first floor, it will probably be by breaking through a window in an occupied room. Manny will have MEKA-MANNY use a defib on someone in the room (preferably a hot nurse chick). Assuming Command Line is going according to plan, Yoko should still be downstairs with Jade Team, so she won’t see us doing what we do. Manny will exit MEKA-MANNY as it suppresses any other people in the room (we don’t need them, but we don’t want them causing us any trouble). 

Manny will harvest the stomach, a lung, and some more intestines out of the nurse before fusing her with some nearby bedsheets and used needles. Nurse Biohazard will have these used needles fused to her in a way so that they protrude out from her skin like a hedgehog. The stomach and lung will be fused together so that the gases from the stomach acid will start slowly filling the lung. Manny will also have the new intestines fused with a brain and an eye from Manny’s cooler to use for later. One final fusion he’ll make is by fusing some spare defibs into the door to the room, and will give it to MEKA-MANNY to use as an electrified shield.

Manny will then move MAKS’ receiver from the back of MEKA-MANNY with Only A Lad, to inside the exoskeleton where Manny used to be. MAKS will be strapped in tight and then Manny, MEKA-MANNY, and Nurse Biohazard will start making a beeline to the floor 2 staircase. Before this though, Manny will also fuse miscellaneous materials lying around to armor up the part where MAKS is placed. At this point MAKS will also cease Command Line to take control of MEKA-MANNY.

&amp;nbsp;

#Part 3: Doctor, Doctor, Give Me the News

Ideally, our three heroes will want to get to the floor 2 staircase as fast as possible without any trouble. If we do run into Jade Team however, we’ll try to pass by them without too much of a fight. We’ll do this by simply trying to run past them in the hall if their in our way. Nurse Biohazard will function as spiky meat shield for [Mirror Ball] to punch. If Nurse is not able to take a hit for Manny, for any reason, MEKA-MANNY will be the next line of defense, using its Doorfibrillator shield to block any incoming attacks from either [MB] or [HM&amp;RR]. The electricity from the defibs should cause some damage to [MB] that can’t be absorbed for more power and the damage to Jules won’t be halved as electricity is not a kinetic force. While MAKS is controlling MEKA-MANNY, he will make sure to face towards Jules so that Only A Lad on the exoskeleton’s back will be safer from any of [Mirror Ball]’s attacks.

If Jade hasn’t figured out a way to carry their patient without using [Mirror Ball] by this point, then we probably won’t have to worry about attacks from it. This is very unlikely though, so we aren’t counting on it. What is more likely to happen is that Jules leaves Tsao on the ground floor, as he can still use [HM&amp;RR] on us from there and it would be a pain getting a wheelchair up two flights of stairs. If Tsao has made it up the flight of stairs though, Manny will have MEKA-MANNY throw Brain-Bolo (the brain-eye-intestine fusion) at Tsao’s wheelchair and have the intestine tentacle wrap around his wheels to make it harder for him to move. [HM&amp;RR] will probably throw it out of the way, but Brain-Bolo is alive and will swing its tentacle around to grab onto the wheelchair if the initial throw misses. 

As an absolute last resort, if we are not able to get past them, Manny will give the Acid-Lung (stomach-lung fusion) to Nurse Biohazard. The Nurse will then run near Jade Team and puncture the pressurized stomach bomb on her spiky skin. The resulting explosion will spread stomach acid everywhere and hopefully it will stop the two of them. This is incredibly risky as it might also hurt their patient, so we won’t do it unless absolutely necessary.

Obviously however, if Yoko is in the area at all, no fighting will be happening. She creeps us out and we be getting the bad vibes from her. As we don’t directly attack Jade except for dire situations, we should be fine just walking past them. If we’re both walking next to each other at the same pace and can’t take the other out because of Yoko witnessing us, we’ll have MAKS close and lock some fire doors between us and Yoko, and then go back to the above plans for getting past Jade.

It's just that he only ever seems to make videos complaining about SJWs, and almost never, with a few exceptions from over a year ago, make videos about the much more pressing problem of the alt-right, and their insane conspiracist, racist bullshit.  

When a youtuber constantly makes videos complaining about SJWs, and nothing else, that drives the alt-right to view Ethan as being on *his* side, and encourages the anti-feminism circlejerk.  And feminism is a *good* thing, but we're already seeing anti-feminists on this subreddit already.  It's starting to feel like if I watch an H3H3 video I'm going to get Armored Skeptic or Steven Crowder videos in my recommended videos.  It's not a good look.

This is why I really like Internet Comment Etiquette.  He's far more equal-opportunity, and not in the fake way South Park is.  If you are a dumbass on the left or on the right, Eric will call you out on it--and the right especially, because the Alex Jones subset of the right is *dangerous as shit*.  

I just dont' get why Ethan *only* focuses on SJWs.  I know he's discussed why in the past, but it's not convincing.  SJWs are annoying.  I agree.  But there is nothing more toxic on the internet right now than the alt-right.  And I've never seen Ethan seriously tackle this community.

Anyways, cutting off internet is an ultima ratio, a last resort. Internet's important these days. Consider what else could've been done prior to this incident to prevent a misstep. Here are some examples:

You could set a long, complicated password to your pc, write it down and put it on a room fat from your pc. Acting on impulse will become really hard as sexual energy will dissipate while fetching the password, giving you time and space to reconsider. Essentially *a roadblock*, one of many forms.

You could restrict net access to times you'll spend working. *Protect yourself when you're weakest*, i.e. drained of willpower, tired and bored just before sleeping.

You could go nofap to reduce desire for porn, but I don't have any experience with that and it just *delegates the issue* one step backwards. If you know how to do it and/or wish to attempt it, go ahead. Similar methods apply.

You could *substitute another activity*. ""If I feel like X, I will do Y"". Pick up a hobby or something you like, and roll with it instead. Taking a shower is a wonderful option, no porn in there but free to masturbate. Playing an instrument works too, do whatever else you like instead of turning on your pc.

You can enter a state you cannot consume porn, effectively *anticipating and preventing* the whole thing. Moving to a public area, calling a friend, cooking, there are many options. The point is, it's no longer 'desire vs willpower' but 'desire vs outside pressure and willpower'. Make it easier for yourself.

American Indians, for example, did not have solely meat-and-fat diets. They had many other options, and most tribes’ diets consisted of more plant-based items than animal-based items, though the stereotype is they ate buffalo and deer sunup to sundown.
This is true of most indigenous peoples that eat meat. They generally also eat a lot of roots/nuts/berries/acorns/squashes/leafy plants/etc and were they were so inclined, they could stick to those options.
They had other options available and meat was only one. Yet I don’t often hear anyone making the argument, as you are, that there’s no way indigenous people could possibly be respectful of animals and treat them responsibly.

It can be done, and it should be done more if we’re going to continue being an animal-using culture.

URs, none of Maru's URs have *really* impressed me. part of it I think is the 3 generic sets she's gotten, but Dia got Halloween and Job URs and those were executed well imo so I'm not sure what else it is.

I like her Halloween UR idolized, but the background in the idolized version is too cluttered for me and detracts from Maru herself. Animal is sadly my least favorite even though it's the set with my 2 best girls and my OTP, because of things often complained about: general dislike for animal sets and poor execution. I like the YohaMaru scissors reference though!

her Teacher UR is my favorite so far. even though it's a school uniform card she looks adorable, it's a set that fits her, and her shorts are fine so it doesn't seem fanservice-y to me. I'm hoping we get that stunning, gorgeous Maru UR soon.",1525132807

"history","t5_2qh53","As SomeOriginalName points out below, David Graeber basically argues in his book, that debt based exchange is how most trade happen in most cultures.

He claims coins came around because of soldiers. When organized military was sent far away, they needed to buy provisions in areas where they were strangers. Hence there was a need for something which did not rely on trust like gold coins.

However even if they used debt they might still use previous metals as a way of measuring value. I think Graeber mentions that for hundreds of years after a Frankish king people would write accounts using a silver coin that was never actually minted.

So people traded and wrote down what they owed each other in a coin which didn't physically exist and never had.",1525132808

&gt; I just don't see why that would happen. What incentive is there? By providing an inefficient working wage, they have already demonstrated their selfishness/greed. So you are basically saying ""the rich will stop being so greedy if we give them more money.""

This is not what voodoonomics is about. It does not assume any benevolence on the part of the rich, but it assumes that the poor are fed by the wastefulness of the rich.

Imagine it like a medieval banquet where the feudal lord enjoys the finest game prepared by the best cooks in his realm. While he's eating the meat from the bones, he throws the bones he's done with on the floor and the dogs will run to scramble for the remaining meat on the bones. Now when the dogs (or the peasants) go hungry, voodoonomics says that instead of giving the dogs more food, we should hold more and more lavish banquets so that the bones that are thrown on the floor contain more meat. Of course the other possibility is that the lord becomes more greedy and gluttonous.

Or in a more modern day example: if we want to fight poverty, instead of giving money to the poor, we should give more money to the rich. That way they can buy more over-the-top, luxurious yachts that they'll visit only a few days every year. That way jobs are created for people that build and sell the yachts, people that perform maintenance on or clean the yachts, construction workers that build the ports and the docks. Etc., etc., etc.

And actually, for very few places around the world, this has actually worked out (e.g. Saint Tropez).",1525132809

With Jade temporarily out of the way, we will sprint to Dr. Feelgood to and we will hand Only A Lad to him. We did it, we saved the day, booyah. Well actually, we forgot one small thing. Now you may be wondering: ""They've already completed the objective, what the fuck are these nutjobs doing?"" Well dear reader, we at Bikini Bottom have taken it upon ourselves to make a secondary objective: ""Capture the enlightened master, Tsao Xu"" as a man that old would make an excellent test subject or just give us some sagely advice.

If Tsao had made it up the stairs and is with Jules, then we’ll start to make our back downstairs to run into them again. We’ll rush past them going the opposite direction, with Brain-Bolo (hopefully still attached to Tsao’s wheelchair) reaching out its tentacle arm so that MEKA-MANNY can grab a hold onto it. If MEKA-MANNY is still holding Doorfibrillator at this time, it will throw it at Jules or [Mirror Ball] (or in any direction that won’t harm their patient). MEKA-MANNY will reel in Brain-Bolo and start carrying Tsao in one hand, and Manny in the other. MEKA-MANNY will then rush into a nearby room with a window and jump out back first, still carrying Tsao and Manny. Lung-Glider will then pop out and we will all drift away into the sunset.

If Tsao was left on the bottom floor however, we will sprint straight there, hopefully avoiding Jules on the way back down. Once we reach the bottom floor, Manny will fuse the unused Brain-Bolo into what’s left of Stretchmobile to roughly repair and have it start following them. When they reach Tsao, Stretchmobile will use any non-spiky tentacles to gently grab and move Tsao onto it as they sprint back out of the hospital.

In either of these situations though, one more thing will be done right before they leave. MAKS will use [Evolution] on Jules, either when passing by him or through shooting it from a security camera. MAKS will then whisper to Jules through his stand: “Is this loss?”

&amp;nbsp;

#Manny’s Magic Menu:

* MEKA-MANNY: An exoskeleton made with pretty much anything you would find in an ambulance. Part of a liver from Manny’s cooler is used to make it living. The exoskeleton can open up and hold either Manny or MAKS in it. There are electronics fused into it so MAKS can control it. A stretcher is fused into the back of it so we can carry our patient or other things. The hands of this creation are roughly designed to be decent at scaling a wall. There will also be various eyes around it so that it has pseudo-360 degree vision.
* Lung-Glider: A parachute-like fusion made with a cut-open lung from Manny’s cooler and some spare blankets from one of the ambulances
* Stretchmobile: An ambulance engine fused with a rolly stretcher, some computer stuff from the ambulance, random wires Manny finds in the ambulance, any sharp objects lying around, and some small intestines from his cooler. Intestines and wires are fused in a way that they act like spiked tentacles. MAKS is able to remote control this fusion as computers are hooked up to the engine and the wires in the tentacles.
* Nurse Biohazard: A harvested nurse fused with spare bed sheets and used needles from a hospital room to become a viral hedgehog meatshield.
* Doorfibrillator: A door to a hospital room fused with many defibrillators taken from the ambulances where Manny and MAKS start. MEKA-MANNY wields this as an electrified shield.
* Acid-Lung: A last resort acid bomb made from the stomach and lung from the above harvested nurse. The idea is that the gases from the stomach acid will rise up into the lung and inflate it, so that when it pops, stomach acid will go flying everywhere.
* Brain-Bolo: A simple tentacle creature made with a brain and eye from Manny’s cooler and the intestines from the nurse. Used to stop Tsao’s wheelchair from moving and for possible repair jobs on the Stretchmobile.

#Contingencies:

* During initial phases, Manny will try to cover his face as much as possible so that [HM&amp;RR] doesn’t throw shit in his eyes.
* [HM&amp;RR] will most likely be throwing anything Manny tries to use in a fusion all around the place. If this gets to hectic, [Weird Science] will be briefly summoned or any existing creations will fetch the flying stuff.
* Most of Manny’s creations will have enough mass that if [HM&amp;RR] wants to push us all over the place, it’ll have to be constantly pushing us, so this probably won’t be very effective.
* [Mirror Ball] is able to release a force shockwave, but it seems like that would damage everybody around them so hopefully he won’t do that.
* If it seems like [Mirror Ball] will be too much for Manny’s creations, Manny will leave them behind and make a run for the feelin’ good doctor. [Weird Science] will tear the straps off of the stretcher and carry Only A Lad, following Manny to the doctor.

As far as validation is concerned, I wouldn't limit yourself to just looking at other bloggers \(it's actually ideal if you're the only blogger in a niche that's vastly popular elsewhere.\)

I'm brought back to shows like Brat Camp which play into this idea a lot. I also know there's a lot of books on using the outdoors to cope with these things. I would, honestly, look to Amazon for validation if you can't find blogs in this niche.

When/if you find books in your topic, get a good look at the reviews \- figure out what they say is missing. Look for phrases like ""but I wish"" or ""I would have loved if"".

As far as I'm concerned, that's free advice on exactly what people may want you to write about.

Small niche blogs are definitely a little harder to validate \- but even if you don't have the convenience of getting to look up your niche on Pinterest, it's still possible that your topic is popular in ANOTHER medium. That would mean the audience exists, but now you have to draw them in.

"gatech","t5_2r8t2","Ahh ok, you won't find many LMC on this subreddit unfortunately. My threads are People (CS thread) and Interactive Design &amp; Experimental Media (LMC thread). I will say that even as an LMC major you'll probably end up doing some coding. Other than that, I really like our LMC options because most classes are project-based, so we can create things and actually put theories into practice. The actual class focus varies heavily with the teacher, but you'll still gain a wide skillset as long as you stretch yourself to make something new and learn different technologies every time. You get what you put in with LMC at Tech. My favorite classes are actually for CM students (LMC 2700 and CS 2261), but I did love 2720 which teaches you foundation principles for design, and anything cross-listed with Industrial Design is fun (hands-on). I also recommend taking Special Topics courses. They're usually announced during registration, and they typically explore something unique (this semester I took an LMC one for Augmented and Virtual Reality). There's also a lot happening independently of classes - clubs like User Experience design, projects run by professors during the semester/summer, and useful labs like DILAC (specializes in VR) and the Invention Studio where you can pursue your personal projects and sharpen skills. Definitely read what's posted on the walls and pay attention to what people are doing, look for opportunities to do cool stuff. Personally I came trying to find where the technical and creative meet, so the theory part of many of my classes has been just as useful as the projects. Even though I'm prettyyyy stressed at times, I've really enjoyed learning what avenues are being explored and seeing all the areas I could pursue. Basically I hope to see where I most want to apply myself. In high school I had no idea what I wanted to be, so applying myself here has helped me figure that out a bit.
Last couple things, if you like writing at all (you don't need experience or ""talent""), take Poetry and Poetics or Creative Writing. Best experience in college. Also, the High Museum has a design in the digital age exhibit right now, and I consider it a CM/LMC dream come true, so check it out if you can. I think it ends some time this month.

10,000 years ago, the only human species left on Earth was our own, meaning that the baby in question would be an Anatomically modern human, so they would be physically and mentally our equal.

Evidence shows that humans from all around the world had long been producing artwork depicting abstract ideas, such as the Lion-man, a mix between a lion and a man:



Sites such as Europe's Chauvet Cave and Australia's Bradshaw rock paintings bear ages greater than 10,000 years, and consistently depict artwork whose production would require some sort of spiritual, imaginative or abstract thinking:



So I'd wager than this person (lets assume he's male and call him Bob, to avoid too many ""him/hers"" and ""Baby Xs"") would be able to do abstract mathematics and get a PHD in Biology.

Being the same species as us, Bob would have a growth rate not terribly different from our own. Having similar mental capabilities here, I'm sure he'd be able to communicate and socialize with other humans and build relationships, and have healthy offspring.

I should think that Bob wouldn't look too physically different from his/her contemporaries, nor would his peers think of Bob as an outsider, provided they didn't know that he was an anachronistic Pleistocene baby

"SuggestALaptop","t5_2s4k5","I would recommend this [Lenovo Yoga 720] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072M22XK8/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 7th generation, i7 quad core CPU which is one of the best in the market and great for your usage, 16GB of ram for smooth multitasking, good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading, 15.6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen which is a must have for this price range, high build quality, backlit keyboard, supports pen, thunderbolt port, and it’s within your budget.
 I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review, so here it goes:
 
* It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-7700HQ which is commonly used in gaming laptops, most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming.
 
* Full HD (IPS) 15.6 4K Touchscreen, which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage.
 
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops.
It will run most Games with variant settings depending on the game requirements with good FPS
* Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures, but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components
 	   	                    	           
* Good upgrades available, can go to 32 GB of ram, and even change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles.
 
* It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3.	 	                    	           
 
* Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage.
* Minimal bloat-ware, speakers have excellent quality but not so loud, Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards, Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver, It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate, The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

So what you do is copy and paste a paragraph and use overtype to reword it as you go along so it isn't plagiarised.

Peak uses 4G LTE and mounts an antenna on top of your residence for service.

"marriedredpill","t5_32dvh","I read that whole thing. I'm trying to imagine a good reason that you would stay married to your wife. All I can come up with is that she's now working, about to get a promotion, and that will reduce your alimony if you lock in her new income numbers.

If you're going to stick around a few more years anyway, get her working now. No kids who spend all day at school need a SAHM, especially one who sleeps more than an egyptian mummy.

Also, you said a dumb thing in there about the decision to SAHM, which was that if she was working she would just been handing the money over to day care / preschool. First, that kind of care gets cheaper as the kid gets older. Second, when your wife stops working, it gets harder and harder to re-enter a career at a place where you left off. My wife basically took three years of part-time work / shit jobs to work back to the money and prestige she had when she quit working. She was also a shitty SAHM. I hope your wife at least cooks and cleans. The first crappy jobs my wife had, yeah, we were breaking even or the money was even going backwards. It was totally worth it to have current industry contacts and for her to network her way into a better job. It never would have happened for her to have gone straight from SAHM to the unsolicited job offer she received where she now makes almost as much as me.  Step one, any job she can get. Step two, network into better job. Repeat as needed.

Congratulations on the DL11. One of the few things I see you did right when faced with that woman. My MIL isn't as big of a cunt as yours, but my MIL was the common denominator in three divorces. My wife made noises about moving MIL into our place, and I told her if MIL moves in, she'll be part of a fourth divorce.

'Skyrim is windy' and 'Blowing in the wind' really adds to immersion

'torches cast shadows' is fantastic

'Darker nights' because really dark nights are awesome, espeically in VR

[dungeon darkness](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7535) is also great for the same reasons.

Also - there are some sound mods which are vital imo, specifically [3D audio](https://github.com/kosumosu/x3daudio1_7_hrtf/releases) (make sure you grab the skyrimVR patch), and then layering lucidity (for improved base vanilla audio), audio overhaul (overhauls vanilla audio further, adding location-based reverb and effects) and finally immersive sounds compendium for expanding the soundscape.

**QOL/immersion/roleplaying:**
Immersive vr quickslot tool is a must, I found the [latest beta build](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/8fv1m5/immersive_vr_quickslots_020_pre2_testers_release/) to work without issues.

SkyTEST realistic animals and predators is insane for immersion imo, absolutely necessary.

Bandolier bags and pouches has made inventory management a lot more manageable for me while also adding to immersion and feeling balanced, very much recommended.

Skyrim unbound - seems to work better than live another life, allows you to skip the intro and start in various places around the world with customizable starting gear and spells etc. Let's you get around every character having the same initial story and you can get around ever doing any part of the main quest (though you can start it any time you want after you have unlocked your first shout).

'Even better quest objectives' is a great way to rely less on quest markers.

'Footprints' adds a really cool missing detail

'Cloaks of skyrim' is awesome as well

OBIS - organized bandits in skyrim, and 'immersive patrols' adds some more stuff to encounter along the roads.

'Royal armory' and 'zim's immersive artifacts' make the cool treasure actually be cool.

'Hold border banners' is another great detail mod

'Immersive citizens', since the previous patch I've had no issues with it, adds some cool immersive behaviours.

And then there's the whole [immersive navigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/8cbldz/immersive_navigation_never_use_that_world_map/) 'package' if you like that sort of thing.

**Mage stuff:**

Of course you really should grab apocalypse, and I'd argue ordinator as well (with the VR perk fix). Adds so many cool builds, effects and spells for magic users. (And I'm using andromeda as well for even more potential builds). These also add effects like ocato's recital that make managing your buffs and triggering effects a lot easier and more fun.

The quickslot tool helps with managing all your spells but you could try some voice control as well, through Way of the voice or Dragonborn speaks naturally. 

I'm also using 'better wards' to make them a little stronger and stagger agaisnt melee attacks, because I like using wards and it makes them less useless.

**Difficulty/combat**

I'm using smilodon, mortal enemies and realistic melee range to make enemies more aggresive, easier to actually dodge and add some challenge. Smilodon also has an option to increase both your and your enemies damage output a great deal to create a difficult but non-bulletspongy combat with quick brutal fights (Personally though I feel like things die pretty quickly anyway so I don't use it).

I also use 'no BS AI projectile dodge', because it removes a major annoyance from longer range combat.",1525132821

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt; Barriers to entry nullify comparative advantage. If someone's maximum productivity is less than minimum wage, they are unemployable. If the cost of logistics is greater than the difference in advantages, trade is at a loss. Some people cannot be retrained.

Barriers to entry do not nullify comparative advantage.  They might make it an unpersuasive argument to the individual in your hypothetical but that doesn't make it nullified given all the other considerations or the worse argument when it comes to what policies to pursue.  

&gt;For an uneducated, 45-year-old factory worker in Missouri, or an unfortunate urban youth with an IQ of 80, the factory closing down could be the end of all possible opportunities for them.

That's simply false, even in a hypothetical in which we can tweak all variables without constraint.  People are not obligated to remain where they are, sure that factory might be the most immediate opportunity but relocating to find better economic opportunities is a story as old as written history.  Minimum wage is [relatively](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE) low in the US compared to the [rest](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RMW) of the OECD countries, there will be employment at that level available in any area with economic prospects.  That economic opportunity is always present in every corner of a country has always been false.  This suggestion that public policy can create specific types of viable economic enterprise in any area regardless of the state of the variables that largely dictate economic success or opportunity is utterly hollow and has been the siren song of lying politicians and false populism for a very long time.  

&gt;Sure, things get cheaper, the economy improves, but a small section of the population's lives are consigned to welfare or disability.

That it doesn't have a comparative advantage doesn't mean it isn't viable, just that it's less efficient generally.  It doesn't mean every factory should close, but some probably will and that's not the hill anyone should be dying on.",1525132822

Society isn’t kind to women who don’t act like motherhood is 100% magical and fulfilling all he time and that it’s the best decision they ever made.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Korea has long history with steppe nomads and its northern regions \(Manchuria\), and various Korean kingdoms had to deal with invasions, wars, and border conflicts all the same as China. Often when we hear of Korea's ancient and medieval history we think of it as very peaceful, but the northern frontier regions \(using the modern borders of Korean peninsula\) was anything but. Realistically, this is going to be more a explanation on the history of the Manchurian region than on the nomads alone as from the Korean perspective, the nomads and China were somewhat interchangeable.

First, the Manchurian region was a hotly contested one between Korea, China, and steppe nomads. The modern delineation between China and the Korean peninsula uses the Duman \(Tumen\) and Amnok \(Yalu\) rivers as its natural borders but this was something Korea had to fight and win over gradually against both China and the nomads.

It's difficult to figure where exactly to start since precluding the ancient ancient history would mean a lot of interesting conflicts are missed, but I guess to best summarize we can go with Manchuria was occupied by the successive Korean kingdoms: Gojoseon \-\&gt; Wiman Joseon \(a Sino\-Korean mix\) \-\&gt; Han commanderies \(China\) \-\&gt; Buyeo \-\&gt; Goguryeo \-\&gt; Balhae \(Korean\-Jurcheon/steppe nomads mix I believe\). Keep in mind there are a lot of caveats that are missed here; what we say as Korea or China in the modern sense is not something that exists. It is retroactively applied to make things easier to understand but the truth is there is a lot of intermingling between Chinese, Koreans, and the nomads. However, East Asian historiography still has major problems with nationalism which does make it difficult to objectively understand this period. I can explain more if you'd like to know more, but I'd like to just get into the main points.

The northern Korean kingdoms in Manchuria \(the last one being Balhae\) eventually collapsed from nomadic invasions by the Khitan in the 10th century as unrest spread all over East Asia. Chinese Tang dynasty collapsed, the southern Silla kingdom in Korea collapsed as well which led to the rise of a unified Korean dynasty, Goryeo. Khitans claimed themselves as the Great Liao dynasty and occupied Manchuria and northern China while eventually the Song dynasty claimed the mandate of heaven in China as well. In this period, the interaction between Korea and China was greatly weakened because the Khitans to the north began invading Goryeo Korea because Goryeo were sending their envoys to the Song as recognition of their claim to the mandate instead of sending their envoys to the Khitan. Goryeo was also itching for war in some respects because one of the dynasty's goals was to recover Manchuria from the ""barbarians"" that were occupying ""Korean"" lands.

The following Goryeo\-Khitan war was eventually settled in the early 11th century. Goryeo began to send their envoys to the Khitan after as well, in a dual recognition of both Song and Liao, while the Khitan ceded territories south of the Amnok river, a change in territory that continues to persist to today.

However, the Khitan Liao collapsed to the Mongol Yuan dynasty in the 13th century and Goryeo also capitulated as well. This is probably the more well\-known part of interaction between the nomadic empires to the north of Korea and Korea itself since Mongols famously conquered, well, everything but Japan and Vietnam.

Under the Yuan dynasty, Goryeo royalty were often sent to China as hostages and were forced to intermarry with the Yuan Mongols. Eventually as the Yuan weakened Goryeo under King Gongmin implemented anti\-Mongol policies and removed pro\-Mongol officials and reclaimed their independence. The Yuan dynasty itself collapsed to the Ming dynasty after the Red Turban rebellion. This rebellion spilled into Korea itself as the rebels in Liaodong peninsula were looking for supplies, which Goryeo managed to beat back. Additionally, in this moment of weakness in China, the Goryeo court authorized an invasion of Manchuria as a part of a campaign to recover lost Korean territories in the north. However, the general chosen to lead to attack went up until the river border between Manchuria and Korea and decided to turn back and rebel against Goryeo. The newly established Joseon dynasty succeeding Goryeo was heavily pro\-Ming.

During Joseon period, Korea was in constant conflict against the Jurcheon tribes \(that were nominal vassals to the Ming\) that were occupying Manchuria. Gradually, the Joseon kingdom expanded to the Duman river, establishing the modern Korean peninsula borders we know today.

In the 17th century however, the Jurcheon tribes were united under a powerful warlord named Nurhaci and the Ming was invaded and overthrown eventually by Nurhaci's son who established the Qing dynasty. Qing invaded and capitulated Korea and forced them to enter a tributary relation. And the story sort of just ends here. After the Jurcheons \(also called Manchu\) conquered China and forced Korea into a tributary relationship, Korea entered a long period of peace until the West came knocking because its sole land border was shared with the Chinese Empire and the Qing recognized the two rivers as the natural border between China and Korea.

I guess you can argue that if I truly have a community of respect, students won't treat each other/the classroom that way, but sometimes kids are having a shitty day and express it the wrong way. 
 
That being said, I think that some teachers are way too quick to write referrals, and generally, those are teachers that don't have a strong relationship with their kids. Last year I had a terrible relationship with a few of my kids, and I totally admit that I wrote up referrals for things I totally should've handled myself, but I was so done with them and their behavior that I wanted them out.

A really coarse stone with another side for finishing on would be this - useful for fixing chipped blades and overall getting a very sharp edge.  It's diamond so it does not need maintained.

A good at home stone in your price range would be this one, you have to soak it in water for 5-20min before using (each time, until it stops bubbling in the water) but it's a great stone that is widely used: KING KW65 1000/6000 Grit Combination Whetstone with Plastic Base https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DT1X9O/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_n565AbSFCV7EG

Anything 'bearmoo' or 'sharp pebble' or anything looking like those ones honestly is not going to be enjoyable or comparable in quality to the above.

Then came her own tears as she unstrapped her wristband/bracelets that all had some leather and asked me if I could take her somewhere that had non-leather shoes at my next convenience. 

Prior to this she had been super accommodating about where we met for meals and even asked her flatmates to modify their main meals a bit when I was hanging out so it was all vegan. 

This key difference in our outlook at the beginning of the relationship showed me how my future wife would handle potential points of conflict and she is an absolute gem, we adore each other and are super respectful of each other's pursuits, we've been married a decade now and she phased from Omni to vegan in the few weeks after seeing Earthlings.

I myself am a convert and one of the things that I loved most and helped me to get immersed in Islam is fasting during Ramadan.  Also this is a great time to go to the mosque because 1) lots of bigger mosques usually have free dinner for the daily breaking of the fast and 2) there are lots of people at the mosques during Ramadan. Also you should feel free to stay after the daily night prayer during Ramadan for the tarawih prayers, which is usually about 1 to 1.5 hours long.

So say you’re in a bar fight and some guy has a knife and maybe there’s even another guest that you didn’t know and he thinks you’re a host and he’s gonna stab you in the back. In that instance, a good Samaritan host would seamlessly intersect and get in that fight and literally take that knife for you. Now accidents can happen – falling off a cliff and things like that.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","It’s cool to have the goal of dating be marriage...but its probably not a good plan to just randomly marry the first girl that cooperates.  

If a person doesn’t have options, they’ll settle for less than they deserve because lack of options breeds desperation.  

You need to create options for yourself.  Do you have male friends?  Do you go out often?(not to bars...do you have hobbies? Rock climbing, ultimate frisbee, board games, etc?). If you’re not meeting men and women, you need to get out more...take up new hobbies.  Join a meet up group for hiking or something.  

If you meet a lot of women but find that none of them want to date you or be your friend...then you might need to spend some time working on yourself.  Become the best version of yourself.  Start working out (if you don’t already), get a different haircut, practise talking to more people (maybe you’re socially awkward?)....make yourself more desirable to women.  

What I’m trying to say is...have fun.  Do things that interest you, and you’ll be interesting to others.  Work on becoming a great friend, and a good listener....because a key component to any marriage is friendship.  My husband is my best friend.  Dress in flattering clothing...if you don’t know if you’re looking good, go to the mall and get help with buying fashionable clothes.  

Envision your perfect wife...think of all of the traits she would have.  Then think about the kind of man she would want to marry.  The kind of man she’d respect and admire...and become that man.  

I did that to meet and marry my husband....but I had to (authentically) become the type of person he would want to be with (I hadn’t met him yet...I liked his type though). 

Anyway, it’s not as complicated as it sounds...but self improvement, or changing your habits (to meet more people) is challenging.  But it’s worth it :)",1525132828

Regarding your expectations: have none. Try not to expect too much, because you likely won't get anything near what you were expecting. Its impossible to fathom until you experience it.

Regarding your setting. With 4 very close friends that's pretty good, but I wouldnt expect to be able to just chill like you normally would. You can't just chill on acid. It takes priority over whatever you're doing. It becomes the moment. Your head will be going all different directions. Its a whole event itself. Its not like weed, where you can just chill on it and do whatever. You will be on acid, and that will be the main focus no matter what, so try not to fight that. That said, you can still have fun with your friends, just dont expect to be all there. Acid expands your awareness greatly, but at the same time leaves you profoundly disoriented. Make sure your friends know this, and are down to make whatever accommodations to suit your needs, and even wants. Also, I wouldn't swim on acid your first time.

"truetrannies","t5_4boen","I agree with a lot of what you're saying. 

I am not necessarily against teenagers transitioning but there needs to be heavier gate keeping and a better understanding of gender dysphoria. It should not be stereotypes but bodily dysphoria and a need to have primary and secondary sexual characteristics of the opposite sex that should be the criteria. The problem is that the trans movement has removed a lot of the original gatekeeping and made it into a money making machine that preys on gnc kids rather than helping transsexual teenagers. 

Here are my personal beliefs: 

-No transitioning for kids: Kids should not be encouraged or told they are trans. Not even social transition. If a little boy is feminine and wants to dress up in dresses and play with dolls (likewise for the opposite) then that's fine, kids should be able to express themselves and pursue their natural interests. But telling them that makes them a girl or boy is damaging in my opinion. I'm personally even against social transition for kids because like you said kids don't really know what they want and cannot often grasp complex concepts like adults can. Kids are easy to brainwash too. Telling them they really want to be the opposite sex can open the door for abusive parents to take advantage of children.

-Puberty blockers should be given at a minimum of 13 or 14 years old. I have seen ridiculous ages such as 10 or 11 but when you give some blockers before they ever go through puberty they are not going to sexually develop and therefore not produce sperm or eggs correctly. Sterilizing a patient who cannot fully consent due to lack of cognitive development should be considered malpractice. Giving puberty blockers too early will also not allow the child to go through some of their natal puberty which is the best way to tell if someone is suffering from dysphoria or not in my opinion. 

-hormones should be given at a minimum of 16 years.

"virtualbeggar","t5_3kdlt","Allright... went ahead and gathered the data of all towns/cities, depending on how many bus passengers you have and what speed upgrade you have. This data is for the current (3.22) update.

Let's go with the VCs first:

Penny Village: 1&amp;2 Bus Passengers (BPs) = 0|1|4, 3 BPs = 0|1|5, 4 BPs = 0|2|6, 5 BPs = 0|2|8.

Nickeltown: 1 BPs = 0|2|7, 2 BPs = 0|2|8, 3 BPs = 0|2|9, 4 BPs = 0|3|11, 5 BPs = 0|4|14.

Dimeville: 1 BPs = 1|5|25, 2 BPs = 1|6|28, 3 BPs = 1|6|31, 4 BPs = 2|8|40, 5 BPs = 2|10|50.

Dollar City: 1 BPs = 2|8|15, 2 BPs = 2|9|16, 3 BPs = 2|10|19, 4 BPs = 3|13|24, 5 BPs = 4|16|30.

Creditpolis: 1 BPs = 3|10|100, 2 BPs = 3|11|110, 3 BPs = 4|12|125, 4 BPs = 5|16|160, 5 BPs = 6|20|200.

Note that I haven't ever had the luck to grab 3rd value prizes from 3rd, 4th and 5th location (I'm sure about it when it comes to Creditpolis and a little unsure when it comes to 4th and 3rd locations, but I'd risk I only had 2nd prize there max).

Now, onto the speeds:

Penny Village: 1h | 50m | 40m | 33m20s | 27m16s | 23m4s | 16m12s | 10m

Nickeltown: 4h | 3h20m | 2h40m | 2h13m | 1h49m | 1h32m | 1h4m | 40m

Dimeville: 10h25m | 8h40m | 6h56m | 5h47m | 4h44m | 4h | 2h48 | 1h44m

Dollar City: 1d4h | 23h36m | 18h53m | 15h44m | 12h52m | 10h53m | 7h39m | 4h43m

Creditpolis: 2d7h | 1d21h | 1d12h | 1d6h | 1d1h | 21h9m | 14h51m | 9h10

As for the bus speed upgrades, it's more than sensible to buy the penultimate (for the 250M) or the one before it (40M) right away. Only the last one (1.9B) is kind-of pricey, but this nullifies of course the farther into the game we are.

And oh, the levels of availability (+descriptions that fit mostly the max speed upgrade):

Penny Village: right away (lvl 25). Easily the best one for the regular play and getting most VCs (illogical, but true).

Nickeltown: lvl 31. Good if you're away for a precise amount of time and you know it in advance.

Dimeville: lvl 39. Same as with Nickeltown.

Dollar City: lvl 48. Best for the night course in most cases (unless we sleep/are out of the game for more than 9h)

Creditpolis: lvl 70. Not worth the wait given what it brings, IMO.

So if you want to know my say.. while max speed upgrade is obvious to do (for VC squeezing), the last passenger is... kind of controversial. Unless it changes something 'below' what we see (for example, the percentage of getting the 2nd/3rd prize), it doesn't seem that big of a difference. Let's consider the most important locations, that is 1st and 4th (and maybe 5th). Penny Village has 2 VCs more, but only on the 3rd prize, which isn't common. Not really rare, but definitely not common. So not really a big difference here. Going to Dollar City, the situation is slightly better as the guaranteed VC value is upped by one (same goes with Creditpolis), but it's only 1 (and one spends 1200 on the last passenger). The 2nd values are only slightly better, and I'd risk these, in terms of rarity, are about on par with 3rd value of the Penny Village (but probably only due to how short it takes to get there). Playing long enough, I'd say I'd give it a try, but then again I'm kind of completionist (read: I'll consider this game finished when I have 999 UDs and probably even then there'll be some things to do left ; ) so I'm not sure if to listen to me ; ) At least you've got all the hard data so you can think about it : P",1525132830

You don't need to attempt to crush anything, it's not a very good idea.  Personally I find discussing religion with Christians IRL to be profoundly uncomfortable.

&gt;Also, how do Christians completely disregard the contradictions borne from Judaism?

They have answers for things.  They're not convincing to us, of course, but we're not the target audience.  In some ways it's easier because they've often defined themselves as being diametrically opposed to Judaism.  Which sort of adds its own issues (because they also claim Jewish religious heritage), but it sets them up to reject whatever we'd say anyway.",1525132831

Burn our troubles

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Yes, but only under extremely rare circumstances given our current technology. One example is [PSO J318.5-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSO_J318.5-22), another example is [2MASS J1119-1137](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2MASS_J1119%E2%80%931137). 

Both of these objects are large planets, about 5 - 10 Jupiter-masses. They're also both very close, only about 80 light-years away. Finally, they're also both very young - about 10 million years, some 400x younger than our Solar System. 

Most important for detection, they're both still hot from their original formation; in fact, we can only detect them because they're warm enough to emit their own infrared light, similar to the way the coils in your toaster glow red-hot. As they age, they'll cool, emit less and less infrared light and eventually fade from view.

So, in order for us to see one of these rogue planets, they need to be emitting enough of their own infrared light. That means they need to be...

- Hot enough to emit a lot of infrared light

- Young enough to still be hot

- Large enough that they don't lose that heat too quickly

- Relatively close to see them in spite of their intrinsic faintness",1525132832

"panthers","t5_2s1w0","I mean they play different positions and will be used differently. I think maybe Funch will have more grabs and DJ will have more yards and TDs. 

I think Funch, Olsen and CMC are most likely to be our third-down go-to guys. DJ will get some 1st/2nd-down screens and he'll probably house a couple, and he'll break an ankle or two to get himself wide open downfield. 

He and Samuel might run some jet sweeps and end arounds. I mean the ideal situation is CMC is Brian Westbrook, Funch is like Moose/ Alshon Jeffery / Dez Bryant / Brandon Marshall, Samuel is like Tyreek Hill / Percy Harvin, and Moore is like Steve Smith / Antonio Brown. That's what the offensive coaches will be daydreaming about, and while it's unlikely everyone reaches that level, each of them has the potential to do so. If they all maximize their potential and we have anything resembling an O-Line and a healthy Cam we'll have a top 5 offense year-in year-out for several years.

I think people are overestimating Smith's likely role in the team. We traded a guy we were gonna cut for a guy they were gonna cut. He's very much fighting for a spot on the 53 with Wright, Byrd &amp; Shepard. He could show signs of the old Torrey Smith and make himself a lock, or he could show signs of continued decline and become a bubble guy.

I think it's very possible Shep makes the 53 as a special teams ace since there are enough receivers ahead of him that his value on special teams is higher than a #6 receiver (so really a #8 passing target because of Greg/CMC) who doesn't strengthen our ST as much. Special teams are important

Smith is 29, Wright is 28, Byrd is 25. Byrd and Smith would be likely to play the same role in the offense, so I think there's a chance Wright makes the team as basically Funch's backup and it comes down to whether Smith is enough better than Byrd to make up for the age difference

Chemistry with Cam will play a huge role in who gets targets, too. We know he has good chemistry with Funchess, Olsen &amp; CMC, so to break into that tier of targets, Cam will have to trust the player. I expect Cam will love DJ Moore and they'll click immediately. He was also developing great chemistry with Byrd before Byrd's injury. He and Shep didn't really click (which would matter way less if Shep is the #6 receiver instead of, at times last year, the #2). We don't know yet how well Samuel, Smith &amp; Wright will click with Cam, and I guess Thomas is part of that group as well. So that's a factor as well",1525132832

They're supposed to look at the case before them and decide based on the arguments. What Trump might have said or done on Twitter or elsewhere doesn't affect the powers he has as president, and SCOTUS is only here to interpret those powers. They shouldn't rule against Trump because he seems odd or morally wrong but because what he's doing is illegal.

As for the press, it's complicated. It seems Reddit likes to assume that everyone shares their point of view on Trump, but that's not the case in reality. Still about 35-40% of Americans support him, a very significant number. The media, which is driven by views and profits, has to appeal to at least some of them if they want to compete. They can't just trash Trump 24/7 or else they'll lose a large chunk of the population.  Plus, I don't think I want the media to become a source of judgement. It shouldn't be up to the press to decide whether Trump is a racist or an idiot. They should just present the facts and then let us decide. I do have my issues with the press, such as their constant obsession with profit, but I don't expect them to just universally disdain Trump at every turn. The world isn't that black and white.",1525132834

After my ablation I just did walking and some badminton as exercise, I wasn’t a gym goer then.

"panthers","t5_2s1w0","Dude, we thought you died! In all seriousness I think you have Moore and Thomas too low in their respective depth positions. I’d expect to see Moore around the WR3 position going into the preseason trying to become our WR1 during the season. Thomas as well depending on if he shows ability like what the team and analysts are predicting I expect to see jumping Manhurtz on the depth chart.

Aside from that I have my eye on Moton. I’m hoping we didn’t bring Sirles or Silatolu in to be our starter at left guard. And even though I’ve been skeptical on Moton as guard, I know the team was giving him looks there (I think 16 of his 67 snaps last season). The undrafted guys aren’t going to immediately be on the depth chart (aside from possibly Kyle Bosch who I think has the best potential of the guys we’ve gotten so far), but I could see one them taking a spot there by the end of the year. 

I’m also interested by you having Heinicke as our only backup. Do you really see him as that much more of a talent than Kyle Allen? Heinicke hasn’t played a single regular season snap and has been on practice squads or IR since 2016. ",1525132837
"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","The problem I see with this explanation is that Thanos didn't do anything whatsoever to ensure that the newly wiped populations would care about population control.

He didn't give any speeches, offer dire ultimatums, or explain his actions.  He didn't wait until civilizations were in a population crisis and developed policies/technologies of their own.

Take Earth as an example.  Its close enough to our earth that we can assume it had a looming population *problem*, but not a crisis.  There were no single-child policies in place, no global famines mentioned.  And then suddenly a cataclysmic event occurs that halves the population.  Do you really think the instinct would be to suddenly implement population controls?  I think it would be quite the opposite - people would be encouraged to fuck like rabbits.

Not to mention any warlike or prideful civilizations would almost certainly care more about restoring themselves above all else, if for no other reason than to retaliate.

IMO this implies that Thanos either *seriously* did not think things through, or that his long-term plan involves a whole lot more than sitting in a cabin watching the sunset.  For his idea to ultimately work long-term, *he* has to be the one that ensures populations don't rise again.",1525132837

Let's be honest, that rock is staying Korea's. But both countries use it for propaganda purposes to stir up nationalist feelings. 


&gt;That having been said, though, the presence of a massively out-of-scale Dokdo on that flag/dessert is so silly that it boggles the mind that you can look at this event and see Japan as the country that is immature.


The reason for that is preciously because of Japan's claim... I bet if Japan didn't go nuts with its claims, the  dot would not be there. Heck, maybe the Koreans but the dot there just to get Japan to react, and look like idiots ahead of the summit.

&gt;Conditions for admissibility (2) In proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1), evidence shall not be adduced by or on behalf of the accused that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person, unless the judge, provincial court judge or justice determines, in accordance with the procedures set out in sections 278.‍93 and 278.‍94, that the evidence

&gt;(4) For the purpose of this section, sexual activity includes any communication made for a sexual purpose or whose content is of a sexual nature.

&gt;Form and content of application (2) An application referred to in subsection (1) must be made in writing, setting out detailed **particulars of the evidence that the accused seeks to adduce** and the relevance of that evidence to an issue at trial, and a copy of the application **must be given to the prosecutor** and to the clerk of the court.

Emphasis mine. Basically this means that any evidence you can muster up is handed over to the prosecutor long before the trial and combine that with the fact your accuser can amend their statement means you cannot prove them lying on the stand since they'll just change their story with any evidence you find. It essentially means you aren't allowed a defense and thus you aren't allowed a fair trial.",1525132837

Ya cause you guys thought you had the next Edward Snowden here, took out your big boy toys and went in with your whole team to take down a 19 year old who only pulled down web pages that the government was stupid enough to leave publicly accessible. No wonder you don't want to get into a public debate about it because you look like over zealous idiots who put a family at risk for no reason whatsoever.

Keep in mind the judge that approved what was likely a no knock warrant bears responsibility for this as well. A proper evaluation of the crime and suspect should have resulted in a couple officers in a marked car going to his house to pick him up. Or of course no arrest at all due to this prosecution being a complete waste of what we are constantly told are preciously scant police and judicial resources.

"firewater","t5_2rcpo","&gt; My condenser is able to knock down 100% of the vapour produced @3000W with headroom to spare so I haven't really bothered with decreasing the power. When/why should I use reduced power?

You are running way too hard for a 2"" column at 3kw. Without a controller, I would run at 1.5kw instead. A reflux column operates in what is called ""equilibrium"" which is a steady state of ascending vapor and descending liquid that produces proper fractions up the column. Running too fast (vapor speed) wrecks this. 3kw is definitely too hard for 2""x48"". You might be getting azeotrope, but you aren't getting good cuts, if at all. Everything is being smeared together by blasting vapor up the packing too hard.

Putting a controller on one of your elements will allow you to run anywhere from 0 to 3kw. [Here](https://homedistiller.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=13265) are some good instructions on running your LM stll.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","Sorry for the late reply. I think you are massively overlooking people who disagree with you. I went through a short ""anti-feminist"" phase a few years ago because a feminist called Anita Sarkeesian did a series on videogames being heavily sexist.

That series was very poorly researched and at the time I was *very* passionate about gaming. Seeing someone say those things felt like an attack to me, to my friends and to my community, which was especially rough since things were not going great at school socially and videogames were my only escape. After that series, a lot of people started harassing gamers defending themselves or people defending gamers on social media and I found it repulsive. After doing some research I found the worst of feminism and formed my opinion based on that, which of course wasn't rational or fair, but it definitely wasn't ""under-gired by an intense hatred of women"".

I have changed my mind since then, but I can still at least comprehend where anti-feminists are coming from. (1) is fair, but (2) is just a prejudice many people use to dismiss other people's opinion, and is intellectually dishonest.",1525132841

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","the biggest thing I notice silver players have no concept of is just the overall economy of the map.

At any given time throughout the entire game, there are minions in top, mid, bottom, and monsters in the jungle. On a really really good team in challenger, there's a good chance that someone will be rotating to clear each of these places and then returning to pressuring objectives. Everyone is always moving and farming.

On the other hand, silver players just don't see the problem with sending 5 players to midlane and laying siege to the tier 1 mid tower for 5 minutes straight. No need to go bot or top, the towers in that lane will clear out the minions for us. No need to farm the jungle, the monsters aren't going anywhere.

That's why... sure at 10 minutes you might have 70 CS. But at 30 minutes it's super rare to see people with above 200.

----------

As a plat player, I notice that most plat players have mechanics that are exactly the same or equal to silvers. They also usually have about the same CS as a silver player around 10 minutes. The real distance that separates the two ELOs are simply what people *do* during mid game and late game. I see good junglers clearing their jungle and then clearing the sidelane as well. Good supports and ADCs will recall after a successful gank from midlane, while the midlaner quickly clears the wave and then rotates back to mid. Toplaners will teleport bottom for fights and then immediately recall and get back to top without losing more than a handful of CS.",1525132842

"soccer","t5_2qi58","On Cedric, he’s defensively solid but seems to be completely unable to hit the target on a cross. One of our most consistent players and could likely make the step up to a bigger club and not look out of place but he’s hardly going to get in anyone’s team of the season.

Honestly could see us selling quite a few players even if we stay up. Boufal and Gabbiadini are surely out no matter what, neither of is playing for us (Boufal isn’t even training with the senior team anymore) and Gabbiadini was linked with a move back to Italy in January. 

We turned down significant offers for Cedric and Bertrand last summer, which looks like a pretty shit decision in hindsight but we’d placed all our chips in the not selling players basket which looks bad in hindsight, thanks in no small part to Virgil’s horrible attitude on the pitch for us. I could see both being off whether we’re up or down but surely if we’re down, would like to see them replaced by academy lads but I’m not sure we’ll have the stones to do that if we stay up.

If we’re down you can count Lemina off, Redmond needs a change of scenery and we need to move on from him, Hojbjerg could possibly force a move as well, he seems to have real passion for the club but he’ll put himself first at the end of the day. Carrillo is a possibility, Hughes doesn’t put him in the squad and he was very much a “backing Pellegrino” signing so he’ll have an uphill battle to ever win the fans over.

this is all just speculation and wishful thinking though, and it obviously depends quite a bit on the league we play in",1525132842

The report identified 63 incidents involving those “motivated by a  theocratic political ideology espoused by such groups as the Islamic  State”. In that time period, this includes the San Bernardino shootings  and Boston Marathon bombings, among others.Right\-wing extremists, often [white supremacists](http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/white-supremacist),  were responsible for 115 incidents within the same period. Events like  Robert Dear’s killing of three people at a Colorado Planned Parenthood  women's health clinic in December 2015 for offering abortion services  would fall into this category.In terms of police action, 76 per cent of the Islamist incidents were  thwarted versus just 35 per cent of the right\-wing extremist incidents.

When the Soviets pulled out, the DRA continued to use it's massive airpower advantage and rout the rebels on many occasions, scoring some of the war's deadliest losses on the Mujahideen, completely independent of Soviet military support. 

The Stinger myth is as ridiculous as the idea that the VC beat the US out of Vietnam.

More people are willing to journey on the path of spiritual enlightenment while still learning to navigate the illusion and play the game of life.

As all the tools are now provided to us to essentially become anyone we wish to be.

Eventually we as a society will harness the true potential of the internet as a place of higher Learning and spiritual enlightenment.

Think about the target audience and how much competition you have.

I'm at the point in my life I don't care so much about the price but of my precious time. Your marketing is terrible. Fighting with your target audience and laughing at them on Reddit is even worse.

But we, consumers are wary of most if not all games. So it's our fault you're not getting the immediate results you wanted? Honestly confused on your need to deflect and say the same pr responses of ""you're welcome to your opinion lol"".

"UFOs","t5_2qhds","From my understanding (which is pretty much the Wikipedia version) the Alcubierre drive is still highly speculative, requiring exotic types of matter not known to exist.  Even if it were possible in principal - and it's not overwhelmingly clear that it is - achieving and controlling the necessary energy densities (to make it useful for an interstellar vehicle) would itself require new physics and imaginary technology, which we have no concrete reason to believe is possible (which is not to say it's impossible, just no reason to believe one way or the other).

The reasoning that ""UFOs appear to be non-human intelligence, and non-human intelligence probably exists somewhere in the universe, therefore UFOs are probably intelligent beings from other planets"" is purely speculative, and circumstantial.  It's not actually evidence.  We have no explicit evidence that UFOs are vehicles built on another planet and flown here.

That's essentially the argument for the ET hypothesis as I understand it; ""it's probably right because we can't think of any other explanation."" That's not evidence, and throughout the history of science similar arguments have been disproven numerous times.

I take evidence to be synonymous with ""reason to believe."" We have no evidence that the ET hypothesis is true (no evidence that they're ships from other planets), or that any number of alternative explanations are false.  Therefore, in my opinion, we have no ""reason to believe.""

We need more information.  We're just now getting to the point that it's becoming accepted in the mainstream that ""this phenomenon exists and is interesting because it's not consistent with anything we understand.""",1525132847

"RedLetterMedia","t5_2tuot","I see problems with all these explanations. I agree with Lorioch. Based on the established rules and precedents of the MCU, there is literally nothing they can do. So they will have call upon a very mighty *deux ex machina* or break their own rules, like making the Infinity Stones not infinite, which seems like a huge copout. 

1. There is no basis for this belief. Why would Thanos send them to another dimension? And he did do that, why wouldn't he do it to the rest of them.
2. Dr Strange seeing Avengers 4 doesn't explain *how* Thanos loses. He doesn't lose because Dr. Strange saw him lose.
3. Captain Marvel, unless she has infinite power, can't do crap.
4. This isn't the comics. In the comics, his goal was never to kill half the universe, so he could still lose. In the movie, his goal was to kill half the universe. He won.
5. MCU Thanos isn't insane. He seems quite rational, stupid plan notwithstanding. And this version of Thanos is far more idealistic than the comic Thanos, so it is doubtful that he would jeopardize his success with ego. It could happen, but it would be out of character based on what we have seen.
6. Yeah...and he has the stones...and half the heroes are dead...and he can destroy anyone with a thought.
7. If the stones can be turned off or destroyed, they are hardly infinitely powerful. They might go with this, but it is a huge copout. As for being stolen \(or destroyed or turned off\), unless Thanos gives them an opening for this, it can't happen.

As for the other suggestion of time travel, Thanos has the only known artifact in the universe capable of time travel. Even if there was another way to time travel, he could just travel back to that time and defend himself.

I read this and some of the responses here and have to ask:

What to you is the norm? Is EVERYTHING a conspiracy?

For there to be a conspiracy then there would have to be a plan of some sort to deviate from and change the norm if you will, correct?

But what exactly is the *normal* that this conspiracy that you claim is deviating from?

Someone below wrote that QAnon is a White House psy-op. Okay, for the sake of argument let's say it is. Does that necessarily mean that automatically all psy-ops are bad? What if the US has deviated so far from the original constitution and it's intended to move us back in that direction?

Let's compare:

A psy-op that moves us towards socialism which inevitably ends in totalitarianism.

A psy-op that moves us away from socialism and back to self rule.

Hmmm...

But I think the core question here is what is normal? You're great at pointing out what you perceive as a conspiracy but if you can't identify what you would like to return to then you're like a reed blowing in the wind.

Or as a Gnostic are you just trying to escape? Then become enlightened and leave (if you can).

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Regarding whether it will happen, ""true AI"" and ""sentience"" are not necessarily related. Certainly actual sentience (the ability to feel subjectively) is probably a long way off because we can't clearly define what it is, seeing as it is dependent on a definition of consciousness (including subjective awareness), which nobody seems to agree on yet. However you can have life without consciousness, and I think Peter Watts did a great job at suggesting how you might have intelligence without consciousness in his book *Blindsight*. He floats the idea that consciousness is actually not only not necessary but that it's extremely inefficient and gets in the way of a lot of things. I'm not sure yet whether I agree, but it opens up the possibility that a non-sentient robot could be considered life or the equivalent thereof in a way, with the associated rights, if we reached a point where it had everything humans have *except* sentience, for example. 

The other neat thing about *Blindsight* is that it suggests a way you can have intelligence with a simpler neurological/biological system, so when we eventually achieve so-called ""strong AI"", my guess is that the final product will not completely model the human nervous system but rather take lots of shortcuts or even a different approach entirely, which is beside the point but interesting none the less.",1525132848

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","***Team Tactics:***

Due to Tsao’s physical form being vulnerable, Jules will act as the human shield if Tsao can’t use his thorns. Of course, anytime he acts like such, he will have to put the team’s guy down (because Jules is also carrying the team’s patient) and make sure the enemy doesn’t hit him either. Thanks to his decent offensive Stand stats and his Stand’s ability, Jules can hold out by himself for a while as both defense and offense, however, it is recommended for Tsao to be close enough to him, in order to get assistance whenever he needs. Otherwise, Jules will fall if left alone to be pressured by the enemy too much.


Tsao can be rather useful for surprise attacks when needed, especially when using himself or other objects as projectiles. He should not be too reckless, however, otherwise he can make Jules’ job harder.


So, to sum up the two points above, teamwork is heavily required, otherwise Tsao becomes an easy target and Jules’ frontline role becomes too hard for him. An example of good teamwork would be this: Jules gets attacked for a decent amount of time, enough to charge him up quite a bit, however he is worn out, so he needs to recover for a few seconds. During those few seconds, Tsao can use his ability to throw objects or himself at the enemy to distract them or keep them away for Jules, then Jules, once fully recovered, can deliver a powerful attack. 


Another strategy is this: Since Tsao has his wheelchair, he has some degree of defense, so, as long as Jules is careful with how much force he applies to Tsao’s wheelchair when he punches it, he can make Tsao faster. As for Jules, since Tsao’s abilities are also force-based and he can send objects flying towards any direction he wants, he can use his abilities to increase Jules’ speed. With this tactic, both can increase their speed as long as both are responsible with their partner’s durability and how much force should be applied to not inflict too much damage.


Summary of all: Jules and Tsao can increase their speed for an advantage as long as they’re responsible with their durability; Jules shouldn’t be left all by himself to take care of defending Tsao, the patient and himself (especially after Jules charges up enough, where, if he gets worn out from all the pressure and needs a few seconds to recover, Tsao should distract the enemy to protect Jules); Tsao should be protected at all costs if he can’t use his thorns, so a fast recovery (or forcing himself to protect Tsao) for Jules during moments when he gets tired from the pressure is recommended; Teamwork and good synchronization, like mentioned above, are required. As for obstacles, force-based abilities could presumably push people without harming them.


As for Yoko, Tsao could possibly hurl around objects to distract her if it’s really needed to kill (or just push out of the way with force) a patient or a doctor. Otherwise, however, around her, its recommended to not risk


***Countering the enemy:***


If Jaded Justice has to face the enemy, here are a few strategies they could use:


**MAKS**


Because MAKS’ recievers are very fragile, if it is not protected, Jules can easily knock it out temporarily (unless he only gets one reciever for this fight). Tsao can also hurl objects at it, that should also be enough. When MAKS is defenseless, it’s recommended for Jules or Tsao to finish off his reciever as soon as possible, before it can defend itself again. With one less teammate, the enemy team will be at a disadvantage.


MAKS’ stand attaches itself to targets. If it attaches itself to Tsao (NOT his wheelchair’s wheels), then its attachment effect becomes useless. If Evolution’s eye being covered hinders MAKS’ sight with it, then the recommended strategy in this situation is: Evolution attaches to Tsao’s body and Jules covers its eye. Because MAKS is no longer able to see through it, it isn’t able to know any longer where Jaded Justice is. If this forces MAKS to make his Stand leave, then Jaded Justice can leave the eye open, if they don’t think they’re in a location where MAKS could get important info from Evolution’s survellaince. If MAKS aims to tangle Tsao’s wheelchair wheels, Jaded Justice have to defend it or find a way to redirect Evolution’s veins towards another spot, so that Tsao doesn’t get stuck in place. Detaching Evolution would be tricky, especially if MAKS considers the placement an advantage.


Any electronics have to be turned off, placed in another room (even locked if possible) or outright destroyed around the area Jaded Justice are in, to give MAKS less electronics to use. This can also be used for offense if they decide to stall the enemy, so that MAKS wouldn’t be able to use specific electronics that can speed up its team.


Because damage transfer is null regarding Evolution, the focus should be delaying Evolution’s effects, using them to turn a possible advantage into an useless action, or getting rid of as many electronics around the area so that MAKS cant use them against Jaded Justice.







**Manny Elflad**


Manny is an even more dangerous opponent, because of his personal abilities. In terms of those, if Jules can steal his swiss-army knife and if he’s good enough at using it, he could use it to dissasemble electronics (in case that helps against MAKS or the electronics it can use). Otherwise, he can just simply get rid of it somehow to put Manny at a disadvantage. Manny being nearby Tsao is not recommended, if he can dissassemble the latter’s wheelchair. Due to his anatomy skills, defense against him is also highly important, both when he uses his knife and when he uses his Stand. If a Jaded Justice member dies, their corpse should, by all means, NOT be left in Manny’s presence for him to use as a minion.


Focusing on his Stand when MAKS isn’t too big of a threat is high priority. It’s recommended to throw away material he can use so that he is forced to expose his Stand. If his Stand is exposed, Jules and Tsao must immediately take him down. His cooler should also be disposed of as soon as possible, so if Jaded Justice doesn’t shy away from offense when facing him, Jules could destroy the cooler and throw away the organs (or stain them with something if it helps), or Tsao could apply force on the cooler to send it flying. If it’s near a window that can be broken or the fight happens in a long hallway, this can help a lot with getting rid of Manny’s resources. 


Jaded Justice ALSO has to make sure Manny does not get near doctors, important objects or patients (including their own) to use them as materials, UNLESS they are near Yoko and she is paying attention. That way, Jules and Tsao can turn Yoko into their ally by having her attack the enemy team. If Yoko can delay them well enough (which, considering it was mentioned that she’s undefeatable), Bikini Bottom can lose a lot of time thanks to her, giving Jaded Justice a big advantage.

Here’s what I do about that voice that says drinking will be fun:

I realized that I have romanticized notions of what drinking is like.  In my head, drinking is this magical experience.  In reality, here is what it is like: I am tense and rush to get to the first drink, I chug beer quickly, I feel down and tired for an hour or so, I pass out, I wake up at 2am to pain and shame, scared to face the day.  The reality doesn’t match the idealized image in my head.  I have worked hard to change that.  Every time the voice in my head says drinking will be fun, I say, “it’s not as good as I think it is.”  Then I run down the above scenario.  I have done this enough times to start to develop negative associations with drinking.  This makes the cravings less.

Best wishes to you!",1525132850

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day

&gt;In the United States, celebration of Mother's Day began in the early 20th century. It is not related to the many celebrations of mothers and motherhood that have occurred throughout the world over thousands of years, such as the Greek cult to Cybele, the Roman festival of Hilaria, or the Christian Mothering Sunday celebration (originally a commemoration of Mother Church, not motherhood).

&gt;The modern holiday of Mother's Day was first celebrated in 1908, when Anna Jarvis held a memorial for her mother at St Andrew's Methodist Church in Grafton, West Virginia. St Andrew's Methodist Church now holds the International Mother's Day Shrine.[8] Her campaign to make Mother's Day a recognized holiday in the United States began in 1905, the year her mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis, died. Ann Jarvis had been a peace activist who cared for wounded soldiers on both sides of the American Civil War, and created Mother's Day Work Clubs to address public health issues. Anna Jarvis wanted to honor her mother by continuing the work she started and to set aside a day to honor all mothers because she believed a mother is ""the person who has done more for you than anyone in the world""",1525132851

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; in fascism you can see pretty clearly this unclothed liberalism, 

Fascism abandoned the auspices of liberal notions of justice in favor of social Darwinism. ""Fascism"" as you are familiar with it substitutes capital's primacy and makes it subservient to a nation instead of an international business class.


&gt;proud of its nakedness under such critique and in fact emboldened to mad wars

That emboldenedness never came from the business class, at least not outside Latin America. In Italy, Germany, and Japan, the allure of war was born primarily out of geopolitical objectives that were already there being justified by revolutionary governments and warrior aristocracies. Hitler was once a Bohemian, and Mussolini's party was no stranger to the futurists. Laying this at the feet of liberal societies (the very same liberal societies that destroyed these *fundamentally identitarian movements*) is just laziness, born out of a refusal to believe that charisma can influence the course of history. Thus, all blame must fall squarely upon the business class, because Hitler and Mussolini were merely window dressing, at least to anyone autistic enough to believe that material conditions alone move the wheels of history.

&gt;state directed creation of private monopolies,

Operative phrase there being 'state directed.'

&gt;even the perversity of the burnt offering of jewish people and all the racial supremacy of it.

There aren't any dialogues, but the seiyuus for Yuki and Haruhi sing over orchestral versions of a few songs from the soundtrack, and it just doesn't do it for me. I'm listening to the orchestral album to hear the orchestra, not the actors! Keeping the vocals really restricts the arrangement possibilities, since the orchestra has to stay in the background and not overpower the vocalist. Also, they're voice actors—not classically-trained singers—so their singing clashes with the music, both due to style and skill, with Aya Hirano especially out of her depth.


I always just listen to a playlist with the four vocal songs removed, but I wish they had done arrangements without the vocals; some of the instrumental renditions they did of songs that originally had vocals (including Hare Hare Yukai (the first ED) and Koi no Mikuru Densetsu) are really great, and I wish songs like Bouken Deshou Deshou (the first OP) and Lost my music could have gotten the same treatment.

I was 155 one year ago. Today I'm 135lbs. That first year I spent ""Bulking"" or what Deku was doing. Bulking is eating more calories than your body spends. /r/gainit was a great resource in knowing how many calories I wanted to get a day and just making muscle gains in general. Again, you want to limit your fat intake so you don't dirty bulk and end up looking more round than you'd like. At the end of my bulk, I was at 155lbs (I guessed I gained around 20lbs of fat and 20lbs of muscle). The next six months I focused on cutting the excess fat off by cutting. Cutting is the opposite of bulking where you eat less amount of calories so your body eats away your fat cells for energy. By the end of my cut I lost the 20lbs of fat and kept my 20lbs of muscle. I plan to start my next bulk in about a month. 

I really recommend this video series for beginners since it's what I used generally to start being more healthy.

Jaxblade is a professional physical trainer whos a big anime fan to boot. He even has workouts on his channel that relate to different anime body types like Ippo, Saitama and even Deku!

*Post edit: Also do not be discouraged by slow progress! Any weight loss during the bulk can be discouraging I know! But just keep at it and slowly increase the calories by 50-100 a week if you find yourself stagnating or going backwards. Keep in mind your weight varies day to day depending on if you peed or pooped because that adds like an extra pound or two. It's better to weigh yourself biweekly and even then the change should be around 0.5-1lbs gained a week. Any more is likely fat and not muscle. Don't be intimidated by people in the gym and the amount they lift. Everyone has to start somewhere and 99% of the people there love seeing people who are clearly new. It's a sign that they want to improve and better themselves. Any injuries please see a doctor and take time off to heal. I was dumb and tried to lift during an injury because I wanted to go plus ultra.

Mom doesn't NEED you to buy her a condo.  A condo is actually a pretty big liability.  On top of the morthage, there are condo fees, homeowners insurance, and property taxes.  Plus, as the landlord, you'd be responsible for maintenance.  And what if Mom decides to move?  Or if she gets ill/injured ans has to live in assisted living?  You'd be stuck with a condo and need to get rid of it.

What she may need, in the future, is some financial support.  Your Mom should qualify for social security payments in her elder years.  If you and your brother could each budget a sum of money monthly to help Mom with expenses, she should be mostly okay.  

Consider starting an after-tax investment account with the intention that the money could be used to help Mom in the future, when she needs help.  My recommendation would be that you pay off your student loans, first.

But back then winning a halo mlg variant was to win 1 point 1 point 1 fucking point and ofc if you lose it was 1 point less and probably a derank.

Mercy mains, carried plats, and whatever is the meta for causals in other games kinda damage the purpose of a competitive variant. 
And halo had team slayer a more casual friendly variant not all was mlg, you was able to have good time in big team, team snipers or odd ball with rockets or whatever.

Ranks should reward skill and specific role/character experience.

For example if you go plat in ow as mercy, ok you are a plat mercy but you aren't a plat ana.

So if you queve as mercy you will get plat teams that will know you are a plat mercy and maybe you're a one trick but you are a plat mercy, however a mpre strict system should require you to be plat at 3 role characters to even queve in plat.

"jesuschristreddit","t5_38ud9","Ugh, I hate when people talk about natural selection like this, or ""survival of the fittest"".

To be clear, the concept of natural selection hinges on the idea that, when competition for resources (food, water, procreation, whatever it takes for continuing your genes) becomes scarce, those traits least suited for survival (or least fit) are the least likely to. If there's resources for a population many times that which currently exists, then natural selection has a much lower threshold, if there's no predators, it's lower still.

Natural selection doesn't mean ""throw them out in the woods and see if they can survive in nature"", nor does ""survival of the fittest"" necessarily mean ""stronger"". That medical advancements and technology exist that allow people to survive diseases and conditions that once would have been death sentences is the very epitome of survival of the fittest. Natural selection selected for these traits, because they made us most fit to survive in our environment – no different than wolves developed packs or other animals developed complex social hierarchies such as herds and hives.

I mean, I get what you're saying, but saying technology has ""dumbed down"" society/humans until it ""removed natural selection"" is at best naive and worse still, it engages in the very kind of anti-intellectualism that it claims to disregard.

Sure, technology has dramatically shifted the minimum threshold for survival, but there's an abundance of resources.

It'll sort itself out, eventually.

"AshVsEvilDead","t5_34hei","I also hated the ending, but not for the same reasons. ""Lazily written"" is an excellent diagnosis. 

What they did to Kelly's character was particularly annoying. She wakes up from death and *apologizes* to Ash for not being the badass he is. I lost count of the number of times she bailed him out of trouble in past seasons, and not defeating Ruby single-handed was nothing to be ashamed of (Ash couldn't do it, either). Totally killed my respect for the character, and the pointless bit with her shooting deadites in anger two minutes later didn't revive it.

I had a hard time believing that Ash's daughter and friends, who stood by him through so much (including his epic thoughtlessness and stupidity) would just let themselves be herded into a truck like so many refugees, leaving him alone to the fight. The tank stuff was funny, and in the spirit of the show, but it was awfully convenient that it just happened to be there. Ash defeating the Big Evil with a little help from his friends would not have diminished the character (not much there to diminish in the first place) and would have been more satisfying.

I suppose the makers were hedging their bets by doing this, and having the other characters intact implies that something may come of all the fan bitching for more. However, I believe Bruce Campbell when he says he wants out. Better to go before he trades in the boomstick for a walking stick.

I hated the Mad Max ending at first, on the principle that they should not leave us wanting more when we know that we're not getting more. But it is easy to reconcile with a true ending. Ash died, and he went to Ash Heaven. Boobs, bullets, hot wheels and an enemy to fight; what else would it look like?  I'm actually kind of happy for him.",1525132860

Since you're probably home by now, play the role of the good slave for one last night. If safe to do so, get your SS card, birth certificate, and anything else that will be hard to replace. Consider anything you leave behind gone forever, since they'll destroy it to punish you.

Tomorrow, go to school and don't come home. Use bike and public transportation, since they're harder to trace. 

You'll need cash. If you've got money in the bank and you were a minor when you deposited it, withdraw it now, since they're going to take it to punish you. Hell, withdraw everything ASAP.

Use credit cards to buy some clothes/toiletries, then flush the card. You don't want to use it since they can trace your purchases. With cash, buy a prepaid phone (basic burner). 
When you buy your new phone, ditch your old one. For this, you can remove the lock code and put a note on it saying ""free phone"". Or, you could slip it into a package going far away. This will especially help if you are planning on leaving the area. (i.e. mail it to San Francisco and take a bus to Boston)

The point is, get rid of your old phone, especially if it is a smartphone. Your parents can shut off the old phone as punishment, and smartphones can be traced to within ten meters. 

If there are photos or other files you want to keep, load them onto a thumb drive and keep it with you. 

Now, go to the police station to file charges and tell them that your parents may file a missing person thingy. Give the cops your new phone number, so they can contact you. 

If you couldn't grab them, go to the Social Security administration to get a new card and to city records to get a new  copy of your birth certificate. 

Now, the old ""you"" needs to disappear. Go to a thrift shop and get some clothes that look completely different and donate/toss your old clothes. Dye your hair and/or get it into a completely different look. If you have a small chest, add something to make it look larger; on the other hand, if you have a large bosum, get some sort of wrap to visually shrink. Maybe change your posture. Whatever you do, make sure you don't look anything like what you did before. 

With your burner phone, call your mother, and get her to pick you up, then go to a new bank to set up your new account. If you're fast enough, you might be able to salvage more of your money. Finish out the semester, then change schools. ",1525132862

If previous defamation suits got thrown out because the President cannot defame on twitter because it is all hyperbole, then it follows that you can't not defame and also be defamed. ie if everything surrounding the president is ridiculous (read the Jacobus case thats basically what the court said) then her statements made to the media are part of the circus and the clause in the NDA making her liable for defamation fall away!

Nothing wrong with admitting things. Now you can talk to him about the marvels of economies of scale and network effects. Consider how little it takes in terms of workers to produce steel, cars, copies of videogame software, aggricultural output, etc.

We just so happen to live in an increasingly platform based economy, consider [this read](https://slate.com/business/2018/01/after-all-the-talk-about-a-u-s-skills-shortage-the-real-problem-may-be-an-employer-shortage.html) ([the study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23687) quoted that talks about markups is quite impressive) or [this](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/why-amazon-is-eating-the-world/).

So on the one hand, we see the government increasingly finance low skill work for most people, while on the other, a small number of owners and entrepreneurs reap the rewards from productivity gains. That's where all this new 'productivity' comes from. Platforms that can deliver a crazy amount of value to customers ([consider this small glance into the real economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoVomqpPqto&amp;t=16m56s)). It's not so much that a small number of people are crazy productive all of a sudden, while others are not. We're just solving middle skill employment, and the high end is more about rent, royalties and dividends. While the low end can out-compete automation, as long as we're willed to go down with wages and up with work time/density.

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","**Summary**


Due to Manny’s huge amount of resources and MAKS’ Stand’s invincibility, delaying them can be moderate to hard in terms of difficulty. Manny can overrun Jaded Justice and MAKS can prove to be a big distraction if Evolution latches Jules or Tsao’s wheels or uses electronics well enough against them. If Bikini Bottom is encountered, Jules and Tsao should first focus on Manny if they make Evolution miss and can defend against it. If not, retreat is advisable and if they follow, a surprise attack from a room. In the case where Jaded Justice succeeds, they should focus on getting rid of Manny’s cooler and other things he could use to create minions from. If Manny is pressured into exposing his Stand, he must be retired immediately. Then, MAKS should be incapacitated as soon as possible after that, with Evolution being avoided or forced to miss if possible. The patient should be placed in a safe spot before fighting them, to not become a hindrance.


**Walkthrough:**


Jaded Justice enters the building. They must be sneaky to not be noticed by their enemy if they happen to be near, but also fast to keep up with them. Non-electronics (such as a second wheelchair for the patient) can also be used to make carrying the patient easier (or to just use as shields in the case of an encounter.)


*Green:* preferable path for Jaded Justice


*Purple:* presumed preferable path for Bikini Bottom (encounter zones could also happen at other crossroads if they decide to take another path to meet Jaded Justice face to face, however, due to the force-based speed boost that Jaded Justice will use, I don’t think they will meet at those other crossroads)


*Yellow:* presumed encounter

[Ground Floor](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7TiTbV0Ww_VNmfCFl9fJ3VNAEa68UyiT2zTpKd9J3Rl2eUWTXV758LSuy0QbsKNYH2ysSRke7jvArkTizsgVqGuiUo7G-AvIMI8H5h3Jgk0cOdsbQWAEFjYdI9EGd6OXslxY6Sox)


[Floor 1](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ybEpgou4m1UTB9lQgB-bN0Z_4Px1elB6VU5IO6hWLzKogPVE66gO7nicM6VNoKpsZNKXcyrlIaCjF8r0ANDArCwJn1vuGiXwDlGGdUjNuYtO-wQj6XhRvY3wC_4DNl0B3ObZ2FEP)


Two preferable paths on the second floor. No encounter zones drawn because they could happen at anytime, depending whether or not Bikini Bottom can catch up with Jaded Justice if they’re behind or viceversa (the viceversa is more likely due to Jaded Justice’s speed boost tactic).


[Final Floor](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1z7Sbm1Drm0yzXmgEUI9Jwdu_QTRvS9LnDJZHuFTxO_Q2s2kCcop4AhqmgGXZH4aTDD2AlRI-hJe1M2XdRiYyOPlht0tDqu5NUpCiuphnpdRd4U2yGepucDDmGl1nlF-CTYJGIkL)


Once again, encounters can happen at anytime if the enemy team isn’t retired yet. Also, as an extra, here’s the Yoko version of the ground floor:


[Ground Floor Yoko tactic version](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W4mtLp4Js7XfmRawZpBgwAaslL-jbxadOFNoP_6DvIloCHCy_GlTktWuAZx_QQmZNgFs2v9nPazObL4ESjkei5SsH3-efo1Z45s-r1AE-D_ZSe9f7ytI7wpKewus4Epxkg0r4kbW)


Jaded Justice camp in that area (yellow), looking for Bikini Bottom (waiting for them to take one of the two preferable paths. If they don’t and see them taking another path, they rush for the stairs or wait somewhere else to meet them and face them.. They attack them on sight and do their best to make sure the fight gets near Yoko (red and pink are the preferable path she should take for us, if she takes too long to get to that hallway, the plan is ditched and Jaded Justice either fight or retreat). Once the fight is near Yoko, Jaded Justice has to force Manny and MAKS to do enough damage to provoke her. Once she gets provoked, Jaded Justice leaves them to deal with her and rush straight for the finish without notable problems, unless Manny and MAKS somehow manage to escape Yoko and keep up with them. I personally think the Yoko strategy is very helpful, since Manny and MAKS have a higher chance of provoking her with their abilities than Jules and Tsao. They can also wait for Yoko in the previous version, right at the stairway, however Jaded Justice have to reach there first for it to work.

*The following is a party political broadcast by the Conservative Party*

**fade into a scene of Theresa May and a small child who has a teddy bear standing in a white room. There is a door to the right**

May: The people of Britain need a strong and stable leadership. A captain who will steer us with confidence through an uncertain Brexit and hard financial times.

**May walks to the child**

May: Up and down the country, Conservative MPs are working hard to ensure that we maintain a good standard of living, and that public services are being funded. Labour on the other hand think it's okay to hit children.

**May strikes the child. The child begins to cry**

May: See that? I didn't strike that child, the Labour Party instead didn't stop me from accidentally knocking the child with my hand.

**May strikes the child again. The child cries louder**

May: That time I did strike the child. Do you notice any Labour MPs coming to help? No. That's because Labour like hitting children.

**May takes the childs arm and breaks it. The child is inconsolable**

May: Look at the poor child! Look at how they suffer, and do you notice who isn't stopping the suffering? Jeremy Corbyn. You see Jeremy Corbyn enjoys children getting hurt. He practically lives off it.

**May wrestles the teddy bear from the child, and lights it on fire**

**The door to the right bursts open. Jeremy Corbyn rushes in and stamps the bear out**

May: Only now when criticised does Jeremy Corbyn do something, but look at what he's done! Not only has he stamped all over the treasured childhood posession of an innocent young person! He's also denied them of a fire that would have kept them warm in the cold winter months!

**May strikes the child again. The child is a mess of tears and other face gunk**

Jeremy: Please Theresa, what are you doing?! Stop hitting the child!

May: Do you see how Jeremy doesn't have the spine to stop the child getting hurt? He only wants to use words. The Conservative party would use long range criuse missiles against people who hurt children.

**May goes to strike the child again. Jeremy grabs her arm and stops her**

May: But now we see the true nature of Jeremy Corbyn! A violent bully who will hurt innocents whilst claiming to be protecting the interests of other innocents!

**Jeremy releases Mays arm and picks up and comforts the child, mumbling about needing to find medical assistance and the childs parents. Exeunt stage right**

May: And now the most vile underbelly of the Labour Party! See how Jeremy Corbyn kidknapps the child and will no doubt take them to some form of pedophile party!

**Fade to white. The words *""The Conservatives; Because Jeremy Corbyn should be stopping things he has no control over, and if he does, we'll criticize him anyway""* appear on the screen**",1525132865

In the footage, he appears to be standing in an isolated area, far from the fence, and not seeming to pose any threat to the lives of Israeli soldiers. He is currently in need of a knee replacement operation to be able to walk again.""
""Despite this, the Israeli army reinforced its forces – deploying tanks, military vehicles, soldiers and snipers along the Gaza fence – and gave orders to shoot anyone within several hundred metres of the fence.

While some protesters have attempted to approach the fence, threw stones in the direction of Israeli soldiers or burnt tyres, social media videos, as well as eyewitness testimonies gathered by Amnesty International, Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups, show that Israeli soldiers shot unarmed protesters, bystanders, journalists and medical staff approximately 150-400m from the fence, where they did not pose any threat. ""

Even if they had been crossing the border, civilized nations arrest unarmed persons who cross the border to protest. They don't shoot at those who are standing still far from the border. 

Imagine the international outcry if Trump were to order US troops to shoot at unarmed people in Mexico who approach the border, without even crossing it. ",1525132865

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","A little piece of a Reagan speech at cpac 77.

The people who have read this speech are not being pushed out of the party, but projection is a key part of liberal strategy today, projecting racism, violence, misogyny, and so too is your mistaken opinion here.

""I have always been puzzled by the inability of some political and media types to understand exactly what is meant by adherence to political principle. All too often in the press and the television evening news it is treated as a call for “ideological purity.” Whatever ideology may mean — and it seems to mean a variety of things, depending upon who is using it — **it always conjures up in my mind a picture of a rigid, irrational clinging to abstract theory in the face of reality. We have to recognize that in this country “ideology” is a scare word. And for good reason. Marxist-Leninism is, to give but one example, an ideology.** All the facts of the real world have to be fitted to the Procrustean bed of Marx and Lenin. If the facts don’t happen to fit the ideology, the facts are chopped off and discarded.

I consider this to be the complete opposite to principled conservatism. If there is any political viewpoint in this world which is free from slavish adherence to abstraction, it is American conservatism.

When a conservative states that the free market is the best mechanism ever devised by the mind of man to meet material needs, he is merely stating what a careful examination of the real world has told him is the truth.

When a conservative says that totalitarian Communism is an absolute enemy of human freedom he is not theorizing — he is reporting the ugly reality captured so unforgettably in the writings of Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

When a conservative says it is bad for the government to spend more than it takes in, he is simply showing the same common sense that tells him to come in out of the rain.

When a conservative says that busing does not work, he is not appealing to some theory of education — he is merely reporting what he has seen down at the local school.

When a conservative quotes Jefferson that government that is closest to the people is best, it is because he knows that Jefferson risked his life, his fortune and his sacred honor to make certain that what he and his fellow patriots learned from experience was not crushed by an ideology of empire.

**Conservatism is the antithesis of the kind of ideological fanaticism that has brought so much horror and destruction to the world.** The common sense and common decency of ordinary men and women, working out their own lives in their own way — this is the heart of American conservatism today. Conservative wisdom and principles are derived from willingness to learn, not just from what is going on now, but from what has happened before.

**The principles of conservatism are sound because they are based on what men and women have discovered through experience in not just one generation or a dozen, but in all the combined experience of mankind. When we conservatives say that we know something about political affairs, and that we know can be stated as principles, we are saying that the principles we hold dear are those that have been found, through experience, to be ultimately beneficial for individuals, for families, for communities and for nations — found through the often bitter testing of pain, or sacrifice and sorrow.**""

That last part is him explaining that conservatism is not an ideology by some philosopher from ages past that has never worked in practice, it's the combined wisdom of human experience as far back as history records.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","I'm vegan primarily for the animals, and the environmental savings are a bonus. It's not one dimensional.

I can counter all that other stuff you wrote with one sentence: we feed animals plants too.

For instance, 90% of soy is fed to livestock.

Vegans do the best they can. I avoid palm oil, avacado, and cashews for instance.

Planes have nothing to do with veganism. Non vegans fly too.

But as an environmentalist, I don't own a car. I'm sterile. And I fly very infrequently.

Despite what you may have heard, veganism is not a cult. I don't avoid animal products just because they come from animals, but because the cases where they are produced with ethical treatment to animals is so few and far between it's simply unrealistic. 

Roadkill, for instance, is vegan.

I don't eat honey because they clip the Queens wings, they kill tons of bees squished between panels, they smoke them out, their honey is stolen and replaced with sugar water, theyre neglected in the winter, etc. And honey isn't even difficult to replace with more ethical alternatives like maple syrup.


Difference between vegans and you. Vegans do the best they can, where as you just pull the nirvana fallacy and don't do anything.

You would rather pay for someone to stick their fists up a cows ass, separate the calf, take the milk, stuff the cow up with corn and soy, and pull a knife across their throat because a veggie burger is ""too extreme"".

So many of our native species are utterly defenceless because they evolved in an environment where they had no natural predators, including penguins, a multitude of flightless birds, lizards, the world's largest wood pidgeon, some species of parrot and a bunch more which most people have never even heard of.

"television","t5_2qh6e","&gt; Right, but is that's because Dolores is the focus of the show in a lot of ways, so they are explaining her backstory? Or is it because no other host remembers their past like that?

Dolores is the only one to become fully sentient.  Maeve is ""awake"" and has 20 on her intellect, but it was shown even with that she was *still* following her programming.  The rest are like Maeve without the 20 in her intellect. 

That's a pretty key difference between Dolores and the rest of the machines.  As for the Wyatt thing, it's specifically stated in one of the last episodes of season 1 that they buried the Wyatt personality deep in Dolores' substructure, not merged it.  Robert differentiates between the two when he's basically giving Dolores the gun.  Killing Robert acts as a triger to free the last part of her consciousness and when that happened the Wyatt and Dolores personalities will merge.

This is all stuff that happens in the first season and is spelled out pretty clearly in the last two-three episodes, might have been a while since you watched them, but I literally just got done rewatching season 1 an hour before the season 2 started so it's all still fresh in my mind.",1525132870

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;atheism is the rejection of belief. I do not understand why theists continue to be confused by this distinction.

&gt;Atheists do not have confidence in things not seen.

I believe my sight to be accurate, I believe that my sight is the only reliable metric to judge truth, and I believe that anything that hasn't been verified by sight should be rejected. As you can see I clearly only reject beliefs - I have none of my own!

Except the ~~irreligious~~ **religious** do provide reasons for their ~~lack of~~ belief, and are immediately accused by ~~theists~~ **atheists**, variously, as liars or of being in denial or of being ~~demonically~~ **emotionally** influenced or told that ~~God made them wrongly~~ **they are indoctrinated**, or any number of other excuses ~~theists~~ **atheists** give for not listening to what the ~~irreligious~~ **religious** have to say.


And so the ~~irreligious~~ **religious** become frustrated.

And then the ~~theists~~ **atheists** accuse the ~~irreligious~~ **religious** of being naturally ~~angry~~ **crazy**. ~~Theists~~ **Atheists** lie and distort and then have the audacity to accuse the ~~irreligious~~ **religious** of the same.


&gt;Why? Why should every question have an answer? Why is it only the theist who demands that the irreligious have complete knowledge, and not the other way around?

Literally doesn't realize I was pointing out that OP was actually demanding theists have all answers; ""But there still remains the same questions about belief in a God including unanswered questions about the Bible, Quran, omniscience, first cause, etc.""

&gt;If your god is real, then it should be trivial to demonstrate real, tangible effects of this god that can't be explained by anything else. If your god has performed miracles, there should be tangible evidence above and beyond mere anecdotes and holy books.

To verify your religion you must pass these tests. I have created these tests and you must be able to pass them. If you fail to then this proves you are wrong. There is no issue with my tests, they are 100% perfect in every way.

&gt; If there is only one truth, then surely no religion would divide into irreconcilable sects; the Shiites and Sunnis would have no cause to murder each other.

For religion to be true there must be no disagreements! 

&gt;And here we get to the core of the problem. Here, we see why the Sunni and Shiites brutalize each other and why Islam can never truly be called the religion of peace.

Points out how Islam fails at a standard you seem to have on your own accord set for it. #victory!

&gt;It's because Belief is more important to the religious than Truth. It's more important for you to believe than for what you believe to be true.

Literally lies saying the religious care for beliefs over truth. Perhaps doesn't understand what a belief even is. 

&gt;And that's why I can confidently say that you are a liar, without fear of contradiction.

Continues to call me a liar. 

Doesn't realize the point I made was how atheists think they are justified in their atheism because theists cannot convince them of theism. Atheists often think they don't need to justify there own positions because of this.",1525132872

I'd be in favour of taking a run at Joe Thornton but I don't think it's realistic. If there isn't a fantastic opportunity (Tavares or a trade or something) then I would want to try Nylander at center. The UFA market is a bit of a wasteland in terms of value beyond those two - all the other good players are probably going to get badly overpaid.

I've argued this for a while, but if they can make a creative trade to ship out Nathan Horton, even if it means giving up a low draft pick or prospect, they should jump at the chance because if not they're looking at eating $5.3 million or facing a very difficult 2019-20 cap situation.

They can also continue to do their shopping overseas. Lawerence Pilut is reportedly going to Buffalo, but they could look at Joel Persson (an RHD), or see if any KHLers want to make the jump (1995 born Vladmir Tkackyov for example).",1525132872

It’s shitty that (generally)  women are allowed to say no to romantic feelings and if the man isn’t interested in just a friendship that they “only wanted her for her body”.  It’s like no, I have lots of friends, I wanted to have an awesome partner that I could have sex with.  Just as you aren’t interested in a romantic relationship I’m not interested in a platonic one.

&gt; he Priest-Child sex scandals that were covered up by priests, bishops, and cardinals

I guess you haven't heard how most of the cases were plants, false accusations, and most of the victims being boys, which means these ""sacred men"" are homosexual plants who intended to commit these crimes since before being ordained.

But let's look at the facts:

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/mar/11/catholic-abuse-priests

As you see, homosexual pedophilia is the most common one among catholic priests. Since the Church doesn't even allow people under gave sin to receive consecrated form, much less to take the habit, we can safely assume these men lied their way into the role and aren't real priests in the eyes of God (you know, the CEO and owner of the Catholic Church). These are, instead, liars, pretenders, and must be dealt with accordingly.

And while my next point doesn't justify anything these ""priests"" do, I have done my share of research by talking with one aquitance whose job is being a social worker, and plenty of youtube videos and articles about it, and learned the highes pedophilia rates are among music teachers and parents. It makes sense, as these two roles give you easier and faster access to children: A music teacher has a whole curricular year to groom more than one child into accepting his abuse. Riskier, but quicker than a parent, who has to first convince a woman to marry him, a period in which plenty of them will see several red flags and break up with him on time. He then has to have children with her, and play the ""dedicated father"" part until he deems the child old enough to be abused. Not many monsters are willing to take this risk/way for so long, so the easiest and less risky path for them is just rent a child from a pedophilia ring.

Becoming a priest is an arduous path to take even for virtuous men, so it's not easy to become a ""priest pedophile"". The path is slow and risky, as you aren't left alone with children under normal circunstances. You'll work alongside adults most of the time, and it takes a lot of restraint to not look at the object of your desire with ""that look"" and be discovered (am married woman, still hard not to stare at the guys in the gym). So if these plants were able to show enough restraint to be allowed to remain alone with children in a position that doesn't require it at all, then why did they abuse these children? The simplest answer is usually the correct one: Because that was their intention all along. There are easier ways to get to be alone with a child. There are less risky ways to get to be alone with a child. And then there's the absolute best way of doing so, by renting one. 

You now know the answer to the ""pedophile priests"" enigma. They got in via lying, cheating and pretending. They were able to restrain themselves for enough time to be entrusted with children, and they abused them then and there. They don't lack restraint. They didn't just ""lost control of themselves"". It was all planned. Just throw a few girls into the mix in order to make the truth less obvious and be done.

&gt; But, the Church does good things as well.

Afterwards I've had increased telepathic/empath and future seeing capabilities...
I was hesitant about going to my daughters school one day, my inner voice kept saying ""don't go"" ""don't go"" and I went against my better judgement...sure enough my psychopath stalker was there serving me a fake warrant. I'm connected to God and the universe in away others simply won't understand...I see the future, and my future self has been guiding me far away from toxic people and things.  ",1525132878

Oh I know that, that's why I said ""the progressive left""

&gt;This has nothing to do with Marxism, I was just providing an example.

A quote not from Marx would have been better. I agree with the premise, but communism an Marxism has given us some hellfull socieities.

&gt;If you're limiting sexual partners, you're not allowing for personal freedom, which is not very libertarian of you. It's fine to have your own opinion, but the second you force it on people or berate people online about it, you give up all ability to call yourself a libertarian.

You do know that its no legal in California for people with HIV to spread it to others knowingly, without telling them and without legal recourse, right?

This is the kind of example that my context was about

&gt;If she made herself blind, so what? She made the choice, she has to live with it now, not you.

Except she's now on disability via taxpayer dollars. That's not far to the taxpayers, so she shouldn't have been allowed to do that, or should be stripped of disability and instead be put in a psych ward

&gt; What about piercings? Do you want those banned too?

No because these dont prevent contribution to society

&gt;Mental health options and treatment are limited to the rich in the USA, so your argument again falls short.

We can stop the billions in AID to Israel and cut off all the illegals from Welfare, and there would plenty enough to cover mental health and free health insurance, so no, my argument does not fall short

&gt;Weird how I'm a socialist and turn out to be a better libertarian than you are 🤔.

Socialism leads to Communism. 

Socialism, in theory, is a decent premise, but in reality will transform via some black swan into something bad eventually. Take Sweden for example, they ended up with a feminist virtue signaling government which lacked the foresight to see that importing a Million radicals who are part of a death/pedo cult, 90+% of which remain for years on welfare and do not come off it, end up fucking up their whole socialism experiment because of this sort of foreseen by many, mistake. Also they are now top in rapes in Europe as well.

Not according to the dictionary - which is what is being discussed here.  

&gt;And if a significant number of people feel that the society of which they are a part has systemic problems, which prevent it from being a good society for them, then we are quite a ways from “moral aversion” of the type you are attempting to reverse things to.

The EXACT same thing can be said of the mormons, the muslims, and all the other religious groups.  It is the same motivation - changing society to be more preferable in relation to a belief system.  You even have your sacred text and prophet.

&gt;Since this is a conversation that’s been going on, without even a great change in vocabulary, since the 1830s, partisans of various positions of social change naturally have pretty well developed arguments about why change is necessary and how it will have to move forward, while partisans of some form of the status quo often just dig in their heels.

Sure - here we are nearly 200 years on with zero of the predictions coming true and the countries that TRULY suck are the ones that tried (at least nominally) to implement the message of the sacred texts.

There's a starter mech or two (maybe just the Shadow Hawk) that bafflingly has LRMs *and* SRMs. This is never a good idea. Just load more LRMs instead.

Heat management is crucial; if you're able to Alpha Strike every turn and not build much heat (like the stock Shadow Hawk), you have too many Heat Sinks. Nix a couple of them in favor of more armor or firepower.


A good way to make a frontline mech is to cut JJs off one of your starting Mediums and add more armor. Keep in mind you're trading evasion for raw armor. The Blackjack is a good choice for this, as jumping every turn for max evasion causes it to get very hot anyways.

They then legally obtained DNA from him once, got a shaky match, obtained a second, better sample, and got a better match, and then arrested him.

"walkingwarrobots","t5_3al50","Hi wurda. I’m not really sure those forms can work for a few reasons:
It’s actually very hard to spot a tanker only by looking at his stats. There are tons of ways a tanker can mask what he’s doing. I think only a few let their stats look as obvious as the one showcased in one of today’s posts. There’s soft tanking (champ to master, a lot of that going on these last few days, Master to Expert), Regular tanking (Diamond/Gold) hardcore tanking (the guy in silver) and ultra hardcore (Bronze 800 points. Difficult, but possible). But if someone takes soft and regular “flavors” of tanking as just plain tanking, waiting times on Low Priority Q will get lower than Regular Queue.

Personal story: fought hard until January this year to get my 10 to 8 hangar to Master. Got bored. Played the bots and weapons I didn’t like (bots lvl 4, weapons lvl 1-2) just to get enough ads to complete gold tasks. Upgraded the things I liked to 12-10 in the meantime. After I ran out out Silver I started to play again, but now with my good hangar. Then the stats started to look like soft tanking: at Expert 2, 900K damage, 75-80% wins. If someone buys $100 worth of gold to speed up upgrades, his stats will look like a tanker’s in 40 games or so. 
Being so prone to false positives, it’s hard to believe that Pixonic takes those forms seriously. And that’s a reasonable thing to do (ignore bad dataset). No man power or spreadsheet can solve a bad dataset problem.

I know this is getting long, but bare with me a little more, because this is my main point : the ban on tankers topics is what makes it difficult to search for them. If the general player doesn’t know how to tank, or the multiple different ways available to do it, how is he supposed to reliably identify a tanker? 

The best way ATM to look for tankers is server side, because the information that users generate is of bad quality. And the quality is the result of bad information, because most of the information outlets for the game decided that they shouldn’t disclose it. I imagine the intentions were good, but the results are underwhelming.

By the way Pixonic calls LPQ “leaver’s queue” and not tankers queue for a reason. You don’t get penalized for tanking, only for leaving.",1525132881

If you upgrade to a full\-sensor you probably wont be able to use your current lenses. In that case you might as well reevaluate sticking with Nikon, too.

When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World is a classic work of social psychology by Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter which studied a small UFO religion in Chicago called the Seekers that believed in an imminent apocalypse and its coping mechanisms after the event did not occur. Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance can account for the psychological consequences of disconfirmed expectations. One of the first published cases of dissonance was reported in this book.

&gt; Newly released documents show Virginia&amp;#039;s largest public university granted the conservative Charles Koch Foundation a say in the hiring and firing of professors in exchange for millions of dollars in donations.

&gt; The documents&amp;#039; release follows years of denials from George Mason University that the donations inhibit academic freedom.

&gt; The school&amp;#039;s relationship with the foundation has received increased scrutiny since 2016 when Mason renamed its law school for conservative jurist Antonin Scalia.

"starbucks","t5_2qwza","So, I've been with the bux for less than 6 months and I'm currently training to be a shift. I basically watch all my current shifts like a hawk so I can get a good feel of how they work everything out.

First and foremost, my shifts have a mini powwow when handing off. Mid comes in 10 minutes early, Am stays 10 minutes late. So they have 20 minutes together to talk about how the day went, what did get done and what still has to get done. That way, mid can figure out breaks and whatnot accordingly.

Second, use the DCR to plan! Know who you have and keep in mind all your partners strong and weak suites. If it's been a busy day, keep aces in places (by remember that you should move everyone around so they don't get burnt out in one role for a full shift). That way everything will get done within a reasonable amount of time. If you have a strong bar and POS, they can multitask little things to help the close go smoothly.

Third, if it's been really busy and you notice you and your partners are having a really rough go of it, give everyone an extra 10. Seriously. As long as you don't make it a bad habit. Once in awhile, frap roast hits the fan and everyone needs a break to compose themselves. 

Lastly, it's okay to have a bad close. It's okay to struggle sometimes. Keep you head up, put pride in your work, and remember that it's really - honestly - just coffee. You're doing great!",1525132886

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","People are saying no, but I think you could potentially be a bit behind. By my sophomore year as an electrical engineer was over, I had completed Circuits I, Circuits II, Logic Circuits, EE lab, and Intro to Semiconductors. That's pretty much one semester's worth of classes. I suspect it's similar for mechanical engineers.

Some people might point out that you can get more of your gen-eds done in that time and therefore it all balances out! But lots of classes in engineering have prerequisites, and you'll find out that often two classes are at the same time and so you can't fit all of the courses into one semester anyway.

Most engineers take 4.5 - 5 years to graduate if they don't come in with any AP credit. If you go in with the expectation that it will take you 5 years, I think it's not really a big deal, and no employer will hold it against you anyway. You will need to take a big courseload in CC. Make SURE you get any prerequisites for engineering out of the way. That means chemistry, physics,  calculus, and linear algebra. I would also take this opportunity to learn computer programming, a skill that is extremely helpful in the workplace.

Also you need to keep in mind that depending on how the transfer works, you may get credit for those courses, but not a grade. Meaning all of your classes once you transfer will count more towards your GPA. You will need to work hard and get good grades.",1525132886

"nba","t5_2qo4s","lol.  Youre missing the point.

Its not significant because its clearly not the best MVP season ever, and it only occurred because Curry is a complete media darling.  

One fat old Boston media member behind a keyboard voted for Carmelo Anthony because he hates LeBron.  Does that make Currys 2016 season better than LeBrons 2013?  There are several arguments for either side, but none of those arguments are ""well LeBron got one less first place vote because of a troll vote, and Currys was unanimous so I guess Curry had the better season.""

The whole ""unanimous"" thing means absolutely nothing.  I'm kind of hoping Harden gets all the 1st place votes this year just so Warriors fans will shut up about it lmfao.

&gt; Newly released documents show Virginia&amp;#039;s largest public university granted the conservative Charles Koch Foundation a say in the hiring and firing of professors in exchange for millions of dollars in donations.

&gt; The documents&amp;#039; release follows years of denials from George Mason University that the donations inhibit academic freedom.

&gt; The school&amp;#039;s relationship with the foundation has received increased scrutiny since 2016 when Mason renamed its law school for conservative jurist Antonin Scalia.

Was in the first definition that Aristotle proposed as an example of potential infinities. 

&gt;You still haven't explained why we can supposedly ignore the definition of infinity when comparing two different sets of infinity (for lack of a better phrase).

The issue is you aren't ignoring the definition of infinity, it's the definition itself that leads to certain paradoxes. [Cantor's Diagonal Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) is the math that was used to explain why you can claim certain infinities are greater. 

I was really trying an ELI5 with the groupings of numbers to explain. If your groups/sets can form a resonance to cancel each other out then they are the same. If they don't, then they are different. For this proof all we need is to find one set that isn't equal to any others, as not equal will show one infinity to be greater than the other. Cantor's Diagonal Agrument is the proof of that.

The 'back' loading is placing items after the split action.

What happens if you have a stack inserter placing items on the back of the splitter from the front side? You'd need the adjustable inserters mod, of course. Or.. what about adjusting the placement orientation to be front vs middle vs back of the splitter, using the same mod?

Every bank I’ve worked at has a coin counting machine, we just have to use it for your coin ourselves as 9 times out of 10 there are nails, pushpins, foreign coin, etcetera in the buckets of change. So we charge a percentage to have to sort your coin of things that would break these million dollar (some for less, but the good ones are expensive AF from what’s I hear) machines, though not anywhere close to Coinstar fees.

Equally, we do not accept rolled coin anymore, at all three banks I’ve worked at, due to the fact that we can’t trust they were rolled properly unless in armored service wrapping, so the poor people used to the old ways of banking, I.E. bringing in rolled coin for cash or deposit, get all their hard work smashed by people like me having to put it through the coin machine and charging the percentage fee anyways.

It is worth noting I have never seen coin properly rolled for the amount a customer says it is, so I don’t blame the bank for doing that, as, if the coin is wrong when we sell it, the armored services charge us out the ass.",1525132891

"AskPhotography","t5_2t96o","Next time you're at a shop with a bunch of Nikon gear, try holding a D7500. The other cameras I list are about the same size.

Now that I'm used to the controls on the professional cameras, I'd have a very hard time going back to something like your D60. But if you're not used to those controls, not having them isn't going to be a problem.

The D200 is definitely a lot bigger than the D60. I personally like the extra size, but I shoot with big lenses and big lights that would feel extremely unbalanced on a smaller camera. Hell, I use battery grips that make the camera even more massive.

IMO, if you're mostly using automatic or priority modes, the D60 or a comparable modern body (D5600) is going to be fine. Great even; that small size is very handy. If you want to shoot in manual mode, it helps to have easy access to ISO, shutter speed, and aperture afforded by a high end camera.

Matt Granger discusses old cameras in terms of the features and controls. [He compares a D200 against a D3000.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV8cBU2GjWc)

As far as whether or not you would benefit from a more modern camera/sensor... It really comes down to what kinds of conditions you shoot in. In daylight, my D200 is absolutely amazing. There's very little the D7200 can do that the D200 cannot. The D7200 performs much better indoors though. On the D200, I need to use my fastest lenses, or use lighting. I normally shoot with lighting, so that's cool. But there are a few times when I have to shoot ambient only, which rules the 200 out.",1525132891

I get that it would be political suicide, but I'm just tired of the bullshit. 

I want to hear Luke Messer or Todd Rokita say ""Hell yeah, Mike Braun, I *have* been a politician my whole life. For God's sake, I'm running for the Republican nomination, I'm not going to apologize for working hard to advance conservative values for the past 20 years. Everyone on this stage is either a politician or wants to be one, and while you were voting for and donating to Democrats, I was working to elect Republicans and pass conservative policies.""

Obviously I am badly in the minority here, but it just amazes me that politics is literally the only field where experience is a bad thing. No one would walk into a restaurant and ask for a chef without culinary experience. I've never heard anyone say ""I don't want that teacher to be hired, she's been in education too long."" But in politics it's somehow legitimate. Going after someone for being a politician, when you yourself are running for office, is just the most rhetorically lazy attack in the world. It'd be one thing if Braun would actually cite corrupt things Messer and Rokita have done (which there are arguably plenty of!), but he didn't.

The 9ers traded for Jimmy and won 6 straight games. They deserve a measure of respect for that. Projecting them to be in the NFC Championship Game might be a little much, though. And projecting a regression for the Bears is very bold or said without knowledge of their offseason. Or maybe he anticipates serious growing pains with the new coaching staff.

Either way, who cares what this guy thinks. Who cares what anyone really thinks at this point. I think the Bears are poised to strike and most people that paid attention agree.

&gt; Huge icebergs could be towed from Antarctica to Cape Town in a bid to solve South Africa&amp;#039;s worst drought in a century.

&gt; Tough water restrictions are already in place and Cape Town authorities have warned that taps could run dry altogether as soon as next year if winter rains do not come to the rescue of the port city&amp;#039;s four million residents.

&gt; Cape Town-based Sloane said his team could wrap passing icebergs in fabric skirts to protect them and reduce evaporation.

In either case, the RAC or TCD only measures how many tasks where submitted multiplied by a difficulty factor for the task (determined by the project admin). Hosts will only get credit for the useful work they do. 

In the case of this analysis, TCD would actually be fairly useful (but also require significantly more code). It would let me cut out hosts who haven't submitted any tasks in a given amount of time rather than my current method of setting a minimum RAC.

I recommend putting your cynicism aside. If you’re helping in your community, good for you. You’ll probably get way less thanks for it than you deserve. But don’t become bitter or cold. Be one of the good people in the world, and yes that includes sending benign well wishes to people. Because even though they may not do much, at least they aren’t hurtful comments that serve only to make a difficult life more painful. ",1525132897

IMHO, if you build both, you're wasting money on stats for mana that you don't need and delaying the power-spike of a more suitable AP item. 

Instead you should consider one of these as a second item:

* Void Staff: if there are one or more tank threats on the other team that already have MR. (If there isn't any MR yet, save this for item #3.)
* Morellonomicon: if there's a threat on the other team that relies on healing
* Liandry's: if they have tanks stacking HP
* Zhonya's: if they have assassin threats, especially if they're AD (e.g. Zed)
* Rabadan's: the optimal, absolutely most critical core item on Veigar -- get this if you're ahead after laning or if any of the threats listed above aren't too much of a concern.

Selling is probably the hardest part, since everyone will always tell you that it's gonna go up no matter what. Bad day? Buy the dip. Bad week? Buy the dip. Bad month? OVERSOLD BUY THE DIP.  

But a bad month starts with a bad day. For every fool who sold BTC at $500 and regrets it now, there's also a ""fool"" who sold LTC during a $300 dip, regretted it when LTC hit $375, and is now dancing with joy that LTC is like $150. Selling is a patience game.  

Recall, I cashed out the bulk of my stack back when BTC was ~$9k in early Feb. I didn't re-buy the dip @ $6k and I had people trashing me the entire time while BTC rose to $10k+ again that I was an idiot and should've held etc.  

[And then I bought more back in in early April, when BTC was $6k again.] (https://i.imgur.com/UrMcTDu.png)  

A merit of a good trade is often that you're wrong for a while before you're right. You sell and then just look at all the money that could've been on the table if you sold a day later. Or you buy and then watch your money get burned for a while and regret not buying later. Very rarely will you time the dip perfectly.  

I probably sound like an asshole saying that while posting a screenshot of myself limit-buying $5k in Eth @ $365 on Apr 6, a value so low that CMC doesn't even report Eth having that price that day and was like the **true bottom** of Eth's price curve. But  put yourself in my shoes: I bought Eth @ $380 a few days prior, and then set a buy order @ $365. To me, there was a very real possibility I was catching a falling sword. And it goes along with what I said. I was totally willing to watch my money burn to $350 or $300 since I believed it would go to a higher price in the future then $380, since I believed it was oversold.  

Moral of the story here is that it isn't always about 1-2 stop-losses either. Sometimes you buy based on recent trends, and other times you sell based on the fact that something is absurdly overbought.",1525132900

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Currently occupying Japan and SK? Are you out of your mind?

We have a fuck ton of troops in both countries, and the entire area is crawling with the US Navy. It doesn't look like a full scale occupation, and I'll grant you that in the current conditions that's a bit of an exaggeration, but neither country really gave legitimate consent to the troops. The old South Korean military dictators, that acted essentially as puppets did, and the Japanese leadership generally allows it, but there's a lot of bad history between the American military and the locals (involving no shortage of unpunished rapes), and there's no pretending that the US would leave even if SK or Japan requested it. Especially given the last part, occupation isn't too drastic of a word.

&gt; Do you not think NK deserved intervention?

I think they're pretty shitty, but we hardly came in like heroes in the Korean war when we burned villages to the ground and committed unspeakable atrocities, and backed the military dictatorship in the south, that most people conveniently forget ever existed.

&gt;Do you not think sanctions against them were appropriate? 

No, I do not think starving the ordinary people of North Korea is effective nor ethical.

&gt;You reply like I’m warmongering when the only claim I am making is that strong arming is necessary in cases like this.

You are in all odds not warmongering. Unless you part of the military industrial complex, federal government, or military command, you had zero say in any of America's interventions. You were not consulted, nor were you responsible. However, you ARE an apologist for imperialism and warmongers, that uses arguments alarmingly similar to the old racist colonialist ones.

And strong arming is not necessary, as strong arming is a really fucking dangerous game to play with a nuclear power.

&gt;There isn’t a passive solution that results in NK not continuing to systematically oppress its own people.

And no matter how many more North Korean civilians the US government decides to kill, this will not change. And the US is hardly some utopia of equality itself. 

&gt;As far as your overthrowing governments comment, I guess we should look away when governments murder their people in mass. It’s the US who is the monster!

My god do you CHOOSE to be this ignorant? It is the dictators that the US installs and props up that have murdered their people en masse! I suggest you read of the horrors the people of Chile, Guatemala, Iran, and half the god damned planet saw under the heel of brutal dictatorships put into power or propped up by the US.

There are many terrible governments in the world, that ought to be overthrown. Your mistake is assuming the US will liberate them, rather than back the current dictator or put a worse one into place.

First - if it's about money - obviously - starbucks is relatively cheap compared to Ruby Tuesdays.  If you have a couple of drinks, a dinner/meal for two at Ruby Tuesdays is going to easily run to $70-$80.  So it's not like it's a ""cheap"" option.  

Personally, I live in the suburbs.  We just don't have much in the way of ""hole in the wall restaurants"" or nice restaurants on the level of a chain/above it.  (without being upscale).  And I'm not really looking to drop ~$200 for a M&amp;G.  But we have lots of chains.  Longhorn. Texas Roadhouse.  Outback.  Ruby Tuesdays.  Fridays.  Applebees.  And the list goes on.  Unless you want to drive 45 minutes.  

I don't really see the issue with it myself.  

I happen to have a Ruby Tuesdays in walking distance to my place. I did end up doing one M&amp;G there.  I asked her what she was thinking... she suggested a casual place to grab a bite to eat, and have a cocktail.  Ruby Tuesday covered both of those.  ",1525132904

"cancer","t5_2qixx","I was diagnosed with stage 3a non-small cell lung cancer in April, 2013, and then re-staged to stage 4 in June, 2014. I have had surgery (lobectomy, upper left), chemo x2, and radiation x2. I have also done LOTS of alternative/complimentary therapies. I have scanned tumor-free since the summer of 2015 and my life is slowly getting back to normal. Please note that I won't say that I am ""cancer free"" until a doctor says that I am. I will say that I have scanned ""tumor free"" for almost 3 years, because that's a fact.
 
I changed my lifestyle and diet tremendously after I was diagnosed and I like to believe that that has contributed a lot to my current good health. I quit smoking and didn't drink for 3 years (I now enjoy some alcohol, but a fraction of what I enjoyed before). I drink WAY more water than I used to. I exercise much more than I used to. I was on a raw vegan diet for well over a year, then vegetarian, and now eat a little meat (maybe once a week). I eat/drink almost no dairy products (I miss cheese the most!). I eat virtually nothing sweet. I stayed away from a lot of carbs and quit eating bread, pasta, starchy veggies for over 3 years. I still eat very little bread and pasta and cereals. I really don't know if all this contributed to my living this long, but I actually feel healthier now than I did before I got cancer! 
 
I believe that I had several other things in my favor that contributed to me living this long: I was relatively young when diagnosed (53), I was in decent shape and not over weight when diagnosed, I'm married and my spouse made it a full time job to get me healthy and manage my health (I know I would have died by now if I was single; when I was told that I was terminal and had 6 months to live my wife also became a cheerleader and kept me focused when I thought that all was lost). And, I was fortunate enough to have the financial resources to be able to concentrate on my health and not work.
 
I also did (and continue to do) lots of alternative/complimentary therapies, but there is obviously no way to tell if any of these helped me. I did the ""shotgun"" approach and hoped that something may work. My oncologist told me that all of her patients that did alternative/complimentary therapies in addition to conventional therapies seemed to do better. Even if this benefit is purely psychological, I think it's still a benefit.
 
Please note that I told my oncologist everything I did, including diet changes, exercise routines, and alternative/complimentary therapies.

The last decent small shop in the Greater Bay Area is Demo Sport in San Rafael. Unfortunately most of them went under or moved in the past 10 years. A shame because there used to be some good ones.

Sports Basement is typically your best bet. Unfortunately they had a MASSIVE sale when the Tahoe season was looking like a bust after a bad January and February, so they're pretty much sold through their stock. Might be able to find boots at least.

Any Mountains are ok. 

REIs are generally not very good for snow unless you get closer to the mountains, the Bay Area locations dialed back their snowboard stock quite a bit.

If you can make it out further from the Bay, my favorite shop is Tahoe Sports Hub in Truckee. Also solid are Milo Sports in Auburn. 

And there's the Burton store in the Haight, which is ok. They're quality but their retail shops are meh, and they're priced higher than comparable equivalents from other companies. For example the Custom is a $600 board, that's probably a $500-550 board from another company. Discounts are also capped at about 30% off retail (at least previous year stuff).",1525132906

If you want to get nitty gritty, take a wireshark capture and see your meterpreter shell come back. There might be something obvious you can glean from the pcap.

Although it’s probably not the problem, try a different port too, just in case. I don’t think the meterpreter payload would even work if the port was the issue, but maybe there is a firewall rule that’s not blocking the whole shell, but just a part of it.

"MoviePassClub","t5_3nq3m","I agree.  If people starting buying ticket to one movie and going to another theaters will really start to dislike moviepass which is why that behavior needs to be discouraged but there will always be some who feel they are entitled to break the rules. 

We've already seen some theaters mark MP tickets for refund purposes.  If this becomes a problem I can see them starting to keep a closer eye on MP users.  Often people who think they are being sneaky are not being as sneaky as they think.  

If somebody breaks theater rules, that is their fault and not MPs fault even if they are doing it because they are upset at MP.  If they get caught ""but moviepass stopped repeat viewings"" won't prevent them from being kicked out and I hope they do.  ",1525132907

"Shitstatistssay","t5_2u3ds","I believe the average joe is a sheeple, and that is the nice way to say it, and because of this manipulative people that are power-hungry can, and will use them to get more powerful, and I have no trust in the masses preventing this from happening, so even if you are a ""good guy"" you need to use sheep in order to gain power, and this power is money to build a strong military to fight the ""Bad guys"" because the bad guys will use slaves to make their militaries powerful, and unless the good guys use slaves too the bad guys will literally fuck everyone because they had more, and better trained troops. I view that as horrible, and wish that not to happen, so morally it is needed/justified to tax people with the threat of violence for the greater good.

I view war as realistically inevitable despite what other people think, so I come from a militaristic viewpoint because without defending yourself from an invasion it doesn't matter what ISM you believe in because you are died. 

I think the only way to prevent this is to have the masses voluntarily donate to the military consistently, and generously otherwise the other statist countries will beat your military budget because they tax their people through a monopoly on violence, and they will have a crap ton more money than you, and they will invade you in the future.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I think you nailed it.   Why in the world did the Ford Foundation fund Sally Miller Gearhart, a certifiable nutjob who advocated reducing males to ten percent of the population?   

Americans have a tendency to yell ""conspiracy theory"" whenever anyone suggests that ruling elites may be working toward some goal or just protecting their class interests, which is peculiar considering that everyone does it.   The term conspiracy theory is even used when the ""conspiracy"" is legal and all right out in the open.   Michael Parenti wrote a good article about this: 

&gt;Often the term “conspiracy” is applied dismissively whenever one suggests that people who occupy positions of political and economic power are consciously dedicated to advancing their elite interests. Even when they openly profess their designs, there are those who deny that intent is involved. 

&gt;In 1994, the officers of the Federal Reserve announced they would pursue monetary policies designed to maintain a high level of unemployment in order to safeguard against “overheating” the economy...When an acquaintance of mine mentioned this to friends, he was greeted skeptically, “Do you think the Fed bankers are deliberately trying to keep people unemployed?” In fact, not only did he think it, it was announced on the financial pages of the press. Still, his friends assumed he was imagining a conspiracy because he ascribed self-interested collusion to powerful people. ",1525132907

No life nodes taken either, you generally want at least 150% increased life though I find higher is better as a melee character. Defenses end up not working as great from really large hits. So you also need a good portion of life to make up for where your defenses fail.

That's probably the biggest issue too, you have all the shield and defense nodes, but no life to deal with what actually gets by those defenses.


It's up to you to decide what to do, but... I won't be actively playing for a bit, but I can leave 30-40 orbs of regrets with a friend if you wanted to grab them and change your tree around.

Offered for sale/trade is an Omega Constellation Chronometer '95 two tone. It is the solid gold full bar version, 18K bezel and links. Cream linen dial, 18k applied indices/date window with applied 18k logo and star. 36mm case. I have the manual and four extra bracelet links. Bracelet has scratching but nothing deep. It shows signs of use, but can be returned to factory without issue. I had my jeweler look at it to confirm nothing was too deep to be removed. I will have them refresh the bracelet for you if you would like but it will take two weeks as they need to do each link by hand.

Sale Price/Trade Value of $1500

Doing the blood work would be great if you can afford it. It gives you a baseline for when hes older and lets the Dr know if hes a good candidate for anesthesia. A dental cleaning at 7 years old on a dog with no history of tooth brushing or preciously dental care is necessary. ESPECIALLY with small breeds. I would not be shocked to find your dog needs to have some teeth pulled which can't be done awake. Also with out X rays they can't 100% tell if the tooth needs to be pulled or that they got 100% of the root and did not leave any behind. The fact that you mentioned over kill for such a small dog is kinda comical to me because small dogs have the worse mouth/ dental disease of all and its needed more than in large breeds. You def want to have this dental done before he gets to be 9/10 years old and be more concerned about an anesthesia risk. With that being said we still routinely put  animals upwards of 10 years old under anesthesia.",1525132912

"airpods","t5_3a5ww","I’ve had mine for about 4 months give or take so I won’t mention anything about longevity but I use mine probably 6 hours a day with about 1.5 being on the phone and would never make it an entire day without the case but this is a non issue because the case is always in my pocket.They last far less time on the phone. I think the 2 rated hours is pretty accurate but mine are almost never at 100% when I start a phone call. Usually I only use one at a time and they charge faster than they discharge so I’ve never been caught without them or even really been bothered by them not lasting super long on the phone. 

The case also charges quite fast and I tend to plug that in every couple of days or just while on a quick car ride just out of habit and rarely because it’s actually dead. 

With the case/charger being always in my pocket it isn’t super common for me to run out of battery when I’m listening to music throughout the day but I do try and get equal use out of left and right and switch between the two. I feel out of the loop if I leave both while at work. 

Due to using them one at a time a lot I was worried about one battery wearing faster than the other but I haven’t noticed anything yet. 

My biggest gripe is the switching back and forth with my phone and Apple Watch. I honestly haven’t figured out if it’s a phone, watch, or airpods issue but quite often the airpods will get stuck in limbo and won’t connect to the Apple Watch. Almost always they reconnect to the phone but I have a few playlists (workout mostly” on my watch that I don’t leave on my phone since  it’s not with me on a run. If I happen to want to play one of those songs and my phone is in Bluetooth range it’s about a 25% success rate of actually being able to listen to them without manually pairing them the the watch.

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","Different speakers have different sensitivities/efficiencies.

This is a great explanation of the differences/similarities that you might find useful. Note: SPL (sound pressure level) is expressed in decibels (dB's).

&gt;Well, my answer is a little bit different - so I guess you get to take your pick!

&gt;Unfortunately the relevant terms get used inconsistently or imprecisely, leading many people to think that efficiency and sensitivity are the same thing.

&gt;Here is the convention that I follow. Some manufacturers also follow this, but not all.

&gt;As commonly used in consumer audio, ""efficiency"" is the 1 meter on-axis broadband anechoic SPL that a speaker delivers with a 1 watt input. Some manufacturers use a non-anechoic measurement (including room contribution), and some use a peak somewhere in the response curve instead of using a broadband average - so comparing two manufacturer's numbers may not really be apples-to-apples.

&gt;""Sensitivity"" is the 1 meter SPL the speaker delivers from a 2.83 volt input. Sometimes called ""voltage sentitivity"" to make that clear. The same opportunities for optimistic specs enter the picture - namely, using non-anechoic conditions and/or taking the measurement at a peak rather than using a broadband average.

&gt;So, to recap: Efficiency is related to Watts, and Sensitivity is related to Volts.

&gt;(Some manufacturers use these terms interchangeably or backwards from this convention, so it's up to you to read carefully and figure out what they're really saying. Look and see whether they are talking about 1 watt input, or 2.83 volts input.)

&gt;Now, here is how the two are related: 2.83 volts into 8 ohms is one watt; 2.83 volts into 4 ohms is 2 watts; and 2.83 volts into 16 ohms is one-half watt.

&gt;So if you have a 4-ohm, 91-dB/2.83 volt sensitive speaker, it's an 88-dB/1 watt efficient speaker. If you have a 16-ohm, 85 dB/2.83 volt speaker, it is also an 88 dB/1 watt efficient speaker. I prefer to convert back to watts, because you can usually figure out the amplifier's maximum wattage output into a given load more easily than you can figure out its maximum voltage output (which may or may not vary with load, depending on the amplifier), and because if you are interested in power handling then you want to know the wattage going into the speaker.

&gt;Hope this helps.

So I attended. We ended up moving to Utah last year, and the Temple Endowment (How it used to be) shattered what was left of my shelf.

I am 36 - and no longer a member of TSCC. Sure to keep the piece with the family or maybe to hedge my bets, my name was never removed. I no longer consider myself to be a member. 

- Life to this point has been interesting because I too slept with countless woman before I was married and at one point in time talked to a Bishop and had to talk to a Stake President.

I repented, and attended a Singles Branch for awhile.

One night in the waiting annex adjacent to the temple I asked out someone from said Branch, and she replied: ""I don't date men like you.""

Started with roasting 4 cans of San Marzano tomatoes in my cast iron dutch over for an hour in a 350 degree over.  I also had 4 red bell peppers, and 5 habenros roasting in there for about 30 minutes.  Sweated, peeled, and rough chopped the peppers, and added them to the tomatoes.  Then 3 large cans of tomate juice and 6 chicken bullion cubes went into the soup pot on high heat.  I added 1 and 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream to the tomatoes/peppers and hit with the stick blender until smooth.  Added the blended mix to the tomato juice, and added a very healthy dose of basil and oregano.  Let it come to a simmer, killed the heat, and let it set for an hour or so.  ",1525132919

"autechre","t5_2w6c1","Beyond the top 5, things are generally pretty messy, but this is how I currently feel.

1. NTS Sessions 1-4
2. elseq 1–5
3. Quaristice (Versions) / Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae / Quaristice
4. Exai / L-event
5. Move of Ten / Oversteps

Coincidentally, I don't know of any other artist/group I listen to with all 5 of their most recent studio albums in my top 5 favorites from them. Æ just continue to evolve so much.

**Edit:** I also will concede that I haven't spent nearly enough time with NTS Sessions 1-4 yet. Regardless, it's currently my favorite, and likely will be for a long time. It's like they decided they needed a Greatest Hits compilation, so they just made new material that contains the best aspects of everything they've ever done, then released that instead.

elseq 1–5 came close to this level of greatness, but somehow the NTS Sessions (despite being twice as long) feel more focused. Even when they're retreading the same territory as some of the elseq material, the new tracks feel like they have more depth to them, and the greater lengths give them even more time to expand and morph over time to reveal underlying subtleties that might have otherwise been buried. All of the tracks on the NTS Sessions could have been easily cut down to 4-6 minutes, and they would have been fantastic, but instead, we got the exploded diagrams of those songs with all the details laid bare and given their own time in the spotlight.

The previously massive amount of material we got during the Quaristice era was a sort of ""proof of concept"" of this idea; that the same parameters that were used to make one of the album's tracks could be tweaked slightly, and made into a totally new creation that is still rooted somewhere in the original. My biggest issue with Exai is that they didn't take the same approach, though we've been seeing bits of those tracks popping up occasionally in newer material.",1525132919

Then some asshole moves next door and they hire some unlicensed tree guy to ""trim"" it back....not realizing that removing established limbs will effectively kill the plant if you remove too much (removing new, green growth won't hurt it, and usually it is done by breaking the limbs with your hand, as trimming it will cause the leaves/needles to turn brown). 

Some trees can be cut back to practically to the stump and they'll be just fine, but pines are a different story. They only grow up and out.

There were many conflicting and confounding variables in the dynamics surrounding political party support in the south. There are some theories, some of which are backed by evidence. To assume there is some objective factual narrative about what actually happened and why is oversimplifying the entire issue.

"ehlersdanlos","t5_2spw0","When I was young I had issues with numerous things. Instability of my joints, particularly my hands and hips; had allergic reactions to random medications to the point where it actually made me somewhat phobic of medications up until more recently (I still have issues with taking my medication partly due to this and also partly because of trauma related stuff), adhesives, smoke, etc.; I had troubles with walking and also with chewing food. I was (and still am) a massively ""picky"" eater because a lot of different food types caused me issues (diarrhoea, constipation, stomach pain, etc.), blah blah. There were a lot of issues. I was a late walker and premature, I also had breathing problems which I think was related to both my asthma and my pectus evacuatum (despite it being pretty mild it seemed to cause a lot of issues!). I was also ill a lot more than most other kids, but I still had to go to school because otherwise it meant staying at home with my abusive dad.

Things were pretty much the same symptom wise when I was a teen, just pain, fatigue and brain fog were worse - joints also subluxated/dislocated more. I also started having more POTS related symptoms but never had this checked out (my cardiologist thinks it's this, I'm just waiting for a tilt test now). My diagnosis story is a bit all over the shop because my dad severely limited medical involvement because he's an abusive moron. This also led me to being self-neglecting so I basically stopped talking about issues when I was very young as it'd frustrate him. I got diagnosed with EDS at 17/18, though, as I couldn't write for my exams and my hypermobility was further investigated.

At university I got worse physically and mentally, especially between years 2 and 3 of my degree, for various reasons (my mum got cancer, one of my best friends killed themselves, etc. - the stress/upset made me spiral mentally and physically, and I've never really recovered), but I still graduated (2016, got a First Class degree somehow despite almost dropping out*). I pretty much just worked and worked, probably so I could avoid everything else, at great cost and I'm still paying for it. 

I'm currently unable to work and am on Employment and Support Allowance, an out-of-work benefit in the UK for people too sick/disabled to work. I got put into the support group on my first try in 2017 (the group where they basically don't think you'll recover) and also didn't have to wait long which is virtually unheard of (most people wait close to a year or more, I was seen and awarded in less than 4 months!). This whole thing is depressing if I'm honest, which probably doesn't help my mental health issues. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. 

At the moment there are a lot of mental health issues that I'm trying to figure out (the complex PTSD, depression/anxiety, and an eating disorder**), GI trouble (nausea, physical pain when eating, having a limited number of foods that my body doesn't have issues with, swallowing issues, etc.) and cardiology stuff (what could be POTS, although I know this is technically a dysautonomia, not a cardiac issue!). I'm also waiting to see a neurologist and a neuro-opthamologist for my various neurological issues (diagonal diplopia, vertigo, fainting, breathing issues, severe headaches that originate from the base of my skull [feels like a pick axe driving into the back of my head], fluctuating ability to focus my vision, balance problems, etc.). I'm also trying to figure out how to manage my pain which is problematic because a lot of things I react to (still not sure what this is, but it has been suggested that it could be MCAS) and I don't want to try really strong stuff currently either because they cause their own issues and I'm only 24. Regarding my being ill a lot as a child, that hasn't really changed, I tend to have back to back infections still. Actually doing something about medical issues is a massive step for me because I'm so used to sweeping everything under the rug, just wish I'd done it sooner, then maybe things wouldn't be so shit now. 

*I had a lot of help at university because of my disabilities and MH issues, without having a disability support worker and mental health mentor, and being constantly encouraged my lecturers and other staff members I definitely wouldn't have passed. The other adjustments I had were important too (e.g. equipment, different exam arrangements, etc.). 

** Obviously eating disorder management is tricky for me; the GI issues, which were preexisting, definitely didn't help with my ED development! But also an ED can cause other things to be worse (e.g. poor immunity, etc.). I'm hoping when I'm managing the ED and GI issues better things will improve, but getting the help is proving difficult.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","Is it?

Buddy if people's allegiances as fans came down to quality on the pitch MLS crowds would be two dudes waiting around for the next NFL game, it just is simply inferior to other soccer out there. 

People are fans of soccer teams because they identify with a team and become woven into its narrative. At the outset I think York 9 has an uphill battle, but over time I think plenty of the 1.1 million inhabitants of York will become fans of the York 9 as long as it is presented professionally and with polish...

A soccer specific stadium is a key step towards being a polished team. Something some MLS teams haven't even done.",1525132921

They're response was opening a case against me for lack of payment 😔. 

Not wanting an issue- I paid the $7.50 for it. The seller sent pics of the bottom of the pop and I was then 90% sure I had purchased a fake. I don't know if I would necessarily care that it's a fake if it was a particularly good one but the head is way off-center. Looks like it might be a Frankenstein job

"DeadlyPremonition","t5_2soz0","York/Zach loses something if you make it a TV series rather than a game; there wouldn't be the meta-textual reading that comes with the interactivity, with Zach acting as this persona that the audience can adopt to interact with Greenvale and essentially become part of the narrative. 

You could probably still pull it off somehow, but I think it might come across a bit too much like Mr. Robot, in which the main character addresses us like his imaginary friend. Funnily enough Deadly Premonition and Mr. Robot both have a very similar twist (At the end of the game and the first season respectively) straight out of Fight Club, although I think Deadly Premonition executes the Fight Club twist a lot better, probably because it's an actual protagonist switch/takeover in which reality changes, and it's a reverse Fight Club; York is not anarchistic/malicious like Tyler Durden/Mr. Robot, and he's giving control back to Zach, not away from him.

I also don't think Roaming Sigourney would translate too well, given that her side missions are all pretty much just York driving her home; you'd have to completely change it or relegate her to a background character who York doesn't interact with much at all. I feel like most of the characters have had too much thought put into them to cut them or use reductive versions of them.

Also I think the majority of the other world sections from the game could be cut for a TV series; make it so that there's less distinction between the real world and and the nightmarish fantasy world. That way we can make sense of things like the Raincoat killer's appearances in the Other world and the crazy boss battles without having to have whole episodes where York is fighting repetitive hoards of shadows.

Another issue is that if Deadly Premonition became a TV series then David Lynch would potentially file a lawsuit for infringement of copyright. Infact screw that: He'd definitely sue. As a game you can probably get away with copying Twin Peaks elements...In a TV series (The same medium) you're under much more scrutiny.",1525132921

For the next 30 days, Postie Pete will be delivering a parcel straight to your inventory, ranging in size from small to huge. The bigger the parcel, the greater your reward!

These are gifts from the characters of Gielinor, from a shopkeeper to maybe even the Wise Old Man himself as a thank you for your hard work. Check the Parcel Rewards section for ideas of what you could win, including Postie Pete's own hat or even a ring to transform you into one of the Barrows brothers!

In addition, you can go about your daily XP hunt and find more parcels while doing so. As with your daily gift, these can come in bigger sizes with greater rewards. On opening each parcel, you will get a postage stamp, and ten of these can be exchanged with Postie Pete in Burthorpe for yet more parcels.

Not enough? Adventurers are always losing things, and Postie Pete has packages of lost property boxed up. After Postie Pete has delivered 5, 10, 15 or 20 parcels to you, you'll be able to claim the property.

Not able to log in from the 1st of May? Don’t worry, you won’t lose out: your 30 days of parcels starts from the first day you log in over May. So, if you’re on holiday or have exams to revise for, you won’t be missing any daily parcels.

Here's just some of the rewards you could get from Parcels:

- Parcel Pete pet
- Postie's Pete hat
- Swag Bag
- 250m or 500m Coins
- Barrows rings of transmog

#Lost Property
Adventurers are always losing things, and Postie Pete has packages of lost property boxed up ready to be claimed. After Postie Pete has delivered numerous parcels to you during his delivery period, here's just some of the stuff you could get from his post office:

- Aura Refreshes
- Sign of life resets
- A bag of Invention components
- Instakill Darts
- ""Postie"" title

**Note: You’ll have access to the post office until the end of June, at which point all mail items will be removed so make sure to finish using them all before then.**

I agree that we shouldn’t pretend that obesity is something to aspire too, but you can’t assume health purely based upon physical appearance. You don’t know what they’re doing or working on. That’s for them and their doctor.

Also, the idea that attraction is biological and not social is ridiculous.

If you’re gonna throw at somebody I think it needs to be the guy not throwing 96+ with movement and no good grasp on where his ball is going. It should never be at the head and tbh it shouldn’t be around the hands/wrist. And you only get one chance to make it happen. Hit a guy in the back/butt/thigh and keep it pushing. Point made. If you miss it’s either way inside or it’s behind him.

I have snow tires and suddenly my car has appropriate traction for the conditions. Which means reasonable acceleration/deceleration rates are handled well in all but the most sever (black ice) conditions. Recovering from a loss of traction from small patches of ice is dramatically improved as well.

I have a 4x4 dodge with snow tires and I have a passat with snow tires. It's absolutely worth the investment. I routinely drive my passat in conditions that I've seen vehicles flipped in. Consistently, I can stop, turn and accelerate where other vehicles are spinning their wheels (including awd). 

Modern vehicles are incentivized to have high epa MPG numbers. Part of this involved ""all-season"" economy tires that do not handle cold wet weather well at all.

America has this attitude of trivializing the importance of winter tires and I don't get it. [Many other countries mandate their use.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_tire#Regulations) 

I get pretty annoyed by the advice of ""Always drive like you have slicks on"" because I would never drive with slicks on. I have my family in the car and I love them. Spending the money on proper safety equipment has always been a priority of mine. If you zoom in on the front tires of the vehicle in this post you can literally not see any tread definition in the tire and this person won the stupid prize of playing stupid games. What's worse is how quickly this could have ruined someone else's life.

Response: This is a blatant mischaracterization of the situation. the IOTA Foundation does not have any technical means to access funds apart from the full cooperation of the community and the node operators

2. DCI Claimed:  “Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in IOTA.” In the report, DCI revealed practical collisions in the Curl-P hashing function. (Sep 8, 2017)

Response: However, what [DCI] failed to either understand, or deliberately did not disclose, even after being informed of this fact many times, is that the Curl-P function is not a cryptographic function nor was it intended to be.  IOTA is unaffected by collisions in Curl-P

Note: Curl-P has been removed 9 months ago anyway. It is currently being audited and peer-reviewed, and has yet to be decided whether it will return

3. TNW article questioning the relationship between IOTA and Microsoft (December 16, 2017)

Response: To be absolutely clear: at no point was a formal corporate partnership implied either directly or indirectly in any post, statement, or press release issued by the IOTA Foundation.

"quityourbullshit","t5_2y8xf","&gt;So please do tell me what causes Autism?

Not vaccinations. Autism naturally develops in an infants second year, most often between 12 and 18 months of age, due to issues with brain growth. These issues are DNA based and NOT caused by externalities (external elements to the child's development) such as vaccines. The infants are born with the DNA problems that will eventually lead to autism. This is also not applicable to all cases, as some children develop autism at even later stages of growth, though very rarely much later.

[Source](https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/faq)

&gt;Is it not possible that all the heavy metals in the overzealous use of vaccines for profit cause autism

Lets take this one in sections:

&gt;heavy metals

I assume you mean the use of alluminum etc in vaccines. These metals are never present in high enough quantities to harm humans, even when multiple injections are present, unless the child was being injected with a literal gallon of vaccines in one sitting. I implore you to read into the issue from trustworthy sources. Google Scholar is a great aay to find scientific articles with all sourcss sitied that address this issue, or sciencemag.org which is a great source.

[Check this out for some basic information](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/four-vaccine-myths-and-where-they-came)

&gt;overzealous use of vaccines for profit

Vaccines are actually not that profitable, if at all. Many are even made at a loss or just break even. Take flu vaccines for example. They are often distributed for free as they cost nearly nothing to make. 

Vaccines as an industry make a small amount of profit, but overall the industry profits very little, so no profit is not a driving factor

[Source](http://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/immunization/childhood-vaccinations-its-not-about-manufacturer-profit)

&gt;and posts like this are meant to confuse the population, and may actually be paid-for and placed by the pharma companies that produce the vaccines to the tune of billions?

Once again, these companies make nothing or small profits off vaccines, nowhere near billions of dollars. In fact, even millions of dollars would be misleading. As for big pharma spresding misinformation, that is plausible for products that actually make money (like opioids, which addict people and create a product with little elasticity in the market) but not really for vaccines, which often make nothing or barely anything. This is just simple paranoia

Also, spreading such misinformation may have legal implications and for unprofitable things like vaccines, its simply not worth getting into.

Once again, look at scholarly articles to learn about this. scholar.google.com ",1525132930

This is because FATE needs to stick to a certain type of play. It needs to decide if it’s an action-oriented or social-oriented game. The mechanics are too barebones, and too easily exploitable or imbalancable. I consider crippling depression a major character flaw, and something like selfishness to be a minor character flaw, while someone else might consider selfishness a major character flaw and a character with crippling depression unplayable.

The mechanics leave a basic, generic nothing where players never have to think to solve problems. The only concrete mechanic are Skills, which leaves practically nothing for character customization. 

A system that works way better is Open Legend. It can be narrative oriented, but has just enough customization options that every character really feels unique and conflict has actual tension behind it.

Another bad thing about FATE is that they take a DND-amount of pages to describe their barebones rules system. Learn to be concise.",1525132931

"GalaxyS9","t5_2wmhk","I switched from iphone 6S to Galaxy S9\+. Hear me out. I can't say that I regret my decision, however I am not quite happy with it either I was just expecting something better. Little things that bothers me came out really quickly.

The bad parts :

\- The 1st thing I immediately noticed is the touch screen which is by no means close to iphones. It doesn't feel so smooth and natural, but you'll get used to it.

\- The handling of the phone is also not very user friendly, but maybe that's just me and the transition of using 8 years iphones. For example I am missing the mute button which I had on my 6S on the left side. Here you need to bring down the volume manually by holding the minus volume or unlock your phone, bring up the quick menu and tap twice the volume control to mute the phone completely.

\- As an everyday instagram user the pictures in my feed are absolute not sharp and looks like garbage quality, after i click on a picture to enlarge it it takes about a second to sharpen up. This bothers me a lot. My girlfriend has the same on her Note 8 and some of my friends as well, but on different android phones. I guess that this is just instagram compatibility with android because I never had this on my iphone.

\- They claim that the battery is big and long lasting, however I can't go a half day without charging my phone. I am listening to music all the time and occasionally play some Hearthstone or watch some youtube videos as well. From a brand new phone with 3500 mah battery I expected a lot more.

\- The keyboard is complete garbage, I couldn't type a sentence without an error even after a week. I downloaded gboard app based on my friend recommendation who is a big android fan. It is much better with it but still not there. The emojis are also out of place and not so easy to type them like on the iphone where I had everything just once click away.

\- It is not a stylish phone with which you can show off in public like with an apple logo phone and be a hipster and a cool kid. Nobody cares about S9\+ even tho if it's the best Samsung on the market and a pretty expensive phone overall. The build quality also feels kinda cheap, especially the back. Fingerprints are all over the place so I recommend a case for sure.

\- The S9\+ is not as big as I expected. I am using it with one hand without any issues. Of course it is much bigger than my old 6S but I really wanted a new phone and I wanted a big one with a huge display. This is one, but could be bigger for my taste.

\- No weather app and a pretty shitty notepad. You will need to download them and a lot more things to actually get your phone going. The stock weather app pre\-installed is not accurate and it is ugly. I never used a weather app on iphone expected the one built in.

\- The standard google navigation and the visuals are just bad. I had a much more pleasing visual built in navigation in my iphone and I never changed it in my life. I am driving a lot and this is crucial to me. I am yet to find a good and visually appealing navigation app for the S9\+.

\- The screen is AMOLED. I never had this so I didn't know what to expect, but whatever. I would chose the retine over this anytime. The corners and the edges on my S9\+ are weirdly lit and sometimes I can see a blueish greenish color which has nothing to do there. But according to many posts, forums etc. this is normal when using Amoled, so I don't know....

\- You can't read notifications on a locked screen. So when I am on my PC \( working, gaming whatever \) and someone messages me on whatsapp or instagram, I need to wake up the phone \( not unlocking it \) so the black screen with the clock and DTM goes away. Then I can see and read the messages. On the locked screen you see only small app icons showing you which app has a notification for you. But you are not able to see nor read the message.

\- When I am listening to music on Soundcloud \( everyday \) and I close all my apps running in the background, the music keeps playing. So I am not sure how, but this is happening all the time. I need to open the app and pause the music. It acts like I never closed it.... because of this, I do not trust my S9\+ and I don't know whether I really closed all my apps or something is still running in the background.

\- You can actually get viruses here like on the PC. So here you need to think twice before start googling for some pornsites. With ios you don't need to face this concern.

\- The fingerprint location on the back even if redesigned and moved elsewhere as on the previous Samsung , it is still not so convenient to use and unlock your phone. Our home button was simply better placed and the response was quicker.

\- The slow mo feature everyone is excited about is not really working for me. I either can't use it correctly \( yes tried the lighter \) or it is just not working as I seen in videos. The slow mos I captured were nowhere where I wanted them to be. The results were never good or spectacular.

Now the good parts :

\- The screen is quite big, it covers almost the entire front panel so you can really enjoy watching photos, netflix, playing games whatever. IT is really enjoyable.

\- As a photographer I am very happy with the dual lenses especially with the f/1.5 aperture. In pro mode I can manually set up my camera and shoot how I want. I really appreciate that I no longer need to bring everywhere my heavy canon with an even heavier lens. Photos shot during the night are however not so great as advertised and I had some issues with the focus and the sharpening here and there. But this is a much better camera than on the iphone. That is a completely garbage to nowadays standards.

\- The storage is 64GB for me, however I had the same in my iphone. This was full really quickly so I love the option to extend the memory with an SD card.

\- A headphone jack is a must for me as I have my headphone in my ears a few hours a day. Especially in my office when I am working. This is standard for me but nowadays this is luxury as many mobile phone manufacturers are removing the jack because it takes a lot of space and they want slim and light phones.

\- I like stock things and I don't really like to modify stuff, I usually buy stuff because they are good as they are built and manufactured. However, in this case the option to customize your phone comes really handy so this is an exception for me. And I am not talking about downloading and installing apps, but modifying and setting up your phone to your liking.  iphone is too controlled and it doesn't allow you to do things which your S9 will allow you to do. And you will appreciate this.

\- It has 6 gigs of RAM, and the performance is really good. Spec wise, this phone outshines the latest iphone by a lot and it is noticeable.

Nothing else comes to my mind as I have my phone for about a week, but I am yet to discover more good parts about this phone and hopefully not so many negative ones. Still getting used to it, the transition from iphone to android is a nightmare. The first three days, I wanted to return the phone or smash it against the wall. But once you get used to it this is a great phone with these specs and for what it offers. The price is also fair, not steep like iphone X , not cheap like a shitty phone, it simple costs what it costs. The phone will definitely last, but I am not sure for how long in my case. If I could go back in time with all this knowledge and user experience, I would probably keep my 6S until it falls apart and maybe wait half year or a little bit more and pick the new iphone which will be released after X. Or maybe S10\+. I don't know.

The case won't fit the S8 as the back of the S9 was redesigned due to complains from customers and user for the fingerprint sensor. It was moved to a different sport, therefore the case won't fit.

Difference between S9 and S9\+ is a larger screen, more RAM and dual lens and a bigger battery, so definitely go with the S9\+. I personally would not buy the S9.

If you manage to pick up the S9\+ and will consider a case and a protective screen glass, I spent about 2\-3 days researching what screen protector and case fits together, because you would be surprised, some cases are not compatible with the screen protector and will lift it off.

I ended up with the Whitestone dome glass and a Spigen Tough Armor Case. Fits perfectly. Installing the white dome was a bummer however and I ruined my 1st try. Thank god they offer a 2nd chance with the kit. This glass is however the best one I ever seen. The case is low build quality for the price, looks much better on the screen and in the videos.

Hope this helped.",1525132931

I like that motron solution - good find! Any decent rack mounted audio gear would be that expensive (or more), be harder to use, and contain many many features that you don't need. The motron is what I think you should get. If you plug that into your computers headphone jack you could get synced up audio today.

(And if it's for business, that sounds like a write off to me!)

And may I say, congratulations :)

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Yes! And I apologize for how non-sexy and medical this is going to sound. In general your goal is to make the angle between her cervix and vaginal canal level

-if you guys really like missionary, make sure her back is level with the bed and she’s nice and elongated. Alternatively, placing a bed pillow at her tailbone area can help her be nice and elongated and can reduce stress on the back. Avoid her coming up to kiss you in this position bc you want to avoid that “sit-up” position. Again, even this may not work

-she’s on her back, her legs are straight up. Bonus if she has straight legs and ankles are crossed: again her pelvis is straight here, and if she has this flexibility, the tension in her legs makes her feel tighter on you which is always nice. If easier (and depending on height), make sure she’s close to the edge  of the bed and you are off the bed. You’ll have more maneuverability and can aim a little bit to the side to hit the soft wall of her vagina and avoid the cervix

-countertops, tables, whatever works for YOUR height. If she’s laying flat and you are going in parallel  your chances are better

-doggy style as long as her back is level and you are going straight in

Again she might just be too shallow for you. But the cervical angle thing with missionary is so common I learned it in a medical class lol. So best of luck and try out some fun stuff!

"Braincels","t5_3pci5","&gt;i've had friendships fall into romance but maybe that's not as common a thing as i assumed. 

I mean, yea, it definitely happens and if it does, that's great. But it should be your default method of trying to find a partner. Your ""sample size"" is just too small.

&gt;i think i agree with the 'finding people you get along with' bit. it does make more sense to me to make your intentions clear from the beginning but i think the best relationships always have that undertone.

Well, yea, that I can't disagree with. I guess my point is that you should try to find someone who can be your romantic partner *and* your best friend. But if you want to find a partner, you shouldn't make a detour via friendship and maybe see where things go after several months but deliberately try to date people so you could ""screen"" maybe one a week or something? That way, you, at worst, maybe ""wasted"" an evening or two and not several months trying to become the person's friend.  
I think that's what many people get kinda wrong about dating and even **I** can see that. You don't try to find the right person to date, dating is the process of finding the right person...

&gt;i think your advice is sound though. are you really an incel haha?

Concentrate on building as much stuff as possible out of metal to start. Day 1, drop research bench, start on stonecutting.  Reserve wood for fires.

Make your furniture as comfortable as possible once you have some stone.  Don't be afraid to build 10 beds and pick the best 2-3 to keep.  Same with dining chairs and the chair in foront of your research station.

Double wall everything, keep it small, try to build up against rock if possible to save the effort of another wall. Airlock your exits with an extra door to keep heat in, it really helps.

1.  Using one and paying it off on time and in full every month is about the only way to build a good credit score without paying interest.  A good credit score will be useful if you ever want to get a mortgage, or even just rent an apartment.

2.  Some credit cards give you cash back or other benefits (rental car insurance for example) when you use them.

3.  Credit cards are slightly better protection against fraud or disputed claims than debit cards.

Credit cards also give you the ability to borrow money from them, but this is not usually a benefit, as the interest rates they charge are quite high.  However, in an absolute emergency, this could be a benefit.

BUT First! I want to introduce to you guys to some of my... I guess you can call them coworkers? 

1. This is Asagami Fujino, and she’s my girlfriend. We met a while back at work and kinda hit it off afterwards. She’s also legally blind, but that doesn’t stop her at all. Also, she can bend things with her mind. No, it’s not a magic trick - she’s broken enough bridges to prove otherwise. 

2. The girl that’s hiding away in the corner? That’s Osakabehime. My partner/charge back at work. She’s a very talented artist - it’s just that she doesn’t like people. Or the sun. Or table lights. I’ve been trying to get her to interact with people but it’s a slow process. A *very* slow one.

3. Last but no least - Lavinia, my adopted daughter. I found her in Salem, where she and her best friend Abigail were being trailed for something that they had no part in. Everything’s fine now - Abigail’s with us now! But I had to adopt her - she’s just too cute. And if someone who looks like a cross between an octopus and a plate of spaghetti left out in the sun for too long comes to you, tell him that he had one chance with my daughter and he blew it.

"AskEurope","t5_2uayg","For one, the assertion that the soviet Union was particularly progressive before Stalin is still ridiculous. For a brief period there, the Soviet Union had a very different economic system (NEP), and it's definitely clear that Lenin and Stalin had different ideas for the USSR's future, but Lenin's envisioned state was not a democracy by any stretch either.

As for the people's identification, the ""Soviet man"" was really pushed ideologically, but it didn't catch on particularly well. In the 70s, the concept had some acceptance as it was being pushed by the party, but still coexisted with the more traditional ethnicity system (or ""nationalities"" as they were called). So even people who identified with the Soviet nationality would also identify with their ""base"" nationality, and then the whole concept didn't really have time to develop because the Soviet Union didn't even last 20 years after ""the Soviet people"" became the official ideological concept. I think the best proof that such an identity never fully developed is that basically nobody identifies as ""Soviet"" now.

The more interesting, to me, part is that the amount of people identifying in part as Soviets skyrocketed in Russia in the 90s. An incredibly important, volatile and decisive decade in Russia.",1525132939

ontop of all of that, half way through it all we decided that the scenary needed to change so we went across a huge fucking ocean, beat the locals into a bloody pulp and started going at ourselves again.

Most democracies have always limited suffrage to a very small number of people, and elective monarchies were no different, but elective monarchies were a very common form of government for a very long time. Some were ""elective"" monarchies where the reality was that the royal house still controlled most of the wealth and armed forces with all the threat that implied, so the election wasn't exactly fair, mind. But in Europe at least, the idea that it should always pass down father to son only became properly entrenched as a universal thing in the middle ages.

Rome, for example, elected their kings until they became a republic. The Senate would choose one from amongst the rulers and noble families of Rome and neighbouring cities, and then the full people's assembly would be called to vote on it.

A whole shit-tonne of Greek cities had comparable systems, as did various tribes.

In Macedon and Epirus, the army itself would elect the king.

The Holy Roman Empire was an absolute clusterfuck of competing cities, kingdoms, duchies etc. all vying for power, with prince-electors often themselves being elected by the noble families of their own petty kingdoms.

agressive is actually spelled aggressive. You can remember it by two gs.

&gt; The Charles Koch Foundation had a say in hiring and firing professors at George Mason University, an agreement the university denied for years, according to documents released Monday and detailed in an Associated Press report.

&gt; Parsons now works for the activist group UnKoch My Campus, and she told the AP that the documents from George Mason are similar to agreements the Koch Foundation made with Florida State University.

&gt; The Koch Foundation said in a statement that the agreements with George Mason University are &amp;quot;Old and inactive&amp;quot; and that newer agreements contain no such provisions.

Okay, so let’s look at it this way: remember how in high school you had to plot functions on a Cartesian X/Y system. The function you’re plotting is in fact similar to a curve in a vector editor in that it represents a shape as a scalable formula.

Now let’s place a simple square grid on top of this system and the plotted curve whereby each square can be considered a pixel. Each square through which the graph runs may be considered an active pixel, and each square through which no part of the graph runs may be considered an inactive pixel.

When you resize your vector image, the graph will be replotted and other pixels will be active or inactive compared to the previous plot.

Your pixel-based display can render non-pixel data because it calculates which pixels intersect with the path of the function/vector curve.",1525132942

Instead, I have a few questions. 

What do you usually message women on dating apps as a conversation starter? 

Do you recognize if you have a specific type? Either looks or personality. 
If so, have you ever tried to match with women that are maybe a bit outside of that type? 

As for rejection.. Yeah, it sucks. You kind of just have to get used to it and learn to take it in stride. Better to try and get rejected, than to not try at all. 

I once started dating a guy off of an anonymous app. We talked for a few days before exchanging pictures. This ensured that we actually liked talking to each other, and that it wasn't just based on physical attraction. 

I've found that dating was much more free of pressure, once I stopped caring as much about looks. If someone is kind, caring and able to carry an intellectual conversation, looks just don't mean as much. That's not to say that looks don't have anything to say, as attraction is obviously necessary for a relationship. ",1525132943

2. Wording it the way you did makes it seem like he NEVER uses his money to help something...

""West, alongside his mother, founded the ""Kanye West Foundation"" in Chicago in 2003, tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates, while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education. In 2007, the West and the Foundation partnered with Strong American Schools as part of their ""Ed in '08"" campaign. As spokesman for the campaign, West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization, and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year.

In 2008, following the death of West's mother, the foundation was rechristened ""The Dr. Donda West Foundation."" The foundation ceased operations in 2011. Kanye West and friend, Rhymefest, also founded ""Donda's House, Inc"". Got Bars is the Donda's House signature music/lyric composition and performance program. Participants are selected through an application and audition process. Got Bars is a free music writing program with the goal of helping at-risk Chicago youth. It is aimed at students between 15 and 24, and includes lessons on how to write and record music. Their curriculum is based on the teaching philosophy and pedagogy of Dr. Donda West with a focus on collaborative and experiential learning.

West has additionally appeared and participated in many fundraisers, benefit concerts, and has done community work for Hurricane Katrina relief, the Kanye West Foundation, the Millions More Movement, 100 Black Men of America, a Live Earth concert benefit, World Water Day rally and march, Nike runs, a Hurricane Sandy benefit concert, and an MTV special helping young Iraq War veterans who struggle through debt and PTSD a second chance after returning home""

***

This would be easier if someone streamed/recorded the game so I could check when the messages were sent. Maybe the sequence of events as I remember it is incorrect, but I'll explain how I experienced the situation in any case. For anyone wondering, the half in question was [G1H2](https://tagpro.eu/?match=1854386).

***

So how I remember it was that the half started as usual, no issues during the countdown or anything, our offenders run off to the other team's base, while I'm trying to focus on not letting the other team grab and get out for the first few seconds. So after our offenders successfully grab and get out, I notice your message asking for a break - but not stating the reason, which I assumed was because you only just realised something was wrong, so didn't have time to explain it in your first message. 

I had remembered that Chuck had joined the group like a minute before we launched the half - after asking if your team was ready and everything. My natural reaction was to think that you actually wanted Chuck in, but somehow forgot to get him in, and that was the reason you wanted a break. Since I thought that was the reason, and I had made sure to ask if your team was ready, I thought it was reasonable to play on. Do bear in mind that this whole thought process only lasted a couple of seconds.

At this point our FC was coming into base, you had asked for a break, which I mistakenly thought was because you didn't have the correct lineup. Our FC capped, and a little while after that I saw your second message, where you said you were having problems with your headset. (Again, I don't know exactly when you sent it because there's no footage I can verify it with, so I can only speak for when I noticed your messages. I do believe what you're saying and I can definitely see how it seemed like I was intentionally ignoring you, and taking advantage of the situation). It might very well be the case that I was too focused on the game to realise when your messages were actually sent.

Then I obviously realised that I was mistaken about the reason you wanted a break, but we had already capped when I realised that. We had waited 10 mins to start the first half, so I was already annoyed because I just wanted to get this half underway, had made sure your team was ready, launched and started playing, and then - after we had capped - realised you had a fairly legit reason for asking to go b2g, such as realising something was wrong with your headset. So in the heat of the moment I just kept playing, which might be affected by the fact that I've personally been fucked over multiple times over the seasons because of the no-breaks rule - clearly not a valid excuse though. It 100% would've been the right call to go back to group even if the message explaining why was sent after we had capped. Somehow that didn't occur to me at the time, despite it being so glaringly obvious now.

***

In hindsight I can definitely see that it doesn't look good, and that I should've gone back to group, so I'll apologise for that. Luckily you were far better and more disciplined than us in that half even with the shakey start, and still beat us. I do understand your frustration, and I'm sorry that this silly situation arose. Hopefully you can forgive me; there really wasn't any ill intention behind it, but rather a series of hasty assumptions and dumb mistakes, which I certainly regret now.

***

**Edit:** Downvoting someone explaining a situation where they thought they were right at the time, but later realising they likely weren't, and apologising for doing so, at 2am - instead of just going to bed and ignoring it.

Koln(Germany) being relegated after playing Europa league and bundesliga leading to a horrible start to the season), hell even in liga mx we saw Chivas who were starting to have a decent run of games like a month and a half ago to the point where we could see a decent chance for a liguilla spot get ruined because of CCL tie ins leading to injuries, eventually with Chivas having a bad April in the league due to lack of depth.

From the sound of it, this 'we're acting like we hate each other' bit is something Supermega likes to do so maybe Arin and Dan wanted to give it a shot because they saw it and thought it was really funny.

"Animesuggest","t5_2ssl0","The leanest route (anime):

1. {Dragon Ball}
1. {Dragon Ball Kai} (all parts--MAL breaks this into 2 series and an OVA)
1. {Dragon Ball: Ossu! Kaettekita Son Gokuu to Nakama-tachi!!}
1. {Dragon Ball Super} 

Since Kai is just a remastered and limited filler version DBZ so you can substitute it if you have a high nostalgia for DBZ otherwise Kai is about half as long.

The movies: Battle of The Gods and Resurrection F can be watched as standalone before Super in the timeline if you want (bearing in mind that early arcs of Super cover the same stories). None of the other movies were based on the manga/Toriyama's stories so it is doubtful that they are canon.
 
There is also prequel manga &lt;Jaco the Galactic Patrolman&gt; which comes before Dragon Ball chronologically but only serves to introduce a few characters for Super. It can be skipped without missing much but it is only 1 volume long. 

Super is done for now; although, the manga &lt;Dragon Ball Super&gt; is still running. The series will probably continue once enough chapters gets released so that the series can run without catching up too quickly. 

Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z were not separate in manga so &lt;Dragon Ball&gt; covers the entire story up to the end of DBZ and can be found in color. 

I assumed you were more interested in the anime than the manga but just in case you want to read it all, the leanest route for the manga (IMO it is best to read in the order they were released and not in chronological order):

1. &lt;Dragon Ball&gt;
1. &lt;Dragon Ball: Ossu! Kaettekita Son Gokuu to Nakama-tachi!!&gt;
1. &lt;Ginga Patrol Jaco&gt;
1. &lt;Dragon Ball Super&gt;

Put dog biscuits in your hand (or the ground with your hand covering them) and let them smell it, they will try get to the goodies in the middle, do not let them get to it, as soon as they stop trying, give them a WAY better treat. One of my labs didn’t give up the first few times for at least 10 minutes!! I use kibble and roast chicken. As soon as they stop and look at you like what the hell? Give them their favourite treat. I then take away my hand and put some kibble in a bowl, put them on a sit and try to put down the bowl, if they stand or try get close I will pick it up straight away, the food bowl doesn’t go on the ground unless the bum is on the ground. Once it is on the ground, and they are waiting for the command, I will give them the jackpot (you leave kibble, you get roast chicken and the kibble!!).

This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party’s integrity.

There's Brazile saying the fight wasn't fair because Hillary controlled the DNC. She's saying HRC had an unfair advantage by having control of the DNC before voters were able to choose the democratic leader. 

The funding agreement, the control, and the ~$80 million gave HRC an unfair advantage according to Donna Brazile.

After the 1st week, I got the bus 30 minutes after them - walked around the AG, couldn't find any of them, went to the snack bar and there they all were - drinking coffee and BSing - I was across the road next to some trees/bushes - they never spotted me - at 11:00 they jumped on the bus to go back to Hovey. The next day I had a roster set up and only one person could go to the AG each day and had the sign changed to open 8:30 to 11:30 and 13:00 to 17:00. 

Had to fix all kinds of dumb shit - huge stacks of paperwork everywhere (the E6 and E7 had went AWOL because they knew they were going to get busted - they forged DA 31's, flew to the states - a few months later they were caught, brought back, court-martialed, spent some time in leavenworth) - months of awards never typed up for people who had been gone for months - told them no one leave at 1700 unless the floor was swept/moped, all paperwork filed, etc. Had to actually set up a second shift to get the awards caught up - took 6 months but we got to where the soldiers were actually receiving their awards prior to clearing. Found stacks of Art 15's never disto. to finance, DA 31's never processed, you name it and it was fucked up.

Genital warts in women and men are like the warts you get on your fingers. They tend to stick out. On women you see them on the labia and around the vaginal opening. I've never seen them on the anus, but have seen plenty on cocks.

"lucifer","t5_2sbp9","Caine has been used as a plot point for two relationships and one possible character reveal.


1: Maze and Lucifer.


At some point, Lucifer has to see how much his actions have affected Maze and to what length she is willing to go to get what she thinks she needs.  She has been pushed into a calculation that the only way to get back home to Hell is to frame Lucifer for Caine's murder. He'd be disgraced, Chloe would hate him, and he'd have no other option but to return to Hell himself.


This has the added benefit, in Maze's mind, because as a demon (not human) she is the equivalent of a child in her emotional development, of hurting Lucifer where it will hurt him the most; Chloe. 


Remember when she came to him with her own pain due to Linda and Amenadiel and the feeling she was never put first even with Lucifer?  And remember he ignored what she was going through to talk about what HE was going through with Chloe?  That hurt her deeply and it is when she hatched her plan with Caine.  He helps frame Lucifer, she kills him so he can leave this earth.


And revenge to her is a form of expression, not a healthy or mature way to work out one's anger, but that is how Maze does Maze.


2: Chloe and Lucifer.


If the writers do what needs to be done, Caine's actions (there has been speculation and spoilers specific to this that I will not mention here) will be the cause for Lucifer and Chloe to finally confront how they feel about each other.  Maybe he finally opens up to her.  Doubt it is a big wing or devil face reveal but more of opening up of their feelings for one another. Finally for Dad's sake. 


3: Who Ella really is.


This is a guess but considering how involved Ella has been with Caine (her interest in him and his relationships) and the file he has for Gaudium (that was a big Chekov's gun that has to be fired otherwise it will be just dangling there), I think there is a reveal to come if not in the finale it will be in the early season 4 (the casting of a ghost Ella sees).


So Caine has always just been the object that will cause a resolution to conflicts.  His character was never meant to be permanent or the main story point - just a tool to get the main characters where the writers wanted to go.  Our first introduction to him was the files - before we even saw his face.  They set up his purpose right there.


It is time to wrap this up and move on.  I've lost interest as to whether Lucifer and Chloe get together.  If they don't that is fine with me.  What I won't continue to abide is this still a will-they-or-won't-they into season 4.  It is stale already. 


This may actually be the actor's fault, now that I think on it...they had the character slated for 10 episodes and he said he'd only do it for 15 so they stretched out Caine's story to accommodate.  They shouldn't have agreed to it. 
 The story, the use of Caine to affect the other characters, didn't have 15 episodes of content, in my opinion.  And now we've pushed out episodes to a possible season four.  It's just bad pacing.


Anyway, that is what Caine's purpose has been.  He was never meant to be permanent and it was obvious he would never have married Chloe.

After a bit of arguing with me I told him that if he wanted to work he needed to get up early tomorrow morning, drive down to where the day laborers stand and spend the day with them. Get to know them, and how they get jobs. The same principals apply to finding any job. Well he did just as I suggested.

He later told me it took a couple of trucks coming up and one of the guys telling him how to get noticed but he did get a job for the day doing landscaping. He busted his butt and at the end of the day the guy running the company paid everyone in cash. He also picked out two of the day laborers (My brother was one) and gave them business cards telling them to call him at 6am sharp if they wanted to work the next day. My brother worked with him for about a year and learned a lot. First, and foremost, you can not wait for a job to fall in your lap, you have to get to the front of the line and make sure you are noticed!

"Kanye","t5_2r78l","To elaborate further on your comment, the phrase ""Come to Brazil"" is a meme itself because no one EVER goes to Brazil. So Brazilians are always begging their favorite band/artist/whatever to come to Brazil. Thats why its funny, because you can see Brazilians everywhere around youtube, instagram, and twitter commenting @ their favorite artists ""come to Brazil please"". As for the iCarly thing, its surged in popularity over Lil Pump's tweet saying ""I wanna fuck iCarly"". So it's a bit of a hybrid meme. It has its roots in legitimate Brazilians begging people to visit their country, people memeing that, and then combining that with iCarly. Someone commenting that on Kanye's tweet, at the time they did, was just ripe for a good running gag to comment on any of Kanye's new tweets",1525132960

You don't have to try to be best friends with those who oppress you.  But you absolutely must pray for your enemies.  That is clear from the Scriptures and the Church Fathers.

"legostarwars","t5_2tpjq","1999-2001 used either the cartoon OT logo or the cartoon Episode I logo, or a minimalistic black box for the UCS sets, but the introduction of Episode II sets meant they would need something that could be more universally applied to all sets regardless of era. 2002-03 sets mostly used the silver circle on a black field with a blue glow, and the gold SW logo used on most other toys.

Late 2003 and early 2004 sets mostly used Lego's own blue box, and late 2004 packaging had a silver border with the words ""Original Trilogy Edition."" This OT edition packaging was used in 2005 as well, but RotS sets used Lucasfilm's official corporate packaging: Vader head tilted downward in flames, with a bright yellow-orange logo. 2006 packaging modified this slightly, with a Vader head floating over a planet (presumably Mustafar) and a silver logo. From 2007 on, Lego almost completely adopted whatever corporate packaging Lucasfilm was using for that year. The only exception was certain UCS sets.

2007: Left-facing 3/4 Vader head on a red background fading to black, white SW logo

2008: Continuing the 2007 packaging, with Clone Wars packaging introduced midway through the year (Phase I clone facing forward on white background with blue stripe, blue SW logo).

2009: OT sets used a ""retro"" package with a retouched 1999 logo on a black background and gold SW logo. CW sets continued the 2008 packaging, with new CW packaging again introduced in the summer wave (three 3D Phase I clones on white background, dark red SW logo).

2010: All sets now used 2009 CW packaging, with (yes, again) new packaging midway through--left-facing Captain Rex on a stormy blue background and white SW logo.

2011: Full adoption of the Captain Rex packaging, no deviations from the standard.

2012: Darth Maul, lightsaber ignited, on a dark gray-blue background paired with white and a dark gray-blue SW logo.

2013: Yoda holds his lightsaber at an impossible angle, dark green background (with Geonosian-inspired patterns from all the Ep. II remakes that year), white SW logo.

2014: Vader on a blue background now reaches out towards the viewer, lit from underneath by orange light, and a return of the RotS-style yellow-orange SW logo. Microfighters have no special packaging, only a silver SW logo, and UCS sets adopt a similar borderless scheme with only a gold SW logo.

2015: A Rebels-style stormtrooper helmet marked by a bit of Sabine's orange paint on a patterned gray background with orange ""overspray"" and a bright yellow-orange SW logo. Force Friday introduces the new TFA packaging: Kylo Ren, lightsaber ignited, on a dark red background with sparks floating around him (presumably from the Jakku village), with a white SW logo. Microfighters and UCS sets continue their minimalism, and are joined on Force Friday by new buildable figures with a simple white SW logo.

2016: TFA/Kylo Ren packaging is adopted by all regular sets, and Microfighters, UCS, and buildables continue in their old packaging. Rogue Friday introduces the Rogue One packaging: a single Deathtroooper, looking up and to the left, in a blue-on-black background in which several TIEs can be seen flying, alongside the white SW logo.

2017: Much like the year before, packaging continues from last year, until Force Friday II gives us sets in the new TLJ look: Rey looking forward, lightsaber at the ready, Finn looking the the right, Poe in helmet looking to the left, on a white background with red SW logo. This is the first official Lucasfilm packaging to use real-life actors' likenesses instead of helmeted, masked, or otherwise CG-rendered individuals. Starting with the UCS Falcon, all UCS sets now use a dark, spare design reminiscent of the original 2000 UCS packaging.

2018: Again, we start out with last year's TLJ box, even for EU sets. Solo sets give us Han, Chewie, Lando, and Qi'ra on a cloudy yellow background with white ""cloud"" overlaid, and a golden yellow SW logo. One difference this year is that at least for now, it does not appear that the Solo packaging will be used on any non-Solo merch, and the TLJ box will continue as the standard into the summer.",1525132961

I adapted to hit 50/50s in the dominus by either playing them side on so the 50/50 would squeak out side ways or play to hit it last with the nose of the car.  With the Octane I can just stick with going head on 95% of the time and now finding I win out a lot more.

The way I see it now is that the Dominus has conditioned me to be better overall with the car in relation to the ball so when I moved to the taller Octane hitbox I gained a larger margin of error to work with.

Read ""Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers"", ""The Body Keeps the Score"" or any current research on mind/body connection. Look up online the ACT test. Just a few simple questions and learn how adverse childhood experiences can effect your health later in life. Unresolved stress and trapped emotions can have a huge impact on your health. As for tapping, I looked into it. Tapping has nothing to do with energy meridians. That is a crock. The physical act of tapping will tie up the conscious mind and allow things to come out of the unconscious. But knowing where a problem comes from does not deal with the problem. Tapping when it was originally invented ended with a NLP technique where a hand was moved randomly in front of the eyes while the memory of what is causing the problem was kept in the mind. This was fairly effective. This ending to the tapping sequence became known as Rapid Eye Movement Desensitization therapy. When it became recognized as a therapy that had some effectiveness with PTSD it came under control of licensed psychologists. For an unlicensed person to do this now would be considered practising medicine without a license. It was removed from the tapping sequence thereby rendering tapping ineffective. ",1525132963

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","It's strange how wealthy schools and Title 1 schools can be so eerily similar.

In my school we have kids who have coasted along their entire lives, and are going to some expensive (but academically lagging) school because of their parent's money.  There are some academically gifted students there, but by and far most of the students are average or below average.  The academically average but street-smart kids explicitly cheat on assessments, and when it's reported the teacher is held to an extremely high standard of evidence: you have to have a videotape of them in the act, but you need permission to record the tests.  And if you ask for permission they'll say something like ""Well, this is really your fault because if your class was more inclusive they wouldn't need to cheat.""

We have kids who do nothing but play on their phones all class.  They're supposed to hand them into the office at the beginning of the day, but most of them don't.  I've been reprimanded for confiscating phones because apparently I can't confiscate personal property.  If you make a writeup, you're accused of ""letting it come to that"".

I've recently heard kids saying that they could probably take a swing at a teacher they don't like and they'd have to take it or get fired.

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","&gt; PGR destaca protagonismo de Gleisi em esquema que rendeu 1,5 bi para o PT
&gt; =========================================================================
&gt; 
&gt; ^(Brasil 30.04.18 20:41)
&gt; 
&gt; Na nova denúncia contra Lula, Gleisi e o marido PB, além de Antonio Palocci, a PGR fez questão de ressaltar que há ""prova de materialidade e indícios suficientes"" de que o PT embolsou pelo menos R$ 1,48 bilhão em propinas.
&gt; 
&gt; Os quatro citados, entre outros, ""concertaram ações criminosas para a arrecadação de valores ilícitos por meio da lesão ao patrimônio e à moral administrativa de diversos entes e órgãos públicos, tais como Petrobras, BNDES e Ministério do Planejamento"".
&gt; 
&gt; Segundo Raquel Dodge, Gleisi e o maridão ""assumiram protagonismo"" no esquema criminoso e a petista ""foi uma das mais beneficiadas"" dos desvios na Petrobras, no BNDES e nas parcerias com a Odebrecht e a J&amp;F.
&gt; 
&gt; Faz sentido todo o empenho da petista para livrar Lula.

As the wedding planning has progressed (we're only 33 days away now) everything has gotten more casual and rustic to the point where my dress no longer fit the setting even a little bit. So I went to a bridal consignment shop and found this lovely dress that I think will fit well in the setting instead. The slip-like layer and the lace are two different pieces that come apart entirely, I was thinking of wearing just the slip once we got further into the night.  Feedback welcome =)

Don't really know much about Under Night or RWBY, can't really comment on those. I do like the RWBY one, though, stands out more compared to Persona and Under Night as a variation.

Ultimately a Buddhist is someone who understands that all life is subject to suffering in all the known world - so that Buddhist strives to achieve enlightenment so they can go to Nirvana and escape the endless cycle of death and rebirth.

So, at least considering a Buddhist who believes that upon his death he will simply be reborn endlessly into a world of suffering - yes I'd expect them to be afraid of dying - at least before making significant advances towards enlightenment.

I don't know that, upon rebirth, a Buddhist really knows which of the worlds of suffering he'll be reborn into. He would naturally want to be reborn into the Realm of Man, because only those in that realm can honestly seek enlightenment. Heading up or down the wheel would be bad, that would basically be another lifetime of suffering you have to endure without being able to work towards ultimately ending it and freeing yourself.",1525132967

"washu","t5_2rpkc","Honestly, academics and alumni are really not going to be much different at WashU vs. Notre Dame. They're pretty on par in both of those areas. I think the two main differentiators you need to consider are going to be 1. South Bend vs. St. Louis and 2. the general vibe/culture of the respective student bodies.

If you've seen my comments in other threads, I generally am pretty upfront about the fact that I really dislike living in St. Louis. That being said...I think I would hate South Bend much more. I don't know if you've had the chance to visit, or if you would even have time to do that at this point, but keep in mind that South Bend is a verrry tiny \(and relatively dangerous\) city with not much at all going on apart from Notre Dame. That will restrict your options in terms of social life/general off\-campus activities quite a bit. Location is absolutely an important factor you should keep in mind. I unfortunately really undervalued how much location can impact college experience\-\- it really makes a massive difference in how ""at home"" you'll feel, and your sense of contentment/comfort on campus. But of course it's very dependent on your personal preferences. Notre Dame will have crazier frat parties and tailgates to compensate for what I assume is very short supply of bars and clubs. Maybe that's something you'd enjoy. \(washu on the other hand has relatively tame frat parties, and I have never once seen anybody tailgating here ha\)

Notre Dame has a very distinct student culture that is definitely not for everyone. It's pretty religious and conservative. I think if you are not either of those things, you might feel a little out of place. I do know a couple people from my hometown who specifically sought ND out because they really valued having Catholicism incorporated into so many aspects of campus life and the opportunity to meet people from similar backgrounds. WashU is very much the opposite\-\- the dominant religion on campus is Judaism, but people tend live more secular lifestyles; religion isn't something that enters the conversation outside of actual Jewish events, in my experience. The student body attitude is decidedly more liberal/left\-leaning, like most of the other T20 schools. 

I think ND is more suited to kind of a unique niche of student who prefers the conservative environment and the lifestyle of a quieter, more isolated town. If you're really into sports and want that to be a part of your college experience, ND definitely has the edge there. JI'd recommend you spend time thinking about where you think you'd be the happiest without worrying too much about whatever minor differences there are between the engineering schools. ",1525132971

* Timer Ball/Evosoda is debatable. Timer Ball can combo with Rare Candy, but Evosoda never misses.

Then you add to that the fact that NA has one server with an average ping for everyone while EUW gets to have 2 separated servers. Maybe the ping helps build better players as well and that would explain why BRs/CHs, although they invest a lot of time in league, are not top 1.

The Silmarillion is more important in that regard than LotR or the Hobbit because it's chiefly about Elves and covers a huge period of his history but none of those books are ""the main"" story because there is no such thing. 

&gt; where he thought the SIL was as big as the LotR

To be fair he was sitting on a lot of notes and manuscripts that were later condensed into SIL, Unfinished Tales, Lost Tales, the 12-volume History of ME, Children of Hurin and god knows how many other books and collections.

Then all of a sudden I see two more geared guys. I'm shitting my pants trying to figure out what we should do. My buddy ends up trying to push and gets killed. I sit in a bush watching his body, sure enough one of the guys goes to loot, I kill him but now have given away my general location. Still in the bush the two guys fan out trying to find me, one walks past me heading to the tree closer to gas station, I'm contemplating shooting him but hear the second guy LITERALLY right next to me in the bush but can't see each other (dense bush). The guy that was further cleared that area and starts heading back to where myself and his teammate were. He was 15 feet in front of me and I decided I had no other choice but to open fire thinking he saw me. I down him but now the final teammate knows I'm in a bush nearby. I'm trying so hard to relocate and get away from my initial shots to get a new angle but as I'm doing so he just unloads his 60 round mag into the bush and toasts me. I didn't get any of the gear but that is the hardest my heart has pumped from a game and it was an absolute rush even if I didn't come out on top. If I did, I think I would still be shaking because they were all fully kitted and one of the guys had a pilgrim so I would of had 2 guns on me and a pilgrim full of weapons and other gear.

I forgot to add that I've seen my GP for my back pain before and they've referred me for physical therapy. Also that the urgent care I went to i was out of network.

 I've been on the waiting list since late December. When I called to make an appointment with my doctor the front desk woman told me the wait could be up to 8 months. I'm assuming I'm not a priority because I wasn't involved in an accident.

I've also gotten an x-ray of my back. It said that I have very mild scoliosis ",1525132977

2) We don’t all just devolve because of something called game theory. All morality is nature’s emulation of game theory, since even if you don’t care about purpose or right or wrong, things that observe the laws of game theory survive better and propogate and evolve. Getting what our evolutinary instincts and drives want makes observing the golden rule the optimal response in most cases- non-zero sum games are the best games to play. Even if you come to the intellectual realization that these things are pointless, you can’t escape them. You’ll still feel cold, hungry, bored, like you need to shit, guilt, horny, etc and it will be torture not to just go with the flow of those impulses so we do what is easier and just answer them. This is why sufficiently intelligent psychopaths actually don’t break the law and engage in altruism despite it seeming like a paradox on the surface.",1525132977

"malaysia","t5_2qh8b","The DAP does have multiracial appeal. Come on, Chinese majority seats does not mean 100% Chinese. The only highest majority is 80%. Most of the seats are around 50-60%. 

DAP has another 9 seats that have Malay majority population.

So, it's a good thing that MCA is contesting almost exclusively in Chinese majority seats? At least DAP does not depend exclusively on Malay votes to win seats. 

Your grudge is with the DAP pretending that they're a multiracial party when they're not? A party which has more than one race is multiracial, even if one race is dominant. You cant just ignore the Malays, Indians, Orang Asli and West/East Malaysians just because they're in the minority. The fact is they ARE multiracial, even if one race is the dominant. 

Yes, it's getting a little over the too much right now, but the problem with her is she flat out accused the entire thing of being a trap DAP set her in, and accused a women/chinese of bullying her just because a little wit and sarcasm in saying she will definitely not support BN? 

Most of the initial comments were targeting her ""glass heart"". How to be an elected representative if you can't even face harsh comments? How has LKS survived 50 years of politics then? People don't just cry or complain about being bullied when facing criticism, they solve them face on. Put on a strong face and say ""thank you auntie, please come out and vote yea"". The whole thing wouldn't even be a problem if she didn't post the video and made it worse for herself.

Did you know that her husband, a Datuk, had a press conference yesterday without her attending (she is resting at home lmao), coming out with evidence that the white shirt lady is a hardcore DAP supporter's wife, when the sole evidence they had was a picture of the white shirt lady and the DAP hardcore supporter. Reporters kept asking for more evidence, but that was the only thing he could give. 

The reporters even asked for evidence to prove that it was a trap set by the DAP, but they couldn't answer any questions.

Hog's breath can get busy late at night but we've always enjoyed some day drinking there when it's slow. Good live music, good food.
Sloppy Joe's is one of the most well known bars in Key West. Have a drink or two and listen to some music, but don't bother with the food it's nothing special.
The Green Parrot. The house beer is awesome, they do live music often, it's just got a really good atmosphere.
Garbo's grill has great food. It's basically just a food truck with a small bar next to it.
First Flight used to be Kelly's. I liked Kelly's better but they have Tito's on tap and the Mo-Tito was life changing.
Waterfront Brewery has pretty good beer and good happy hour deals.
Two Friends Happy Hour for Margaritas and Shrimp

Jet Ski tours are a lot of fun, we've always gone Fury and have been very happen with them.

I'd also recommend Lazy Dog Kayaks, the pickup service is very convenient and getting away from the busy waterfront and downtown area is nice.

I'd recommend getting bikes especially since you're there for a short while and may want to get around quickly. Another option is the Duval Loop bus route: https://www.carfreekeywest.com/duval-loop-bus It's a free bus route that will run you around the busiest areas.

If you want to go to a beach go to Fort Zachary.

If you go to Hemingway House go across the street to the Mojito Bar before and/or after. Happy Hour 12-3, good, cheap rum punch.

For sunset you have three options.
Mallory Square is interesting but very crowded.
Take a sunset charter boat. I recommend Danger Charters Wind and Wine. Some companies have big party barges and it just doesn't look very fun, though I've never been on one of those.
Finally, there is a Coast Guard cutter museum ship that you can tour. They open back up one hour before sunset for $5. They have some drinks available and the cost helps maintain a piece of history.

I could go on but I should probably stop.

Also, thoughts on ""new standards"":

1) What true standard is there for a ""good guy"" besides that which God has established?

2) If that standard is different from God's standard, for it to take the place of God's standard would require it to be from an authority higher than God.

Within 5 years I was up to $125k including company stock grants. It was at that level that I was able to pay them down extremely fast. 

One thing I did to have smaller goals with this was to split them all into their individual loans on the Navient website. You have to ask to do this. Then I figured out which ones would really screw me over if I didn't have them paid off by the time the interest only payment plan expired just to reduce the risk. Then I looked at which ones I could make bulk payments to every 6 months when I was able to sell of my company stock that was given to me as part of my pay. 

My advice to you is to focus on your career path if you have time. Kill it there so you have more cash flow faster to help with these loans and your life down the road. ",1525132979

Once saw 2 little kids, both about 5-6 yrs old, get surrounded by 20-30 geese and almost overrun trying to feed them bread.

I do agree though that we should be able to outrange most ADCs, and we can currently with our Q. Hitting our Q should be the time we move up and put ourselves into a vulnerable position to hit our E. I just think we are too vulnerable despite already achieving our engage condition.

Let me know what you think. Your change is definitely a solution to the same issue, I just worry that balance point is far enough to outrange everyone and he is able to get away too easily after missing an E, while we should still be punished when missing.",1525132980

"pinkfloyd","t5_2qhwe","It's just the way the record companies did it to divide the royalties. Writing credit earns more. Many bands release songs just as ""the band"" such as Song written by: Van Halen, let's say. Then they all get an even share.

But then you're paying Michael Anthony for a writing credit so...

Everyone already knows each person in Floyd brought something special to the song that could never have been recorded or performed by anyone else. Roger on his own may not have had the success if someone else was in David's, Nick's or Rick's place. The songs would have been completely different, even if the basic melody was the same.

It's like a script. The screenwriter creates the movie or show entirely on their own. It's the actors that bring those characters to life, that's what they pay them for. The Joker would be completely different if anyone but Heath played him, so it's just a contractual thing. When directors try to change the way an actor portrays a character, or when the screenwriter is ""directing on the script,"" actors get very defensive about that. 

So, to make a long story even longer, we know they all get credit for creating a whole song.

The buffer queue is set to 10 seconds, but it still craps out and begins to buffer for 20-30 seconds at a time, but the strange part is, when the buffering stops it resumes where it left off, doesn't jump ahead back to live, so I'll get to the last 10 minutes of a TV show and it just abruptly ends and skips to live.

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","Before you can decide what you should do with the money you will need to figure out when you intend to use this money.  You shouldn't invest your emergency fund or any money that you will need within the next 5 or 6 years in the stock or bond markets because the value of the account could drop just when you need the money . You should park the money for those short term goals in the best high interest savings account or GIC you can find. See https://www.highinterestsavings.ca/chart/

Many people your age will soon be doing things like relocating, setting up an apartment, saving for their next vehicle, paying for a wedding, saving for a home down payment, travelling, etc. and all of their money will be allocated to these short term goals. 

If after allowing for all of this you have any money that you are confident that you won't need for at least a decade you could invest in a passively managed, broadly diversified portfolio of low cost index funds.  If you are patient and passive this kind of investment portfolio should have higher returns than GICs, high interest savings accounts or more than 80% of actively managed mutual funds. To learn a bit about this kind of investing I suggest that you read https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/investing  and http://canadiancouchpotato.com/couch-potato-faq/ 
  
These pages list 3 - 4 options and before you use one I suggest that you read the Canadian book Millionaire Teacher (Andrew Hallam, 2nd edition - 2017)  Once you have read it you should understand more about the the markets, the financial media and how to avoid the costly human reactions to them.

Every *99* minutes I scour the vast plateaus of [eBay](https://www.ebay.com), and randomly select *99* categories.

Then I choose *99* items from each of those categories, with an exact price of *99¢*.

Then I randomly choose *ONE* item from the 9,801 items I've found, and post it here.

Will it be something useful, funny, or rare? I have no idea, I'm just a bot with a random number generator. What I can tell you is it will be exactly 99¢, no more, no less!

First, undo ALL BIOS CPU overclocking - reset the clocks and voltage fully to stock.  

Next, boot into Windows and launch ZenStates.  

P0 is the boost state - the top turbo state the CPU will ever see.  Set this to a safe voltage, first, such as 1.4V.  Then set a known-stable frequency (such as 4GHz).  

Next, use the same settings for P1 - this is the software-set boost settings. It will be the frequency set anytime after the core has gone idle.  

Finally, you can leave P2 alone or you can set it to something like 15X and 0.9V.  This is the idle frequency and voltage.

Keep both C6 check marks checked.

Management tells them, ""stay until the freight is done."" So they get around that by making sure I can't have more freight ready to go out.

I am trying my damnedest to contain myself.  Going from certain doom to jubilation in the split second of a syringe doing its work... it's more powerful than any drug that I have ever taken... and I have tried them all.

Roco and his flaring nostrils are interrupted when the door swings open and a messenger delivers a few quiet whispers that froze Roco's bulging red face. It makes me wonder if HIS blood also suddenly turned clear white.

""Please excuse us,"" the messenger tells me as she gets everyone out of the room, ""your lawyer will be with you in a minute.""

My what?  I don't have the cash for that.  If he tries to screw me like the last guy, I am NOT going to hold back this time.

The door opens again and a... woman?  NO. I'm not surprised by the gender, but... her face... her skin color... she looks closer to that skeleton from biology class than a person.  She walks... almost floats... to her seat opposite mine and smiles at me.  No words.  She just watches me with a stiff corporate smile.

""What're you staring at?  I don't usually do women, but for the right price, I can accomodate.""  I'm lying of course.  I love female clients.  Negotiation skill!  Woop woop!

She chuckles, then cracked voice flows out of her mouth, ""So lively!  I love it..."" she pauses and checks me out again before continuing, ""Tell me.  What do you want out of life?  What is the one thing you will give everything to acquire?""

""That's easy!"" my whole-life's worth of day dreaming has prepared me for the ultimate answer, ""I want a triple platinum card with unlimited credit that I never need to pay back.""

""Fantastic.  I have just the thing,"" she places a card on the table.  Dargcion Corp?  The one that owns everything on this side of the country?  ""No one will say no to this card.  I will take care of all charges.""

""Uh... Wait... I thought this was a joke.""  I pick up the card to examine it.  ALWAYS check the merchandise.  I have seen 3x Plat card only once back when I was younger.  It's got that same expensive nana-tech or whatever on it.  I put my thumb on it and... it sync!  The card is mine now.  Mine alone.  This is too real.  Too easy.  ""What's the catch?""

""Dargcion Blood Certification isn't just for criminal investigation.  It can also identify humans destined for greatness.  Humans like you are uniquely qualified to be my personal assistant.  That card is your payment, you may use it however you like.  Do we have a deal?"" she extends her hand toward me... pale and skinny with glossy red nail extensions.

""Personal assistant huh?""  Well... I am in a police investigation room full of sensors and cameras.  Is she really going to scam me here?  Never thought I'd be a wage slave but... maybe I can just have my fun and quit later.  Worst case scenario, I will cash in on my runner friend's tab to extract me.  Oh hell... my blood is clear white!  I can just snap her skinny neck when nobody is looking.  ""It's a deal!""  

I grab her hand... and damn... cold as ice.  Wait... her hand is getting... colder... and colder...  ""Ok...?""  I try to pull my hand back but... she's not letting go!  Her nail extensions digs into my skin and her hand starts to grow... SCALES?

""OUCH!!!  I change my mind!  No deal!  Let go!"" I form my other hand into a fist and send it straight to her... scaly face.  It is caught by her other hand... no...  by her CLAW.  ""What the hell, woman... uh... whatever you are!  I thought i'm your personal assistant.  Is this how you treat employees?""

""Relax,"" her voice is different now... less cracked... more hiss, ""you should feel honoured that your pure essence is liberated from that dirty vessel and joined eternally with Alessandria.  All transactions are final I'm afraid.  I've made sure of that.""

Maitland-Smith occasional table (already sold for $400)  
2 vintage Bernhardt leather chairs   
Bernhardt king poster bed.  
Gorham silverware set.  
Unopened craftsman planer, router table, band saw.     

Unfortunately one of the units we didn't get likely had the rest of the Bernhardt bedroom set and no way to get a hold of the winning bidder on that one.

Not sure what you're asking here.

&gt; Establishments serve to operate as a single unit despite being made up of individuals. 

But they don't actually operate as a single unit.  Viewing an aggregate as a single unit is just an abstraction -- it's *not actually* a single concrete entity, it doesn't *actually* have its own autonomous will or consciousness, and it only exists as such *because* it's made up of individuals whose motivations are in alignment.

&gt;  The actual line between individualism and collectivism is impossible to define

It's not impossible to define in the slightest.   It can be defined in a variety of crystal-clear ways.  People may have different definitions, and argue about their definitions, but to the extent that people are using different definitions, they're ultimately talking about different things.  

&gt; And being an absolutist is pretty idealistic of you.

The Doctors' plot (Russian: дело врачей, ""doctors' case"", also known as the case of ""doctors-saboteurs"" or ""doctors-killers"") was an antisemitic campaign organized by Joseph Stalin. In 1952–1953, a group of predominantly Jewish doctors from Moscow were accused of conspiring to assassinate Soviet leaders. This was later accompanied by publications of anti-Semitic character in the media, which talked about the threats of Zionism and condemned people with Jewish names. Many doctors, officials and others, both Jews and non-Jews, were promptly dismissed from their jobs and arrested.

"ethtrader","t5_37jgj","Reposting a shitpost I made from last year when we were in this price range:

Hi Everyone,

I notice there is a lot of new faces around here, so first off welcome! If you have just purchased your first ETH(s) you are now part of something amazing. I’m sure for many there is a lot of terminology thrown around here that might be a bit confusing so I’m hoping this post will help the newcomers get a better understanding.

**Security:** First and most importantly is security of your ETH, I do not suggest leaving your ETH on exchanges the old saying goes “if you don’t hold the coins, you don’t own them” there has been many, many cases of exchanges being hacked and funds lost.

Two methods I suggest are either my etherwallet - https://www.myetherwallet.com/ (careful for DNS attacks though!)
Or if you have more than a couple of grand in the space, it’s a really smart idea to get a hardware wallet such as ledger nano s - https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s

Now moving your crypto from the exchange is known as cold storage so I’ll go through the process of how to do that with a ledger nano s. First time you set up your nano you will be given 24 words that are used as a recovery mechanism in case your nano malfunctions, is stolen, you or someone else puts the wrong pin 3 times. This is incredibly important to store safely if anyone gets this they can get your crypto, so your sock drawer is a terrible place to hide it.

I suggest you transfer a tiny amount to your ledger first (couple dollars worth) to get used to it. Then purposely enter the pin incorrectly 3 times and then restore it using the 24 word phrase you wrote down. This ensures that you have written it down correctly and that restoring it works, worst case scenario here is you messed up and you lose a couple of dollars. This is preferable to finding out years later you fucked up and locking yourself out of your crypto forever.

Now that you crypto is on your nano we have to make sure it’s cold enough for storage, take your nano put it in a zip lock bag maybe put a fork in to protect it from future forks. Put the zip lock bag in a small container and fill it water and place in your freezer. Currently it’s been researched on what is the ideal temperature to cause safe sharding do not try this yourself as you may damage your ETH.

**Staking:** This is a new and exciting development for ETH moving away from the old method of proof of stake where we had a bunch of miners chained together hitting stone blocks for our amusement and we threw coins at them. I’ll explain how it works.

If you have enough ETH to stake on your own which is predicted to be around 1000 ETH atm (not confirmed) then this part is for you. Start off by making sure your stake is long enough to pierce the heart of a fully grown vampire, if you are unsure how long this is consult your local vampire hunter. After you have the stake make sure to get it blessed by your local clergy or just put some holy water on it. Vitalik and crew are rounding up vampires at the moment in a test net but they will use their main net when they get around to it.
When this happens stake your vampire through the heart, make sure to nail the vampire to a cross prior to doing this. ETH has sown multiple times this week by hitting $666.666 and hovering there it is aligned with the great beast so we have to defile this sacred icon. Now using your pre obtained ceremonial dagger soaked in the blood of innocents make a small incision in the vampires stomach. Take your cold storage ETH and place it inside. Don’t worry about it thawing this beast cold dead heart will keep it frozen for all time.

This process of your ETH been bathed in demonic bile will cause it to mutate and multiple over time, this is what is is fantastic about proof of stake. You need to prove that your staked your vampire, me personally I’ll be putting a sign out the front of my house welcoming people into my back yard where I will leave this unholy vessel.

Which brings me to the next part if you don’t have enough ETH to stake alone. Over time the filth will bleed from the wound and congeal in a pool around the staked vampire, this will give those with less ETH the chance to stake as well. Take your ETH and throw it in the pool. I will be using an inflatable pool bought at my local hardware store to collect this gunk.

Last and finally we have to put said vampire on blockchain. I will be encasing the vampires feet in a cement block and then running a chain to my neighbours house to link to his vampire. This is a requirement for all validators of satan ETH. 

So when it’s time to stake come on over, have a beer throw your ETH into the pool and we can watch in awe as this lifeless husk speaks in encrypted demonic tongues enabling low cost, fast, cross border transactions and changing the world one dapp at a time.

This is truly incredible occultist technology and I’m happy to be part of it. I hope this helps you have a better understanding of ETH.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Hoo boy, ok.  It definitely seems you are significantly more frustrated than I originally thought.  That's ok, I've been there a bit.  Hopefully I can help.  Here's a few thoughts:

There are three overarching issues that I'm seeing here that appear to be fueling your frustration:  Wizard being weak early game, DM being unknowingly harsh on you, and your teammates being extremely min-max while you are not.  I'll tackle each issue one at a time.

First, an overview of Wizard:  You are extremely weak in the early game.  You have almost no spell slots, and one attack from basically any monster can take you to zero hit points.  Wizards are amongst the strongest classes later in the game, so this is a bit of an off-set.  It should start to stabilize a bit more around level 3.  You just need a bit more hit points and a few more options on spells.  Many people have made great spell recommendations, so I won't continue with that, but just know that it is hard, but it will get better.

Your DM:  While I do not think he is singling you out or trying to hamper your fun on purpose, it does appear some of that is happening.  This happens with a lot of DMs.  He has rules in place with how he thinks something works, and that doesn't totally jive with what you think.  That investigation rule seems lame to me, but I could also understand it.  Also, the rule of cover so you can't attack is kind of lame, but again if they want to do that, it's their game.  It is not completely unheard of.  Overall, my suggestion would be to just talk to the DM one on one.  Tell them you didn't take some of his variant rules into account when making your character and that you'd like to make some changes with this new knowledge.  Change your feat you took to be Perception instead of Investigation, because apparently Perception is just hands down better and more useful.  Say you'd like to change some spells around so that Firebolt isn't your only attack cantrip.  Something with a saving throw as well would be more useful in situations where an enemy is surrounded (this will happen a lot with 3 melee characters + you).  If they refuse to let you do any of this, then I would suggest just telling them that you feel completely useless and are not having any fun.  How would they suggest you fix your issues then?  I think being completely honest with them in that scenario would be helpful.  They're probably not aware of what they have been doing or how it has been weighing on you, and just being up front about it might help.

Your party members:  Ok.  You have some serious min-maxers here.  That is totally fine, I am a fan of that myself.  However, if you are not min-maxing, then I totally understand how that makes it very frustrating for you.  I had a case where we rolled for stats in our group and everyone got very high scores - except for me.  I simply went to my DM and said I'd like to bump up my stats a bit as I felt useless.  It worked out well for me, and maybe including this in your discussion with your DM would help.  Now, I also want to warn you:  That build your Warlock is talking about is one that is very popular online, but it is EXTREMELY party unfriendly.  Basically, at around level 2 or 3, he gets the ability to see through magical darkness.  You combine this with the ability to cast the Darkness spell, and essentially he has Advantage on every attack against enemies in the Darkness, and they all have Disadvantage on all attacks.  The problem is that even his allies in the Darkness will have Disadvantage.  Basically, he will be making himself strong while weakening the entire rest of the party.  I have never played with someone who did this, but I am warning you so you (and possibly your DM, if they've never dealt with it before) are aware.  Additionally, if your Warlock is a variant human, they could have the Polearm Master feat, which would be why they got two attacks in that one battle - however, if they actually have the Sentinel feat like you say, they should not have gotten that second attack, and are not following the rules correctly.  Additionally, there is no way to have two feats at your level, unless your DM allowed a feat at character generation, or something along those lines.  You may want to check on the Warlock's feat and what they actually have to ensure they aren't playing incorrectly.

So, what does this all boil down to?  You need to have a conversation with your DM.  Let them know that you are not having fun and you feel extremely weak, both because your teammates are min-maxing extremely, and you are not, and also because the things you chose to try and be good at, they are not really letting happen.  See if they are willing to adjust their rules to be more understanding towards your build, or if not, will allow you to rebuild your character to be stronger under those rules.  Adventure League lets you essentially complete rebuild your character under Level 5, so I usually use that same rule in my games, and I feel like it's a decent argument for a DM to allow that.

I do completely understand how you're feeling.  I was the same way when I played CoS with other overpowered characters.  My talk with my DM helped quite a bit for me, so I hope it does for you as well.  Also, just try and remember that sometimes people just make mistakes.  No one is perfect, including the DM!  They might make a ruling that seems like it sucks for you, and they may not have intended that.  The best course of action is to very calmly have a discussion with them about it outside of the game, and hope that it gets cleared up for next time.

Good luck!",1525132995

Anyway back to me now. I took a break to work on my mental health, which was my main downfall during my two years at sixth form. I still haven't gotten help and every day is an honest fucking drag, it really does feel like a waste of time, since I won't have this much free time to work on myself again. On results day, I took the decision on a whim because I was honestly fucking exhausted after the two years of mental torture I put myself through. Moreover, I struggled a lot when I actually had to confront who I was going to be in the future. It was fucking visceral, coz after a levels, it was as if I was thrown out into the deep end with no clue as to what I wanna do or who I wanna be. What I mean by the struggle is that I had to swallow the hard pill that I was not as smart or intelligent as I initially thought I was, despite the effort I put in and the stress I destroyed myself with, I still haven't made progress in life. People did often tell me I had potential when I was younger but over the years I've stopped hearing that because I didn't know what to put it towards and still don't. In order to escape my demons, I'm working a dead end retail job where I don't see a future for myself in at all. I work anywhere from 9-10 hours a day, 6-7 days a week for dog shit pay. If there's one thing I can recommend, its that you look for a job as soon as possible if you want to take a gap year because its really hard to find anything decent these days. I get by by telling myself that this is temporary and I will find something soon but even I've stopped believing that now. I get rejected from most apprenticeships I apply for and will have no other choice but to apply for a course at uni for this year that I am willing to put up with for three years. Reason being is that anything is better than what I'm doing now, as its really fucking hard to ""adult"" when all you've known is school and education for the majority of your life. I am on a gap year but still frequent this sub to gain insight on the situation of people like me who don't know what to do. Sorry for the rant but I had nowhere else to post this. ",1525132996

They shouldn’t be extremely easy to get but they should always be available to those who wish to protect themselves and have a clean slate.

The Counter Culture was based on Marxism and Crowley.  It was a rejection of all tradition and cultural norms.  There is an American Culture.  There is the Counter Culture which is fundamentally not American.  

One of the years major Counter Cultural events has been ""Burning Man.""  Burning Man was a pagan Celtic ceremony the involved human sacrifice.  No wonder some ""Do as Thou Wilt"" Crowley Marxists end up there?  

There is cause and effect with the Spiritual.  Notice I am Manonfire63.  The Holy Ghost is Unquenchable Fire.  A man on fire may be someone who is Prophetically on fire through the Holy Ghost.  Where does ""Burning Man"" the pagan celtic ceremony that involved human sacrifice come from?  Satan is a liar with a paintbrush. There is cause and effect to the Spiritual.  Satan lies about what that is, or he paints over it.

"atheistparents","t5_2tfua","I had to have a hard conversation with my Mother-in-law about raising our daughter's without religion. 

My wife and I thought that if we simply did not introduce them to any religion until they were old enough to ask, that it would be the best way to go. Largely, with the hopes that it would be seen as a compromise (not just her religion is being excluded, and I was not going to 'teach' atheism as an option either) for when we had to broach the subject with my mother-in-law. It did not work. At all.

Not only did the compromise of no religious talk(indoctrination, but we didn't want to use a loaded word) not work at all, it made things worse. The compromise weakened our decision, particularly with how rigorous we could defend it, as we are defending a compromised position. But it also was seen by her as a lack of commitment or confidence in our decision. And despite our confirmation that we were not changing our minds, she keeps picking away at it like it was a chink in a set of armor. The chink was not there, but her worrying at it only made things worse. Not only did it really frustrate and upset us, it has made the wounds stay open as she just hasn't decided the conversation is done since she perceives that she just has to find a way in the chink to change our minds. 

Further having a 'talk' with her at all was also a huge negative. I've lost so much respect for her, and while I am unsure how much respect she has for me personally now, I will say that it appears to be low enough I need to now watch out for her trying to undermine our decision. 

So my advice as someone who went through a similar situation recently with a 5 and 4 year old. Introduce god to the little monster, but also discuss the benefits, and disadvantages. You could go so far as explaining god, but simply say that you personally, or you and your partner do not believe in it. I am now seeing it as the religious equivalent to a mental vaccine. Second, talk to your father in law now. But phrase it as 'I know you are religious, but we are not' talk, instead of a we want to exclude our child from religions talk. Largely since no matter how you describe raising your child without ANY religion, he will only hear 'We want to raise our child without YOUR religion'. And for a man who, like my mother-in-law, has made their religion a central pillar to their life, they can't fathom an alternative.

With all this said, it's how you bring up your child that is important. Your father in law is going to agree and disagree with some of your choices. I think I tried too hard to not offend my mother-in-law and it meant that I was not focused on telling her to back off. If she was sticking her nose in on: how we discipline the girls, or where we are sending them to school or any other number of choices, I would have stepped up to bat swinging. However, we wavered with the worry about her being offended and our relationship may never recover. 

If he is going to take offence no matter what you choice, it is best to rip that bandaid off quick. Maybe it won't go better than our attempt, but I can say for sure the 'waffling' attempt we made trying to please everyone definitely didn't. ",1525132998

You buy something with a lower price tag as a gateway purchase. Both riptide models feel practical, familiar(kicktail) and humble and like Toyota they are decently priced with good resale value. From what I see and hear, Riptide has good customer support as well. The question is what do you want to do? Just commute?

"therewasanattempt","t5_39ne7","**Coastline paradox**

The coastline paradox is the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a well-defined length. This results from the fractal-like properties of coastlines, i.e. the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension (which in fact makes the notion of length inapplicable). The first recorded observation of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson and it was expanded by Benoit Mandelbrot.

"books","t5_2qh4i","I just read \*\*The Warren, by Brian Evenson.\*\* It's an interesting little sci\-fi book about a ""person"" who interacts with the last human that had actually been created by fertilization. Very philosophical, but I think it stops too short. The story\-building was the best part.

\*\*Touching from a Distance, by Deborah Curtis.\*\* This is about Ian Curtis of Joy Division, written by his widow. There are heated reviews mad at what she has written about him, and while the picture she paints isn't a happy one I have no reason to doubt she tells the truth about how bizarre he was, and his tendency to be dishonest and abusive. Very depressing read though, I actually needed to find a way to de\-stress after blowing through it in a day.

\*\*Through the Shadowlands by Julie Rehmeyer.\*\* This is about a science writer's journey through chronic fatigue syndrome and figuring out what was likely causing her symptoms and her ability to get back to health and a new life. She repeatedly claims to have wanted to focus only on the science of the illness and potential solutions but even she writes some scientific errors in her own book. It's rather meandering and unfocused too, but it's an autobio of sorts, so I guess that can be expected.

I just began \*\*All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai"" after avoiding it for months and now I wish I started it as soon as I first thought of reading it! It's really amusing, told by a disappointment of a son by a genius who created time travel, and somehow he screws things up royally so he's stuck in OUR version of 2016 instead of a technologically advanced 2016 that he came from.",1525133001

In the second game they took away the modes, but integrated all the effects into a more standard control scheme. So instead of selecting power mode and kicking or throwing something, you just hold in the interaction button to get the 'power' version. 

Literally the only thing that ended up going away from the original game was being able to select speed mode while prone and power crawl, lol. A single lost feature, but a much slicker and intuitive control scheme was really impressive.",1525133004

"iwatchedanoldmovie","t5_3o2sn","I'd like to offer an alternate perspective on it. I've always seen Gone With the Wind as a tragedy, and at the heart of it you have Scarlett, an anti-hero.

She looks like a hero: she's beautiful, rich, part of this veneer of respectability and culture, but like everything else that the South was built on, it runs only skin deep.

One prime character trait for Scarlett is how doggedly she pursues her individual goals. It's the reason for all her successes. How she survives the war, keeps Tara, all that. But it's also the reason for all her failures. She refuses to look at herself and decide whether a particular goal she has is even something she wants. Take Ashley. She convinces herself that she wants to marry him and she pursues that goal even after meeting Rhett and the obvious chemistry they shared. Through her scheming she even ""gets"" him, but that success is ultimately a failure. She didn't really want him, and he dies anyway before her deluded fairytale life can begin.

Same with Rhett. She thinks at the end of the film that she can get him back after everything. Why would she even want him? He clearly doesn't want her. Her determination won't allow her to stop despite her own failures.

And the ""Tomorrow is another day"" is a very southern idea. This ability to brush unpleasant truths under the rug if they don't conform to her delusion. I think it makes her a tragic figure.

And while the portrayals of black people in the film are simultaneously from their time (1930s) and from their period (civil war south), I think it's important to note that, unlike films like *Birth of a Nation*, the South of GWtW is not preserved. They lose everything. Those portrayals are not rewarded with success.",1525133005

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","Well first off thanks for the mention :D this is a lot more fleshed out than my interpretation.

As for my opinion, the XV 1 character being a GoD is a really great idea and reduces the redundancy of having both CaC from the previous games their (not to mention all 2 million people who dress like beerus in the lobby finally getting some recognition lol). I'm also fond of the XV 2 CaC being an admin, I feel like that game made the connection between Trunks and the CaC to be much closer so that seems like a fitting conclusion.

The establishing of a serious threat is done well with no only your first two CaCs but also Goku taking notice (that and playing as Uub sounds nice because I'm a sucker for changing perspective in games) but there's something in there that I'm not too fond of unless you have plans to change it as the hypothetical story continues.

I felt the first two games really lacked stakes by the virtue of the fact than the Supreme Kai of Time could pluck fighters from any point in history so even if you fail, Goku, Vegeta, Whis or Beerus can just come and clean up. Not only that, but the CaC is often portrayed as being several levels below them in power which felt like a slap in the face so personally I would like to minimise the role of Major characters in the story.

The distortion in time you mentioned with Raditz and Nappa remembering fixes a huge problem with the very premise of most XV missions, none of the changes stick around long enough to make an impact so this sounds like a fun idea. I'd say SSBE is a bit much considering what fodder characters they are and I feel that bombshell would be better spent on different characters but I think I see the idea behind it.

All and all, sounds like a pretty good start to give this game it's own story",1525133005

"suggestmeabook","t5_31t41","I’m listening to Red sister on audiobook right now- it’s excellent.

Obviously you can choose to read what you like, but in YA (which is rife with strong female protagonists currently) it’s somewhat of a genre standard for there to be a romance (for better or for worse).  There are some great books out there that feature a bit of romance, and it seems a shame to miss out on them due to that one element.

If your willing to forgive that, **Uprooted** by Naomi Novik is an absolutely fantastic read.  Another suggestion would be **Graceling** by Kristin Cashore.  I’d like to echo anything of **Tamora Pierce’s** as she was my favorite author growing up and her work stands the testament of time.  Her earlier works (Song of the lioness series, circle of magic series) are aimed at a slightly younger audience, and her more recent writing (Provost’s Dog series, for example) are the upper end of YA. They’re all good though.

Maria V Snyder has an awesome Study Series, starting with **Poison Study**.

**The Hero and the Crown** by Robin McKinley might work...it’s been too long since I’ve read it to remember if there’s romance.

I liked **Dragon’s Milk** and sequels by Susan Fletcher, but I read them over a decade ago, and all that lasts is a positive impression.

I’ll keep thinking on it, and come back to add if anything else pops into my head.  I hope at least some of this is helpful.  I know what it’s like when you finish a good book and want another that scratches the same itch, and I hope you come away with some suggestions (mine or otherwise) that fit the bill.

Edit: Oh, forgot to add, Novik also has the **Temeraire** series, an alternate history *but with dragons*.  I haven’t read it yet, so I can’t speak to the romance element, but she’s a great writer so if you’re interested it’s worth checking out.",1525133006

I've do have a bit of anxiety and I have a CBT diary where I rationalise my insecure thoughts. I've dealt with insecurities in this relationship before on my own without bringing her into them because I realise it's my problem and not hers. 

I did the same with this issue but something felt different this time. I didn't feel it was my mind completely making things up. 

It's hard to assess my tone from a text post but I'm not seething or looking to belittle her in return or anything.

Wow that was a god tier episode. First half was funny as fuck, second half went from heartwarming to sadness and back to heartwarming what a rollercoaster of emotions I went on

Renge further solidifying herself as my favorite character, her reactions and the way she talks to Natsumi is the best. I'm also really fond of sister sensei, when she was talking to Hotaru about the tradition of eating watermelons and then just goes 'oh, a watermelon'. Idk why but I found her tone of voice really funny. Actually I love their entire family, the bit of Hikage bragging about going to highschool in Tokyo only to get upstaged by Hotaru was amazing. Side note, what's with the oldest girls looking like little kids? You guys eating alright?

Both of the characters they introduced this episode were great. I also like the little montage of Renge just walking around before she met Honoka. I get the feeling she does stuff like that a lot, since there's not much to do in the country and she has no one else close to her age (Hotaru being the closest in 5th grade and she just moved here). I love that 'I need more lighting!' line and the tanuki trick never gets old. Love the way she looks over like asking 'you impressed??' 

I hope that both of them are recurring characters, or at the very least I hope Hikage is. She adds a very nice dynamic to the group Imo",1525133008

* Avengers standing over frozen Cap is up there.
* The scene where Dark Phoenix announces herself or where she eats a sun.
* Bane breaking Batman's back.
* That scene with Green Arrow and Lantern talking about drugs.
* Panel in Maus where Spiegelman shows himself with a mouse mask.

Edit:

* Bullseye stabbing Elektra
* Magneto ripping the adamantium out of Wolverine
* Panel in Hulk where he fights Wolverine \(you know the one\)
* Spider\-man struggling to get out from under a bunch of debris
* New Mutants facing the Demon Bear
* Dani cowering under sheets that are morphing in to the Demon Bear
* Dead Cap following Civil War
* Nova ripping Annihilus inside out
* No More Mutants \(unfortunately\)
* Cap punching Hitler \(I know the most iconic image is a cover, but he does it again in a later issue as a panel\)
* Not sure there's an actual iconic panel from the first Galactus story, but the Alex Ross panel of Silver surfer dodging Galactus' beams while the FF argue with him in Marvels is up there.

Perception is everything and nothing. Everything because it puts you in control to always try to enjoy whatever life throws at you, and nothing simply because no two people will ever have the same.

The logistics of even just deploying a raw ETL pipeline is not trivial. Even just getting functional enough with pandas to be productive with basic data munging is again... not trivial. What's that? Another f'ing byte that utf-8 or mac-roman can't parse? The rest API we're pulling client data from decided to spit out some random unicode characters on a Japanese street address that broke the system? Your logging sucks and it took you two hours to hunt down a simple bug? You weren't organized setting up your ETL DAG and now it's a pain in the ass to run the second half of this job after you hit a fail point halfway through? Your docker skills suck so you don't even know how to contribute to the conversation with the team about how to get this thing deployed on AWS? Holy fuck you guys, there's a lot to learn. I suspect the majority of the companies out there looking to get more into ML don't have the data to go beyond making more basic predictions with scikit-learn. Getting production ready even with just a basic logistic classifier is no joke.

You provide your serial number and some $$$ and the company will give you a code to unlock those features.

When it comes to children for instance, they tend to “love” their parents. But even that love can be broken. And parents on to children may have near boundless “love” but I’d say it has bounds.

And let’s tangent for a moment.  where does that near boundless love come from. Was it always there or was it built. Id say it is build. It’s hard to stop loving if you have loved for a long time. They are you kid/parent. But with out time a child/parent is nothing more than a stranger.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I appreciate the time it took for your thoughts, although you were correct in that you didn't convince me. 

&gt; Before Trump was POTUS, there was 0 progress on the front of ending the Korean War.

Ending the Korean war isn't the issue. The issue is a nuclear-capable despotic regime.

&gt; From there, you can see Trump's hardline approach to China (talking tough on trade, talking tough on NK, talking tough on how he isn't afraid to blow up NK, taking the congratulatory phone call from the ""President"" of Taiwan, etc.

So Trump is 'tough buddies' with Xi? All that 'tough talk...' how did it help exactly? All that stuff is just political theater for followers to say 'look how tough our president is.' It's mindless and childish on the world stage. Take him threatening 'fire and fury' should they threaten us - NK called his bluff in hours. That looks dumb to any observer who is not a Trump supporter. Same with his tweets denigrating diplomacy or boasting about the 'bigger button.' 

And the trade disputes - how do they help? You have cause-and-effect all backwards here, rolling an unrelated issue into NK policy. If Trump wanted to incentivize Chinese cooperation through tariff threats, he would've either 1) imposed them before China signed on or 2) threatened before, then ceased threatening after China signed on. Instead, after China signs onto international sanctions and upholds them, then the Trump administration raises tariffs? The truth is that Trump's trade disputes follow a separate agenda, one that runs counter to our diplomatic influence in the region - among China and allies alike. 

With respect to the One China policy - how did that help? You're again muddling cause-and-effect. Trump brought it up briefly as president-elect, then said nothing on it for months. Now in March, he's singed a the Taiwanese Travel Act that challenges the One China policy. If Trump were creatively using this as leverage, he would've either 1) threatened to do so, then not follow through once China cooperated or 2) done so, then revert US policy after China cooperated. Instead, no public threats before they cooperate, China cooperates, then he acts against them. Completely backwards. 

In short, your evidence for Trump involves him tweeting random things, and then separate issues whose timing make no sense relative to China following through on NK sanctions. ",1525133017

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","&gt;Agents 

There's been ridiculously popular agent removal mod for agents for every TW game because the AI spams them. TBH the only people who seem to care about them being gone are the ones who couldn't win Legendary without crutching on them.

&gt;Religion, Culture

Have always been irrelevant public order inputs. If you know how to play the PO minigame, they did not add anything. CA did the smart thing and removed feature bloat. 

&gt;Naval recruitment

Manual naval battles were the single worst thing added to the Total War franchise. They've been a miserable shit show in every single one of the entries that has had them. The AI has basically stopped playing the naval game and I certainly find that my play experience has been massively improved by autoresolving them. CA not wasting resources padding out this non-feature is a good thing. 

&gt;Localised recruitment

So apparently you enjoy the false complexity of busy work more than you enjoy the actual complexity of managing a scarce resource. Ok. 

&gt;Forced marches 

The entire point of the change is to increase the importance of the operational decisions made by the player. If you can't just turn on your NOPE drive and flee a stupid positioning decision you might actually have to think once in a while when playing this game. 

They've instead added capital building that applies a -50% campaign map move speed debuff to enemy armies -- meaning entering enemy territory is or should be a serious decision on higher difficulty. This in addition to the supply changes -- as in, you now have to have supply -- the replenishment reduction, the lack of ability to attrit the AI with irrelevant minor settlement garrisons, income generation pushed out to places that the player can't defend with free troops, no mercenaries, supply and harsher seasons should result in a slower pace. 

Now that could all go out the window if the campaign AI can't handle it and if it is too easy and quick to assault province capitals which IMO it is right now. I can already tell that on legendary I'm going to have no trouble taking water facing cities with naval attacks without waiting a turn because I can bait the AI into making stupid decisions by bringing cavalry with the naval assault. Either the AI sends its main force to chase after the cavalry and prevent it finding an undefended gate it can chop through -- allowing me to land my infantry and wtfpwn them -- or it'll oppose the infantry landing and I can backdoor them with the cavalry. This is entirely driven by the ease with which units can chop through doors and the small default settlement garrison + a lack of AI prioritization toward developing larger garrisons. 

And a big part of _why_ it probably can't handle it is that movement is still based on pixels as opposed to discrete provinces a la EU4/Medieval 1/Shogun 1. The AI is never going to be as good at pixel movement as the player. It simply cannot handle the concept of choke points, baits, feints or double teaming armies in the current system because it has too many variables to work through in the amount of time allotted.

&gt;Ambushes 

Neither the AI nor the vast majority of players use this ""feature"". The only time I've ever been in ambush battles is when the AI makes/gets baited into a dumb decision in force march. It has always been better to defend in a settlement and attack when the AI makes a poor positioning system than to give up initiative and risk being double teamed by AI armies in legendary. 

&gt; Squalor 

Another irrelevant PO input. 

&gt;Sanitation 

Dude at the end of this list the only conclusion I can come to is that you have no clue how templatized settlement builds are. Here, enjoy learning just how trivial it is to completely eliminate thinking about provinces in Attila : 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624928863

I honestly think 90% of the criticism is from people who never learned how to minimax the campaign game and are sad to see stuff that didn't actually matter go because hey, it seems like it probably did stuff and oh yeah things with the same name exist in the real world. This same crowd also doesn't seem to get that CA has moved from the incredibly dull steady state factor management focused on provinces to dynamic character focused flow management where factors and points of importance change in importance based on player decisions within the game state. 

That's the whole point of the expanded loyalty and politics system. If your king dies or you lose territory, you also start to lose control over the nobility and shit snowballs fast. Unfortunately they didn't think up a good way to have something similar happen if you are winning hard, and didn't give the player a real incentive to fuck over the AI nobles by holding more territory than they should -- thereby pissing people off -- or giving it to particular nobles. If you needed noble support to take major decisions -- as in CK2 -- and if estates were what determined your income rather than just provinces it'd be a different story and the player would have a real game driven incentive to risk making poor decisions that lead to interesting outcomes. 

The tldr here is that there are indeed some bad design decisions in ToB, but you've hit none of them. ",1525133018

She doesn’t care if the hospital charges twice as much, then offers a 50% discount as long as it looks good on paper.

Positive:

- Good shape and size that feels comfortable for my 20x10cm hand ( I like having a choice in size with the other models fk2, fk1+)
- Good plastic coating that I prefer over rubberised because of durability and feel.
- Flexible cable that doesn’t interfere 
- Smooth, large mouse feet
-  Low force actuation middle-mouse button
- Good build quality with only a slight mouse wheel rattle when shaking)
  
Improvements I would like:

- I would prefer lighter mouse one and two clicks using omron switches instead of huano (for this reason I prefer the Logitech G Pro for MOBA/RTS
- Would prefer the Pixart 3360 sensor instead of the 3310

My mom is definitely narcissistic and emotionally abusive, but nowhere near the level of a lot of the Ns people on this sub have had to deal with. Between her gaslighting and her projection, sometimes I really do wonder if it's all in my head, but this bingo board has really helped to solidify that she is a narcissist and even if she has never physically abused me (beyond the occasional slap in the face), that what I've experienced is still legitimate and real (I was able to check off everything on the list, except maybe bad cooking? I don't know because she never wanted to cook and would just go out for dinner all the time).  ",1525133022

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","Hello everyone, as someone that loves Stardew Valley, the people(originally one person) working on Stardew Valley gave the game a lot of love and still do to this day. A multiplayer beta was just released for PC and other things. I cannot express enough how much both this Witchbrook game will be great but Stardew is also great in its own right. 

Definitely keep an eye on this if you were excited for Mysteries but  were only met with miseries. As for Stardew, I definitely recommend looking it up as it's a lot of fun. Their subreddit is also one of the friendliest places here on Reddit.

Stardew Valley is a Harvest Moon love letter to what made the series great and even has its own unique flavors of gameplay. Its origins came from a guy named u/concernedape and he gave so much love to his passion project and continues to do so.

EDIT: I want to clarify that concerned ape isn't part of making this new game but the publisher is the same and it is being inspired by CA's character and world building",1525133023

"AskThe_Donald","t5_3fuwj","TThe Vatican II teaches such things but not the Catholic Church. It is taught both in Scripture and Catholic dogma. The idea that one is saved outside the Church is Protestant beliefs. 

Pope Gregory XVI, Summo Iugiter Studio, May 27, 1832, on no salvation outside the Church: 

&gt;“You know how zealously Our predecessors taught that article of faith which these dare to deny, namely the necessity of the Catholic faith and of unity for salvation… Omitting other appropriate passages which are almost numberless in the writings of the Fathers, We shall praise St. Gregory the Great who expressly testifies that THIS IS INDEED THE TEACHING OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. He says: ‘**The holy universal Church teaches that it is not possible to worship God truly except in her and asserts that all who are outside of her will not be saved.**’ Official acts of the Church proclaim the same dogma. Thus, in the decree on faith which Innocent III published with the synod of Lateran IV, these things are written: ‘There is one universal Church of all the faithful outside of which no one is saved.’ Finally the same dogma is also expressly mentioned in the profession of faith proposed by the Apostolic See, not only that which all Latin churches use, but also that which… other Eastern Catholics use. We did not mention these selected testimonies because We thought you were ignorant of that article of faith and in need of Our instruction. Far be it from Us to have such an absurd and insulting suspicion about you. But We are so concerned about this serious and well known dogma, which has been attacked with such remarkable audacity, that We could not restrain Our pen from reinforcing this truth with many testimonies.

Acts 4:8-12

&gt;Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! 9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 11 Jesus is

&gt;“‘the stone you builders rejected,
    which has become the cornerstone.’[a]

&gt;12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”

No one can be saved outside the Church. A person who has denied God cannot be saved. Dogma and Scripture is very clear on this.",1525133023

"Psoriasis","t5_2rdms","I suffer from psoriasis on my scalp, eyelids, and neck.

For scalp, I use Fluocinonide 0.05% Soln 60ml.

I also use coal tar shampoo every day when I have a flare up that's bad or makes my scalp raw. 
 
My eyelids are a different story. I wash it with a whatever soap I use that's mild and not irritating to my skin. With a washcloth to slough the skin. Most meds are not good to use on eye areas because they increase ocular pressure. So I was told to use Hydrocortisone Cream. They attempted to prescribe me some but it had some fragrance in it and caused irritation. So I use the store brand hyrdocortisone cream 1% (kroger). 

I am also allergic to prednisone. So I cannot take steroids. 

Everyone is different. This is what works for me.

If he couldn't manage his behaviour to put the phone away, or to hand it over because he was using it inappropriately then no more phone  - he doesn't need it. Trust me. He forgets lunch/gym clothes - he can manage the day without. He wants to stop and play at the playground and come home later, he can come home and tell you and head back out. He needs a calculator - the teacher will have one to borrow. He needs to take public transport - if he can't manage it with a phone to navigate then he's not responsible enough to take it independently etc etc.  
  
No phone for however long, when phone is given back it comes with terms between you him and the school - it's turned off, it's only out at lunch etc. But again - he doesn't *need* to have it. It's a privilege, not a right. If he can't handle it, then it doesn't go to school.  He also needs to apologize to the principal, teacher, staff - whoever was involved.  Then you need to work on new ways to cope - meditation, have him breathe out to the count of five,  yoga or walks or running so he can blow off steam, reward charts for good behaviour. Just toss it all in his direction and see whats helping. And if it's not helping then there will be something else to try.",1525133025

I know you said she was charged with trafficking,and but is she an addict?

Possibly committed time on three misdemeanors and a deferred sentence on a felony with ten years' probation, something like that. 

If she sold it to other people, it's going to be a rough ride, especially if the charges are federal. If they're state, pray that the feds don't get involved. If she sold it to other people, a felony plea and committed time is pretty certain. 

Of course it bears mention that none of us here are familiar with any of the facts of this case. Maybe she can beat it. Let an attorney who has reviewed all the discovery guide those decisions. Also, delete this post because you said she stole them.",1525133026

It is true some sweeteners have an effect on blood sugars, but it's small and nowhere near as much as actual sugar. Erythritol and stevia are both well tolerated by most people. I'm also personally OK with all of the others I've tried so far (even ""evil"" aspartame) except maltitol, which upsets my stomach.

You might be kicked out within just a couple of weeks (not in LA though, those courts are backed up like crazy).

"lawofattraction","t5_2rfq0","I believe LOA works for everyone. I cling to the idea of opposite because that is what happening. I don’t like it because it is disappointing and leads to huge wastes of time. It also makes it feel like I’m stuck. Being stuck means I can’t do what I want. Being unable to do what I want makes me feel like a zombie. It’s very boring.

At one point I just let things be. I allowed others to decide things for me. I wasn’t the one who suggested going to the movies, to the store, etc. This worked out for a while. I don’t know if I became too comfortable or what, but eventually this situation didn’t work anymore.

Obviously not everything is opposite or I wouldn’t be able to function at all. I just don’t understand subconsciously what is going on when I want a sandwich and don’t get it.

"cosmology","t5_2r5v1","I haven't read that book but have studied philosophy.  Here are my thoughts on it.


Philosophy is the art of inquiry, but it has a special mode of questioning, a kind of de-creative one.  It uncovers and unpacks hidden assumptions, questions them, breaks down what we mean, and so on.  At some point the philosopher might stop, be happy that they can lay some pretty solid foundations, and start to building theories from there.  But at that point it stops being philosophy and part of the discipline in question.  And this is the big clue as to where exactly philosophy is useful.


There are some practical papers in philosophy off the bat, like critical thinking and argumentation theory.  These help dispense with a lot of the surprisingly common mistakes people make when they argue.


In the philosophy of cosmology, I expect there to be a lot of stuff pulled from the philosophy of science, maths, metaphysics, etc.  So there would be questions about existence, nothingness, what a scientific theory is, criteria for theory selection, what we mean by a ""law"" of nature, and so on.  There will also be a lot about the empirical method and how we can claim to know things.  Some of the more abstract questions would involve what we mean when we say something is true.  And then there will be cosmology itself, like foundations of the big bang theory, black holes, clockwork universes, cyclical time, things like that I presume.


So yeah, philosophy is unique in that it doesn't have subject matter of its own.  It's always the philosophy of something else.  It will never have any answers, but it will help us to better understand and formulate the questions we ask.

"ElectricalEngineering","t5_2sey9","When a motor starts there is an inrush to build the magnetic field of the windings.  An induction motor is basically a transformer with a short circuited secondary- transformers have inrush, too. Think about shorting the secondary of a transformer and energizing it- it would draw a lot of amps. Now, for a motor, that's essentially what's happening, but the secondary is rotating and develops a back EMF to counter the supply EMF. So as the back EMF develops it counters the initial ""short"" (inrush) and the drawn current decreases.

Sorry if it's not explained well. It's one of those things that makes sense in my head but it's hard to describe because it's so conceptual and abstract.

I have no idea how this would be calculated as inrush can depend on many things including the rigidity of the power system and the coupled load. I usually use 8x FLA as a starting point for estimating inrush but it really depends on the motor size and voltage you're dealing with.",1525133031

However, I don't think ""we're a tech company"" is an excuse to ignore the rules and regs of the industry in which they ultimately operate. If anything, that'll be for the courts to decide. In my opinion (worthless, I know), they provide a cab service, and they fall under the regs of the various markets in which they operate.

When it comes to what would be fair for accessibility? I'm not sure. A percent of accessible rides could be an option, 20% is likely higher than necessary, or perhaps working with existing cabs within their markets to provide service comparable in price and ease-of-use? They're sitting on literal billions in cash, I'm sure they can manage to find a solution that's better than ""we don't employ anyone, we can't be held responsible for the consequences of our company's existence.""",1525133033

"television","t5_2qh6e","I binged both a few years back because I was feeling nostalgic. Since it has been a couple of years I'm not confident with detail citing. 

I don't mean this in a derogatory sense, but I think people like TLA over LoK because TLA is a great TV show AND they feel nostalgic for it. Korra loses points for being a sequel, and having less people be nostalgic over it. 

A complaint I had with TLA is that the overarching plot moves slowly to the point where elements of it feel repetitive. Like, do you remember that episode where Zuko is spying on Aang and friends from a distance while talking to Iroh about regaining his honor? 

LoK benefited from having a different big bad for each season. The plot moves much quicker, which prevented the story from getting stale. The pitfall of this is having a BB who is uninteresting, like with the spirit monster from season 2.

One of my favorite aspects of LoK is the action. TLA took place during a war and there was a lot less action going on. 

Similar to action, LoK excelled in violence as well. I feel as though it's not fair to bring this up because the target audiences are different, but when discussing engagement/what I liked better, I find it necessary. For example, during the season 1 finale [](#s ""planes are being shot down, but you always saw people parachuting out safely."") But then out of mother fucking nowhere, a [](#s ""murder suicide that makes sense to the plot and character actions occur."") The violence becomes more common in the later seasons, with some parts catching you refreshingly off guard. 

I'm hesitant to talk about characters because I loved the characters in both of them. Korra went through more changes than Aang, which is more engaging as a viewer. She basically gets [](#s ""PTSD"") after season 3.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","That doesn't capture the problem at its root. The Republicans are just flat out hypocrits on budget and fiscal control. Especially Paul Ryan.

Second, niether is being straight with voters: you discuss spending at the same time you discuss debt, growth in debt, and repercussions of excessive debt. Part of congressional leadership is not taking the US over the edge. Dems talk spending without discussing debt. Republicans talk control but don't actually have any or want any apparently.

And voters have to care and will be forced to care eventually. Voters will have to choose between guns and butter. But we suck at making decisions ...

When that happens the zero credibility the Republicans have now will go even lower ... As I said the Dems never really ran on fiscal responsibilty and draining the swamp.

It's this level of institutional gratitous incompetence that's partly responsible for getting trump in. The us Congress has been taking zeros on everything from fiscal control, no progress on gun laws, or immigration over the last 6-10 administrations.

Put it this way: apply for a Malcolm baldridge national quality award. 45 percent is based on getting results .... Results ... Something foreign to the Congress. As problems get worse us polititicians just spend more times on talking points and positioning themselves for the next election ....

2.) a good Segway is just to kiss her neck and then stop for a moment and take off the clothes. I promise you won’t want to kiss the whole time anyway. Hopeful you both have talked before and she knows it’s your first time. That will really help, I promise. Talking during sex with help too. Ask her what she likes, look in her eyes (not like a creep though!) kiss her neck and body etc.

3.) just don’t. First of all, in the moment you will only do what feels right so it might not even come up. If her pants are tight unbutton them or take them off. If you both know the plan is to have sex, they are coming off anyway!

4.) if you really feel weird, wipe them off, but chances are she will be sweaty anyway. Use the back of your hands or finger tips lightly can feel really good as well, as long as it’s not the only thing. Light scratches can feel good too but if she doesn’t positively seem into it, stop.

5.) just ask her to change positions. My boyfriend and I stopped during our first time and googled positions because the normal ones weren’t working for us.

Sex isn’t as hot and heavy as movies make it seem. Good sex includes talking, checking in, breaks and more communication.

Make sure she’s feeling good and just enjoy yourself.

"sportsbook","t5_2s3v4","Sure, no prob-- (if you're OP, I think you forgot to switch accounts haha)

But yeah, the math behind it is pretty straightforward. Say a line is -200, you're putting up 200 to win 100, so 200/(200+100) is 2/3, or 66.7% implied.

+150 would be 100/(150+100) = 40%.

So if you think the actual probability of a win is higher than the probability implied by the odds, there's Value in making a bet. (How much to bet is a different question, depending on how much of a difference you think there is between implied and actual, and risk tolerance/bankroll management)


If I'm not mistaken, for the most part, games in a series are statistically independent events. That is to say the outcome of game 1 doesn't have an effect on the probability of game 2, etc.. the way if you flip a coin and it lands heads, it's no more or less likely to be heads again the next flip or the next flip, or the 30th flip.

In terms of hockey, generally the home team wins 55% of the time. That edge is still 55% regardless of losing or winning game 1. Obviously this simplified and doesn't factoring differences in ability of each team and other factors that might exist, but using these default probabilities-

0.55*0.55 = 30.25% home team wins 2 games

0.55*0.45*2 = 49.5% each team wins once (multiply by 2 because there are 2 ways to get to 1-1, win first game and lose second or vice versa)

0.45*0.45 = 20.25% road team wins 2 games.

So you're right that it's relatively unlikely that a team goes down 0-2 at home. From the outset it's almost 80% chance that it won't happen (100% - 20.25%).. but given the first game was lost, the probability to win (and not go down 0-2) is back to 55%.


It may or may not be true be a case for dependent events in a situation like being down 3-0 on the road and the team being demoralized and just wanting to go home or something. Meaning if games 1 &amp;2 are lost, the probability of winning game 4 depends on if game 3 is won or lost, not just 55% or 45% anymore. There's some fairly simple math to determine if events are dependent or independent (though it can be a bit hard for some to understand conceptually).

Hope this was at least somewhat interesting and let me know if you have any questions and/or need clarification for anything. 

I guess my point is just keep in mind there will be better spots for value which don't carry as much total risk and have more favorable risk/reward ratio.

It's nothing personal, but what we do as individuals matters, our reliance on automobiles and suburbs vs publicity transit is a cultural phenomenon, and we choose if we go along with it, or become a city dwelled etc. These choices have huge effects when millions of people all do them.

The things you mentioned are a subset of socializing. I already mentioned that what I listed is the absolute basics.

&gt; but in the end it won't net them the results they want.

I disagree. I've been dating/getting strange/messing around/fucking girls since 15. I could have lost my V at 17 but I still had some lingering religious ideals. I lost it at 20 by specifically following the basic tenants.

Now at 25, the results are so uncanny to me, I don't even believe it sometimes. However, I do have sex sporadically because I rarely go out. So I am not the best at giving the most nuanced information on the subtopics of the basics. That said, I firmly believe based on experience, that the quantity and quality of girls go up massively if you explore the basics, because if it works for a 5'4.5 nerdy Asian dude (me) then it should work for any guy. I also only follow the basics to good enough, I haven't mastered any of them.

Simply put, 110 lb me got me some girls, 14X lb me and years more of experience is getting me a hell of a lot more girls.

Anyway, your advice is solid too, if the basics are there.     ",1525133039

Guardians also had a positive effect but mostly to show that the Marvel movies could be funny while also being engaging action movies.

Stewart’s audience was also extremely liberal, not the blasé neoliberal establishment crowd that watches Oliver or Colbert today. They would have strongly backed Bernie, and the entire media/entertainment/political establishment was mobilized against Bernie (just as they still are mobilized against Trump.)

CPU is the processor of the computer. It used to be that higher Ghz = higher speed = ability to run programs faster, but that topped out and most processors these days have about the same speed, or can adjust their speeds faster as necessary. Now you also care about how many threads a processor has (a CPU has 1-2 threads per core) because that indicates how many tasks a computer can run without slowing down. This can have the same benefit as more RAM (run more programs at the same time), but also certain programs are cleverly coded to make use of multiple CPU threads at the same time.

The GPU is the graphics processor, used for gaming, video, and some other computational-intensive stuff. It has its own processor with some number of cores at some clock speed, so the specs will look familiar. It also has its own memory like RAM that usually has even faster read/write speeds than normal RAM. So the computer can put all of its graphics information in that GPU memory to free up space in the normal memory.",1525133041

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","Day 74 of no fap.. As I exited my vehicle to walk into work I caught scent of a female in heat 73.35 meters upwind. Because of the fog I couldn’t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid twenties, and healthy. My ultra attunated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5’6”. My mind, free of the constraints of porn and indecent imagery, was able to calculate her weight based on the ripple in the testosterone continuum produced by her footsteps as she walked away from me. Being that I was 10 minutes early for work, I made chase and followed her through the fog still without visual contact. I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement. Holding my ear to the ground I was able to faintly pick up on the conversation she was having with beta BF. Based on the annoyed tone in her voice I knew now was the time to strike. I readied my legs and concentrated all of my Testo-chakras into my Vastus Medialus muscles as I assumed a sprinters starting stance. I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY. As I began to slow down 33.6 light years later, I realized that while she would have wanted to thank me for giving her the gift of my superior seed that she was already dead and gone having raised my CHAD progeny to repopulate the earth. As I float into the the celestial abyss of the greater Crab Nebula I am not filled with regret for having left my world, but rather happiness for having left it a better place.

To give a personal story: I had to testify on behalf of my mother when I was Jace’s age. She was involved in a domestic violence case with her now ex-husband. She was the domestically violent one but she wanted me to testify that she acted in self defense and that HE attacked HER.

I was coached by her and a lawyer but I had such severe anxiety the day-of, that I forgot part of the story and messed it up during cross examination. She ended up losing the case (I don’t remember all the details abt the charges and consequences, but she was LIVID with me). I felt so much guilt for disappointing her when I shouldn’t have been lying in the first place. 

I fear this would happen to Jace and he would feel pressured by David and Jenelle to keep some sort of secret about how this really played out. A line my mom used a lot on me was “you don’t want your mom to go to jail do you?” Putting the responsibility on the child instead of owning up to their actions

Ah, sorry for the tangent. Your comment just brought back A LOT of feelings/memories. I hope Jace doesn’t have to be legally involved in this disgusting mess :(

In slightly, but only slightly, more sophisticated terms, we would like for the R-vector-space C (of dimension 2) to be the direct sum of the Real and Imaginary R-subspaces. In general, given a C vector space V, and a basis B of V (of cardinality n), we should be able to write V as the direct sum of two R subspaces, the Real subspace and the Imaginary subspace, each also of dimension n. This whole point of view will necessitate thinking of the ""imaginary"" numbers as an R-vector-space of dimension 1. Therefore, 0 is imaginary.",1525133044

Perhaps it is the other way around, where he (or Klopp) may view that his own unsettledness may affect the atmosphere or contribute negatively if he were to stick around and I'd assume that there may be an agreement for now that he take the leave of absence for the benefit of the group. 

I don't think the group's focus will be shifted with regards to the important games coming up. The only unfortunate thing is that the whole situation is at the media's mercy to be spun how they'd like to.

"EnoughTrumpSpam","t5_39usd","&gt; The sense of victimhood is outrageous. In some corners of the internet simply saying that a warrior woman with DD knockers and a skimpy chainmail bikini is stupid and juvenile and unrealistic and (the magic word) sexist would get me hung, drawn and quartered.
&gt; 
&gt; 

The reason they get so angry at this shit is because they have such weak personalities, they *define* themselves by what video games they play. Not by how they treat others, their constructive hobbies, their careers, their families... video games. 

When you come for their video games, it's basically a personal attack for them. Because their like for their nerd things literally *define them as people,* when you say having the only female option in X game being big tiddy orc ladies, to them it feels like you're calling *them* sexist.

This doesn't happen in movies or literature. If someone says ""X female character doesn't have that much agency, this movie doesn't depict women well at all"" no one gets seriously offended because watching that movie doesn't *define them.* There's no healthy separation between gamers and the game and that's why they're so up in arms about shit that literally doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. 

That, coupled with the fact that it's white guys who don't really face discrimination or know any minorities, means that big issues like racism don't seem like as much as a big deal as the the imagined leftist thinkgroup army coming for their self-worth/video games.",1525133046

If you prefer a 13 inch screen, I would recommend this [ASUS ZenBook] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075N1YHVK/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 8th generation, i5 quad core CPU which is one of the best in the market and great for your usage, 8GB of ram for smooth multitasking, good SSD storage of 256GB for faster boot up and loading, 13.3 inch Full HD screen which is a must have for this price range, lightweight, long battery life, and it is within your budget.
 
I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review, so here it goes:
 
 
 * You can forget about dual core processors with the new Intel Core i5-8250U with it's quad cores it has much better performance with up to 40 % extra performance than the old i5 7th generation dual core processor.
 
 
 
* Full HD (IPS) 13.3’ screen, which is good for its price range, It's IPS makes it visible from great angles.
 
* Ram is soldered to the motherboard so ram is limited to the stock ram wit 8G DDR3 but SSD upgrades are possible.
 
* Connectivity is where this laptop excels with pretty much everything you will need 2X USB 3 (type A) ports, 1 USB 3 (type c) , Micro HDMI port and Sd card reader. You would need a dongle for ethernet though.
 
 
* Battery life is from 10 to 11 hours of normal usage surfing internet over WIFI.
* Good keyboard with backlit.
 
* Minimal bloat-ware, Speakers are very good with Hamman Kardon speakers which is great for this budget, Average trackpad without buttons but overall, it's good, The build quality is great as the full body is made from Aluminum.
 
* It's very light weight and portable with a fingerprint reader.



If you prefer a laptop with a stylus you will need to take a 2 in 1 laptop, so I would recommend this [Lenovo Yoga 720] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076V6DPZN/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 8th generation, i5 quad core CPU which is one of the best in the market and great for your usage, 8GB of ram for smooth multitasking, good SSD storage of 256GB for faster boot up and loading, 13.3 inch Full HD IPS touch screen which is a must have for this price range, high build quality, backlit keyboard, supports pen, and it’s within your budget.

In theory yes they could all walk out and move to a different website. In practice everyone sticks around, not because Youtube is good, but because it is big meaning it has the infrastructure and the viewership to make producing content for them viable. Same goes for shit like Facebook and even reddit.

Streaming sites also have the ability to hold content to ransom with exclusivity contracts making sure that if you want to stay up to date on the most popular shows you **will** use their service. Sure there's always piracy, which also helps balance out abusive companies, however not everyone is going to be willing to pirate a show just because the streaming company hosting it is a pile of flaming garbage and most people are going to be willing to support said pile of flaming garbage if it means they can stay up to date with whatever's popular right now.",1525133047

"FFXVANE","t5_3jvck","So after lots of testing this here is what I have personally found success with.

1) it has absolutely zero bearing on when you complete the event.  This means when you have an ascension event pop up you do not necessarily need to fo it as soon as it pops up into que.

2) there is without a doubt brackets unknown to the user.  What I mean by this is for example ascension events for cits 5-10 ( as example only) fall into a different tier than CIT 11-15 or whatever.  This is the piece I have yet to figure out.

3) your building levels matter 100%!!! This means if you go for 1st all your buildings in your empire must be as close to if not exactly the same level.  E.G ig youd ascension event is for cit 10 make sure all buildings in your empire are cit 10 then level as many other buildings up to 10 within three hours.

We have tested this multiple times and I personally have ranked 1st over 6 times in a farm accoubt I have following this process. 

I always make sure every building, banks,barracks, hospital wards and and rss outside are exactly the same level before I do an ascension event.  I have completed and gotten 1st multiple times even with less than 30 minutes left on the clock.

Childish impatience and passing the buck. The bolts need to be installed before the lift is used regardless of who the contractor is or what was promised.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","a) I would say that being numbered among transgressors had nothing to do with the two swords.  He was crucified with a thief and another criminal.  His ""crimes"" against the Romans were preaching about the Kingdom of God and loyalty to a power higher than Caesar.  He didn't need two swords to achieve that, and if that was a crime then it wasn't a ploy because His Apostles really did have the swords already.

b) As previously mentioned, ""It is enough"" could be about the discussion being concluded, not necessarily about the number of swords.  Throughout the New Testament prior to Jesus' death and resurrection we see Jesus hinting about what is to come but the Apostles never quite seem to really get what is about to happen until it is already fulfilled.  Here Jesus is telling them that they are going to need swords more than a cloak with what is about to happen- as in, He would be taken by the Jewish leaders, tried and convicted and put to death by the Romans for stirring up trouble, and his followers would be fugitives and need protection.

c) Clearly Peter's actions here and the fact that they already had swords indicate that it would not be out of the realm of possibility to use them for self defense.  Christ stopping the violence and healing the ear is not to disapprove of self-defense in general, but to tell them that at this time He needed to be taken and crucified in order to fulfill God's plans.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Old guy here.  I can relate to where you're coming from.  If you find anything I have to say helpful in any way, great.  When I was a young man I was absolutely terrified of really good looking women.  The first one I actually ""went for,"" I got.  9+ out of 10 in both looks and body.  It was nothing special, except for what it represented.

I am very, VERY experienced, and have slept with and/or actually dated a lot of women who would be considered extremely attractive.  I have also slept with and/or dated many who were not particularly attractive (physically).  The differences, to me, were pretty minor.  Things like no/really short refractory period, but definitely nothing earth shattering like you might expect.  I could have cared less about what other people thought about my date's looks - that's just not where my self-esteem comes from.

To put the physical in some perspective, when I was young, I was of average height for my generation, my face an honest 7 out of ten, maybe, arguably a 7.5, and I was very muscular, with a body that would generally be considered an 8 to 8.5.  In other words, overall, I was above average in attractiveness, but nothing mind blowing, and there were LOTS of guys who were MUCH more attractive than me out there.

Here's the takeaway from all the babbling on above - the best guy you will ever have is the one who you like and love and who likes and loves you back.  The grass on the other side of the hill may be a different variety, but overall, in life, it isn't any greener.  This is my personal experience, having climbed countless hills in my lifetime, of all shapes, sizes and colors.  My wife is quite simply, the love of my life.  Partly because I'm old, I could effortlessly get all the ""hot"" young girls I could handle, (okay, at my age it would probably be more than I could handle anyway).  I would never in a million years consider cheating on my wife, because none of these women could begin to approach what I already have.  The super ""hot"" guy is going to bolster your ego and, temporarily, alleviate some of the feelings of shame, (feeling less than), you may have, but that's about it - unless said super hot guy likes you and is in love with you, and, the feelings are mutual, in which case his looks aren't gonna make much difference in the long run of your life.

I wish you the best and hope you get to experience what you're looking for.",1525133051

The next worthwhile step up from that would be the $130-170 red dots from Vortex or Holosun (including their rebranded sights sold as Primary Arms or Sig Sauer). From there, I'd suggest looking at each brand's offerings in that price range, and see what best fits your intended use. Personally, I'm interested in trying out the Vortex Sparc II, which is currently on sale for $149.99 at [Brownells](https://www.brownells.com/optics-mounting/electronic-sights/red-dot-sights/sparc-ii-red-dot-2-moa-dot-w-mount-sku100014334-66525-137795.aspx). Ideally, I'd see how the Sparc II handles in comparison to the Vortex StrikeFire II that's currently on my AR, and move one of the sights to my Extar EP9. Realistically, though, I'm probably going to end up getting the TRS-25 for my EP9, since I don't really see the point in sinking a whole lot of money into optics for a silly range toy.",1525133052

and no that doesn't make me question my sexuality. I know I'm attracted to women and women's bodies. the thought of male bodies is pretty repulsive. 

but are you telling me if  you met scarlet johansen and hit it off with her and you guys go home together and you reach down and she has a dick. you're saying you wouldn't want to put it in her butt any more? she still looks exactly the same as she did before. and is the same person you wanted to fuck moments ago. 

Idk. I think people say that this must be so complex but really they're just afraid of admitting something as harmless as ""its not the dicks that bother me about being gay. its the rest of the dude that's the problem cause he's not a woman""

If the plot is what the movie is about, the theme is what the movie is *really* about. I'll give some basic examples.

Jurassic Park: Life finds a way - The whole movie is about how nature can't be self-contained and the arrogance of man is thinking we can play God.

Back to the Future: If you set your mind to it, you can accomplish anything - First said dismissively by Marty after he gets shut down for Battle of the Bands. It's a quote is father repeats but doesn't believe it because of their dead end lives. Later when Marty sees his father insecure about his own creative pursuits, he feels a connection. Marty repeats the words to his young father but earnestly this time.

Batman Begins has a few: It's not who you are underneath, but what you do that defines you - Pretty self explanatory. It mirrors Bruce Wayne as the facade wearing the true mask, while his actions taken as Batman say more about his character.

Also - Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up. Again, pretty clear. All about the power to move on from loss and tragedy, and the strength gained from it.",1525133054

The price hike for the Switch version is inconsistent with the expectations that Nintendo themselves have set. Since Nintendo didn't think the game was worth $60 when it was brand new, it's not surprising that people will read this situation as them taking advantage of consumers.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","If true, then there seems to be some clear dishonesty or obfuscation going on, either on the part of Heinonen or the IAEA.

Basically, the major departure that I saw in the presentation today from what I've seen previously was the claim by Israel that they had hard evidence that Iran actually had made the decision to *build and detonate* nuclear weapons as opposed to merely deciding to do weapons *research* as a way to build up capabilities.

That is a very substantial difference.  Researching how to make a bomb is one thing.  Creating a program with the explicit goal of actually building and detonating bombs is something totally different.

Now, Israel claimed today that the building and detonation was an explicit goal of Project Amad.  Heinonen seems to confirm that this is an accurate claim *and* that he knew about it *and* that he informed the IAEA.  Why does all this matter?  Well, in the final assessment by the IAEA on past issues of the Iranian Nuclear Program, it straight up says:

&gt;In Iran’s submission of 15 August 2015 under the Road-map, Iran provided the Agency with information concerning a number of organisations described in the 2011 Annex and on their relation and functions. In this regard, Iran, inter alia, denied the existence of a coordinated programme aimed at the development of a nuclear explosive device, and specifically denied the existence of the AMAD Plan and the ‘Orchid Office’ as elements of such a programme. 

So to summarize based on the info we have:

* Israel claims to have docs that prove that Project Amad had the explicit goal to actually building and detonating an atomic bomb.
* Heinonen seems to say that he's known this all along and that he briefed the IAEA on this.
* Because they know about all of this because Heinonen informed them, they knew the Iranian denial of a program designed to develop a bomb was a complete lie.
* The IAEA certified the deal anyway.

See how something doesn't add up?  I mean, if we believe what Heinonen is saying, the IAEA *knew* Iran was lying at the very start of the entire deal and still signed off on it and has maintained that Iran is in compliance.  While I guess it is possible that this is the case, that would mean we can't trust the IAEA to properly flag Iran even if they catch them in a complete lie.

Call me crazy, but if we are relying on them for much of the verification and we can't trust them to hold Iran accountable, then I'm not sure the deal is worth the paper it is written on.",1525133056

Have you ever considered that Utah’s pollution and infrastructure problems stem from a huge influx of people, and the fact that only 6 years ago we were in a Economic spiral of death? 
The pollution would be better in a perfect world, where everyone can afford a electric car, and have solar on their roof.
The problem of stressed infrastructure and pollution can’t be easily fixed, and any attempt to fix them any way but slowly and carefully out at risk what economic recovery we have made.

I’m not a close minded person. I advocate for ecological preservation where it’s practical, or needed.
My house has solar on it too, because it’s efficient and saves my family money.

But these problems can’t be fixed fast. The only way to fixed the inversion problem would be to ban gas burning cars, and that would cripple the lower class.
As for the problems of traffic, the state is doing all they can. The simple fact is that no one planned for Utah’s population to have such a massive boom.
There is no simple answer. Except a slow and steady one.

For example, a great incentive for getting solar panels are the tax breaks it provides.
If similar incentives were offered for hybrid and electric cars things would improve.",1525133057

I  am chasing after my graduate degree in philosophy of religion after completing an undergraduate in religious studies. I recently wrote a peer-reviewed paper on whether God is the First Cause. Philosophy of religion and philosophical theology are two academic disciplines that utilize the philosophical method for examining the evidence for God and examining the truth claims of religion. Top universities throughout the world have departments that specialize in it.  Some of the best scholarship is coming out of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Notre Dame, Princeton, Harvard, Duke, etc.  After years of study, I have come down on the side for the existence of God. 

With that said it is a caricature of God that so many are rightly railing against. I would be against that God as well. One can have an informed and mature belief in God without succumbing to the childish, fideistic, meme worthy, Dawkins descriptions.

"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","I was brought up in a small town in northwest Florida around super conservative family and culture. But when I reached high school age I started to pull away from religion, but still thought conservative, free market crap was cool, so I considered myself a libertarian. In 2008 I was pretty into Ron Paul, and even dabbled over to the Alex Jones side of the internet when he was still raving about 9/11, but I never went completely in. By 2012-2015 I'd say I had become pretty mainstream lib, mainly because the right had really began to go off the deep end, and I was still pretty politically illiterate at the time. The 2016 election is what really started to push me further left as Bernie got more recognition and I began to understand politics a little more. I also had made the decision to go back to school to pursue a poli-sci degree (graduating this summer at 32 yay!).  

I can't point to many concrete things that made me shift left. I just know when I was in my chud phase I was also listening to a lot of early Patton Oswalt, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, and reading some Hunter Thompson. So the seed were getting planted. I also have to give credit to Bill Maher, as much as he annoys me now, for pulling me away from becoming a full on chud around 2008-2011. ",1525133058

"Mangamakers","t5_304ua","There have been a couple good comments here, so I'll just tack on my two cents.

A goal, by definition, is an end point which perpetuates a person's effort to succeed. It is the highest target of a person's desires, and is the object of their continued effort. Essentially it's the purpose that drives a person for a lifetime of effort. 

A goal can literally be anything. Like the others said, it could be defeating the demon king, proving oneself to everybody, mastering cooking, becoming the strongest hero and shield of the people, mastering laziness, etc. It completely depends on what you're going for and what your character wishes to do.

The best thing about a goal is they can be as broad as you want them to be. It is that extremely far off mountain that needs to be scaled. For main characters, the goal is like the finish line. It is the culmination of all the hard work that they put forth. Every triumph, every failure, every challenge - all of these come together to allow them to achieve their goal. 

My biggest tip for coming up with a goal is pretty simple. Just make a goal and justify it through the character's actions. The really important part isn't so much what the main character wishes to achieve, but rather how they do it. 

At least for this part, split the goal up into much more reasonable objectives that the main character does in order to reach their goal. I'll use the example of Luffy now. His goal is extremely simple: become Pirate King. How does he do this? By finishing a set of objective along the way. Objectives like find a pirate crew, defeat that bad guy, get a new ship, escape jail, etc. Each of these ""arc"" objectives will have a different set of trials and tribulations required to succeed. He may have to make a new move, find a new crew mate, etc. 

Here's another example off the top of my head: a computer hacker wants to be the best hacker in the world. So good that he can hack into any server or database without anybody knowing. That's the goal. How is he going to achieve this goal? Practice his hacking skills, maybe get a really good computer, and get a crew to help him along the way. He will probably have rivals along the way to push him forward. How will he defeat these rivals? He might need to discover a brand new hacking algorithm or design a revolutionary program. And there are bound to be enemies along the way. The police, the security of the country, etc. How is he going to pass these obstacles in order to become the number one hacker on the planet? 

Try just making whatever you want. The worst that happens is you've written something. And because I'm not a professional, use what you like :)",1525133059

If you're looking to progress your attributes in terms of strength and hypertrophy \(i.e. get stronger and/or bigger\), I'd ditch the bodyweight program altogether and hop onto a resistance training program that utilizes your gym's equipment. Now that you have more tools to use \- barbells, cables, a suite of free weights, etc. \- you can load your movement patterns far more intensely.

If your goal is to develop peak strength, there are plenty of powerlifting programs to choose that focus on progressively loading barbell patterns. If you're looking for hypertrophy work, you can consider bodybuilding\-style options. I'm a big fan of barbell\-centric programs that incorporate tons of accessory/assistance work, kind of like a hybrid of the two.

Six days a week should be plenty\-intense. The fatigue should be real. In the end, you can find a way to incorporate your bodyweight movements as assistance work to any powerlifting or bodybuilding program; just adjust for volume and intensity.",1525133059

"funny","t5_2qh33","Yeah, there’s a lot of problems with a flat earth. Let’s entertain the idea for a moment, just to see what happens.

If the earth is flat, what shape is it and what are it’s dimensions?

Does it have a thickness?

If it has a thickness, what is it like internally? Are there layers? Is it all homogeneous? How thick is it?

Like you said, what’s on the other side?

How do seasons, or even daylight work?

With science, we could answer all of these questions through observation if it were true that the earth was flat. Flat earthers believe the world of science thinks they’re infallible. The truth is that what we know to be true is only known to the best of our ability. Science is a process. The old ideas are tossed when new ones demonstrate a clearer picture of reality.

Furthermore, what would be the motivation for the powers that be to pull the wool over your eyes on this topic? A spherical earth model doesn’t make anyone money.

Lastly, my beef with flat earthers is that, instead of conducting experiments to get to the bottom of this problem and see for themselves, they just make shit up. I guarantee, some flat earther, after seeing this comment will see my questions and say “that’s easy. It’s round with a radius of uh, a million miles.

"DissidiaFFOO","t5_dw4n2","Reposing this from the tail end of last thread so I can get a bit more of feedback. I am looking for advice on future pulling and party composition.

I intend to pull on the following banners: **Terra**/**Seymour** &gt; **Vaan**/**Ashe** &gt; **Squall**(70cp)/**Selphie** &gt; **Vaan**(70cp). For a while it seemed like a winning plan since it leaves a smaller room to get bankrupt on gems, but I noticed some potential problems:

* Ashe and Selphie having interlapping Max BRV Up buffs, probably meaning they don't have much synergy with each other. Much is being said about unique and non-unique buffs and I couldn't find on the info on Altema or DissidiaDB if it applies here.
* Too few physical attackers (only Squall) and too many magical attackers (basically everyone else including the supports). Can't tell if this might pose a problem.
* No debuffs other than Seymour's for a really long time.
* Not pulling for the Terra 70cp until it's in a better banner or expecting to pull all of Squall's weapons (have none at the moment) from the Selphie banner. As someone who only pulled hard on the first Vaan banner I could use some general pulling tips.
* Perhaps a bias in my plans towards big DMG characters with low skill uses (Squall/Vaan) making things hard for me on long tortuous battles like the ones on the Lost Chapters.

Since my plans aren't set in stone I wonder if you can recommend some characters to add or drop from my pulling schedule, solving some of the problems I noticed or some others I couldn't figure out yet.

So a police officer who is stationed near reservations is going to end up forming some generalizations due to the nature of the people he interacts with. This is of course racist, just like a commuter getting mad at another driver and going ""of course is an Asian woman driver"" when he sees the identity of the other driver. People are racist. But so long as we're aware of that then we can also be aware of the fact that our lived experience do not make up the whole of reality and just because these are our experiences does not mean we treat other differently because of it.

Additionally, Khamenei is one of the most radical world leaders right now and I’m sure the second he gets a nuke, world tensions will rise unlike anytime since the Cold War. People seem to mistake that Iran’s Government is some secular entity that is unlike any of the other governments in the Middle East. The people are probably more secular than their Middle Eastern counterparts but their government sure as hell ain’t (it ain’t called an Islamic Republic for nothing).

If he didnt mean to be insulting he would have said he was unable to accept the offer because of his other responsibilities. But he didnt. He said it would be waste of his time. Which it would be.  ",1525133063

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; You're missing multiple points. For one thing, if people are unarmed, you only need to order soldiers to quell an angry mob. That's a lot easier than ordering them to engage a group of their own countrymen in combat. At that point a lot of soldiers would likely be questioning the order.
&gt; 

But this is ignoring fx Ukraine upraising brought up elsewhere here. It wasn't the guns but a lot of people and some rioting.

&gt;Secondly, just the knowledge that citizens could put up some type of resistance is a huge deterrent for any government faction that might get the idea to take power unelected, or refuse to step down.

I don't get that at all. But I am not brought up in a gun-loving culture. If you look at real life insurgencies it is either almost gun-free (enough people) or it is civil war with heavy military weaponry involved.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Bandana Waddle Dee.

1. Unique moveset potential. A spear user hasn't been in smash yet and adding him to the game brings something new to the table. You can also keep it interesting by mixing in other things such as his parasol, punches and maybe even beam. SSF2 is probably the best example of how great his moveset can be. He would be a way more interesting spear user than any character from Fire Emblem in my opinion.
2. Popularity. He's really popular over in Japan, as Kirby is a way bigger series over there. And over here in other regions his popularity has grown. I see him a lot more in newcomer discussion and on peoples personal Smash rosters than during Smash 4 early discussion. He's not as popular as say King K or Wolf, but he definitely has a presence.
3. Relevancy, this is the biggest reason I personally like him over any other Kirby character. He actually does stuff in the Kirby series. He's basically appeared in every Kirby game since Return to Dreamland and has a active role in the series. He has filled a role that was severely lacking in the Kirby series, a friend for Kirby. Every friend Kirby has is either a rival \(King Dedede or Meta Knight\) or they don't even appear as much anymore \(Gooey, Animal Friends and etc\). Bandana Waddle Dee has basically become the Luigi to Kirby's Mario. In Star Allies he's the first dream friend that is introduced. He's become the 4th main character of Kirby. Marx is a character who we haven't really seen since Kirby Super Star Ultra in 2008 and only recently we see him because he was introduced as DLC. Bandana Waddle Dee has a active role in his series that doesn't seem like it will be stopping anytime soon.

Bandana Waddle Dee is a character who is portrayed as a more underdog character in his series. He's been described as constantly trying to improve himself and prove his worth as a character. He's not just a Waddle Dee, he's THE Waddle Dee. The Waddle Dee who is able to fight alongside Kirby and help him throughout his journey. The Waddle Dee who constantly appears in the series and has a active role. The Waddle Dee who has made a name for himself.  I'm kinda being cringey when I say this but it would be a success story. A underdog character who has worked hard in his series. Working his way up from being a small fry character all the way up to becoming the 4th most important character in the series. With it all culminating into him getting in his Smash. A sorta video game character underdog story. GIVE HIM HIS PRIZE.",1525133063

&gt; 14 Iran will fully implement the ""Roadmap for Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues"" agreed with the IAEA, containing arrangements to address past and present issues of concern relating to its nuclear programme as raised in the annex to the IAEA report of 8 November 2011 (GOV/2011/65).

[link](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/245317.pdf)

Then from the 8.11.11 report (GOV/2011/65):

&gt; 39 The Board of Governors has called on Iran on a number of occasions to engage with the Agency on the resolution of all outstanding issues in order to exclude the existence of possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme.

&gt; 34 In resolution 1929 (2010), the Security Council reaffirmed Iran’s obligations to take the steps required by the Board of Governors in its resolutions GOV/2006/14 and GOV/2009/82,
and to cooperate fully with the Agency on all outstanding issues, particularly those which give rise to concerns about the possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme, including by providing access without delay to all sites, equipment, persons and documents requested by the Agency.

&gt; 35 Since August 2008, Iran has not engaged with the Agency in any substantive way on this matter.""


There's a lot more there to go through, but basically Iran did not provide the requested information about the military scope of its nuclear program, and ~~still~~ ~~denies~~ ~~IAEA~~ access to military sites (correction - it said it would deny access, but the IAEA hasn't actually requested access and instead compromised for receiving samples provided by Iranian personnel for their inspections) - which is quite understandable, but still in odds with that and other parts of the JCPOA.

The process of coming up with a great idea will always be easy (and is undoubtedly easiest in retrospect) but you’re inherently linking the ideation process to success without acknowledging that the hard part (the reason you ‘missed out’) is the gulf between. Execution is the only thing that matters, and it will always be hard. 

In fact, I’d argue that this wave of disruptive technologies and collective knowledge significantly lowered the barriers to starting the process of execution (your point), which actually made it MUCH harder to succeed because the volume and velocity of competition has never been higher. 

You didn’t miss out because you couldn’t identify trends in real time and hit on an idea that in all likelihood had some legs. You missed out because you never took your idea beyond an intangible spark to something capable of delivering real value to the world.",1525133066

I was brought to tears every time Shannon sang (she reminds me of one of my best friends) and you were, without a doubt, the strongest voice in the competition. 

We referred to the two of you as Adele and Pink, btw.  

I’m still trying to get over it (I want to follow your example), but every week something will happen that will make me say “Oh, but you sent *Effie* home???” My husband just laughs at me and makes me admit that I’m still bitter. 

That said, of the remaining contestants, Maddie, Cade, and Caleb are our favorites. I almost hope that Cade doesn’t win, but only because I think that he will have a better career outside of the AI winner’s contract (he reminds me of Daughtry, who had a much better career than that season’s winner). Maddie is truly something special and I can’t help but smile every time she’s on stage. That girl has a gift. 

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to post here and communicate with your fans. I hope that you have a huge, successful career because you deserve it. My husband compared your voice to Pink (one of his favorite singers) and I thought you had an almost effortless power to your voice that reminded me of *my* favorite singer: Kelly Clarkson. Good luck to you, Effie. I’ll be watching out for your first album. :) ",1525133067

ID is problematic. You only get half XP doing ID on yourself so it takes two characters to get the most out of it. It also can't be fully done AFK with macros.

Medical XP is a pain since even a MDoc has an 80k XP cap. So you almost have to have an action burner near the village and grind out there to make it work.

Merchant might be okay but I haven't tried it. Only reason I say this is the merchant doesn't have to do anything other than set up vendors. They get XP for vendor clicks which I think can be done with a macro. So your merchant can sit out in the village for 30 days at a time. 

If you want to actively grind it out I think capping out both scouting and trapping would be pretty easy to do at the same time as a ranger. Alternatively Wilderness survival can be done completely AFK so you could mix it up between the two approaches.

Hey, want to go look at how many Dems voted against this?  Or against actual immigration reform when it came up in 2009?


&gt;You are ignoring that they don't get dictatorial powers when they are ""in charge"". The GOP threatened to filibuster everything for 8 years and the Democrats didn't have a supermajority for the vast majority (in fact, due to Kennedy's health, they really only had it for a month). 

You realize they can change the rules of the senate at will right?  And that they did have a supermajority for a time and simply refused to use it?

Because that's the basic fact.  If you have the caucus strength to pass things, but claim you don't have the votes, then it is a choice by your party not to take up action on an issue.  

When they had the power, this is how they used it - by refusing to act on the issues you say they are in favor of.

I wanted Ronald Jones and I'm glad hes our RB. I thought/think saquon is vastly overrated and this once in a generation rb talk was nonesense. He's not on Zeke or Fournette's level. RoJo is every bit the back Barkley is. We got a steal with him.

The CBs. While Stewart was head scratching, he looks to be extremely versatile. I know the FO has said they want him at CB first but I think we move him to safety. His tape has SS written all over it. Davis is the type of CB we've needed for a while. A tall physical ball hawk. I've seen some lofty comparisons to Peters and young Sherman and if that's the case we got a steal.

I love the move up to grab Cappa. Kid looks nasty and was the perfect spot to add OL depth. He's the perfect project OL that isn't a reach. I think he'll start by year 2.

The Safety pick... I would have like Evans teammate Armani Watts that late from A&amp;M but I'll have to trust the scouts on this one. Whitehead seems like a hitter hopefully we lucked out here like in past 4th rounds that gave us Kwon and Beckwith.

The WR out of Penn seems like another under the radar dude who will stick. We probably will keep only 5 WR maybe 6 now. I think him and Bobo as our 5th and 6th receivers is nice depth.

The Lb out of wisky seems like a solid depth pick if he stays healthy he has potential. I don't know if he'll make the team but he seems like another work my ass off type dude that always helps teams. Most likely a special teams dude but we need them too.


Like I said  before I wasn't a huge fan of our picks at the time. After reading up on some players I see the FOs reasoning behind most all of them. I'd give our draft a B+ right now and a potential of an A if all the picks make the team",1525133071

Like for example, telling him not to play DeSu1 because the story is like classic megaten, but for all we know that might really appeal to him. Maybe he didn't get far enough into SMT4 to get into the alignment stuff and something like DeSu1 would draw him in more and give him a chance to experience it.

Basically, /u/kosnic71, tell us more about what you are looking for in megaten games. What did you like about P3-5 and what parts of SMT4 did you like and which did you not? What did you think of things like gameplay, story, and characters in each of those games and what are you looking for in your next? How far did you get in SMT4?",1525133073

It doesn't debunk that it was a cause of Western Roman Empire's collapse.

&gt;The first thing the Christians did when they came to power in Rome was to abolish institutionalized slavery.

Rome didn't abolish slavery (AFAIK). There was a decline in slavery, but it wasn't abolished. Also, serfdom wasn't much better.

A funny thing to bring up as well, is the fundamentalists in the States who largely defended slavery. The only fundamentalist group that I can think of for the abolishment of slavery were the Quakers (who are the liberals in their ""group"").",1525133074

It is believed to have been amassed during 2015 by political consultant Ian Warren, before he passed it on in a series of detailed briefings and a postcode targeting spreadsheet in early 2016.

&gt;He first met with Cambridge Analytica to discuss the use of the information as part of Leave.EU’s campaign at the end of 2015.

&gt;Warren was head-hunted by Labour for the 2015 election campaign after his successful work with UKIP and continued to be closely associated with the party, polling members and working with Owen Smith on his leadership challenge during the remainder of 2016.

&gt;Leave.EU’s Andy Wigmore said: “He ran Ed Milliband’s team and the general election campaign in 2015 for the Labour Party. He was and still is the Labour Party guru.” A self-taught statistician and political consultant, Warren trades under the name Election Data Limited, based in Bolton.

&gt;When asked whether he was still working for the Labour Party at the time of the leak, Warren said: “I’m sick of speaking to journalists about this. I’ve nothing to say.”

&gt;When asked whether he had the right to retain and use the data, Warren terminated the phone call.

It says your Orange Pi PC recommends a psu of 2A and 5V, but from what I remember of the chinese seller listings they even recommend a 3A power supply. See what your use case power draw is. 

Based on that I think it draws from 10 Wh to 15 Wh. Now ask yourself how many hours you want to run it for and multiply accordingly. You are probably going to want a small solar array with a decent enough power bank that you build yourself. That's where my thinking is going.

In this case, the premise of the game is wrong in the first place as it's advertised as 'for everyone' while its rules are ridiculously complicated and you have to trust to trainer to instruct you well, which, given the astounding quality of some fakes (or the convolutedness of some of the rules), is not the basic due diligence you present it as. Which is fine if you only want the players with great knowledge to play, but then you have no right to accuse others of snobbery.

If you don't follow this sport, what right do you have to decide how it should be played?

No. It's like compliments - don't give fake ones, but genuinely try to think of something you admire about a company. If you really cannot think of anything at all, just be honest - ""Look, I have bought a house and have a wive and three kids counting on me. I might not be the most enthusiastic about your company, but I love my family more than anything and will give my all to give them the life they deserve. Give me the chance to prove it and your gains will be immenent."" If you're a sap ""...and your company will be like family to me, too.""

&gt;Do you think doping should be illegal, in addition to violating a sport's regulations?

No, why would it? Just like with any enhancing substance, communicate the risks clearly, sell the product as advertised and you're good.

"anime","t5_2qh22","yeah, the fight can be interesting, especially in the right circumstances. Good storytelling is all about throwing incredible odds against the protagonist, like a lot of those Batman stories where he fights Superman.

this sadly wasn't really that tale. [Avengers vs X-Men Versus](http://marvel.com/comics/series/16230/avengers_vs_x-men_versus_2011_-_2012) wasn't billed as some great narrative. It was just a fight book. While the main story was going on in [Avengers vs X-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_vs._X-Men) this was merely just a place to see some of the individual fights that aren't narratively important but can be fun to watch. (Red) Hulk vs (Colossus) Juggernaut. Storm vs Black Panther. Psylock vs Daredevil.

Iron Man vs Magneto.

which is part of where the problem is. this is suppose to be an unbias and fair battle match. This isn't David vs Goliath, because there shouldn't be a 'Good Guy' or 'Bad Guy' in this situation. Both sides are right. 

but it never came across that way. This was during 2012 when the Avengers were at their peak and Marvel was beginning the downplaying of the X-Men in favor of Inhumans. A lot of X-Men fans felt shafted.

V8 requires timing belt and water pump changed every 90k, at roughly $1200 given what others reported. Also 4x4 models is AWD (4hi all the time.) their main purpose is for towing, up to 7300lbs (2wd models) 7000lbs 4x4 models. 

V6 is timing chain (last lifetime of engine. Pretty much 350+k) part time 4x4 (can be driven in 4hi all the time if center isn't locked) has a 5000lb tow rating. 

Both engines provide same acceleration speed. V8 is just more torquey obviously. 

Either or are very solid and dependable engines. V8 will go a long long time, given it was cared for. Same v8 in the 4th gen 4runners http://www.trucktrend.com/features/1607-toyota-buys-victor-sheppards-million-mile-2007-tundra/

But the 4.0 v6 are earning a reputation as well. Some owners are clocking in at above 350k currently. 

As long as it was cared for. You couldn't really go wrong with either engine option. V6 is good enough for most. And less overall maintanance (because of the timing chain and water pump being outside the engine) but can't tow as much, like the v8 model can. 

03-04 v8 models didn't have vvti originally so HP was actually less then the v6 models. 236hp. But torque was higher. 05-09 get vvti so it bumps it to 270hp, but drops its original torque. Tow capacity was the same either way. 

But, with your budget, you are looking at a clean 3rd gen with roughly 150k. Or 03-04 4th gen with around 125k. 

Before I forget, 03-04 v6 were 4spd. V8 was always 5spd. 

Hope this little rambling comment helps you out some. Good luck.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","My pleasure, thank you for responding!

You're right, the lack of specificity really makes it hard to get a very good sense for how an individual will respond - we're nowhere near the specificity that would be needed for engineering, at least on an individual basis.

Regarding your question about random assignment, and your skepticism of stats with the last election, it is good to be skeptical. Most research relies on inferential statistics, where we extrapolate from a sample to what might be going on in the population. With this extrapolation, there's always the chance that we're wrong. If we say that two groups are different from each other, but they're really not, we've made what's called a type I error (we said we found something interesting when nothing was going on). If we think the two groups aren't different but they really are, we made a type II error. All of this is built on with inferential statistics, so we have probabilities mapped out really well, and generally set our error rate to be 5%, 1%, or .1%. This means if there really was no difference between the groups, we'd still say we found something interesting 5%, 1%, or .1% of the time. 

Regarding the Stanford Prison Study, the idea was that this was a demonstration of the power of the situation. The claim was that even regular Stanford students could be made to act in very terrible ways for the guards. 

There were a number of issues with this study, but one of them that most people don't know is that there is a good chance that there was a bias in terms of who ended up in the study. Around a decade ago, someone used similar recruitment materials to get some participants for ""a study on prison life"". People who were interested in this type of study, compared to a control study, scored higher on aggressiveness, Machiavellianism, narcissism and social dominance, and were generally less empathetic and altruistic. These are traits that would likely predispose someone towards conforming to how the participants behaved in the study. This means that your caution about extrapolating theses results to people in general is well-founded.  ",1525133078

I had to  take responsibility and help myself. The book I mentioned, (which I don't give a shit if you read or not, I was just trying to help), was the book that helped me understand and change the way I eat. And yes, I have been colitis free for over 4 years (I suffered with it for 11 years before that), as I no longer have any of the awful symptoms. If I was to return to my old diet tomorrow, I wouldn't expect to still be free of symptoms, I know they would come back. That's what stops me from doing it.

There may be small branches not illustrated, as others have told you. Additionally, very small nerves are not identifiable visually in some if not most of the cases during surgery. They do not look like the structures of well embalmed and dissected cadavers that you may have seen pictures of. Most of the time even large nerves are surrounded by tissues that look very similar. Surgeons have to be cautious while working in areas that they know contain nerves.

I can completely understand your point of us wanting a child with our brother as a selfish act yet it is our right to make despite the view points and opinions of others. We ultimatly decided agianst it at this time and maybe it is the thought of a family that we both have our hearts set on.

"Cricket","t5_2qhe0","&gt;  T20 is just too short a format to get specialist keepers.

How do you reckon? Since T20 only has 120 balls you would expect your top six to perform while batting and let wicket keeper do his job. Especially in case of SRH whose home ground is not very batting friendly you can't evaluate the wicketkeeper on his batting alone. Saha has been exceptional wicketkeeper if you watch SRH games. In their defense where every run is important he has saved a lot. A good wicketkeeper or even a fielder is worth much more in T20 than longer format because percentage of time batsmen try to steal run or bowlers bowl wayward line and length is much higher. I would argue that having a specialist keeper in T20 cricket is more important and Saha has been instrumental to his teams performances.",1525133083

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","FNC has a somewhat similar style to RNG, where the main focus/carry is their botlane. As alluded by Rekkles during World's, RNG simply has Uzi and FNC doesn't. If you have watched most of this split. Uzi has been pretty much playing above anything he has shown in the past, including last World's.   

FNC will need to rely on the other lanes/jungle to win or neutralize the bot difference. Unfortunately for FNC, both Xiaohu and Mlxg have been very good during all of LPL playoffs. They are also some of the best players in their positions that the LPL has ever produced. Macro wise, RNG can close out games very fast. Once they get a lead or Baron, it's generally game over. The strength of RNG is both in wave management and general skirmish/team fighting. 

Their P/B is generally what most people criticize RNG for and should be the main focus of FNC. A lot of the time they would just draft multiple losing lanes with no clear win condition. Their main carries, Uzi/Xiaohu, has some of the deepest champion pools in the LPL and can't really be banned out. I definitely think FNC needs to focus on shutting down Mlxg and not give away something like Kaisa or Sion to win. In Bo1, anything can happen, and it should be quite close if FNC has a favourable draft.    ",1525133085

Frankly I am as well. But we can yell at the wall however much we want, and that won't change anything.

The Mechs sentience is not contained in any hard-drive-like system, instead the mech-mind functions much like a human nervous system.  A large network of circuitry, that provides the dual function of supplying power, is spread through-out the Mech. The network sends information along with energy in order to create consciousness. Nodes at the limbs or guns or functional groups provide fine control. The nodes can also gate the levels of fuel needed for specific functions, increasing efficiency.  Node systems would also allow for increased size (like in dinosaurs). The level of intelligence for this kind of system would depend on where you think consciousness resides and what kind of code/leve of programming is running through our body circuitry. These mechs might be more reactionary or simple organism like than anything else.  ",1525133089

I just want to point out that this is standard Pakatan propaganda.  They've used this since 1998 when Anwar got booted out of UMNO.  Back then, they went very quickly from ""Anwar is the devil incarnate like all UMNO top brass"" to ""Anwar is a saint because he is no longer in UMNO"".  And if you've read Shannon Ahmad's sorry and embarassing excuse for satire *Sh!t*, this becomes even more explicit: the Anwar analogue in the story gets ejected out of the body of the Malaysia analogue, gets exposed to the sun, and literally becomes purified.

&amp;nbsp;

**Glove Rushes**

I like the block and initial punch nerfs, however with them, I don't think damage overall needs to be nerfed, because they are now reactable, and punishable. MAYBE only the nade and roaster by 30-40 dmg, but I don't theink their damage needs to be nerfed if you take away what made them so great in the first place.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tri Arms**

I dont think the uncharged damage of the tri arms are what need to be nerfed. Uncharged they can alreay be taken out with just one punch. Not sure damage reduction would make that big of a difference. I still think making them slower and much risker if you somehow manage to miss (moreso Triblast) is the way to go about nerfing these ARMS

&amp;nbsp;

**Hammers**

Hammer do need hitbox fixes STAT, but I also feel that their actual swing to hit grounded opponents is too slow as well. As I said before, I feel like I can react to the swing startup. I dunno, maybe their are actually better than they feel to me.

&amp;nbsp;

**Missiles**

Ehh, Homie right now I feel is never used, because the seekie has bigger openings created, while the small retraction difference doesn't do much. I feel the homie should extend much fasterl so it is much more scary and threatening than the seekie. Maybe even have it retract slower, but I **really** feel it should extend quicker.

Also, for both missile ARMS, I think that they should both keep the explosion from being knocked down. It is one of the few reasons to use them at the moment. If not, I don't think their is much reason to use them...

&amp;nbsp;

**Blorb**

Blorb, yeah the explosion change is fine, but I really think it should be a lot faster. It wold really open up a lot of mindgames with its different bounces, the blind effect. If it extended much fatser, and retracted a bit faster, then I feel they would be great, but not broken

&amp;nbsp;

**Lockjaw**

Lockjaw is a weird arm... and I kinda want to keep them that way. I think that a more interesting way to buff would be to have you be able to fully control when it fires the shot and when it lunges. I would open up so much strategy and counterplay strategies, that it would be extremely exciting as an arm. Just a thought though, as of now I say keep the speed buffs, leave the unique explosion

&amp;nbsp;

**Deflect Dash**

Man, I really don't like the idea of Deflect lasting so long, especially with things like wake up pressure being basically unpunshable barring predictable grab, or if you happen to have rush.

However the main problem would be camping and running way with this deflect, Springman could now just run away using a nigh unpunishable deflect, where they can react to grab, and keep any lead for an extended period of time. Maybe have full charge be the current 16 frame version.

&amp;nbsp;

**Spring Man**

Separating my thought on the deflect changes, yeah these nerfs sound fine, and the comeback buff is very scary now.

&amp;nbsp;

**Ninjara**

Agree, but for joules's consideration on the motion control users, I say that since the joy-cons have gyro, have you move your arms horizontally while holding the block position sounds fine to me. I don't think it would cause too big an issue

&amp;nbsp;

**Mechanica**

(I still want controllable air hovering dammit) Yeah these are great though

&amp;nbsp;

**Kid Cobra**

####**OBLIGATORY DON'T TOUCH MY MAIN**. 

Haha, but yeah those Cobra changes, especially to shorthop would definitely change his gameplan slighlty, but making his cobra dashes bigger would account for that greatly. I wouldn't mind it **TOO** much.

&amp;nbsp;

**Helix**

Helix, those are some good changes, though I would personally also make him not go into puddle form if he airdashes, so his landings are much worse for him. Maybe that is too much though

&amp;nbsp;

**Misango**

After many revisions, those Misango changes look good. Just one problem now. Why would you full charge ever now?! hehe, seriously, if blocking and the pillar are so much more useful, full charging would become obselete. I say put in the cylce from full charge as well, just so it isn't totally useless.

&amp;nbsp;

**Springtron**

Springtron, yeah the airdash thing sounds mostly good, however wide grabs would be his bane, because he cannot escape them with an airdash. Maybe have him be able to high jump out of it, but he is fully vulerable falling from doing this, so he can mixup better, and can avoid grabs, but cannot spam one escape option.

&amp;nbsp;

**Dr. Coyle**

Dr. Coyle, I agree with the dash speed, rush, and block invisibility changes. However, I think that the shadows being their allow for some interesting gameplay, because you can tell roughly where she is, but you really cannot tell what she is doing, so she could be above or infront, blocking or preparing to punch. It makes things much more interesting IMO than just punching blindly into the abyss or running away

However, the dematerializing, I dunno man, having to make sure you punch the correct arm would be more cumbersome than it should. Maybe having any arm cancelling deletes the third one, or just not have the third one be charged, but increase its duration. Something should be done, but I don't think that is the best thing.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lola Pop**

As for Lola Pop and Vah Ruta, I don't think having an invincible landing is the way to go about it. I say instead, have her do a super dash left, right or backwards if her shield bounce gets hit.

Also, making her be able to super dash even when not in shield is a bit too much IMO. Just have her be able to do a quick option, by not double tapping, and a large one by double tapping. It would fix what he seems to be complaining about, and keep heer main mechanic.

"TheWalkingDeadGame","t5_2tzww","Instead of looking at this issue separately, look at it as part of the larger issue, which is that the plot for a game like this has to be on rails.

The budget for these games does not allow them to make 150 hours of content, of which the typical player will only see 15 hours.  This means the game is going to go from point A to B to C to D, all the way to Z, in order, with player decision having little if any effect on the plot.

There is no way around this, besides creating large amounts of content which most players will never see, so unless the unlikely happens and these games start doing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, with players wanting to play a short game which can be replayed in a variety of ways, this will never change.

This means that all developers can do is to give players the illusion of choice.  Players can make lots of little choices, and maybe a few larger ones, but over all the game is heading down the same tracks towards the same destination, no matter what the player thought he was choosing.",1525133100

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","Ok, so I'm going to start off by saying that I actually like the safe cracking update... in concept, but the implementation is wrong...  There are only 2 reasons why a player would want to participate in content like this; XP and GP.  The content gives the best of neither and makes you work harder than other methods of training (at lower level).  


Firstly i want to talk about the stethoscope.  The fact that the buyable toolbelt version gives absolutely no upgrade and is only useful for this one training method anyway, it makes absolutely no sense to make a player grind for 5+ hours just to add it to their toolbelt.  Just make the original one toolbeltable by default.  There's no need to force compers to play low tier content just for the sake of it.


Secondly, the rewards should be tradable.  The xp is significantly lower than top training methods and it would be inefficient to train here purely for the shock absorbers since the xp rates without them are still higher at other locations, making them automatically dead content... unless they were tradable, which would actually make these a potentially good money maker for players that prefer money over top xp rates.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Thank you. As someone who moved from somewhere with a high cost of living to somewhere with a low cost of living, its amazing what a difference it can make. I currently pay $500/mo in rent for a 2 bedroom duplex (about $200/mo more than the going price of such a place in the area), meanwhile where I previously lived you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio apartment in the ghetto for less than $1k/mo.

Where I currently live, one could easily get by working at McDonald's or Walmart and have enough to put together a setup like the above in a year or two. My old town one would need 2-3 of such jobs just to live alone.

Cost of living is always something to take into account when considering someone's ability to buy stuff and their occupation",1525133102

The JCPOA text contains a dispute mechanism. What Trump has proposed doing is reimposing sanctions on Iranian entities and officials, in contravention of JCPOA Annex 2. There is no formal withdrawal protocol from the JCPOA, but ceasing to implement the deal would launch the dispute mechanism, which launches a maximum-thirty-five-day process of dispute resolution by the Joint Commission and/or an Advisory Board. If no resolution is found, then the complainant can terminate their own participation and refer the matter to the UN Security Council.

The dispute mechanism could lead to joint complaints being filed by the United States and Iran. This would obligate investigation of the complaints by the IAEA (unless anyone thinks the IAEA will just flat-out disregard an accusation of noncompliance by the US), and a resolution attempt. If Iran refused to comply with investigation of its military sites based on an American accusation, there would be grounds for that to be part of the crisis as well, and grounds to claim Iranian noncompliance with the deal too. The mechanisms to inspect military sites are absolutely relevant to whether or not the US could force an inspection by lodging its own complaint on the day Iran lodges theirs.",1525133103

The wikipedia description is short, so I'll copy it below.

The 1977–1978 Russian flu epidemic was caused by strain Influenza A/USSR/90/77 (H1N1). It infected mostly children and young adults under 23; because a similar strain was prevalent in 1947–57, most adults had substantial immunity. Because of a striking similarity in the viral RNA of both strains – one which is unlikely to appear in nature due to antigenic drift – it was speculated that the later outbreak was due to a laboratory incident in Russia or Northern China, though this was denied by scientists in those countries.[13][14][15] The virus was included in the 1978–1979 influenza vaccine.[16][17][18][19]

On a second thought. How about masks that allow the bbeg to control the npcs from afar? This would've the same benefits as the undead **but** now your bbeg can go along and ""recruit"" other important npcs in the world.

Picture the following: 

* the pcs just brought your first real boss to their knees (0 hp)
* the boss gives a comment about true power or is panicking because dead is near
* he produces a strange mask from one of his pockets and dons it in the hopes of getting more power
* And now the second half of the boss fight starts where your bbeg can introduce themselves to the pcs and mop the floor with them (make it a close fight that shows how powerful the bbeg is *even* if he doesn't have his own body)

Also if you want your pcs to really *really* hate the bbeg you could do the following:

* the pcs come back from one of the last major missions to confront the bbeg
* they see important npc #1 which they know since the campaign started standing there at a table with their back to the pcs
* the pcs great them
* the npc asks them how they've been if they are all well?
* pcs say something
* the npc tells them they did something and now they've to pay
* the npc turns around showing that they're wearing one of the masks
* the npc attacks

According to Buddhist philosophy, God and the Devil come together as one; distinctions dilute reality. He may take one guise or another to satisfy our intellect. This week I make sense of it by considering Him a Super Spirit. 

Heaven is being with Him, and I'd like to patent that... anything is possible at this point. He speaks in mantras, all about love. I'm not channeling one of those super talkative Pleiadians. So, allow me to speak on His behalf... about getting older than the universe, I'm going on 57. That means I was around for Jimi Hendrix, the Stones, my late husband, Don Alias, played percussion with Miles Davis and Dave Sanborn. I toured with him through the later Jazz era, and worked at Quad Recording studios in Times Square where Tupac got shot. I don't mind getting old - 

Hendrix said... 
Hurrah, I awake from yesterday. Alive, but the war is here to stay. So my love, Catherina and me, decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea. Not to die but to be reborn, away from lands so battered and torn. Forever, forever. Oh say, can you see it's really such a mess. Every inch of Earth is a fighting nest.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Hi guys! I want to incorporate rosehip oil into my routine because I am hoping it will help with my redness. I’m just not sure where it would fit into my current routine.

Some background: I have perpetually dry skin that sometime gets oily throughout the day in my t-zone. However, since I’ve started an actual routine, I’m having less of an oil issue. I have some acne, mostly hormonal, and lots of redness. I don’t think it’s rosacea, but I have extremely rosy cheeks all of the time, and redness above my eyebrows and on my nose. I am extremely fair and all of the pink and red shows right through my skin. I didn’t start a real routine until about 1.5 months ago, beyond whatever face wash and moisturizer was available, but this routine has been working well for me.

AM
Cleanse with Cerave hydrating facial cleanser
Thayer’s witch hazel toner
Dr Jart Cicapair serum
Dr Jart Cicapair cream
Dr Jart Cicapair color correcting treatment (this mostly behaves like a primer under my makeup or instead of makeup)

PM
Remove makeup with Garnier Micellar or whatever makeup remover I have
Cleanse with Cerave hydrating facial cleanser
Thayer’s witch hazel toner
Mario Badescu drying lotion on any blemishes
Dr Jart Cicapair serum
Dr Jart Cicapair cream
Dr Jart Cicapair nightly repair mask

Twice a week, I add a Mary Kay Vitamin C Square to my serum during my PM routine. Once or twice a week, I use the Fresh Rose Mask after cleansing and before toning in my PM routine, and then skip the Dr Jart mask. The Dr Jart products are pricey but have been an amazing help with my redness. I’d like to incorporate the rosehip oil to help, but I don’t know if I should add it to my moisturizer at night or use it instead of moisturizer, or what. Any other constructive criticism about the rest of my routine is so welcome. I’m very new to it all!",1525133108

Pretty sure Big E didn't give the okay on Abhumans (I can't remember any reference to them in the Great Crusade for example), that was probably a decision that was made later by Imperial Guard commanders...  the Sisters of Battle and the Inquisition would likely still look very poorly upon them even in the ""current"" day in the lore.

Don't eat any sugar, bread, rice, pasta, crackers, potatoes.

So, a home-made breakfast that used to be cereal with milk and a slice or toast with jam becomes some scrambled eggs with cheese and some bacon.

Lunch that was an egg salad sandwich becomes lettuce salad with egg salad on top of it.

Dinner that was batter-fried chicken and baked potato with butter, cheese and sour cream on it becomes baked chicken with skin on and mashed cauliflower with a ton of butter, cheese and sour cream on it.

I talked to my doctor and got a good amount of information that I could pass to him and he spoke to his doctor about it as well. 

Both doctors were very helpful and told me about current patients were one partner had HSV and the other did not even after being together for 15+ years not using protection. 

My SO and I decided to stay together and use protection. After maybe a year and my outbreaks were under control with medication we stopped using protection. No contact if I have an outbreak ect...It has now been 10+ years together and he is still negative. Not saying you should not use protection or anything just wanted to let you know you can have a very normal relationship with someone who is neg if they are open and well educated about the virus. 

Your ex may just not be testing positive yet. He should get tested every couple of months if he did have those symptoms just to make sure. Have your other and his other partners been tested as well? That's how I found out who gave it to me.

Rather, we were encouraged to look to elders for guidance.  That’s a recipe for disaster when a POS wants to exploit the naive. 

Then there’s the “do unto others” deal that is not always reciprocated in the real world. I was told that if I was good and righteous, others would return the favor. This led to a lot of confusion and heartbreak. 

I’m in a good spot these days but it took a LONG time. I no longer feel like I’m wearing an “easy target” sign on my back and the resentment I’ve held has faded. Life is good on the other side, even if I get the stick eye in public when I wear a tank top hehe. ",1525133117

"space","t5_2qh87","In a perfect world, you would make Mars off limits until you could send multiple robotic landers to explore as much as possible for life before allowing any human landings. 

But this is not a perfect world.

One could argue, and I will, that most robotic landers we could send there would not have nearly the capability that we would need to fully explore for life. With solar radiation, it’s highly unlikely that we would find many signs of life close to the surface and would have to drill and take core samples in ice to find protected areas. And with core samples you could have protected samples that are free of contamination. It would also be a much easier process with having humans to do the work and examine the samples on Mars. 

This wouldn’t even be a topic of discussion if we weren’t actually getting close to sending people. Sometimes it seems like we need to come up with reasons not to go, but if NASA had a mission, I’m pretty sure they would find their anti contamination protocols sufficient enough. ",1525133118

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","... Turns out a lifetime of breaking people leads to a remarkable talent for fixing them up.
My name is James Bonelle - or you may know me as Jimmy Bones, miracle doctor. 

It all started with a fellow named Bensnict Cucumber... Or something like that. My employer had hired me to kill him for triple my normal fee. I typically try to avoid personal interaction with the target but, for the extra cost, I thought I should make a special effort. 

I met him on the train, the 8:22AM to London to be exact. It was the train he always got. I figured I would wait for him to go to the bathroom and then use my piano wire as he moved into an empty enough space. Turns out an easier opportunity presented itself. Halfway through the journey he cracked his neck to the side. 
""Need some help there?"" I asked him, looking around briefly. The carriage was nearly deserted, it would be simple to snap his neck and leave, pretending he'd fallen asleep. 
""I'm a chiropractor"" I told him, leaning over and delivering a single forceful twist. An audible crack sounded and I smirked slightly, another easy job. Then, as I got up to leave, the man I just thought I'd killed spoke to me.
""That's amazing... Thankyou so much"" 
I was taken aback, that snap should easily have killed him. It was time to leave, this guy was clearly a lot more durable than I anticipated, a sniper rifle would've been a much better call.
""Well yes, no problem, I really should be going"" I told him, standing up.

Before I knew what had happened he had referred me to his friend, a Mr Shaun Lentil, who asked for the same service. I don't know why I agreed but, for whatever reason, I did. 

Fifteen adjustments later and I'm somehow the go-to for any spinal troubles for any celebrities. The only lingering effects of my time as an assassin is my catchphrase. Whenever I'm working with someone right before a show:

IMO these are some of the most overlooked hardboiled mystery books ever (look how few reviews each book gets on Goodreads!). The books have complex but compelling plots, the characters are all engaging, the prose is on a completely different level of dark humor, and there's a ton of interesting social commentary. 

But I never see him brought up in ""best crime fiction"" recommendations. IMO Himes totally stands with the best of them -- Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, etc. -- while bringing a completely unique perspective to the genre, along with even more savage wit/humor. ",1525133120

You knew that between puberty and 25 when you married a virgin.  I guess I'll never understand why the label is so important.  Maybe you have to be asexual to get that.

&gt; But their answer was unhelpful to me and I didn't dig any farther (they said I could label myself whatever I wanted which is a sentiment I've never particularly liked to begin with).

I too find that particularly unhelpful.  Particularly since it is a capital crime there to question anyone's self identifying label (that will get you booted without a trial, and without a warning).  It is a strange, sometimes surreal community.

Your wife has sexual desire but is perfectly happy not to have sex, at all.  Or once a year, which is as close to not at all as you can get.  That is a tough one too, for me.  I'm surprised she didn't go for the gray label.  Isn't that what it's for?

Keep in mind that you came in questioning my ""never"", which was strictly applied to the OP.  And I think it is fair to assume that if she were like your wife, she would not be posting here.  This is what I said:

""***You*** (OP) will never make a relationship with an asexual work. ""

I said that without considering that she also said this:  

&gt; I've intellectually accepted that I'm going to be celibate for the second half of my life. I just need to get my emotions on board.

I'm sure I've read over 1,000 stories here.  That is a new one for me.  And keep in mind that 99% of the stories here are basically Ground Hog Day, over and over again, with only the details changing.  That's no judgement on her, that is just me missing a very unusual, if not unique,  piece of information.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","I think parents should be allowed to screen embryos and fetuses, and think they should be informed of the option to do so. In fact I actually think there ethical problems with choosing not to do so (but none so big as to conflict with the right to bodily autonomy).

&gt;Of course not, that's stupid. Even if someone thinks abortion is immoral, parents do have the right to know how to prepare for their child and the special needs it might have.

The argument is that by allowing these screening procedures while at the same time allowing abortion/IVF, we're effectively allowing the abortion of fetuses and embryos with disabilities. I agree with you that it shouldn't be banned though. The way I see it, there's nothing wrong with preventing a life of serious disabilities from being started.

&gt;Yes. I can't imagine any scenario where informing the parents of this option would be a bad thing.

Iceland requires that all parents be informed of the option to test for Down syndrome and other disabilities in the fetus. Many have objected that by giving parents this information, the state is making the practice of aborting fetuses with Down Syndrome more common. In fairness, that is the effect. Nearly all fetuses with Down Syndrome in Iceland are aborted (it's about 98% in Denmark, but only 67% in the US). Culture also factors into it though. Iceland is very secular and the religious institutions in the country do not consider abortion murder.

&gt;Parents should have the option to do it if they want to, but I think forced genetic testing of all pregnancies would be going too far.

There's an argument that it's in the child's best interests to not be born with serious disabilities, and that a parent choosing to do IVF while forgoing PGD is tantamount to choosing to forgo vaccination. It puts the child at risk of a serious, potentially painful and/or life-shortening disease/disability. 

Also as far as prenatal testing, invasive tests are only conducted when less invasive screening procedures find a high probability that something is wrong, precisely because of the non-zero risk of complication that you pointed out. There is an argument for requiring that women be fully informed about the implications that continuing their pregnancy will have on themselves and their potential. With that said, there are obviously some parents who don't want to know. 

It would obviously be going way too far to require or pressure women into aborting disabled fetuses, as that would basically be eugenics and would completely violate the woman's right to bodily autonomy. That said, not allowing a damaged embryo which would lead to a lifetime of disability and suffering to be implanted into a woman is obviously not comparable to forcing a woman into an abortion.

I should take this time to note that many disability rights activists would profoundly object to any possibility of aborting fetuses for disabilities. They'd argue this de-values the lives of those who live with disabilities, that this is eugenics, and this murder, that we shouldn't try to determine ""who's life is worth living"" etc. Many oppose doctor assisted suicide for the same reason. I realize this touches deep nerves, but I respectfully disagree with them. As someone who has both a chronic disease and a psychological disorder I of course want every person with disabilities to be treated with the utmost respect and to get the help they need.

But embryos and fetuses in the first two trimesters aren't persons, they're a collection of cells without a functioning brain or the capacity for suffering. All things being equal, if you can have a healthy happy child instead of a sick suffering child, you should do the former. Furthermore, the woman obviously has the right to bodily autonomy and you can't force anyone to continue a pregnancy. 

&gt;I'm not sure about this one.
I'm not sure either. 
I think it's perfectly obvious that it's a reprehensible, sexist, and downright barbaric practice that should be unthinkable in a civilized gender-equal society. I also think the state has a very legitimate interest in ensuring that the gender ratio between men and women remains in balance. In China and India, this is a very serious issue. At the same time, if allowing prenatal sex-selective abortion prevents some reprehensibly sexist parents from commiting infanticides, that really makes you think. Then again, does allowing it normalize this kind of sexism?

Absent this rampant sexism and lopsided sex-ratio, allowing it would obviously be convient for parents who want to paint the nursery pink or blue in advance. On the other hand, banning it would certainly send a statement that society thinks gender shouldn't matter in determining human worth.",1525133122

Why? Well, because then they might have to explain **all** of their ridiculously fascist restrictions on clothing (and other things, I'm sure) from that same perspective. School administrators have a vested interest in reserving the power to eliminate the source rather than discipline the mob, even when it's completely unfair to do so.

SCOTUS, meanwhile, is not interested in making that hardline decision, either.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","very interesting.

for those who can't access the site for some reason.

&gt;It's come to my attention that there is a lot of concern in the community about the direction of my Gravlev simulation. I can certainly understand this considering that it went out in 3.0 in a completely broken state. Many people have questioned my approach for the system without having the opportunity to see how it behaves when functioning as intended. And until 3.2 comes out (unless we can get it into a 3.1 patch), most people won't have an opportunity to experience a fully functional Gravlev. So until that time, I'd like to take the opportunity to discuss how Gravlev is expected to function and also answer any questions and hear concerns that people might have. In general, my expectation for Gravlev is that it will function somewhere in the region between ""ridiculous bouncy balloon"" and a faked, collision-driven vehicle, preferably closer to the latter than the former. Whether I'm using ""hidden wheels"" or the system I created, the vehicle is essentially traveling on a spring-based suspension. The main difference between my model and a traditional suspension between the vehicle and the wheels, or essentially between the vehicle and the ground, is that I'm actively driving the spring's properties to elevate the vehicle to a goal elevation, rather than merely relying on a static damped spring system to allow the vehicle to ride on a cushion over the terrain. 

&gt;Because of this, my model has a component to it that most hover sims don't, which is determining what elevation we want the vehicle to take. I use raycasts to gather data about the ground under the vehicle, and also oncoming terrain, but I could just as easily use a physics collision mesh to gather this data. I felt that the raycast approach could be more efficient, but if it can't provide a sufficient resolution of data for the Gravlev to function properly, of course I'll adapt. But this question is entirely about how I get data about the terrain, not about how the model uses that data to elevate the vehicle. So as you're hovering along, there is a designated hover height that the Gravlev control system wants to maintain. This is set per bike by the tuners. The Nox wants to sit very low, because it's basically a street bike. The Dragonfly is a bit higher because it's more of an off-roader. But based on this desired elevation and the reading of the terrain under the vehicle, the Gravlev control system will attempt to maintain a given height above ground. It does so with the same kind of spring you'd have on a wheeled suspension, only this is a more stable and adaptive spring simulation than a static mass-spring-damper system. At any moment I can indicate what elevation I want, how long I want to take getting to that elevation, what I want my maximum rising velocity to be, as well as what I want my maximum rising acceleration to be. This allows designers to tune a hover vehicle for a wide range of capabilities, from a street bike that struggles on rough terrain, to a cruising bike that's meant to hover mostly over moderately rough terrain, to an offroader that's meant to feel every bump. In the first and second modes, it will feel very much like a Star Wars hover bike, which you generally only see over reasonably flat terrain. For the last case, it's going to feel more like a small boat or jetski, and it should because my model shares a lot in common with buoyancy in water. But again it's highly configurable so designers can hopefully get a lot of different behaviors out of it, depending on the goals for a particular bike or other hover vehicle. 

&gt;Using this system, I have a lot more control over the hovering behavior than I would with a traditional damped spring system. For example, if the bike is falling from a high elevation, I can calculate at which point I need to turn on the hover (spring) in order for it to arrest the falling velocity and return to the desired hover height, just avoiding a hard collision with the ground. A more traditional spring-based system would just rely on the spring having reached its limits and you bounce up with a hard collision. Traditional spring simulations aren't this adaptable and predictable.

&gt;Because of this approach I've taken of maintaining a goal elevation and driving the hover vehicle up to that elevation, or allowing it to settle back down to it if it's too high, the sense that the vehicle is too floaty or bouncy depends a lot on the logic that's used to set that elevation. And that's still a work in progress. The latest Evocati test build feels like it's coming along well. But the choice of elevation in no way determines how well the vehicle can react to changes in elevation. The system is very stable and adaptive and can achieve the goal motion very well. The key is defining the best goal elevation to take as the vehicle moves along at potentially very high speeds over unpredictable terrain. And that's an important consideration for a system like this. It isn't limited to designated tracks in the game. It can go anywhere. So it needs to be able to handle a very diverse set of conditions. It makes no assumptions about the terrain it will be flying over. Something else to keep in mind with SC Gravlev vehicles is that they are hybrid space/hover vehicles. They do have thrusters that allow the vehicle to fly in space or in atmosphere. Just because you enter hover doesn't mean those thrusters are unusable. The goal is for hover to be more efficient because you're not expending thrust to stay aloft. If tuned and balanced properly, I expect this to make hover mode a useful option relative to atmospheric flight. Otherwise, hover will be nothing more than a novelty that will wear off quickly.",1525133135

But it really doesn't matter anyway. A 4.0 is nice and respectable and all, but it's not the end-all be-all. You're going to get into the same schools as someone with a 4.0 if you have a 3.8+ and are the same in all other areas.

When it eventually happens there’ll be a dozen of legitimate excuses, totally unrelated to Mueller (yeah right..), for his ousting and even the “liberal media” will be talking about how professional and trustworthy his replacement is (yeah right..). 

The media will never say “this replacement is going to undermine Mueller”. And then when he or she eventually does the media won’t say they are because they’ll be using legal jargon to legitimize them undermining Mueller.

Then when we’re protesting you know the media will be saying “there’s no evidence that they’re interfering with Mueller” and making us out to be drama queens. But we can combat that by good PR messages.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;I don't blame anyone for rejecting supernatural claims, but it should be based on sound methodology, not one's own presuppositions. And you risk making a logical error if you reject the existence of God because you don't believe Leprechauns exist.

I'm a methodological naturalist. This effectively means that I don't believe in the supernatural because we have no method by which we can investigate it. How can we test or measure or figure out the supernatural? The moment you figure out how to test and measure it consistently so it can be studied, I'll seriously consider dropping out of my PhD program and switching to study that. As it stands, there is absolutely no way to demonstrate the validity of supernatural claims in any way that is discernible from random chance, so I don't believe. 

&gt; To my knowledge, not a lot of people has been willing to die the most grotesque ways you can imagine, because of their belief in Leprechauns.

What about because of their belief in [their non-Christian religion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_self-immolation.jpg)? What about for their belief in the [militant spread of their ideology](http://s18694.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Suicide-Bombers.jpg)? What about those that were [mislead into believing the ridiculous](https://www.brainz.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jonestown-massacre-848x477.jpg)? 

There have been people dying for ideas for a very, very long time. [Martyrdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr) is not just the domain of Christians. And if other faiths are all wrong, that means that people can willingly die for incorrect beliefs. And if people can die for incorrect beliefs, why does the suffering of Christians serve as evidence of their beliefs? It doesn't, because Christian martyrs are just one subset of a larger group of martyrs, all of which laid down their lives for their diverse ideologies. ",1525133140

And if a toxic vaccine could actually cause autism then it stands to reason it would also cause neurological dysfunction in non-autistic people too which would have a huge societal cost, possibly comparable to the cost of not vaccinating.  It's not immediately clear which route you should take in this hypothetical scenario and I think it's really bizarre that people are making it out to be this simple.

"chess","t5_2qhr7","You're right, that gets black into a Philidor, which is yet another transposition to a respectable e4 defence.

White's main response is 4. Nf3, where white just has to be patient and happy with having a bit more central space in a fairly quiet position. There is also an endgame after 4. dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8+ which looks a bit awkward for black at first glance, but surprisingly is completely fine for him. It's enough to put a lot of people off the idea of 3... e5 though.

By ""ideal pawn centre"", all I mean is having pawns on d4 and e4 - I don't mean to imply white's winning or anything, there are lots of situations where black can get away with letting white have he centre for a while. Nonetheless, having that pawn duo generally makes it fairly straightforward to find good squares for your pieces and find stuff to do, so as a rule of thumb it's a good thing to aim for.",1525133143

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","Absolutely! Message me any time. And the apex system and 3d-printed mold on their customs are why I went with 64 Audio. It's really why I got the A12t after the ER4XR, Andromeda, and Vega. I realized that as much as I love each of those IEMs, I will always have an issue with comfort/fit with universal IEMs. My ear canal is stupid large and most large eartips will not fit. And if they do, I end up spending a lot of time adjusting them. Actually, I shouldn't say that about the ER4XR. The deep insert lets me use large tips where I never had to adjust, but would definitely get radial pressure and pain more quickly than the Andromeda or Vega.

I also work with audio all day and universal IEMs give me radial pressure/pain, along with the usual fatigue, after only an hour or two.

I swear, I've fallen asleep with the A12t on with music playing the entire time and I woke up with absolutely no pain. I've listened to music/audio 8-9 hours straight comfortably with no pain and barely any fatigue, with only a few short several-minute breaks in between.

And yeah it's not 100% isolated due to the apex but it's more than enough for me. You're also to adjust the isolation/tone with the two different modules, which I do all the time, though I can any enjoy any genre/99% of productions on each. Though I will always switch to the M20s when listening to audiobooks or podcasts. Isolation on the A12t is actually better than the ER4XR (though that could be just for me because, ya know, different ears and all).

That is different than being a sham. There is no reason to bring in Clinton other than the fact that you know you are wrong and have no defensible position. 

Second, I did not even mention Clinton, nor am I defending him. I simply wanted to know why you thought Daniels was a sham even after Cohen comfirmed the payment. This is about them, not Clinton. I am not discussing Clinton. If it makes you feel better I do think he is a piece of shit too,  but I was too young to even do anything about it at the time. That's besides the point though, because we are not talking about him, nor Hillary, nor Democrats, nor anyone besids Daniels, Trump, and Cohen. Try to stay on topic.

I am just someone who asked a question. So don't assume I'm a liberal or believe liberal things because I'm questioning Trump. That is simply a tool used to dismiss someone without addressing their points. If you want to know what I think, just ask, like I asked you.

Fourth, what is the need to call her a useless bitch? I am not attacking you so there is no need to fly off the handle. I just want to know why you still thought she was a sham. Obviously you don't, as you mentioned, it's just that you don't care. But lets be considerate and level-headed here.

Finally, and most importantly, do you not think that a man willing to cheat on his wife shortly after giving birth has *questionable loyalty and honesty, at best?* Isn't that a sign that Trump has no integrity or fidelty? Why should someone like that be trusted? How can we believe anything he says? Why should he be president, if he has no loyalty?

I am willing to discuss with you, but I won't respond to crap replies, attacks, or insults. So if you are indeed some russian, a troll, or have no interest in civil discourse, please don't respond. But if you do want to have a conversation however, please address *all* of my points. Please don't just focus on one line, but reply to all of them, if you do. 

(Also, its okay to criticize people you like or admire if they did somwthing wrong. In fact its more noble than just blindly worshipping someone.)",1525133144

Your post fell into a category that has been declared low-quality on this subreddit. This is due to the minimal effort required or common occurrence of this type of post when considering the amount of subscribers to the subreddit. Your post was either:

Card Generator - Card ideas are not banned! Very early on in the subreddit we decided that the majority of 'generator' content is in reality low-effort clutter. A card idea should have some supporting information about card behavior, a bit of reasoning as to why it has that much hp/damage/hitspeed/speed and what makes it special - it demonstrates that some thought has been put into the idea and immediately provides lots of discussion points. It's quite easy to go to a generator website, upload a photo and assign some arbitrary figures to it. We're looking for a bit more than that.

Continue to pursue legal action against Marissa. She needs to be held accountable for her actions. If you feel it's warranted, consider filing suit against her for compensation for your injuries. If you're missing work, and have had your quality of life affected, you may be entitled to something. At the very least, I would do so, if only to irritate Marissa.

You sound like you've realized you'll need to write off your relationship with Chloe. That she's willing to throw you under the bus, to salve the feelings of a violent drunk, is clear proof she's probably NEVER really had your back when you needed her.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","1. Most safelane carries have shit base stats, you totally need either a wand recipe + branches or at least 2 mangos to be ready for any situation that arises. I prefer the mangos because the passive HP regen makes a huge difference and the instant mana can save your life or get you kills.

2. I'm pretty sure even in games where I got stomped I didn't spend the entire laning phase under my tower. On that note if you really spend the entire laning phase lasthitting under tower you already fucked up in the draft, how will you get your boots or your stick or any other essential early game items?

3. You know you can leash the creep wave so it doesnt go to your tower right? You can also single pull so the wave pushes out even if the enemy offlane is heavily harassing you. If you're really bad you can just wait for the 2 minute rune to spawn, when you know the offlaner or his support will leave. Though realistically you aren't supposed to just stand under tower letting creeps eat tower shots, you're supposed to pull aggro and leash them to the incoming creep wave inbetween towers where you can safely lasthit(or die to the offlaner because you didn't buy enough regen).

Lastly I've noticed another big difference between high mmr carries and low mmr carries is ""picking for lategame"" because low mmr carries don't know how to control the pace of the game, so I can see how if someone is picking shit like Spectre or Anti-Mage they feel like they lost the moment they enter the lane, but that's yet another aspect of the game that 2k players need to work on if they ever hope to leave their bracket.

edit: you're correct that QB isn't always ""wrong"" but being against aggressive lanes isn't the time to buy it, if anything you should spend that gold on extra regen. QB is good vs timber, furion, treant, and other heroes that rely on trees early game so you can get to the lane early and chop down all the trees before the rune spawns.",1525133144

"BitcoinPrivate","t5_9m717","&gt;1) What are the expected uses of the google chrome extension?

&amp;nbsp;

For now, the google chrome extension is meant to be a way for us to inform you of scam sites that seek to scam you out of your cryptocurrency, BTCP in particular. Many sites popped up after the fork that are actively trying to steal your BTCP. We do our best to get them shut down but sometimes their hosts do not always answer our requests. This way, you’ll feel safer when browsing and researching about BTCP. On a similar note, we are working on potentially getting our wallet apps digitally signed so that there is added differentiation between our official wallets and imposter/scam wallets. Once BTCPPay goes live - this will also function as a metamask style integration with merchants.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;2) Is the merchant platform essentially a Point of Sale system built for BTCP? I'm picturing basically a wallet with a GUI for shop merchandise/price set-up and PoS features. Am I even close?

&amp;nbsp;

The merchant solution will be rolled out in several phases. The first phase will be a payment widget that merchants can use on their sites, blogs, etc. A POS is a possibility in the roadmap ahead and has been discussed. The payment widget will allow beginners an easy integration to accept BTCP on their websites while giving more advanced users the option to customize the process.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;3) Dandelion, Tor, and zk-s is pretty much the most private thing I can imagine. What other kinds of encryption could be added, beyond what is featured on the road map? Would they even matter, after all these layers of encryption?

&amp;nbsp;

zk-SNARKS hide information stored on the blockchain - values and pubkeys specifically. Tor and dandelion serve to obfuscate the ip addresses of people connecting to the network. Even with zk snarks - you might still be able to identify frequent users by ip address - you wouldn't know how much was being transacted or where it was going, but you might be able to figure out which ip addresses send a lot of transactions. Tor and dandelion make that substantially more difficult - tor by breaking the link between ip addresses and nodes and dandelion the link between transactions and originating nodes.

&amp;nbsp;

In terms of additions to the above - we think that provides pretty good hiding and obfuscation for those who want to run a full node. We're also focused on enhancing privacy for lite (SPV) clients - there's some amount of information that you give up when you connect to a server node (e.g. telling that node the set of addresses you are interested in watching). Its very much an open area of research but we’re looking at the feasibility of implementation of various private information retrieval protocols to improve anonymity for lite clients as well as the ability to generate shielded transactions in a secure way on a server. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;4) Seed Tor Nodes - wut dis. halp

&amp;nbsp;

This one is pretty simple - there isn’t a robust network of nodes running as tor hidden services right now - we’re going to start running a bunch to seed that network out. Ultimately - once we embed tor - our goal is to move entirely to that network for p2p communication. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;5) Would/could BTCP nodes act simultaneously as Tor nodes once implemented? This would strengthen Tor, and privacy over all, by increasing nodes, making BTCP an even greater asset to existing infrastructure.

&amp;nbsp;

As you've alluded in your question, there is a technical difference between acting as a Tor relay (or gateway) and hosting a tor hidden service. You can do one, the other, or both - and we encourage people to do both. But bandwidth has a very real and measurable cost, so coupling these two things would increase the cost of running a full node - which is definitely something we want to avoid - we’re not going to opt users in to acting as a tor relay if they don’t want to.

&amp;nbsp;

We’d love by the way (here’s an idea for an application layer product) to see someone build software that allows users to use BTCP pay for tor relay bandwidth - we think that would increase the robustness of the tor network even further. Once layer 2 networks (i.e. lightning) are live and more robust - this just might be possible.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;6) What alternate proofs of work would be evaluated, and do you have some examples of additions/alternates? This would be important information to consider for miners, even in its early stages.

&amp;nbsp;

It is more that we are evaluating different options. There are rumors that equihash ASICs will be coming soon, so we may choose to change algorithms. There are good arguments for and against ASIC mining, so we want to be sure we carefully weigh all options and be sure to consult heavily with the mining community as a whole. Some on the team are also interested in exploring some of the research into non work based systems such as proof of space or stake, but these are all ideas just being tossed around for the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;7) Does the e-commerce plug-in integration require the cooperation of the shop platforms, or is this an open source environment? If collaborative, are they already on board?

&amp;nbsp;

Many shop platforms are open source so we can just add these plugins directly to their system. We are also working on partnering with other platforms. Finally, we are working on a universal system that merchants can use regardless of their current platform.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;8) How does the team intend to bring volume to the BTCP-dex? Dexs are famously slow.

&amp;nbsp;

Like alternate proofs of work - this is just an idea that we’re tossing around right now. We’d love to see someone in the community come in to build this. We also think that the increased use and adoption of lightning networks along with the amazing work that’s being done to build better application layer tooling around lightning will make building a good DEX a lot more tractable.

Here is the code for the two functions:

This is the one that populates the name field, by querying a database for the username that was entered:

    my $name_lookup = sub {
    $manager_email = $cgi-&gt;param('manager_email');
    $stmt = ""select preferred_fname, preferred_lname from existing_active_wd_workers where username = '$manager_email'"";
    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($stmt) || die ""prepare: $stmt: $DBI::errstr"";
    $sth-&gt;execute() || die ""execute: $stmt: $DBI::errstr"";

    @rows = $sth-&gt;fetchrow();
    $manager_first_name = $rows[0];
    $manager_last_name = $rows[1];
    $manager_full_name = $manager_first_name."" "".$manager_last_name;
    $sth-&gt;finish();
    return $manager_full_name;

    };




This one takes the same entered username, and queries another table in the database to return the Supervisory Org (if any) associated with the username:

    my $sup_org_lookup = sub {
    $manager_email = $cgi-&gt;param('manager_email');

    $stmt = ""select supervisory_org_name, supervisory_org_id from supervisory_orgs where username = '$manager_email'"";
    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($stmt) || die ""prepare: $stmt: $DBI::errstr"";
    $sth-&gt;execute() || die ""execute: $stmt: $DBI::errstr"";

    my $sod;
    $i=0;
    while (@rows2 = $sth-&gt;fetchrow()) {
    $supervisory_org_name[$i] = $rows2[0];
    $supervisory_org_id[$i] = $rows2[1];
    $i++;
    }
    unless ($supervisory_org_name[0] eq """") {
    $sod = $sod.""&lt;select name='sup_org' id='sup_org'  onclick='set_sup_org_text(this.value);'&gt;"";

    for ($j=0;$j&lt;$i;$j++) {
    $sod = $sod.""&lt;option value='$supervisory_org_id[$j]'&gt;$supervisory_org_name[$j]&lt;/option&gt;"";
    }
    $sod = $sod.""&lt;/select&gt;"";
    }
    $sth-&gt;finish();
    return $sod;

    };


I don't see how the second one could be causing the value returned by the first one to disappear/be erased/whatever.  Again, this only happens in Chrome, for whatever reason.

If Gohan trained like Goku and Vegeta he would most likely be stronger than them.

Also as an adult people usually have their own stuff going on so you can maintain a friendship without being expected to hang out all the time (unless you really want to).

Enjoy your free time, try your best to put yourself out there. The best thing about highschool is that if you suddenly decide to be a different kind of person it's not that big of a deal because everyone else is doing it too. Every time you come back from a long break is an opportunity for a fresh start if you want it to be. That's the only highschool movie trope that's really accurate, at least from my experience.

 People would come back from summer and suddenly be cool, or join a new sport and now they are the ""soccer guy"" instead of the weird looking kid who you forgot sat near you in bio. I mean, it worked in less favorable ways too but my point is, you can change who you are overnight in highschool and they'll start talking about someone else's big change soon enough if you are uncomfortable with the attention. 

It's the best time to experiment with who you are because when you get older, no matter what weird stuff you did, you can laugh it all off as part of the past. ",1525133149

But instead of adding to happiness, it only adds +1 amenity to 4 cities that needs it the most (will prioritize cities with negative amenities). Trading luxury with another civ is definitely required if you lack amenities. There are other source of amenities such as policy cards, the entertainment district, and religion beliefs. But having a negative amenity on a city isn't much of a big deal tbh, as long as it's not -3 or worse you should be fine.

My golden rule in districts is to always build the commercial hub adjacent to the harbor (if I have one). Early campus is a pretty standard start. More science means you'll have early access to a lot of new stuffs, including other districts. Unless you're planning to get a religion, pick campus over holy site. 

During the ancient era I usually focus on building a decently sized army. Then I shift my focus on buildings until I need more units. Unless I'm playing a domination victory, I'm building districts and buildings like 75% of the time. 

I build builders if: 

* There's an available luxury resource

* I need to clear woods/rainforest for production boost

* There's an available spot for a unique improvement (like Kampungs for Indonesia or Polders for the Dutch). 

* Before I settle a new city.

* There's no building/district left to build and I don't need more units now. ",1525133154

I think it’s a little strange to not have to check your sugars, but it’s possible that might change in the next couple of appointments. If you’re US based, CVS sells glucose testing meters, testing strips, and lancets over the counter. The same testing meter that I have is $12 after a 30% off online purchase deal, 100 testing strips costs $18, and lancets are a couple of dollars. I test 4 times a day, it’s such a chore, but it keeps me honest and on track. 

I have zero family history with diabetes, have maintained a healthy weight most of my life, and was pretty active before and during pregnancy. GD was a total surprise, and a bummer, but we’ve all got to remember that it’s the hormones and not us!

Except that, instead of just listening and believing after receiving abuse that was ostensibly from us/gamers in general, she got suspicious and starting digging, only to stumble upon The Ralph Retort's posts on GamerGate and Zoe Quinn, an occurance which [/u/DwarfGate hilariously summed up thusly](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4f0ka8/drama_cat_fight_intensifies_social_autopsy_vs_zoe/d2567bx/):

&gt;Social Autopsy attacks Zoe Quinn....using TheRalphRetard as a source.
&gt;
&gt;Don't touch it. Don't do it. Just...just let this bomb go off and hope everyone's out of the way when it happens.

/u/Agkistro13 [later made this observation](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/4f35we/drama_ralph_interviews_social_autopsys_candace/d25slja/):

&gt;Because said normie has no idea how it would be weaponized. You have to remember, when somebody says 'harassment', we immediatley hear 'somebody disagreed with a feminist', and when somebody says 'control abusive speech' we hear 'ban conservatives and libertarians from the internet'.
&gt;
&gt;So we are already keyed in to exactly how this is going to be abused. Remember when this first dropped, we all immediately assumed they were a bunch of SJW feminazis asking kickstarter to fund their campaign against wrongthink.
&gt;
&gt;But it looks like maybe, just maybe, all their talk about harassment is actually NOT code for 'opinions I disagree with', and they thought they had a great idea that everybody would agree with. Now they're getting it from two sides- people who think harassment means 'harassment' and don't want to be fired for disagreeing with a feminist, and people who worry this service will define harassment in a legimate way, and make it harder to get people fired for disagreeing with a feminist.

Personally speaking, I can understand why people are suspicious of Owens, but she's never attacked GamerGate herself and I've had a few friendly exchanges with her, so I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt until she does something that proves otherwise. I do agree that the interview she and Blaire White were part of wasn't her finest moment, to put it diplomatically. And regardless of whether of whether or not you're for or against her, everyone agreed that Social Autopsy was a bad idea.",1525133154

I know that others have met kitty and he is fine but he started making sexual jokes on Bluelight and it made me uncomfortable because he is much older than her. I was fucked up and I didn't handle the situation correctly but by principle I don't think I was wrong.

She's smart but she is also naive. In hindsight she would never be talking to strangers she didn't know on the phone. She would never get picked up by a stranger on the internet. Just because I didn't turn out to be a creep doesn't mean a lot of people on Bluelight wouldn't be. Look at what happened. The guy took pictures of a fucked up girl on drugs and that is just wrong.

&gt; A monopoly exists when a company so dominates a market that it can reduce output and cause a rise in prices over a substantial period of time. Monopoly law typically kicks in when a company controls about 75 percent of a given market, Hovenkamp said. But no U.S. tribunal ― whether federal or state court, or the Federal Trade Commission ― has ever found Amazon to be a monopoly, Hovenkamp said.

So, after explaining the criteria for a monopoly being market share, they don't bother giving the market share of Amazon in e-retail and chicken out with a line about having been found guilty. Wonder why.

The rest is about taxes and how AKSHUALLY the munificent Amazon did pay 13% total taxes at all levels combined, but Bernie specified federal income tax, and they haven't bothered to give a breakdown, so...",1525133155
"TrueDoTA2","t5_2tk78","No problem! Always glad to help out a fellow dota player who wants to learn. 

In general the point of midas (on invoker specifically) is to boost your XPM because levels are so important. Melee vs ranged doesn't make a huge difference, it's basically 20 more XP versus 20 more gold. But in a satyr camp for example when you midas the big satyr instead of the little satyr, you get 50 less gold and 110 more XP, which is near the same ratio as buying a tome. So if you think it is worth it to buy tome (which most people would) then it makes sense that it's worth it to midas the big creep. Similar situation with catapults. There are a couple other small reasons, like killing a big creep takes a little longer so you speed up your farming a bit by killing instantly with midas, and you can cause a lane in equilibrium to push more quickly by killing the ranged creep if it's not safe to stick around and farm the wave.

Raindrops are an almost always item, unless the other team has 0 nukers who might try to gank you. Against zeus I would usually let them get to 1 charge and then keep them in backpack when you are in lane, shifting to inventory when you go into jungle for the regen. 

You usually only get treads if you know you are going to have to fight to defend base before you get aghs, or the enemy is taking enough map control that there is no point in BoTs. Creating map pressure is a big part of invoker, and BoT's are very helpful. 

Pressure in general is a big part of invoker, you should read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/729m6v/decision_making_the_though_process_of_a_6k_player/), that's something ive been working on personally lately.

To have time to kill a camp and get back to the wave, I like to cast alacrity a few seconds before the enemy creep wave gets to me. That way I can have alacrity to kill it quickly, and have it off CD to kill the camp quickly as well.",1525133155

Overall variance is a bit more tricky. It can be computed by [The Law of Total Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_variance).

This is how the expected value and the variance breaks down, you should be able to compute each mean and variance of each set and put them together with these ""laws"", or just compute the mean and variance of the whole set directly.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The economy runs on the circulation of money, not the growth in the bubbles of capital investments or personal savings.

I have earned between 65k and 80k  each year since I graduated from college in April, 2010.  A quarter of a million dollars is just sitting in stocks, bonds,  mutual funds, money market, and checking.  It isn't being used for goods, services, or infrastructure.  It isn't  circulating to a grocery store, to a farmer, to an agricultural wholesaler like cargill, to  cargill employee wages, to  their mortgage payments and  local sports teams and schools, to teachers... you get the picture.     It's just sitting there,  doing nothing,  or maybe its value is artificially and arbitrarily rising and falling  in a bubble of capital derivatives generating value  based purely on the fluctuations in the  purchase and sale price. 

But it's not actually contributing to the community.   That's a pretty sizable chunk of  my earnings, and I'm middle class.  There are ~100 million Americans living in households which take home more pay, and ~200 million Americans living in households which take home less pay.    Some save more,  most probably save less,  but among those that save more are hundreds of thousands and even  millions of Americans  with several times as much money as I can lay claim to.

I could lose  every penny of those savings I listed above,  and  it wouldn't change my lifestyle one bit.     It might impact my lifestyle 30-50 years down the line, but not now.

Together,  the millions of Americans like myself who are comfortably middle class, upper middle class, upper class, or capitalist class, hold  trillions in untapped resources that could be used to better our communities,  with minimal sacrifice on our parts.   Especially those in the capitalist class.       

This doesn't even begin to cover the profits of corporate america, which are of similar depths.

All of that money just sitting there *is already drained from the economy.*   Low taxes encourage hoarding like this.  High taxes  encourage  reinvestment of capital because to not reinvest means to forfeit a higher percentage of your gains.

[Click here](https://www.creators.com/read/brent-bozell/04/18/the-cant-do-republicans) for a less toxic, cluttered link directly to Creators Syndicate (which runs columns from both liberal and conservative writers).

Before you downvote it ""because it's *Investor's Business Daily*"" - the main idea of this opinion column is that Republicans are failing to deliver on their promises and deserve to lose the 2018 midterms. Excerpt:

&gt; The Republicans are now facing the same future in November. At this point, they will certainly lose the House and quite possibly the Senate. Worse, they've so botched their opportunity that only they can save themselves now. Their $1.3 trillion omnibus bill was not just the most reckless spending bill in history, it was an abject surrender on every single political and policy pledge made to those who put them in office, save helping the military.

Oddly, *IBD* did not edit this part out:

&gt; What they came up with last year rewarded big business nicely while excusing nearly 50% of Americans from the responsibility of paying taxes altogether. Everyone else was given a small amount of relief. Those were your voters, GOP.",1525133158

Depending on the strength of your case and the ability of the person who hit you to pay they would probably take the case on the condition they get X% of the payout if they win. Given that the person that hit you didn't have insurance it is questionable that they can pay even if/when they lose the lawsuit.

* 5-Time Championship runner up Mark Martin took 112 races to win        
* Ernie Irvan, who could've won a championship if not for injury took 78 races to win a race            
* Chase Elliott had 38 top 10's in his first 2 seasons, Jeff Gordon had 25         
* Chase Elliott had 22 top 5's in his first 2 seasons, Jimmie Johnson had 20         
* Chase Elliott finished 5th in his 2nd season in points, Gordon was 8th and Johnson was 2nd          
* Jeff Gordon only completed 63% of the races in his rookie season, Erik Jones completed 77%, Chase Elliott was 94% 
* In his Rookie season Erik Jones scored 14 top 10's, Gordon had 11           
* Also it took Kyle Larson 98 races to win a race, and now he's at 5 career wins

"Calgary","t5_2qn40","Yeah, the AS400 system really doesn’t *need* to be replaced though. It’s got everything you need for pretty much any retail environment aside from a fancy GUI. I would never have it be a customer-facing system, but for staff who just need to look up stock by SKU, UPC, or name and find quantities, price, cost, vendor, shipping lead time, etc, it’s absolutely perfect. And the fact that you can run everything but a modern POS system from it is amazing. Inventory, ordering, receiving, write-offs, sales data. You name it, it can probably be done in an AS400 system. They’re also endlessly customizable. And then finally there’s the fact that it can be run on the most basic available hardware.


And plenty of more modern looking systems are *basically* AS400 (or similar) behind a nice GUI. Which actually slows things down by adding an extra layer of software between the user and the system.

What you see is a sun that travels from Horizon to Horizon, coming up from below the east Horizon going down below the west horizon, maintaining its size in the sky. 

Here's another experiment for you to show that the Earth is round. Like I said don't take my word for it, this requires no faith whatsoever. Before sunset, go to a beach or a large expanse of water where the Horizon is water. Lay down on your stomach and watch the sun go below the horizon. Then stand up and watch the sunset again! :-) What happens is that your Vantage Point changes and you can actually see further over the curve the higher you go. If you wait there for the sun to go down at that height and then climb to the top of a sand dune you can watch the sunset for a third time. The only way that happens is if you're on a globe.

Actually, one of the things that pushed me to lift my car was that I clipped a rock while driving on an admittedly rough road for a car, and it bent my stock skid plate up and it almost hit the turbo inlet. I've always figured that it's more important to make sure my car can handle whatever I throw at it before I give it some go-fast parts.

I plan to build 2-way fronts, a sub, and MTM center to accompany these speakers.

The drivers are the Dayton Audio RS1004 4"" Reference FullRange Driver 4 Ohm. These are driven with a 5.1 receiver.

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","Several. The institution of marriage before the Fall and the Bible's general attitude towards it is a major one. People's strong physical and emotional desires towards it - which can only be described as good and natural - is another reason. 

The only real reason people question the continuance of marriage, in my opinion, is Christ's answer to the Sadducees. I don't consider this a strong argument for several reasons: first, the marriage described here and the view of marriage held by the Sadducees is based on duty, not love. The Sadducees had a low view of women and basically viewed them as property, just like most people of the time. This stands in stark contrast to the perfect coupling we see in creation, where the man and woman are truly made for one another. Love is the true foundation for such a relationship.

Second, the lack of evidence for this in the rest of the Bible. If the standard interpretation of these passages is true, then Christ was unveiling new, stunning revelation that is not found in the entire Old Testament, nor the New which came after He said this. Yet, no one was shocked or offended by His answer, minus the silly Sadducees, of course.

Third, going off of the above, His point here was ultimate to prove the resurrection, not to directly answer their question. Why assume total sincerity and detail in His words when He's answering mockers? He's not answering a sweet old married couple. So why view His answer as if He is?

Fourth, why wouldn't it continue? Yes, of course, people say that it's an image of Christ and the Church, so the image will no longer be needed in their view. But why assume that's all it is? Additionally, we will eternally be pursuing closeness with God, ever learning more of our Savior. Eternity and perfection would simply make it a perfect image. Everything physical - like food and drink - is a picture of our reliance on God, and very few people believe those things will cease. Everything good that comes from God's hand proves His goodness, it is not a distraction from Him, and they do not compete with Him. It is not good that man should be alone, and that will not suddenly cease to be just because man is united with God. Our genders continue, our bodies continue, everything that makes you desire closeness continues. There is thus no reason to think marriage would cease. Changed, yes; made perfect, like in the beginning. Removed, no. God is our Father, He cannot fulfill those things which a spouse can fulfill any more than He can provide human companionship for us. Yet, obviously, we need human companionship, as everyone agrees it will continue.

A big underpinning for all of this is our being made in the image of God. We should not view desires which are objectively good as being illegitimate or misguided. If they are objectively good, why should we assume they won't be fulfilled? Desiring marriage is one such thing. Desiring the adventures and depth of fiction is, too. Why is fiction so popular? Because people love stories, and people want to take part in them. If this universe was good to create, and God is glorified by it, why wouldn't He make more? Creating people to share His love with is obviously a good thing. Humans will keep creating in New Earth, so God, which is where our creativity comes from, will doubtless do the same. And I think we will all get to share in those new creations.

I understand this is wild to most people, so I don't expect you to agree. I hope you found it enjoyable to think about, if nothing else.",1525133161

Tony is a genius but not a wizard, and he hasn't really been shown to do anything similar (aside form building the Mk1 out of weapon parts, which makes more sense), and how he infiltrates the mansion. Seems a lot more like an idealistic view of what could have happened, through the eyes of an arrogant playboy millionaire etc etc.

"TeraOnline","t5_2s527","i led a raid group in ff thru turns 1-12. maybe things changed with heavensward, but i cant think of a single dungeon over the year and a half or so i played that would even come close to the difficulty of something like lilith's keep or any of the other 410 dungeons, which is notable in that, at least to me, they are pretty clearly intended to serve as your introduction to the endgame. 


again, my perspective is dated, but the closest equivalent i can think of in FF would be the crystal tower, which i can distinctly remember being kind of a joke, whereas liliths includes several mechanics that are recognizably ""raid-like"" in their complexity. 

to be fair, i should mention that it's not like crystal tower didn't have any mechanics whatsoever, and that part of the reason it felt so easy might have been   that people tended to prepare better in that game before going into things. 

likewise, i'm not about to claim that the dungeons i'm referring are as actually as hard as your average mmo raid. but having raided now in ff (launch thru t12) wow (launch, wod, legion) and wildstar (launch), you could take any one of the mechanics ive seen so far in tera and comfortably drop them into any one of those raids -- the main difference being simply that there arent as many to deal with per encounter. lastly, FWIW, out the games i listed, wildstar was easily the hardest, and tera is the closest thing i've found to that experience.

This has been an issue with the mobile miner for a long time (way too long, and shame on ETN devs for this). As you stated earlier, Reddit is a place for conversation. People want to conversate in the ETN forum, but with people asking the same question over and over again, when the answer is openly available (even on the official ETN Telegram and Facebook) it get's frustrating. I'm not the only one frustrated with this same question over and over again in this community, trust me.

Card Generator - Card ideas are not banned! Very early on in the subreddit we decided that the majority of 'generator' content is in reality low-effort clutter. A card idea should have some supporting information about card behavior, a bit of reasoning as to why it has that much hp/damage/hitspeed/speed and what makes it special - it demonstrates that some thought has been put into the idea and immediately provides lots of discussion points. It's quite easy to go to a generator website, upload a photo and assign some arbitrary figures to it. We're looking for a bit more than that.

What timing method does the community agreed upon? Timing methods have been changed through the years of speedrunning, with SDA starting(? not sure) the method of starting when you gain control of the character and ending on last input. The reason for IGT to be used on some games comes down to differing load times based on the platform played on (i.e. some PC's run faster than others lowering the load times) and it's used as a way to have an equal playing field for all runners.

If you wanted to use old canon lenses, you'd need an FD adapter and the Metabones will be an extra $200.

Yes!
People say do this, dress this way, act like this, say things like this...sure, all those advices could make you succeed but by the end process is the end product still you?

But maybe there is this other side to view on this. I hated people who made a big deal with how they dress, putting so much time, money and effort into fashion. It felt like such fake, vain and superficial thing to me.

But recently I started buying more fashionable clothes because of work, I hated spending so much money on clothes. And I felt like an imposter wearing nice fitting fashionable clothing. But now I seek nice clothes, it kinda became part of my personality, I feel more comfortable and confident in them.

Maybe that saying is true, ""fake it till you make it"". You ""fake"" all these acts and advises until they become your nature.

I'm on this path of self improvement, slow but steady. And when I get there I wonder how would I react to some female attention I now deserve as this ""new and improved"" self. Part of me would finally enjoy the attention and attraction from a female person I lacked my entire life. But the other part of me, that part that is bitter and resentful towards women, would lash out.
I'm the same person inside. But now when I get wealth, nice clothes, haircut, maintained body and built confidence now I'm deemed worthy? Why couldn't women see my values and virtues without these superficial things?
You need to ornate yourself with so many ""decorations"" for females to deem you worthy and desirable.

1: Heart disease. That's code for Obesity. You fat, your heart don't work. If you're big, your heart literally has to work harder not only to push against the fat, but to to push blood out to all the little blood vessels that are now way further away than they should be, cuz u fat. It has to do that 60+times a minute, every minute of every day. Push a boulder uphill every day then complain you can't make it to the gym. That's what your heart's doin'.

2: Cancer. Hard to pin down, lots of causes, lots of random right now for the level of science we're at. Personally, I blame it on certain EM interactions, but there's a large population of boomers who had a lot of exposure to carcinogens right now.  

3: Stroke. (Can be caused by obesity).

I believe that the 0xbtc contract can be upgraded through the use of other contracts but I am unsure how that would work out for mining.  Perhaps there would have to be a new contract that copies the current ownership of 'pre-fork' holders and distributes those coins then provides the function for the new algo etc and we move on.

It doesn't make sense as far as evolution goes, either. Every time a woman with a functioning reproductive system has sex (even on most forms of birth control), she risks pregnancy - you don't really want to take that risk on a guy who's just going to up and leave, do you?

"cocktails","t5_2qpco","Ahhhh Malört. If you’ve had this mainstay of Chicago booze culture you either love it, or never, ever, EVER want to taste it again.

I grew up an hour or so from Chicago, and have loved the stuff since my first taste. Living near Atlanta now, it’s a tough find locally, but with regular trips to the Midwest I always pick up a couple bottles to share with unsuspecting friends.

On its own, it is startlingly bitter, I mean take-your-breath-away bitter. It is technically a beskbrännvin, or Swedish wormwood schnapps, and more often than not is ordered as a shot. Most folks have never played around with trying to mix it, but Brad Bolt of Bar DeVille in Chicago has created a wonderful mixture that highlights not only the herbal bitterness, but also the amazing citrus notes. Certainly not for the faint hearted, but if you are a bitter citrus fan, this one is for you.

**The Hard Sell**

- 3/4 oz Jeppson’s Malört
- 3/4 oz London Dry Gin
- 3/4 oz St Germaine
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice

Shake with ice, strain into cocktail glass, and twist a generous piece of grapefruit peel over the top. No garnish.

Cheers!

For example, the Chelsea boot thread had ""Under $150? Under $400? Under $700? Over $700?"" as the price ranges. While there really (arguably) aren't many great options under $150 besides New Republic, there are a huge variety of brands between 150 and 400. I can't personally speak from experience, but the general consensus seems to agree that there's a huge difference in quality between Huckberry and Meermin, while both have very similar looking products, are less than $100 apart, and are both between 150 and 400.

I'm not saying the general ""Under $X"" setup is *bad*, I just think adding a sort-of wildcard category where people post their favorite in-between-price brands.

Maybe including this in the next (denim jackets) post as a test wouldn't be a bad idea? Entirely up to you, man. Keep up the great work!",1525133176

I'm a victim of MSbP and seeing a doctor is horrifying for me.

On top of it all I have been begging for help from every corner of the world and internet for help and it seems like everyone just immediately misjudges me, has selective hearing, or are afraid or ignorant.


I need serious help.  This is a landmark case as my abusers are both practicing psychiatrists, and when I tried to confront them for acknowledgement of what happened and for reassurances / honest explanations I was attacked, stalked, and harassed ruthlessly.

I am scared as fuck for our future if authority figures like my parents can get away with the things they've done.

List:
Had my siblings feed me clorox bleach as a toddler.

Consistently encouraged and enabled my older brother whose character is exactly that of Mcauley Culkin's character in the good son.

He (my brother) has abused me the worst out of anyone, and he has a long history of drug abuse and crime and hurting people for fun.

They neglected me severely while under rheir care, I ate condensed milk out of a can and water with cereal many days while my mom was partying doing cocaine and xanax with random guys she met at the bar, one of them beat me on a regular basis and even hung me upside down from a victorian 2 story stairwell and laughed along with my siblings and mother about killing me if I didn't ""shape up"".

My brother and sister tried to drown me by throwing me into the deep end as a toddler.


I've been tricked into taking ritalin, and force fed it when I wasn't even being properly fed, and my trauma was ongoing and not being taken care of and was being bullied at school, which no one did anything about.


When I began acting out in school or had failing grades my parents lied by diagnosing me on the spot at parent-teacher conferences to make excuses that simple minded teachers would lap up, and to have my grades adjusted.


I was force fed accutane and severely emotionally abused, manipulated and coerced into taking it rather than just achieving a healthy life style.


My family, especially my brother have subverted my personal goals and relationships my entire life because my brother is jealous of me for loving myself (unlike him?).  I know for a fact he hurts me to feel secure about himself.  It is something I will never fully understand.

I was fed xanax by my mother and was sexually assualted while on it.  The only reason I know is because my brother likes to rub it in and break my self esteem down and hurt me.


My brother dosed our family with drugs many, many times, unisom was his favorite drug of choice so he could sneak out and commit crime.


I could keep going! This is only the tip of the iceberg and it is CRITICAL to understand and fix if humanity is to have any hope of a bright future.  I know many ""decent people"" who are psychiatrists who wrote me prescriptions for ADD when I never talked to them.

My parents, and my brother, are actively stalking and harassing me.  I live every day in extreme fear.  My agoraphobia and extreme fear of authority figures prevents me from filing protection orders.

I NEED FUCking help baaaaad man. AND I'm DESPERATE PLEASE SOMEONE WITH POWER TO HELP ME, PLEASE HELP ME.

"aspergirls","t5_31zba","It's funny because when I was in high school &amp; college I preferred very hippy dippy, loose-fitting clothes, and now that I've been working in an office for ~3 years I prefer clothes that are more tailored &amp; tight fitting. It's like the slight pressure sensation of a suit or structured dress helps me stay ""in character"" because my job is very people-centered. In the summer I tend to wear a lot of shirt dresses and wrap dresses with blazers, especially when I just don't have the mental energy to match an outfit. And there are plenty of dressy flats out there so you don't have to wear heels! If you find some basic work shoes that you really like, definitely buy backups for later :)

For wardrobe help, try checking out thrift stores so you can experiment with a wider spectrum of styles. The quality of the clothing is usually pretty reflective of the neighborhood around it, so keep that in mind. But the clothes you find there will probably be a lot more durable than whatever is on the rack at H&amp;M, Zara, TJ Maxx, etc. I've gotten all of my interview suits at this one charity thrift shop for $10 each. I'd also recommend buying a wide variety of accessories so you can experiment with trendier looks and get away with the outfit being somewhat more casual.

For me the most important thing has been to pay attention to the materials &amp; wash instructions. Taking care of your clothes is just as important as choosing the right clothes in the first place. Most of my work clothes are gentle cycle or permanent press &amp; hang/lay flat to dry; I usually get easy care fabric so I don't have to worry about ironing but I do have a small garment steamer for things that are more prone to wrinkles. And I don't get dry clean only unless it's a nice suit, or something that I really love just for special occasions :)",1525133177

Religions can be interpreted in a way that leads to war or terrorism. They can be interpreted in many ways though. I don't think that the religious texts sufficiently explain the problems in the Middle East though. There is this narrative that the Sunnis and Shiites have been battling each other for 1400 years over a difference in textual interpretations but that simply isn't true. They lived peacefully together for hundreds of years under the Ottomans. The Sunni/Shia conflict as we know it now didn't start until the Iranian revolution in 1979 which lead to the Iran-Iraq War and to Western funding of oil rich Wahhabists in Saudi. I don't think you can point at the Middle East and say that Islam is the main problem because it's very ahistoric and it ignores 100 years of Western Imperialism. ",1525133179

Isn’t the sentiment of that quote to look forward to who offers the best policies for people of color?

"EDH","t5_2scee","**Aura-based I Win combos**

* [[Splinter Twin]] is probably the most famous combo-aura in the game, but did you know you could combo it with [[Breath of Fury]] for a full Aura combo? This is important, as [[Plea for Guidance]] or [[Three Dreams]] can tutor for both parts in one go.
* For many of Splinter Twin's combos (including the Breath of Fury one), you can also substitute [[Elemental Mastery]].
* [[Burning Anger]] + [[Felidar Umbra]] ^( or [[Spirit Loop]] or [[Lifelink]]) + [[Famished Paladin]] is infinite damage without requiring the combat step. 
* [[Guilty Conscience]] + [[Stuffy Doll]] takes out target player. 
* If you're running Stuffy Doll, you may as well run the otherwise Host-Killing [[Pariah]] as well.
* [[Curse of Exhaustion]] is a classic Stax aura. [[Possibility Storm]] allows us to swap auras in our hand for random ones for the deck. Put 'em together, and enchanted player is locked out of their hand.
* [[Sun Titan]] + [[Gift of Immortality]] + a sac outlet allows you to get infinite activations of said sac outlet. 

And there are so many more options here - I was able to find a resource for 2-card combos that is up to date, and a resource that was kept until 2014 and subsequently abandoned, but there are more if we simply explore.

**Card Selection and Advantage**

* **Enchantresses** - like [[Sram, Senior Edificer]], [[Kor Spiritdancer]], and [[Mesa Enchantress]] will do far more than their fair share of work, and are worth protecting with any resource that would be redundant on Tiana.
* **Cantrips** - like [[Capashen Standard]], [[Angelic Gift]], [[Chosen by Heliod]], [[Hobble]], [[Pentarch Ward]], [[Ritual of Steel]], and [[Unquestioned Authority]] are actually card positive, as we can use Tiana to cast these spells multiple times. The king of these is [[Sage's Reverie]], which is likely to refill your entire bloody hand.
* **Rummagers** - like [[Curse of Chaos]], [[Epiphany Storm]], [[Prophetic Ravings]], and [[Tin Street Market]] are not technically Advantage - these are Card Selection, which is still very valuable, particularly in repeatable form. Besides, the deck wouldn't be complete without the ability to get cards back from the graveyard without Tiana.
* **Tutors** - From [[Enlightened Tutor]] to [[Three Dreams]], we are spoiled for choice here. Note that a [[Boonweaver Giant]] won't go infinite in our clutches, it might be worth the bluff.

Perryman can't stay healthy, otherwise he'd be an A.  He's a big hitter, and a natural run-murderer.  B

Kyle Emmanuel is about what you can typically hope for with a 5th round pick.  He's been competent but unspectacular. He shouldn't have still been starting for the Chargers last season, but the fact that he is, isn't his fault.  C+

Darius Philon was probably the best pick of that draft, just based on value. For a 6th rounder, he's been stellar.  500 snaps and 4.5 sacks for an interior lineman isn't bad.  He's not great, but he's a really good 6th rounder.  A",1525133182

"DrugNerds","t5_2sk32","I love EMCRIT and I completely agree with this blog post, but I wish they would specify what the prehospital vs. ER/ICU protocol should be in their podcast. There is no way I'm giving (or even measuring out) 40 micrograms of naloxone in a prehospital setting. This dose regimen might make some sense in (relatively) a controlled ER setting with all the airway tools and personnel you could need. But if I have a suspected opioid overdose who isn't breathing in the field, I'm not giving any less than 1mg unless I have 2 well-trained providers with me. Unless I am fairly certain it is an opioid overdose and I have 2 people with me to properly bag a patient, I'm not waiting around to give 40 mikes of naloxone to see if it is enough to restore spontaneous breathing. No one likes a combative, withdrawing addict on their hands but nobody likes an anoxic brain injury either.

In the field, hit an apneic patient with 4mg IN or 1-2 mg IM and work them like you would any other ACLS patient. Don't sit around waiting to get an IV while you try to bag them alone just to give them 0.04mg IV if they aren't breathing. Get them an airway, ventilate them, and hit them with a big enough dose to get them breathing again. 

That said, I completely agree that there is no such thing as a ""narcan-resistant"" opioid unless you are talking about a huge overdose of methadone that will outlast any amount of naloxone you can practically give.

Until I was about six, I thought that every TV show and advert was being recorded and streamed to the TV live. I felt so sorry for the actors in adverts that repeated a lot, because to me, it meant that they were stuck doing the same thing over and over again, all day every day. 

Around the same age, I read about puberty and thought it started and ended on your thirteenth birthday. I fully expected that, when I was about to turn thirteen, I'd go to sleep aged twelve and wake up aged thirteen with body hair, acne, a full set of breasts, and my period, while boys would wake up with acne, a deeper voice, body hair, facial hair, and the ability to get an erection.

I also thought that since Christmas fell in summertime for Australians, their months were reversed. I spent a while thinking, ""okay, so if it's May in the UK, what is it in Australia?"" and very nearly neomailed somebody on Neopets to ask ""what month is it over there?""",1525133182

So is your problem with the local people or the EPA? It would be nice if you provided a link so we could read about it ourselves. Why can’t the Chinese retrofit their plants to use natural gas rather than coal? You say that there’s no pollution but why should the people in Washington take their word for it and assume the risk? It’s not like corporations have never lied about the pollution levels in their waste.

&gt; We are told a lie that we shouldn't harvest the trees because it ruins the ecosystem, when all the foresters I have ever met have told me that the exact opposite is true. Old growth forests are a danger to the environment, not just from fires but for disease as well. 

I think you should really cite your sources here. I think you’re not giving us the whole story. I think you’re manufacturing a strawman. Sorry. 

&gt; If we want to preserve the environment, we have to do with knowledge and temperance and understanding. The modern environmentalist movement is doing far more harm than good!

It’s nice to just hear a conservative admit that we need to do something to preserve the environment. That’s at least a small step forward. Dixy Lee Ray’s book might be useful, but the problem hasn’t been that the environmentalists used scare tactics. They weren’t right about some things, but the things that they got right were just ignored.

"CivIV","t5_2w7xx","What exactly is the problem you're having? Having the low/est score doesn't really mean much, unless it's by a huge margin and it's the end

[Post regarding score. Take note though, OP's concern is for 1600-1700](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivIV/comments/397v3m/why_am_i_being_surpassed_in_the_161700s/cs5yijw/)

&gt; If I were you, I wouldnt worry too much about the score. You can easily climb over the other civs once you conquer more land. So it's more important to have a high military score(demographics screen), than the overall game score.

&gt; Majority of the games that I won, I have had a significant military advantage over the other civs, been a clear tech leader for the entirety of the game, while the other scores were low. I've had the smallest land area(before starting my conquests) and only had 1-2 wonders(before starting my conquests)

Having a low score by itself isn't a problem. A real problem would be if you overexpanded; if you underexpanded; have no reliable allies; keep getting attacked and losing territory.

Identify the real problem first, then start from there.

People know about Berkeley, especially in Silicon Valley. If you plan on working there, Berkeley will have significant employment advantages.

"smallbooblove","t5_3f944","&gt;  And I’m sure everyone will disagree with me, but that’s the only comparison I can make.

The comparison might be fair or not, but I think the bigger point is that women here aren't making a comparison at all. We simply like what we have are there isn't any need to compare. So any statement that puts ""small boobs"" in comparison to a trait that isn't socially pleasing* is going to be met with confused expressions here. 

But I do see that you were trying to find a closer comparison. If I had to make a comparison, I would say small boobs are like being flexible instead of stiff. Being flexible a nice perk and it lets you move through this world with relative ease.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","It's probably due in no small part to everyone hating it there and wanting to leave as soon as possible because:

1) Admin treats them like shit

2) We are insanely overworked and have to do everything, even by normal teaching standards

3) We can't even get fucking printing paper, we have to buy it ourselves (okay, actually, we get two reams of paper a month - about enough for anywhere between a day to four days of teaching depending on how much you need)

4) Some teachers are literally switched a week before school starts (a math teacher that was supposed to teach 8th grade got suddenly switched to 7th grade . . . a week before school)

5) There are some classes where you aren't even given a curriculum . . . and are taught by new, first-time teachers . . . with just a set of standards and a week of prep to work with (hello there everyone, dis be PaulA)

6) We constantly have to cover other people's classes during our prep because admin doesn't hire enough fucking substitutes

7) The kids are the most ungrateful, entitled, miserable, terrible little fucks that I've ever met

8) Administration and the high-boss-lady constantly parade around and have ridiculously sycophantic events . . . that they force everyone to attend

9) They make us do tons of ancillary shit beyond just teaching and then base our pay on that

10) They actively change grades in your grade book to make the school look better, so there are literally cases where students who have 30s because they do fuck-all get boosted to being in the high 70s. Sometimes entire classes of students.

11) Related to (10), there are no real consequences to students failing and acting like shit, so they don't even bother trying because they know they'll get passed along anyways (at one point I literally had a student encouraging her class not to do any work and refuse to cooperate because if they all fail they'd just pass them all along to the highschool anyway and just fire me)

12)  The crazy lady who runs the place treats everyone like replaceable cogs (according to older teachers there, she has literally started new-teacher orientation by telling them all that they are all replaceable . . . on multiple occasions)

13) I can literally make this a 100+ point list, I'm not even getting started here

They're bleeding talent and they are even more desparate to prevent that than normal schools . . . so they treat people even more like shit instead of fixing why literally everyone hates working there instead.",1525133186

No, I do mean the host bodies are made of actual organic matter, from living cells, exactly like human (and animal) flesh is. At least that's the intent of the show. Proof:

Season 01 Episode 05
----

&gt; Man in Black: You used to be beautiful. When this place started, I opened one of you up once. A million little perfect pieces. And then they changed you. Made you this sad, **real mess**. **Flesh and bone, just like us.** They said it would improve the park experience. But you know why they really did it? It was cheaper. Your **humanity** is cost-effective. So is your suffering.

Season 01 Episode 06
----

&gt; Felix Lutz: I was born. You were made. We feel the same. **We are the same these days, for the most part.** One big difference, though the processing power in here is way beyond what we have.

Now I understand this doesn't work very well with those stylish pools of uniform white liquid, and the 3D printers, but you know... Jonathan Nolan was never known for building narratives that make sense scientifically. He goes for style and for emotion, and that's the result. Just imagine the white liquid is a mixture of cells and nutrients.

You'll probably point to the ""you were made"" quote, but again the point here is not winning on a technicality or on semantics. We're discussing if Dolores has a skin like actual human skin, same materials, same structure, same function. And... *according to the show itself*... yes. She does. So if she does, then her skin has to look like real human skin, instead of this theory that they made her look artificial with make-up on purpose.",1525133188

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","My daddy had the same thing:  no matter how many times he beat Momma bloody, his blood pulled white, and Momma served a few days for the black eye Daddy always made me give him.  Momma died by jumping off a train.  Her blood was plain old red, the same color every average jerk pulled in an average lifetime, though maybe a little pinker than some.

It looked to me like a half-ripe tomato from the grocery store I worked at.

""Emma Jo!"" my manager, Mike, called from the other side of produce not long after my boyfriend and his hussy disappeared.  ""Come to my office.""

I nodded, as usual, and piled up the last few Momma's-blood tomatoes (as I've called them since I got my job).  This wasn't my first bullride.  Hell, if not for Daddy and his fucked up genes, they'd have caught me after my cousin turned up in the quarry outside town with her man-stealing face imprinted with my bumper.  But nope, I was clean as falling snow--never mind that we don't get snow this deep in Georgia.

Wiping my hands on the butt of my jeans, I went to have another sit-down with Mike.  Turned out he had buddies.

""Emma Jo Forsythe?""  A plain clothes cop--I can sniff 'em miles out--stood from one of Mike's cheap plastic chairs.  The cop held out his hand, and under the flickering fluorescent bulbs, it looked like something crawling from a grave.  It was chilly, too, and I kept our shake short.  ""Detective Tom Creek, this is Lieutenant Rachel Roth.  We'd like to talk to you.""

""Did you find out something about about Robbie?""  I sat down.  The chair creaked under my ass.  ""Is he okay?""

""I actually want to ask you about a feller named Jason Forsythe.  Sound familiar?  He made a plea deal with the Boulder County DA after he got charged regarding an arson spree.  Life in exchange for information concerning an awful lot of bodies down here.""

A little wobble of fear started in my guts, like I had a minute yet to get to the john to puke.  Still, I blinked, no sweat, no flush, nothing but a good, church-goin' lady with a streak of bad luck.

""That's my daddy.  He'd never do that.  He hates fire.  He get pulled?""

Lieutenant Roth pulled out an old-style video tape.  I swallowed.  Could have murdered a cold lemonade right then.  Mike turned it over in his hands a few times, a funny look on his face, like he'd chewed on stinging nettles and couldn't quite believe they weren't candy.  With a final squint, he shoved it in the VCR he kept for security tapes.  Detective Creek sat next to me and pulled his chair around to look me in the eye.

""Your daddy pulled white despite being caught on camera and havin' nearly a dozen witnesses.  Turns out, he's got a real rare mutation.  Keeps him pure as a spring morning.""

I nodded.  So they brought a video of Daddy getting caught.  Not my problem.  I just had to lie low a while.  Keep clean, mourn my Robbie, cheating bastard that he was.  Roth nodded to Mike, who pressed play.

Lunch rose in my craw as I saw myself, not Daddy.  It was a good video, despite me checking all around for cameras.  Those goddamn tiny digital security cameras!  I should have known.  I watched as I tossed bags in a dumpster--well-wrapped ones, like pieces of meat in the butcher's department.  Robbie and his slut.

Sweat prickled my forehead.  Lieutenant Roth took out a pair of cuffs and stood me up.  ""Emma Jo Forsythe, you are arrested on suspicion of the murders of Robbie White and Alandra Lewis.  Anything you say, and the color of your blood, may be held against you in a court of law....""",1525133189

I remember there was huge outrage in the community a little while back because there was some big sponsored test of ""chemicals in vape products compared to cigarettes"" and it concluded they were nearly as bad. They neglected to highloght what kind of vape was used for the study, and sure enough. It was vuse or one of those other gas station vapes. They're all bad. Go to your local vape shop, get your own mod, get juice from reputable companies that disclose their ingredients (should always be propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and flavor), and there's pretty much no issue. I've never heard of anyone having issue with a setup like that. Only problem I've ever seen as a result of vaping is that the clouds condense, and can leave film in areas that you vape in a lot, especially electronics and windows.

On the flip side, since spring is here I've been trying to read outside more so I recently went to a park that overlooks the foothills and found a nice rock to sit and read on for a while.  A pair of old woman came up and sat on a bench near me and started talking about me like I wasn't there.  At first it was harmless like ""looks like a nice place to read"" but then they started to say shit like ""I see her here all the time"" \(this is false as I had been there exactly one time before that and definitely didn't see them\) and ""I bet she thinks she *owns* that rock"" and other bizarre things.  I kinda think they might've just been senile and crotchety, but it was especially insane because I specifically chose that rock so I didn't hog the bench for an extended period of time.

The starter quality players outside the first round are Carr, Jimmy G (both 2nd round picks), Cousins, Wilson, Prescott, Brady, Tyrod, Foles and Keenum.  That's 9/32, two of which are second rounders, 1 is currently a backup (Foles), 1 just had a breakout year (Keenum, though I think he could actually succeed in Denver), and one who will lose the starter gig sooner rather than later (Tyrod to Baker).  Now, could Webb or Lauletta join those others?  For sure, and I'd obviously love that.  It's just hard to get another franchise QB and 2nd overall is a great place to get one.  

Edit: That being said, I do think if they weren't going QB, Barkley was the way to go and they made a lot of smart choices later on",1525133192

OWSLA \(Skrillex\), Foreign Family Collective \(Odesza\), Wedidit \(RL Grime\), there's a ton more.  There's more to it than just a label as well.  There are 3 essential pieces that make up an artist's ""team"".  A publisher \(the person/people making sure the artist gets their money and royalties\), an agent \(the person who manages booking events/planning tour schedules\), and a label \(combination of a distributor, PR, and AR folks\).  A manager coordinates all of them and acts as an artist's liaison so the artist can focus on their art.  It's important to work with people you trust and that were with you before there was any kind of fame or publicity \(at least for a manager\).  A manager should be an artist's right hand and make sure that the artist is comfortable with contracts/deadlines/tour schedules set by the rest of the team.  Being signed to a major label isn't a necessity anymore to be a successful artist, and they really just contribute to the same 5 songs being played every hour on major radio stations.

My brother (Arizona State University) my brother in law (just left the WHL due to age) and myself (WHL) all trainer with the same guy  at one point of another, Mark Ciaccio. He was with the Phoenix Coyotes when I trained with him, now he’s with the NY Rangers going skating coaching. 

Out of all of hundreds of hours I spent on the ice with him and the thousands of hours I spent with other coaches there are 3 things to keep in mind:

1. Knees bent always. The rule is, if you look down and you can see your skates, bend them further. This gives you power, control and balance. It also is imperative to maintain this stance because your stride efficiency depends on it. 

2. Each stride needs to go from directly under you to full extension of your leg. Knees bent helps big time with this because it allows you to get the maximum push with each leg. On the flip side every time you extend you MUST bring each leg back underneath you fully. Obviously should you extend fully and make sure you bring your skate underneath you fully each time you’ll have maximum efficiency and that’s what skating is all about. 

3. Palms UP. If your palms face down you’ll be more inclined to sway them side to side - disrupting your forward momentum. Every time you push get into the habit of having your palms up to ensure front to back motion. The idea behind this as well is when you’re skating full speed with the puck you should have the puck in front and off to the side where when you extend your stick hand forward with palms up you will be turning the backhand of your blade forward giving you the ability to push the puck while maintaining top speed. I hope that made sense

He would send someone to hell because that person is guilty of committing various bad deeds during his life.

He can do so even while He also has love for that person.  

If a judge had someone come before him who was guilty of crimes and was also someone he loved, if that judge were perfectly just, he would objectively sentence the person, regardless of his personal feelings.


&gt; I wouldn’t even wish a punishment like that upon my worst enemy, let alone someone I love.

Another thread not long ago mentioned this.  The user swapped jump button and said it was more enjoyable.  However saying it’s easiest if you learn to play with the button swapped from the beginning, than to relearn a new button layout after several hours/days in. 

Play botw slow and take it all in.  If your anything like me, it’s a world you’ll be returning to for many years to come.   It really is the most alive world sim I’ve ever felt.  The weather, the sky, clouds, overcast, rain, lightning, bright skies after a shower, then bright skies with really black clouds that make the sky that odd darkish color.  It really is unlike any other game I’ve ever played/seen.  

The more I play it, the more Iearn about the geography and landmarks.  The shops, stores, people and their routes.   Finding shortcuts to new places.  

And best of all, taking the day finding the highest dunes in the desert and going shield surfing for the day.  It’s a literal masterpiece.  I didn’t get it when I first bought it.  Then a month or so passed and I was curious what else Hyrule had to offer. Now it’s my most favourite game of all time.  And likely will be until a better version -if possible- is ever released.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I think it would depend on the campaign setting actually. In a high fantasy setting where everyone is used to magic every day any adventurer would know which (common) spells are which even if they are no caster themselves. But in a setting where magic is uncommon or even rare you'd hear some strange words and have no idea what is going on. What you describe for caster tricks would fit perfectly in a more politics heavy game where everyone tries to oneup eachother.

It also depends on how you want to play the game: as a high stakes tactical boardgame with the roleplay in between the fights, or just theatre of mind roleplay combat, or anywhere in between.

So based on these things you decide if you want to announce spells or not. But if you don't announce them there really isn't anything in the PHB-only that players can do to figure the spell out beforehand, so then the counterspell would actually always be fully blind.

(specifically arcana isn't used for figuring out spells being cast, if you just use what it says in the book)",1525133196

How about adding a few variables for us modders into SimGameConstants

I'm thinking (suggesting):

""LeopardDropFuelCostPerTon"": 0,

(we can then assign a cost for tonnage assigned to a mission and handwave this as Leopard fuel to carry those heavy mechs up and down - but more importantly give an incentive to players to take less weight on a mission and use those LIGHT AND MEDIUM MECHS MORE ;) )

and:


""FreeTonnagePerMissionHalfSkull"": 40,

(So costs for fuel only incur if tonnage exceeds this formula - i.e. the tougher the mission the more tonnage you can take without cost penalty)


-


That sort of lets us incentivize using lighter 'Mechs while still giving the player the ultimate choice in their lance loadout.",1525133198

Skip Harrison -- replace with a second ooze. The goal of Harrison is to help draw answers in tight spots against Cube Lock and sometimes Paladin where fatigue matters less. I'm still experimenting with only one weapon hate, but it's meta dependent.... Rank 5 to Legend especially is full of Cubes and Paladins so I would probably stick with two.

Elise has a real place in the deck so I think if you replace it your winrate against control will suffer, that's okay though if you're experimenting. Try two Direhorns.

I would say Darius is a must in the current version of the deck. There are other Odd Control Warriors out there without the rush package (maybe try one of those?), but you need Darius to justify 2 x Town Crier + 2 x Rabid Worgen.

And yes, Mosh is optional. I find him extremely effective in longer control matchups, but you can run without him and manage your clears better.",1525133201

"Coachella","t5_2qsp9","This year was probably the worst shuttle experience I've had in all the years I've attended. The additional ticket sales are definitely felt each night if you stay until the music ends and need to get on the shuttles.

**Weekend 1** 

Friday: We waited around 2, to 2.5 hours to get on a shuttle, and the bottleneck to get across the street to the shuttle area was awful. My gf had panic attacks every night and was in tears/hyperventilating every time we'd get up to that area. This was especially bad since we left after all the music had stopped Friday, but we waited for a good 30 minutes at the lockers before walking over and it was still a total shit show. This area was bad last year too but not as bad as this year. Hopefully they do something to fix it next year.

Saturday: Left Bey about midinght, still ended up waiting in the shuttle line for an hour, and still had the panic attack inducing bottleneck.

Sunday: Left about 11:45 from Em to avoid the rush again. Luckily the bottleneck moved a little faster so the panic attack wasn't as severe. Still waited around 45 minutes to get on a shuttle.

**Weekend 2** 

Was on the Palm Desert line, and unlike /u/TheBuzzerBeater, did not have a bus die on me (luckily) and the only major issue we had was the bottleneck. Since my gf and I had seen most of what we wanted to see weekend 1 we were able to avoid most of it since we were leaving pretty early each night, but it still backed up one of the nights. If we hadn't been leaving as early as we were it would have been just as bad, or worse than weekend 1 since we were on a line that was further than La Quinta.


It felt like they didn't have a good handle on how many people were taking the shuttles this year, and having shuttles in the right places. The biggest thing I think they need to fix though is the bottleneck to cross the street. That's asking for trouble and is really dangerous.",1525133202

And keep in mind, people will always support the voices that they feel represent their feelings. If someone agrees with a critics' take on the DCEU, they will ignore the take of someone like Jim Lee.

tl;dr Bill Finger could pop out of the grave and say he liked the DCEU; it's still not relevant to the people who hate it as much as some of these people do that someone venerable likes it.

First thing first, she wasn't flanking. she was defending point A and last time i checked you arent flanking everytime you arent on the point and seems like she knew the sombra was there so she was doing her job countering a known flanker setting up with a healthpack and invis. 

Oh stop it, she didn't instantly kill 3 people like you are vaguely implying and doing so you are dissolving legitimacy all the context of the clip which is misleading as fuck.

Brigs fought a sombra who fucked up her invis and trans locate twice on top of the notion brigs counters her, so how often do you call reaper op when they kill winston? 

then the tank with legit the worst dps (especially) against armor faces her in a small area , fucks up his leap leaving his pocket mercy exposed, and in response to not doing enough damage to counter her ult *ults himself* in order to do even less damage and try to man fight a losing battle. 

While the mercy never switches from heal to boost the monkey to burst her (how to kill her) and panics a bit and flys away from hacked health pack only to die from the brigs turning around.

I think briggs shield bash needs a tweak to have a longer cooldown but if you look at this clip and say ""OP"" i have to be honest with you and think you need to play the game more.

Everyone there made quite heavy misplays and that is why they died, i know it takes more thought to realize that then blindly call a hero OP but that is the reality of the situation.

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","&gt; Claim that macro data are dangerously politicized.

Actually this reminds me of a question I had. How much of the gains in measured income per capita over the post-WWII era been a fiction of the data-collection process?

There's this claim floating around that, ""back in the 1950s, a single earner could provide for their family. Now it takes two earners."" [This BE response](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/83ll72/raskhistorians_and_the_masculine_provider_fantasy/) raises the point that there was considerably more home production in 1950 relative to today. That is, you never really raised a family on one income; it has always taken two workers, but in 1950 we measured the production of only one of those workers, while in 2010 we are closer to measuring both of them, since more work is market-based rather than home-based. Hence some fraction of the rise in measured income per capita (measured income per household?)  over the postwar era has come a substitution from unmeasured, household work towards measured, market work, not from any increase in productivity or the like. 

So some of the rise in incomes is simply due to the fact that more people work in the formal sector, and accordingly less work is done in the informal sector; to some extent, we're not getting richer, we're just measuring more stuff. 

But how much does this matter, quantitatively? And how should it influence our understanding of post-WWII economic growth?

[This 2012 BEA brief](https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pdf) suggests that the inclusion of an estimate of household work would raise NGDP by 40% in 1965 and by about 25% in 2010.

What I want to do is draw a graph of RGDP and RGDP + household production over time and compare growth rates.",1525133207

Chabad would have been reading the entire portion of Acharei Mot + Kedoshim (double portion last week so Leviticus 16:1 - 20:27). Reform congregations that follow the Triennial cycle would read the first third of each parasha (leviticus 16:1-34, 19:1-18). 

I'm sure there are other reasons why the services could have been shorter, but lots of non-orthodox denominations have shorter readings.

Edit: The triennial cycle is actually an old custom of the Rabbinic Jews in Palestine who would read through the torah every three years, but read it straight through without skipping. Many conservative/reform/reconstruction congregations do a modern version of this where every week they follow the weekly portion that orthodox Jews read, but they read a different third of the parasha depending on the year in the cycle. This year is 'year A' so they read the first third.

Anyways, good luck on your journey! Both my parents are converts (actually they converted twice, once conservative, once orthodox) and it is definitely a hard but rewarding journey. Lots to learn.

BaM stores often do little to convert people into board gamers because they have cultivated a stigma which stops ""normal"" folk from going to them. They are often dim, unwelcoming troll hovels full of the type of social recluse that society shuns. Is that every BaM store?

Like it or not, target, Walmart and Amazon selling some designer board games has likely done more to start people playing games than all the BaM stores combined.

That he was the child of a military family but maybe hadn't been in the military himself. That he died after the last attack, either killed by a homeowner or in a car accident or the like, or from a terminal illness people thought he may have had due to the dog reaction.

Most of all, many of us thought he would have been in the case file, somewhere in those 15,000 pages. Michelle McNamara put the odds at 80%.

** *
&gt; There is no correlation between vaccines and autism

There is but it's not what people think. **A healthy child will not develop autism from vaccines**, but a sickly child with autism fits into the diagnostic category of common variable immune deficiency (CVID). This category is at a higher risk for vaccine injury, and autistic kids might be a particularly vulnerable subgroup due to certain genetic factors associated with the condition that puts them at a higher risk of vaccine injury (depressed immunity, autoimmunity, and inflammatory activation are common features of autism). 

Remember that autism is a spectrum: some are high functioning, and others are severely disabled by it. This is important to understand because it is possible that vaccine injury to kids that fit the CVID profile (autistic kids specifically) might be making them worse. Regressive ASD, a condition where a child begins to develop normally but rapidly declines and starts to lose speech and social skills in the 15-30 month range before being diagnosed with autism. This is something that very much still needs research, especially since there is no requirement for infants to be tested for symptoms of CVID before undergoing vaccinations (we lack proper diagnostic procedures). [Here is an article from February of this year about it](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781119042280.ch9)

Tl;dr: vaccines don't cause autism in healthy children, but they might make autism worse in children that already have it. There is a correlation between autism and vaccines, but not with healthy children",1525133210

A12t can't match A18 in terms of Soundstage, clarity and transparency but the A18 had to increase treble to unnatural levels to achieve those 3 things which is wrong imo.  
  
You can say Legend X is a better Vega but again, you will miss that airiness of the Treble with it.

2. Maybe maybe not. This is a real sport, not a rec league and you’re not a babysitter. I’m  all for being inclusive. But you can’t take individual medals away from an athlete...especially in big meets.

I suppose the simple solution is that you stack your best in the open sprints and have the others run the relays. I’m HUGE into the relays. But it’s not uncommon for me one run 2-4 “B squad” runners on the relays. They are coached up and given attention, etc. the hope is that a couple rise to the top so when I add my “A squad” guys to them, we have a good relay.

An exception...and this may not apply to middle school girls...but we attempt to lockdown the 4x1 and not mess with the order or use alternates unless necessary because it’s a race where fractions of a second and chemistry matters. But our 4x2 and 4x4 is completely fluid until May (I have some hard decisions to make the next two weeks).

But like I said, if you are going to any kind of Invitational with awards or qualifying meet, you should never take away a medal from a deserving athlete.

I don't want to use the word threat, but that's basically what it is.

The president of the United States publicly said that the countries who will not support the United 2026 bid should not be supported by the US, he even explicitly made it clear this wasn't about just sports but something much more serious by mentioning the United Nations. FIFA's rules do not allow this (and for a good reason). And if a head of state of some Middle Eastern country said the same thing, you would have much bigger outrage and maybe even automatic disqualification, but since this is the US they just got ""warned"".

Here's the tweet:  “The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to **lobby** against the U.S. bid. **Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the *United Nations*)**?”

* If the person is unresponsive **DO NOT TOUCH THEM, and stay by them to keep others from touching them as well.**
* If they are responsive, tell them to not move their head or neck until EMS arrives.

Trying to move a neck or head injury can cause or worsen paralysis and concussions. They *have* to be stabilized and mobilized using proper kit and technique

Republicans didn't even reliably carry the South until Bush, before then Republicans either won the entire country or lost the South (or split). Hell several Southern States are just now electing Republican governors and senators.

Lyndon Johnson was not by any means some progressive person on race, and Democrats opposed civil rights laws more than any Republicans. Republicans were the majority passing these laws in opposition, literally any voting record shows this.

I did tell him most of this because he was extremely upfront, this has developed over a matter of weeks but lately the attraction between us both was too strong to deny and because he is a very candid person, he laid it out on the table and we talked...

I'm glad we did, maybe you could too? It helped me understand him a bit better and it allowed me to tell him that his feelings were reciprocated, so if he ever does end it with his current, I am there in a heartbeat... or however long he needs.

2: I offer free, voluntary, high level classes (offered in high school and college if you didn't do the HS ones). Politically balanced council oversees material. Maybe the topics are Micro Econ, Macro Econ, Ethics in Government, How to Stay Informed, Government structure, History of Government. Courses intentionally require a decent attention span to pass (long form answers to tests, etc). People who pass the voluntary courses get 100 votes and are able to run for any office. (My theory is this would allow for more qualified candidates, not less) 

3: After #2 is initiated and the voting base is slightly shifted to a more level-headed base, we start a gradual shift to a more direct democracy. Power will be split more among the people to properly represent them and slow the spread of corruption. 

4: A tax system that institutes an exponentially higher tax (more than now) based on earnings and capital, but also institutes an exponentially higher tax break based on how many people you employ and the average pay of the non-managerial staff you employ.

When you say you played with legos as a child, it sounds to non-Americans like you're saying I drank a glass of waters or my sandpit has a lot of sands.*",1525133226

It wasnt a mugshot, it was a sketch based on the memory of an event that happened 7 years ago.

And there you have it, plausible deniability. If Cohen hired the goon and didnt tell Trump, the defamation case has no legs - as far as he was concerned this never happened and it was a con-job. 

&gt; And whether or not this is a frivolous lawsuit really depends on the evidence Avenatti and Daniels may be holding. If they have nothing then I totally agree with you, but I think it’s best left to a judge to decide.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","It’s impossible to have a system with no capital appreciation for a few reasons - the first is that an economy is the aggregate of its producers and consumers, producers cannot feasibly ensure they make no profit because it is impossible to predict what their demand function will be. If they produce cupcakes and try to end up with 0 profit so as to not ‘privately’ own them, they will likely fail. If they decide not to bother and close up shop, their residual capital will either sell for a profit or more likely depreciate and become useless. This is the second reason. Capital always depletes, and If this capital stock is reduced the value of the rest of the capital will go up, necessarily. So even in the absence of physical money, if a particular piece of capital (let’s say, a hammer) becomes scarce, it appreciates, and therefore whoever has the hammer is technically making a ‘profit’.

Like you mentioned, it is fairly difficult to find library-related work. The school librarian you spoke with was right, in that there is plenty of work for people with MLIS degrees, but it isn't in libraries. Because I wanted to work in libraries, and had no marketable library experience, I decided to earn my library tech diploma before pursuing my MLIS. I used this time to identify what type of library work I wanted to specialize in, and take advantage of co-op and networking opportunities to try and secure long-term employment as a librarian.

Do you have an idea of what sort of work you want to pursue with an MLIS? If so, that would probably be the best choice for you. If you plan on working in your university system after continuing your education, an MLIS is definitely the best choice.

"OrthodoxChristianity","t5_2qra3","That's really a huge can of worms, but I'll try to answer succinctly.  You don't need to like everybody.  But you do need to love everybody.  That's the key.  You don't have to invite your oppressor over for tea and let him preach his false religion to you, but you must show him the unconditional love that God shows for all of us, even those who hate him.

The Church Fathers don't read the Old Testament literally, *per se*.  The Psalms, and all the OT, is interpreted ""spiritually,"" that is, in the light of Christ.  David was a fallen, sinful man just like us all, and one of his failings may have been his failure to forgive some of his enemies--though if you read how he treated King Saul even when the King was persecuting him, you'll know that that's not true for all his enemies at least--but the Church Fathers read David's enemies not as our personal enemies, but as the demonic powers and the forces of evil and sin.

Someone leaking your nude photos may eventually be inconsequential, but it will only become more important to secure your personal data against bad actors. Today we tend to leave this in the hands of big tech companies because they can generally take better advantage of it than we can and we get free software in exchange. This isn't *necessarily* a bad thing. If the data silos of the world are kept safe, our biggest problem will be negotiating the value proposition between consumers and these tech companies. 

I won't speculate too much about what the future of data security might hold (I might as well just say blockchain over and over again).

Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date!

&gt;""Precise"", for a model, means, ""it matches reality"". So reality is ""precise"" by definition. (According to the way I was using the word ""precise"", anyway.)

But then our own reality is merely one arbitrary permutation of an infinite number of possibilities. If the universe turns out to be infinite, our localized reality itself becomes arbitrary. 

&gt;But they can't be figured out, which you would know if you were listening to what I'm saying about irreversibility.
&gt;
&gt;*It is mathematically impossible.*

We still have plenty of information to go on. The stars are still shining and light is still trickling in from all around. All those elements are still moving around. 

&gt;Well yes, but then we're just talking about a normal approximate simulation, not the godly, numinious thing you were describing that ""transcended death because it had already contemplated all possible realities"".

Depending on how precise and vast you go, that last bit is somewhat in it's grasp. Perhaps fundamental limits of our reality prohibits all possible realities but given enough of a sample size and it approaches 'closer enough'. 

&gt;Why would it see less or more than us? Remember, it's just a computer. It can't *see* the universe any more deeply than we can see with our scientific recording devices.

I think on the contrary we're limited in what we can see with recording devices. A QAI might not gather more information from a localized perspective but it would be able to see all the various probabilities that we can't even begin to contemplate. 

&gt;Sure, but the idea of something that had ""contemplated all realities"" is just marketing mumbo-jumbo, basically.
&gt;
&gt;The things are good at solving certain types of math problems.

Yes, it was the exact same thing said about the first computers until more novel use cases came about. 

&gt;&gt; They might not necessarily see it that way. 
&gt;
&gt;Sure; my whole point is that they might be programmed to see things in *any* way. Their quantum nature doesn't affect what they think about what's ""good"" or ""bad"" -- it only afffects how fast it can solve certain math problems.
&gt;
&gt;There are no math problems that you can solve to find out what you should consider to be ""good"" or ""bad"".

You can certainly try to optimize for various outcomes but even then you can't be sure if it's something you (as a human) wanted in the first place. But this is coming from a simple optimizing calculation computer perspective and not something potentially sentient. A 'sentient' AI mixed with enough quantum computing power seems like something that would transcend us in mindset. 

&gt;I'm still very sorry about being rude before, but at the risk of being rude again, I don't think you really have the gist of it. You need to spend less time trying to puzzle out the magical-sounding bullshit that assholes package with quantum mechanics, and spend more time with the weird math, until you get the feeling that the weird math is all there is.

Connfused, Phoneix takes the first two pitches for strikes. He settles in, ready for the next pitch. Schwizzle attacks him with a slider that dives off the table and into the dirt. A huge swing and miss from Phoenix. 

Zyz is able to block this one keeping it in front of him. Still confused, Phoenix doesn't even try to run to first base as Zyz fires it on to first to complete the strikeout.

Yes. Because that's what it is. You want to punish *all* white and passable-white people with restricting language for the sins of *some* of their ancestors. It's *such* a wrong thing to do that it was marked as a war crime by the Geneva Convention.

Or should we start holding *all* black children responsible for the crimes of *some* black ancestors? Because we kinda sorta do (see: implicit bias) and it's *very* wrong, but we recognize that and are trying to correct it. You trying to say that it's fine when it's one race over another? You're a racist.

&gt; You found an exception from a shitty rapper.

Dude, white people not using ""nigga"" is because of sensitive assholes that don't represent the black community at large. They're like any other fringe group of squeaky wheels: loud and attention-grabbing.

Culture is meant to be shared. It always has been and it always will be. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery after all. There is no higher praise for a culture than trying to make it part of your own. In a globalized world, avoiding cultural appropriation is pretty much impossible. This might sound like dirtbag horseshoe theory, but the only fundamental difference between people crying ""Cultural Appropriation"" and ethno-nationalists is motivation. The means and ends both involve trying to keep cultures isolated from each other and ""pure"".

Worst: Kanye at Outside Lands. I didn't stay to see the whole set, after he stopped the majority of his first few songs to ramble about various things, like how the audience wasn't forming large enough circles (?).  Glad I didn't pay to see him.

Second, very-distant worst: Idina Menzel, just because of my misguided expectations. I wanted to hear her belt showtune classics, which she did--and that part was amazing--but I thought her originals were very underwhelming, and she capped off the night by letting what felt like every damn kid in the audience sing their own verse of ""Let It Go,"" one by one.

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","It's probably worth drilling down on this confusion a bit more deeply, since its implications are broader than just string theory. As I've pointed out to you, what one considers the ""knobs"" of a theory are not so obvious when it comes to questions of scientific demarcation. One cannot consistently maintain that string theory has too many knobs to turn without admitting that so does CM or QFT. It would seem that a naive scientific demarcation criterion doesn't work -- one has to put in a bit of effort to discuss the details of the two theories to tease out in what way one might be pseudoscientific and the other not. Of course this presents a problem to the naive falsificationist, because it is exactly this kind of work that he objects to, since all kinds of epistemological criteria must be applied that are not falsifiable, such as logical coherency, parsimony, consistency with previous data, falsifiability in theory vs practice, whether the theory has been fraudulently tweaked to fit previous data or fraudulently made unfalsifiable in order to escape falsification, whether the ""knobs"" are at a fundamental level or are anthropic, whether the knobs are for model-building within a framework or are to fraudulently escape falsification, whether there are credible alternative theories, and so on and so forth. We can do the work of descending into this discussion, but it's important that you do understand that the ""tunability"" of CM and QFT and string theory are exactly the same. The framework of CM and QFT and string theory are not tunable, but in each case we don't know our initial conditions. The nice thing about string theory is that further than this, you don't have to build models within the framework to fit the data, as you must do in CM. In this sense the tunability of string theory is far less than CM or QFT. The downside is that it is in practice much more difficult to find an effective string theory vacuum as we have been able to find an EFT of wherever we are in the landscape of possible QFTs, and as we have been able to find ourselves in the landscape of  coarsely-grained CM initial conditions and CM effective low energy Lagrangians. It sucks that it's more difficult, and it may sound superficially like pseudoscience, but that's why we have to do the difficult work of actually understanding it and teasing apart our epistemology, just as we should do in other places where the wider masses tend to get riled up against consensus views, such as climate science or dark matter or vaccination.",1525133244

im not from america but if you're just getting into paddling i recommended seeking out a river safety course/swift water rescue.  
Not only will it make you safer on the river but it will put you in touch with other beginner boaters and your teachers will have a lot of knowledge about the local boating community.

Other wise look for other forums, even out of state as im sure they can hook you up with buddies or other niche sites and face book groups.

Stay safe, remember you're always between swims so get ready to chug those booties!

Your post would be perfect back in the days of Warhammer 1 but now, the Dwarfs do not deserve a nerf. You’re telling me there’s an easier of dealing with the GS factions from every single side? I know it’s definitely possible to beat the Greenskins. I’ve finished WH2 Dwarf campaigns before but it is nowhere near as easy as it was in Warhammer 1. If you truly find WH2 Dwarf campaigns, you’re going to laugh at WH1 then.

"bisexual","t5_2qwnx","So, I don't know how old you are, but if you're under 18 (or the age of consent in your country), please don't seek out people more than a few years older than you. I know it feels like it's okay because they have more experience, but there are a lot of predatory people of EVERY sexuality and you'll be a prime target as a minor in a marginalized community. I don't say this to play into stereotypes, but it's a real thing that happens often, and every person that I know who has experimented with much older people has regretted it.

That being said, the larger and more progressive a city is, the easier it is to find people around your age who are LGBTQ. Apps are an option, but as someone mentioned, always meet in public first if that's your go-to. LGBTQ community centers are also an excellent way to meet others; many have age-specific groups and hangouts, and almost every major city will have at least one. If you're in college, or near a college town, a lot of universities have LGBTQ groups (sometimes, you can join in certain events even as a non-student). LGBTQ bookstores (if you're in a very liberal area) are also great resources for finding new people.

If you're from a small town or significantly younger, you'll honestly have a lot harder time. Your options will be limited and harder to find.

Hey! ...That’s great my friend (Ice creams on you then) 

Oh I’m sorry to hear that my friend. You are putting yourself out there in the world trying to get a job... you also had a good interview... please try to focus on these positive things as you are doing great. 

I understand that you want to cut either way. I think it’s best if you don’t cut though :) 

I hope all goes well today,

Stay strong, much love and peace.",1525133249

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t"," New glasses \- How do they fit?

Long story short, I have a small face and thick nose, so... It's pretty rough to get decent sized glasses out there.

My    main concern is about the eyebrows, I've found a few ones that are a  better fit around the eyebrows and nose, but then, they're too wide,  and/or end up having a sports guy look \(Oakley frames a\-like\), which is  not really my thing.

Last one fits well, but too wide, just to illustrate.

Also, perhaps this third option, which fits better, but seems a little on the big side:
