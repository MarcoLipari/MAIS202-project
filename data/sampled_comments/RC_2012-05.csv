"Austria","t5_2qo9i","I would definitely add our love to comfort to the list. We are very relaxed, want to be left in peace and don´t look for trouble. Despite of that though, we love big discussions (which usually don´t lead to anything)

I wouldn´t say that we are socially cold. Maybe we take politeness more seriously than other countries (in Germany I noticed a lot more people saying ""du"" than ""Sie"") and we respect other peoples privacy, but when I introduced my Irish boyfriend to my Austrian friends, they loved him straight away and actually paid more attention to him than me... It might be hard to make new friends in Austria as a completely stranger, but you just have to figure out when to talk to people and when not to. My dad is one of those people who just talks to everyone. He talks to a lot of strangers when he´s, for instance, standing in a queue, an elevator, etc. But he would never talk to anyone in the subway, anyone walking down the street, or to a closed group standing around. When we´re in a situation like that we do not want to talk to strangers and it´s hard for me to imagine than anyone would. 

If I compare it to Ireland, where people are more likely to stick with the people and friends they already know, I have to say that Austrian (at least the younger generation) are more open to meeting new people and making close friends with them. We mighn´t be known as the most friendliest people, but that´s a part of our humour and unique charm, and you shouldn´t take it too seriously.  ","1335830400"

I say this again. Biology does not make sense if you assert that evolution isn't true. You can observe evolution in action with bacteria and antibiotic resistance. There is no secular reason that evolution is not valid, and science does not deal with religion. 

If something science has proven contradicts something your religious text asserts, you either have to accept that humans are fallible and the text is wrong, or that you are interpreting the text wrong. The earth is not the center of the universe, and evolution is a proven fact.","1335830405"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; What do you suppose are God's goals? I can imagine at least a couple.

We're not debating the Christian or Catholic, or Jewish, or whatever god you believe in here. We're debating God only in the sense of ""something omniscient, omnibenevolent, and omnipotent, which created the world we live in"", and whether that proposition holds up, that is, whether ""omniscient, omnibenevolent, and omnipotent"" is consistent with ""the world we live in"".

Its goals, whatever they might be are irrelevant for the purpose of this argument.

&gt; One would be to identify people's true natures. Without the ability to make morally important decisions, then we're left short of fulfilling said goal.

An omniscient God doesn't need any such exercises to identify people's natures, it just knows.

I also see no requirement that God must be active. It could be a deist sort, who creates, then just sits and watches.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","""Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that a significant number of our atoms--up to a billion for each of us, it has been suggested--once belonged to Shakespeare.
A billion more each came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven, and any other historical figure you care to name.
So we are all reincarnations--though short-lived ones. When we die our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere--as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew.""

The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.

Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.

What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

How long would it take anyone to realize I’m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn’t object to this?

But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.

When human populations kill and consume these animals with conservation in mind then there is no problem.

There's a fine line between killing an animal for pleasure and killing one for sustenance though. I see absolutely no necessity for an individual to fly halfway around the world to kill an animal and take parts of its dead body back home, just so they can stick them on the wall of their den. 

We don't tolerate humans taking trophies of other humans, so why should it be any different for any other animal?

I was sitting on my couch watching the CSI series on DVD with my sibling around 3 in the morning on June 26. I was in the middle of eating rice krispie's treats. There was a knock on the door, my father answered and two very large people walked in. My sibling went upstairs but I was asked to stay on the couch where I was sitting. That was when my dad told me that I was being sent away and that these two people were here to take me to another state. They didn't tell me much more information other than that I was being sent away for an indefinite amount of time to an unknown destination. From there my mother came down with a backpack that contained some of my belongings. I was forced into a car and driven to the airport. I was told that if I tried to run away, then they would put me in handcuffs and drive the entire way or force me to take a sedative to be more compliant. When we were finally on the way to the airport, that was when I was told what the situation was.","1335830435"

Above all we try to insert the ideas *deeply*, so the victim doesn't merely say : ""given X, Y is logically implied"" - but rather says ""I feel that this is *right* and that is *wrong* and this other thing is *truth*"".

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Alright, I think I've responded to much of that, albeit not directly, but I will take a shot at it here:

&gt;We're left dealing with the consequences via ""charity,"" another human invention which is by nature inefficient and wasteful.

The most efficient form of charity is through friends and family.  And they will often help you out if you get into trouble.

The more local the charity, the better the results.  Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, etc. are much better than sending money across the country or world.  Perfection is impossible, but we can do much better if we are smart about it.

Further, much of the problems that people get into are due to government interference.  Healthcare and higher education is expensive *because of* government subsidies and financial aid schemes.  Homes are more expensive in many areas because of government controls.  Jobs are more unavailable because of government limitations on competition and onerous/expensive taxes and regulations.

&gt;A business will try to submit false evidence, or keep behavior secret, rather than admit to having harmed a human being.

They would do the same thing in government courts.  Private arbitration can take the same measures as government courts.  If they don't agree to private arbitration, the community would ostracize them (boycotts, social pressure, etc.) for not treating others like human beings.

&gt;As human beings (not economic creatures), there is a moral mandate to somehow artificially increase the economic value of economically valueless people just barely enough to ""keep them in business,"" meaning to artificially protect their basic health, survival, and opportunity to become a ""better business"" in the future.

Yes, we ought to help out those that are stuck in dangerous circumstances, if we can.  But we have no right or authority to make others do the same, even if we know they should.

Apparently a black person embracing their culture is an affront to common decency. So sad. You should learn to be more open minded. Don't try to make everyone be the way you want them to be. Just because they don't act like you do doesn't mean there is something wrong with them. People are different, it's very bigoted of you to pretend otherwise. As for the last thing, it's pretty sad that you think going to Canada to study Mexicans is a better idea than going to Mexico to study Mexicans. Perhaps you hate Mexican culture too?","1335830453"

More air in - more air needs to be pushed out.

I would wager if this was a douche cannon setup that it'd probably be chromed, double stacked, and the person driving would probably have a bunch of stickers to add horsepower.

Though, I will be honest there is a cosmetic component that it brings with it is billows of smoke at shows and tractor pulls when the driver changes the tune on the motor to force it to do that. Couldn't say for sure that's why this person has it on their truck.","1335830466"

Studies indicate that Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) possesses various pharmacological activities such as anti-amoebic, antibacterial, antidiarrheal, antifilarial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. Various other effects like antimalarial, antimutagenicity, antimycobacterial, antioxidants, hypoglycemic and neurobehaviorial have also been studied.

Most of the effects seem to be related to neurochemicals but topical application can create some localized effects. That's Aromatherapy massage. They can also affect cell reproduction in various ways.

Listentothis follows [strict submission guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/q0x6q/meta_the_listentothis_rule_review_a_restatement/) decided by the community.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] *anything*
* You *must* include the artist, the name of the track or album, and at least one genre tag.
* There are no exceptions even if this is your own music or a friend's band.
* Avoid gushing about the artist or begging for attention in your titles.
* Try to use [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/), [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/), [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/), &amp;amp; [Grooveshark.](http://listen.grooveshark.com/)
* Do not spam your music blog. Link *directly* to media. Leave your opinions and links to your blog in the comments if you like.

We do not accept these genre tags on their own:

* indie alternative remix mashup cover soundtrack score singer songwriter

If your music is 'indie' then it is actually 'indie rock', 'indie pop', 'indie folk', or 'indie electronic.' Indie by itself tells us nothing useful about the sound. The same goes for the other tags. Meaningful tags are *essential* for scrapers syndicating our content and priming the reddit search engine.

Please resubmit your post following the guidelines and it should be auto-approved within 10 minutes. We're sorry to be so strict about the rules, however it is the only way to maintain order in a subreddit that gets over 200 music submissions a day on average. Posts that break these rules would get downvoted to oblivion anyway - they always have.

Kirkconnell includes, translations, summaries, original quotations...everything.

I found it, actually, while doing a bit of research on *Paradise Lost* and the Caedmonian Genesis, as there is a bit of circumstantial evidence that Franciscus Junius, the owner of the manuscript in the 1650s, and Milton were acquaintances around the time Milton had begun working on PL.

"olemiss","t5_2qrja","Short answer: you're sort of wrong and you're letting preconceived notions about Oxford and the south in general affect your opinion. 

Longer answer: Oxford is a fairly liberal place for Mississippi. Of course there are the booze worshippers and the sex players around, but I imagine you'll find that at many colleges in the SEC.  Oxford is quite a drinking town, I'll give you that. But if you're not interested in that atmosphere it's easy to avoid.  Same goes for the unprotected sex - honestly, I'm not even sure what point you're making with that comment. 

As far as the Bible-thumping conservatism you seem to be so afraid of is concerned, Ole Miss is where I accepted and embraced atheism, and I came from a fairly religious family. I guess how much you're exposed to that depends on your major field (I was a Biology major).

I'm a fairly liberal guy but I really enjoyed my time at Ole Miss. I graduated last May and I still have a few friends there.  I go against the majority opinion when it comes to social issues, (Mississippi IS a highly conservative state), but I never felt like that affected my college experience negatively.  Plus there are a lot of liberally minded people you will meet. That all depends on what groups you try to be a part of. It's very important to find something to do with your time other than sleep/stay in your dorm. Go out and meet people.  

The last piece of advice I have for you is to approach college with an open mind. If you start at Ole Miss thinking that you'll hate it, don't be surprised if it turns out to be that way.  I feel like that could apply anywhere.

The trinity is sort of a later invention intended to justify the monotheistic Christian religion.

Also, while it is painful for anyone to cut down their own writing -- even novelists feel like they're ""killing their babies"" when they delete items -- the more often you check your resume, you will find yet another way to say the same thing in fewer words.

You turn VSync on, and the game limits you to 75FPS. No problem, right? Fixed the tearing issue, it looks better. You get to an area that's particularly graphically intensive, an area that would drop your FPS down to about 60 without VSync. Now your card cannot do the 75FPS it was doing before, and since VSync is on, it has to do the next highest one on the list, which is 37.5FPS. So now your game which was running at 75FPS just halved it's framerate to 37.5 instantly. Whether or not you find 37.5FPS smooth doesn't change the fact that the framerate just cut in half suddenly, which you would notice. This is what people hate about it.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Oh, I absolutely agree. Just off the top of my head:
1. Game times will need to be drastically shortened, as expecting the average person to consistently devote up to a whole hour for a single game is unreasonable
2. Stats and item effects need to be made clearer, so that a person can easily design a build without consulting an online guide
3. Balance between levels needs to be more balanced. In LoL, one of the hardest parts of getting friends to try the game and play with you is that the matchmaking puts them against level 20+ players, all of whom have runes which give them a huge advantage over new players in addition to their experience playing the game. This leads to the new player becoming frustrated at the game, especially after they are inevitably bitched out by their teammates. Which leads to:
4. The community. Jesus. The communities on these games are terrible. Most hyper-competitive gamers on the planet. I'm honestly not sure how they could fix this one. Perhaps by reducing team size and thus encouraging playing more with friends who are less likely to scream at you than online strangers? The competitive nature of the games will naturally draw this type of player, but their presence makes it difficult to attract other, less intense players.

All of these, and I'm sure many more, would absolutely need to be adjusted before the genre is moved into the mainstream. However (with the exception of #4), I see no reason why someone COULDN'T design a game like this, in which new players could easily integrate themselves and learn the game mechanics. Current MOBA games have proven that there certainly is a market and an interest in the genre, and they are the furthest thing in the world from noob-friendly. While it is by no means a certainty that these games will become extremely popular (far from it), I don't think it's likely that the genre to expand with a bit of tweaking to the traditional formula, especially given DOTA 2's impending release. How far this type of game has come from being a simple mod to a major cash cow for RIOT games (and presumably soon Valve) is very impressive.","1335830500"

You both snap to each other and begin shooting.

You--being the more skilled combatant, hit him square in the chest.
Your opponent, who fired at the same time as you did, panicked and missed you, sending a round flying by your ear.

800 milliseconds later, you are dead and your opponent is regenerating his multiple gunshot wounds to the neck and chest.

Why did you die?  Because around the 3rd bullet you traded, you started missing and your panicked opponent started hitting.  You were suppressed and he was not.  

After all--bullets whizzing past your ear scared you and made you unable to aim, but your opponent taking several bullets to the sternum had no effect on his aim at all.

In your example, you were referring to intentional suppression.

In my example, I am referring to unintentional suppression.

It is my example that demonstrates most people's problem with suppression.

I am going to make this as clear as possible--missing in this game can and does result in winning gunfights sometimes (not often, not always, but it does happen occasionally).  When it does happen, it is profoundly frustrating to the more skilled player who has lost.","1335830512"

Too many self-labelled gamers have these ""amazing"" ideas which are really just a bunch of components from different games cobbled together because each of those components was ""cool"". Quality game design isn't taking a bunch of mechanics you think are cool from other games and clicking them together like lego blocks.

I myself was not handing down the pronouncement that Justine was flighty but wrote it in the sense that others in her world would give her that title or something similar as ""normal"" people are want to give out rubber stamped titles to depressed people.

I completely agree with your thoughts on the weeding.  People often see depressed people as selfish but I think that shows that even though Justine doesn't have her shit together as the other people would see it, she still very much cares for those around her.  

To me at least I thought the gist of the movie was about depressed people vs. those that are not and trying to bridge that gap about how they see the world and the utility of those different viewpoints.  Some people say of course homosexuality is unnatural, how could it arise from an evolutionary perspective if one isn't going to procreate?  The problem with that, besides it being jackasses' opinions, is that it isn't about the individual's genes being passed on but the increase in [fitness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29) of the individual's relatives who mostly have the same genes.  I see a corollary with depression.  The movie's situation is the most extreme possibility because there is no hope of survival for anybody but in cases of extreme tumult where there is a chance of survival for some, Claire's being overwhelmed by it all and not being able to transition from a state of everything is hunky-dory to a shit hit the fan state is not as helpful as Justine accepting the situation and doing what needs to be done.  In the case of the movie the only thing that really matters is how you go out and Justine made that a lot easier for the child.                ","1335830515"

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","&gt;1) An enemy in the genroom is an enemy away from your and their flagstand, even if it's just for a while. Just don't waste your precious time by sitting there and camping the genny.

I doubt that. Low level players who mindlessly run to the gen room aren't going to start playing the flags suddenly if you stop distracting them. They will camp the gens anyways, they'll deathmatch in middle, or in the rare scenario that they actually play flags they'll do a poor job at it or just hinder their teammates with llama-grabs and insta-returns. I personally welcome low level players, as a chaser, to try and cap my flag. I let them take it, kill them, and move the flag to a spot where it's practically guaranteed to sit uncontested for 30s+.

&gt;A way to peel defenders off of the flagstand is to 1) kill the engineer on duty (and his friend if he's there), 2) kill the generator, 3) kill the first player that comes in to try and fix the generator (this is to ensure that more enemies will go down and check the situation out) and lastly 4) GTFO (or VVM if you prefer).

In pub play the best way to clear the flagstand is by hitting the flag stand, period. The game is balanced for 7v7 or 8v8, but when the number of players doubles, the size of the flag stand and number of deployables you have to deal with practically stays the same. In 7v7, two or three LO/HO can be effective at clearing the stand. In 16v16 the stand is the same, but you have potentially twice as much firepower raining down onto it. And this honestly isn't so bad if you're dealing with close-range stand clearers, such as raiders. But when you're dealing with juggernauts that take 10+ seconds of travel time to even begin fighting against, and when they're hitting from different angles, shit gets stupid real fast. Move out to kill one, and by the time you've killed the next the first one is already back and has killed your HoF. The average pub player won't even bother fighting against juggernauts for this reason. That's why any pub game where you see three-four jugs, the enemy defense crumbles pretty much instantly. If those juggernauts move into the generator room as infs/raiders, it's no problem for the defense, their HoF doesn't have forcefields but he's still defending the flag just fine.","1335830520"

Which means- and I can't believe this is only now occurring to me- that the most direct, efficient, and realistically achievable way to wipe out the ""sexist"" idea of the friend zone would be to convince men who lament being friendzoned to start thinking of women as disposable, interchangeable vaginas instead of unique individuals.

Torres hasn't in been good form for months. The last month, but he's still got a long way to go before anyone is really convinced. And Lukaku seems to be nothing but potential, nobody at Chelsea seems to trust him to be able to play though so there must be some issues.

Terry was much better at the age that Cahill is now. He isn't going to get much better if at all and he really is 3rd choice CB until Terry doesn't want to/can't play any longer.

But have they really got a 'few good years'? Terry is suffering more injuries and has shown more errors than before. Drogba and Lampard are now closer to 35 and only going downhill from here. They'll still be good and can shine now and then, but not 'PL winning team' good and certainly not the rocks that could be depended on in the past.

Why do sales taxes make it harder? Let's say I'm able to buy a 79 cent pack of gum with gold. If I can do that then why can't I pay the extra 9% sales tax too?

Capital gains... well, I guess. A business will get capital gains from money too. They'll put it in the bank at the end of each week or whatever and start earning interest. Gold appreciates just by sitting there, but is this really a fundamentally different problem?

&gt; On the secondary point, usage is also limited by legal tender laws which make payment of debts in gold unenforceable.

How could it work otherwise? Suppose I have a debt to you. Isn't it a *good* thing that form of payment is set by fiat? I mean, what if you decide that you want payment in something that I can't easily obtain or transport? What if I want to pay in gold you want something else?

So they did the ultrasound first, and after they figured out it was a boy, they started telling her all about adoption and foster care and providing pamphlets and stuff.

Not sure what they're about ... but it's not ""family planning."" Sounded to me like they were engineering a master race.

We decided not to use their services, since they were pretty obviously all about killing the female babies.","1335830536"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","That's an important point! Many people say something similar, sometimes followed by ""I'm not a feminist, I'm a human rights activist"" or something. I believe that is kind of missing the point: feminism does not mean ""feminine rights"" or ""women's rights"", it means to acknowledge that there is a division between genders when it comes to rights and opportunities,^* and that that division should be removed, in law as well as in practice. It doesn't mean you can't also fight for men's rights or PoC's rights or whatever, but a label is necessary simply to signal to the world that you are in fact fighting (however you are). 

Saying people should have equal rights should not have a label, because this is something everyone should say, seems to be your reasoning. However, this does not seem to be the case (there are people who very much oppose equal rights, even in law), so people label themselves to actively show this is what they belive.

^* I noticed you didn't include the ""and opportunities"" part, so I just wanted to point out that equal rights does not necessarily give people equal opportunities. Most self-labeled feminists believe equal opportunity can only be reality if the way people think about gender and opportunity throughout society is changed.","1335830536"

It also turns out my dealer was cutting my meth with heroin, so I had the withdrawal symptoms from that as well. There was no one to blame but myself for my misery, and no one to count but myself to get away from it, which is really what it takes to beat an addiction as strong as the one meth creates.

There isn't any other course of action the OP can take that will have a desirable effect. The more love she tries to show this friend, the more her friend will attempt to use her. It has to be rough on her friend, or she will not have enough reason to walk away from the addiction.","1335830540"

Yes, I get that.

But, Jezebel is still an obnoxious race baiting for the sake of politicaliztion junk rag that shouldn't be given very much credit to do anything except push a hyper liberal attitude.

They profit from inflamatory issues dealing with race &amp; gender and this writer makes some brash insinuations based on their own attitudes and understanding of the issues.

I'm more concerned with her leap of logic that assigns 'thugs' to black culture and the way Hollywood uses genre stereotypes to market a negtive imagetype to white youth who really just emulate what they see in media, as opposed to self constructed attitudes towards other cultures.

White culture is boring as hell. What exactly is white culture? According to the media, it's probably going to church, burning crosses and beating up gay people. Oh, and Justin Bieber.

White kids are the major buyers of 'black' music for decades. That's simple demographics. There's a lot more white people in the US, and black artists have helped form everything from jazz, to rock, to punk, and hip hop. There's even a lot of gospel influences in country music, which is probably the 'whitest' music around.

The real racism is present in these groups that push race issues as a sidecast support for their thing. The writer pushes all kinds of blame on innocent people who are just young and ignorant, while using black people as a puppet issue. It's self serving and manipulative.","1335830542"

It is this low level of maturity that leads to the problems related to sexual activity at that age - whether it's regret turning to rape accusations, an older person taking advantage of a younger, or any of the other issues that can arise.

That said, I am neither an advocate of teen sexuality nor of necessarily lowering the age of consent (although some regions have laws that don't seem to make sense). I am, however, an advocate of promoting a higher level of maturity among our youth.","1335830557"

In the last five years, farmed baby caiman lizards from South America have made their way into the pet trade around the world. These hatchlings are more willing to except other food sources. Even so, these are not an easy lizard to keep in captivity. They have strong jaws that can cause a painful bite. The aquatic life style means they need a large pool or tank, but also need a place to dig and burrow and logs on which to bask. Their need for high humidity and hot basking temps also are hard to accommodate. Combine all that with a animal that will grow 4 feet long, its going to need a large enclosure.

That being said, some owners say there is a reward to keeping them. Caiman lizards are intelligent as can be seen in the way they approach a snail that is clinging to the rocks. They can solve problems and generally can recognize their owners.

They're fairly large, growing to around 4 ft in length and reaching an average weight of 10 lbs.

If that is how you want to use the term, you go right ahead. When most people describe ""intellectual property"" they describe the pattern and not just the physical media. They assert there is some ownership over the pattern. If that is not your view, what is your justification for any actions against third parties copying, sharing, selling ""your"" particular pattern? I can freely download any of your ""intellectual"" property over the internet without violating property rights.

I didn't scan the entire thread looking somewhere for you to present something besides begging the question. And I'm not going to.

&gt;It preserves rights in an area where certain people are inclined to disregard them.

Wait a second, you said there is no independent right in intellectual property. Only the property right of the media it is contained in. Now you seem to imply differently.

&gt;What conclusions

""No such thing as IP."" ""There is IP, you theives."" ""Aggression/theft/blah, blah.""

&gt;I don't get where you see any ""shouting.""

The usage of rhetoric to communicate something more, or less, than literal meaning is lost on you I guess. edit: the point of the usage of the word ""shouting"" is to communicate the discussion is as unproductive as *actual* shouting.

&gt;No one even down voted anyone I don't think, and the only insults I noted were exchanged between you and I

Where did I insult you? You mean when I characterized your arguments with ""duh""? If your arguments are bad, I'm going to present them as such.

&gt;Giving me a vague ""you're begging the question"" is hardly the same as asking a direct question

I guess I expected you to do more thinking. I didn't think I had to type out the error. Looks like that is a typically mistaken assumption of mine.

&gt;You were just playing passive aggressive games with the snide remarks, the vague comments, and the ""duh"" bullshit

Do not imply insults where they are not explicit and grow some skin. Pointing out the errors in your statements and arguments are not the same as ""passive aggressive games"" or ""snide remarks.""

If you're in Toronto I *highly* recommend checking out HAVEN, Nomad, Klaxon Howl, Lavish and Squalor, and Uncle Otis, if just to check for inspiration. I rarely buy clothes from any of these stores unless they're on sale (or if I just have money burning a hole in my pocket, which seldom happens).

I understand completely the sentiment/negativity/scorn one thinks when trying to justify $200 jeans for the first time. But talk to the guys who work here, especially the dudes at Nomad. 9/10 they'll be straight up with you about the quality, and show you the difference, rather than just try to pitch a sale to you. Also, it's a good idea to just observe what *looks good*, rather than blindly purchase, because any of the most fashionable people you'd see will tell you that some of the best finds you'll ever get will almost always be at Value Village or a thrift store.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It kind of feels like the school thinks that way too. I always approach faculty members to discuss how things are done and what could be done to improve things or make them more efficient so we can free up time and facilities to actually do practical things.

Engineering study and concepts are actually really easy, it's just that everyone's so inefficient at disseminating it. I firmly believe that every class I've had could be pared down so that lecture/homework/testing/projects could be completed in 3-4 hours a day for an average-full load with no spill over, given our current level of available technology and advances in teaching methods. I also believe that workload can be made completely time-independent so that studies can mold around more practical work. I'd like to see more schools make practical experience as much of a priority as study, such that every student entering a program is automatically assigned a job in the department (with the option to decline, naturally) starting with basic work that helps repair/maintain the facilities, calibrate/maintain the engineering tools in the building, and working their way up through various experiences until junior senior years where they are assisting professors and grads on research projects or possibly even working on projects that companies can outsource to universities like basic CAD design, machining/fabrication, apprenticeships, etc. At graduation you'd have 4 years of relevant work experience in addition to your studies. All of this exists in some limited form or another, but I still would love to see engineering schools (or others) shift from studies, and whatever you may or may not have time for, to very clear curriculum of both work and study that progress through parallel tracks.","1335830565"

"podcasts","t5_2qh1d","I would say that you shouldn't model your show after anyone else's show, except in the most general of terms. The best way to grow an audience is to be passionate about the topic and make it your own. When I started our podcast: www.thenerdpocalypse.com I decided how I wanted it to sound, and went from there. If you model to closely to someone else you will end up sounding like them, which makes you just another ""Nerdist clone."" There are a lot of nerd podcast, be original.

As far as marketing, go for twitter,facebook, and google+. Tell your friends on each social network and try and build from there. We have been at this for 6 months and our following is growing all the time. Its a long hard road, but constant promotion and passion...real passion makes things work.

Investing money - Invest in equipment that makes the show sound good. Besides this keep it lean. Get a good mixer and microphones. Don't forget pop screens. If you have poor sound quality people won't care to listen. I've gone back to listen to our sound quality in early shows...jesus it sucks. Now it sounds much better.

Side note: I see you are on SoundCloud and Itunes...great. Look into to getting your show on Stitcher Radio. We have gain quite a few listeners from there.

Lastly: DONT STEAL OUR LISTENERS OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN!!!!

SERIOUSLY!

Good Luck. Hope this helps you.","1335830567"

A good thing to remember is that when it comes to antennas, simpler is usually better.  A lot of expensive antennas are just simple dipoles with a lot of futuristic-looking plastic, a built-in amplifier, and a boutique price tag.  Antennas with amplifiers usually cause more problems than they solve and amplification should only be added if adjusting or relocating the antenna won't solve the problem and space or location restrictions won't let you replace it with a better antenna.","1335830567"
"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I don't mind that so much as I mind the fact that it's placed in very specific fighting styles rather than treated as a function of supernatural speed. If they thought Celerity was a problem in Masquerade, I don't see a problem changing it for Requiem, but to then add the same general mechanic into the rules seems counter-intuitive (why not just keep Celerity as it was?).

I guess what really irks me though is that the mechanic was expressed in the rules in such a random way. I can understand Two Weapon Fighting, that makes sense, but why Kung-Fu? Did the write-up in the sourcebook actually come from a study of the fighting style? Or just was one of the writers knew from watching Chinese action cinema? 

I guess it's a personal pet peeve here, I think they dropped the ball completely on fighting styles. The fact that it adds extra attacks while Celerity's extra actions got nixed just smacks, to me, of too many writers not coordinating their ideas. 

As far as mortals getting them, I don't mind that at all. There was a special advantage in Ascension's Right Hand that gave you extra actions, I would let my mortal players take stuff like that if it fit their backstory.","1335830567"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","My feedback is at times necro specific as that is all I played.

- Money too tight at newb levels.. remove tele costs for under 11.
- Necro pets need ooc regen
- Pets and aggro are funky.. pets shouldn't aggro mobs but do and then pet dies as there is no taunt.  I could be standing right next to the mob dealing 10x the damage as the pet and couldn't peel it. 
- A GW1-style pet bar would be welcome.
- Necro underwater weapons\skills are terrible.  Please revisit these.
- Better casting bar and target casting bar please.  Need to see the abilities.
- Conditions\debuffs\boons on me need more visibility\better UI
- Mobs need more abilities\better AI.  Didn't see any mob drop a casted aoe and very few casters in general.  Most all mob groups were melee with ranged (archers) support.  Bosses were mostly melee with big attacks that you dodged (yay anti melee).
- Melee vs. ranged balance needs a lot of work.
- Player damage is way too low.. i.e. fights too long both pve and pvp.
- Bleed\debuff caps invalidate too many skills.
- Overflow isn't well explained (is it a different server?) and the caps seem way too low.  Waiting in line is never fun.
- WvW uplevel needs to allow for traits and scale weapons otherwise uplevels are worthless gimps taking up a cap spot.
- Would like option to queue directly for all styles of pvp so could continue pve'ing while waiting in line.
- Crafting Discovery on the surface is a cool mechanic but we have the internet.. no reason to hide recipes like this.
- Cloth drops are way too scarce compared to leather and both of those are way worse than any of the gathering materials which are easy to collect.
- Repair NPCs need to be everywhere.
- Should have a timered\free hearth to home area.  Didn't even realize this was an instanced zone for me until I out of game searched for dye manufacturer as I had seeds.
- City direction givers are horribly incomplete.
- Levelling in general doesn't feel like you gain much power.  This is caused by skills being weapon-based, scaling (you literally ding and your level doesn't change as you are being scaled down), and traits.  No simple fix here but new skill slots etc. are very infrequent.  Traits add a ton of power in stat boosts overall but the change is very incremental.
- Mob respawn is too high in general.  This might be OK if player damage were upped a bit.  I would often pay to tele out just to avoid tedious backspawn in a small cave.","1335830568"

"skyrim","t5_2s837","It used to be you could make 400 iron daggers to get to level 100 in smithing. Now you need to make about 2400 iron daggers after 1.5 update. The value of the item you create matters now. Making iron daggers is no longer optimal. More expensive the item you create, more experience you gain. Making a Daedric armor piece will give you about 20 times the experience as making an iron dagger.

It's good that you have good smithing enchanted items. But it's only useful for making improvements on armors and weapons, not making them. Improving an item is a very efficient way of leveling up smithing. Improving a daedric armor to legendary gives you as much experience as making a brand new daedric armor.

Some things I make:

If you are going heavy armor, you can make lots of dwarven bows with all the dwarven ingots you get from dwemer ruins. After you make them, make sure to improve them at the grindstone with one more dwarven ingot. Improving an item gives you a lot of experience. It's all about the amount of value you create or the amount of value you add.

If you have transmute spell, making silver and gold jewelry with the gems you find is also very helpful. 

If you are going up the left side of the smithing tree, you can make a lot of money and improve smithing quickly by making steel plate armor after you get advanced armor perk at 50. Steel plate armor has the highest value added ratio of all armor types in the game. That means you can buy the raw material from the blacksmith and make it on the spot, improve it, and sell it back to the blacksmith on the spot for good profit. You need steel ingots, corundum ingots, iron ingots, and leather strips.","1335830586"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","There's a huge problem with source in that it actually doesn't support Valve's method of level design very well. It's strange because Source isn't good at rendering environments with a large horizontal expanse - it only works well for worlds that are more vertical. Count the number of loading screens in Portal 2 (with boxy environments) and Half Life 2's expansive environments. The difference is significant.

Half Life 2's level design *has* to be this way because a lot of its majesty comes from its massive and gorgeous setpieces.

My prediction? The theme of Gordon's Autonomy (or lack thereof) has been constant throughout the series. It's been consistent with the linear (not necessarily bad) style of storytelling. Valve needs a new engine that only requires a few load screens instead of Dozen's. Gordon needs to break free of the G-Man's shackles and Valve needs to deviate from their linear gameplay style. They can't hold out for another revolutionary weapon like the Grav Gun or the Portal Launcher. Both of those will make HL3 a massive success. It's not necessarily a question of an imaginary penis size... Valve needs to eliminate a primary weakness of the amazing immersion they're capable of making.","1335830587"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Three topics here - projecting, hypocrisy, and context. I'll address each in turn.

Projecting : You are projecting because you are ascribing your own opinions onto me. For one I had not criticized Mitchellonfire. You assumed, you -projected- that I was. You did it a second time by assuming that because I commented here that I had a problem with the comments. That's okay (because I do), but because they were not appropriate to that context. I'll address that when we get to context.

Hypocrisy - there is none. I didn't post to /r/funny. I was never hypocritical. As far as I can tell nobody that posted there has posted here. So nobody has been hypocritical. Perhaps you meant another word.

Finally context - His comments were posted to /r/funny. If I had posted a vicious bile-filled anti-feminist rant to /r/funny, I would likely be downvoted there as well. Context matters. You won't see me going to /r/lego and talking about the disgusting nature of circumcision. Similarly you won't see me going to /r/funny trying to be a big downer either. That's why he was downvoted. I've seen plenty of times where critics of /r/mensrights were upvoted, because they were in a reddit conducive to it.

To clarify here - I'm perfectly okay with people looking at feminism and mensrights and saying they have the same sins. That's progress. One of my major fights is to make people realize that feminism is not a holy religion where to speak out against it makes you a sinning misogynistic demon, it is just another ideology and it has an equally legitimate counter.","1335830589"

I tasted the bitter twist stuff, because they were so interesting looking but...but what is that stuff?

I've put in some bai hao yinzhen, bai mudan, I think four or five different Jin Xuans (both flavored and unflavored), The Mountain Tea Co's imperial pearl oolong, jade oolong, 'high mountain oolong', teavivre's Dong Ding (and one of the Jin Xuans is theirs), a muzha tieguanyin from a local shop, some li san, a big handful of earl grey teabags, because they're handy, but I don't use them, some young hyson, and I think at least one more thing, but I can't remember.

On the positive side, it hung around the side of the map where goblins came to play from.

The necromancer got dusted eventually, but not before leading his new army into my fort.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; I'm surely not accountable for [the faults of the Catholic church] after 500 years of separation.

I never said or suggested otherwise. I merely suggested that you share that history, like it or not, and that your particular branch of Christianity came out of that tradition, for all its faults. Most likely, you'd have been a Catholic at the times of each of these past discretions, but that's not especially important; I just want Protestants to stop trying to pretend they're that different from Catholics.

&gt; Whether you believe in the supernatural events or not is non sequitur to the historical fact of the person.

That's not what *non sequitur* means or does. If anything, bringing up the divinity or miracles attributed to Christ counts as a red herring in this discussion, but even then that charge is limp, due to the fact that I explicitly stated that I have no difficulty acknowledging that any number of guys named after Joshua existed in or around Jerusalem in the first century CE. As I said, that's not a problem; it's when divinity and miracles come into the picture that the problem rises, and due to the fact that those are not as easily separable as you might think from the legend of Jesus, some of the stories found in the synoptics are suspect, even where they *don't* get into divinity or assert miracles.

Recognize that there are four different questions being asked when you wonder if I accept the historical existence of Jesus:

1. Did a person with the name Jesus (Yeshua, Yehoshua, Joshua, etc.) exist in the early first century CE?
2. Did a person with the name Jesus and as roughly described (*sans* divinity and miracle claims) in the New Testament exist in the early first century CE?
3. Did a person with the name Jesus and more or less as described in the New Testament exist in the early first century CE?
4. Did a person with the name Jesus and exactly as described in the New Testament exist in the early first century CE?

I understand fully that this question is meant to worry about the first two versions, but the first version is pretty uninteresting -- that's like asking if somebody named Steve existed in the early 21st century in America. Yeah.

The second question gets a bit more interesting, but the answer gets more nuanced: insofar as a 'Steve' existed in the early 21st century, and he bussed tables, played bass in a local band, had a handful of friends and even a decent following for his weekend gigs -- and I can assert with confidence that at least a few such Steves exist in NYC *right now* -- it is unclear to just what extent I should say that the Steves who exist and fit my description are the same ones described in a book I find two thousand years later.

This is where the nuance comes in. While I will grant the existence of one or even up to five Steve-the-bassist/-busboys, I will remain skeptical as to the existence of a Steve-the-bassist/-busboy who was honored in an impromptu parade through Manhattan. If I read a story about *that* Steve, it's not clear that it's the same as any of the five Steves whose existence I've accepted -- indeed, it seems like it's a different Steve entirely. I'm inclined to say that while the impromptu-parade-Steve is *modeled* after an existing Steve, he's nonetheless fictional (assuming I'm correct in my skepticism).

This is my response to question #2; I accept the uninteresting existence of several Jesuses, but the one around whom the legend is built is probably a fictional embellishment of an existing person, and I don't know just where the truth lies.

Now, I know you're not interested in versions #3 and #4, but to give them brief treatment, if I am skeptical as to the veracity of the tales in the *non* divine/miraculous portions, then hell yes I'm skeptical with respect to the magic.

So again, I accept the uninteresting existence of various Jesuses. That's easy. I become more and more skeptical the more you insist that his life matches with the depictions in the synoptics.

&gt; Joshua is not the same.

Sure it is. As I understand it, it's basically the difference between ""Stephen"" and ""Steven."" They're both Steves.","1335830590"

As a person that has also been living with a chronic condition and the depression that seems to tag along, I've been at that point too many times to account for here. Sufficed to say, it is a hellish place to be, and not one I'd wish on any person. The best thing that you can do is what you've already planned to do: live your life to its absolute fullness, and carry the good memories of your mom with you.

One time I was eating in the basement of the Student Union with this guy I liked.  As we were walking out I started feeling sick.  Trying to play it cool, I told him I needed to use the bathroom.  He points to one all the way down the hall and I immediately hurry off towards it, kind of walk-running, still trying to act like nothing's wrong.  When I'm halfway to the bathroom, I start to throw up a little but clamp my hand over my mouth to stop the vomit from coming out.  When I finally get to the end of the hall I see that the sign he thought was for the bathroom, was actually for the elevator.   

I then have to walk back up the hallway past him towards the bathroom, which I can see is actually on the other end where we started out, with my hand still clamped over my mouth and vomit dribbling out through my fingers.  

He still ending up dating me for the last five years though. So, it obviously wasn't too traumatic for either of us. ","1335830603"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The problem I have - as someone smaller than the average US woman, judging by that infographic, but larger than the main sizes sold - is that there's a *gap in the middle as well*.

Many ranges (here in Australia) only go up to UK/Aus size 14 (US10)  Some go up to 16 (US12), but not always generously so.  As soon as you want a clothing range that embraces 16(US12) and 18(US14) you face two problems:

 - you're pushed onto a range that *starts* at that size
 - all the clothes in that range are for *fat* women, rather than *big* women, or specifically women who are big in certain places (bust, or hips)

A huge part of the problem is that most designs just don't account for the fact that women are getting bigger, not just fatter.  Height isn't such an issue because so many women tend to wear heels, therefore even an average-to-tall-height woman who doesn't wear heels will tend to find trousers that are long enough and even too long, since designers accommodate heels.

But whereas bra manufacturers have finally realised that bigger cup sizes are needed, not just bigger back sizes, clothing manufacturers still assume that someone with a 34F bust must have waist-girth slightly larger than the Titanic.

That's why I really appreciate brands like [Pepperberry](http://www.bravissimo.com/pepperberry) which allow someone to buy a clothing size that relates to a specific part of their body.","1335830607"

Being idiots, a few of us decided to throw him a blanket party after a party we knew he'd be at. We didn't kick his ass nearly as much as he deserved -- black eye, split lip and some bruises. Left it with ""if you ever touch so-and-so again, we'll be back"". Felt really bad-ass at the time.

Backfired incredibly. He played the sympathy card with the sister, who immediately fell into a weird mix of Stockholm Syndrome and Nightingale syndrome, fussing over this jackhole's little bumps and bruises. The guy played it up for weeks, and of course by then everybody figured it was us who'd done it so we couldn't possibly get away with a repeat performance.

The defense attorney is, first and foremost, an agent of the accused: a professional sworn by oath to act in the *defendant's* best interests — not the interests of justice, nor fairness, nor his own ideals.

Fairness in such systems is possible only if the defendant has a professional, acting in their best interests at all times, to balance the State's interest (and ability) to prosecute.  Otherwise, the defendant is bringing a knife to a gunfight.

""Zealous defense"" means a lot more than ""doing the work,"" as this author's sleight-of-hand would reduce it to:  It means doing one's best to serve the interests of your client, whether you think those interests are fair or not.  It is both unethical and immoral for ""fairness"" to factor into a defense attorney's considerations at all: *that* assessment is the province of the judge (on matters of law), the jury (on matters of fact), and the prosecutor (as an agent of the State's justice, on whether it is just to proceed with prosecution in the first place).

The defense attorney's primary interest is not to achieve a ""fair"" result, it is to achieve the *best* result.  Yes, fairness is obviously a factor in determining the likelihood of success (and the wisdom of plea offers), but I find that this author equivocates the two in a way that I consider unprofessional and, frankly, dangerous.

I certainly wouldn't want this guy as my defense attorney.

EDIT:  As **pedleyr** rightly points out in a comment below, I should have added that every lawyer's duty is first to the Court and its rules.  A defense attorney cannot, for example, knowingly allow the Court to be misled or lie in service to his or her client.  Please read the above in that context!

EDIT 2: I spent a bit of time writing a response that expanded on some of the above, but it was buried deep in a comment thread.  So, [click here for Part 2!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/t07if/why_do_we_defend_guilty_people_an_article_by_a/c4joh3t)","1335830611"
"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","I was at work and suffered my first migraine. I blacked out and was taken to the ER - routine MRI didn't reveal anything. Migraines persisted for the next few days, so I went back and saw a neurologist.

He pulled up my MRI scans and said, ""That's not good. Wait here; I'll be back."" I was left in that room for twenty minutes solid, and when he returned he showed me the aneurysm. The imaging staff in the ER had missed it :-/

My migraines were unrelated to the aneurysm (after months of investigating, we discovered that my car had been leaking small doses of carbon monoxide).

That's the real terrifying aspect of aneurisms: generally, the first warning someone gets is that they die. I'm one of the very-few people who has been diagnosed early (or at all).","1335830611"

Retrospective (00:00)

- First ScalaDays in Lausanne (2010), sold out with 150 attendees. Scala 2.8 was announced.
- Second ScalaDays in Stanford (2011), sold out with 260 attendees. Commercial support, Typesafe Stack with Scala 2.9 and Akka 1.1.
- Third ScalaDays in London (2012), sould out with 400 attendees. Typesafe Stack with Scala 2.9.2, Akka 2.0, Play! 2.

Where we are now (05:45)

- Scala 2.10 on the horizon, basically feature-complete.
- Refinements, testing and release, will happen in the next months.

Scala 2.10 overview (06:20)

- Lots of work on tooling: Eclipse, IntelliJ, ... more features, better performance.
- Low-level concurrency framework in the standard library (Futures and Promises), used by both parallel collections and Akka.
- Native reflection framework.
- A few new language features.

Reflection Framework overview (08:05)

- Cake pattern has a central role, improvements in 2.10 (dependent method types) make it more useful.
- Compilers and reflection are quite similar: Both need to deal with the same concepts, answer similar questions.
- Differences between compilers and reflection: Where does the information come from?, Generate code vs. invoke pre-generated code, error messages vs. exceptions, thread-safety, (im)mutability of types, ...

Reflection in 2.10, demonstration (12:05)

Mirror-based reflection (16:50)

- Mirrors return the reflective information of runtime values.
- Different mirrors can provide different characteristics.
- Types of different mirrors are enforced to be incompatible with each other: Reflects the design of VMs that for instance even the same types on different machines are distinct.
- Common supertype allows reasoning about all mirrors.

Implementation of reflection (18:30)

- Functionality for trees, symbols, types, names.
- Functionality to decompose and explore relationships between them, ...
- Roughly equivalent to the core of the language specification and the core of the compiler.

Comparison with Java (19:15)

- Java has a quite complex type-system since Generics were introduced.
- What is Java's approach? Pretty much empty interfaces, no useful methods defined.
- Want to do anything non-trivial with types in Java? Write your own compiler/type-checker!
- Why was it done this way? Would have required to write essential parts of a compiler (hard) and to make sure both compilers always agree (almost impossible). Smart decision of the Java designers to not suffer this maintenance nightmare.

Scala's approach (22:00)

- Unify the core parts of compilers and reflection.
- Compiler architecture: Object-oriented encapsulation, separation of concerns. Use a cake pattern in which every component has a self-type that contains all its required dependencies (""Slices of the cake"").
- How to integrate reflection? 
 - Multiple cakes: compiler cake (`scala.nsc.Global`) and reflection cake (`scala.reflect.runtime.Mirror`) inherit from common super-cake (`scala.reflect.internal.Universe`), which captures common information.
 - Refactor common functionality into super-cake, let individual cakes handle differences (e. g. compiler cake: IO, reflection cake: thread synchronization)
 - Refine super-cake (`scala.reflect.internal.Universe`) by providing a cleaned-up facade to the user on top, `reflect.api.Universe`.

- Java's interfaces not enough, Scala leverages abstract types to both present a convenient interface to the user and allow elegant/efficient implementation behind the scenes.

Reflection summary (29:50)

- Scala is a pretty regular language:
 - Everything can be nested: Classes, methods, objects, types.
 - Everything can be abstract: Methods, values, types.
 - Type of `this` can be declared freely to express dependencies.
 - Enables expression of cake hierarchies for software design in the large.

Macros overview (30:50)

- Once reflection and compilers are unified – what can we do now?
- What happens when the compiler itself can make use of reflection?
 - It can call user-defined methods during compilation, which can consume/produce trees/types.
 - This leads to a simple macro system, which is included as an experimental feature in Scala 2.10.

Macro definition (32:40)

- Standard Scala methods declaration with all the same rules for overloading/overriding/... + implementation part which points to a concrete, stable macro implementation. Both have standard Scala method signatures.
- Types are lifted from `T` to `Expr[T]`, which can be described as an AST which, when run, produces a result of type `T`.

Macro expansion (34:35)

 - If the compiler encounters a macro application during type-checking, it will first type-check the arguments (as usual), expand the macro application by doing a reflective call to the macro implementation with the context (call site info) and the AST. Then the macro implementation runs and produces a tree, which will be taken as a replacement of the macro application and type-checked again.

Macro example (35:55)

Expressing syntax trees (37:00)

- Scala provides no special/new syntax. Writing down syntax trees might be cumbersome, but there is actually a better way to do it without introducing special syntax.

Contexts (40:00)

- A macro context contains a mirror (in this case the current compiler instance) that anchors trees, types which are being passed in and out of the macro.
 - Also contains information about the macro call.

Hygiene (41:25)

- Lot of hard work in the Scheme community in the 80ies to avoid hygiene issues.
- Scala's macro system is trivial, does nothing more than accepting trees/types and producing trees again, not hygienic. ""Not so good.""
- Real motivation for macros was `reify`: Takes expression of type `T` and produces a tree representing this expression of type `Expr[T]` at runtime.
 - For example to create a query from filter/map expressions.
 - See also LINQ on .NET.
- `reify` can be (and is) implemented as a macro, enables composition.
- `reify` and `eval` are inverses, `reify: T =&gt; Expr[T]`/`eval; Expr[T] =&gt; T`.
- `reify`( and `eval`) enable:
 - Splicing.
 - Hygiene enforcement, types will prevent mistakes.
 - No need for special syntax for syntax trees.

Macro summary (51:55)

- Very nice syntax and hygienic macros without much effort.
- Cost/benefit ratio is huge.
- Bootstrap operation: Minimal, unhygienic macro system -&gt; Reification as a macro -&gt; Code-as-syntax-tree + hygiene.
- Macros are a better solution than compiler plugins, because APIs are kept stable.

Language features overview (54:00)

- Scala Improvement Process (SIP) with a lot of community involvement.
 - SIP11: String interpolation
 - SIP13: Implicit classes
 - SIP14: Futures and Promises
 - SIP15: Value classes
 - SIP17: Type Dynamic
 - SIP18: Language modularity
- Small additions, but interesting implications.

SIP11: String interpolation (54:50)

- Constructing strings with `+` is very cumbersome.
- Embedded strings would be rather nice, but it is not possible to just reinterpret `$`, because it is already a legal symbol inside a string.
- Syntax is itself extensible: `id""...""` gets translated to `StringContext(""..."").id(&lt;args&gt;)`.
- Enables format strings, embedded XML, JSON, SQL, Scala, JavaScript, ... just provide an appropriate method on `StringContext`.

SIP13: Implicit classes (59:50)

- ""Everyone got extension methods! Why doesn't Scala?"" – ""Actually you want implicits, because implicits can not only add methods but also implement new interfaces, and in mature software systems methods exist for a purpose – to implement interfaces.""
- Scala 2.10 completely eliminates syntactic and runtime overhead of implicits:
 - Syntactic overhead, adressed by SIP13: Implicit classes
 - Runtime overhead, addressed by SIP15: Value classes
 - Risk of misuse, adressed by SIP18: Language modularity
- Before: `class Bar(foo: Foo) { ... }` + `implicit def fooToBar(foo: Foo) = new Bar(foo)`
- After: `implicit class Bar(foo: Foo) { ... }`

SIP15: Value classes (63:50)

- Drop restriction that user-defined classes have to (explicitly or implicitly) inherit `AnyRef` (`java.lang.Object` in Java).
- Scala classes can now also inherit from `AnyVal` (only `Int`, `Long`, etc. could inherit from `AnyVal` before).
- `AnyVal` classes have no object identity and only allow a single public value.
- Instances of those classes can be created and destroyed by the compile at will – basically as transparent as boxing/uunboxing in Scala before.
- Methods of `AnyVal` are compiled down to extension methods (""static"" methods in Java class files).
- Combination of implicit and value classes results in both efficiency and conciseness of extension methods with all the advantages of implicits.

Summary (66:15)

- Scala has grown to an accepted and popular technology for scalable applications.
- Development continues at a rapid pace – both at the language and the middleware level.
- Invaluable community involvement in refining the language and its libraries.","1335830621"

&gt;According to wiki ([1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future) there will be an iceage in 50,000 years. 

That's not correct. Orbital (Milankovitch) forcing conditions favoring another glacial maxima will occur (although the exact timing is an area of considerable debate- the 50ka number is by no means a certainty), but because we've increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations so much, we've effectively precluded a return to glacial maxima conditions for the foreseeable future. 

&gt;In theory will humanity be wiped then?

The glacial maxima have significant climatic and ecological consequences, but they don't tend to precipitate extinctions. Anything that's been alive during much of the Pleistocene has as a species survived multiple glaciation cycles. 

I have to wonder whether you may be thinking more of the ""Snowball"" glaciation events rather than orbitally-driven glacial maxima. ","1335830622"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","&gt; Mass Effect 3 had me SUPER excited to not only see what my squad mates were up to after we all destroyed the collectors, 

Similar to this, with Diablo 3 coming up, I'm interested to see what all of the characters from D2 are now doing.

In the second game, three of the bosses were the original classes from the first game... The ""Dark Wanderer"" that later becomes Diablo was the Warrior, ""Blood Raven"" from Act 1 was the Rogue, and ""The Summoner"" from Act 2 was the Sorcerer. All three characters had been driven mad by having to deal with Diablo in the first game.

So I'm interested to see what the 7 classes from the second game become in the third game. It's not like I really care about their ""back stories"" or anything like that, and I'm not ""emotionally invested"" into them either like I would be in a game like Mass Effect with its characters... I'm just curious, that's all... So far, all I really know is that the Barbarian from D3 is the same from D2... So that's one down, 6 more to go.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;One of the very first transcontinental highways in the U.S was built with private money.

It was also built with significant public money, and maintenance of it was done by the government.

&gt;Where do you think the money for the subsidy comes from? It comes from the same people you're claiming are saving money by paying it. 

Yep, it's a form of cost-shifting. You could argue most service costs utilize a form of cost shifting. Generally speaking, the people who benefit most from these subsidies are the ones who can least afford to pay for the services. Before you say that electricity and water are a luxury, and if it were the 1800's I'd agree - People freeze to death and die of heat stroke every year because they couldn't pay. Are you comfortable with people dying simply because they couldn't afford not to?

&gt;In other words, the government will build a dam even if building the dam results in a net loss. I agree. 

No. I'm saying that something like the hoover dam, which no business person in their right mind would undertake. You really need an entity which is not very profit sensitive to start projects of this magnitude with a very long-term payoff. Otherwise, companies are beholden to their stockholders. And telling them ""No, no, really. This $690M (In today's $) will pay out in 30-40 years. Trust me."" would get them laughed right out of the shareholder meeting (Assuming that's the appropriate place to discuss it, which it likely isn't). But, a government? Typically a government has no problem laying out that sort of money for the betterment of the citizenry it represents. Even if the return takes 30-40 years, the impact to the people is immediate.

&gt;You're ignoring the fact that more industrialization means more people getting out of poverty. 
You're ignoring a few hundred years of de jure slavery in the form of indentured workforce working for barely livable wages. Look at the biggest companies now, and how they treat their workers. And you think *less* regulation is going to make them *better*? Very funny.

&gt;Are you arguing that the gigantic U.S. military is a net benefit? I hope not. 

No, I'm saying that in order to have this standing military, you need a large source of income. I'm actually against a large military spending. I'd rather trade it with NASA's budget. At least then, the work done is public knowledge for more or less the public good.

That you were fortunate enough to be born in a country where upward mobility is possible (a subject upon which Barack Obama can speak with the authority of experience), but where the channels making such upward mobility possible are being increasingly clogged. That it’s not fair to ask the middle class to assume a disproportionate amount of the tax burden. Not fair? It’s un-fucking-American is what it is.

""There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop.

"bjj","t5_2qn02","I did Krav Maga during my military shift for a few years, and just had started BJJ. I was out partying at a bar and someone just stumbled into me, said ""Hey man, got some cash for a brother?"" I just turned around and ignored the obviously drunk comedian.

Later that evening, I was about to leave, I ran into him again. He was angry and asked me to take it outside. So we went outside but instead of fighting him I apologized and walked away. He was infuriated and tried to perform some flying kick which didnt land. 

I faced him, he tried to throw an overhand, I grabbed it, bend his wrist, kicked him in the groin area 4 or 5 times, kneed his head and brought him to the ground face first while still controlling his wrist. 

The BJJ part of the story is the one where I just walked away. Its probably one of the most important things BJJ taught me, to control my temper.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Lately I've pushed a friends account from 770 to 1300 ELO.
So I'm going to try to explain the ELOs from the viewpoint of an 1800s guy.

770-1000: They're all bad, but when they see that you are doing well, they do everything you tell them, which makes it kind of easy to carry a game. Even when you are playing 4v5, your mates just have to stay focussed. (I went straight to 1000 ELO without losing a single game)

1000-1100: Mostly new guys who are about to hit sub 1000 ELO, some of them have plenty of normal games and ocassionally flame and blame others for losing a match.

1100-1300: This, to me, is the worst ELO. All kinds of players get mixed together, ragers who just dropped from ~1400, new people, general trolls and smurf accounts throwing games because ""they don't care about this account""

1400-1600: The ""I am the only one who can carry you noobs"" ELO, most of them don't listen to you. They don't try to take objectives such as dragon, enemy blue or baron. Furthermore, many games are thrown because of plain and simple greed. You may also meet ragers who dropped from 1600 to 1500/1400, etc. In this ELO I have also met alot of people who main supports.

1600-2000: Plenty of smurfs throwing cause ""you don't deserve to win this"". On the other hand alot of helpful and talkative players who try to explain to you why you shouldn't do something or why you shouldn't have gotten a bad item. Also, I think they ping alot. I call this the actual tryhard elo. The guys who don't smurf know they can be higher than 1800 and do their best to get a higher elo.

2000-2300 (I know this from a friend) : Heimerdinger, Katharina, Poppy only players who play them on any lane, fail horribly when playing anything else. Trolling each other because you don't like each other. One game my friend got a loss forgiven, because the servers went off for no reason. The next day he played with a guy from the enemy team and the guy threw the game, stating ""He didn't deserve the loss forgiven"".","1335830654"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Being forced to go to church doesn't have to be terrible, depending on how it happens exactly:

My father was Catholic and insisted I go to church until I was 18 (at which point I told him I was finished and stopped going).  But he allowed me to attend a different Mass than he did.  He went at 9, I think, and there was another at 11, so I was allowed to sleep in a bit.

So from age 13 or 14 until I was 18, (we're talking about 1993-1998) I would get dropped off (later on I drove myself) to church at 11.  Then, I would meet my friend Justin, whose parents did the same thing with him, in the vestibule at the back of the church--where we'd each stand and wait for the other.  He and I would walk to 7-11, buy Snapples, drink them while we walked along the nearby railroad tracks, have a cigarette, and then smash the bottles on the rocks.

We would make our way back to the church just as everyone was getting Communion.  We'd walk up, take our Communion, and get out maybe 10 minutes later, where our parents would pick us up.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","There is a lot of common ground between Icelandic law, and English and American common law. As I see it, this was basically a civil trial for impeachable offenses, ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" in the originally intended sense of the US constitution.  Even though he had already been voted out of office, he could still be tried, which is a more ancient tradition than the standard in the USA, which is to forgive and forget once the person's term has expired.

He was only convicted of the ~misdemeanor charge, of not holding enough cabinet meetings during the worst of the crisis. 

To me that seems pretty fair.  How could such a tiny country have done much, when faced with a global crisis.  Fortunately, the people voted in to replace his government, a coalition of Social Democrat-Left-Green parties, has done the best job of any nation in the world, when it comes to recovering from the crisis.

Not only do I think the US banks should have been allowed to fail, as was done in Iceland, I think the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the  US President at the time of the crisis (Bush), should have been made to stand trial before a tribunal to answer for their actions.  The main problem with this is that the Republicans, the next time they got power, would have perverted the mechanisms of accountability, and used it for a silly publicity circus.","1335830655"

This kind of makes me feel as if it is more that Ayn Rand is the problem with Objectivism, and not Objectivism itself. However, again, perhaps it is that I do not know enough about Objectivism or that perhaps the statement, 

&gt; ""...proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's happiness (or rational self-interest)...""

Instead of purchasing purposed heatsinks, I wrapped some pennies in electrical tape, dabbed thermal paste on them, and put them over the heatsink pad areas.

&gt; yeah, connor and i went back and forth on this a bunch. trees just never fit well in our grinding tech, we probably shouldnt have had them at all. they really are more of a sim snowboarding standard than something that belongs in SSX. unless they are giant, mutant bent up redwoods or something.

**[Question](/r/IAmA/comments/t09os/_/c4ihm0h?context=1) (SavouryLobster):**

&gt; I'd love to know if there is any chance you guys will create a realistic snowboarding game. Shaun white did not come close to making a realistic snowboard experience and, stoked, both big air and original were not fun. Maybe a game mode or something to turn off uber tricks and spin and flip a bit slower? I understand Cuz from skate was on the ssx team so he would be a great help in creating a realistic snowboard game with the same design as skate. I know many other snowboarders would love to hear your opinion on this.   

**[Answer](/r/IAmA/comments/t09os/_/c4iicpp?context=1) (kingbitty):**

&gt; i don't think we would ever turn ssx into a sim snowboarding game, but we certainly have the core tech to build an awesome one. no plans to do so at this time though as far as I am aware.

So you have Pikachu, Tauros, Crobat, and **Croconaw**. Why... Why did you not evolve it?!

That leaves one space open (if you really want to use the Dratini). What I used was Ampharos, good backup and all-around Electric type. Since you already have a Pikachu, that shouldn't be a problem. Other Pokemon I had included Noctowl and for some reason, Arbok and Pidgeot.

I'm not sure what your Pikachu can do; I'd suggest teaching it all its moves and evolving it. 

Tauros doesn't seem to have many good moves in Gen2. You might want to replace him with something else.

Crobat is a good choice, and Croconaw should be evolved. If you really can't find something, use your Suicune.

The Elite Four consists of a Psychic user, a Poison user, a Fighting user, and a Dark user, along with Lance the Dragon user. I advise you to use types or Pokemon with moves of those types, to create an advantage.

Thus the more wealthy you are the less you benefit from the reduction in value of your debt.

2) You do have a point there.  They do win slightly in a reduction in value &gt; foreclosure but the concept of devaluing the dollar will hurt them as the dollar is what they deal with.  It's not a pure loss stance because of the aforementioned silver lining.","1335830672"

But it just so happens that the Temple ruins are just barely on the Palestinean side of Jerusalem, with only the Western wall poking into Israel. Oh, and the Arabs built a fairly important mosque on top of it, the al-Aqsa mosque, where the profet Muhammad went on a dream horse once. So the Temple can't really be rebuilt, and Jesus can never return, and the kingdom of God won't come, without the Jews taking over eastern Jerusalem, and then tearing down this really important mosque, most likely leading to all out war between Israel and the entire Arabic world. But you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs, can you?

So these are the obstacles for Jesus to come back and save the world. After that, of course, all the Jews would burn in hell for not believing in Christ, but until then, they're our friends.

&gt;and if the team were to leave it would end up being a net negative in relation to the new stadium deal.

You understand this is an incredibly lofty claim, right?  I have a feeling that at this point you're speculating based on personal bias.  Do you have some solid numbers to back up claims like this?

Once again - I feel I need to throw out the fact that I want the Vikes to stay, but as someone with a career and education with Economics I'm seeing *a lot* of hot air being thrown around as if fact simply because people want it to be true.  From a professional economists point of view, public stadium financing being beneficial to a city and state is tenuous in a best case scenario - and a complete myth in a worse case one.

What makes a city and obviously a state vibrant and financially relevant in a modern first world setting is it's ability to court business that provides for a plethora of stable careers and a product that will always be in demand.  A $550 million dollar investment into a sports franchise is the antithesis of that line of thought.  The amount of full time careers coupled with the product output of the Minnesota Vikings is minimal.  A lot of merchandise and ad revenue will be sold - but a very small fraction of that will actually go back to the city of Minneapolis, the state of Minnesota, and her citizenry.  By contrast take for example the incredibly small taxation we have of the bio-medical field coupled with public funding of post secondary education in that category.  That has made Minnesota a highly valuable place to house one's biomed business.  Boston Sci being an East Coast company has a major campus here.  Medtronic's main campus and entire business is based here.  The Mayo Clinic is one of the leading medical institutes in the world.  Those type of investments provide Minnesota with a product, careers, and revenue.  Unfortunately the Vikings seem to merely provide us with distraction, a number of part time seasonal jobs, and polarized denizens.  

Though I do truly hope you can prove me wrong or point me in a more pragmatic direction with some numbers to back it up so I can actually support this measure with good conscience.  ","1335830681"

The money spent ""making sure the workforce is educated"" benefits the ""workforce""! Yes, businesses benefit as well but it is absurd in the extreme to only reference the benefits to job creators and call that benefit ""disproportionate"". And by the way, companies PAY THEIR WORKERS. So, the WORKERS are given the education and then turn around and charge businesses for their skills.... how is this disproportionately beneficial to employers?

It is disingenuous to say that an educated workforce is a ""benefit"" to employers. They are directly paying those educated workers.... THAT is how they pay for the privilege of having educated workers. It is NOT a benefit given to them through tax dollars, it is an asset they pay for directly through wages.

Infrastructure benefits everyone equally. Regulations are enforced on behalf of ALL citizens equally. Where are you getting this ""disproportionate"" crap? How do dams and roads disproportionately benefit the rich? But Mitt Romney is paying about 500 times more than me. I sure as hell am not going to claim he's not paying enough... I'm not a jackass. My head won't fit that far up my ass. I don't know how Obama does it.

Bailouts and subsidies are WRONG and are tools of the left. I won't say that Paul Ryan would never support TARP style bailouts because politics is strange but they are contradictory to free market ideals. Remember, while it is true that Bush signed TARP, the bill was passed by congress with a majority of congressional republicans voting against it.

If you don't like bailouts and subsidies, vote Republican.

How is it logical for job creators to pay more for stuff we all use equally? You haven't made your case.","1335830682"

This next bit sounded utterly ridiculous when I was typing it out, and I realize it might make me sound like a ""crazy dog lady,"" but bear with me. There's a specific exercise technique that I've found to be particularly pee-inspiring. Whenever you're moving, keep it brisk. Running/jogging is best. Then, stop every few minutes where you think other dogs are likely to have peed recently. Make sure the leash is hanging loose, tell her once to go potty, and then totally ignore her. Pretend she isn't even there. Don't talk to her or look at her. Wander around slowly, lazily meandering a few inches at a time, looking at the ground as if you're a dog looking for a good spot. Stop occasionally and examine things on the ground. 5 minutes later, if you're both bored, jog on to the next spot. She'll pick up the routine quickly and start to relax and sniff at the stops.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I'm sorry that you feel that way.  I'm bisexual and I'm often so confused about which feelings are real that I wish I was just one or the other.  Being different is really hard.  I think the word ""normal"" is misleading, though.  It's just the most statistically significant property of any group.  No one person is completely ""normal"". Some people have mental illnesses, others have profoundly high IQs.  Some people are attracted to the same gender, even!  It's ""normal"" to be abnormal in some way, and the hardest thing about life is that we don't get to choose how we're abnormal.

You seem to have a conditioned response when you feel attraction or even are reminded of your preference; when you see someone attractive you immediately think bad thoughts.  This is a way of repressing yourself, as you can imagine.  When I see women, or even straight couples in public I get disgusted, simply because I feel like a failure of a man because I am unable to like women or interact with them like other people (although I'd totally bang them if given the chance).  I think repressing your ability to feel attraction is hurting you a lot, because the capacity or potential to love is really necessary to be happy and you are rendered unable to do so.  Thinking about what causes these feelings and talking about with someone would help you a lot.

Also, this is cliche, but it's really easy to be gay in NYC, especially lower Manhattan.  I'm pretty sure NYU is like 40% gay (In all seriousness).  Hell, I went to High School on 16th street and there are two gay clubs just within the 2 block radius!  Now that I am in college in WI I can see how hard it is when there are fewer openly gay people and clubs and bars that facilitate meeting other guys.

"politics","t5_2cneq","maybe you arent solidified in your own views, but you repeatedly cited campaign contributions as a source of your displeasure with politics. for example, you said:

&gt; If they got a greater return from investing in people and research than purchasing politicians, then the rational decision would be invest in where the greatest return is. As it is now, it's about 1000:1 return if you ""contribute"" to a campaign. There is no other opportunity on the planet that gives you that sort of return on your money.

that would suggest there should be some limitation on campaign contributions to prevent that sort of corruption, but then you say:

&gt; i should be able to donate my money to groups that will agitate and advocate on my behalf. 

donating money to a group or politician is a campaign contribution though, right? so where is the limit that you previously suggested should be in place in order to prevent your cited 1000:1 return that comes from purchasing access and the inevitable kickback that comes via contributions?

&gt; How is expressing my political views ""controlling elections""?

money is controlling elections, not political views. money flows to both parties, this is why politicians pander to those with the most money and why, for example, banks throw plenty of campaign contributions to both sides, insuring favorable treatment regardless of who the figurehead is in power.

&gt; How is me running a political ad controlling an election?

because unlimited ads means politics go to the highest bidder. most people get their political information from the media, unlimited money pouring into political ads means the office goes to whoever spends the most. this is partially why presidential elections are now costing over $1 billion, and why the media is greatly in favor of heavily divise and outrageous showbusiness politics.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","**Ruling on teaching in a Christian school**

Islam Q&amp;A

islam-qa.com/en/ref/104002/



Is it ok to teach at a catholic school?.

Praise be to Allaah.

The shar’i ruling differs depending on the state of the school referred to in the question. 

1.

If it is a religious school, in the sense that it was established to produce priests, monks and nuns, and it is working to establish a new generation of this class of people, then we do not think that you should work there, and we can only advise you to be cautious and to keep away from it, even if you are being called to teach other, secular subjects, because by taking part in working with them you will become part of their institution, and it is as if you are helping them in their kufr which they want to teach to the children. 

2.

But if it is an ordinary government school, but has a Christian administration that wants to teach the Bible, and it is limited to that, then in that case there is nothing wrong with you working there and becoming part of the faculty, so long as you adhere to the commands of Allaah and observe proper Islamic hijab, and perform all acts of worship on time, and have a good attitude and treat others well, and avoid forbidden things, one of the most serious of which is loving the kuffaar, feeling comfortable with them and imitating them.  

When working with them, you should be keen to spread the truth and call people to it, and rid whoever you can of the darkness of ignorance and shirk. But if the school requires you to do any Christian acts of worship or traditions, or it is mixed (men and women together), or you fear that you may be dazzled by specious arguments as the result of mixing with the Christians, then in that case it is not permissible for you to work there, and you should not continue to do so, rather you must leave and shun it for the sake of your religious commitment and so as to protect yourself from falling into the traps that the shaytaan sets for the sons of Adam. 

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al‑Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al‑Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allaah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allaah is All‑Hearer, All‑Knower”

[al-Noor 24:21] 

We should not forget to point out here the danger of these schools when they are opened in Muslim countries; in that case they are a tool of colonization by stealth, and an obvious means of corruption, concerning which many fatwas have been issued by scholars and academic institutions from the time when they were first established. 

And Allaah knows best.

As for the point about Ryan not fully hashing out the specifics of the tax deduction reforms, is that really fair? I admit I'm not the expert on this and am just trying to learn, but, at least Ryan has released a pretty comprehensive plan to the public. Until the Democrats release a comparably detailed plan then I don't think that it is fair to get on Ryan's case about leaving out exact details. From what I gather (from what you said in previous post), all the Democrats have done is participated in unfruitful negotiation behind closed doors.

Well, as for Dyrus I have never been a big fan of his.  I think he is overrated, and always have. He has strong game sense, but to mechanics are average and he is a follower when it comes to game theory.  

For HSGG I have never thought he was the strongest player on CLG nor the the strongest top laner in competitive play.  He has a weak hero pool to start with, and even some of his heroes he is not even the best with them.  Once you push him off of Nid and Cho his impact drops significantly.

I'm not saying pirate screen flow but right now I'm not sure if it's worth the bucks.

He was already retired when he went blind, but I could still hop on him and do everything I'd like to with him. He went out with other horses and avoided any obstacles just fine.

The horn method around the fingers is (I believe) fine, in fact the link I put has a link suggesting using exactly OPs method. But again, the problem are the last few steps.

Reason #2: his ganks lvl 1-5 are horrible... he has to walk up to you with red buff to do anything. In the long run this will make you a weak jungles as you will tend to just farm the jungle thinking that you can't gank until level 6... meanwhile faster jungles are wrecking your lanes.

A Level 2 or 3 gank on the top lane can single handedly win the lane if the enemy team does nothing to correct the advantage... you can force the enemy to blow sumonors, pots, or even cause first blood... not with warwick.

Move on to one of the following Junglers: Lee Sin, Shyvanna, Uydr, Mundo.

All of them clear the jungle farm more faster.. and can start enemy wraiths / red for a lvl 2 or 3 gank.","1335830728"

"ruby","t5_2qh21","Hmm. 

I agree that Rails pattern of sharing state with views through iVars is terrible. It's gotten me into trouble before, it can be confusing to debug and maintain. 

That part can of course be fixed without going all the way here. 

I'm not sure there's anything wrong with before_filters. They're awfully useful, and have never gotten me into trouble before. 

While I see how this is, in some ways anyway,  in theory a 'purer' OO design, I'm not sure it's worth it.  Going this far away from Rails conventions makes your code less understandable for future maintainers, and potentially takes on some risk of the gem not being supported in future rails versions.  I'm not sure it's worth it for benefit here that's not entirely to me. (I _would_ like to see an easy way to not transfer state to views with ivars, but keeping the rest of rails controllers largely intact). 

I'm not sure I buy that separate action methods in one class violates the 'single responsibility principle'.  It seems like you could use this same argument to argue that ANY class with more than one method violates the single responsibilty principle -- different methods always do entirely different things. Should every class have only one method? There actually might be real legit arguments for that! But it'd just be a pain to develop. ","1335830738"

"California","t5_2qhsz","Are you referencing this case?

&gt;March 1998. The U.S. Supreme Court today refused to hear a challenge to California's term limits law. The law, passed by California voters in 1990, limits state Assembly members to three two-year terms and state senators to two four-year terms, and bars lawmakers who reach the limit from ever running again.
Without commenting, the court refused to hear arguments by state legislators and citizens who claimed that the law violates the rights of California voters to support their chosen candidates. The appeal also argued that voters were not aware when they voted in favor of the measure that they were approving a lifetime ban.
California's term limits law has had a complicated run through the courts. It was first challenged in federal court in April 1997, when a judge ruled its lifetime restrictions unconstitutional. This judgment was affirmed by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court in Oct. 1997, but for a different reason. The panel said that the initiative approved in 1990 was unconstitutional because it did not clearly stipulate that it would impose a lifetime ban. Both decisions were reversed by the full 9th Circuit court in Dec. 1997, which ruled that the lifetime limits were ""not severe,"" and that California voters knew and fully understood what they were voting on. 
In refusing to hear this case, the Supreme Court has not ruled on the merits of California's term limits law, and the ruling sets no national precedent. At the same time, it is a victory for term limits supporters.","1335830749"

Or rather, how postmodernism is said to follow modernism, but is also a critique of modernism insofar as it challenges a lot of the 'big' ideas that Modernism was after (""Art"" as an ideal, and all that jazz), while still holding out hope in the search for meaning (usually in terms of small local truths, or individual truths). It's particularly true given the extent to which there is still a degree of residual modernism in literary fiction--a lot of middle-of-the-road literary fiction, even well beyond modernism's heyday, still dwells quite a bit in the aesthetic and thematic ideas central to modernism.

A lot of the hardcore gangster image that many artists project is really just an act. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, etc. many are married with families and the furthest thing from their mind would be losing all of that for killing someone. ""Studio Gangster"" is a good term for a lot of these guys. A far cry from all the bitches they claim to bang and people they supposedly kill in their songs. Despite how controversial or famous they are I think that they still deserve a decent amount of privacy, especially their children.

Side story: I did security for Snoop Dogg a couple of years ago and he was a super nice guy. His only instructions were that everyone except for children had to be turned away because he only signs autographs for kids.

0) with many ADHDers constantly complaining about motivation, is it safe to presume that there is a good chance of midbrain irregularities, and they should be considered a part of the core ADHD problem? Focus cannot be effectively deployed without motivation. There are some parellels with apathy/aboulia: http://en.wikipedia.or/wiki/Aboulia#Damage_to_the_basal_ganglia

Motivation and vigor always seem be thought of as psychological phenomena, but it is clear that tonic dopamine has a role, at least in part, and can be addressed chemically. The question is how to maintain it/or some other ways to manage it?

I am not aware of any sustainable ways, do you have suggestions? Is there any current research?  I'd like to see some info on Abilify and ADHD/motviation. (there are some real flimsy experimental results that suggest SSRIs sensitize the mesolimbic pathway's D2 receptors, which they claim is the ultimate final antidepressant pathway. as well some purely anecdotal info on NMDA antagonists retarding tolerance to stimulant's motivational effects (as well as other habit forming substances), but seems to be helpful only with amphetamines, and not NDRIs). 

1) selective frontal lobe dopamine agonist? I am not aware of anything THAT precisely targeted, can you be more specific? 

2) why would tolerance be conveniently ignored? for what reasons? 

3) there are other studies, that show MPH (maybe it was other stims, do not recall now) were no better than placebo after several months. several studies with similar results, that does not sound comforting.

4) I don't have access to literature on SCT, besides whats available in google/pubmed search. to my knowledge, Barkley is the originator of the term, and did the original research. other authors: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11411783

No it doesn't.

If Stannis had Tywin assassinated that way, the Lannister army wouldn't immediately bow down to him, Tyrion would just step in command of it, and if Tyrion died too people would be spooked but there'd still be a Lannister army under Kevan Lannister or someone else etc. The ability to magically automatically kill any one person sounds awesome but doesn't *normally* have that much effect on the course of a war.","1335830770"

Simple enough. So when I come home, my parents of course talk to me (my mom eventually just starts spewing some shit in   my face). At first they were calm. My dad said absolutely nothing the entire time. He sat on the couch like a bag of rocks. But my MOM. Holy cow. She told me what I knew was coming, that ""I'm too young to know what I want"", ""I haven't had enough experience"", ""I'm going to have to live with that unwanted label"" (like I give a shit of my labels), &amp; ""I'm making a stupid decision - this is just a phase."" Yup. The conversation inclined to a yelling match, though I tended to keep my cool. It was just when my mom was talking about *responsibilities* that I lost it. What she was saying was so irrelevant! We hardly talked about my sexual orientation! Instead of that, she told me I needed a job over the summer. I don't even know where that came from, but that's mostly what she felt like she had to talk about. I feel like bringing home my girlfriend &amp; pretty much eat her face in front of them.

If you live in Israel, you pay taxes, and you likely served 4 years in the military. These are the cogs in the machine of genocide, wittingly or not, it doesn't matter. I don't know where your head is, but the genocide of an innocent people requires extremism, especially when the perpetrator DOESN'T LISTEN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

The analogy about the military went right over your head, so I'll put it in laymen's terms for you. While soldiers go through the grueling process of training, they are taught to develop group cohesiveness and function as a single unit. During this process if any one member deviates, the entire group is punished: they may be made to do push-up's, etc. If any particular member develops a habit of deviating and making the rest of the group suffer, the group will begin to resent him for it, and the full weight and frustrations of that group will come down on that member. Said member usually feels horrible for the fact that his actions effect the entire group.

As a mater of fact, most people respond better to this type of group dynamic. They simply don't want to be the one to make their group suffer, AND THEY CAN'T STAND THE FULL WEIGHT, PRESSURE AND PERSUASION OF THE GROUP.

And while there's a difference between Jews and their extremist counterparts, the Zionists, the same group dynamic could certainly apply. 

Like I said, basic group psychology. The end justifies the means. Or perhaps you would allow the genocide and land thieving to continue?

Think of all the good triple a titles you've played. Chances are they felt ""just right"" to everybody out the box. That is how it should be. The impression a game makes is instant. You shouldn't have to tinker to get a good one. In todays climate even setting the resolution and graphic techniques is probably leaving too much up to the gamer for it to call your QA process successful. 

Don't get me wrong its frustrating to find some games, console ports used to be real guilty of this, to find no way to adjust how a game feels. But having to adjust anything is a failure on design. 

If 4/5ths of people dont feel it necessary to adjust settings Id say we are learning how to make pallatable and ergonomic game interfaces and that despite having thousands of hardware options we can distill all the differences down to automated processes.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You need to have a long sit down talk. Try to avoid saying ""we need to talk."" 

First you need to determine if he has slept with anyone, and if he has, you need to get tested, especially if you guys don't use protection. If he already has then you should probably break up with him immediately. Seriously, take it from an ex-cheater who used (and possibly still does) treat girls like shit. Dump his ass he doesn't deserve you and if he has cheated he needs to grow up before he gets in another relationship.

Secondly, if he has not cheated, you need to ask him why he is trying to do this and why he thought it would be okay. Why he thought he could lie to you, a person who should be very special in his life.

Then you need to figure out if this is a fluke or a moment of weakness, or a planned out coordinated attempt to cheat on you without you knowing. You can use your judgement from there but be extremely careful. Also remember you're young and in the absolute prime time of your life, so really there couldn't be a better time for a lifechange like this.

It's hard for people, especially younger people, to be in longterm committed relationships when they have not had a good chance to explore sexually. As someone who has cheated this was my reasoning. I just had to realize that it was selfish to be in a relationship when actually all I wanted was multiple sexual partners. If he's anything like me, he needs to stop lying to himself and say ""I can't commit and I shouldn't trick myself or others into thinking I can."" I don't know the guy so I'm guessing. Maybe he had a moment of weakness and was curious and this can be cleared up with a long and detailed talk. Maybe not.

Sometimes conversations like this can save relationships, sometimes they don't. The most important thing is that he tells you what he is feeling, good or bad, and you tell him to. If you can't do that for each other, it's not going to work out.

Good luck and remember, even if it ends badly, you are awesome and have a lot ahead of you.","1335830782"

You can't blame users for this sort of thing; There's a considerable expectation of privacy when you're using your home network, that even if wardrivers connect to the network, they will be courteous enough not to sniff your wireless traffic. Additionally, Joe User can't be reasonably sure that his wifi is _supposed_ to be secured. Many old routers didn't come with the most trivial security set up, and wifi setup processes appear to be an afterthought in more recent WAPs.

Google should probably have been fined more than $25000 from this sort of thing; it's a flabbergastingly small sum.

IMO ELO Hell doesn't really exist.. You can't really claim that a place where 75% or more of the player base is at is a ""hell."" 

Learning the mechanics of the game as well as always keeping a positive attitude regardless of the situation are the two biggest ways I can think of to get your ELO up. Learn your champions and your lane really, really well and just play, play, play. Tactics and game knowledge don't really matter until you're out of the casual gamer bracket, which is why the transition from ~1200 to ~1500+ is so difficult because then you find yourself learning an entirely new subset of skills.

Yes, you need to move forward ( move on with your life ). He is moving with his.

No, it wont be easier on him (or you) if you two keep talking. He probably realises that it will just pull him into the 'trap' you are setting up.

"gatech","t5_2r8t2","Well you ""don't like"" the kid crying for all sorts of reasons, including empathy. And you want to help him. Why? Probably because you would prefer there to not be little kids crying, you have a better day when it doesn't have crying kids in it, haha. And you also know that you would really appreciate it if you were that kid, and you want to live in a world in which little kids get helped. So you do your part in making it happen.

Do you actually THINK all that? Of course not. People don't explicitly think everything, in word form. What do they do? The feel it, just like you said. You see a kid crying and you feel an urge to help, concern for him, etc. etc. Your feelings encode judgments about the world. So if someone hits you, you get angry, because  you think ""they *shouldn't* have done that!"" And If someone threatens you, you feel scared because you think ""i might be hurt/lose something important to me"", etc. etc.

Every emotion encodes a judgment about some events relationship to your values, to your life. You don't normally consciously think about it, but I'm pretty sure you can look at various emotions and see that you could put the judgment behind them in words if you try. This is the whole basis for cognitive therapy in psychology. You see something, and lightning-fast, faster than you notice normally, your subconscious looks at all your values, all the things you think about the world, and throws out a corresponding emotion.

The emotion is a clue as to what you think right and wrong are, but it doesn't tell you what really is right and wrong. That takes thinking. I really do think ""what is right"" is ""what is beneficial"", and that there really isn't any more to it than that.

And I *do* think people should be ""solely"" selfish, they should think about how to life the most full live they possibly can. Since people are social animals though, that means they also care about other people, oftentimes quite a bit. I definitely think it is even possible to care about someone so much, for someone to be so vital to your life and happiness, that you couldn't imagine being happy without them. And so you could even give up your life for them, and it would still be ""selfish"". I prefer to say ""rational self-interest"", but selfish works too.","1335830788"

Therefore, it is pertinent to arguing against their position to point out where the Bible has wrong values, even if it was something that was agreed upon in the past; in fact *because* it was something agreed upon in the past, because that supports the idea that the Bible was made by mankind and not some *timeless* infallible being.

&gt;calling slavery the easiest moral problem humanity has ever faced is an insult to the innumerable many who have died fighting for freedom

This misses the point of calling it the ""easiest moral problem."" Obviously it's not the easiest to actually get rid of. It's the easiest in terms of how obviously wrong it it, how much it goes against a person's human rights. In other words, if an infallible being was sitting down to write a book on what mankind should and shouldn't do, slavery should near the top of the list of what people shouldn't do, because it's obviously that unequivocally bad. Yet in the Bible, the infallible being condones slavery. Even Christians nowadays agree, without reservation, that slavery is bad, and that the condoning of slavery was a value of the past, and yet  they completely ignore any inconsistency between holding that modern view of slavery and the view of slavery exposed in the Bible.","1335830792"

Deficit spending accumulates debt and the difference between tax recepts and spending is provided by the *expected future economic productivity* of the country.

The problem with this is the debt is passed on to future generations, *enslaving* them to preexisting debt which they *must* pay off.

Plenty of people will write him off right then and there if he's anything below GM, and even then every loss, every mistake, every mis-micro, every rank he drops is just fodder for his ""haters"".

"ECE","t5_2r2sg","1. Your transformer is probably too high an output voltage for your 7805. 30v AC into a bridge rectifier will give you about 42v DC peak (which will ripple when loaded, see 2 below.) Since you seem to have a center-tapped transformer, you could use only one half of it to get 21vDC peak. Even better, find another transformer. You probably only need ~9V ac, and the less voltage you have going into the 7805, the less power it has to dissipate

2. The reason the cap before the regulator is increasing your voltage is best explained here http://www.falstad.com/circuit/e-fullrectf.html. You can adjust the values of the simulator to see what's going on. If you have access to an oscilloscope, it would help you see what's going on in your circuit. Long story short, without the capacitor, the voltage will drop to 0 on every cycle of AC.

3. The reason the filter cap after the regulator is increasing your output voltage is similar to 2.

4. Where are you measuring on your divider? You really should have a correct(ish) output voltage.

5. It'd take about 14 volts to burn out an 1/8W 1.5k resistor. I'm suspicious.

6. I'm curious what you're trying to do with your voltage divider. If you're trying to power something, that's a bad idea. Whatever you're trying to power will be in parallel with the lower leg of the divider, which will swamp the divider and you'll get a very low output voltage indeed. Consider getting a dedicated 3.3v regulator or an adjustable regulator like the LM317.","1335830811"

During that, we couldn't think of why God would send a person doing good things to hell.  With that, we came to the conclusion that a man of any faith that helps others and acts with kindness and compassion will always find peace in the afterlife, whether Jew, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Athiest, or other.

Other Christians may not agree with us, but this is the thoughts of some modern Christians and their sects.  And even if you don't believe in religion, acting with kindness and doing good is the right way to live and I hope that you are rewarded for doing so.","1335830818"

"math","t5_2qh0n","Heuristically, if you understand divergent series a little, since by the prime number theorem the nth prime `[; p_n \approx n\log{n} ;]` then you would expect

`[; \sum \frac{1}{p_n} \approx \sum \frac{1}{n \log{n}} ;]`

The fact that the second sum diverges can be seen from cauchy's condensation test


`[;  \sum \frac{1}{n \log{n}} ;]` converges iff `[; \sum \frac{ 2 ^n}{2 ^n \log{2 ^n}} ;] ` converges and the latter is clearly a multiple of the harmonic series.

Obviously this isn't a proof, actual proofs can be found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_of_the_sum_of_the_reciprocals_of_the_primes (The one of Erdos is very nice)

"business","t5_2qgzg","I did some research:  
- The iron asteroid that caused the meteor crater was 50m across and was travelind at 12.8km/s  
- About half of the impactor above disintegrated on entry  
- The Shuttle's re-entry speed was a maximum of 8.2km/s  

Based on the above, and after a lot of assumptions, my conclusion is that it is unlikely to develop something practical that can slow down an asteroid to a speed that will not cause it to disintegrate on re-entry (and therefore render it useless).

I'd spend WAY MORE than $10 per month keeping their music desires satiated if I were to buy all of the CDs or MP3s, for music that they'll never listen to two years from now.

First you're complaining about the weather and the Bay has probably some of the most mild weather in the country. Does it snow ever? No. Does it get above 100 ever? No.

I rarely use my car, commute on bicycle/BART.  But I have driven and the traffic is pretty bad.

 I also appreciate the complete diversity of people that I have met, a huge change from a homogeneous suburb.  I appreciate be able to be active outside almost everyday of the year.  I enjoy having 1000s of amazing restaurants to eat from when I get to go out.  I appreciate being within range of so much extreme climate diversity, from the ocean to Ski Mountains to Wine country all within a daytrip.

"books","t5_2qh4i","I'm at the beginning of the 3rd book now... I know I'm late to the game, but I didn't see a clear answer. 

In the beginning of the 1st book, there is far more bondage and such than the rest. A couple are pretty brutal (coming from someone who has no BDSM experience, I'm just drawing from what I know.)  However, I would classify most as light bondage. Some tying, some cuffs, and toys with the male in the more dominant lead in sex. There is a sex scene in almost every chapter, if not more than 1. Book 2 has as much sex that kinda starts out plainer and grows to be more ""kinky."" Some mild bondage, but mostly with the male lead growing more ""commanding"" than dominating. If that makes sense.  I can't tell you much about the 3rd book, as I have just started. 

Though, just to let you know, more sex doesn't mean she's into the bondage or that she's not... A lot of the ""inspirations"" I have received from it are more about my own insecurities and how I relate to the female lead who has similar confidence issues. Also some of the sex scenes, but don't think those are necessarily the only reason she is horny. 


SPOILERS:


seriously, there are some spoilers here.... 





It ends up being that the main male lead was abused and traumatized as a child and he's just kinda fucked up. The overall plot is about the 2 characters coming together and finding a way for the relationship to work. So there is some substance, not just all sex all the time. ","1335830843"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","speaking as a die-hard fan of The Thing (1982), probably seen it 100+ times, contemplating a tattoo myself, it's a really unfair comparison because you're comparing a decent movie to a masterpiece. it just makes it look horrible by comparison. I saw it in theaters several times, and every time I saw it I enjoyed it more, because I was able to take it for its own movie instead of comparing to Carpenter's.

everything that is IN the movie is great. it's just too short. my personal opinion is that if the character of Colin hadn't been cut to shreds on the editing floor, it could have been a great film, 9/10 or whatever. not only because he was a great character, but his scenes gave a lot more development to the other characters, particularly Karl, who almost felt like an extra in the final film. not to mention Colin's infamous deleted scene, which is thankfully on the home release.

my recommendation is that if you like shape-shifting aliens, flamethrowers, paranoia, and beards, you can't go wrong with this film. it's an absolute blast, and one scene in particular is probably the most horrifying I've ever seen on screen. but ultra-high expectations set by Carpenter's film will ruin that. really it's down to you and your standards.","1335830850"

Now, most people's first post is nothing spectacular, and his was no different. In fact, someone, somewhere, down voted it. But something was wrong. It was more than the simple down vote you may often see being dished out to those less fortunate of us. You see, this was a down vote that had been the creation of a small nuclear reaction 32 years ago. It was radioactive. Some say that trapped instantly knew something was wrong, that this post he had made was different from the thousands created every day, while others say he remained clueless of what had happened. One way or another, however, something in his accounts coding was changed, changed in a way that, though desperately sought after, has never been repeated. In the month and a bit since then, something about his comments have been different. People up voted them almost unconsciously.

1. In India religious people don’t usually go about putting down atheism. Try to extend the same courtesy.  You may extol your beliefs but please leave the insults out of it. 

2. You have no right to comment on something you don’t fully understand.

3. Government should not have anything to do with helmets and seat belts as it is a personal choice as I’m not endangering other people by not complying.  Of course it can be put in law if person is not complying and dies in accident it is his own fault. But enforcement of such foolish laws when simple lane rules cannot be enforced are just ways of making bribery channels for traffic police. 

4. Sikh men wear the turban as a symbol of following a proud faith. A uniform if u may of a faith renowned the world over for being fierce and just warrior race. A monotheistic religion with no superstitious dogma or cartoon character gods. It is based on the tenets of love and understanding. 

5. unfortunately not all are rich to afford car travel. So it is imperative that accommodations be made in these frivolous laws so that they can continue to follow their ancestral bequest. 

6. People mentioning that they don’t follow Sikhism or are just doing it out of fear of society. Please stop fooling yourself and others around you. You are doing it for the money of your parents. Be a man and do the needful.  Stop being a little bitch.  

That’s it.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","While I agree with where you're going here, I think there are important reasons to raise logical fallacy objections to an argument. How this is best done isn't by calling them out by name, as unanun has done here. It's rather explaining specifically what is wrong (meaning unpersuasive) about using a particular fallacy.

In the case of the ad hominem, this can be done like this: ""Unfortunately, your critique here focuses primarily on the negative characteristics of the argument's speaker, which provides little reason to discount the argument itself. I am curious what other problems you have with the actual argument the speaker is making, and I am less interested in your opinions of the speaker as an individual.""

Approached this way, calling attention to a fallacy helps advance the conversation and establishes for the fallacy's user why their ad hominem argument is unconvincing. It helps the fallacy's user *improve* their argument so it makes more sense to more people.

Additionally, it ensures that the person calling attention to the fallacy actually understands it. Had unanun targeted his examination of the fallacy's deployment this way, he would have noticed there was little wrong with it, as the main problem with the ad hominem is that it alone will do nothing to take apart an argument, only its speaker.","1335830861"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;This is my point. Al Qaeda seems nothing more than a catch-all for a multitude of parties all with their own names and agendas with a common thread of islamic interpretations,

Well it's certainly true any idiot can decide to set his pants on fire in the name of al-Qaeda and the media will eat it up, it's not true that al-Qaeda was a catch all with multiple agendas.  All the intelligence shows it had a very real set of goals and ideals, as crazy as they were, that distinguished themselves from most militants, and they were almost uniquely manned, recruited by the EIJ.

&gt;his death (if it actually happened as there is no evidence)

Oh, I'd bet the entire farm he's dead.  All he'd have to do would be to appear in a video with the day's newspaper and it'd be a scandal that would bring down governments.  Nobody is taking that risk for a 20 cent bullet, or just allowing the elusive nature of his liberty to continue - it'd already been the best part of a decade. When they announced OBL was dead, he was dead.

&gt;I see why EIJ became so radical: In 1994...

It was building up long before that and dates back to at least Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Whatever Clinton said doesn't make him complicit, apolitical with regards to Egypt's domestic affairs and Machiavellian, certainly,  but not complicit.  Pragmatism has to play a part.  ","1335830868"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","&gt; Is it that the reapers are not so sure of their victory that they come up with these choices as a way out? 

Pretty much answered your own question there. If we're applying the IT, at this point, the Reaper's *are* unsure of their victory. No one has ever come this close. The united fleets of the entire galaxy are reigning down upon them. This is very much 'it' for them too. Shepard is literally metres away from victory. In a last ditch attempt to kill him, Harbinger fires his beam, missing, but still throwing him into nearby rubble. It would also be safe to say that after this, it is probably impossible for the Reapers to pinpoint his location, and go after and kill him. Yes, they could just nuke the whole place, but that is not the Reaper way. It seems 'conventional' to us, but they are here to harvest us, not kill us. Depending on what 'nuke' we're talking about here, thousands of lives, lives they need to harvest, would be lost. Or maybe they do find Shepard more valuable alive than dead. Who knows? But I think you could definitely explain it away. Or at least better than the ending is explained. This is their way out. Their last chance to stop Shepard. Bullets don't work, why not mind control?

&gt; If that is the case shepard can pretty much ignore the choices and destroy the reapers as s/he had initially set out to do.

Yeah, pretty much, which is why, in this case, destroy is the right, and canonical, option.","1335830870"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Well..Here is my take on it, a  little arm chair analysis... generally speaking there are huge differences between democrat and republican voters. Regarding corporatism.. dem voters will more often then their gop counter parts, get their news from more than one source, so its a bit harder to suppress the bad news about their politicians than it is for the gop where over 70 percent of them claim fox news is their only source and the only one that can be trusted.  Secondly, dems on average are not obsessed with religious issues or ""social"" issues like gay marriage like the gop. Why the gop is more dangerous is because their voters are COMPLETELY distracted by these ""social"" issues which allow their politicians to do basically whatever the fuck else they want to do, usually involves selling them out to the wealthy/corporations. Republicans will actively and willingly and happily vote against their own best interests based on their hatred of the gays or their holier than thou pro-life stance. And fox news will never tell them the vast majority of the bs their politicians are up to. So even if both sides were equally as corrupt (which I don't think anyone can really make a case for), the gop would be far more dangerous because their voters never, ever, ever, hold their politicians accountable, the majority of them just care to hear their religious views mentioned by those in power, that is it. Again, I repeat, over 70 percent of the GOP watches ONLY fox news. This is alarming to me... And whats odd is when they do hold their politicians accountable, they go ahead and put the likes of the tea-tards into office, even crazier people then before. 

I don't know, I just see no use at this point in even trying to pretend there are any equalities between the two parties. With the way the gop has behaved the past 4 years (and even going 8 years prior to that when they had power), I find it hard to respect anyone voting republican, I see nothing of value in their platform, and recently they are just a bunch of babies crying "" We didn't win so we will make sure nothing gets done so everything remains as shitty as we left it"". 

Please feel free to comment, I am sure you and others will object and want to claim its not that bad or the dems do the same, I am open to having a discussion about this, but not one with out facts, just claiming something isn't an argument (I know I did some of that too here, I was just thinking outloud though, I will back up whatever I said if need be).","1335830885"

"cigars","t5_2r090","A piece of legislation was passed in 2009 called the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act that gave the FDA sweeping regulatory power over all tobacco products.

http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/NewsEvents/ucm173174.htm

To date, the FDA has not asserted that premium cigars are subject to the FSPTCA.  Congress is basically requesting that the FDA assert their authority by releasing a regulation stating that cigars are subject to the law.  At that point, there are a number of areas of concern to some people that are likely to be addressed... the number one of which is mail order/""non face-to-face"" sales, as some folks think this is a loophole that minors use to get cigars.  This is where you will see all the online sites going crazy, and they'll say there are a lot of other things that the FDA could do, like prevent walk in humidors, which is somewhat true but much less likely.  All to get you to call your Congressman.  That's pretty much the gist of it.

It's bigger, being a full tower instead of a mid tower (this was a big deal for me seeing as my current mid tower feels cramped with 2 GTX 480's and a large CPU heatsink), and it also has grommets for cable management (which I feel adds a much cleaner look to the case than standard holes do).

"politics","t5_2cneq","Spot on good sir.  There are many factors involved here and it is hard to sum it all up in a couple sentences.  Here are some of the things that play into both sides.  Negative: Public health an well being, will people be too baked to get off the couch and get a job, will it all be taxed or will renegade underground growers stay off the grid causing illegal weed anyways in a world of legality.  It gets all convoluted with laws and complications.  Do the people even want marijuana to get taken by big tobacco and ridden with addictive chemicals and pesticides.  I personally don't want the herb to take the same route as tobacco.  On the positive side, many reasons exist for legalization: cops wasting time and money that could be used for serious crimes.  People being locked up/arrested and the experience is more detrimental than the dam drugs themselves.  It would also be harder for kids to get a hold of because store owners would refuse to sell it to minors since they have something to lose.  Theres millions more things playing into this so it is important to see all the sides.  Honestly, watch The Union.  This documentary is about weed but it is SO informative!","1335830890"

Also taking that long of time off means someone else is going to do your job and if they do it better than you, you are royally fucked.  They will let you return to your job because that is the law, but the next time they start moving people around, you may be demoted or fired since they just like the other person better.

* Learn to read sheet music. It helps with the music theory part, and people generally want to hire a session guitarist who can read actual notation, not just tabs.
* Play as many gigs as you can. doesn't matter how good you or your backing musicians are, just gig; the worst anyone can do is boo you off the stage.
* Make sure you're listening to a lot of music, and not just guitar-based music either. Listen to music throughout history, and music from around the world.
* Live life. Say yes to new experiences, it opens up new ideas for guitar.
* Keep your options open. You might realize you like playing bass over guitar, prefer writing songs to soloing over chord changes, or being the manager instead of someone in the band. You may even decide you just like guitar for a hobby and find some other job that pays actual money. You don't have to necessarily label yourself as a ""guitarist"" at this point, or any other point for that matter.
* The music industry is fucking vicious. More vicious than you can imagine. People are out to profit from your hard work, and poverty is almost certain for starters. Before you get into this for a career, make sure this is something you HAVE to do.","1335830896"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","My personal favorite way of looking at the duties of the defense attorney is this: it's their job to make sure the defendant's rights are respected, nothing more and nothing less. 

The defendant should not be punished for a crime they didn't commit, but it's not a defense attorneys' job to deny their client did what they did. In practice, of course, there are many defense attorneys who will try to get a guilty man declared innocent, just as there are many prosecutors who try to convict innocent men.

Also, remember that the terms ""guilt"" and ""innocence"" take on very specific meanings in court. For example: A man kills his wife, he's caught and is charged with 1st degree murder. However, he is actually guilty of 2nd degree murder, not having planned to kill his wife. To convict him of the charge would be unjust, as he's innocent of it. Some people would say that justice is better served by an overly-zealous charge, but that's not the philosophical position of the US justice system.

Some people in the comments are saying they'd expect their lawyer to accept nothing less than an innocent verdict, regardless of their actual guilt. Besides being impractical, this is widely unethical (as are criminal acts [generally, not looking for a marijuana legalization discussion :D]). A often-repeated maxim is that a just system is the system you would choose if you had no idea which position you would occupy in that system.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; I also don't get how people messing with religious items on your desk is the same as people spreading the idea with all seriousness that you're an immoral, hateful criminal, and that it's just a matter of time before you rape or kill someone.

My point was that neither are that serious. That's not to say that atheists are without their problems, it's just that I don't think these people are in danger of their lives, otherwise this wouldn't be an annual thing

Now, if people *really* are threatening your life and infringing on your basic rights, then is Smut for Smut really the best way to approach that? Trust me, even though we don't carry the same philosophy I would not sit idly by while someone stripped you of your entitled freedom in America. My point is that if this is a serious issue (far more serious than I perceive), then the bar needs to be raised a hell of a lot higher than ""LOL THE BIBLE IS SMUT!!!"". Since this is what these people have come up with, you'll have to forgive me for being skeptical of their plight. Now, if it's all a shock tactic (which I highly suspect it is) then that's fine. Like I said, they have the freedom to do that, no matter how obnoxious it is. However...

&gt;Too often are we as the minority overshadowed and undermined by the religious majority. Too often are we subjected to just listen to what the religious try to tell us is right without having a word to say back. Too often are we judged as immoral people because we don’t have faith in some God.

This sickens me. If you're really the victim of this persecution and answer with frat boy tactics, I'm not convinced. Either they're taking a serious cause and making a mockery of it or their plight isn't as bad as they want me to believe.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","&gt; They learned how to kill it, killed the incredibly powerful king, accidentally freeing the Tarrasque, then, in a particularly anticlimactic finale, simply bag of holding and portable hole'd it to death after weakening it enough.

That tactic seems like a bad idea. Using a void bomb (portable hole into a Bag of Holding or vice versa) opens a hole that leads to the Astral Plane...and I imagine it will proceed to royally piss off the githyanki and other such creatures residing there that are probably going to make a point of either coming after you or sending the Tarrasque back.

I seem to recall the actual ""rule""-based slaying of the Tarrasque has something to do with dealing hellish amounts of nonlethal damage and then using Wish/Miracle to keep it dead. Though I like the interpretation of not ""keep it dead"" and more ""keep it down"". Of course, that's if you can afford it.","1335830904"

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","Some design details BTW

all of these .gifs show recoil operated pistols with tilting barrels. My first pic and OP's pic show single action hammer fired pistols. They also lock the barrel with locking lugs.

Brohanstalin's pic shows a double action hammer fired pistol, that locks via a breech block or locking block.

My second pic shows a single action striker fired action, that also locks via a breech block.

Some pistols are straight blowback operated, meaning the breech doesn't lock shut at all, and the slide is pushed back by the combustion pressure pushing back on the cartridge. Some locked breech pistols also unlock by rotating the barrel rather than tilting it.

autoloading rifles generally operate by tapping combustion gas from the barrel, and using it to move the bolt carrier, either with a piston or by impinging on it directly. The motion of the bolt carrier unlocks the bolt, usually by rotating it (but less commonly by tilting it) and retracts the bolt to eject the spent cartridge.","1335830909"

To assume that some people are incapable of grasping involved scientific principles creates the exact same kind of Us vs. Them environment that (I hope) we're trying to avoid. 

While I do agree that the scientific community is more trustworthy, thanks in large part to peer review, blind acceptance of keyword blurbs about scientific findings does little to help our society.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had first told my boyfriend I loved him 6 months into our relationship but every time I think about how much I love him a different memory comes to mind.

It was a year into our relationship and his parents had gone out of town for two weeks. Of course, our plan the first weekend they were gone was to have a romantic weekend. At the time we had a sex list consisting of where we wanted to have sex throughout our relationship, one point on the list was drunk sex. So that friday night I went over after school and we had alcohol and dinner and put on a movie. All though prior to this I was beginning to feel a bit under the weather, I just ignore it though. As the night continued I couldn't seem to finish my drink and ended up getting a fever.

It was the beginning of a long weekend. That first friday night i was going between 100+ fevers and getting the chills. It was terrible. I tried sleeping early and couldn't stay asleep for longer than an hour. My boyfriend is a night owl and stays up pretty late and that entire friday night he kept bringing me water, taking my temperature, and brought me ice packs to cool me down and such. I spent the entire weekend there until Sunday afternoon. He had even sacrificed a Saturday BBQ with some of his friends to take care of me also.

He is the sweetest person I have ever met. That weekend was when I know I truly fell in love with him.

If they were more aware they wouldn't have been defeated so easily. If you watched the Legend of Aang you should be aware that there are quick moves and there are longer moves. See how [Toph moves large chunks of earth in a second's notice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ko7VusR04). At one point she uses the earth to boost herself upwards to block arrows from below. If that's not fast bending of large chunks of an element, then nothing is. Toph has moves that take a few seconds to execute but that when she's lifting something massive.

[Look how quick Aang and Azula return strikes](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/291/1/4/azula_vs_aang_by_zuko_zuko_me-d3112av.gif) after the first attack. [Remember these guys too?](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/188/b/6/dai_li_by_arianoula-d3l9mrt.gif) 

The benders just have to be smarter and use their elements in better ways.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","To expand on my point:

I am a little biased because I'm essentially a support main (I say essentially because I only play normals but usually with 3-4 friends and support is my thing) and I almost exclusively run kill-lane supports with the exception of Sona or Lulu because we have certain comps for them. I mostly play Leona, Alistar, Nautilus or Blitzcrank.

Now with that out of the way, I usually start fuming when I see a Soraka. Why? Soraka promotes everything that makes the game boring. As a support, her sole purpose in the game is **mitigation**. She reduces damage, she prevents damage and she reverses the effects of damage. Everything about her skillset is to revert things from happening or prevent them.

I often get the response ""You probably think she takes no skill to play because she has no skillshots"" and that really isn't the problem. It's that I, playing Leona have to actively engage things. I have to position myself linearly and always be aware of my distance relative to the enemy AD and support so that I can know when it's best to engage. As Alistar, I must know where to head butt most effectively, the exact AoE diameter of my pulverize as to hit as many people as possible. All these things keep me on my toes as a player can make or break any play. I could screw up my combo with Leona and get bursted down, I could accidentally headbutt a minion with Alistar and miss a crucial player. This is what makes the game exciting for me and, more importantly, for people who watch the game. For spectators, for viewers and for commentators. There is nothing more frustrating for me personally than to pull myself on to the AD carry, stun them with my Q, land my ultimate on them the moment they get one step away, and them still not dying. I wait for the perfect moment for one person to step in the wrong place so that I can initiate a player, and Soraka presses three buttons (maybe four if she silences me) and her AD carry gets off scot-free.

Okay so that was just kill lanes, but even the other ""sustain supports"" bring something else to the game. Taric and Sona tend to lead for somewhat passive lanes but they are still capable of actively participating: Taric with his ult and stun, and Sona with her various means of harass. They certainly aren't as active as kill lanes, but they still are actively involved with the lane. Taric is going to stun you, Sona is going to shoot music at you (she even has to aim something.) 

Soraka is capable of doing these things but she doesn't need to. In competitive play you will see a good Soraka using auto attacks and silences to harass but the problem is that she doesn't need to. All Soraka needs for her lane is to heal whenever anything interesting happens so that there's next to no action to be spoken of. 

**tl;dr laning with a Soraka is like playing your favourite video game with infinite lives and cheat codes**","1335830934"

&gt;Film/Television Project

&gt;Reznor has stated that Year Zero is “part of a bigger picture of a number of things I’m working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn’t exist.""

&gt;In March of 2007, Kerrang! Radio reported that ""Reznor admitted he’s already in talks about a movie version of his upcoming album, a concept piece, with part two scheduled next year."" Reznor has said that he is currently more interested in a television project rather than a film and that he has a producer and has met with writers.""

&gt;On August 14, 2007, he announced that he and his creative team would soon be taking the concept to television networks to try and make some sort of deal: ""We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens."" [5]

&gt;On June 8, 2008, The New York Times reported that ""Mr. Reznor has been working with Lawrence Bender, Quentin Tarantino’s longtime producing partner, to create a cable TV series to tell the entire story. "" [6]

&gt;On April 2, 2009, Reznor announced via a short Twitter post that ""YZ is alive"".

&gt;On September 28, 2010, The LA Times reported that the Year Zero television series detailed in the above NY Times article was going into pre-production, with Daniel Knauf as a writer and Lawrence Bender's team as staff. The miniseries is being handled by BBC America and will be broadcast on HBO. [7]

&gt;On March 10, 2011, Trent confirms on the nin.com board that work on the TV series is still in progress. [8]

&gt;On June 24, 2011, ""Pitchfork Magazine"" had a section of news stating that Jim Uhls, the man who had written the screenplay for Fight Club and the screenplay for the 2008 film Jumper, was chosen to write the script for the series.

&gt;On December 23, 2011 in an interview by ""The Guardian"" Trent is quoted as follows about the 10-part HBO mini-series, which is based on Year Zero: ""I chose not to write it myself because I don't know how to do that. But now I'm thinking I should have. Somebody's got to do it, right? How hard can it be?"" [9]

&gt;On January 11, 2012 a user on Echoingthesound said that Jim Uhls confirmed him via Facebook that he is currently working on the Year Zero TV series (""I've been away from FB for awhile. Now that I see it, I can answer. I am currently working on Year Zero. [...]"" [10]) 

- Also (related to this thread somewhat), there was a Augmented Reality Game for Year Zero as well, [Yearzero.nin.com](http://www.ninwiki.com/Yearzero.nin.com)

&gt;Reznor paid for the ARG himself, trying to keep it a secret from his record company as much as possible[2], stating: ""What you are now starting to experience IS 'year zero'. It's not some kind of gimmick to get you to buy a record - it IS the art form... and we're just getting started. Hope you enjoy the ride."" The game ran from roughly February 12, 2007 to May 2007, beginning when a string of mysterious websites was discovered around the internet related to the album","1335830935"

I know the 501st (Star Wars costuming group, all the stormtroopers and such) gets away with it because they don't sell complete armor; they only sell raw parts. To get a complete costume, you still need to do work on the parts, buy more stuff (mostly off the shelf or from other sellers). However, there was a lawsuit when Andrew Ainsworth (the guy who made the stormtrooper armor for the movies) began selling complete armor, helmets, and other props without a license from Lucas.

Even though I work for a company that is criticized heavily for wielding patents.

Unfortunately, I can't offer any useful advice about what to do other than what PoopCode said - port and find some app store(s) that you can sell it on (whether that's Android, iOS, Windows, etc).  If it's a good idea that you're afraid of a mega corp stealing, then that's equally likely to happen after you've published it/sold it.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","I was making a joke when I said that, but he does pee outside his box.

He pees on the floor, somewhere next to his box (he does not like sand or any other thing on the box). Tried putting little water bowls where he's not supposed to pee, thinking that he won't pee on his water. Turns out he just finds another place to pee on, or pees on top of the water bowls.

If there's no food on his bowl, or if the food is older than a day, he'll pee outside his box. So I have to constantly watch the bowl because he sometimes will eat really fast and there will be no food, or will eat slowly and the food won't taste fresh.

I'm not punishing or teasing him, I never even caught him in the act of pissing outside his box. And he's neutered.

He fears the water bottle, and I only shake it in front of him when he attacks me. One day I was folding clothes over the table, he gets out of his comfy spot on the couch, jumps on a chair and gives me a few nasty scratches. The other day he scratched and bit my leg after I arrived home and he started rubbing himself on my legs. I'm not talking about little nibbling and patting, I'm talking about teeth sunk into my calf and big slashes from his claws. He's not afraid of the broom, he just doesn't being touched by it, so he just moves from where I don't want him, like under my bed or inside my desktop pc.

I tried yelling 'NO' but it only stops him sometimes. And I won't try pinning him down because it might injure him, and he will slash me. He likes raw meat, and I give him some bits when he pees on the right spot, and after I vacuum the house, or just as a treat.

The thing is, his mood swings really fast. And I can't trust him that he will not attack me while I pet him. I'm always suspicious because it has happened some times before.","1335830944"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Copy/pasting my newbie response. Purge's channel and joindota have already been mentioned, but there are some other resources you should be aware of.

There are a bunch of links in the sidebar that should be helpful. This thread in particular should help direct you to everything you'll need/want. http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/qckss/new_players_reddits_compiled_guide_to_dota2/

When you're playing with other people, whether co-op vs bots or against human opponents, never be afraid to ask a question about something you're confused about. There will always be jerks here and there, but I think you'll find that your teammates will generally be extremely grateful that you took the time to ask. I've also been helping a friend who's just started getting into DOTA 2, and put together a playlist of some tutorial videos. You don't have to marathon them all at once, but you might want to just bookmark it or something so you can pull up specific tutorial videos as you get more and more into the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTZxmNx_rDw&amp;list=PL9E2A791DF99B5DD5&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video 

But if you only read one article before jumping into DOTA, this is the one you HAVE to read: http://www.welcometodota2.com/2012/01/purges-inclusive-guide-for-noobs-aka.html  It covers all the basics, ranging from the mechanics of the game to explaining why some heroes benefit from certain lanes more than others. 

Have fun, and I'll leave you with this, taken from the Welcome to Dota 2 guide by Purge I linked: ""The last and best piece of advice I can give you is the reminder that DotA 2 has a huge skill curve. I have been playing for about 3+ years. I have played THOUSANDS of games of dota. Every month that goes by, I think about how good I thought I was at dota a month or two ago, and it amazes me how much I’ve learned since then. Even players with good k/d(kills per death) need to realize that there is room for improvement on their game.""","1335830948"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Alright sure, here are some of my suggestions

-After getting knocked down or stunned, if you had a skill in queue it should reset and no longer be in queue. There's nothing more frustrating than getting knocked down, having someone run away from you, and then wasting the cooldown of one of your abilities on air while you're standing up.

-Incorporate more slow skills to melee classes. I think the amount of gap closers in the game is fine, there just aren't many ways to stick to someone as a melee. Unlike gap closers where someone just ends up in your face, slow skills can still be dodged and you can use your abilities to break the slow if you feel the need to. I think this would be easier to balance around as opposed to adding more gap closers.

-Crafting XP feels too low to me. I chopped down every tree, harvested every herb, and mined every patch of ore I came across but I still felt like I was out-leveling my crafting skills really quickly.

-WvW needs to give more experience, and you really shouldn't have to pay to get your armor repaired from dying.

-The spawn rate on mobs was as a whole too high. I think that needs to be toned some for sure.","1335830950"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I love how you ignored this bit:

&gt; Come on, we both know its based on ethnicity. **An Israeli Arab can get Palestinian citizenship, but a Jew cannot.** Please explain how this is not based on ethnicity.

Please stop going around in circles around the ethnicity issue. What you are advocating is certainly ethnic cleansing.

Its actually really funny if you think about it. This line for example:

&gt; Nothing to do with ethnicity. Everything to do with citizenship (or lack thereof).

I have heard so many times from pro Israelis that advocate Israel's actions against the Palestinians. They claim Israeli actions are not ethnic cleansing since they have ""Nothing to do with ethnicity. Everything to do with citizenship (or lack thereof)."" except in their case it is Israeli citizenship. After all, Israeli Arabs enjoy the same benefits in the settlements as Israeli Jews.

I have to admit that hearing this from someone who defines himself (Am I wrong?) as an anti-Israeli just made my day.

&gt; The Palestinians ethnically cleansed during the Nakba were living where they were living legally. They were not part of illegal settlements contravening the Fourth Geneva Convention.

The fourth Geneva convention was signed in 1949. That was after the Nakba.

The Palestinians you are referring to actively resisted the Partition plan though, which was a violation of international law.

&gt; using war crimes as a negotiating tactic. Disgusting.

You can be disgusted all you want, but that will not solve the conflict. If you want a real solution, you should leave your feelings out of it, and look at the situation in a purely analytical way. Unless the Palestinians agree to what I (and the Israeli government) proposed, they will end up in an even worse situation.

&gt; All the Palestinians who can't live in their main city because it's been annexed by a foreign country. All the Palestinians who don't have enough water because by some coincidence the settlements are sitting on top of the aquifer and the Israelis are taking 80% of the water. All the Palestinians who are living exactly like they are now, except it would supposedly be legal.

Well, as much as they like their main city, they have lost it and they are not going to get it back. Israel also didn't control almost all of Jerusalem until 1967 (including the holiest place in Judaism), and yet it still signed the ceasefire treaties with the Arabs. There is a big chance they will be able to get the eastern neighborhoods as an enclave one day, as long as Israel feels it is not a threat (the peace treaty proved successful). EDIT: It might actually be possible to insert that into the treaty - if the peace holds for 20 years, the eastern neighborhoods go to Palestine as an enclave.

The water will have to be part of the treaty. I can almost guarantee you Israel will agree to pass significant amount of water to the Palestinians, just like with Israel's treaty with Jordan.

The Palestinians will live much better than now, because they will have free movement around the west bank, and no friction with Israel's forces.","1335830952"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Perhaps you can see why this sounds like a circular argument.

There is no doubt that every social institution suffers from perversion of the original purpose to gain control over people, and that vigilance against such is strongly warranted.  

The mystic experience that is celebrated by religious practice celebrates the worth of individuals as they are all religious traditions I have experience with.  There is a tension between the wildness and freedom of the religious experience and the control and restrictions of the institutions that grow out of these experiences.

Differences of all kinds have been used as wedges between people, even those that have no origin in religion such as arbitrary beauty standards.

I prefer a LPer that's humorous but knows enough about the game not to suck or fall into the ""ohh I died! Isn't that funny?"" trap. Also, cursing is a game breaker. A slip-up is fine, but if everytime you die you're like ""mother-loving gosh darn son of a morally irresponsible person!"" I'm turning the video off.

Kinda the reason why I don't buy into people like chugga, HCBailly, or Northernlion. Yes their commentary IS good (what a commentary should be), but they don't keep it lively enough for my tastes.

and of course A/V quality should be at least decent, but if a LPer cares enough that his commentary's good and not ""oh my god!"" reactions every 3 seconds, he probably cares enough for his A/V to be watchable and listenable.","1335830952"

Here is exactly the kind of argument I don't want to get into. You do no see sufficient evidence that God exists so you believe he doesn't? I just come back saying I don't see sufficent evidence that he doesn't exist, therefore I believe he does.

&gt;Belief doesn't deal with reality. Observation does. Observation allows us to see how reality works and weight our belief systems.

Have you observed evidence that God does not exist? I'd love to see it. You do not have an active belief that God does not exist. You simply lack evidence that he does. If you had evidence that he did not exist, then you would believe he does not. But you don't have evidence, therefore you don't have belief. And then you say ""You don't have evidence that God exists so how can you have belief?"" and then we go around in circles.

All I'm saying is that a lack of belief in something is not a denial of its existence, idea or otherwise. You can disagree that something exists, sure, but you cannot believe it doesn't.","1335830959"

"Columbus","t5_2r373","I work at a verizon retailer and have been in the industry for about 6 years, 3 of those years at att corporate.  Not all authorized retailers are sketchy.  plus i find that verizon corporate employees are morons because they dont realize that their company sells ""Carrier-return"" phones which were on an account and brought back within 14 days to their retailers for re-sell...they are pretty much new and still covered under a warranty but when they go to the store a rep will easily tell the customer its used.  

Now i will say that VZW retailers also sell used equipment which is approved as far as VZW's policies are concerned but by law (at least here) you have to be informed or were forced to replace the device for you.  we have all of our customers that are purchasing carrier return phones or used phones sign an agreement stating they were informed.

im sorry that happened to you and i do agree that it would *never happen at a COR location.  Some carriers' authorized retailers do 40% of their business nationwide and most people do not know how to read a sign that clearly states if the stores a COR store or not.

i can tell you from working at att corporate that you can run into some sketchy salespeople anywhere you go...my best advice is to find someone friendly or ask friends of yours who they go see to meet their wireless needs.","1335830960"

"Documentaries","t5_2qhlh","I don't know that the plants are consciously trying to tell people something like what one person does to another when they whisper something in their ear. I feel it's more akin to body language or something else slightly intangible. It's there, the message is there, but it may be impossible to actually describe it or speak about it in real words. 

Also, I do realize body language can be studied and talked about in at least a mostly scientific way so it's hard to compare that and these substances but to the untrained person body language is just a ""signal"" they get. They don't talk about it or most likely even consciously recognize it, but the message is received. 

I disagree with the weapons against animals, at least in this and other cases. DMT, psilocybin, cannabinoids, etc fit into receptors in our brain. We co-evolved with these substances. That's pretty interesting. I don't know the reason behind it, I'd assume it's because our ancestors were using these substances and in the case of DMT there is evidence it's naturally in our bodies.

My question, specific to DMT, is: WHY is it so common to so many life forms and why does it create the reaction it does? If it truly is in our body, and turns out to really be released at birth, death, and near death I think it partially answers, but more importantly brings up even more questions about humans, animals, consciousness, and reality.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","How is it silly logic? It pays less than standard commercial TV space does - that's a fact.

If I no longer have to clear my plate to watch a show on Sunday at 10:00 because I can watch it anytime, why would I choose to watch it on TV anyway? I'd go the more convenient route for me, but less profitable to the network. End result? Network loses by making it available online (for the current money it gets them).

Some day in the future ad space online may be as valuable as ad space on TV - and when that day comes, these issues will cease to be a problem.

[How has this affected you relationship with your parents? Do you have any siblings? What was your experience like living in the group home? Are you at all religious? Do you think it ""helped"" you at all? What did it feel like once you were ""set free?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sytbs/i_was_sent_to_a_christian_group_home_against_my/c4i3ui7?context=5)|When I first returned, I was very upset. I didn't want to talk to them and even since then, there has been some slight resentment towards them for uprooting me from my life and friends without notice. I have one older sibling, who is and has always been the golden child. In short, I can say that my experience was hell. They would tell me I was going to hell for not being a Christian and force me to go to church every Sunday, youth group ever Wednesday, and Bible study every Monday night. We were not allowed into other parts of the house without asking permission (IE not allowed upstairs, out in the yard, other bedrooms, etc.) We were forced to go to bed at a certain time every night and were locked in our rooms and not allowed out, even to use the restroom. Trips to town were only permitted if we were well behaved. The list goes on. I am not at all religious. If anything, the experience has made me resent religion even more. In my case, I don't think it helped at all. I was never doing anything that a normal kid my age wouldn't do. All I did was drink. And when I returned, I continued drinking with my friends. The sense of freedom didn't hit me until the plane landed and I was out of the airport. It was the most overwhelming feeling I've ever had and I felt joy and anger at the same time. 
[There is nothing christian about this place. it makes me so mad when people get money and do things in the name of god that are so obviously wrong. you cannot make anyone believe in god-it's that simple. im really sorry you had to go through this. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sytbs/i_was_sent_to_a_christian_group_home_against_my/c4i6rhk?context=5)|I just blame it on greed and bigotry. Thanks for your consideration.
[You make me feel as if I'm not normal, as I dislike drinking. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/sytbs/i_was_sent_to_a_christian_group_home_against_my/c4i5pmi?context=5)|I'm not saying drinking is normal for a person in high school, but during that time, some teenagers like to experiment and have fun with their friends. I know plenty of people that do not drink and I do not consider them abnormal. I know plenty of people that do drink as well. I don't think that that has anything to do with who a person is or how they are.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay, so a couple years ago I had a similar problem. I found a little trick that works quite nicely. You're going to need: a shovel, a garbage bag, hose, a pump, a tub of brightly coloured paint (water works as well, but it's less exciting), and a glass bottle.

In the middle of the night, dig a hole in their yard. It only needs to be about two feet deep and two feet wide. Put the garbage bag in it, fill the bag with paint, and stick the hose into the bag. Then bury the bag. When you step on the soil, a bit of paint should squirt out of the tip of the hose.

Next, place the hose's other end anywhere you damn well please. Aimed at their door, at their car, hell, even straight up (although they'll notice this after stepping on the bag one time and spraying themselves).

Finally, hide next to their house and wait. As soon as they step on the bag, break the bottle on the side of their house and stab them in the stomach with it.","1335830975"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","My idea is for a Fantasy New World Exploration Rpg with similar gameplay elements as the Star Control games.  You would start at a bustling port colony where the tutorial would be as well as a return point between expeditions.  You would then choose between three character classes based on which organization you joined.  Becoming a Naval Officer, a Royal Marine or joining the Arcane University, and ranking up in each.

The officer branch would have you doing things like navigating by charts, recruiting a crew, upgrading your ship and commanding troops while on expeditions.

The Marine would be the easiest to play and just have you following orders either on expedition or while defending the ship from boarding parties during combat.

The Arcane scholar would be the most difficult to play.  Your main focus would be to discover ancient artifacts or collect flora and fauna from exotic locations while on expeditions.  You would also be the healer for expeditions and provide buffs and debuffs for the marines that accompany you.  The magic system would be tough too, and have you performing quick time like button mashing combos to cast spells, similar to old school fighting games.  The more complicated the spell, the more buttons you will be mashing in combo.  Also you could use artifacts you collect to research improvements for other parts of the game from your ship to weapons.

The bulk of the game would be to discover randomly placed set piece islands, each with its own unique problems and challenges.  The overall campaign would be similar for each character class, but would be viewed from obviously different perspectives.

Thats the base to the game, each island would have its own story, and their would have to be some kind of meta story to tie everything together as well.  Which would have some Pirates of the Caribbean styled humor and myths and legends borrowed from other classic works like the Odyssey and Beowulf. ","1335830994"

Also, in the peace studies field, peace tends to be thought of as a process, rather than an end state- it is something you actively DO, not a passive state.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","Some design details BTW

all of these .gifs show recoil operated pistols with tilting barrels. My first pic and OP's pic show single action hammer fired pistols. They also lock the barrel with locking lugs.

F_stop_cruz's pic shows a double action hammer fired pistol, that locks via a breech block or locking block.

My second pic shows a single action striker fired action, that also locks via a breech block.

Some pistols are straight blowback operated, meaning the breech doesn't lock shut at all, and the slide is pushed back by the combustion pressure pushing back on the cartridge. Some locked breech pistols also unlock by rotating the barrel rather than tilting it.

autoloading rifles generally operate by tapping combustion gas from the barrel, and using it to move the bolt carrier, either with a piston or by impinging on it directly.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Here you simply devolve into unnecessary abuse, all the time while holding that you agree with youngsecularhumanist that retarded people up to a certain extent must be euthanized. Nothing more to be said.

I never said anything about retarded people. In fact I precluded retardation from that category: early deaths and painful lives are not defining traits of retardation. 

&gt;He obviously means retarded people incapable of contributing to society. If they were able to, I'm sure even he would agree that there's absolutely no reason for them to be euthanized.

That's not what he said. He said ***all in all circumstances*** and left no room for wiggle. You're making assumptions. I'm not. I'm the bad person? 

&gt;No matter what you might say, mentally challenged individuals simply cannot have a healthy, functional relationship with another human being.

The entire argument is childish. It's ""I don't think someone is as good as I am, so they should die."" Also, for the record, plenty of people whom are not retarded go through life without having meaningful relationships. We can't use characteristics of life like this as a qualified factor to determine lesser-humans, because people across the spectrum of capability and disability have trouble with it. It's a direct equivalent of choosing the ""better"" people by shoe brand choice.  

&gt;You chose a very wrong thread to read if you were so easily offended, my friend. I believe the OP specifically asked for views one might consider to be politically incorrect. The fact that you won't let a man speak his mind at a forum very much dedicated to such an objective goes a long way in showing us what a good listener you are.

Really? I'm pretty sure the purpose of this thread was to dredge up controversial discussions. I would have glossed of the the entire argument had the poster just said ""Retards should die, they aren't equal."" Instead, poster used an entire supporting structure of reasoning that can be decimated without more than 4 sentences per bullet point. What a very solid argument indeed. If you want to have controversial beliefs, fine. Support them firmly and with sound judgment and reasoning. 

&gt;The kind of person he said such a thing about cannot take care of himself, needs a caregiver around the clock, is a drain on someone's time, resources, peace of mind and in the long term, happiness. He isn't talking about everyone who needs parenting. He definitely does not think children need to be killed, I assure you.

She made a blanket assertion that ***All were like some*** and because all were like some, ***all should die.*** She never at any point asserted that only some or only these-and-them. She's guilty of painting with a big brush and I don't understand why you're giving her this much benefit of the doubt. 

&gt;Spirituality isn't a quantifiable goal that can be said to have been attained or not attained.

All the more reason for this to not be a bullet point in a list of reasons to kill retarded people across the board....

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","&gt; What a lot of non-camp gay guys fail to understand is that stereotypes come from somewhere.
&gt;
&gt; That somewhere? It's the real world.

I'm sorry, but I have to go ahead and call bullshit.

First off, though there aren't any studies to my knowledge, feminine behavior is probably only loosely related to sexual orientation. I mean, consider all those ""not sure if gay or hipster"" meme images: the plural of anecdote isn't data (and this criticism cuts both ways), but with the plethora of false positives (feminine guys who aren't gay) *and* false negatives (masculine guys who are gay), it is at least a very strong statement to say that femininity is actually related to homosexuality, and certainly one that would require much stronger justification than a passing sentence on a message board.

Second, while the feminine gay man is a *stereotype*, it has as much to do with bizarre historical biases (the traditional view was that receiving anal is a ""feminine"" activity, and under Ancient Roman law, only the bottom committed a crime against nature), stereotypes that emerged from those biases, and once that stereotype was in effect, the fact that there's an obvious sampling bias problem: if you think that feminine guys are gay, then you'll preferentially notice the gay feminine guys. Like, everyone knows Oscar Wilde was gay; many fewer people know Walt Whitman was also gay (and supposedly the two of them had sex). Taking that sampling bias into the modern world and saying that the increased *visibility* of feminine gay men means that femininity is the norm for gay men is another incredible leap of logic.

Finally, it's nearly impossible to control for stereotype feedback, of gay men *acting* (or *internalizing*) femininity that may not have developed otherwise (i.e., if they were raised in a different culture) either because that's how they think they're supposed to act, or because they want to indicate to other gay men that they're gay.

Now it's possible that I'm wrong, and in fact femininity is the norm for gay men, and I'm the outlier, but at the very least, that's not the sort of thing you can just assume or claim outright without substantial (i.e., more than anecdotal) justification. Hence there is some reason to question the fact that femininity is treated as normative for gay men, when that's very likely a bit of historical bullshit.","1335831008"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I got downvoted to hell over in /r/sex for posting [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/szol0/men_have_it_fucking_hard_when_it_comes_to_sex/c4iclzb):

&gt; I don't understand the ""Men Have to Work to Hook Up"" part, as though women never have to get over their body issues and appear confident and put themselves out there. In general a man might have to ""work"" in order to get the hottest girl in the bar, who's probably just accustomed to having people come to her, but most women don't spend their night shooing away men. This just perpetuates the idea that the only women who matter are attractive women. Men and women have it just as hard when it comes to meeting someone new and making a move.

You commented that the article was strictly about men, not women, so I can maybe sort of understand why my comment was taken the wrong way. But in your article you say this:

&gt;As a woman, I think we need to help the guys out! Approach a guy and buy him a drink at the bar, or chat him up. Be non-judgmental and open-minded.

Implying that women, including myself, don't already do this or consider doing this. And I'm sorry, but when I approach a guy at a bar, it's not because I'm looking to help him out or make his night better, since he has to put up with so much societal pressure, but because I'm genuinely interested in getting to know him and seeing if there's a spark there. Men do the same. It's completely and understandably selfish. This article made it sound like it's my job as a woman to make the world better for the men around me. Yes, I'm glad that you're bringing attention to the fact that men also face a lot of pressures regarding sex, but you went about it in a very strange way. It's very contradictory. You wanted to talk strictly about men, but YOU brought women into it.

I think we should stop treating each other as ""men"" and ""women"" and making lists of all the ways that society has worked to fuck each of us over and just start treating each other like human beings, period.","1335831016"

 the OP/OC (original content) says that about 4/5 of games aren't optimized. and implies that means 4/5 of gamers don't optimize... two different variables but we will get back to that.

the person this individual is responding to always max settings. contextually from the responce, the guy also always max settings on games he plays but the reason so many aren't optumized is because the games aren't worth playing. (meaning there are far more variables than mentioned)

the point he was trying to make/allege, but mistakenly left in the subtext, is that people always optimize/change settings for the games they enjoy. 

in other words the data allegedly can't reflect the conclusion the OC implies, because the metric is fundamentally invalid. it assumes there are people who optimize the games, and those who don't, when more likely it is a double sample with people altering games they like playing enough that they feel like improving play experience.

i don't agree with this, but if you look into the OC you will see the title of the graph is dissimilar with the variable/group measured. so that might be where the popularity came from.","1335831019"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Just a word to the wise, the bank is fucking with you. All debit transactions are checked against your current balance. It's impossible for the bank to not know the moment you draw on the account. As a low balance member the vast majority of your worth comes from overdraft fees. One overdraft and the bank makes more money on you in that moment then they will for the next 10 yeas if your money just sits there.

You don't want ""Overdraft Protection"" or ""Overdraft Prevention"". You want nothing to do with overdraft. Basically they come up with clever names so they can ""protect you"" from being declined *when you overdraft*. That's when they asses the fee. And they are trained to try to convince you that this is an important protection. It's not, it's a money making scheme.

You need to sit down with a banker and make sure that when you are going overdraft, you are declined. Be adamant. And call back a week later to make sure, often times they'll ""lose the paperwork"" and you'll still be able to overdraft.

Finally, anytime you make a change, like get a new card, they'll restore your ""overdraft protection"".

Without fees, the bank would lose money offering debit cads to low balance members. With fees they make hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And they hit you when your at your most vulnerable: When your broke.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; If you narrow down and refine your argument specifically, then you can use bayes theorem to prove that a simpler claim is automatically more likely than a more complex one, for certain definitions of simpler. (I gave the link before - see wikipedia's article on proofs of occam's razor).

Right, but I don't think the there's an empirical way to get at those probabilities (at least for most situations). Take the reticular theory vs. the neuron doctrine--can you even ask what the probability of the nervous system being continuous vs discretized? I mean it's settled now, but which is the more parsimonious theory according to the razor?

&gt; The common arguments that I've seen are based on:
The predictive power. A simple theory predicts more.
The number of tweakable parameters. A simply theory has fewer places where you could make a small change and have an equally valid theory.
Following these rules, ""God did it"" is not a simple explanation for anything.

Or we could try to explain the existence the resurrection story in the Gospels. We could take the Christian account, that it really happened (or that just the important stuff happened), or we could say that no, Jesus died, the body was removed by an interloper, certain portions were embellished, etc. How would you gauge the predictive power or number of tweakable parameters?

Ockham's razor really only seems useful for reject things involving fairies, leprechauns, and conspiracy theories, i.e. things that one has already decided are absurd. If you're pulling out the razor, you already know what's getting cut.

I could believe that *historically,* simpler claims have more often been right, but that seems more a statement about human beings than the nature of logical propositions.

I mean, as a physicist, you could probably imagine the universe being more parsimonious at the bottom of things. Would you take two (as of yet) untestable hypotheses about idk, quarks and say, ""this one has slightly less words, let's run with it?"" I don't feel Ockham's razor really has any force behind it. It's more of euphemism for ""You're pulling that out of your ass,"" and it may mean someone is *unjustified* in their belief, but I don't think you can say a belief is more likely wrong simply because it's complex.","1335831030"

Its also important to note that the guys we were playing against were the field team, so they had their huge egos on, and thought they were so high and mighty. so after about 5 minutes of waiting, the opposing team, 5 or 6 of them, comes down the valley, across the path from me, they were comming out of some big shrubbery type plants, and i was behind some of my own, I only had maybe a 2 inch spot of sight on them.
   I picked up my gun, popped off one shot through the brush, hit the guy on point dead center of mass. He starts flipping shit, runs over to the ref and started yelling at him for shooting him, and the rest of his squad come through the brush, and i picked the rest of them off the exact same way. the ref just starts busting out laughing and pointed in my general direction, saying it wasnt him. at this point the whole squad is pissed off and goes to respawn.   The best part about it is how that squad always brags about how great they are and how they never lose, and how their Polar stars are so amazing, and single handed i killed them all without them even knowing where it came from.","1335831035"

The other thing is that when you look at when CLG was at it's best it was when he was on an impact role.

"vita","t5_2sjmv","This could have been something great but a few too many issues result in a game that causes more frustration then enjoyment.

* Loading times aren't great but drastically increase once progressed through campaign + downloaded maps - fixed this by starting from scratch and not doing the campaign/downloading many mods.
* Framerate is rarely consistent and often in the low 20s. Bigger dips when some of the level 3 weapons are launched, which do look pretty cool but bring the fps to slideshow levels - making it *even harder* to see what is going on/control the kart properly. 
* No online VS (which was in the PSP version)
* Heavy rubber-banding in AI

Other bugs that annoy you while racing but it has some really fun moments and a lot of effort went into various parts of the game like map creator yet it is the only Vita game I am considering deleting (and I have like 6 other psp games that I am keeping on the memory card ahead of it). Such a shame as it has some otherwise **brilliant** racing/drifting mechanics and weapons - and the unlimited selection of decent maps (even the PS3 ones) is awesome. Not that you'll want to wait through the loading time if you download too many of them though.

Lastly, if you're an entrepreneurial sort of person, I think it's much easier to start your own venture as a computer engineer than aero engineer.

There really aren't any groundbreaking technological advances in aircraft design that would be easy to form a business around unless you look at UAV type stuff, but that's going to be more CE anyway.

I  am a mental health therapist.

One of my schizophrenic clients said he was seeing a girl in his room and he said was talking to him. We believed it to be a hallucination as he was living alone. The doctor I was with decided to challenge his delusion and had him take a picture of her so he could ""meet her"".

During, the next visit...he brought a picture. And yes, she was there. To our astonishment and horror there was a picture of him on the couch with a strange creamy, ghost like image of a girl hovering behind him...shrouding him in white like wings or hair...very light in color, but subtle shimmering image! What was eerie was seeing him sitting on the couch with his head down-very depressed looking. [She was literally haunting him].

All our jaws hit the floor. You could hear a pin drop. Everyone examined the picture...and we could tell it was real. Dude, was very low-functioning and could not of shopped it. Shit got real. WE were haunted.

The doctor in utter amazement knew medication wouldn't treat this and said,

It all just depends on what OP wants really. If he wants a 3 panel gaming system a high quality set of TN panels works great. If cinematic viewing, photoshop, general use, AND gaming are priorities, ips is really a decent choice.

Of course, I personally went with an MVA. I couldn't help it.

My trusty FW900 trinitron finally died a terrible death. Coming from that -outstanding- monitor left me really upset with the way the LCD panels ""looked"". I went a few places staring at panels and suddenly I saw it. The blacks were superb, the colors bright, and I was still walking toward it from an odd angle - clearly it wasn't a TN. One look and I was sold on the tech. I went home to research it a bit - it's considered in between IPS and TN, great viewing angles/colors/crispness with OUTSTANDING black levels (well above IPS in terms of contrast) and perfect for someone who works in photoshop etc on a regular basis (colors are vibrant and spot-on). On a lark I pulled up the local craigslist since it was already well into the evening. On the first freaking page there was the 24"" MVA panel I wanted, 75$ ""has issues, make offer"". I called to find out what the ""issues"" were, he said the text seemed screwy. Turned out his computer was seeing the monitor as a TV screen and pushing 1080P instead of 16:10 1920x1200 (a very simple-to-fix EDID issue thanks to his nvidia video card). I didn't tell him this diagnosis, I just frowned and pulled out some cash with a ""maybe I can fix it"". 50$ and I walked away with it, sat it on my desk at home, plugged it in, and fell in love all over again.

So I guess what I'm saying here is really, OP, you need to spend some time actually -looking- at the monitors before you make a call like this. IPS is great, MVA can be daaaaaamned beautiful, TN can be one hell of a bargain for a -lot- of screen real-estate. Make the call based on what looks best to -your- eyes.

You couldn't really get a meaningful degree in Austrian economics - they don't believe in empirical observation, so throw out statistics, they don't believe in market failures, so throw out any study of public goods, developmental failures... the list goes on.

"politics","t5_2cneq","individual states could do basically the same thing. In fact, when he was governor of MA, Romney actually put in a state wide plan very similar to Obamas.  The problem with that if one state manages to get cheap, affordable care, people, especially sick people, will have an incentive to go there for treatment, and you still have a form of government with power.

To be honest, this is one area where the government should be helping out.  If you think basic healthcare is something everyone should be able to have, and not have it cost outrageous amounts, well, any example of that (i.e. canada, EU states) have a large government presence.

Furthermore, right now, the government doesn't have that much power, but the big drug companies, hospitals, and insurers sure do, and they (unlike even a non-perfect government) are interested in profits, not actually helping people.","1335831052"

The biggest downside is that it can get a little hectic around Fisherman's Wharf, but if you're out early enough you can avoid that.  An alternative would be to head west into the Panhandle and Golden Gate Park. There's plenty of trail throughout the park, and several roads are closed to cars on Sundays.

The cost is probably the biggest drawback.

Final Edit: After looking in to this monitor pretty extensively, I've decided against it solely for the reason that it doesn't have Over Drive. I've seen a lot of positive feedback on the monitor and I'm sure it would be great for general use, but for gaming, I'd be too concerned about ghosting.

- *Babel-17*, by Samuel R. Delany (1966).
- *The Embedding*, by Ian Watson (1973).
- *The Dispossessed*, by Ursula K. Le Guin (1974).
- *Contact*, by Carl Sagan (1985).
- *The Poison Oracle*, by Peter Dickinson (1974).
- *The Languages of Pao*, by Jack Vance (1957).

This is quite a funny article in general, and if you can't access NLLT through JSTOR or similar, it's available in Pullum's fantastic collection of essays from this column called ""The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax and other Irreverant Essays on the Study of Language"" (University of Chicago Press, 1991), which is possibly the most hilarious book written by a linguist.

A friend of mine got interested in this topic and coined the term ling-fi for this genre. He also pointed out China Miéville's *Embassytown* was another case, which apparently involves an alien language where words *are* their referents, so the Saussurean sign doesn't apply here, and lying and deixis is impossible. And everything must be simultaneously articulated with two mouths.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well let's see:

FIRSTLY:
If it's a transient thing in her life, she will enjoy and cherish the experience and grow out of it.  But lets face it some people are addicted to food for fuck's sake, so just because it happens to be meth we don't need to shudder when we hear it - anything can be addictive.  
THE POINT:  If she has an addictive personality, then it will be difficult to have any influence on her.  Addiction is a fine balance between willpower and seduction.  To successfully do drugs once must NEVER be owned by them and must have the willpower to stop at anytime.  The true test to oneself is to get drugs and then throw them out and do something else instead ;)  The psychology of addiction is a personal journey and sure parents, friends can get involved.  But here some insight.  Have you ever read on social media sites that your friend is 4 days free from smoking or whatever, that is quest for external validation.  These individuals seldom quit, because a true liberation from addiction is having the willpower to just stop, for yourself without anyone knowing.  I HOPE your friend is STRONG!  If she is, she will figure it out.  The truth is that a ""normal"" person can have a beer, smoke a joint, have some sex, eat a meal, take a pain killer ... etc and still function if it is all done in moderation.       

WHY I AM QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THIS:
1) I was addicted to meth for a solid 4 months and put my life (university) on hold to party strictly for the experience without social consequence. 2) Everyone thought I was a meth addict, when I quit, I did not tell anyone because I quit for me (this is so important). 3) After being clean for 4 years I befriended a girl that was a hardcore meth addict (10 years) and even though I watched her do line after line I NEVER did, but I never told her anything about it either just that I love the stuff, so I know I can't get involved.  5 years later she wrote me an email thanking me for never judging her and that she quit meth for good, has been clean for 2 years and that my will power was an inspiration to her.","1335831077"

"DepthHub","t5_2rmpy","Cool idea! Let's take a look.

Bayes' Theorem states:

&gt; The probability of X given Y (aka. the probability that x is true if we take for granted that Y is true) is equal to the probability of Y given X times the probability of X divided by the probability of Y.

Or in notational form:

&gt; P(X|Y) = P(Y|X) * P(X)/P(Y)

So, for example, if 25% of successful in vitro pregnancies result in twins, and 2% of successful pregnancies in general result in twins, and 1% of all pregnancies result from in vitro fertilization, then we can find out the probability that a given pair of twins was born via in vitro fertilization:

* P(I|T) = P(T|I)*P(I)/P(T) = .25*.01/.02 = .125, or 12.5%.


How would it work for God?

Let's say:

U = the universe as we know it
G = God

Then 

* P(G|U) = P(U|G)*P(G)/P(U)

Since we're trying to find the probability that God exists, we have to move things around a bit:

* P(G) = P(U)*P(G|U)/P(U|G)

Now let's break down the terms.

* P(U) - This means the probability of the universe as we know it existing, with or without God's help or existence. Obviously, we have no idea what this would look like, but it is a question that often enters theological debate. Since it's ""the universe as we know it"" and not just any universe, this could include the probability of the Big bang, live existing, life evolving to produce humans, and all of history unfolding exactly as it has. Alternatively, you can use something with a higher probability, like just something existing, rather than nothing. The answer to any of these questions depends on our understanding of determinism, physics, evolutionary processes, etc. Since they are incomplete, it's really hard to peg this one down. Personally, I think the probability of something existing rather than nothing is fairly high, given quantum fluctuations and whatnot, but I have an incomplete understanding. The chance that that 'something' would resemble our universe exactly? Unless all universes are identical, this seems to be an extremely small probability.

* P(G|U) - I think this is where most arguments take place. What is the likelihood that God (whichever God you're arguing about) exists given what we know about the universe? Of course, the answer changes radically depending on which 'model' of God you're using, meaning that this has to be explicitly defined in any debate. Some are clearly impossible, like a God who is sitting on my lap right now (easily falsifiable). Others have fact claims that are harder to verify (Jesus rose from the dead). Others suggest models, like intelligent design or the anthropic principle, which imply that the nature of the universe would seem to suggest that God does exist. Many atheists would contend that most, though not necessarily all, conceptions of God contain logical fallacies which make his existence impossible. People of faith would argue otherwise. Certain versions of God (say, Spinoza's God) are harder to pin down.

* P(U|G) - Or to rephrase, what are the chances, if a certain God exists, that he would make a universe like this? I think this is where people often talk about the 'problem of evil': if God is good and all-powerful, how is there evil in this universe? This also depends on the model of God you're using: if you believe that God is a being that created the universe 6,000 years ago, what is the probability that there would be fossil/genetic/biogeographical record showing millions of years of evolution, or an astronomical record showing billions of years of expansion, stellar formation, etc.? 

Results: 

Since none of these odds are easy to estimate, and they depend on what exactly you're asking (this or any universe? Fundamentalist Christian or any God?), it's not very useful for estimating the probability of God. It can, however, give you a sense of which kinds of assumptions need to be articulated when debating the subject. Namely:

- What kind of Universe are you talking about? Do things in this universe follow the laws of physics as we understand them? Does the way this universe came to be, the way celestial bodies formed in this universe, the way life came about in the universe, and the way humans came about in this universe (to name a few) correspond to what we can discover about our universe? In other words, does the universe you are using to argue for the existence of God correspond to reality? If you think the universe is 6,000 years old, for instance, you are arguing from an inaccurate universe. Your conclusions will not be trustworthy.

- What kind of God are you trying to test for? This is extremely important. Many people on r/atheism seem obsessed with disputing the God of the Christian Bible, exactly as described. Demonstrating the low probability of this God does not disprove all Gods, as there are other Gods with higher probabilities (hypothetically). For example, even if you think both are near-0, Spinoza's god would probably have a higher probability than Kirk Cameron's. In a similar vein, showing that Spinoza's god *is probable* would not mean Kirk's God is probable.

- How likely could the universe have come about without a god? Scientists have been trying to answer this for ages, and we still don't have a solid answer, although we're closer. However, we have to acknowledge that the probability or improbability of life, the universe, and everything existing in the absence of a deity is an important consideration in this debate (naturally, many people do acknowledge this).

It doesn't help that the players that he did pick looked like they couldn't be arsed, as a United fan I was utterly embarrassed by the effort put in by the team today.

The key was that the WAN IP had to be different from the local LAN IP (or at least in a different subnet).  But I could not change the IP of the Juniper.  So I had to switch every other device in the building to a different subnet.

You're effectively refusing to work because you'd rather have people like me pay for you.  That's the epitome of entitlement and laziness.

&gt;But whatever. You have your preconceived notions and have set yourself against those having a difficult time, regardless of circumstances. You've labelled me lazy and stuck-up, but you're again failing to see the point that people don't go to college and incur thousands in debt to do menial labor.

I don't care why you went to college.  

You went, and now you're done, and the best you can find is chopping wood or whatever.  That's reality.  Start chopping.  You have student loans to pay off.

&gt;Whether or not you believe it- the fact is that the next credit bubble to burst will be those defaulting on student loans and it will bankrupt this country. It comes from three generations of Americans thinking it's their right to get a degree, and now it's become a necessity to get any kind of decent paying job in many places.

If assholes like you refuse to pay for the services you've been provided, you might be right, but I doubt it will happen.

In terms of the hypothetical handgun I offer this analogy. Your friend has a friendly dog that you have known for years. Someone maliciously pokes the dog in the eye, said dog attacks. Does the dog deserve to be put down? It would have been better had the cabbie SHOWN a handgun. I feel the punks wouldn't have done anything due to consequence analysis had a gun been shown. The people in the street failed to understand that their actions have consequences. They have learned a lesson.

Now that I stopped fapping I noticed my stutter is almost completely gone in just 10 days. I am more confident when speaking but am still a little quiet, but not as quiet as I was before I started. I hope that I will stop speaking quietly soon as well. I wish I started earlier now. Seriously, if you have a porn addiction I recommend you tough it out and join nofap.","1335831102"

If you buy that Thruster, even at $69, and leave it in it's current state, it would be like buying that house and just leaving it roofless. 

I wouldn't consider buying the bike if it were $10. Something critical to the bike's operation is going to break, and it's going to happen soon. It's not the money that a Thruster isn't worth, it's everything else.

Typing papers for school is much more enjoyable with a nice keyboard.

Yeah, I do understand that not everyone is into audio like I am, but honestly a cheap ($30 Xonar DG is what I use) and a good pair of headphones (I have Audio Technica AD700s) will blow away any ""surround sound"" gaming headset.

Surround sound headsets are a gimmick. There's no point in having 5-7 tiny little speakers (drivers) in the headset, when they're all right next to your ear anyway. You'll get much better sound if you buy a nice pair of headphones that have one large driver for each ear.

Although I do understand that USB headsets are just easier for some people. Plug them in and you're good to go. No installing sound cards, drivers,  buying a separate microphone, etc.

"DepthHub","t5_2rmpy","I'm just gonna gonna go point by point since it's getting real fucking big with the quotes, haha.

First: Religion is a collection of cultural systems, belief systems, and worldviews that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. (wiki) I'm going with this, religion is a philosophical belief system that assumes a supernatural force. [This can be any supernatural force other than a technologically powerful alien race, basically] fuck it I started with this but I suppose even aliens could be a religion.

1- I'm not saying religion is the best way, I'm saying it might be and we can't know for sure. There are reasons people believe in the supernatural beyond mental frailty and fallibility: non-conditional reason for the Universe to existence, the existence of sentience, moral absolutes, feeling of God etc... These *could* be explained by science, but they aren't definitively. You can correlate studies, but saying you can produce the feeling of knowing God or that evolution has the possibility to produce sentience is not definitive. It does not absolutely shut out argument (like, say, expansion shuts out a static universe theory). In that room for reasoning, some reason the supernatural instead of ""scientific pockets of ignorance."" 

Also, if there is a God it could be more likely to feel him than a malfunction. Remember to come to this argument like abortion. It's not about the likelihood you feel God or if you like killing babies. It's about if you believe there is a God or if you believe a fetus is a person. If you accept the premise of God, it can be likely to feel him. Think of it from their standpoint and argue the premise, don't get caught up down the line of reasoning since they'll use the premise of God to contradict you anyway.

&gt;If we could measure something supernatural with equipment, in a convincing, repeatable, scientific fashion (because equipment is less likely to malfunction than our brain), then I'd start to be convinced.

The supernatural is unproven. That's like saying you won't be moral unless we can measure morality- it is by definition (for now) unmeasurable and that's why it is debated. You have chosen the path I'd agree with, I'll be good and if there's a God hopefully he'll know I tried to find him and when I came short I did the best I could. Some, however, come to believe there is a God. Remember that they can say that God just works through the principles of physics or luck, don't get caught up down the line here. It's more about, imo, whether it matters if there's a God who never shows himself explicitly (specific religions have their own issues to debate. I'm more meta-theory if God exists at all here.)

Holy shit, took this long for #2: Psychology helps us understand how we understand the Universe. If we understand how our memory works, how we can't understand statistics unless we're trained in them, how language shapes our ideas, how propaganda will work on the smartest of us, then we can better control that understanding. We have to know that no one person can create or hold a perfect philosophy and that the most brilliant scientific minds have been wrong in some ways because of preconceptions. Basically, we have to know we have to be biased to better avoid bias, lol. If that makes sense. It's like government checks and balances. Build our philosophy on principles like peer-review to check our biases like we build our government with separate branches to check our selfishness.

The only relevance religion has in my opinion is in deism, everything else doesn't play out. And if God never shows himself, or if we're in the matrix, or whatever the fuck it doesn't matter. We'll never know, so do the best we can knowing it's possible but also knowing it affects nothing we can change. But I also know many don't see it that way.

3- I think here we both end up agreeing that any belief that shuts out new ideas and evolution in order to hold to preconceptions is wrong, particularly (but not exclusively) ones that come from faith/logic/belief and not facts/reality/statistics. Those beliefs are okay, and even useful or correct, but can't be exclusionary like Newtons laws of thermodynamics can be. Always be open, and always be aware you aren't as open as you think you are. Socrates's little ""wise man knows he ain't wise"" thing. 

4- I started with the religion bit since I figured it'd be best up top since it's what we're discussing.","1335831134"

BUT what I don't agree with in the current version is the 1) extremely slow recovery time, ~~2) the gigantic detection zone, and~~^1 3) artificial inaccuracy penalty.

That last one in particular is what gets on my nerves the most and causes me to rage quit frequently. It's also the reason why bolt-action sniper rifles are now completely worthless.

Most of the people complaining about suppression actually don't want the feature removed at all. A lot of us love it! They're just frustrated when their bullets magically go out the sides of the barrel (even at point blank range) the moment they start getting sprayed down by someone with terrible aim, and not having the ability to fight back regardless of how good their aim is.

^1 *EDIT: 2) Distance and caliber currently has no bearing on the suppression value of a weapon. This needs to be fixed so higher caliber weapons like AR's and LMG's should have higher suppression capability at greater distances, while pistols would have the lowest.*","1335831136"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","A bit off topic here, but I see that you like a woman to be logical and reason unemotionally. I've heard that from a lot of men and I totally understand that many men are more rational than women and don't understand our erratic and emotional behaviour. They try to make us apply more logic and I agree to a certain extent. Many women get carried away with their emotions instead of questioning them.

But on the other side can you see how having emotions can be a good thing? I have the feeling that many men expect women to be more like them (rational) but they refuse to be more like women (emotional). And I think that's a bit unfair. Our emotions and feelings might not be as efficient as logic and sometimes they are out of place. But they also allow us to grasp things that logic couldn't. This is especially helpful in social situations. I'd just like to know what you'd think if a woman asked you to be more emotional and less rational?","1335831155"

Oh yes, there isn't an entire subreddit with 35,000+ members that is fighting to correct the wrongs of feminism or anything. There's also no such things as MRA's or the MRM. Just me. And I'm sure you can continue believing that feminism is about 'equality' while shaming me as not having enough 'education' to understand what feminism has become. Maybe you should stop reading dictionary definitions and start looking at groups for what they are.

&gt;Feminists ARE trying to change that.

Oh look! Another feminists are trying to do shit they NEVER worked towards nor have shown ANY interest in doing. Where are the 'creep-walks'? How about the 'loser-virgin-walks'? I'm actually glad there aren't these walks, trying to change biologically-ingrained 'social-motives' is sheer stupidity. Of course, feminists aren't very much fans of biology, are they now?

&gt;We don't just focus on women's issues. 

Prove it.

&gt;You might want to take a look at the hundreds of other views and theories that have stemmed from feminism. 

Oh yeah, thank you soo much feminism for all the great things you've created! Thank you so much that [radfemhub](http://agentorangefiles.com/) exists so that women can now comfortably get on a forum and talk about new methods on aborting baby boys and killing off men. Yes, thank you! Also, thank you for lesbian separatism! Oh, and all the bullshit unproven social-science theory (""patriarchy"", ""rape-culture"", etc) and [falsified statistics / fallacies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pPGijYBaVE)! How does it feel knowing that not even your own ex-chairman of NOW believes how 'male-positive' your movement is? I guess that means he's also not educated about it, right?

&gt;Feminism is a huge umbrella term for many ways of sex-positive thinking, including the push for sex-positivity towards men.

This is completely ridiculous. When was the last time a feminist promoted MALE sexuality? ANY male sexuality is seen as 'objectification' of women by your average feminist.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I completely agree with your 2nd and 3rd point. I personally didn't like the feature of having zero control over skill customization for your weapons, and that a lot of the utility skills were the same across all professions. With the system they have now it won't be that bad from basically level 40 and below. But once you get above level 40 and are doing a lot of stuff at level 80, I think it will be a flawed system. GW1 was great BECAUSE of all the different builds you could make. 

I agree a lot with your 3rd point, because at its current state Guild Wars 1 is a more sociable game than GW2, which is funny since GW2 is suppose to be an MMO. With personal-story missions it is pretty weak that you are alone, but I don't know how they could fix that, because letting a friend come along with you would be boring for the other person because they don't get to see the story (since it is your personal story).

EDIT: The problem with events at the moment is that you don't get any social interaction at all (unless you are playing with friends), everyone just runs toward the event and just does it, then leaves afterward. Like you said, it was great in other MMOs and GW1 where you actually have to communicate with others before you do a raid or missions/dungeon.

Unless ofc, they could make the system work where a friend coming along with you is a friend of your in-game character and becomes part of the story and changing the dynamic of the personal-story by A LOT.","1335831173"

Not by as big a margin as some people would like you to think. Hardly anyone even takes female rapists seriously let alone convicts them. Even the way most people define rape excludes most female perpetrators. Rape being predominately done by males IS actually a cultural stereotype.

&gt;And can you honestly find something feminine that is as bad?

I don't really like to associate negative stereotypes with gender because I'm not an asshole, but the person I replied to above came up with a few examples.

&gt;If not, then we (guessing you're male) have officially lost the battle for being the worst gender.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I'm a current college student who understands what its like to balance ADHD with college life, so I'll chime in.

It's impossible for any of us to say how the different doses will affect you.  For some, a large dose is necessary to treat their ADHD, while others may find that a smaller dose if a better fit.  Your doctor is your greatest tool.  When I first got diagnosed (4 years ago), I visited my doctor several times before I got the dosage correct, and I still visit him often to make sure everything is working the way it should.

Many people with ADHD will see a psychiatrist/therapist as part of behavioral therapy.  While medication is effective at controlling the inattentiveness associated with ADHD, behavioral therapy is necessary to help improve organizational skills or social functioning.  Visiting a therapist is also beneficial for diagnosing other conditions that may afflict someone with ADHD, namely depression or anxiety.  I saw a therapist weekly for two years after being diagnosed.  During this time I learned organizational techniques that I could apply to daily life.  This was very important because being a college student demands time management.

Like I said, the medication will help with the inattentiveness.  You will find it much easier to read a long chapter or listen to a professor's lecture without drifting off into ADHD oblivion.  However, the medication will not give you the motivation to work.  You may feel more inclined to work knowing that you won't be distracted, but you still need to get up and make yourself do the work.","1335831183"

For the cake I exchanged the 4 eggs for 2 whole eggs and 4 egg whites, increased the vanilla to a full tablespoon, and exchanged the 1c milk for 1/2 cup of lowfat buttermilk and 1/2 cup skim milk. I also bake mine in three separate layers rather than in a springform pan, and baked at 335. 

Then I created the citrus custard cream filling as follows: 

1. Mix 1.5C sugar &amp; 1/3C cornstarch in medium saucepan, gradually stir in 1/5C water								
2. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly till mixture comes to a full boil.								
3. Boil &amp; stir 1-2 minutes. Gradually stir at least half of hot mixture into 3 egg yolks, lightly beaten.								
4. Blend it back into the pan. Boil &amp; stir 2-3 additional minutes						
5. Remove from heat add 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, zest of 1 lemon, zest of 1 orange, 1/2 C lemon juice, and 1/2 C fresh orange juice. Mix thoroughly.							
													6. In mixer with whisk attachment, whip 2 cups of heavy cream on high,  then fold in citrus custard mixture. 								

~~~
As far as assembly, I started with a layer of the cake, soaked it with 1/3 cup of the tres leches sauce, then spread the citrus cream filling, repeating until the top layer of cake has been added and soaked.

How is he not belittling the people asking the question by simply saying ""no"" without giving any reasons why not? How is implying that all of them are high not patting them on the head?

&gt; I got that Obama is a funny, personable guy who is nonetheless unafraid to honestly answer stupid questions?

Perhaps because you probably don't feel personally affected by it and so you don't care. Or maybe because you probably still believe that politicians can be real people. 

The simple fact is that if Obama personally had any compassion for medical marijuana patients, he has the executive power to reschedule marijuana to a medicinal status without the approval of Congress, and he could call attention to the widespread injustice of arresting non-violent people en masse. He would not have personal authority to stop that, but he could at least protect medical marijuana users of his own accord and he's not doing it. Most likely for his own political expedience. And he probably won't do it after he gets reelected either.

&gt; They were clever, and most of the audience was laughing with him

They weren't clever at all, they were based on stupid stereotypes and were only said for cheap laughs. He was playing to the meme that anybody who favors drug decriminalization or drug legalization *must* be a drug user, and to the meme that anyone who uses or used drugs must not be a credible or intelligent person. Even as he himself is a confessed user of marijuana and cocaine. That kind of thing is exactly what I'm talking about. It doesn't matter what Obama actually thinks or if he might have empathy or whatever, because he doesn't take action on things which are directly under his authority.

Actions speak louder than words. Obama doesn't *have* to directly say ""I think drug prohibition is great"" when he takes this snide, mocking tone in his words *and* contributes to increased funding and increased enforcement and arrests. The annual number of arrests has consistently gone up under his presidency, as has the annual expenditures of enforcement and intelligence.... As it pretty much has over the last ~40 years.

Look at the Summit of the Americas just recently. All these Latin American leaders have legitimate reasons to call for ending or at least altering drug policy and Obama just outright dismisses it and paints their position as not credible, with no elaborative discussion at all.

**TL;DR it doesn't matter at all if Obama ""seems like a nice guy"" or not, what he does matters and how he talks about (or doesn't talk about) certain issues matters and he, like most drug war presidents before him does not seem to care much about the human cost, whether it's an abducted and killed citizen in Latin America or a non-violent, non-larcenous American with a criminal record. He has at least some power to push against all of that and he doesn't do it in favor of staying the course. What does that sound like?""**","1335831190"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","The first paragraph is the issue--it assumes that feminism aligns itself with certain ideals, but that premise is incorrect.

&gt; Would anybody dispute that feminism is a socio-political movement on behalf of women?

Originally, yes, as feminism is the new title for the women's liberation movement, which aimed primarily at assuring voting and property rights, amongst other legal rights. And then there was second wave feminism, which started out aiming to change cultural views of women, particularly involving the family unit, abortion laws, the creation of battered women's shelters, marital rape laws, and a bunch of other stuff.

However, this is when things get complicated. After second wave feminism, feminism itself splintered heavily. There's third wave feminism, post-feminism, a bunch of others, and related to post-feminism is equity feminism, which is the idea that feminism, as a political entity with a degree of pull, is responsible for promoting the rights of all, and an attempt to return feminism to earlier, more egalitarian roots than more recent ""girl power"" feminism which focused more on promoting women than pure equality.

&gt; Would anybody dispute that feminism proffers a particular analysis of man-woman relations?

Men are pigs? Generally the idea of the male as the sexual aggressor? This is actually a major divide within the feminist community, and is known as the feminism sex wars or something like that. Sex-positive feminism is strongly against any sort of notion that males are sexual aggressors--that would go against the whole point of sex-positive feminism, where women are sexual beings who have desires and are capable of acting on them. As far as other branches, no such concept even exists within post-feminism or equity feminism.

&gt; Would anybody dispute that feminist analysis holds women to be globally disadvantaged, by some objective and quantifiable standard of measurement, in comparison with men?

Globally? No, of course not, feminists definitely hold that women around the globe are disadvantaged, especially in heavily religious countries, due to the sheer lack of advancement in civil rights in third-world countries. I can't think of a country where men can't vote, or have to wear veils, or a number of other things. There are definite disadvantages to being a man in those countries, but basic human rights, in my eyes, take priority, as they have the highest impact on quality of life. The impact of not having basic rights may not exactly be measurable, but I think we can both agree that they're necessary for any degree of happiness.

In the US, where I live, for the most part, yes, I would contest that--men and women both have laws which are sexist against them, and post-feminism (along with equity feminism) contests the idea of bringing gender into it at all, much less turning things into a pissing contest over who's more oppressed.

&gt; Finally, would anybody dispute that feminist analysis concludes an element of male authorship in the comparative disadvantagement of women?

That depends on what you mean by male authorship, and again, on the branch of feminism. Equity feminism falls short in this regard in my eyes, as it focuses on equity to the extent where it closes its eyes to the very real factor that is the contribution that sexist thinking--within anyone--contributes to inequality. However, equity feminism would dispute that idea 100%--as would I, as the statement is a sweeping generalization about men. Sure, some men are sexist, and some men may have decided to not include a woman or to use their strength to overpower a woman, and so on. But all men are not sexists, and you can't blame a gender for people's actions.","1335831191"

Consider the hypotenuse. If, instead of a diagonal, you draw a set of stair steps, the sum of the lengths of the steps is x + y. If you get smaller and smaller stair steps, the lengths of the steps is still x + y. What if you shrink the stair steps infinitely small? That is, to make a diagonal line? It looks like a paradox, but you can then talk about why it's not.

There's also a stupid ""proof"" that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... = -1 or something like that. I think it hinges on an erroneous division by zero or infinity or something.","1335831193"

Renekton, Talon, and Vladimir are all well due a sale, as is Viktor where the newer champs are concerned, but instead of discounting those they seem to be cutting down on the number of 6300 champs on sale in a given week instead.

From the factory they are set to usually some level below what we'd think of ""high performance"" in favor of fuel economy and in some cases reliability.  Many times people can tune a stock car on a dyno (pretty much a machine you strap your car on with rollers to measure horsepower and torque, while you plugin to the computer to measure the air to fuel ratio and any other sensors you'd need to look at like boost pressure, etc.  I can't really explain it like you're 12 any better...)

While monitoring these you can take an otherwise stock car (no new pipes or engine mods) and tune the computer to change the fuel injection and timing to make it perform better than it did with factory settings.  When getting into bigger mods where you actually are changing parts (adding a turbo for example) you ABSOLUTELY need to tune for these new parts as the factory settings will not deliver enough fuel to compensate for the higher amount of power, resulting in engine damage if you don't tune it.","1335831199"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Ok, a religion is not defined only by supernatural beliefs. One of the main difference between a religion and a philosophy is traditions and rituals, there aren't any in philosophy. So, when you say that Buddhism can be separated from supernatural claims and still be called Buddhism, while true, is as much a reinvented belief as the claim that Christianity lacking supernatural claims is still Christianity. You seem to think that the act of one group's reinvention of an ideology is somehow different than another groups reinvention of an ideology. Christianity takes its name from Christ, divorce Christ from the supernatural, and you're left with only his teachings, who's to say a group of people can't still call it Christianity. You say so? Why? Buddhism has always been Buddhism, so even though there are different sects why do they all still call it Buddhism, according to you they should call it different names. Oh, but then Buddhism is not the same as Christianity when divorcing different aspect of it, just because you say so, right?

&gt;nothing is necessarily required to be a Buddhist, outside of applying the teachings of Siddhartha Buddha to your daily life

"eu3","t5_2soil","Well I've only been playing for a few months, but my current game is one where I united the HRE and have now gained control of nearly all of the Slavic European countries and most of the French territories. So, here's how I played it.

* I vassalized nearly all the territories I could afford to. Seeing as I was playing to unite the HRE anyways, I figured I could do without them for a few years until I reclaimed them upon Re-Uniting the Empire as one state. Not to mention that if you have unlawful Imperial territories it has negative effects.

* I declared war on larger HRE nations and demanded that they release the smaller ones they'd absorbed. Probably the most effective method for earning Authority.

* When the Reformation started I did my best to enforce religious unity. This became rather difficult and looking back I would do my best to unite the HRE before the reformation hits, as the rapid spread of Protestantism is difficult to deal with, as you lose Imperial Authority for every Protestant nation.

This and more is also all covered in the handy-dandy wiki article:

From [this](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/294/5/551.1.full): ""The difficulty of estimating excess mortality due to overweight is greatly exacerbated in elderly persons because of the high prevalence of chronic disease and loss of lean mass; analyses that simply use current BMI may be particularly misleading in this group.

Just to clarify; I know that not every man is definitely the kind of guy who would use you or women, or would want to toy with your emotions. Some men do still have integrity, and people do make mistakes/do things they regret. 

I think that a lot of people have different approaches to different situations - It just depends on the kind of person you are. I don't feel that one person who just says ""Yes"" in an instant - or even a ""No"" - really appreciates the gravity of a situation such as this. Obviously things ended for a reason, those reasons should be addressed and thought out before someone attempts to rekindle a relationship that is otherwise set to fail. 

Another point, in busy times of high stress, people who are ""over-thinkers"" may need more time to consider themselves and those around them; what they have done and what they must do, and what the effects of those actions may be. 

Evidently, I'm speaking from a sense of high entitlement. Anyone in the situation he's in would have no reason to ask or expect anything of you, especially not for you to consider or even agree to take him back. I'm sure his mind is just full of other issues, and under a lot of pressure to perform academically, and perhaps he will pay most dearly for it. 

One thing I know for sure, is that he misses ordering pizza, eating ""Phish Food"", and holding you while you watch silly movies together. He just needs to train himself to relax and to experience life as it happens. It's definitely not that he doesn't respect you: He just worries that becoming one again so soon would cause those around you to lose respect for you, and if anyone deserves to lose face or image, it's him and not you.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;You can't eat a refrigerator. And yes, food stamps exist. Ergo, you don't have a starvation problem under the status quo. You also have a sedentary culture being plied with cheap corn products, which leads to obesity.
Get rid of food aid and you're not going to see people start eating their appliances or turning into trim, toned supermodels.

I'm wondering how they are on the verge of starving if they can afford all of those things.

&gt;Stimulus is a short-term remedy, so there's no harm in step 1). We aren't printing money indefinitely, only over the slump.

Incorrect. When you print money you are lowering the interest rate and shifting the LM curve to the right. This also leads to a shift in the aggregate demand curve which leads to a temporary increase in output at a small increase in prices. The problem is that this is PURELY short term. In the medium run labor and prices adjust to the increase in the money supply and the AS curve shifts to the left which leads to a contraction in output and a further increase in prices. So basically, all you've done in the medium run is raise prices.

&gt;To 3), accessing credit is a well-worn and time-honored technique upon which the entire financial sector is based. And with an effective interest rate at roughly zero, the US should honestly just be bundling revenue into bricks and shelving it, then borrowing the balance. If ever there was a time to borrow, now is that time. The investments we make with borrowed money today can serve future generations. Our children will be thrilled to enjoy the infrastructure we can construct using today's ridiculously cheap federal borrowing rate.

At the same time they are enjoying paying back our debts plus accumulated interest. You are also negating the presence of crowding out which restricts the impact policies have on the market. 

&gt;Likewise, we have a very simply means of tracking income eligibility in this country - the IRS. Jackpots, endowments, wages, capital gains - all this income is tracked and recorded by the IRS. And since it is tax-advantageous for businesses to report wages and expenditures to the IRS, it is easy for the IRS to track when the money isn't reported as income on the other side of the equation.

Do you recognize how much bureaucracy that is?

&gt;You have metrics to determine eligibility. If an individual meets these metrics, he is de facto ""deserving"". You are always free to argue 65 year olds don't ""deserve"" Medicare/SS and are just lazy old people. Or an individual that has been an active job seeker for six months doesn't ""deserve"" a seventh month of UI assistance. However, the goal of a social safety net isn't to make self-appointed ""laziness"" arbiters happy. It is to disperse money to those that meet eligibility.

But my entire point there is that there are people who should NOT be getting money. Unemployment benefits raise unemployment. 

&gt;You really haven't addressed the simple growth equation at all. Amid all this verbage, it seems you completely forgot about ""Simon Kuznets"" and ""APC"" entirely. I am still not clear where you argument is claiming that increasing money flow to individuals most likely to purchase consumer goods won't lead to economic growth?

Was actually going to post that. So we have our equation of C = a + b(Y - T) where a is the autonomous consumption you are clinging to. Now, one of the big problems with the Keynesian consumption model is that you really can't define autonomous consumption. A bum living on the side of the road, what is his autonomous consumption? Does it include rent? What if you can move out of that place and live elsewhere? How do you measure autonomous consumption? Now, remember, even then, APC is C/Y so it includes autonomous consumption and even after that it is still found that APC is steady over time.","1335831215"

The reasoning behind the proposal is sound - kids tend to forget material if they're out of school for too long, and we don't live in an agrarian society where the kids need to go home to help out on the farm.

That said... I think the kids deserve the break. They work hard, and as an adult that takes few enough vacations as it is, I think it would be a little tough on the kids to expect that they should be able to put their little noses to the grindstone 12 months out of the year.

"Flyers","t5_2ribt","Great season, always a strong offense but the defence struggled. After trading away captain Mike Richards in the off season and leading goal scorer Jeff carter, it was a queestion as to how the offence would fair. Claide Giroux stepped up and has played his best season along with Scott Hartnell. Several rookies have had extremely impressive years as well such as Matt read who was the leading rookie goal scorer this season and Sean couterier (also known as coots). The biggest story this year however was Ilia Bryzgolov who was aquired in the offseasom and signed to a 51 million dollar contract. He struggled throughout the season and just hit his best stride of late in march when he was the best goalie im the NHL, won first star of the week twice im a row and had a 3 game shut out streak and 4 shutouts in 5 games. The season emded leaving them riding high to challenge the pens in the playoffs. 

The biggest rival of this season would arguably be the Rangers. Having lost every meeting against them this season (most notably im the winter classic) the flyers nation is filled with hatred towards them. Another strong rival is your bruins as you may well know. After beating the bruins in a historic four game winning streak to come back from the brink of elimination in the 2010 easterm semifinals the bruins hated the flyers but got their revenge last season when they swept the flyers in the same round lf the playoffs the flyers were triumphant in the year before. The oenguins have always been a big rival amd have caused some of the most fun to watch and violent games of the year. The devils have always been a strong rival (lesser of late but im sure it will be rekindled in this series) amd finally the islanders used to be a big rival but they are mostly pitied nowadays.

Other than that, been doing pretty good.

The biggest problem I've found:  Butter.  It's in everything around here (Wisconsin).  A lot of the time I've just gotta say, ""well, not sure exactly what oil this is"" and just go for it.

I will say that I just feel healthier lately.  Lost a few lbs already and just have a bit more energy.  Also, I find myself eating less food overall (unless I'm out drinking, hehe), which is a good feeling because I used to go around stuffing my face at every meal.

That being said, I simply enjoy interacting with people much better. If that is limiting myself, then I'll accept that, as a nuance of my personality. I can see the mathematical and theoretical basis of several dimensions, and wormholes. They do make sense. I just prefer a different study.

I respect your perspective. But I will disagree on my 'denigrating formal approaches'. At Uni, one of my workout buddies was a physicist. He explained to me why he liked physics, and how everything related to each other and could be explained through mathematics. He couldn't understand how I could understand it, yet not love it.

Turns out these things are not bi-directional, and I operated the handle backwards: mangling the cork before pushing it into the bottle. The couple was watching the whole time, and asked me to go get another bottle, as they were *not* going to drink Grange with pieces of cork floating in it.

Luckily, my dad only yelled at me for an hour or so, before re-hiring me (he used to fire me on a pretty regular basis in those days). We ran the Grange through a coffee filter and drank it ourselves.

You're a broken record.

The answer to this question is not relevant to our discussion.  It's you just trying to move the goal posts.  We've established that 

* Old God entrapped Adam
* Old God was a jealous and vengeful 
* John's God differs fundamentally from Old God
* New God possesses agape-love, with unconditional love and brotherhood, which differs from Abraham's God of conditional love.

Leading us to conclude 

* New God and Old God are different god(s)
* They're the same god, just ""god"" has a personality disorder
* The god of the bible is imaginary.

And there is no reason to pick any of the above over the other.

Slim Shady- the insane one that eats shovels of cocaine

various sequences of codepoints (including sequences of one codepoint) map to graphemes, which are still abstract in the sense that they don't have a fixed representation in pixels/vectors.

graphemes map 1:1 (more or less) with glyphs, which are what your fonts actually tell your monitor/printer to draw.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","As a Marxist, classical liberal but first and foremost, a materialist thinker, I disagree with the notion that human affairs need be conducted in a hierarchical manner. I simply do no believe that there are any logical assertions or data that makes hierarchy natural. ""Human nature"" is a term so often used in the context of explaining macro sociology and political consequences, but it has no merit. All such constructions of civilization are merely blocks of rational individual human beings. Hence I cannot see how such huge and complex things such as war and government can be reduced to ""Its just human nature"". 

Human nature and plots of geographical lines with alloted lines for boundaries and its respective population, its production of weapons, rations, and consumer goods, and government composed of individuals whose power only extends through other individuals of sub ranks, going to war with each other based on the interests of various people, be it the bourgeoisie who have imaginary claims to machine, or religious extremists or what not, does not simply follow logically. That is, there is a huge gap between human nature and its implications in a greater society. Ex, war, governance, etc.

It is stupid to say ""Human nature causes wars"". It makes no sense. (I know this wasn't your claim, but I am drawing a parallel).

So now I have to ask, what about human ""nature"" disables us to live peacefully under a non hierarchal government or economy? We are rational. Given that the world is ridden of its constructs of racism, sexism, nationalism, and other remains of a hierarchical society, what part of human nature tells us ""Oh please give me an oppressor!"". Certainly you can feel that society is progressing in this regard. Just think, just about 60 years ago blacks were still institutionally discriminated against by our national government.

I agree humans are self interested, but greed is an entirely different thing. Whereas one claims that humans are rational in perusing their values, the other asserts that human's only value is money and power. I think when you discern between the two, a simple observation is enough to say that humans are not greedy. Can people not value equality?

The composing factors of society and its political and economic institutions continuously reinforces its own existence. Capitalism breeds such greed just as a society based on slavery produces racism. But yet, even in the midst of a perpetual cycle, there seems to always be a force of social progression, brought on by the vary nature of human nature that seeks to progress, to rationalize, and to do away with oppression.

So then, why is a hierarchal society so imperative and so consistent with human nature?

I went through this 2 years ago with my late spouse, who ultimately decided to donate her body to cancer research.  It made me aware enough to do my own research on how I want my corpse to be disposed of.  It is pretty difficult and expensive to find a place that allows natural burial - plain coffin, unenbalmed corpse.  I decided to donate my corpse to a forensic body farm so that it can just decompose naturally, be eaten by vultures and animals, etc.

Because inaction toward that unacceptable behavior in this context is equivalent to collaborating with the police in that it helps achieve their PR goals and provides pretext for their assault and arrest of all protesters.

But Korean soju (which I love, please don't take this as some sort of anti-soju rant) is distilled and filtered, and then gets processed with artificial/natural flavorings (in some cases) and sometimes high fructose corn syrup. Some of the bigger brands have ""lady-friendly"" versions with lower alcohol, higher added fructose, and sometimes herby aromatics in the mix. But overall, soju is awesome.

1. Do you have to fight for every cell on the map, or are some cells ""empty""(or filled with a big river/mountain/desert) and you can just own them by passing them? I understand there are towns that have to be conquered, but is everything between the humans and the nekros filled with neutral cells that don't put up a fight EVERY time? is the movement really more like mario where you have some blind spots between the real levels?
2. What else can you do on the worldmap, except pushing from one cell to another? I guess you controll your nekro-tower on the world map, right?
3. How much will other factions attack you and push the boarders back to your nekro tower? can you build defenses on cells? can you only attack the enemy on their cells, or are there defensive matches that are different from attacking?

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I loved the PvE in the game, well worth the 60$ and more. The scenery, NPC's, Dynamic Events only need a bit of tweaking but are almost spot on and well done. However, I absolutely HATED the PvP. I tried to go in three times for around 30 minutes each. I went through the tutorials first, but when I finally got into the world I had no idea what to do. I fully expected being thrust near a fight, but was instead placed at the green base, where only about 5 other people were. The first two times I went in, I kept looking for a fight, but it took too long to get to any of the contested areas, and the waypoints were not unlocked until you reached them. The second time, I almost got to one of the combat zones, but was blocked by one of the outpost's walls and mountains and I could not find a way around them for 10 minutes. Finally, on my third attempt, I reached a combat zone...some enemies were laying siege to one of our castles. However, there was no way to get into the castle because the only door in was right in front of where the enemy was laying siege. I felt completely helpless and really couldn't do anything but lay back and watch. I think I am missing out on something (if I am, please explain it so I can get the good experience of PvP next BWE), and I really think ArenaNet needs to work on the tutorial for PvP more.","1335831297"

Nintendo will likely offer more features in a cross platform game than the other two, with the tablet of a controller.

Do you really think graphics and FPS are much more than a gimmick that Call of Duty and Halo brag about? I'm not arguing that Nintendo won't have the least powerful system; I'm just saying that the key mistakes with the Wii(for ""hardcore"" gamers) was the low end graphics that alienated them but this time around they will probably offer graphics that are acceptable but not spectacular.

He should wanna go every four hours, try to be there when you can and once he wakes up, put him in the litter pan till he goes. Give him a reward for use it properly.

For my ferret, I removed all bedding all together. To train her properly, I found out she is fond of one of my shirts. So I put that, the bed, food bowl and water in the other corners of her cage. They are clean animals (Usually) and will want to keep things they adore clean. My baby does tend to be a brat and lift her litter pan off the hooks. You can latch them on. Also, with litter, use the ferret approved litter. It's better for them, biodegradable and flushes. I never notice the smell till I'm cleaning the pan.

Do you have any toys in the cage for him to play with? A hammock, sleepsack, rattle toys made with hard plastic or squeakers would do fine. Careful on the squeakers though, my baby broke her squeaker so now I have to fix it.

A form of punishment, which I do not use unless needed be is rubbing of the ears. As kits their mothers would lick their ears to discipline them. So they don't enjoy their ears being touched. I don't like to use this method, but with mine scruffing works just fine.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was in High School I had a part time job a large chain supermarker store. I only worked like 10-15 hours a week though to keep on top of home work, as a result I took random jobs helping out neighbours and they would pay me like 10 to 20 dollars for like 4 hours of work. It was pretty much slave labor but I'm a big guy, and built so it was easy. Anyway, this old lady who lives across from our house was trying to make a garden, and I agreed to help her out. I knew she was struggling with money so I didn't take any payment, I always had more than enough money and was really only doing it for extra on the side. So I go over and ask her if she wants help, she agrees and plays out the helpless old lady card and asks me to move this massive trailer load of dirt into her back yard. Now her back yard was pretty secluded so I couldn't just drag the trailer around there and dump it all there, I had to grab a shovel and move the dirt with a wheelbarrow. Ended up taking about 5 hours and when I had finally finished it all she came out and told me I had put the dirt 1 metre from where it was supposed to be. I apologized and asked if she wanted it moved and she agreed. I went back to work and 1 hour later was done. She comes out again and says it's meant to be level so she can plant her plants. I try telling her she didn't say that and she apologizes and I end up leveling all the dirt down throughout her whole back yard. Two hours later she comes out again and tells me that it's wrong and I should ""get the fuck off my lawn"" (before I put the newly fresh dirt / soil there it was a barren wasteland with no grass) taken aback I apologize and ask her if I can do anything else and she tells me to fuck off or she will call the cops. I get outta there and go home to sleep. The next day I am walking past her house and see she is happily planting trees in the back yard with no changes to it at all.

&gt; Uh.. what? Israel Beitenu and Labor certainly accept the two-state solution, and Shas and the Torah Judaism would agree to everything if they get enough money for Yeshivas (they certainly had no problem supporting Oslo).   The only party that would have any problem with that is the 3-seat Jewish home.

Likud's charter *still* states that the Palestinians should never have a state.  They never changed it.

Israel Beitenu wants to redraw the border to grab a big chunk of the West Bank, but give a lot of Arab inhabited Israel to the Palestinians.  This is a fringe idea, and is probably incompatible with any reasonable final resolution favored by anyone else.  

Of the three main parties in the coalition, Labor supported a deal (they got close at Taba after giving a bad offer at Camp David).   Israel Beitenu supports an extreme idea that won't fly with anyone else.  Likud's leader [grudgingly supported a two state solution after great US pressure but refused to commit to the idea](http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/01/us-israel-government-shalom-interview-idUSTRE5201RB20090301), though Likud's charter still says otherwise, and its membership [is strongly pro-settler](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/151474).

Back in December of 1921 an “Amazon Army” of miners’ wives, sweethearts, daughters and sisters marched through the coalfields for three days in support of striking miners against injustice and unfair labor laws. “It’s time again for the women of southeast Kansas to unite and make our voices heard,” Ross said. “We want politicians to know that they have our attention and we vote.”

The unskilled player sees the attacker and misses, because he is unskilled.
The skilled player sees the defender at the same time, but hits, because he is skilled.

The skilled player did not suppress the unskilled player, because hitting your opponent does not apply suppression.
The unskilled player did suppress the skilled player, because missing your opponent does apply suppression.

While it doesn't happen all the time, the unskilled player can sometimes win this situation because he missed, and in turn the skilled player can sometimes lose this situation because he aimed well.  I shit you not this actually fucking happens.  It really does.  The person who missed WINS (sometimes).  That is because by the time the firefight is over, the person who originally hit finds that his bullets are traveling at 90 degree angles from his gun barrel, and the person who originally missed finally manages to start hitting his target and lives with ~2% hp left.

What I'm doing is drawing a distinction between intentional suppression and unintentional suppression (missing).

I know for someone recovering from an eating disorder it may be easier said than done, but eat when you are hungry and stop when you aren't. Try that for a month, maybe looking at your caloric intake weekly to make sure you are getting enough, but it's really more than calories in/calories out, it's what you eat when. IF you are at the weight you want/should be and you find you are gaining or loosing make adjustments.  For people not trying not to loose weight and are on this diet, the addition of white potatoes (or just ""healthy carbs"" in general) often helps balance things out. Good luck, I recommend doing it for a month without too much calculating, but keep a journal so if body composition is going the wrong way (whatever that may be for you) you know exactly what you've been doing and then you can post it here and there are plenty of people that can help you adjust to what is good for you individually.

At my work there have been times where we need a female and due to company policy we can't just say this. So we have go through the application process with males too - which not only wastes our time but their time too. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that I believe local businesses should be able to do this. If someone were to have a problem with it, they could just not apply or even not visit the pizza shop anymore. Or talk to the owners and tell them how you feel! I bet they're not demons.

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","So many players to speculate on.... I think our most important appointment might be director of football. I'd love Rafa to return in that capacity, I think that with a bit of money, he'd make some very good additions.

Of your list, I think Strootman and Giroud would be excellent (I saw an article talking about us poaching Giroud for cheap earlier today, he looks like a player who could trouble the net more than the woodwork). They'd both add quality while possibly solving two major problems we have. Kagawa's never going to happen, though. 

At the moment, Rasmus Elm and Jackson Martinez are the players we seem to be linked to most. I don't know that much about either, but from what little I do know, they seem like they'd add to positions we're a little weak in. Gaston Ramirez would be an excellent addition on the wing, there's been speculation linking us to him as well. Victor Moses is out of contract and could be a good addition to the squad. Faling that, I think Junior Hoillet could bring some serious pace and crossing on the cheap - they aren't CL options, but we're not currently a CL club and we have to look at players who can do well at our level and potentially develop into excellent players as we work to grow back into an excellent team.

Aquilani returning would be excellent, I've already expressed my thoughts on the thread about him. Should he not return, I'd like Gylfi to stay at Swansea but he'd be a great addition to our squad if he does have to leave them - if he can't become a Swansea player, I'd much rather we have him than any of our rivals in the league. 

And while I hesitate to draw up a wishlist, I've been interested in André Schürrle (Leverkusen) for a while now. Can't say I've seen anything to even suggest he might be an option, but he fits everything we're looking for.

We were linked with Stevan Jovetic when Rafa was around, and with Fiorentina having a pretty torrid season, it might be worth re-explroing that - tremendously creative player and I think he and Suarez would tear shit up together every week. Borja Valero is another player who'd add a lot to our central midfield, I think he's versatile enough to fit almost any role in the center. Keisuke Honda would be anothr one with experience, creativity and quality, and he looks to be leaving Russia.

I'm a big fan of Javi Martinez and Ander Herrera, but their Europa league campaign means they'll probably have even more suitors than before, probably pushing us out of the picture. 

Does anyone know much about Nacional? Considering we're developing a relationship with them, it's worth taking a close look at some of their promising players.

Probably a dozen more I just can't remember right now. Hard to speculate when we don't know who's going to be leaving/staying/returning and how much money's available, which is why I think DoF is the main concern at the moment.

I've danced this fandango before.  Everything except the physical dimension of the relationship feels eerily repaired, right?  The things you used to fight about aren't experienced as Major Issues in the same way as they used to be, because your expectations (and his) are fundamentally different.  But you're posting here because you aren't getting what you really want.  

This will be hard to hear, but ol' boy is **not** the only man in your town (though it be new and unfamiliar) who would take an interest in you.  If you wonder whether you should start dating, then DO IT.  He's obviously not letting any worries of alienating you stop him from dating.  You may feel as if you're good together, but you're not.  You're comfortable.  No, ""comfortable"" is too generous: you're *familiar*.  I would advise you to seek out new friendships and relationships, even at the risk of making yourself acutely uncomfortable.  Learn more about what you need in a partner, and what you cannot tolerate.  You need to feel safe communicating your needs, period.  If that means that you need to do some work on yourself, then do that first.  If and when you choose to be with someone again, the next guy needs to be one who is better able to respond to your communications without giving in to anger.  

If you continue to see the ex, let him sleep over, etc., then you will feel much, **much** worse before you ever start to feel better.  ""No Contact"" has gained currency as a strategy because it's the only thing that anyone can rely on.  Other strategies *might* work, but when executed with total commitment, No Contact never fails.  They don't call these things ""bend-ups,"" do they?  It's going to feel like kicking an addiction, but you have to put some distance between yourself and this guy.  Yes, you ended the relationship.  Yes, he may feel skittish about becoming involved with you again.  He may be as right to feel the way he does as you were right to end the relationship.  But if it ended, then it was supposed to end.  If you were to reconcile, then the same issues as before would not fail to manifest themselves again.  They have not been eliminated.  They are lying dormant.  

I realize that you may not yet be at a point of desiring from anyone else the same type of intimacy that you share, or shared, with this man.  But you must get there, by any means necessary.  It's a tall order, but if dating is out for now, then learn to enjoy being single for a while.  You're still you, with or without your ex.  So learn to be You Without Him again.  I'm here to tell you that it's possible.  But you have to want it really, really badly.  So how badly do you want it?","1335831338"

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","&gt;I was referring to the fact that women initiate domestic violence as much as men do, and majority of domestic violence is reciprocal. This leads to domestic violence not being gendered.

First, source for domestic violence being started equally? Extraordinary (by which I simply mean extra-ordinary) claims require extraordinary warrants.

Second, that's not what feminists mean when they say ""violence is gendered."" They're talking about how methods of force are seen as ""male"" by many and methods of compromise (normally called ""surrendering"" or ""wimping out"") are seen as ""female."" 

Claims that gender and violence intersect don't have literally 0 to do with violence being carried out by men or women, but the premise doesn't depend on that either... I'm really interested to know what literature base you're drawing this from. Who are the authors you're reading to gain this categorization of feminism? I've read mostly Butler, Irigiray, Peterson, and Tickner.


&gt;The conviction rates for women for violent crimes are also lower, as are the sentences. We justify female violence by blaming it on men, by saying the man was beaten because he deserved it; we justify spousal murder by saying he deserved it because she was abused or mistreated in the past, even if when the woman committed murder and her life wasn't in immediate danger.

That's pretty messed up -- but it is a hair more complicated than you make it out to be. The question of whether lethal force is a just response to repeated domestic violence was deemed controversial enough to warrant a place as a high school debate topic -- several times! (Source: http://www.wdca.org/about/history/53-past-lincoln-douglas-resolutions )

I think there is an underlying premise here that women are, on average, as violent as men -- (false: http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/gender.cfm ). What do you mean by conviction rate? You mean when an accused party is found guilty? I think you need data to show that women are let off WRONGLY, not that more are let off -- isn't it possible that there were simply less violent crimes committed by women? Sources please.



&gt;We turn a blind eye to violent and sexually predatory women. We don't even recognize the rape of men by women unless a foreign object is used.

Yes! That's certainly true! While current legal language has removed the gendered language and made it apply to both sexes, there's still a major double standard. People know that male genital function is (can be) involuntary. The double standard is messed up -- but WHY is there a major double standard? Why does society view women as incapable of rape? What's the flip side of society thinking that men are too strong to be raped by women?

I actually would like an answer to those questions -- I obviously have my own opinion, but I'm interested in your take on it.

&gt;Suggesting we investigate violence to be gendered when all accounts show men and women are both quite violent-we just ignore female violence-doesn't follow. Violence perpetration isn't gendered, we just refuse to acknowledge women as equally capable of violent, and trying to gender to issue will only further confound the landscape to where only violent men are to blame.

From above,

1. WHY do we think of women as incapable of violence?
2. Men seem to be more violent...
3. I don't think ""gendered violence"" is exactly what you think it is... does my previous explanation make any sense?

I'm quite enjoying this conversation, and I hope I don't seem to hostile! I'm learning a lot of perspective I previously thought was complete bunk. I'm not going to lie, I think it's still 98% bunk, but I'm learning a lot from this conversation.","1335831339"

&gt; Clearly the Mormon plutocracy favors men over women.

I don't deny that women are asked to speak in General Conference less than men. I'm just not sure we can get from that fact to favoring men over women. It certainly does mean that the leadership asks more men to speak, so maybe we could say ""clearly the Mormon leadership asks men to speak in General Conference more than it asks women.""

I guess my point is simply that, while I agree with you that it's not good that so few women ""get"" to speak in General Conference, that doesn't necessarily mean that anyone's sexist. Of course, it doesn't necessarily mean that anyone is *not* sexist, either.

"Rammstein","t5_2rxvy","I was at Worcester yesterday and I got there at 6am. There was a large group (15-20 people) who was spot saving in front of us, which have been following them around, and even though me and my partner were the second ""group"" in line, really we barely managed to get on the barrier (it was a small stage, for the record, and probably really only held 50 of us and 30 would've had a decent view). If you only want to be near it, you'd be safe probably with anywhere from 10-12 in the morning.

And for the record, its not as easy to push to the barrier as everyone makes it seem. Several guys tried to do it to myself and the people around me and flat out fights broke out. Don't bother trying to get to the barrier itself if you didn't get it in the beginning--you will end up elbowed or hit depending on how aggressive the people in the front are and you are. We tossed a guy for getting too aggressive with the women up there. So beware moving through the crowd, the front people have been there all morning and are not about to give it up without a fight.

Edit: Just to say this, I arrived at 6am on the advice of other R+ fans online who had seen them on the LIFAD tour. Those locations were a lot larger and more accessible than the current ones and Cleveland will probably be busier than Worcester was for me. Make friends with the people around you, you will need them to hold your spot if numbers aren't handed out (they didn't at Worcester) and they will help guide you to public restrooms and share food/water with you. The people in line were amazing near us and so helpful.","1335831342"

I remember playing for about four hours Sunday afternoon with this Warrior and Elementalist, and boy did we win some games. They played amazingly and we ended up getting on mumble even when we were against each other. Other good players kept coming and going, but they stayed for a long time. 

One game, we (I was Mesmer this whole time) did a split at the beginning; the Warrior ran straight to the Henge (We were Blue, so we were closest to it.) and the Ele and I ran to the Mine behind their team. Sat at the middle door to see if anyone went straight to the keep, but they didn't so we followed them over. Sat behind the rock right by the deck and waited until they were almost done capping, but not quite. 

We had previously planned to let him go in to the Mine and Ride the Lightning back out down towards Svanir so they'd chase him. 

Ended up working before they finished the cap (there were only two there) and I came in behind and we started up 2-0. It's so much more fun when you have coordination.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","The squat chapter in starting strength is a great explanation of this. [This article covers it](http://startingstrength.com/articles/squat_rippetoe.pdf) pretty well.

One of the purposes of low-bar squatting is making use of the hip musculature, especially the hamstrings. But the more forward the knees are at the bottom of the squat, the more the hamstrings will have shortened, since the hip is more extended and the knee is more flexed in that position. If the hamstrings are shortened at the bottom of the movement they can't contribute as much to the drive up. But if the knees don't move forward as much, the hip angle is more closed -- the torso leans forward more -- and there's less knee flexion so the hamstrings are placed in a more mechanically advantageous position.  

But high-bar squats are more about maintaining an upright torso, and doing so means the knees have to go forward in order to squat deep. Look at Olympic lifters, their knees are way forward at the bottom of their squats. But this type of squat will tend to involve proportionally more quads and less hamstrings as a result of the joint angles inherent in the movement.","1335831351"

Also, SF is surprisingly small... and Everyone knows everyone else. LA has hipsters too. LA has much better food and more scenes to take part in. LA is also much more diverse. SF is pretty homogenous. Also, SF people are very trendy and they love nothing more than to stand in a giant queue for ice cream or brunch or something.

It's important to me that we establish online libraries, even if they're illegal rebel libraries.

And I buy CDs that I like after I consume them from said libraries. My CD library grows everyday, and it's easily my most purchased luxury.

For instance, commenters are not allowed to say ""This post is not offensive"" or ""This is not SRS worthy."" Instead, if you do not know why the shitpost was submitted to SRS and sincerely want to discuss it, visit SRSDiscussion.

That is not the problem. The problem is on acquiring the gold in the first place. One does not readily adopt a medium of exchange when suffering a 7% loss off the bat. Many prefer to skirt the law in this area.

&gt;Capital gains... well, I guess. A business will get capital gains from money too. They'll put it in the bank at the end of each week or whatever and start earning interest. Gold appreciates just by sitting there, but is this really a fundamentally different problem?

A business will get interest from gold-denominated time deposits, too. The issue is capital gains on gold resulting from the dollar hypothetically falling against it. This problem does not plague dollars.

&gt;How could it work otherwise? Suppose I have a debt to you. Isn't it a good thing that form of payment is set by fiat? I mean, what if you decide that you want payment in something that I can't easily obtain or transport? What if I want to pay in gold you want something else.

It is simply that Paul and others would like to see two parties enter into a legally enforceable contract where a weight of gold is required for payment. You see this in international capital markets all the time with different currencies. For example, bonds under international law may demand payment in Euro, not Greek Drachma. Banks in Hungary may demand payment in CHF. 

To answer your question, there is no force, it just expands options. Makes it legal for two people to agree to something.","1335831378"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Mata's the creative force and has been crucial to many Chelsea build-ups over the season. He may not score as much as Lampard, but with proper support on the wings, the goals will come. Moving Ramires back into the middle will also provide more engine support.

Torres has been good for months, the confidence and support in the build-up has been present for months, now he's getting more luck and more goals. Lukaku was supposed to go out on loan this year but couldn't, he will next year almost assuredly so. He's been handed a few caps for Belgium so it's not just potential.

So long as the system is strong, the strength of the individual players is not that important. Cahill has formed a strong partnership with Terry and in a few years, him and Luiz can compliment each other very well. Jeffrey Bruma has also done well for Hamburg this season.

Yep, they have a few good years left. Drogba scores consistently in the big games, after RDM took over Lampard has been playing out of his boots and supplying many fantastic balls, and JT has played on very well despite playing through broken ribs. Bring in the supporting cast that can perform week in, week out, and yeah we should be back to challenging for the EPL title next season.","1335831385"

At the same time GB would buy/take resources like cotton that they couldn't reliably produce there. It helped to keep the colonials reliant on Britain, and Britain got all the money for selling the finished products.

I think Jon is a generally good guy. I've watched his show for years and watched as his personal opinions have changed on issues (with the show following his lead in many cases) and think he's a generally reasonable guy who's enough of a star to earn some creative independence on his show. He's also a dad and he works in the entertainment industry (not the news industry, the policial commentator business or any other such career). As such, his story choices tend to be dictated by what people will be willing to watch. He wouldn't have a job for too much longer if his show turned into a series of editorials on contentious issues -- that's called bad comedy.

Feel free to call this cowardice if you will, but I just don't think that Jon just wants to be a private indivdual right now. He's got young kids and doesn't seem interested in being the kind of crusading personality Stephen Colbert puts on occasionally. He plugs away at his main focus (the idiocy of the news media) and keeps his head down. To me, this is less evidence of him being controlled or manipulated and more him making the choices he thinks will be best for him and his family. Yeah, it isn't brave. But, I don't think it's cowardly.","1335831401"

"programming","t5_2fwo","This is something I've been thinking about. What if we were to use some kind of database for storing source code. Ie, one record for each function, with columns for storing metadata. When you want to edit some code you indicate what data structures/functions you are interested in and the editor comes up with a presentation of those, most likely a simple list like what we have now.

This way when you edit a function the database already knows how all these entities are related and can quickly recompile only touched portions. Multiple versions of compiled code could exist. Bytecode for quick compiles and debugging, optimized versions for shipping, profiled versions for optimizing and the database would keep all these straight.

There would be no file system clutter because it would all be stored in the db at the project root. Editor support would improve because it can just query the database for metadata about the code instead of trying to parse the code directly. 

None of this is that difficult to implement. It just requires a culture change to store code in some kind of db instead of a serial format like text files.

If you're using a remote with XBMC today, you're probably using EventGhost to do the dirty work.  EventGhost is a great program, although it occasionally forgets its programming and has a problem releasing auto-repeat presses (if you hold down a remote button for more than about 2 seconds, it will never stop scrolling).  It's also one more program you're running all the time on a machine that should be devoted to running your XBMC installation.

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","My hallucinations are generally auditory based, but I do get a good number of tactile ones. I'm not sure if what you are experiencing when closing your eyes are hallucination related. Have you talked to your doctor about what you are experiencing?

In terms of prognosis and how things progressed I think everyone is different. I've gradually gotten worse over time. In early stages I had a lot of detachment and flat affect, with intermittant rapid-cycling between all sorts of moods and emotions, but as I've gotten older my mood have stabilized to be generally depressive, with short manic/hypomanic episodes and bad depressive episodes. I'm 27, and was diagnosed at 18 after a suicide attempt. Part of why I may have slipped is that there was a two year gap in there where I didn't undergo any treatment, my first psychiatrist and I didn't really click and he kept me on Seroquel when it severely sedated me (I was on 600mg at the end, and to give an idea as to how severely I'm affected by it, if I now take a 50mg pill I'll be asleep in 45 minutes --- it's the only medication I've ever really strongly reacted to negatively). Now I have an awesome psychiatrist, though he's in another city (recent move, haven't found a local one).

You should talk to your psych about what you're going through and your concerns about prognosis.

For every Warren Buffett or Stephen King out there, people who are richer than Croesus, there are literally thousands of people who are going to be hit *even harder* by an increased rate because of pass-through income on small businesses.  They won't be getting hit harder because they're cheaters, or because they're particularly rich, but precisely because they're neither.  If they were either, they could take advantage of a myriad of loopholes and exemptions that are in our current tax code.  

None of these hugely rich assholes calling for higher taxes need even be affected by them.  If the raised the capital gains tax to 50% and top marginal rates to 70% tomorrow, neither Buffett, King, or Romney for that matter, would necessarily pay a dime in federal income tax at the end of the year.  They don't have to realize capital gains.  They don't have to show an income to pay the bills.  On the other hand, tens of thousands of small business owners retaining earnings in order to put product on the shelf in an inflationary market would most definitely see the hit.

You want to make guys like this contribute, hit them where you won't hurt the small business owners:  their assets.  Otherwise, you're just giving more weight to an advantage that the rich already have over the rest of us:  tax avoidance strategies.","1335831416"

"compsci","t5_2qhmr","I have a PhD in bioinformatics from Stanford.

The short answer: study whatever you want. (Figure out what you really love, and study it, hard)

The long answer: it depends.

There are no hard and fast rules about what things a bioinformatics degree must include.  There are a lot of databases, machine learning, AI, software and algs, and applied CS techniques to data.  There are also a requisite understanding of biology, genomics, and pharma/drug modeling and design.  I'd skip the low level arch and hardware stuff, never been useful, just audit some courses to get the feel.

That said, some people doing bioinformatics weigh heavily to either side of that combo.

Go look at the degree requirements for some on the top grad bioinformatics programs to get a sense of the coursework they cover and how the requirements are structured.

Most grad programs have insane filters, we would regularly see 300+ applicants for 5-10 slots.  First author publications in established journals were the primary differentiating factor for admissions around the time I left in 2002.  That or significant research experience or recs in well known labs.

As a student, you also have the ""golden in"", saying, ""I'm a student and would like to ask you some questions"".  Use it.  Call up people, schedule a phone interview or a face-toface informational interview of people doing what you want to do and ask them what they use day to day.  Almost everybody will respond to students showing authentic interest in their profession.

The wizard I'm a little worried that it will turn into a game of kiting while waiting for your magic thing to regen. But he has the coolest spells IMO.

The barb had the coolest armors and weapons and he is very destructive. But I'm worried about being melee late game and that the fighting style might get old for me, but I'm not sure...

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt; After our spring break we got back to school and he gave me his computer to use while he went to shower. So being the nosy person I am I checked his history, because I had been away for spring break. I found a picture of a barely clothed woman on there. I asked him when the last time he watched porn was and he told me that he watched it the Monday after I left. (I left on Saturday, and we had sex on Friday night). 

Step 1: Grow up. Invading someone's privacy is childish and immature.  Take a look at yourself, expecting someone to change their habits over someone that isn't even adult enough to *not* look through their personal things. You won't be in a successful relationship if you keep doing these things.


&gt; Since then we've been bickering over almost every little thing. We both start little fights with each other. I don't know what to do, is it worth fighting over? I've told him that I consider it to be cheating. So I've thought about hooking up with someone else so he knows what I feel. But I could never do that to him because I care about him too much. 

That's insane. Watching two people bang through a screen is COMPLETELY different than having sex with someone in real life.

"latin","t5_2qloa","My best advice:

**1. Memorisation** - 
It's good for your brain overall, and critical for Latin.  It takes too long to have to look up every ending all the time rather than just know that *-us* is going to be nominative singular for the second declension, but possibly plural for the fourth.

**2.  Read it aloud** - even if it feels like this is doing nothing, it's doing so much more than you think.  It will help your brain, even on a subconscious level, perceive rhythms and patterns that will help you interpret the meaning.

**3.  Find the verb** - I say this as a ""translation panicker"" myself, I start to fret if I can't make sense of the sentence from the first three words.  But often you can't.  You have to go through, and find the verb, and then deal with the relative clauses.  Some texts are punctuated more helpfully than others.  The most critical thing though is to *take that leap of faith* and just skip over the earlier words until you find the verb.","1335831424"

&gt; That news story is wildly inaccurate. 

It isn't nearly zero, I'll grant you.  It's 6.9%.

Let's explore a bit and see how that compares:

EU average: 10.2%

Ireland: 14.2%

Greece: 21% (look at that chart!)

Spain: 23.6%

Portugal: 15%

So you're right: it's not nearly zero; it's ""only"" materially less than the nations who have taken the other approaches.  And it's worth noting the directionality of the charts: Iceland is down, most everyone else is up (and many way, way, way up)

&gt;The Eu is going to come down on them like a ton of bricks over how they handled their banks going under...

And before you rush out to hire a therapist, see what you can do in your network of friends and family to help yourself out of your depression.

Most times, family and friends are more than willing to bend over backwards to help, if you show them you genuinely need their help. And those friends that don't / won't, well, they aren't good friends at all.

There are actually about four or five familiar kinds of ""brown"" that include red brown, orange brown, yellow brown and soft green brown (what most people would identify as sandstone) and additional ones that can include purple and blue shades (like taupe or umber). Brown is not really a color, its just color that has been desaturated or darkened enough to look different to the average individual.

"Etsy","t5_2qq24","Hey there... 

I think your shop is really cool. I am by no means an expert on either jewelry or fashion, so take my advice with a grain of salt... 

Your shop is comprised of two different types of items... your printed horror dresses and your jewelry. Here are my ideas: 

1) This might sound counter productive, but you should triple the cost of the eyeball and teeth bracelets. You hand paint each one? How long does it take you? Are you paying yourself $4 an hour? I would spend some money on higher-quality elastic. I think they'd sell well at $25, especially the teeth bracelet. 

... but

You need to work on your pictures. This will really help. The main picture of your teeth bracelet is washed out. Half the pictures of your dresses are a little blurry and are not color correct. 

Also, this might sound a little hypocritical coming from me, but I would rethink the photoshop method you use with your dresses. They're really, really cool, but I don't think the way you present them works. I would find some attractive, tatted up models and reshoot them all using the real dresses with real people. The way you have it now is a good idea, but I honestly don't think it's doing you any favors. 

Your 97% feedback isn't going to help you, either. They're all coming from the same item... your eyeball bracelet. I would look into why that is so. I would consider splitting your store, making the dresses into one store, the jewelry into another. I have 5 stores, and I find splitting them is actually better than keeping it together. 

Your tags could use a little work, like courtneyj suggests. Phrases work better than specific words. 

Again, you have really cool stuff. Good luck with it. ","1335831442"

All that Krugman has been saying, from what I've seen, is that we're not doing enough at the moment to spur the economy back into motion. Not that we should be spending like drunken sailors. Just like you wouldn't want to make your budget any tighter when you're going through a financial crisis, you don't want to be restricting yourself that much in making economic policies.

Essentially, Krugman's point is much like that of the ant's, in the [ant and the grasshopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper), while Paul advocates for the reckless path of the grasshopper in that parable, and doesn't believe in doing anything no matter whether it's good times or bad.

And as he said, Paul's insistence that the government can't do anything good in relation to the economy, and should step out of all economic policy making is so bullheadedly stupid, that it makes you question how much he even knows about how money works in the first place.","1335831447"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Please don't pretend that Kim and gang didn't know copyright violations were occurring on a massive scale on their site, and that they turned a very blind eye to it. It's the law and they broke it. 

The above statement implies: 1) There was massive scale copyright violations occurring on their site.  2) Kim and gang knew this but failed to do anything to stop it, thereby facilitating the commission of  criminal acts.  Hence, the conspiracy.  That is all that is needed for them to be guilty of conspiracy.  

Given the above alone, at **best** they were merely complicit in the crime.  However there is such overwhelming evidence against them that they not only were merely complicit but actively encouraged the criminal acts (by the rewards system as you have mentioned) then it only furthers the evidence necessary to convict of the crime.  

&gt; Megaupload were raided for a criminal conspiracy involving paying users to commit copyright infringement.

As I said above, paying users only reinforces the conspiracy charge.  However this isn't necessary to prove such a conspiracy existed.  All that is needed is for them to agree to commit a criminal act some time in the future (even if the act never occurs) for there to have been a conspiracy.  

Get it yet? 

Finally... Google, Yahoo, etc.  They are absolved of this because while they may know such acts are generally occurring they will act on specific instances when they are made known.  Also as hosting providers they are given some leeway from (I forget what law it is right now).  However this clearly isn't the case here.  Megaupload knew of very specific instances of copyright infringement and did nothing about it and they continued to provide the services.  That is sufficient for a  conspiracy.

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","I meant [girl gamer and LGBT] ally. On the blog. I had thought that might cause trouble, but I guess I didn't clean it up enough. Although, yes, you are correct that I just learned them all at once, but at the same time, they were all right from the same place. I also meant SRS as in Shitredditsays. They like neologisms like notpology. 

As for ze and hir, those are terrible words, terrible English, and shouldn't be used unless someone absolutely forces you to. Especially in this case, where you're using it for people who *aren't* genderqueer. The proper third person pronoun is the singular they, which, despite what some English professors will tell you, has been in use for a few hundred years now.

And I saw the link on hegemonic masculinity, but... eh. Why does something like this exist in the Fighting Game Community specifically, while it doesn't quite in the Starcraft community? Or even in such a way in the FPS community. I will say it wasn't terrible writing, which is as high as praise usually gets from me for blogs. It is the best discussion about the subject here that I've seen. I will say that I don't like that you keep saying ""we'll get to that in part four"". 

I also think that the video game community is one of the most accepting of transgender people. In a way the transphobia part you keep talking about seems a little unneeded. Not completely, but not on the levels you talked about with this. Poison is accepted as transgender, it's just that no one can agree on whether she's still got her penis or not. I mean, it's the fact that she's transgendered that makes her such a fan favorite, in a way. Sort of like Bridget, only, not as good as Bridget. Likewise, from what I hear, Scarlett has been getting a lot of support in the Starcraft community, unlike this incident here. I will admit that that's the part that I'm most interested in reading, though. 

Also, I feel that if someone finds themselves reliving trauma from reading something that they should stop reading it. ","1335831454"

I would say that a good example of what I'm talking about in relationship to what you're pointing out is the fact that the tea party was wholly and fully embraced by the Republican party.  And their organization wasn't grass roots it was aided and abetted by very wealthy Republican donors and astroturf organizations, as well as the Fox news media machine.

Compared to Occupy, which Democrats still keep at arms length, have hardly embraced at all with anything other than vaguely referential ideas, and which has had the benefit and assistance of no major funding or astroturf groups.......

That's basically what I'm saying.  With progressives, occupy affiliated or otherwise, the Democratic party wants the votes and they want the legwork and the support, but they also want to have their hands out to the same corporate groups which support the tea party and a pro business, anti worker agenda.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","If there really are no other catches then it sounds like an okay option right now, as a replacement for other fixed income investments. Insurance salesmen are bastards though, and I am highly skeptical that there are no hidden catches.

What I would compare it to would be CDs or I bonds, both of which also are guaranteed to not lose value. CDs return about 1-2.5% right now depending on term.  I bonds are ~3% and dropping to ~2.2% very soon. So 4% is pretty good. Obviously the 3% fee sucks, but it would only take about 2 years for it to be outpaced by the 4% interest -- when compared to hypothetical competing investment at 2%.

If interest rates go up, then the attractiveness of this will probably diminish. Yeah, sure, they offer ""at least 4%"", so you'd expect the rate to go up as prevailing interest rates go up, but insurance companies are notoriously stingy about that... not exactly a surprise when you're surrendering all control to them. What else would you expect? 

Personally I wouldn't bother. Vanguard Total Bond Market has generally returned 5-7% for the past 26 years.  Vanguard GNMA has returned around 5-9% for 32 years. No, they're not guaranteed against losing value; you will experience regular fluctuations in value; and they may perform worse in the future. But at least they're fairly transparent and aren't going through some filthy insurance middle man.

Also, I would never use this as a replacement for investing in stocks.","1335831465"

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","600dpi, 8ingame. I try to dabble with 400dpi to see if it can be more comfortable.  
  
What I'd recommend is to get a mouse with adjustable dpi like a G400. Download the software from logitech and manually set what the different dpi steps are. You can have up to 5 steps, so for example you set them to something like 400/600/800/1000/1200, the highest should be close to what you're using now. Use steps that aren't too big so that you just barely notice the different when you switch, then work your way down. As soon as your new dpi feels normal, go one step lower again.  
  
It'll help to have a mousepad big enough to do at least one full 360 with a little room to spare, i.e. if you do a 12""/360 you'd want at least a 14"" pad. Moving your mouse so much will feel really weird at first if you're used to high sens twitch aiming, but it really doesn't take long before it feels natural, a couple days at most using the method above.","1335831475"

"chemistry","t5_2qhf9","Well, I am about to do the experiments this summer, the small-scale purification process for tubulin and tau from brain has taken me a bit longer than I wanted.

What we really want to test for is to see if it helps Tau bind to microtubules. Sounds strange but Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein (no real structure) that seems to take on a folded state when bound to MTs. Molecules like TMAO are used by some animals to fold proteins in environments where they would usually be de-natured (like urea, for example). The molecule sort of acts like a bunch of hands that prevent the protein from unfolding in urea. It's quite interesting.

So who knows what we'll see. Hopefully something to that extent :)

Also missing is the 7.1 system that will hopefully hook up to those beasts in the back to one my my gfx cards. (they were a gift so if all else fails I'll buy a full 7.1 system.)

Monitors I am debating right now since i saw the [Toshiba 40"" 1080p 120Hz 40L5200U](http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2207827&amp;srkey=40L5200U) Which boasts a Gaming mode that has virtually no input lag. Bonus, they are 300$ cheaper.

Motherboard is also still up for debate, I've committed to I7-E and this motherboard has 6 Sata 6 and 4 Sata 4's + no Marvel Raid huge bonus and thank you to whomever mentioned that to me about the other mobo I had picked, but it's also out of stock everywhere  :/  I'm wondering if they may be coming out with a new one but that makes no sense even with Ivy out unless they are making an SB-E/IB-E hybrid.

I'm hoping it will be back in stock by the time I have the money put aside for it.

Estimated date of PC completion, July unless some extra money falls from the sky (My evil voice is saying skip on mortgage payments but I've learned to ignore it.) Monitor/Audio setup may be pushed to Mid November/End of December; Mortgage be expensive... -_-

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Salaam alaikum, 

You have received some answers which have hinted at the political nature of the marriage. Indeed there is truth to that aspect as Abu Bakar As-sadiq (the friend) became the father in law of the Prophet and the two became family literally. 

However, you are missing the main point the marriage between husband and wife. If you look at some of the hadith regarding the marriage it becomes apparent of the emotional bond shared between Aisha and the Prophet. They loved each other. The Prophet would drink from the same part of the cup where she drank from, they would race with camels, and when he passed away he did so while resting his head on her lap. I encourage you to study this marriage, within it is the most excellent example for spouses and how to treat one another. 

As for your concerns, we can address them in a basic manner. Essentially that which is wrong with pedophilia is the fact that one party does not have the ability to consent nor is there body physically ready for intercourse. From these two facts the practice itself is morally wrong and rightly so. 

Then it becomes our job to see if this applies to Aisha, of course it doesn't but we'll explore that hypothetical. 

You have already been told, I am sure, that it was a custom of the people at their time and I am sure you might have dismissed that as a flimsy rebutall. However, it is essential. Mental maturity is often dictated by society and the environment in which it grows. Obviously a person living in Arabia 1400 years ago would have to grow much faster than a person of he same age today. Aisha was raised in a society where she was expected to marry early and her parents raised her with that fact in mind. In fact there is a hadith where she refers to herself, at the time of the marriage, not as a child but as a *women*. At this point in time people of her age were expected to marry and she expected nothing else and had been raised and equipped for the responsibilities that entail marriage. 

Physically she had already had her menarche and was post-pubescent. Her body was able to support a child and thus she was also physically able to marry and fulfill her duties as a spouse and in turn have her rights fulfilled. 

It is important to consider the requirements such as the consent from both parties as well as the hadith which states that there must come no harm from marriage that would void any marriage that would take advantage of children for example, in history or in the modern world. 

Today we view marriage with a nine year old as immoral, and rightly so, as children now take much longer to mature. 15 year olds are still treated as children whereas 1400 years ago they were leading Islamic expeditions against various enemies of Islam. A person of 20 is seen as too young to marry and financially unable. These conditions and biases of our own culture tend to color and misapply these conditions as constants in the far past but they are not historical constants. That would be silly and nonsensical. Indeed this is the first step anthropologists take when studying ancient culture, distancing themselves with their own cultural biases. Indeed we would be condemning not only this incident but very very likely our own ancestors from which we came into being, as it was this custom that allowed our forefathers to cope with a world as harsh and turbulent as theirs was. 

It is sad to see people trying to speak for Aisha as if she was a child when she said, in no uncertain terms, that she didn't consider herself a child nor did she see find anything wrong with the marriage. Indeed the fact that this question eclipses the love that both the Prophet and Aisha had for each other is a very sad thing indeed, we would do well to learn from it. As well as learn from Aisha when she spoke of her husband and the type of person he was in family matters and matters of the Muslim community at large. This marriage is essential to understanding Islam but it is contorted to turn such a indispensable tool against its own people. ","1335831483"

[Here](http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/articles/what-we-believe-about-the-five-points-of-calvinism#Depravity) is an article that ties together the concept of total depravity in the arc of redemptive history supporting it with biblical evidence.

Romans 5:12-14 states, ""Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.""

We can see that ""sin is not counted where there is no law. **Yet** death reigned from Adam to Moses..."" Thus Adam's sin was imputed to each successive person and made them depraved.

Romans 7:7-12 talks about how the law *draws sin out of sinners.* It makes them more sinful because of their totally rebellious nature. Just out of sinful spite if God says, ""Don't do X,"" we immediately want to do X.

We don't actually require closures on our shirts either. Your bodice will pretty much hold it in place. If you went with a button at the collar as a peasant you'd want wood or bone. Lacing up a chemise seems silly to me, I'm not aware of any actual examples of that being done (but I only do highland, we're a poor and backwards people in the Renaissance.)

A quick look at French Medieval and Renaissance portraits suggests to me a preference for low neck lines, with the chemise rarely visible above the bodice, which I think your first link also supports. The chemise follows the neck line which seems to be fairly low. It looks like there was nothing to open, she just lifted her breast out of the dress. I don't know that you should be terribly concerned with the nursing aspect of it though, because there were maternity clothes back then. That's probably a looser fitting dress. If you're going to be laced in that's a different matter entirely.

I totally agree you need studies to support the argument of a wage gap between genders(and even then, studies are up for interpretation), but you also need studies to support the claim that the two genders are paid the same for all jobs. You haven't provided any studies, so while it would be foolish to buy into the idea of a wage gap without further investigating, it would be equally foolish to say there 100% of the time, pay between genders in a given job is equal . You can say you don't buy into the wage gap idea today, but saying 100% there isn't one is overstating the evidence we have.(or at least the evidence I've seen)

Edit-Also, a wage gap doesn't have to refer just to men and women getting paid differently for the same job. If there's a pattern of women taking lower paying jobs in a society across the board, that can be called a wage gap. If there is a trend of women taking lower paying job, it defines the role women take in a society. 

That 2nd type of wage gap is arguably less of a concern, as women who do break into higher paying fields can make equal money as their male co-workers. I'd argue a trend of one gender being pushed towards lower paying jobs is a negative thing, but again, that's easily argued and depends on perspective. But it's still a gap in the overall wages a given gender makes, which when it's happening on a large scale it suggests something else beyond personal choice at play.

"GetMotivated","t5_2rmfx","I was a financial advisor for 5 years and just recently left. Ive always been good with money myself but most of it came as a result of my own hardwork starting at a young age.

The tactic I respected most while I was working at the bank was when a father brought his little boy in. In most cases, especially these days, parents baby their kids through the process and most other big decisions in life. As a result of this conditioning, I turn to the Dad and ask him what brought them in. He said his son would like to open an account and they were not quite sure what would be the best option would be.

He was no more than 10-11, so the same age as your son, so I ran through all the options for minors in terms of bank accounts, savings accounts etc etc. I look at the man sitting across for me expectantly looking for an answer.

He looks to his son and says ""what do you think, how do you want to do this?"" The little boy looked at me, shy at first but then started asking questions about how things worked with debit cards and saving etc.

I was blown away that this little man was responsible for his own decision and that he was really thinking about how his choice was going to impact him. That fundamental lesson alone will save him from 90% of the financial trouble that most people face daily. 

In summary, teach them how to earn money, teach them the value of a dollar, teach them how to save and teach them that debt is the devil. As a final note, please please dont buy them cars for their 16th birthdays. ","1335831495"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Definitely changed from Engineer and Warrior to Necromancer and Elementalist for my two main classes, and Engineer when I get bored of those.

They sort of limited the skill system of Guild Wars 2 compared to 1 by not allowing skills to be swapped out or anything, so having 4 sets of skills with Elementalist per weapon makes up for that a bit. As well as having the Lightning Hammer (rock on!) and (although I haven't been able to use it) the Fiery Greatsword.

Necromancer has a lot more divers 6-0 skills than other classes, pretty enjoyable to mix it up.

Engineer played out like I thought it would, but Elementalist and Necromancer played out a lot better than I thought they would.

I do have to say thought that I don't think all the hype was warranted... I didn't have very much fun playing most classes, while I did have a lot of fun playing most classes in the original Guild Wars.","1335831509"

You mean like Austrians on the internet. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

&gt;Let's say it's as stupid as homeopathy.

I don't accept your analogy. It isn't like homeopathy. It is more like Freudian Psychology. 

&gt;It's still good to give a good critique to why it is bullshit.

Maybe many years ago, but the point here is we rejected this non-sense a long time ago, and re-engaging it only gives it legitimacy it does not deserve. You act as if this were somehow a new thing, it isn't. 

&gt;I would LOVE to see them going into a debate with a leading scientist in the field of medicine and biomedical science, especially if over 50.000 would go to a good cause. 

This would only give homeopathy legitimacy as an alternate to modern medicine. It would do nothing else. More importantly, medical doctrine **IS NOT*** decided by grandstanding debates. You should be very thankful for that fact, because if it were, you'd likely never been born. 

&gt;And they donate the money because they are convinced that their theory is sound, and want to prove that by putting a price on it. It's a bit childish to dismiss giving money to a good cause.

I didn't in any way dismiss it. Read what I said. They should just donate money regardless of whether there is a debate or not. Tying charity to the debate only cheapens the debate and the charity. 

&gt;hey reject it only for economics, not for physics. They say you can't use those methods for economics, but rather that you should use Praxeology.

There are no special exception fields of human knowledge in relation to science. It either works on all of them, or you reject it. You won't always have the ability to test what you want when you want to, but it works none the less. Just because something is hard, say doing scientific macro-level work in economics, does not mean you throw your methodology out the window for nonsensical ideological axioms. 

&gt;still think that every theory should be accepted or refuted, not ignored.

This one was refuted long ago. It is dead. It died. Give it up and move on.

&gt;austrain economists effectively predicted a couple of major crisises

So did a lot of people. There other issue with this idea is that Austrians preach doom all the fucking time. They were bound to be right occasionally, and in truth, they were only right in the most general way possible (which is to say not in a useful way). There was a bubble, it burst, go figure.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","Well, if you ripped off the band-aid, you were pretty quick to put a new one on. 

OP, what's happened here is a pretty typical continuation of a dysfunctional relationship. It's highly likely both of you have certain insecurities, and are co-dependent on each other to support yourselves in the face of them. The circumstances around the quarreling prior to you ""breaking up"" aren't clear, but the fighting was likely fueled by your respective insecurities. 

Neither of you want to give up your co-dependent support, so you continue to stick with each other, your respective warm blankies. 

All this is going to do is repeatedly hurt you as it devolves into successive cycles of dysfunctional mess: happy together - fighting together - breaking up together, followed by ... happy together - fighting together ... you get the idea. You are now entering the ""fighting together"" stage once more as your feelings get hurt again.

A break up is a breakup. Why are you continuing to hang on to him? He's not your bf. He owes you nothing. He gets to date whoever he wants. If you are going to allow him all the emotional comforts of home at the same time, he may be the lesser for taking them, but aren't you in control of your own self? 

Make the hard decisions you are suppose to make. You'll get over the resulting hurt eventually, and life will be better. It won't this way.","1335831515"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Like I said, i was the exact same way, i was an atheist until i was 19 years old. I was just another atheist who put everything under the same category just like you are doing right now. That is just a matter of fact. Fact is also that it needed to be more then just a book for me to believe in God, it HAD to be personal, if there truly is a God that exists i don't care who it is, i would rather him be personal than anything else, and that is what Jesus established and no other ""religion"" for the sake of argument did that. 

And for what ever reason you don't like the story of how he came to be. Big deal. Do you want God to take a holy shit and Jesus ShAZAAAM just came to be. What in the world is wrong with a virgin becoming pregnant by the holy spirit, if there would be a silly story this one would be that last i could think of. 

If you can see a pattern with Jesus, everything he ever did was to humble himself. The reason why he was born in Nazareth was because it was the last place anything good would come from back then. Its the equivalent of New Jersey today, joking but seriously. People then even said nothing good would come out of Nazareth. 

And yes you are not alone with your story of how ridicules it all sounds. You sound like somebody who read the New Testament, do you remember the part where Jesus started talking about how he is the flesh and the blood and how they will have to drink his blood and etc. Even back then there was a little ErgoDisaster saying well F that i am out of here and left. Some of his Disciples even left him saying, this is a hard teaching who can follow it. But the only conclusion they would come to is, who else offers eternal life. 

Also I think you completely missed the point of why Jesus was on earth. He didn't come to ""fix"" this world, he came to save us and offer us eternal life, not by going to church, praying everyday or all those daily rituals. Just by simply believing in him. That is it! Teach about germ theory and electricity are so far and beyond the subject. I mean it would have no relevance, not so ever in an eternal perspective. 

And no you cannot make this generalizations about it not being a relationship, because we wanna mask to protect that all religion are doing the same thing. What you are saying sounds like a collaborate scheme. Dude we are just people, believe what you want. I am not sitting at home passionately rejecting other religions i couldn't care less.
You are talking to me now. I know it will hard if not impossible for you to just put me in another category. For me you are just another atheist who rejects everything for the same reason. But i can tell you many people have come to know Jesus, intelligent people, rational people who have had just as crazy reasons. And they are ALL valid reason! 

If you think about it real hard, why wouldn't I reject other religion if I think that Jesus is the only way, i would be lying to myself and lying to you by saying, oh yeah i love Jesus he is the only way bla bla bla but please do go ahead and try the Muslim faith. I mean common, I will rather remain consistent. Not the next guy you are talking to about faith, cause i can tell you he will be different again. But you of course you will judge him too, because he says that i am wrong and he is right. I mean for goodness sake you should be glad he is saying that. Just because you don't like that, Christians ought to learn from that and change, become inconsistent, suddenly have an open mind about who is going to hell and who is not? If you ever come across somebody who is lukewarm don't bother getting anything out of him. The sad thing is, that inconsistency is what drove me away. because i was like well screw that they don't even know right from wrong and cant agree on anything. The only example i can think of again, is that an alien would judge humanity based on one sample. It really doesn't even matter category you think off, once you belong to a certain group, you will follow with passion, whether its a sport steam, your company, or Nazis. You will follow. However nowadays we have so many options to follow lots of crap. I really don't think that anybody will follow anything blindly anymore unless you are a sect of some sort. Like God hates fags.com, i mean these folks have got some serious issues. I don't think we differ that much. We are just on opposite sites on the spectrum thats it. 

Consistency is actually the one reason why i love Ron Paul so much hehe. (Not because of his faith)

Find a few good conversation topics you can whip out when you need to and ask a lot of questions and follow up questions.  Works as a reasonable facsimile for social skills.  Or if you want, just wait to talk til you feel like it.  There's no rule to say you have to carry the conversation.

Your machine has several things that basically handle computations that allow graphics/physics/other stuff to be rendered and then 'sent' to your television.

I think the max number of football scholarships at the FCS level is 35 while at the BCS level it is 85. So there are potentially 50 male athletes of other sports who no longer would have scholarships, or an extra 50 women's scholarships that would have to be funded.

Why should the fact that they have a different understanding of the world make the wrong? Because their understanding is wrong. If I told you I didn't believe in gravity, I would be wrong no matter what I asserted, no matter what my religious belief.

I have to question your understanding of evolution. Most creationists or people who claim that evolution isn't true say things the clearly show they don't understand it, ie ""We didn't evolve from monkeys!"". Evolution does not say that we evolved from monkeys, and it shows their lack of understanding.

""Nothing can be proven"". You're right. Gravity can't be proven to be true, and I can't use F=Gmm/r^2 to accurately predicte the force of attraction between two masses.

This needs repetition. If you don't accept evolution, it is because you do not understand it, or have been taught that it says ""humans evolved from monkeys"".

Now to eat it.  Add spinach and have salad; put on parchment paper, put cheese on top and throw in the microwave, toaster oven or oven and eat wrapped in romaine leaves... like a tuna melt (yum!)... do whatever.  It's fun.  This makes 2 - 3 meals depending on how I eat it.","1335831558"

I found NGB to be the spammy type. *ding ding ding ding ding*slash slash*ding ding ding ding*slash combo slash*ding ding ding ding* which ends up being harder (for me). There were also a lot of cheap tactics involved. Death was also a major thing to consider for me in NGB.

Dark Souls is a lot slower. The penalty for dying is minimal if you aren't unnecessarily cocky. You lose the world's currency which you use to level up and buy things when you die. You collect it as you go, say a zombie is 100 souls and you kill 10 now you have 1000 souls. If you die there will be a light above your body. Should you make it back to your body without dying you can pick the souls back up. If you die before picking it up then those souls disappear forever. If you spend them as you get them its even less of a problem.

Another thing is that you ""rest"" at bonfires and your health potions refil if the bonfire is lit. All enemies reset as well but you get your potions. Towards the end of the game if you play your cards right you have 15 very potent potions. Also, if you know where the bonfires on many times you can just run through annoying parts.

Dark Souls hardness is also due to a near complete lack of explanation on how it works or what you are doing. Once you beat the game and know what is what unless you do an NG+ the normal game is pretty fun and fast paced. Dare I say almost...easy?","1335831561"

"MLPvectors","t5_2stxe","Great job!  [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/cu6Rc.jpg) of some things I spotted:

* There are a couple of fill issues that I marked with ""fill"" (there's also one on the lower brim of her headdress that I didn't mark and one on the top of her headdress that I didn't label before uploading the pic).  Try to make sure your fills are completely overlapped by your strokes.
* The eyebrows should start at a point towards the bottom along the edge of the eye and become thicker towards the top.  The main eyebrow should be one stroke and each individual eyelash should be a separate shape.  This makes the vector look a lot cleaner.
* It's very very hard to get eyes to look right by just adjusting paths.  Try using a clip mask to get the eye accents to fit to the retina, and to get both the retina and pupil to fit to the eyeball shape.  [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgsYIhBbJtg) is an excellent tutorial by OrangeL.  I would also recommend watching his other tutorials in the sidebar and taking a look at the [tutorials folder in the MLP-VectorClub DeviantArt gallery](http://mlp-vectorclub.deviantart.com/gallery/34905690) if you haven't already.  Also, both sets of eye accents (left and right) should have the same colors.
* There are a couple of areas where the stroke is either not completely overlapping or where it is sticking through the overlapping stroke.  Try to make sure that your strokes [overlap completely](http://i.imgur.com/Wn38w.png).
* Her mouth should be the thickest towards her face stroke (right now it looks thickest in the middle)
* Her bottom ear stroke should fully cover her mane stroke and should end either above or on the stroke.  Also, her ear looks a little strange in general.  It looks like it should be a bit more curved on the back side.
* Your strokes seem very wobbly at some spots.  Try to use the fewest amount of anchor points as possible to avoid any bulges or creases (like in the back of her stroke) and try to make the edges of your strokes parallel.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/j9Gjp.png) is a good example.

Overall looking good!  The best thing to do to improve is to keep practicing (this especially helps with wobbly strokes).  I hope these pointers help you out, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask!","1335831561"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","Most philosophers are full of shit so it doesn't surprise me that Ayn Rand is full of crap too.

However, attacking her philosophy on the basis of what she did or didn't do is a pretty weak way to go bout things.  The proper thing to do would be to say A, B, and C are the things she asserts, which are false because of X, Y, and Z.  Its hardly relevant who she engaged with or didn't engage with and what journals she ignored.

Most philosophy journals seem to be filled with nonsense.  Didn't some physicist get a bunch of random text published in one of these serious peer-reviewed philosophy journals?  I think it would be a useless endeavor to search for meaning in philosophy journals.  If anything, the true philosophers of today are working as scientists (see Dan Dennet, Steven Pinker, etc.)  Sitting around wanking in your own mind seems like a waste of time when we now have so many tools and technologies to practically explore possible answers to our deepest questions.

Maybe philosophy was a legitimate pursuit for first rate minds in ancient times when tools to investigate the universe were primitive.  But today, with all the tools available, philosophy seems to me to be an outpost for people who can't hack it.  The best philosophers today seem to be people with hyphenated careers.  Neuroscientist-philosopher, computer scientist-philosopher, physicist-philosopher, etc.  And they publish in science journals I presume.","1335831565"

"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","Every season, it seems like there's a mid-major that people point to when making the case that deserving smaller schools are being wrongfully left out of the NCAA Tournament in favor of bigger schools with more name recognition. This past season, Drexel was the mid-major to rally around.

The Dragons ran up 27 wins in the regular season, came up just short on the bubble, then rattled off two more victories in the NIT before falling to Massachusetts. So what can we expect from Bruiser Flint's group in 2012-13? More of the same. ESPN Insider John Gasaway notes that Drexel should be back and making noise in the Colonial Athletic Association yet again. He points out that they'll not only be returning a lot of experienced players from the season that just ended, but that the guys coming back generally play important roles in the team's success. If all goes according to plan, the Dragons -- along with fellow CAA contender Virginia Commonwealth -- could be on the committee's radar again next March. - - Luke Lapinski

""The Dragons were just as good as Virginia Commonwealth in CAA play, and Bruiser Flint loses just one key contributor from that team (Samme Givens). Damion Lee had an outstanding freshman year for the Dragons (he was named CAA Rookie of the Year), and typically players make a big leap in performance between their first and second seasons. Frantz Massenat is an excellent point guard who also happened to shoot 45 percent from beyond the arc. You heard it here first: Drexel and VCU should again battle for supremacy in the CAA."" - John Gesaway","1335831567"

That seems the most likely, since usually different countries and different states usually don't all make the same laws at the same time.  I think the answer for the pokemon centers could be explained by saying that maybe before battles were legalized, people were allowed to keep pokemon as pets.  So pokemon centers were developed in the same way we have veterinarians today, just this civilization is much more advanced than ours in terms of technology.  Perhaps this also explains pokeballs, they were developed for easy transportation of pets, so that's why you can only buy pokeballs at first. It isn't till later in the game that great balls and ultra balls are developed and then sold, because untill then people didn't really catch the high level pokemon because they wouldn't be as easy to keep as pets, so there wasn't really a need for more efficient balls.","1335831568"

Your foot isn't just a rubber ball, I'm well aware of that. Our bodies are really complicated machines and if they snapped violently around like a rubber band in normal movements like jumping, we wouldn't have very much control. Our legs have to do tons of shit. If they were just simple springs, they wouldn't be very good for squatting 400 lbs. That doesn't mean that nothing in our body has elastic properties. 

Not only that, but the leg functioning as a rubber ball isn't the crux of the comparison. The basis of the analogy is that ONE is a rubber ball and ONE is assisted by something that is chemically fueled. (a rocket, in this case) If your sticking point is that legs aren't elastic, not only are you wrong, but it doesn't make me wrong one way or the other.","1335831571"

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Human-Powered Vehicle Challenge (East) took place this weekend in Grove City, PA.  For those of you not familiar, schools around the country (and the world!)  build human-powered vehicles capable of a variety of tasks. All vehicles are required to have rollover protection and safety belts (and [here's an example why](http://youtu.be/GCV1-45p0fY).  Additionally, there are penalties for vehicles without aerodynamic devices.  

There were three categories for scoring:  overall design (including at least one ""innovative feature""), mens and womens' drag races, and a 2 hour, 30 minute endurance event.  Each of these was weighted as follows to find an overall winner: 

Design: 40%

Speed (Men's): 15%

Speed (Women's): 15%

Endurance: 30%



**Overall, here were the results:**

1.  [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology - Carnot Cycle](http://i.imgur.com/MKaeW.jpg)
2.  [Missouri University of Science and Technology - Kronos](http://i.imgur.com/ACC5E)
3. [Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering - Seabagel](http://i.imgur.com/hi55t.jpg)
4.  [University of Toronto - Bluenose](http://i.imgur.com/KBRUr) (apparently they're going to try to break the world speed record, 87mph, with some further tuning of this)


**Our Vehicle**

Our vehicle, the [Wind Breaker](http://i.imgur.com/xRi6t.jpg), was a senior design project for the five male UCF Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering students shown in the photo above. The sixth is our competition-required female volunteer, another ME student at UCF.  Each of those top four teams from above are fully-funded student organizations, some with teams of 20 or more students.  

Our team finished 6th overall and we were VERY pleased.  After a rough start to the endurance event, we managed to scrape by into 10th place for that event.  The endurance event was on a hilly, tough course about 1.7 or 1.8 km long.  We completed 22 laps in the 2 hours, 30 minutes (at least 3 must be done with each rider, including a female).  Kronos and Seabagel completed the most laps, with 32.  

This was UCF's first two-wheeled design in five years.   [Last year's trike](http://i.imgur.com/6eOCi) took third place overall, so we wanted to innovate *and* improve, especially since our Lockheed-Martin contact could not assist with the project this year.  We made a lightweight aluminum (7005) frame, but had a heavy fairing including a carbon fiber, kevlar, and fiberglass rollcage, with a nomex supporting ring.  Here is a picture [with the hatch and kick-out doors attached](http://i.imgur.com/RcW80.jpg), and one [without the hatch](http://i.imgur.com/xhOSl).  We ran the endurance event without these detachable parts to reduce the risk of failure.

**So how did we do?**

Here was our performance (out of 32 teams)

Design Report: 7th

Female Speed: 7th

Male Speed: 4th

Endurance: 10th

**Overall: 6th place.**  Very happy with that outcome.


**What happens next?**
We did suffer one major failure, but luckily not to a critical part:  Our front mount snapped a weld and was bouncing around.  Had we had much more riding than what we did, it could have been ugly.  We also put a lot of scratches and a few cracks in our fairing.  No worries, battle scars.  

The good news is now we have an amazing recumbent frame to tool around on.  Sure, the side mounts are a little bit awkward, but this thing is insane.  I can't explain how smooth or comfortable or well-balanced it is… but it is amazing.  The low-speed stability is phenomenal.  And it's quick!  I'm especially proud of [the frame that we ended up with](http://i.imgur.com/yxiUt)…. because that was my part of the design!

Look familiar?  We worked with [Catrike](http://www.catrike.com/).  They were an AMAZING help, and if you haven't ever ridden one of their trikes, do it now.  You will want one.  This design is loosely based off of their former production bike, the Musashi.  We changed up a lot of things to make it better for our events - most notably the width of the steering.  The shape they used is strong and light, so we used the shape with our own dimensions.  It was custom fit to all six of our riders.

Ask me questions!  We didn't get timed for speed (sadly) but the fastest we clocked ourselves was 35 mph.  Odds are we exceeded that in other runs, as the rider pulled back after gaining a clear lead.  Also, you can see a huge difference in teams with a much larger budget/resources than we have.  Not including our frame, our budget was $5000, and our vehicle was built and painted in a garage, not in a purpose-built lab and paint booth.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let's take a look at your logical reasoning here:

1. You, a ""nice guy,"" put yourself out there - *six whole times* - only to be rejected in favour of ""big, dumb, jocks.""

2. The only *possible* explanation for this is that ALL girls are ""horrible, power-hungry succubi, bent on causing misery."" Rather than, oh, some girls are just shallow/immature and go for brawns over brains, or even - oh, you're just not that physically attractive in comparison to brawny jock types who spend 24/7 training for whatever sport they play. Or even, hey, maybe they sensed your Nice Guy Entitlement from a miiile away and did not want to get mixed up in any of that. No, it couldn't possibly be *you*.

I am not sure why so many guys seem to believe that their niceness entitles them to a girlfriend. You know what (generally) happens when a ""nice girl"" gets rejected in favour of some bitchy homecoming queen/head cheerleader type? She doesn't go around bitching about how much she hates all MEN; she wallows in bed and cries about how she's not good enough, not pretty enough, not popular enough, whatever. Either way, somehow, it is always the woman's fault.

I am not saying you are necessarily undesirable, or that there aren't some girls who DO fit the ""horrible, power-hungry succubi, bent on causing misery"" role. But to generalize the way you did from a few instances and to not even bother checking what you yourself might have turn to turn these ladies off - that is incredibly myopic thinking right there.","1335831575"

&gt;So you're saying that because ""you don't have to look good in front of others"" is an excuse to treat people like shit?

Cast context in the worse unimaginative light possible, then pretend as the judger you're better?  I'm not obligated or paid to treat you or anyone nicely, I do it out of freewill.  Where as MJ is expected.  They are fallacy statements, and are now ad hominem.  You are making up part of that toxity in the community, just sitting on the other side of the agenda-fence.

You're right, you aren't attacking people who want to learn.  You've attacked those who have already. I originally retorted to all these people with inferiority complexes.  When you joined in, you got lumped together.  Is that my problem? No, you chose your battle.

I don't care who you could of been, it's what you do and who you are.  I get the same responses when arguing with Bronze league-rs from Starcraft. (A whole other boat of WTFery) If you're going to make a statement such as ""I don't want to learn to be not-bad, just for the sake of being not-bad"", I'm going to be take that as ""you're bad"" and get pissed off.  This quote best describes how I react to pseudo-intelligent posts like that.

&gt;""Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'"" - Isaac Asimov

You compared me to a person with a shit attitude who is a vehement racist, and it's his obligation to piss off everyone intentionally.  Even IdrA attitude is no where near that, and hes considered one of the angriest people in e-sports.  You made a very offensive and derogatory comparison, which cultivated from your contrived opinion*  I can hear you loud and clear, that people with shit attitudes don't make it far in real sports.  However, nobody is acting like that in e-sports either.

So that they will be more likely to consider other, healthier options rather than giving in to those initial doubts.

Yes, ideas are copied, iterated upon, and morphed into something that is unique to a game. But when you put story, progression, and the feeling of achieving something together correctly, it can be great.

"ainbow","t5_2tcpq","It doesn't surprise me that medication by itself did not help you. Throwing SSRI's at a problem isn't a solution, and I've been through the same kind of thing and understand why you're reluctant to go back to mental health practitioners. And just saying ""go into therapy"" isn't very helpful either; there are tons of different kinds and it's hard to suss out which is which and what will help.

I would recommend, if you're insured, that you go and visit someone who does Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This model is designed to give you specific tools to use when you encounter a ""self-hating moment."" They will try to get to the bottom of *why* you are experiencing this, and then they will sit with you and show you how to derail that thought process and switch to one that is more beneficial for you. A lot of people don't like therapy because they feel like they just show up, talk about their problems, and leave. CBT will give you something that you can actually *do* when you encounter these feelings and thoughts in your everyday life.

I am a long-time major depression patient, and I have been through several different medication therapies and psychotherapies. CBT is the one thing that really changed how I see myself. Besides LSD, that really helped too, but I would never recommend that in passing.


EDIT: And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that there is *always* someone who is attracted to your body type and look. IMHO, nobody is unattractive outright.

By searching using the terms you have provided, a majority of the results that will be tabulated here will occur in both the male and female variations of the search term (i.e. papers targeting ""sexual dysfunction"" and ""sexual problems"" will appear in both the male and female searches). Many papers may also be tagged with ""male"" or ""female"" simply because both parties are involved in sex, and it could then be possible that the article, despite being tagged as ""male"" and ""female,"" focuses on female dysfunctions and their implications for male partners. Finally, an inordinate number of male articles here will likely be referring to pharmacological articles regarding erectile dysfunction, which I believe isn't what Maxxters was referring to in this post. She was referring to, generally, mental sexual health and normal, non-pathological dysfunctions.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","&gt;The Arabs are never going to be satisfied until we're gone. And even then, I don't think they'll be happy

While I partially agree with you, this mentality doesn't do anyone any good. Israel needs the two state solution because the longer it waits, the larger and larger the proportion of Arabs and Ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel will become. By doing nothing, the rest of the population will allow the destruction of Israel by demographic facts on the ground. Palestinians also should have the right to self-determination. If they get a state and continue to bomb Israelis, then the IDF will have every reason to bomb them back, and this time it won't be nation vs. occupied territory, it'll be nation vs. nation. Israel will still be the stronger (militarily and economically) of the two, and will be capable of protecting itself. I do favor Jerusalem belonging entirely to Israel. Not because of Zionist ideals, or religious ideology, but because the Arabs lost a fucking war. They didn't just lose it, but they got their asses kicked all over the place. Israel returned the Sinai for peace, and it should be (and was) willing to return the West Bank and Gaza for peace. But the Palestinians just want to turn the clock back to before the 1967 war and pretend like nothing ever happened. Sorry, hurts to lose, I know, but we're keeping East Jerusalem. Fuck off. Also, Fuck Syria. You guys decided to team up with Egypt and attack after years of your people using the high ground in the Golan to shoot at Israelis? Sweet, you should've kept in mind that you could've lost, and you did. We like our water and we like our nice vineyards. So you can fuck off too. I mean, in 2006, the UN Human Rights Commission was abolished, largely because of it's obsession with Israel. The Human Rights Council replaced it, but in its first year, all 9 of its ""World"" resolutions criticized only Israel. Israel is responsible for only .0002% of civilian battle deaths, but it is subject to UN inquiries into War Crimes, censure in human rights councils, and to three UN committees to investigate Israeli crimes against humanity. So I don't really give two shits about what the UN says. Giving Palestinians their nation is fair, but handing them back ALL of the land that Israel gained in a defensive war is ridiculous. No country would ever do that, no matter what international law says. You don't gain leverage when you lose a war you yourself declared. Tough beans.","1335831595"

My mom and I informed him he would be going to a mental health center that night, no other options. He decided he did not want to.

Cops come, decide they're not taking him because he cheered up for them and fooled them into thinking he's sane and sober. They leave, he escalates and locks himself in his room, we realize we'll have to take him in on our own. I inform him he can walk or I can drag him to the car. He chooses option B. I pick the lock and literally drag him out of bed. Cops return and this time *actually take him.*

Once at the center, got him involuntarily committed, which meant lawyers and all that jazz. He still doesn't get what the fuck he did and is utterly baffled as to why I've basically stopped talking to him.

I don't think fiber and/or the rigidity of your feces has anything to do with it. My only other thought is, maybe you're just not quite done pooping yet, you clench it off, and some stays stuck in there at the very end? Try sitting on the toilet for 5 minutes longer, see if you can squeeze out some more. See if that fixes the problem.

Either that, or it's 'rhoids or maybe a loose sphincter. By all means try the fiber, but don't fret about seeing a doctor should it not work. You'll live through the embarassment, I'm sure ;)","1335831602"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Your explanation is close to being right, but the negativity of the inside of the cell is separate from it attracting glutamate. You can think of glutamate and GABA binding seperately, one doesn't directly affect the other. 

So for example, you have a glutamate releasing neuron with an input from neurotransmitter X (could be glutamate, could be something else) that causes it to fire by depolarizing all the way down its processes called axons, releasing its stores of glutamate to act on something else. So we have three neurons in a chain 

neurotransmitter X -&gt; glutamate -&gt; neurotransmitter Y -&gt; -&gt; -&gt; some brain function

Neurotransmitter X releases glutamate which will excite the neuron releasing neurotransmitter Y, causing it to be released and work further downstream. Now, imagine a fourth neuron, a GABA neuron, that also interacts with the glutamate neuron, but instead of leading it to fire, it decreases its signal. Something like this.

neurotransmitter X -&gt; glutamate -&gt; neurotransmitter Y -&gt; -&gt; -&gt; some brain function

                       ^

                       |

                       GABA

Now, whatever set of inputs make GABA fire, will **decrease** activity in our first pathway. The pathways you can imagine are way, way, way more complicated than this, but each little sub-circuit has multiple inputs (excitatory and inhibitory) which they sum up, performing a little calculation almost in the process, that then go into outputs.

Finally, you're wondering about the electricity and depolarization, its across the plasma membrane. Positively and negatively charged ions are separate accross both sides by pumps, this creates a charge potential (i.e. a voltage in physics) that acts just like the charge separation in a battery or cappacitor. Ion channels open, releasing that charge (a current) that then alters that voltage. The change in voltage then is ""felt"" by ion channels down the neuron, and a signal is propagated. Its called an action potential, theres a very good read of it in [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Potential)

"argentina","t5_2qlht","Ojo, lo de ""consultá con un psicólogo y después con un psiquiatra"" va más por el lado de tomar estos síntomas de inapetencia como gestos fenoménicos de tu cuerpo en consonancia con tu 'existir' presente. La falta de inapetencia por el mundo es, en definitiva, la falta de inapetencia por la vida y sus cosas y por tu cuerpo. Esa es por lo menos mi razón (desde lo que se podría nomenclar como una postura fenomenológica - sociopsicoanalítica). 

Dicho de otro modo, que estos síntomas concretos (con un basamento y un mecanismo orgánico tan definido y tan simbólico para el cuerpo) son un ""bueno loco, ya fue, yo me subo al tren"" por parte tuyo en sentido fisiológico/neuronal, lo cual obviamente no quiere decir que sean originarios de ni efecto estricto, pero me suenan más contributivos a una ola de 'acomodamiento' integral de tu existencia en función de ese vacío, si bien son dos gotas que ya rebalsan un poco el vaso.

Desde un punto de vista cognitivo debería decirte ""bueno mirá, estás en una crisis existencial, tenés que empezar a reafirmar tu ego y a construir juicio positivo acerca tuyo a partir de los actos cotidianos""; la visión gestáltica me parece bastante buena en este sentido (ya que la mencionaron), va a contribuir a entender cómo estás involucrando exactamente ahora tu presente, cómo está definido a partir de qué parámetros y connotaciones emocionales. Obvio que esto no te va a hacer llenar el vacío, pero a lo mejor te abre un horizonte más allá del simple ""razonamiento"". Digo, desde mi punto de vista la razón puede volverse contra uno demasiado sutilmente.

""Physical castration appears to be highly effective as, historically, it results in a 20-year re-offense rate of less than 2.3% vs. 80% in the untreated control group, according to a large 1963 study involving a total of 1036 sex offenders by the German researcher A.

"SRSRecovery","t5_2tvbb","OP, I've got some thoughts on this one. Let's start with this passage:

&gt;In the case above, how does a person's perspective compete with the fact that ""niggardly"" does not mean anything perjorative against minorities? It is a fact that can be referenced from multiple sources.

Here's the problem: ""Niggardly"" went out of style a loooong time ago, and there's still the problem that in order to say ""niggardly,"" you have to say the first two syllables. *It's a problem.* (I'd suspect any number of closeted racists to use a word like niggardly to try and get a rise out of people.)

Here's why I highlighted the passage above: It's pretty tone-deaf. I'd have to ask why your friend used the word ""niggardly"" to begin with. Was there something wrong with ""miserly,"" ""penny-pinching"" or ""cheap""? Don't get me wrong; I love big words as much as the next writer, but when it comes to language, there's also the ground-zero reality of usage in the wild that we have to consider, too. 

**Or in other words, the discussion doesn't start and stop with sources you can cite.**

Dictionary definitions are a factor, to be sure, but language is also a churning free-for-all. For example, you wouldn't call a bundle of sticks a ""faggot"" and expect the usage to go unchallenged, would you? Yes, yes, yes -- niggardly is in a *slightly* grayer area, but there's still a discussion to be had there. 

Let's go back to what I see as the tone-deafness of the quoted passage above. There are ways you can actively listen while also validating the feelings of the people you're talking with. Here are some listening problems to avoid:

http://dictionary.sensagent.com/listening+problems/en-en/

In the case of the quoted passage above, it strikes me as a ""content-only response.""

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; It's certainly physical and it certainly contains a whole shitload of physical switches of one sort or other so how is it not a physical container?

Okay, I should speak more precisely, although my implication was clear. It's not a container in the way a garage is a container: the garage is designed to have physical things move in and out of it, whereas what the hard drive contains never changes. You don't take the physical switches out of the hard drive and put something else into it.

&gt; The matter is already in there. Why does this matter?

Because it's relevant to your garage analogy. You stated (correctly) that ownership of a garage does not imply ownership of other matter inside the garage. That's correct, since someone else can temporarily move their car into your garage without transferring ownership to you. However, that's not the case with a hard drive. When you transfer files to a hard drive, you're not replacing its content (physical switches) with different content.

&gt; That's not my point at all [that an MP3 is really more than its physical matter and energy].

Yes it is, if you believe both in traditional property rights (e.g. you own an unclaimed tree if you cut it down) and that copyright protection of digital audio is legitimate. The two beliefs are logically incompatible. To be logically consistent, you would have to believe either that copyright protection of digital audio is illegitimate, or that the axe-maker should have some authority over your tree since your interaction with the tree resulted partially from his effort.

&gt; Okay is this copy also the product of aggression if the copier had no right to make the copy?

No, I don't think so. The only reason the looter was in the wrong was because he violated his contract which governed his behavior with *the first copy he bought from the source*. The contract prohibited him from using his first copy to make additional copies, but there's no way it could have authority over subsequent interactions with third parties. If someone sells you a truck but you sign a contract saying you will stay within 10 miles, but then I hire you to haul grain for me 50 miles away, is that grain somehow ""the product of aggression,"" or do I still have complete property rights over the grain?","1335831635"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Meth is a horrible, horrible drug. Something that I know has worked for a few friends of mine when they confronted addicts who were their friends/family, is this: 

Create a list of all the things they do when they are using. Missing your birthday party would be one thing you can start with. And just keep this list, day by day (preferably on a calender even) for several weeks (meanwhile telling the parents and referring her to a counselor if you can). Also, not a bad idea to take some photos. 

At the end of the month or several weeks in, sit your friend down and show her your list. If she is really a good student, she will see the difference between what she was and what she has become. She may not even realize how far she's fallen until you show her and tell her. This, by the way, is only the beginning. If she wants to clean up her act, she has a long road ahead of her. 

Finally, I just want to say, I'm sorry you are in this situation, and I'm sorry that you may have lost your best friend. Meth is a terrible drug because it is so potent, so addictive, so dangerous (because you never know what went into making it, and its easy to overdose) and it will degrade her mentally and physically if she stays on it. Most unfortunately, however, is that if she wants to use it, short of committing her to some sort of in-house rehab that cuts her off from the world, there is nothing YOU can do to make her stop. That is a decision she has to make herself. 

Again, I'm sorry. ","1335831635"

If you want discussion don't start by ""air-quotes-ing"" the word ""christians"" to describe people who disagree with you.

.. It was never ok to start with.  But it 'became' *particularly* wrong when after earnestly and thoughtfully and prayerfully learning as much as I could about the bible and the times in which its books were written, I came to the belief that God does not disapprove of 'that lifestyle'.

If you wanna disagree with me about that, that's ok.  When you start by characterising me as an air-quotes christian and you as a real one, and suggesting that your approach is the bible approach while mine is... well you never say what you assume my faith is based on... old episodes of *'are you being served?'* quite possibly....

If spend all of your time talking about how you hate religion, trying to change people, bitching about how the world would be better without religion, you are acting more as an [antitheist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism). An atheist is just the lack of believe. The antitheists are the ones who are actively for anything.

Now I grant it, atheism usually comes along with certain things, like embracing science, pursuit of knowledge and all of that. These kinds of thinking styles are great and all but really they don't stem from being an atheist. Usually you are a deep thinker, or a scientist or something of that sort, and these thinking styles lead to you becoming an atheist, not the other way round.

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","If we take the ""African American"" idea and look to see if it occurs in other countries, we can see that it doesn't happen. In the UK we do not have people who refer to themselves or are referred to as ""African British"" unless they pretty much are both African and British (e.g. born in Africa, have British citizenship or have one or both of their parents being African). 

Many people who would refer to themselves or be referred to as ""Italian American"" or ""African American"", are simply British. 

I think that this stems from the US being a nation built off the backs of relatively recent immigrants, consensual or otherwise. This has given America a very strange sense of nationality, people aren't simply Americans, they're ""where their ancestors were from American"". Which can cause people to confuse nationality with race. 

""African American"" isn't the problem, the problem is the confusion of separate things, these being: Nationality, Race and Ancestry. If people whose great grandparents were Italian prefer to be referred to as ""Italian Americans"" then why shouldn't people whose great grandparents were African prefer ""African American""? 

But what do I know, I haven't grown up in America and Britain has nowhere near the size of Black population of the United States due to the relatively small amount of slaves brought here during the slave trade.

By being Christian, there's a BIG part of ""Jesus saved you, just accept the gift and all is good"".  That's just a fundamental part of Christianity.  It's as fundamental as believing God exists, Jesus was pretty cool, and Moses had an awesome beard.

Unfortunately, Evangelism believes in a ""Quantity over Quality"" approach, and massive shotgun conversion services throughout the years have created a less-informed Christian majority.  How many Christians do you know that actually read/analyze the Bible?  How many can tell the difference between the Apostle Paul and Saul of Tarsus (Hint: It's the same dude)?  How many ""twice a year Christians"" do you know?

Evangelism is directly incompatible with educated Christianity for the most part, unfortunately, as the two are diametrically opposed.  ""Convert the masses before they burn"" is actually, at its heart, a more noble (if shortsighted) endeavor when thinking from a strictly Fundamental Christian perspective.

We would all have to pile into the cars (there was 14 of us total) and drive to church and sit next to each other in the pews. They wanted us to take notes so they'd have us bring notebooks and pens. If you didn't sing during worship, you would get looked down upon. They encouraged everybody to go up and get prayed for every Sunday (because, you know, we needed it n' all), and they thought that it'd be best if we were all baptized. I never got baptized while I was there, I refused to do that, but I would stand during worship and sway in order to make it seem like I was trying. They enjoyed calling you out for nothing participating in church. We'd have to take part in grace at the meal after church and they would rotate who would be the one to lead grace (always a very awkward thing for me.) It wasn't enjoyable to go to church, other than being let out of the house, going out to eat and being able to order food that I actually wanted, and the prospects of MAYBE going to Walmart afterwards. Walmart was probably the most exciting place to shop at in the area at the time. Or Target. Thrilling, I know.","1335831647"

Upon getting my first job, they wanted me to pay around $600 a month. This was about 2 paychecks for me and extremely unacceptable. So now, 6 years into the loan, and a cosigner later, I'm down to about 9% with about a third of it gone. This company does not want to work with ANYONE, but when pressured, they seem to do something minimal. Pretty much had I known what I do today, I should have chosen to go to school or have a house.

On the other hand, my sister decided not to pay / forgot to pay, and according to her, 4 days later she had a garnishment. To which she quit her job and lived off of her significant other. To which they took most of her tax money from claiming kids.

#2 Mises was VERY hostile to using math in economics, yet wanted to only rely on deduction (which is very, very strange) so that wouldn't be in your interest.

Honestly, if you are doing finance, I would read a finance book. I know some people think finance and economics are the same, but they aren't. If anything, finance in a subset of economics (though I'm not sure this is right). Unfortunately, I do not know many good finance textbooks (not interested in that area of economics).

"wow","t5_2qio8","1. Yes, expertise is almost negligible for UH. You can ignore it completely.

3. It won't really hurt you, just as long as you can use it with the most amount of cooldowns active at once. That means predicting when hero is used and burn phases on bosses are. You aren't ""losing"" dps, just maybe losing out on a bit of potential later in the fight if you line up CDs badly.

4. I've heard that LTS is the worst epic trinket in the game (for my warrior, atleast) and I assume that's still true for DKs. Rotting skull works out to about 382 str on average, but it's short cooldown makes it very nice for certain fights (spine). Overall, I don't think it's worth the 1600 VP unless you literally only need to upgrade your trinket. The rosary is actually better than the other 378 trinket because crit has a higher stat weight, but if you don't need the hit from LtS just stack both the str 378 trinkets.

5. With simcraft you just have to remember that it's a computer. I can't comment on how accurate it is in particular for DKs, but just focus on minimizing downtime with runic corruption, and just getting the most out of your rotation. 

6. I can't really think of anything particular... I've had my pet bug out on madness and sit on a platform but that's unavoidable. 

Things to note: abuse the hell out of AMS every cooldown, and line it up so that you have near 0 RP when you activate it, and when it comes off cooldown have your pet's transformation almost over. This allows you to rapidly get your pet transformed again, and get 6+ seconds of runic corruption going by chaining 4-5 deathcoils.

Make sure you use D&amp;D off cooldown too, it does more damage than SS.

He uses something he calls antineoplaston combinations, which have not been vetted by the FDA because he uses them in ""clinical trials,"" for which he charges his ""test subjects"" a boatload of money. As a general rule, if someone wants you to give them 6 figures to participate in a clinical trial, they're full of crap.

You can ask the department representative it gives you your question, and start the process. Each college has their own policies on switching, but generally there's little difference if your target major is in the same one as your current major.  Sometimes your GPA can be lower but it really depends on your specific situation.  What's more of a problem is if you've been here for more than a couple of years, as there's a cap to the number of extra units you can take in order to graduate in the new major compared to the current one (usually 24).

I changed from Political Science to Computer Engineering and it really isn't as hard as it used to be.  All I had to do was take and pass a few classes in CPE.  Honestly the most frustrating part was probably attempting to register for those classes, but everyone feels that anyway.  Granted I started this my second quarter freshman year.

I was in a modestly similar situation whereby I was religious and attacked things that were contrary to my religion, but once I left home and was surrounded by people who accepted my beliefs and respectfully listened and debated with me.......all the religious stuff just sort of melted away and I took on what became my natural state of mind based on my personality and values - what I would have had without a strong birth place bias.

Not to be a downer or anything, it's cool you learned what you learned, but I wonder what this means in the larger scope of things in terms of changing people's minds.  I'd be interested to hear what other people have to say.","1335831682"

Short of finding that it is, sadly, probably over populated at this point and rather than trying to ween it government would be better off resetting expectations of quality of life, education, healthcare, etc,. because you could take every single government job out of Halifax and still not save CB. 

This is true for every place in the world. You have the ability to choose to live in the city and get certain things and you have the ability to live in the country and get certain things. You cannot get both! 

I think the real job here is to change the viewpoint of what it means to live in a rural place. Having the road paved up to your driveway and the garbage picked up there every week is not part of that. Neither are 24 hour emergency rooms and MRIs.

[Link](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/paul-ryans-budget-proposal-passes-house-democrats-medicare/story?id=13384520&amp;page=2#.T58sGydIiZY)

&gt;In a clever procedural move by Democrats, Republicans were forced into some somersaults when a more conservative budget than Ryan's was offered in a substitute amendment by Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J. Since only a simple majority is needed to pass a bill, most of the House Democrats voted ""present"" and thus brought down the magic number needed for passage. The trick almost helped the bill pass -- and would have embarrassed the GOP leadership in the process -- but after numerous Republicans switched their votes, the amendment failed 119-136, with 172 Democrats voting present.

The 2008 article, despite a sensationalist headline is advocating roughly the same thing Obama would do with a managed bankruptcy, although it is vague as to where the automakers would get the necessary capital during the financial meltdown.

&gt; I torrent pretty regularly, but I heard you can get in serious trouble for it at UCSB. I never use public trackers, mainly private trackers like what.cd. Can they still detect the use of private trackers like that and what would be the punishment. Also I heard the internet speeds are pretty fast, but that they throttle it at night. Is this true? How difficult is it to stream netflix or play xbox live at certain parts of the day?

From my observation, Resnet drops both torrent announce and data packets so you really cannot torrent directly from University owned housing. I use a https proxy on another machine for my torrent traffic. Seedboxes are also a viable option though in my opinion syncing files is a pain thus I prefer the proxy method. I can't speak regarding netflix or xbox live as I have no experience.

&gt; How often do y'all go into either LA or San Francisco? What's the travel time and how do you usually get down there.

Driving to San Francisco takes between 5-6 hours if there is no traffic. Even if there is, it usually isn't too bad. Driving to LA really depends on where you are going in LA.

&gt;There is no doubt that every social institution suffers from perversion of the original purpose to gain control over people, and that vigilance against such is strongly warranted.

In total sincerity, I would maintain the original purpose of the major world religions was to gain control over people. The mechanism through which this was accomplished is the mystical stuff which I discard entirely as rubbish and you seem to consider the actual meat of the thing.

Your second point contrasting the vibrancy of faith with the rigidity of institutional religion is fair, but again, historically it has never been problematic for religion to harness that nervous energy and direct it towards whatever end whoever is deemed to be closest to whatever version of the almighty you subscribe to chooses. Further, again, this isn't really a forum where you can cite:

&gt;the wildness and freedom of the religious experience

and expect to be taken entirely seriously. Unfortunately, there isn't really any way to convey 'I think you are deluded and taking your imaginary friend altogether too seriously, and really I have no interest in what it has to say or what strictures you feel I should abide by to satisfy it' without sounding rude, and yet it's an honest impression of my feeling towards it.

No, actually. I used to have severe social anxiety, in fact. To the point where I was damn near suicidal because of it.

No, actually, most people don't give a shit if you're somewhere on your own. The kind of people that do judge for that aren't the type you'd want to make friends with anyway, but they're in the minority. I've talked to plenty of people at bars or clubs that were there alone, and I've been to both on my own as well and come out with a friend or two as well.

"television","t5_2qh6e","Ah the only time I've seen the IP approach (I'm Canadian) is for when trying to access mobile TV through an iPad or Smart Phone. You need to be on Bell's towers to watch CTV tv shows. I don't even know if that qualifies as IP to be honest. 

Rogers offers RogersOnDemand which is basically Hulu but you can only access it when you're a Rogers customer. If you're on their IP you don't need to log in and if you're not on their IP you have to use your account number. This method makes the most sense to me, but I do think Hulu doing this is completely idiotic... Even though I can't access it as a Canadian anyway.

I think only allowing the product to be viewed when on their IP is completely idiotic because it reduces the value of the service. Anyway I didn't mean to sound harsh in my original comment, thanks for the real response.  ","1335831729"

He also sued his cousin after giving him his recipes and business model but not wanting him to expand in a market that JJ's wasn't operating in.  http://www.nndb.com/people/673/000205058/  

I have personal knowledge of him screwing over corporate managers for relatively small bonuses for things like rising food costs (when lettuce and tomatoes significantly rose but the allowance for good costs did not).  We're talking about guys who get paid 30K base to work 60-80 hours a week keeping a $1M+ annual sales store running at 30%+ profit.  With dozens of such corporate stores and hundreds of franchise stores, James Liataud would still make time to fuck with the general managers in the stores near his headquarters in Champaign.

Oh, and the sexual harassment complaints from female employees.  

And his threats to move his company to FL because he just can't handle the tax increase in Illinois.  Nevermind that a ~~vast majority~~ (great deal) of his money comes from college kids using government grants and subsidized loans to buy his food.  He succeeded IN SPITE of the oppressive gov't, not because of anything it provides.  The guy is the epitome of the feaux realization of the American Dream.  He is a first class scumbag that provides ample reasons to boycott his business, not just the hunting.

I'm not an insider, and the stuff about salaries and percentages are my best recollection of what managers told me a while back.  I feel like it is reliable, but I think the stories about screwing managers around for trivial reasons and relatively trivial amounts of money are the bigger deal.  Those are true.

"gamingpc","t5_2sq2y","I made [a fairly similar post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/comments/st71o/need_advice_on_a_new_monitor_setup_triple/) a few days ago (3x1 vs. 1 large for MMOs, etc). The big thing I got out of the responses is that, unless you have some particular game(s) in mind for the 3x1 thing, getting one large monitor is better. As for 120Hz, it may look nice, but unless you really need it (i.e. if you play a lot of CS or some other FPS) IMO you sacrifice too much to have it.

One other benefit of 2560x1440 over 5760x1980 is it's a lot less pixels to render (though it doesn't look like that would be a problem for you =P)

If you decide on a 27"", I suggest looking into the Korean panels out there (make sure you read up on them well, they carry certain risks).  I personally am currently deciding between one of them and a Dell u2711 (which hover around $850 on Amazon).

If you do want to go the 3x1 route, Dell has some new-ish 23"" and 24"" IPS monitors for $240 and $370, respectively. (these were also mentioned by itsPIXL).","1335831738"

I disagree that these should be classified as rape.  One of the perks of being an adult is the ability to say no even when people are pressuring you.  Ever been shopping for a car?  Salesmen put pressure on you to make the purchase, but people are able to say no.

"Firearms","t5_2ryez","This kind of touches on a conversation I had a week or so ago in another thread.  Even some of us gun owners are downright paranoid and act like we are terrified of firearms.  There is a difference in being careless and triple checking the magazine, chamber, and ammo to make damn sure the thing is empty.  There's a fine line in there that crosses from ""being safe and responsible"" and being downright paranoid and scared.  There is also a difference between being careless and being responsible.

Having said that and accepting the downvotes that will come, I think for taking ""casual"" photos, there really isn't a reason to have your finger on the trigger.  Posing in your casual photos to try to look like an Internet Badass and wanting to show your finger on the trigger is immature and irresponsible, and just plain unnecessary.

HOWEVER, in a professional type photo shoot sometimes the photographer wants to convey action, and when the shit hits the fan and your shooting the firearm, well then your damn finger is going to be on the trigger.

I know and respect, as well as practice, ""THE four rules"" of gun safety.  I've been shooting and handling firearms since before I was in school.  I was hunting with my father and older brothers then too.  Anytime I pick up a weapon, even in a gun store looking at display firearms, I always pull the action back and remove the magazine for inspection as soon as I pick it up.  I then triple check the firearm by cycling the action with the empty magazine removed and verify three times there is absolutely nothing in it.  If it's not a magazine fed weapon (ie a pump or bolt action) I always cycle the action (with the muzzle pointed in a safe direction, my finger off the trigger and the safety on, if it has a safety).  If it's loaded, this happens three times AFTER the last round is completely removed from the firearm.  Only after I have verified MYSELF there is nothing in the weapon does it then become cleared and ready for ""handling.""  At that point, and as long as it stays in my possession is it cleared.  If it changes hands, or I sit it down (example) and change my focus even for a split second to anything else, then it gets rechecked upon picking it back up.  If I hand a firearm to anyone else, I check it myself and hand it to them with the chamber open expecting them to then verify my check themselves.  Even then, though, I still never point the muzzle in an unsafe direction.  This was really drilled into my head during basic training.  The first time you hand any weapon to a drill sergeant without checking it yourself and leaving it unloaded and with an open chamber, you will never do that again.  I promise...

Back to your original question, sometimes it bothers me and sometimes it doesn't.  When it's obvious that it's not needed (the finger on the trigger), then I appreciate seeing the trigger safety.  But other times (ie youtube videos) when a person spends the first 45 seconds showing me it's ""safe,"" I sometimes just fast forward thinking, ""Seriously, just check the action so we can move on!""

Again, there's a thin line in there somewhere, and sometimes even us gun owners act like we are scared shitless it's ""just gonna go off.""  Unfortunately, the idiots that are irresponsible ruin it for all of us by making all gun owners stereotypically look/sound like idiots.  Seriously, it blows my mind how one can have a negligent discharge.  [THIS](http://youtu.be/nuR5A6IcUbg) just blows my mind, and this guy (in my personal opinion) should never be in any law enforcement, and I question whether or not he should ever legally be allowed to possess a firearm.

On an end note, what really cracks me up is the Internet Commandos that will bitch and moan about ""trigger safety"" and then in another thread talk about ""dry firing"" in their living room to break in the new trigger on their pistol.

ALSO, and final note (sorry, didn't intend to be so long winded):  Anytime I disassemble a firearm for cleaning, upon reassembly it gets three function checks to verify it's going to function again (just in case I missed a part).  According to some ""safety nazis"" I would have to take the firearm out to the range and aim it at a target before I can function check it.  Let's be real, I clean my weapons at home, and they get function checked by pointing the muzzle at the floor (on the first floor of course) and *shock* I pull the trigger.  But again, I've already triple checked it MYSELF and verified there is no ammo in it.","1335831741"

I'm pretty happy about finding the sharivari remixes, Younger than park double EP, and Reboot Sei es Drums Bailando records all for around $10 each since they fetch for well over $50 on discogs.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My brother-in-law and his girlfriend have not made the best decisions in life. They met when they were in GED classes together because they dropped out/failed high school. She was 16 and he was 18. Upon removing some spyware from my in-laws computer I found AIM chat logs of them talking to each other about trying to have a baby. Not the greatest idea at their age considering they are both living off of their parents, and in her case, her skeezy mom/the system.

Fast forward about 5 years and they broke up and got back together several times. She's pregnant and her 2 best friends in the world were murdered within those 5 years and she is extremely depressed. She, while pregnant, actually attacked the suspected killer's girlfriend (who had nothing to do with it) and was brought up on charges. 

She had her baby about a year and a half ago and aside from the depression everything seemed okay from the outside...

They were in an apartment together with her mom and my brother-in-law was working full time (and is also an alcoholic). She couldn't hold down a job and was pissed because the benefits they were getting from the system were running out, even though they used them to buy alcohol, cigs, video games, etc. instead of the proper food for them and their child. Every day she continued to post things about how bullshit her life is and how everything would be fine if her 2 friends were still alive. My in-laws family has reached out to them many times to help, but they reject or ignore any kind of money, side jobs, babysitting, etc.

A couple of weeks ago we all found out that when they want to go out and get drunk they leave their child in her crib (she's almost 2..she can climb), keep the 3rd floor door unlocked, and give a baby monitor to the people on the 2nd floor. REALLY? No common sense. None of us could fathom that. They have family who would love to babysit a quarter-mile away from their apartment, but they'd rather leave their child with strangers.

When we did babysit their child she was definitely lacking in hygiene so we bathe her every chance we get. They change her diaper maybe twice a day, and when they wash her bottles they don't remove the nipples to clean them. So when we had her for the night we took the bottle apart and there was a ton of mold in it. No wonder their kid is always sick!

My wife and mom, working in the public child care system are both required to report unfit parents and things like this, but neither of them have. My wife won't because she tries to give them the benefit of the doubt because it's her brother, and my mom won't out of respect for us and she doesn't feel it's her place. I feel like I would be betraying the whole family if I were to call and report them and I can't bring myself to do it. They really need some counciling, parenting classes, and a view of reality, but I feel that by reporting them it will only distance them further from us and we will see our niece even less.

**TLDR: 1 1/2 yr old niece is left alone by her parents with door unlocked when they want to go party, does not have good hygiene, and are distancing themselves from family. Nobody will call child services to get them help.**","1335831766"

"politics","t5_2cneq","(In my opinion) he doesn't have any arguments for any of the things he does. He simply goes by whatever the ""libertarian"" playbook says...unless it conflicts with his christian fundamentalism, then he tries to sneak that in there disguising it as state's rights (example being his stance on abortion, far from the libertarian view).

My biggest problem with him is that he doesn't even for a moment critically examine and consider the issues at all.. I mean seriously, destroying the epa under the guise that ""property rights"" will keep huge corporations from polluting is just irresponsible and demonstrates a huge inability to think critically. The man is fueled  by pure dogma, absolutely nothing of substance. So what if a few times it lands him on the better side of some issues, he didn't get to that side on purpose, it just happens to be what his dogma told him to do, in other instance the same ideology leads him to wanting to allow states to discriminate on the gays or well whoever they choose to. Many people saw this lack of critical thinking when he stated about evolution, ""I think it's a theory...the theory of evolution and I don't accept it as a theory. But I think the creator that i know, you know created us, every one of us and created the universe and the precise time and manner and all. I just don't think we're at the point where anybody has absolute proof on either side."" And we were all told that he didn't mean it (which he has never came out to clarify it at all or to change his statement) and that he was being taken out of context, or that it didn't matter what his views on evolution were it wouldn't effect his politics... Well bad news for people, it does effect his politics because its how he thinks, he follows dogma then sticks to it, unless it conflicts with another piece of dogma he blindly follows. That just really bugged me about the ron paul debate that was going on for awhile, his stance on evolution illustrates quite clearly his inability to careful consider the evidence and then make a decision, instead.. he makes the decision first, and then tries to ignore the evidence or misrepresent it to fit his preconceived stance.

Sorry for the rant..

edit : already at the up/down vote war here.. Seriously, if you think I am wrong with my assessment, please.. try to point out where I am at fault and why, its a little annoying how ron paul fans never seem to be able to defend against these claims with anything of substance. ","1335831768"

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","OK guys, Im going to take you on a magical journey.

The year is 1997, a few years prior I had moved from Pennsylvania to Texas with my father as he worked for a major airline and its hub was in DFW.  I was sad, I left 3 of my closest friends and neighbors behind.  3 brothers, 1 younger, and two older.  I called them, the Boyle Boys.  We shared common interests.  Military, aviation, running around in the woods, smearing mud on our face playing commando.  Well, one day my father told me he had spoken with their mother and arraigned for me to visit for a long weekend.  I flew to PA and met my friends eagerly awaiting me at the airport with their mother.  They excitedly told me about this video game they had recently discovered.  Tie Fighter.  

     When we arrived at their new home, the oldest brother had already made a ""flight schedule"" for us.  We spent the entire weekend playing this amazing game and playing pretend imperial pilots as we watched our comrades in arms battle the rebel scum at Hoth.  We flew with Darth Vader in protection of the Emperor.  We even became members of the emperors secret order.  We slept in their bunk beds and took a break or two to watch the Empire Strikes Back.  This was my first real introduction to Star Wars.  By the time I left I was an expert on the Empire.  I had the best time that weekend and it started a long love for the films and games that never ended.  

  My flight back I somehow got bumped to first class as a solo traveler at such a young age.  The 727 had a first class section that to me looked like the inside of and Imperial shuttle.  For some reason the flight attendants were really nice and gave me all sorts of attention.  I felt like some sort of Imperial war hero.  Cookies and sodas.  I must have had some sort of weird sugar high that flight.  The best part was, no one but me knew how badass of an Imperial pilot I was but me.  I thought, when I arrive at ""Coruscant"", I must convince my ""commanding officer"" (dad) to buy a computer and get this new game ""Xwing vs TIE Fighter""

I had a wonderful imagination.  And well, I had every significant SW PC since.  Thanks for listening.

He is middle-aged, short, and has a soft-spoken, genteel manner. *Although not Orthodox or visibly observant*, Boro—who is a celebrated criminal lawyer—clearly has strong communal ties. He has served as president of the Canadian Jewish Council of Quebec and helped the Hasidic community on numerous occasions. He told me that he sometimes serves as the “unofficial and uninvited” spokesman for the Hasidic community when they are in legal trouble.

He has ties to the community but isn't himself Orthodox. What that means is up to you to interpret; just make sure you get the facts right. ","1335831784"

I expect NT Christians in particular to understand that you can't pull a verse or book from any portion of the Bible to justify a position without exegesis. Similarly it's inaccurate for Savage to pull some passage about treatment of slaves/women and say 'Christians should believe this too, they don't so they're hypocrites"" without applying proper historical and cultural filters to the situation.

Your broad stroke of ""contradictions and confusion"" only applies when you take a cursory glance at a list of contrasting passages. Apply the context of a Christian worldview where there's a clear distinction between pre- and post-Jesus, and the contrast makes a lot of sense.","1335831790"

The response to both, it seems to me, would simply be to look at Foucault's historical work. He certainly engages in narration (though he would have no problem with adding difficulty to, i.e. problematizing, this enterprise), and he gives quite particular explanations about how various discourses have changed. His goal is not to provide an overlapping theory thereof, because he thinks it contingent on the particular type of discourse and state of society in which that discourse exists. No?","1335831791"

We're going to have much improved line play, partly thanks to Wells, but mostly thanks to improved health.  It's almost impossible for us to be as injury-riddled as last year.  The scheme fit last year was never good, and that change should help us as well.  I'm dubious about Brian Schottenheimer thanks to what seems to be the universal opinion of Jets fans, but McDaniels's scheme was an unmitigated disaster.

I think Bradford is going to be much more at home this year, with Fisher preferring a conservative offense that minimizes risk... based on his play and his choices so far, I think that will mesh well with Bradford's style.

I'm concerned about our slot receiver to flanker/split end ratio... Amendola, Salas, Smith... all best suited to the slot, and I'm not sure how that's going to work.  We desperately need Quick to be a success.

From the offense this year, we just need to see progress, and see some of the young players come through, particularly Bradford, Saffold and Quick.  The defense has a much higher ceiling this year.","1335831793"

In some places we herd cattle by the thousands and pump them with hormones and food until they are fat as fuck. Not only that, they are in cramped spaces and are not taken care of at all, as long as they remain at good weight no one cares. Chickens are kept in the dark for their whole lives and fed so much that some die from over eating. Pigs are raised similar to the cow and also suffer from disgusting deaths. 

In Spain, at least, the bulls bred for fighting are kept out in fields called ""dehesas"" a semi-protected area full of other wild life. They are let to roam and live a pretty decent life. I'm not disagreeing with the fact that it's cruel to kill the bull in a ring. What i am saying is that if given the choice I'd rather duke it out and live a great life, than to live a shitty life and get slaughtered anyway.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Definitely agree. As a former ""mainstream"" Christian that attended all their events and bible studies I can assure the people who want to believe me that Christianity is a religion of convenience. While the bible has its flaws, it was the illogical and ignorant behaviour of these Christians that drove me away from the religion. Read Luke 16:19-31 about the Rich man and Lazarus. I would like to point out this is in the New Testament.According to Abraham the prophet the rich man went to hell  simply because he was rich while Lazarus went to heaven because he was a poor beggar. I don't see any Christians wanting to be a homeless beggar, they choose parts of the bible to abide by but ignore most of the Bible itself. ","1335831796"

So what I would do is take him to the said and just be like ""Hey, I know that you're probably nervous about this whole kissing thing, and I'd just like to let you know that I'd love it if you did."" You know, sort of take some of the pressure off of him.

More seriously, I think you'd be getting an alert constantly.  Also, how do you avoid the possibility that what you consider to be ethical issues are things I'm perfectly OK with, or even support?  Imagine the most controversial issue that you can think of, and which you care strongly about.  What if I have the opposite view?  Would you be willing to put in alerts for ""This organization is against the clubbing of baby seals!"" if you knew that a large number of people would consider that to be an ethical issue?

I dunno -- it's a neat idea, but seems like an awful lot of work to do thoroughly and fairly.  And IMO there's no other way to do it.  I sure as heck don't want to be alerted regarding all the things *you* care about, I want to be alerted regarding all the things *I* care about.  (If I want to be alerted at all.)

An easier to implement one might be to pick specific issues (and even specific viewpoints of specific issues) and have individual apps that alert for those.  If you tell folks right up front ""This app alerts when you enter someplace that doesn't support the clubbing of baby seals"" then to me you get a self-selecting audience for whom the app is perfect.","1335831803"

"aviation","t5_2qhu8","Considering I've probably read more about the JSF project than I care to admit, I feel I'm entitled to my opinion.

The JSF would be an excellent warplane if they'd dropped the asinine requirements for it to be used as a VTOL jet. They'd then be able to focus more on creating a jet that was both maneuverable and stealthy.

As opposed to flying like a jet boat with stealth features.

The fact is, in theatre it's going to be carrying payloads that require breaking it's stealth.

It can only realistically engage a single enemy fighter as it usually takes two AIM sidewinder missiles to effectively engage enemy interceptors.

What this effectively means is that once the jet reaches it's intended area of operations, it's going to need to jettison it's spare fuel or munitions on it's target then boogy on out using it's stealth to get away. Hopefully avoiding SAM launching vehicles and shoulder fired surface to air missiles until then. It's worth noting that the F-35 will not be completely invisible to RADAR. Just less visible than jets without stealth characateristics. We're depending on OPFOR jets to not possess sufficiently advanced RADAR systems to detect the F-35.

Basically, it's a great jet but it honestly needs more of a payload in order to justify it's cost.

I'm Canadian and as such I think the better alternative to the F-35 is purchasing the F-18 Super Hornet in it's place while the F-35 is sorted out.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;How do we make consumers properly react when businesses (or people) harm non-consumers?

Lawyers often take *pro bono* cases.  They do this because people want to see injustice prevented, and they tend to choose law firms that ""care"".  This is true of most situations.

Further, security and arbitration services will likely take on some amount of free riders, both because it is more efficient to cover a large area (saves them money), and because going after the group that harms one person - even a ""non-consumer"" - prevents them from later harming someone that will cost you more money due to insurance payouts, etc.

Beyond this, I'm going to need to ask again for specific examples.  How are these businesses specifically harming these non-consumers, and then we can see what the solutions may be that don't require government.  Note, however, that the libertarian mindset is to start with looking for a solution in the free actions of individuals, and not through coercive government policy.

&gt;If you really think businesses would not hurt people in a free market anyway, why not have a law about it

Because of the force aspect, and the view that this use of force is immoral.  Here, I am saying that ""law"" (absent government) would be provided by security and arbitration organizations, and is voluntary - if you don't abide by it, the worst that happens is that people find out you are not to be trusted, and they will naturally disassociate themselves from you.

So the ""law"" would say that ""businesses may not hurt people"", and if they do, then the punishment is that everyone knows that ""company X (or individual Y) hurts people and is not trustworthy"" then people will naturally avoid them, even if only out of fear that they might be hurt next.","1335831804"

There is one way to check and know for certain if you replacing the rotors. Grab a caliper (measurement device) and take a measurement of all the rotors. 

Now take your measurement and compare it to the specifications in your service manual. Sometimes the minimum specs are stamped on the rotor itself, usually on the inside inner diameter. 

Will turning the rotors bring the new measurement close to or below the minimum specification?

And that is your deciding factor.

"rocketry","t5_2qhgi","Here's a very simple project that is very fun and rewarding:

You could start by going to the store and picking up some sugar and Stump Remover (found and many Wal Marts). The sugar is your fuel and the stump remover (not stump killer; too very different things) is an oxidizer (speeds up the burning sugar so much that it is like a rocket). The fuel is rediculously easy to make. You can just mix together 3 parts stump remover and 2 parts sugar and try to burn it. Then, make another batch, but this time, melt it on the stove (first sugar, and then mix in stump remover). After you figured out how to make fuel, you can turn a toilet paper roll into a bottle rocket. Basically, take a cardboard tube (the tubes from aluminum foil rolls work the best because they're thick) and place it on a piece of wood. Put a dowel wrapped in plastic wrap in the center of the tube and pour in molten fuel  from the stove, leaving about half an inch of tube left. Fill the half-inch gap with putty (also found in wal mart) after the fuel has hardened and after you took out the dowel. Then take a tissue and put some stump remover with some sugar (not melted together) onto the tissue. Roll the tissue up until it is thin enough to fit into the rocket. This is your fuse. Take a long straight stick or dowel and attach it with duct tape to the side of the rocket. Stick it in a bottle (hence the name ""bottle rocket"" or just put it in a hole in the ground.

"law","t5_2qh9k","It is a systemic trend which current evidence suggests was really beginning several years *before* the recession hit in 2007 -- e.g., as far back as 2000/01/02.  The recession just accelerated what was in the cards already. And what was going on before the recession is continuing after the recession -- the industry is still changing and, from an ""overall employment"" perspective, it's still changing for the worse.

There are many reasons for this and we could devote a thread just to this discussion.  One of them is the rising cost of law school tuition, leading people to have to seek a relatively small number of job slots (high-paying) to avoid sinking after graduation.  Another is the proliferation of absolutely terrible law schools (which, sadly, I'd say describes the majority of all law schools in the nation as of 2012).  Another is improving efficiencies through the use of technology -- you don't need 10 associates to do first-tier document review any longer when you can use predictive algorithmic software to identify the documents that are important.  Another is rising profits per partner in the elite echelons of the legal world.  Another is the spread of easy credit (""loans"") for larger and larger cohorts of people to enter into law school.  And so on and so forth.

The bottom line is this:  right now, if

* you can get in at the **very top** of the legal education system (and this might not even mean the T14; it might mean the T6; heck, for certain fields, it might mean the T3) 
* you have some sort of pre-existing network of contacts within the legal world (e.g., Dad is an established attorney; Mom is a judge; Aunt has been the lead paralegal in the V10 firm's white collar department for the last 20 years; sister runs the DA's office) 
* you can get a lock-tight, no-strings attached full-ride scholarship (and no, ""we'll let you keep it if you stay in the top 25% at the end of the year"" does not qualify) 
* you are independently wealthy, 
* you bring a unique (relatively to the general mass of undergrad humanities students infiltrating most law schools these days) skill set (e.g., a hard science undergraduate major or, better yet graduate degree; 10 years working at Dow Corning; you have 5 patents in your name)
* You have a specifc plan to serve an *objectively, verifiably, certifiably* under-served area of the legal market (e.g., you plan to open up a small shop in a growing population area in New Mexico; you are going to do oil and gas law in northeastern Canada; you are going to practice elder law in northwest Washington state and you've found a previously unidentified cluster of elderly) 

Then I am comfortable in saying ""Go for it, you still have pretty good odds of doing well with this career.""


Beyond those factors, however, it is a real fools bet to try and jump into this legal market now or for the short-term (say, at least next 5-years) future.  Look, I don't have a crystal ball.  I can't tell you what things are going to be like in 2025.  Maybe everything will have stabilized, new growth will have emerged, etc. But, on the same token, I *am* pretty confident that things aren't going to be much better -- and might be worse -- in, say, 2017 (not that far away).

The other thing which, in my observation, people seem stunningly obtuse about (and I'm sorry if I'm coming off as full of disdain here, but I've just seen it so many times that I'm starting to get worn out by it) is that they don't appreciate the effect that carrying the amount of debt necessary (for most) to get through law school will have on your life's trajectory.  Having a $200,000 debt load with grim job prospects can materially affect the course that your life takes not just for the next 1,2 or 3 years, but for the next couple of decades.

Finally: There are *so many* amazing things that you can do with your life, particularly if you are in your early 20s.  I know it may not feel like that at times, but, trust me: it's true.  You can basically, essentially be anything you want to be at this point.  And there are so many things *to be*.  So many things to try, so many areas to explore, so many possibilities.  

Against this backdrop, the case for rolling the dice and joining the masses entering law school becomes somewhat diminished.


**IMPORTANT EDIT:** The other strong piece of advice I'd give you: I am one voice.  There are many others.  The best thing you can do with an important decision like this is to do your research.  *Thoroughly.*  Try to consult many sources.  *Informed* sources.  From different perspectives on the issue.  This is the sort of discernment process that deserves to be done seriously--most notably, for the sake of your own future success!  Good luck.","1335831807"

I'd also recommend some basic mobility and movement prep stuff to warm you up, teach you good movement patters, and work on range of motion. I would also add some glute activation work (cook hip lift, etc.) and then move on to adding hip thrusts and the like (get some glute strength and hip drive).

I'd wait on plyos until you have 150-200% bodyweight back squat or similar. There might be recommendations contrary to that at this point, I haven't looked into plyos in a while....but that seemed to be the dominant wisdom last I was heavily investigating plyos.","1335831813"

I was fourteen and in eighth grade. Our science class was studying water sheds and how they clean water. We were given the opportunity to go on two field trips: one to the water reserve and one to the water treatment plant. We were also told that if we went on one, we had to go on the other. Knowing that the water treatment plant could be smelt 20 miles away, I asked my parents not to sign my permission slip so that I wouldn't have to go on the trip. When the day of the trip came, my teacher told me that I had to go or I would fail and have to repeat eighth grade. Never having a grade below a B before, I was extremely conflicted, so I told another chaperone that I didn't want to go and I didn't have my parents' permission. The chaperone pushed me on the bus (to the reserve, by the way, not the WTP). While on the trip, I eschewed the adults and stayed close to my friends. We got back to the school in time for me to catch my bus home. My mom was livid; the school had taken her chronically ill daughter off campus without permission.

I don't think the Wendy's thing is important, personally... Your grades and any other extra currics should show your work ethic. Instead, select an anecdote about a time you brought something to the table in your research position. Were you ever faced with a tough problem that you solved creatively,for example. Right now all you seem to be able to contribute is your technical background, which all applicants can contribute.

Your first sentence is weak. It is rather obvious that you are applying in order to do a degree. She's not going to also be looking at applications for janitorial staff, etc. start stronger: my ---- years of research in the department's ---- group have confirmed my interest in pursuing --- degree.  Or whatever.

When I personally read your first paragraph, rather than thinking you sound passionate about chemistry, you seem close minded to other subjects and not very well rounded and choose to ignore the great opportunity of learning other subjects. Phrase differently: relishing my chemistry classes I tailored my degree to (a) focus my studies on ---- facet of chemistry (b) gain a broad foundation in several branches of chemistry  (choose a or b or change to fit what you did).

Finally check your grammar, at least one sentence ends in the word for.

Maybe you're checking out different sites -- very few serious philosophers/analytical types cast blame on a specific set of *individuals* for the existence of sexism.  Most feminists I'm familiar with see sexism as institutionalized.  It's not a question of ""these people are being sexist and doing bad things"" so much as a question of ""here are the norms society has internalized and here's how they are harmful to women (and sometimes to men as well).""  What I see on /r/mensrights, conversely, is that ""feminists,"" as in a specific group of people, have actively done these things.  Last time I visited the subreddit there was actually literally a link to a manifesto talking about a vast conspiracy by feminists against men.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I was raised in a large Mormon family, very active. I taught in all the things, god, jesus, holy ghost, santa, easter bunnies, ect, ect.

I was around 7 or so and my dad told me Santa and all the others were fake. Which killed holidays for me. I think them for as a reason to get together and be social. That was when I had a hard time tweasing the the fake from real.

I was sent to seminary every morning (M-F), then went home for Home Schooling. That was lame. I was just happy to be around people at that point.
We had Wednesday activities, and firesides on Friday, and naturally church all day on Sunday.
I wasn't allowed access to anything outside of the church teachings. No other friends than those that went to church. 
I always had my doubts. But by the time I was 18 I'd pretty much been on cruise control. Do what you need to to avoid making anyone upset, don't rock the boat.
But it was that time. Time to submit yourself to the church to serve a mission for two years - Wherever the church decides to send you.

My closest friend, Justin, had submitted his papers, he was accepted and I was putting it off. I just stopped to look at it. Is this something I want to do? It seemed like the moment I stopped to think about it, truly, I had already known I didn't believe it.
This was time to take cruise control off. 
The LDS church had told Justin that he was chosen by god, and that god wanted him to serve his mission in X place.
Two weeks later he was killed in an automobile accident, decapitating him. Only months prior, the church leaders forced Justin and his GF to break up, saying that's not what god wants for him and that if she truly loves him, she'll wait for him. Well...So much for that.

I was also a severe asthmatic, and I literally depended on real medicine to stay healthy. As I got older (6-7 or so), I realized how demonstrably false the whole 'prayer as medicine' thing was - in my case at least. Praying out of an asthma attack is not a real option.

At some point soon after, my growing interest in science (or, as an 8-year old sees it - how shit works) surpassed my belief in the supernatural. I think I prayed to God last when I was about 10. I didn't recognize myself as an atheist until I was 15 or so - about the time I realized people who don't believe in the supernatural labeled themselves accordingly.

Only later did I go back and try to understand Christian Science - and it's actually pretty radical, and not quite as ridiculous as most religions. But, there is still no god - as far as I can tell.","1335831834"

So when you make a subreddit dedicated to libertarian ideals, you shouldn't treat it as your ""private space"", but rather run it as a miniature model of the ideal society.

You are not required to, of course, and if you don't think you are going to, you'd better say it up front, then someone will create r/ronpaul2, or r/ronpaul3, until there's one that is run properly.

Patience is a virtue, for a few months all of my finds were small, a game here, a couple there.

Its all really hit or miss until you find a groove and fill in some holes to make your hunting a bit easier.

It was a stressful place to work, so I usually compensated by being just quirky enough to keep myself sane. Being a cubicle monkey, one of the things I occasionally enjoyed doing was to go stand outside one of the senior staff offices while they were on the phone with a client and make a face until they inevitably looked up and had to fight back laughter / irritation.

So, walking back from the break room one day I finally notice her fielding a call from a prospective client, and took the opportunity to break in a fresh target. I stood straight outside her window and just stared my best crazy-eyed, straight-faced stare right into her brain. Except she didn't look up.

I agree with you -- and as for ""why"" they feel that's okay, I think a lack of empathy is a lot of the problem. People often aren't really intentionally unkind, they just don't realize how their words affect others, and believe that being forceful and critical about someone's health will help more than it will harm. But I think (or at least hope) that the cultural trend in the last few centuries has been towards progressively more empathy and consideration of other peoples' feelings. The emergence of many large people in America is a relatively new thing (within the last 1-2 decades) so maybe our cultural sense of treating other human beings as we wish to be treated just needs a little more time to catch up on this particular issue?

I understand everybody's different. 

The guy I ended up dumping was just....so not on my level. Not by being ""better than"" him, because I know damn well I'm not perfect, but I do know I honestly put effort into our relationship. It was more along the lines of I could not even have an in depth conversation with him at all because it turned into it being all about him. 

This year I made it a point to focus on myself. I lost 35 lbs, got surgery to correct a birth defect that made my left eye droop and now it looks normal, I'm in a healthy state of mind more than ever before and this is my time to find true love whether I'm pursuing it or it stumbles upon me.

A ""rich person"" may cringe at having to spend more money on taxes, but lets face it -- they have more than enough to survive on. Balance it out. Yes, you worked hard (in some cases) for your abundant money, but you shouldn't have issues with putting some of that money back into the society that you *depend* on to keep earning it.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I upvoted you for discussion's sake, but I entirely disagree. I think *Begins* was a spectacular movie and overcomes any shortcomings it had for several reasons:
  1) It gave a new twist to the typical creation story. Especially compared to the only other Batman that mattered, which was Tim Burton's. The entire first half of the movie is like crack for me - I love seeing Bruce Wayne crumble away, like marble, and slowly be transformed into the dark knight. The training sequences with Ducard are undeniably quotable, the ranks of ninjas (ninjas! Done without the slightest amount of cheese!), the creation of the batsuit. That was all stuff we'd never gotten to see on film before.
  2) All star cast. Nolan picked some of the most talented people he could have possibly chosen. Bale, Caine. Ken Watanabe, Liam Neeson. Morgan Freeman and *Gary freakin' Oldman.* Even Cillian Murphy was perfectly creepy, but not too much so, as Scarecrow. Arguably the only mis-cast was Katie Holmes, and I personally didn't think she was a complete fuck-up given the rest of the movie. 
  3) Director stuff. The story makes sense and it's not overly complicated. It's not even overly cheesy; a terrorist organization wants to create mass panic and revolution via a synthetic opiate introduced into the city water system. Bam, done. Nolan brought a depth and a darkness to the dark knight that no previous batman had done before. Even Burton's Batman had a bit of cheesiness to it (especially when you go back and rewatch it from the 21st century). It brought a gritty realism to Batman that nobody had gone before. 
  4) Just because I can, I'll mention the score. Two composers blended together their very different styles into one perfectly awesome soundtrack. I thought the soundtrack for Begins was just about perfect.

Fortunately, Russel had always had a strong psychic side, and when he was five, he'd accidently been possessed by a demon and slaughtered a whole lot of people. So all of his friends ghosts took up residence in his body, the only two that have been named being ""Del, Tha Funkee Homosapien"" (The blue ghost from the videos ""Clint Eastwood"" and ""Rock the House,"" and Phi Life Cypher, from the Clint Eastwood Phi Life Cypher Remix. Del was exorcised by Death himself in 2003 I think, leaving Russel to descend into madness.

&gt;Messianic prophecies were fulfilled (Psalm 22, Isaiah 53, Zechariah 12, Daniel 9:24-27). These examples are very specific and clear and seem to clearly point to Jesus Christ. We know these prophecies came before Jesus’ advent on earth, because the Dead Sea Scrolls contain them and predate the time of Jesus’ arrival.

* **Psalm 22** was written long before the Gospel of Mark. I do not find it compelling that he would allude to earlier writings in the description of the crucifixion of Jesus. This proves nothing.

* **Isaiah 53** I'm going to have to agree with the Jews interpretation on this one. This is speaking about the nation of Israel. This seems like a case of confirmation bias.

* **Zechariah 12** I'm not sure what this has to do with Jesus. Care to help me out here?

 Daniel 9:24-27:
&gt; Jewish exegetes interpret the first ""anointed"" as Cyrus (Isaiah 45:1) whose decree to rebuild Jerusalem came forty-nine years after the destruction of the city and the Temple, which is the time when an ""anointed one"" (Daniel 9:25) is to come to fulfill the prophecy (586-49=537 BC). It follows that the second segment of the Seventy Weeks period, sixty-two weeks long, covered by verse 26, culminates in 103 BC (586-49-434=103 BC) and that ""after sixty-two weeks an anointed one shall be cut off."" This ""anointed one"" would thus have been the High Priest Alexander Yannai (103-76 BC) who came to power just at the end of the sixty-two week period in 103 BC and was the last of the important Hasmonean leaders. The phrase ""after sixty-two weeks"" indicates the time frame during which the ""anointed one shall be cut off,"" that is, suffer ""excision"" (karet). The penalty accompanying karet is here aptly described as ""to have nothing,"" or ""be no more."" This punishment is given to Alexander Yannai, infamous for his unjust, tyrannical, and bloody rule. He is notorious for his open violent animosity against the Pharisees and his brazen rejection of the Oral Law. For example, Josephus records that Alexander Yannai fought against the Pharisees for six years, ""and . . . slew no fewer than fifty thousand of them"" (Jewish Antiquities XIII. 13. 5. [373]). He also ""ordered some eight hundred of the Jews to be crucified, and slaughtered their children and wives before the eyes of the still living wretches"" (Jewish Antiquities XIII. 14. 2.)

Isaiah 44:28; 45:1; and 45:13:

&gt;Thus bible inerrantists would have us believe that Isaiah prophesied specifically that Cyrus would be Babylon's conqueror and would enter through gates, and that he made this prediction over 140 years before the event. In reality, this section of Isaiah was written shortly before 537 BCE, so even if the prediction was not made after the event its occurrence at least was imminent and the name of Cyrus would have been known.

&gt;Isaiah's reference to gates, although the actual means Cyrus used to gain entry to the city of Babylon, was nonetheless meant figuratively. This is evidenced by noting the continued use of obviously figurative language in the next verse:

&gt;I will go before you and will level the mountains; I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron. (NIV)

&gt;It should be noted that Babylon is not actually mentioned anywhere in the chapter.

&gt;It should also be noted that ""anointed"" as used in Isaiah 45:1 is translated into Hebrew as ""messiah"" and into Greek as ""Christ."" Although never admitted by Christians, this passage seems to assert that Cyrus is the messiah. [Citation](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Failed_biblical_prophecies#Cyrus_will_conquer_Babylon)

Moving on...

&gt;Jeremiah predicted that despite its fertility and despite the accessibility of its water supply, the land of Edom (today a part of Jordan) would become a barren, uninhabited wasteland (Jeremiah 49:15-20; Ezekiel 25:12-14). His description accurately tells the history of that now bleak region.

Jeremiah (written 600 B.C) - The destruction of Edom by the Muhammadans (followers of Islam) in A.D. 636. Wow, god uses people of other religions and takes a long time to smite people.

&gt;The exact location and construction sequence of Jerusalem's nine suburbs was predicted by Jeremiah about 2600 years ago. He referred to the time of this building project as ""the last days,"" that is, the time period of Israel's second rebirth as a nation in the land of Palestine (Jeremiah 31:38-40). This rebirth became history in 1948, and the construction of the nine suburbs has gone forward precisely in the locations and in the sequence predicted.

Well:
&gt;That the rebirth of Israel as a nation in 1948 is actually predictive of any Old Testament prophecy is dubious; beyond this however, Ross forgets that from 1948 to 1967 Jerusalem remained under Jordanian control and that whatever building has gone on around the city since then, nothing has been done on the scale that Jeremiah’s prophecy demands either geographically (in terms of size) or spiritually (in terms of holiness). [Citation](http://www.narnia3.com/articles/Jer31.pdf)

On to Babylon.

&gt;These prophets further claimed that the ruins would be avoided by travelers, that the city would never again be inhabited, and that its stones would not even be moved for use as building material 

Saddam Hussein and the UN might have had a problem with that...

&gt;In 1983, Saddam Hussein started rebuilding the city on top of the old ruins (because of this, artifacts and other finds may well be under the city by now), investing in both restoration and new construction. He inscribed his name on many of the bricks in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar. One frequent inscription reads: ""This was built by Saddam Hussein, son of Nebuchadnezzar, to glorify Iraq"". This recalls the ziggurat at Ur, where each individual brick was stamped with ""Ur-Nammu, king of Ur, who built the temple of Nanna"". These bricks became sought after as collectors' items after the downfall of Hussein, and the ruins are no longer being restored to their original state. He also installed a huge portrait of himself and Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance to the ruins, and shored up Processional Way, a large boulevard of ancient stones, and the Lion of Babylon, a black rock sculpture about 2,600 years old.

&gt;When the Gulf War ended, Saddam wanted to build a modern palace, also over some old ruins; it was made in the pyramidal style of a Sumerian ziggurat. He named it Saddam Hill. In 2003, he was ready to begin the construction of a cable car line over Babylon when the invasion began and halted the project.

&gt;An article published in April 2006 states that UN officials and Iraqi leaders have plans for restoring Babylon, making it into a cultural center.[42][43]
As of May 2009, the provincial government of Babil has reopened the site to tourism. [Citation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon)

Final point and then I'll come back later:

&gt;Joshua prophesied that Jericho would be rebuilt by one man. He also said that the man's eldest son would die when the reconstruction began and that his youngest son would die when the work reached completion (Joshua 6:26). About five centuries later this prophecy found its fulfillment in the life and family of a man named Hiel (1 Kings 16:33-34).

If the fulfillment took place five centuries later, with the author of 1 Kings 16:33-34 having knowledge of Joshua, how is that a prophecy? Is there any evidence that Hiel even existed outside the Bible?

Also, why not mention all the prophesies not fulfilled? Here is a [list](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Failed_biblical_prophecies#Cyrus_will_conquer_Babylon).","1335831885"

Nor did I mention that the hops ""diminish"" due to said aging. What I said was, oak-aging smooths out beer considerably. And it does. It's not even disputable - that is in fact the intended effect of oak-aging. Do the original hops ""go away""? No, of course not. They are, however, *balanced* by the flavors the oak imparts. Oak gives beer a sweeter, maltier upfront flavor and higher drinkability.

There are plenty of tweaks and things you can do outside of the game, to get better frame rates, textures, ect. There is someone who publishes his tweaks and improvements for all sorts of games through the Nvidia website that can get really intensive. There are a lot of things that can be changed in the Nvidia control panel and in Windows itself.

I am more inclined to believe the 18% are people that are heavily tweaking their settings in more than just in-game options. Hell, a lot of PC games don't even auto-detect your hardware, so it is almost necessary to make changes.","1335831899"
"discgolf","t5_2qk68","I haven't done it in a while, but I really like [Perfect Putt 360](http://wilkesdiscgolf.org/Perfect_Putt_360.pdf) (pdf link). The instructions are on that link, but it's basically a game that adds pressure to your putts to get you to throw every one like it's important, especially the first and last from each set.

Another one was in an article from Scott Papa in a recent PDGA magazine. He calls it the putting triangle. Grab 3 minis and set them all face up 3 steps away from the basket in different directions. Use whatever number of putters you want (I use 3 because I have 3 identical Wizards). Putt all of them from the first mini. If you make all of them, flip the mini over and move to the next spot. If you miss a putt, finish off your putts for that spot, but leave that mini face up.

Any time you come to a mini that is face up, putt with your regular putting style. When you get back to a spot where the mini is upside down, putt with a secondary putting style (for me, a straddle putt). If you make them all with the secondary style, then move the mini another step away from the basket and set it face up again.

This can go on forever, so you might want to set a goal to reach a certain distance in so many rounds, in so much time, etc. It's a pretty nice way to make yourself practice multiple putting styles.","1335831899"

Dates are stressful for everyone, but imagine adding an oozing layer of awkwardness and general uneasiness and you've got why ~~women~~ people do this.

Ultimately, you don't know how many of these she's sat through or how well she knows herself to be able to say ""Next!"" You don't need to be offended by a woman that knows what she wants, and if anything, you should be grateful she didn't waste your time.

Removal for mana dorks is going to kill your deck, but then it kinda kills your deck already anyway, so might as well go all in on that.

Your plan is now either:

Turn 1: land, mana dork
Turn 2: land, mana dork, rampant growth
Turn 3: land, Titan

or:

Turn 1: land, mana dork
Turn 2: land, Sage
Turn 3: Titan

Turn 2: land
Turn 3: land, Sage
Turn 4: Titan

or:

Turn 1: land
Turn 2: land, growth
Turn 3: land, dork or growth or sage
Turn 4: titan


either way, by turn 3 or 4 you are overwhelmingly likely to play a titan if the opponent doesn't disrupt your play. Of course, they will, but, if someone keeps a slow hand or is just trying to aggro you out they'll very likely lose. The growths also give you a smidge of resilience against wrath.

Although I have a 64bit OS, I could only get PyopenCL to build with 32bit versions of everything.

Install Python 2.7.3 32bit

Install Numpy 1.6.1 32bit

Install ATI Stream SDK 2.2 32bit found [here](http://developer.amd.com/sdks/AMDAPPSDK/downloads/pages/AMDAPPSDKDownloadArchive.aspx).

Then I follow these four steps from the pyopenCL [Wiki](http://wiki.tiker.net/PyOpenCL/Installation/Windows):

* Download PyOpenCL doing: git clone http://git.tiker.net/trees/pyopencl.git (this step produces ""pyopencl"" directory at the current location)

* cd pyopencl

* git submodule init

* git submodule update

I'm building using Visual Studio 2008, so no need to edit anything yet.

Continuing on:

* open the Visual Studio 2008 32bit Command prompt with administrator rights

* cd into your pyopencl directory

* issue the command ""python configure.py""

Then go find the siteconfig.py file that was created in the pyopencl directory and edit it as follows:

    BOOST_INC_DIR = []
    BOOST_LIB_DIR = []
    BOOST_COMPILER = 'gcc43'
    BOOST_PYTHON_LIBNAME = ['boost_python']
    USE_SHIPPED_BOOST = True
    CL_TRACE = False
    CL_ENABLE_GL = True
    CL_ENABLE_DEVICE_FISSION = True
    CL_INC_DIR = [r'C:\Program Files (x86)\ATI Stream\include',r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include']
    CL_LIB_DIR = [r'C:\Program Files (x86)\ATI Stream\lib\x86',r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib']
    CL_LIBNAME = ['OpenCL']
    CXXFLAGS = ['/EHsc']
    LDFLAGS = ['/FORCE']

Then type 'python setup.py install' and pray.

I wouldn't say I need the program for anything in particular. I'm just a mech-e grad student so I love anything FEA/CFD related. Also, I love working on GPGPU problems although I'm just starting to learn OpenCL. Running with  points would be just fine for my purposes.","1335831904"

Why should one person be able to limit the freedom of anyone else?  That's what property does, after all.

In order to justify limiting someone else's freedom, you need a theory of property.  I'd be interested if you can derive one without having scarcity and rivalry rearing their ugly heads.

Here's where it gets ugly.  If you're for IP, how do you justify that, without also justifying real tangible, physical things as property?  Once you have physical goods, then you have at least some instances where two people can't use them at the same time.  How does one person justify a claim that another person would legitimately agree to?

When is property not necessary?","1335831905"

I also found that options aren't very limited for vegetarians. Every non-vegetarian meal seems to have a vegetarian counterpart at the dining commons. I would even go as far as to say it's around 50/50.

I have nothing against vegetarians, but the problem I am having is that I (over)pay for these meals and I pay for the convenience, so the least they could do is meet my dietary needs every day without exception. Also, discriminating against the majority (i.e. meat eaters) is just bad business.","1335831910"
"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","Personally, I would disagree with this author of this article and say no.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember JKR ever saying that Voldemort was born without the ability to love.  I do think he was born with an inclination to seek power, but, had he known love as a child, he may have used that power for good rather than evil.

One thing I would agree with the author of this article on is the idea that villains as well as heroes should be complex, multi-dimensional characters, and not just flat characters that are nothing but evil.  It helps convey the idea that everyone, even people who do horrible things, is a real person with real hopes/fears/relationships/etc just like the rest of us.  In my opinion, the young Voldemort is the former sort of villain, with some ability to love, however limited.  I think, however, that the involvement of Horcruxes in the story makes Voldemort sort of an exception to the general rule that all characters, even villains, should be complex and multi-dimensional.  In other words, he stops being a ""real person"" as soon as he starts making Horcruxes.  For this reason, it is important that JKR shows us the young Voldemort, not only for the logical coherence of the plot, but also so that we can see how he goes from being merely a flawed individual to being the embodiment of evil we see in most of the series.","1335831910"

A lot of people don't realize that voc rehab works w/mood disorders as well as all of the typical disabilities you would expect.  

States vary in their admission processes, funding etc. aBut, the fact that you lack education made me think about voc rehab.  (not to mention I'm going thru it now the focal disabilities are not psych but my psych will  affect what I will be able to move into w/my reduced vision)

These will have been devised so as to meet certain desirable properties, which will hold given that the assumptions on which the procedure rely are true. These desirable properties may be described as: validity, optimality and invariance. Of these ""validity"" is most important, followed closely by ""optimality"". ""Invariance"" may be considered as a property of the method of derivation of a confidence interval rather than of the rule for constructing the interval. In non-standard applications, the same desirable properties would be sought.

That's bribery.  Giving $1M to a campaign is ok.   Giving $1M to a campaign with the arrangement that he will legislate you some pork or carve out is illegal.  And that is the problem we face.   My displeasure is with the politicians who are so easy purchased for such trival sums.  $80k gets you an Ambassadorship.  Wtf.  $250k bundled gets you $500M in federal loan guarantees.  Who knows what trival amount was spent by the insurance industry to get Obama to literally force every American to purchase their products.



We can remove a huge chunk of this if it wasn't so easy for a congressman to attach a rider to a bill.   We can remove this further if massive slush funds weren't being appropriated to executive branch departments where they end up with little to no oversight.

&gt;most people get their political information from the media, unlimited money pouring into political ads means the office goes to whoever spends the most.


So your solution isn't more speech, it's to pass laws that ban speech?  It isn't to trust the populace to make their own decision, it's to control and restrict what information they are given?   

You want to control people because you are afraid for what they will say and others will believe them.


You are a tyrant.  I want to enforce laws already on the books.  Have actual justice being done.  You want 1984 where only approved political speech is shared.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Personally, I wish MLG would offer a 'Platinum' or 'All-Access' type of membership. It would be an all-access pass to every single MLG event that year. Probably $50 or $60 but you wouldn't have to buy arenas separately.

By adding this option, people could simply buy access to every event that year if they wished, or simply pick and choose which ones they wanted as they went along. Either way MLG wins, and the fans win.

I don't like the way the last arena was priced, I think $10 should be the maximum, especially considering they were broadcasting at the same time as Dreamhack which had free 720p.

I bought the NASL Season 3 Pass at the start of the season and I am really enjoying it. 4/5 BO3s a day, 5/7 days a week, 720/1080p and two sets of commentators. That adds up to $20 for roughly 10 weeks of play, plus Grand Finals. I think it is a great value. And when compared against MLG seems like a better deal. Additionally you can watch all of NASL (minus the Sunday Showmatch BO7s) for free, while MLG only offers the Season Championships for free.","1335831924"

Not over yet, City crumbled under pressure before, but being able to see the finish line and having Tevez back could see them take it. It's amazing how well you've done considering this is arguably the weakest United squad I've seen since I started watching football (I might be wrong, the Djemba-Djemba days are a bit of a blur). You'll be stronger next year though, with a couple additions to midfield and an extra year of experience and training for Smalling, De Gea, Jones et al.

I'll fucking hate it if you guys buy Javi Martinez, he's replaced Juan Mata at the top of my wishlist (*sob*, by the way) and I think he'd be incredibly effective for you guys, doing the job Jones has been attempting in midfield much more naturally.

My issue is that while movies can be split into more fun leisurely movies and more serious thought provoking movies, gaming doesn't have a lot besides the fun and leisurely side. I think that's a great fault to a medium that due to its interactive nature has a great opportunity to make you think or feel more than a movie could. Think of a movie like Schindler's List, or Requiem for a Dream, or Saving Private Ryan. These are not fun movies to watch. They're actually pretty difficult to watch at times, but these movies show you something of mankind that you wouldn't see otherwise. These are important, and certainly not for entertainment. But there isn't a gaming equivalent. There aren't really important games that look at a subject matter and treat it in a mature and important way.

"arduino","t5_2qknj","Yes, you can use your own external pull-up resistor. It's just a convenience thing that the Arduino chips have it built it. Most modern microcontrollers do, AFAIK.  
The best way to have it low by default would be with a normally closed switch. But the only thing it does for you is make the logic make a little more sense. If you're running on a battery, the current draw would be higher, so you'd ideally not want to do that.  
Another option would be to wire the switch to 5v rather than ground. Don't use the internal pull-up, then the digitalRead(pinNumber) would return TRUE when pressed. You might need a resistor between the switch and 5v (1k probably) to protect the CPU pin, but that might be overkill. And you might need an external pull-down resistor on the CPU pin, if it falses at all. Otherwise the pin would be essentially floating and prone to picking up signal noise from any high current circuits in your device.","1335831940"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; I disowned the idea of god a long time ago.

This is probably what will save you from needless strain in this time of pain, and the necessity of preachers and family to comfort you with the notion that god will forgive your mother for her act.

I'll quote Matt Dillahunty:

[""I am so happy, so happy, that I no longer think my roommate is destined for hell.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPE_HPBIWp4#t=9m10s)

Now you can focus on the memories of your mother, you will need them in the future, as this is the legacy she left you with. The time when she picked you up after you took a fall, the time she made you dinner, the time she helped you with your homework, made you do your chores, taught you how to do something, gave you good advice or shown her immense love towards you... you'll need that. Everybody living on this planet is a simple human body, but it is the knowledge and information that we share with others that makes us who we are. Remember your mother, remember her well and she'll stay with you for the rest of your life.

&gt;She rejected her family, friends, and happiness because she had an idea of a better place that she would go to.

I'm sure she didn't reject you or your family and friends as easy as a finger snap. Awful diseases can make people think in various twisted ways, and while I have never met your mother, I can probably say what most highly religious people would think occasionally in her shoes: ""I don't want to put strain on my family anymore, there's a better life for me up there, and I'll get to watch my children grow in peace, free from pain. I'll meet them again soon and we will forever be in each other's company."". If we took pure fundamental religious dogma as truth, this would be a noble and fair way of thinking, hence I never blame people for utilizing such logic, as they are in a desperate situation which nobody can understand, and their decisions are usually desperate as well. If she has been in so much pain, enough to not be able to give or receive love and compassion from you or your family, then she may have thought that her life was a life not worth living. Make sure you step into her shoes for a while, and you'll realize she did not want to bring you harm or pain, she has done what she thought was the best thing to do at the time.

I won't go so far to solely blame religion for her death, but I'm not going to take the easy road and say that it had nothing to do with it... religion makes people think and act differently, and that's why I'm always on the lookout for signs of religious activity in sick family members who have never been very religious before. That one small period of time when a depressed person is lost and thinks he/she has found the answer in ending his/her's own life is all it takes... just that one moment.

Always talk to your family, let them know you're there for them, never let them slip into a dreamworld of false hope.","1335831952"

The majority of those things haven't happened yet. I do not have an answer to the Ezekiel with the Temple.

How does this work with these verses.

Isaiah 43:3a "" “For I am the LORD your God, 
The Holy One of Israel, your Savior; ""

Isaiah 43:11 "" “I, even I, am the LORD, 
And there is no savior besides Me. ""

Isaiah 9:6 ""For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; 
And the government will rest on His shoulders; 
And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, **Mighty God**, 
Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. ""

With G-d being savior how can the Messiah be our savior if he is not G-d? 
Also, how can you have a Messiah who, in Daniel 7:14,  “And to Him was given dominion, Glory and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations and men of every language Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed."" Clearly has a kingdom that will not be destroyed, yet in Isaiah 53 he died?

Isaiah 42:8 says “I am the LORD, that is My name; 
I will not give My glory to another, 
Nor My praise to graven images.""

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","7 years makes sense.  Those who buy at the bottom hold for about 7 years, then sell.  Over the next 2-3 years a crash takes place.  Those who buy at the top hold on and then foreclose after about 7 years.   Being cyclical, it makes some sense.  And some people move.  The nice thing is that with these low interest rates, principal payback is doing some decent damage to the principal with the first few years.

True, more homes are probably more than 3.5% down.   But I sort of doubt it, I suspect more of them are using the 3.5% down and keeping the rest for emergencies.  

Most of the housing that is falling is higher end homes which weren't as effected during the crash, not the average homes and not the nominal housing prices.  Those are holding pretty decently.","1335831960"

If it uses a standard SME headshell, or has 1/2"" mounting holes, your best bet is to replace the whole cartridge assembly. If it's an integral headshell (part of the tonearm), it might require a proprietary stylus. You'd have to check the stylus to see if it has a part number, or one that crosses to that particular cartridge. If you can, replace the cartridge and stylus in one swoop with a nice new set. You're probably always going to want to do this to a second hand player - who knows how old the stylus is, or how worn out. Plus, it gives you the room to both fix and upgrade in one shot as well. If you can post a pic, I might be able to help you out with identifying what you have. Part numbers are your best friends.","1335831960"

4.  Don't make a huge fucking deal out of it.  Tell your buddy not to say that on your facebook wall.  Keep it light and simple, if you're thinking about it this much it will turn awkward.

Final point, how does it help your students at all not seeing that language?  Again you aren't saying it, but they're gonna be hearing it at school, and basically everywhere.  Jesus lived among the sinners without sinning, perhaps this is a much better lesson to leave it be and use it as a teaching lesson rather than trying to shelter the students from reality.  People use that language, instead of hiding it and leaving them ill-equipped to handle it as a believer, take it head on and teach them how to live in the world but not be of the world.

"ultimate","t5_2qnym","The three best leg exercises you can do in the gym are [one leg SLDLs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQy9Q25QEeQ), [Bulgarian squats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhJEQrb5NSc), and [dumbbell snatches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv5ROIUqG-I) (easier motion than learning hang cleans with comparable benefits). For ultimate you want single leg stability, which is why unilateral exercises are recommended.

Add in some core (ab wheel, crunches, too many to list), a push exercise (dips), and a pull (pullups/chinups) exercise and you've got a pretty good gym routine.

Edit: You don't really need to start doing plyos (depth jumps, shock jumps, and other advanced plyos) until you can squat 1.5 times your body weight (or bulgarian squat ~75% of your body weight). You won't get the benefits you want and risk injury.

"taoism","t5_2qhmd","I find myself now looking at Tao as being everything that *is* and life-as-we-know-it as being the concepts we apply to that which is. For instance, if you think about atoms, and take yourself to the beginning of the universe, there was nothing around to label them as such, so they just were... whatever they were.

As far as we know, ""we're"" not even around to label ourselves as such. But we're definitely experiencing some*thing*. So we create concepts to describe Tao, or that which is, and more specifically, our personal experience.

As GentlemanNinja said, the character for ""Chi"" describes the experience of steam coming off of rice. But it will never actually be the steam coming off of rice. Neither will the phrase ""the steam coming off of rice"".  Only the steam itself can be that, and only in that moment. 

So while I think ""Potential"" very well can be interchanged with ""Tao"", neither, as word or concept, will ever actually replace that which they attempt to represent. I believe that's why Lao Tzu said Tao could only ever hint at the truth. ","1335831975"

Loot thresholds exist with packs, which prevents the system from breaking. For instance recruit packs have a 0% chance for a rare item. 

I'd argue if you got to the point where you absolutely MAXED out all commons/uncommons/characters/customizations, a veteran pack should yield you a rare. At that point you've probably either spent a ton of money, or have played the game way beyond 'normal' means, and should be rewarded.

It would be nice if churches didn't discriminate at all, however most people accept that they have the right to refuse to ordain as ministers, women, or homosexuals. But when they start a business outside the walls of their church, then they should be held to societies non discrimination laws.

What started out as a little club team ran by my teammates dad, turned into State tournaments, Regionals and Nationals for three years straight. We were very good and very young. I remember one time specifically when I let two perfect pitches past me at a state tournament. My coach called a timeout, grabbed me by the mask, whipped me around and screamed ""GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS AND HIT A FUCKING BALL FOR CHRIST SAKE!"" I was like 13 at the time, tears welled up in my eyes and made a base hit. Though his hurtful words turned me into a solid player (and great hitter if I can brag a bit) He also shot my confidence and ruined the game for me. I feel like I could have made it far past high school softball, but my self esteem was suffering. So, this struck a chord. That is all. **TL;DR I played softball with a verbally abusive coach at a young age and it ruined the game for me.**

 &gt;“I thought that only applied during church” I asked

You should put a comma or a question mark there after church. 
&gt;“Well done Spearhead, you’re not as ignorant as your people it seems.” she said

The period should be a comma, and you may want to put a comma before ""it seems"", so it flows a little better.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I went to Catholic school. To explain HawaiianDry's response, at my school a lot of stupid shit could get you expelled, but it was because they were looking to expel you. I don't know if it's a strictly ""Catholic school"" thing, but it's indicative of their ""private"" status that they can get away with a lot more than public schools, in terms of expulsion. 

I know that the administration would really zone in on kids they thought were trouble (the majority of the time, they were kind of right in who they had labeled, but it still wasn't fair--especially to the couple of kids they had ""wrong""). From then on, those kids would get in trouble for small things, that would compound into big things: I.E. they thought John was bad, John would get three detentions in a week for having his shirt untucked, which turned into a ""weekend"" detention, and he got two in a month so that was an in-school suspension which could lead to a disciplinary hearing for expulsion if it happened more than once, etc. etc, etc. 

Kind of like profiling for what they called ""punks."" And the kicker was that they often weren't outright expelled--they'd bring kids in and ""pressure"" them and their parents to find other school options because technically, private school can ""un-invite"" you to re-attend each year. Most kids would ""choose"" to leave without the formal expulsion.

On the other hand, if you're closing in on the end of the school year, I would recommend talking to your teacher about meeting outside of class or finding another student to tutor you.

On the landlord front, I have three pieces of advice:   
a. Read your lease and any other written rules carefully. I've seen a couple of really nasty catch-alls like, ""the following breeds are prohibited: pitt bulls, akitas, ..., huskies, and any mixes thereof at the landlord's discretion."" They basically say that if they think your dog looks like a prohibited breed, it's not allowed. Luckily most landlords aren't this ridiculous.   
b. Find some excuse to visit the landlords and bring the puppy along. Introduce her to the landlords as a lab mix (or whatever you decide she is) while she's still an adorable baby.   
c. Don't give the landlords a reason to want her gone. Give her enough exercise, don't let her destroy the property, and start practicing training now.

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","One variation from this is to apply a light colored shadow of to the center of your lid, about the width of your iris. Then blend a dark color into in starting from the inner and outer corners of your eye, so you get a spotlight effect on the center of your eye. You can make this look either really demure or really dramatic, depending on your mood. For demure, you can get a subtle center highlight by choosing shadows that are only a few shades different. For dramatic, you can do something really high contrast...like black into silver or dark blue into white. 

Another option is to do a smokey style eye, but exaggerate the outer corner to make your eye seem elongated. To do this, connect the upper and lower lids with a dark colored shadow on the outer corner. Instead of blending up into the crease, focus on blending out. You can choose to make the shadow come to a point, like a blended out cat-eye, or make it into a more rounded, egg shape.

You can also play with the shape of your crease. The most common crease blending concentrates the largest amount of color on the outside of the crease, and blends that upwards. Instead, you can place the largest amount of color on the inside of the crease, closest to your nose, and fade that into the outer corner.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; First of all, Israel doesn't deny any basic foodstuff, and hasn't for years.

Simply not true. [Israel blocked macaroni and lentils as luxuries as late as 2009](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100885553).

&gt; That's simply not true. Israel withdrew from Gaza in September 2005, the blockade started in June 2007.

Simply not true.     They loosened up the Egypt crossings.  Nothing more. 

[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip#1989.E2.80.932004)

&gt; The Israel Defence Forces left the Gaza Strip on 1 September 2005 as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. An 'Agreement on Movement and Access' between Israel and the Palestinian Authority was brokered by Condoleezza Rice in November 2005 to improve Palestinian freedom of movement and economic activity in the Gaza Strip. Under its terms, the Rafah crossing with Egypt was to be reopened, with transits monitored by the Palestinian National Authority and the European Union. Only people with Palestinian ID, or foreign nationals, by exception, in certain categories, *subject to Israeli oversight*, were permitted to cross in and out. All goods, vehicles and trucks to and from Egypt had to pass through the Israeli crossing at Kerem Shalom, **under full Israeli supervision.**[30] Goods were also permitted transit at the Karni crossing in the north.

Israel still maintained full control of the sea, and of the air.   Goods could enter only through Israel, or under full Israeli control.

High School. Four of the most important years of your life. But it isn't always dances and keg parties and sucking face in your parents' mini-van. Sometimes it's ugly and hard and complicated. As complicated as a conspiracy to overthrow the president. There's something rotten at St. Donovan's High and sophomore newspaper reporter Bobby Funke is on it like pink rubber bands on your little sister's braces. When senior hottie Francesca Facchini solicits Funke's help tracking down a set of stolen SATs, Funke uncovers a story dirtier than the lunch lady's mustache. After he fingers the school president (figuratively) for the crime, Funke becomes one of the most popular kids at St. Donovan's High. No longer known simply as the freshman who was once tied to a giant snowman penis, Funke wins the respect of everyone from the Desert-Storm-hero-turned-educator Principal Kirkpatrick to the kid that farts on him in Spanish class...

* 6x Tiamat: 50*6 = 300
* 300 + Base Damage (118) = 418
* AOE Multiplier = 0.5*6 = 3.0
* AOE Damage with one hit = 418 * 3 = 1254
* Infinite Duress strikes 5 times
* Infinite Duress AOE Damage = 1254 * 5 = 6270

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Yes, and what I am saying is that it all evens out when the state doesn't have to take care of their elderly asses when they die at 50 of a heart attack. 

Say a fat person, Joe, goes to the hospital a lot more during his life, and he racks up $50,000 worth of bills paid for with taxpayer money in 50 years. He dies of a heart attack at age 50 and the state stops paying for him to go to the hospital because he doesn't need it. He's dead, Jim.

So then say there is a thin man named Roger. Roger is of the same income level and insurance status as Joe. In 50 years Roger has racked up $10,000 worth of hospital bills. So it seems like fat people are a larger drain on the system. But wait! Roger is still alive, he is going to live a long and healthy life. By the time he dies at age 80 the state has paid a total of $50,000 on his behalf, possibly more if they were paying for any sort of nursing home. 

So, you can see, it all evens out in the end. Fat people use more resources in a shorter amount of time, but die earlier. Thin people use less resources at once, but have a longer life span and therefore take up the same amount of resources total.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I own a year old red 3/4 heeler, 1/4 border collie so maybe I can offer some insight from what I have learned over the past year:

You are right, strong leadership is important, small gestures everyday is enough and if you are consistent you only have to assert yourself sometimes. Yelling and shoving will never ever work for any heeler(or ACD), this gets them more riled up and they begin to see it as a game. Brain games tire them out faster than physical games but both are great, play often. My ACD can be lazy too and is mostly content just to be by my side, although every day is different. Important to get them out of the house and I felt there was never enough time for socialization, this keeps their minds active and is wonderful for putting them to sleep. Expect an ACD to instinctively want to chase anything large or moving. First lesson for my ACD: no biting socks. Second lesson: Cats are sharp. Very protective of the house. Also, she tests every one and if she thinks she can get away with things, she will. I have had to resort to training my roommates. Super smart, she will learn anything I try to teach her. At 3 months old she knew sit, down, shake, rollover, and high five. She is just now getting into frisbee which is her new favorite. Very well motivated by all things although some are more valuable to her, she will do whatever you ask for a ball. 

So, just a few things there, I could go on and on. I love having an ACD though, she is a really great dog and keeps impressing me as she gets older. She's a total ham too, if you check my other posts I have tons of pictures of her up. She has a very strong personality and is a super cuddly dog too. If you have any more questions about ACDs I would be happy to tell you from my experience with them. ","1335832045"

It's not really true to an AK105 as it has an underfolding stock and wood handguards but I really like it. Has a 14 inch barrel with a pinned and welded extended gas booster. I REALLY like the look of the 104 and 105 AK's. [Arsenal SLR 107 CR AK104 clone](http://i.imgur.com/g07nZh.jpg) Hands down my favorite rifle. In fact, I was really getting into the 5.45x39 caliber but this made me fall in love with the 7.62 all over again. Thinking of getting a side mounted rail and a red dot/EO Tech or maybe a forward mounted with an Ultimak rail but my tacticool accessory phase came and went so I'm not sure if I'll do that and I'm still young so using iron sights is just fine. This is one of my most accurate rifles. Believe me, when people say there isn't much difference between a WASR and an Arsenal, THERE IS! 

Thats my AK family so far. I'm looking to get an Arsenal SGL-31 as an authentic AK74M clone soon. Not sure where to go from there. Probably an AK47 clone (milled receiver, vented gas tube, the works). Then a Dragunov but I'm not paying $5k for a Tigr so I think I might settle for a PSL or something. ","1335832047"

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","Here's what keeps making me feel like this isn't entirely applicable; the Major Issues didn't just go away. We confronted them. Or, it felt like we did. There was a period of intense discomfort and ""talks"" that we hated, and negotiating how to get through disagreements with each other (for instance, I've learned that he's not angry, he's hurt- I can touch him on his arm gently, or say ""please be gentle"", and what I see as anger dissolves). Now it feels like we came out on the other side of that. Things haven't been comfortable- they've been the opposite. It feels like we're risking the stress and discomfort involved in working through things that we should have done a year ago. 

And I'm a little down about meeting anyone else, because I've been going to meet-up groups and trying to expose myself to as many people as I can, and I'm just... not impressed. He's strikingly intelligent, very good looking, passionate, and has a dorky sense of humor that I love. I want *all* of those things in a new partner, and I'm having trouble finding two together. Everyone I meet just seems like they'd be passing the time for me. 

I have a lot of hobbies, a career, and a great apartment- as well as plenty of relationships separate from him- so I believe (maybe falsely) that this isn't just fear of being alone. I like solitude.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I love this trope, but I am hard-pressed to come up with good examples. I like it best when the maps are *exactly the same*, and that's even rarer. Zelda games, for instance, have you frequently returning to the same areas game after game, but the layouts are always different so I don't count them. Apparently, game designers don't like to reuse maps for fear of looking lazy, but inexplicable architectural and geographical discrepancies erode my suspension of disbelief. 

I believe it can be done well with a bit of cleverness, such as the two examples I'm about to list. Though the map may be the same, the game can still provide a new experience by changing what's *in* the map.

Super Metroid pulled this one off beautifully. You return to planet Zebes, where Metroid 1 takes place. You land in the new Crateria region, but you quickly find yourself going down to the ruins of Old Tourian, Metroid 1's final area, and then you take an elevator to Brinstar, Metroid 1's first area. The first few screens of the area are laid out exactly like in Metroid 1, complete with Morph Ball. (It kinda makes you wonder how Samus started Metroid 1 there in the first place.) The rest of the game's map is different, though.

Oh boy, here's a super-obscure one. In Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys, you return to Esteria, where Ys I &amp; II took place. All of the monsters are gone, and you can walk from Ys I's Minea Village to Ys II's Rance Village, which was previously impossible for plot reasons. You still have to fight human enemies in one area, but the lack of monsters is very satisfying. You get to actually *see* the land and *talk* to the people you saved, enjoying an idyllic peace several years afterward. There's very little to actually do here; you can go straight to the one area that has plot if you wish.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;Whether or not the other party accepts or rejects the offer is wholly irrelevant to the issue of the drunk party's responsibility for his/her actions. The drunk party made the choice to drink, made the choice to offer themselves up sexually, made the choice to drive. The responsibility for all of this lies solely with the drunk party.

You consistently ignore the fact that sex involves another person. It is entirely relevant because this entire discussion revolves around the sober person's choice to have sex with a drunk person, not the drunk person's decision to put themselves in a situation where someone might have sex with them. You consistently make the analogy to drunk driving, ignoring the fact that drunk driving does not involve the acquiescence and participation of a sober person, which is precisely the point we are discussing.

A much closer (but still very poor) analogy would be: a very drunk person asks to borrow your car. Do you have a responsibility to refuse to lend them your car?

Pink on the other hand, and see my negative green comment for this, is because we don't actually see it, or we do, but pink/magenta is actually a mental interpretation of a color for which there is no single wavelength.  Therefore, it also gets it's own special name.

Mind my negligence on specifics of Aristotle's life, but it isn't fair to compare certifications and distinctions to a time they did not exist.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","The first thing I want to say is: Don't play for rating.  You will find that no matter how high your rating gets, you will still encounter the same trolls and idiots that plague the lower part of the ladder.  Unless you are in the top .1% of all rated players, your rating is just for show.

Instead focus on improvement.  If you do not have around at least 3000 games of experience there is surely lots more for you to learn.  You will lose even if you are talented and prepared.  You should focus on getting experience and learning where to identify mistakes and how to correct them.  If you succeed in improving, your rating will naturally show it, over time.  Don't just say you want to find out where you stand, it's a waste of games.  Pay close attention to your game and always aim to get a little bit better than you were before.

You said that you wish to improve your game more naturally than forcibly, but what is natural improvement?  If you are to improve then you must first observe that there is improvement to be made.  It's not a subconscious act.  You're going to realize that doing things a certain way is superior to what you were doing before.  And so all improvement is deliberate.  You can get 10,000 games of experience, but if you never change what you're doing you will not ""naturally improve"".

Play for yourself.  That is the nature of solo queue.  If that is not your style, then stick to arranged teams.  Solo queue rating is merely a measure of how well you can get along with strangers.  Nothing more and nothing less.  I do not believe that your solo queue rating is a measure of your worth in an arranged team.

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","Well, since I've been primarily reading philosophy and sociology lately, I mean ""norm"" in that sense: expected behavior within a particular context. His belief that femininity is the norm (in the social sciences sense) is the thing that the original poster is complaining about. He has the sense (justified or not) that ""camp"" is the norm for, let's say, the gay community, or at least what he's been exposed to of said community, and like any social setting, going against norms carries social consequences.

That's his argument, which I'll leave it to him to defend. I simply included a remark about norms to attempt to clarify the original poster's point. I've always been pretty disconnected from the gay community (again, in the sense the original poster would intend the phrase), so I don't know enough to comment.

My problem is the *incredible* bullshit of saying ""stereotypes are there for a reason."" The only way I would even entertain the idea of this stereotype is if there were some neurological factor behind sexual orientation that also makes people prone for masculine or feminine behavior -- which is possible, but to my knowledge there isn't a single shred of evidence to support it.","1335832067"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Don't kick yourself for screwing up before. Just move on from it now and stop it from happening again. I usually give myself a few days after a breakup to just.. be emotional and go a little just-dumped crazy. After 2 days, I force myself to stop. The 3rd day is my ""time to move on"" day. I wouldn't contact her first at all if I were you. It'll make her a bit more curious as to what's going on with you and why you suddenly don't need her attention as often.

Oh definitely, I'm not trying to say to just go be with other girls. My ex even did that as a way to try and distract himself from me, which is a stupid idea. Don't pursue other girls until you're totally over another girl, for the sake of your own mental/emotional health and her own feelings. Don't let anyone try to convince you to date other girls. That's not a sign of moving on, a sign of moving on is just being around other people and keeping yourself busy and just generally keeping yourself happy. I'm not trying to say you should be like ""whatever bitch, fuck you i'm moving on"" but just don't let yourself hold onto the idea of her coming back too much, just for the sake of your own wellbeing. I don't at all mean you should give up on her entirely, and I think the approach you're taking is going to end up the way you want it to.

Even if she seems like she's moving on, months from now that could make her come back to you. If she gets into a relationship with another guy, and realizes how he doesn't treat her as well as you did or even just know her or understand her as well as you did, that could be a reason for her to come back. So you definitely have a lot going for you. Who knows, maybe I would've gotten back with my ex if he hadn't acted like such a psycho? But then again that's just his personality which is why I happily moved on from him to a much better man.. LOL.

"Scotch","t5_2qq65","I'm starting to seriously suspect that I got a bad bottle of Talisker 10. I keep seeing it recommended to beginners (which I am). I got a bottle and found it to be intensely phenolic. Like smelling and tasting a band aid and nothing else. No smoke, no wood, no fruit. Just band aid.

The same day I tried Laphroaig QC and I found it to be insanely good. Like smokey barbecued ribs. I loved it. 

I have tried the Talisker several times since then and each time I just don't enjoy it.

Is it me? the bottle? or is that really what everyone is recommending people try?

**Edit: I am not a quitter.**

I sat down tonight with a dram of Highland Park 12 and a dram of the above mentioned Talisker 10. I took my time with both of them, nosing back and forth. This was very educational. I feel like I know the HP reasonably well and having it nearby to smell helped me to tease out a lot more of the non-phenolic aromas that are indeed present in the Talisker.

Similarly, with the taste, having a comparison really helped a lot. I am tasting more pear-like sweetness, and peaty-freshness. Theres a little smoke right away that fades. The phenolic quality is there in the back and it feels like more of a gentle reminder rather than an upfront blast.

In the finish I am getting hints of sweet-anise, no smoke, and a bit of lingering vegetal peat.

This dram has gone up several notches. It seems like time in the glass and more experience is allowing me to enjoy this whiskey more. I am excited to continue sampling and seeing what else it has to offer.","1335832080"

When the Repo market dried up, that part of the financial system exhibited very similar patterns to a traditional systemic bank run. The institutions were heavily reliant on short term loans, and those are analogous to retail deposits. When the investors providing the repo loans lost confidence they stopped serving the contracts ('withdrew their deposit') and the large institutions became illiquid, basically overnight.

The banks were thus acting like a banking sector without a lender of last resort, but instead of cash deposits forming their liquidity basis, it was repo.","1335832083"

No matter which polygon you draw (square, pentagon, hexagon, decagon, etc), and no matter how you divide it into triangles (as long as you follow certain rules explained in wikipedia),  the following will be true:

V - E + F = 1 

where V is the # of vertices in your figure, E is the # of edges, and F is the # of faces.

You can do the same experiment with a 3-dimensional figure as well, like a cube, dodecahedron, or icosahedron.

Next time you have to go in, request that your curtain be left open, and keep it that way until you are completely comfortable with lying on the bed with the IV in your arm.

From there, try to have the curtain closed for a half-hour at a time, until you feel comfortable with that much. If you start panicking, open the curtain and try to stay calm. I'm no professional, but the first step to any sort of treatment is being comfortable with the thought of it, the manner in which they treat you, and everything about it.

"economy","t5_2qhpn","Yeah I'm sure that those 62% are just *itching* to become renters again.

Not.

BTW, the REAL ""homeowners"" (those with 100% equity and ZERO mortgage debt) has pretty much always been around the ~30% of the population.

Another ~20% to 30% of the population (most of the other half of the 62% cited) are the people who have *some* significant equity in their homes (&gt; 20%), but also have (minor) liens/mortgages on some part of their home's value.

And no matter WHAT is done, the percentages above really don't change all that much.

What has fluctuated up &amp; down are the remainder of the population -- who bounce between being so called ""homeowners"" and ""renters"" -- highly-leveraged people with little or no savings to buy a home, and once ensconced in one seldom have or get any equity in their homes, and when they do attempt to refinance or take a second mortgage to extract that equity... or when that is not possible, they sell upscale/upgrade, then get foreclosed on, move back to renting, ""buy"" again, etc. -- *this portion of the population are really never ""homeowners"" in anything buy the most formal and superficial sense;* they are arguably far more like temporary leaseholders.

All of the crap with housing bubbles, subprime financing, etc. -- all any of it manages to do is to muck around with the size of that last group; shifting a few percentages back and forth between whether they are ""renters"" or ""new homeowners"".

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","&gt;... it definitely isn't the thing to do at every job.

Burning bridges is not the thing to do at *any* job.

You don't need to do it, it can only come back to hurt you later. There is no upside to it.

It's not like they are going to take it and then sit back and thing, 'You know.... that guy Droocifer is right: we're a bunch of shit-eating douchebags.' They are more likely to sit there and think, 'Well, we're better he's gone now'..... *and then never, ever give you a second thought until they get the gift to burn you in kind*.

I get where you are, I've been there before. I've walked out on jobs before, just literally thrown my door keys to the receptionist on my way to my car. And I can tell you there has been no upside. 

You wonder if you can use anyone there as a reference. Even if they want to, they might be threatened enough by management over your stunt to now not want to... which happened to me. 

You will eventually end up worrying if the person you're interviewing with *knows* one of the people you burned, which has almost happened to me: A current boss found out in casual conversation with me that she was actually neighbors with the boss I had burned! Fortunately, I was doing well on the job and it never came up again. But it could have come up during the interview, very easily so.

And then that is one fewer employer that you can ever go back and hope for a job. You probably have done good work for them. Maybe in the future you'll need that job back, but now you can't. Yeah, yeah: you'll never go back to them. Well, maybe your bank account says differently at some point in the future. But even if the management changes there, you're done there for good.

Lots of people nowadays could use any job. Don't ever be arrogant enough to believe you or I won't ever be one of them.

It's just not worth it. If you snap and just quit, that's one thing. But you're premeditating it and hoping to get some sort of awesome feeling out of it. That's not being mature, since you are truly just hurting yourself and the people you are burning aren't going to care about how you think anyway.

Do as you see fit. But give it some serious thought about never doing it. The only person you are going to affect is you.

Good luck.","1335832101"

Yeah. There are a lot of studies on this issue and it's shocking how unaffordable eating healthy is.

We now live in a society where a value menu hamburger costs the same as a head of lettuce, and that's fucking backwards.

That said, yes, it'd be easy for them to do the opposite of what they claim and in the interest of the some very powerful people for them to do so, but other than a fear of that being the case, what reason do you have to believe that they do?

But if someone posts a story that is poorly written, a wall of text, or just nonsensical and so terribly told as to not even be believable despite an attempt to suspend disbelief, I think it is certainly warranted to point it out and offer constructive criticism. Conversely, talented writers should be praised for their good work.

but lets pretend we make a bid and offer suitable wages, we still cant offer him Champions league football next season, and based on our current standing it might seem to him to be a few years before we could.

This needs to be emphasized, because it's really the elephant in the room when this subject comes up. The most conspicuous traits of a man who says he's been ""friendzoned"" all relate to being a failure as a man, by traditional standards of what a man should be. He's sexually unsuccessfully, lacks virility. He's openly admitted to weakness and distress- and at the hands of a mere woman, at that. He's usually on the passive, unassertive side and so isn't well-suited to the the role of initiator. He follows a stereotypically female courting strategy.

I think showing the daughter a diagram might be useful, explaining where the seed is made in a penis and then explaining where an egg grows in a uterus could be a good way to talk about what sex is and how it is an adult activity. (It's probably a good idea to focus on the scientific purpose of sex, rather than explain that its done mainly for pleasure. Pleasure can be something you talk about when she gets closer to puberty)

you can say that young people can practice sex by themselves  and explain that what she felt from the running water was like practicing for sex, but she should not use running water in case the tap gets too hot, and she should be careful because if she practices too much she might bruise herself, explain that practicing sex should be done alone, in private.

Explain when they are older they can talk about sex with other boys and girls they shouldn't try sex until they are ready to have babies. (again, suggesting that sex is a commitment for mature people only)

If she is showing too much curiosity about having babies, have her take care of an egg or small pet (Like a goldfish or insect terrarium) and explain that a baby is even more work, and a baby is much bigger than a bug/fish so she should wait until she is much bigger so she can carry her baby.","1335832155"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I will say all of the issues you discussed about men's rights piss me off greatly as a feminist.  I don't know them in as much detail because they are discussed less frequently in feminist circles but the underlying sexism that hurts women hurts men just as badly and its evident in all of these issues.  The paternity one especially pisses me off.  If we really want families to care for children equally we sure make it hard for them to do this.  The divorce court issue is the same way.  Its really disgusting.  The assumptions that men are naturally violent and unruly and should be treated as such manifests in so many ways and it is completely wrong.  I've always thought the way we justify rape in prison too is incredibly disturbing.  Rape is one of the more horrifying things anyone can go through and no rape is EVER justified.  I think one of the perceptions that hurt men that I've personally hated the most is the view that men are inherently going to violate women because ""thats how they are programmed"".  Men are just as in control of their actions and any man or woman who sexually violates another person is completely responsible for their actions.  Its hurtful to view all men this way since it is completely unfair to all the respectful men who view women as equals.  I hate sexism in all its forms and the more I learn your movement is also very important to me.  I just didn't know enough about it and assumed you guys were perpetuating sexism based on a sexist bigot who was paraded as a true men's rights activist.  I'm really sorry I mischaracterized you guys.  You really care about all the same issues I do and I think feminism and men's rights are really just two sides of the same movement.","1335832156"

I'm not really sure how you could beat someone in a straight line sprint when they are faster than you, but if you could it would be because your superior skill allowed you to overcome the my talent advantage. (Which in this case I guess would be pure speed).

&gt;The phrase you're looking for is ""Rose has more physical tools than Paul."" THAT would be true. The shit you said is inconclusive and semantic arguing.

That's what I said. The definition of talent I've been exposed to is pretty much ""physical tools"". Based on the definition I was using, and I thought everyone else understood, it's neither inconclusive, nor semantic arguing.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Actually, there is ""kind of a way"" to do this. The HP bars are broken into segments. Each piece is exactly 250 HP and this is true throughout the entire game. You can actually set a cvar to change that 250 to anything (say 100). You could even make aliases for each hero, that changed the bars to be equal to your nuke (for example you could set the bars to 300, to match brood's spiderlings damage). 

Using this method would be an easy way to know how much HP everyone has.

"MTB","t5_2qo3d","I don't think using any trails your not suppose to is cool. However, I am more understanding to mountain bikers using hiking trails than I am to horses using bike trails.  Even on multi use trails the damage horses do is immense.  From my experience many of them didnt care about if trails were dry or not.  They put massive post size holes in the trail.  They cause trails to widen much more than bikes do when they try to avoid mud holes they've caused.  Hitting horse shit and having it kicked up on to you sucks when you go for a ride.

I've seen these used on mountain bike trails to keep horses and motocross out and love them for that.

Using trails you aren't suppose to again isn't cool.  However when bikes are on hiking trails worst case you get an impolite pass.  The damage really doesn't compare to even hikers who a lot of time walk side by side and expand trails.  Worst case you get an impolite pass that a hiker wasn't expecting.","1335832171"

Now, you are coin-god, imbued with perfect knowledge of these coins--you know exactly what every future flip of each of them will be.  Every single one, down the line, no matter how many flips it takes.

How many coins do you need to have, in order to choose a single one that won't land tails in heaven? 2^1024, or 179769313486231590772930519078902473361797697894230657273430081157732675805500963132708477322407536021120113879871393357658789768814416622492847430639474124377767893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110

Now, I'm led to believe that heaven is *even longer* than 1024 years.  But even if a person with free will makes a sin/no sin choice only once a year, God will need 2^1024 people to get even one person eligible for 1,024 years in heaven; and humanity simply isn't going to get within fractions of a percent of that number before the stars burn out and the protons decay.

So who gets to go to heaven if there's free will there? Not even a tiny percentage of a single person, for a finite amount of time.","1335832172"

"politics","t5_2cneq","There is a reason why words have synonyms. Each synonym is used to convey a meaning in a different context. Saying that all synonyms mean exactly the same thing regardless of context is disingenuous. 

I might not believe in the bible, but I think everyone who does should have a historical understanding of its history. 

The issue of new testament and old testament date back to the first and second century. A man named Marcion of Sinope wrote that the God of the old testament was incompatible with the God that Jesus spoke of in the new testament. His views developed into Marcionism which is a dual god belief. That the God spoken of in the old testament (YVHW) was not the God that Jesus spoke of. Marcionism describes the old testament God as a lower entity of the new testament god who is considered all loving, opposed to vengeful. This belief resulted in him being one of the first people excommunicated in the Catholic church. 

It was only in the third century that Christians determined which books would form (our now view) the new testament. This list of books (all books of the new testament) was officially recognized in 1546 in the Council of Trent. 

I'm only bringing this up to explain to anyone who believes in the Bible but doesn't know. The idea of a new testament and old testament was not based in any divine sense, it came about from arguments that men had with one another. It is a separation made by man, not God. 

Trying to simply explain it as the words being synonyms so they must be the same thing, is a bit ignorant to the history of it all.

You should know the word testament comes from the Latin testamentum, which derives itself from testor: to testify and testis: witness.

Most of the advice given there is ""how to make yourself look more like a child 101"" but SirFraggs (moderator) has some pretty good posts that'll help you out.

Also, you're not going to be able to buy a whole new wardrobe for $100. You could buy, by MFA's standards, *maybe* a few tees and a jacket but that's pushing it. At your age, most of what MFA suggests is waaay above your price range and, all things considered, head.

Your best choice at the moment is to read all the links in the sidebar, get friendly with online retailers (Amazon, Zappos, H&amp;M, Uniqulo, ect), and go through your closet.

Look at what you currently have in your dressers and closet(s). If it's too big for you at the moment, store it away. If it's too small, donate it to Goodwill. This will limit your choices and help you make better ones.

Since you're a teen, I'm sure you have graphic tees. If you have any in your closet or drawers, donate them because you will no longer be wearing them.","1335832184"

Then the worst part. I remembered when I made my account in 2004-5 I was 14-15. But when I was 15 I got a BJ from this fairly attractive girl after a dance, my ""favorite place"" to do naughty with chicks my age. It wasn't so much it took me tons of tries to get it right, It was the fact all I could think about was all the underage sexual activities I had done.

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","I think you've got some variables mixed up here a little.

Happiness isn't something that exists in isolation, its relative and its relation to suffering is _intrinsic_. One does not exist without the other.

Lets say you're a prehistoric hunter gatherer. Yesterday you got no food, today you got food. You're happy, but you'd feel no different if you had food every single day. Its overcoming suffering and difficult positions that give us the sense of true satisfaction that we call happiness.

I personally think you need to detach your philosophy from your personal beliefs a little, especially when you're generalising. To objectively and logically analyse you cannot use your personal frame of reference while retaining objectivity.

Ergo to talk about pointlessness when discussing the human race, our genetic desire and the suffering the human race creates is close to a nonsense. There is no pointlessness because there was never a point. There is no reason we exist yet we do. There is no intrinsic ""right"" or ""wrong"" so to judge all future lives and choices is an insult to their frame of reference. Would you really seek to deny the acheivements of those born into a difficult world that they overcome? Is it not possible that suffering would build stronger individuals?

Perhaps it would be instructive to flip the question. 

&gt; Would it be selfish to bear a child into a perfect world where there is ""nothing"" left to acheive?

In my opinion having children is neither selfish or unselfish. It just is. There is no imperitive ""wrong"" or ""right"" there just is. It's up to each and every individual on this planet to decide what they would prefer and attempt to push the world toward that goal. That's where you can then take your frame of reference back and decide to right wrongs that you perceive.

Let's take your example of conscription. You suffered, you overcame, you identified a wrong. Why not (figuratively speaking) take up arms against that wrong, use your experience to tell the story to others, fight to change your civilisation so that future generations will not suffer the same?

---

The Babylonians had their own problems to overcome. Barbarians, other empires, natural disasters, disease, famine, slavery and so on.

Yes, but this does not mean that these chemicals did not evolve as plant defenses. A plant creating a molecule that can incapacitate an animal by binding its receptors is a highly advantageous adaptation. This is not limited to hallucinogens, either.

"Miata","t5_2smzg","Well, to start you can get one with good (less than 100k) mileage in great condition for about half of what an NC would cost.  I ended up spending ~$9k on mine, it had 47,000 miles on it.  I wish I went even older and cheaper than that!  These cars don't break much, and when they do, it is easy and cheap to fix.  My neighbor bought his '99 with 110,000 miles on it, and my roommate's '95 has over 160 I believe (though his is modified and therefore breaks more).  

If you are looking for your first sports car, you don't really *need* to spend $13k for a miata.  If you want an S2000, $13k will do you well.  But you can get a great miata for half of that.

Edit: Just did a search on Cars.com.  There are 27 Miatas under $7k within 250 miles of me.  First 3 are 99 or 2000s with ~70k miles.  ","1335832197"

"tea","t5_2qq5e","You're getting a lot of advice on here, but I thought I would chime in as some one who recently kicked the soda habit. Actually, I have kicked my 'addiction' to soda multiple times and I think I can give you some good pointers on it.

The parts you love about soda is the caffeine and the sugary taste. No matter what you do you will crave both of these things, I'm sorry to say but as far as I know there is no way to avoid these cravings. 

Obviously cravings are the biggest problem in quitting something and soda is no different. That is why I highly suggest you just go cold turkey and drink just water for at least a month. Why? Because you will make the mistake I have made countless times before. You will stop drinking the soda but you will not lose the taste of it, so some day you will see soda somewhere and think ""Huh, that would be good right now"" and all your weeks/months of no soda will be for naught.

I quit soda about... 2 months ago or so and while I am around it all day every day, now just the smell of it makes me feel a little ill. The idea of of drinking something that sweet is just... gross. Now that I am at this point, I feel safe filling the gap with tea (hence why I am on this /r/), but I know that if I had tried to fill the gap even a month ago I would have over sweetened the tea and lost my fight with soda yet again.

TL;DR: Don't fill the gap with tea yet, deal with the cravings and the caffeine headaches and just drink water for a while. ","1335832198"

It sounds like the game went through some big changes and they might have made progress on ideas they decided to scrap, if they talk about what direction they decided against going it'd be very interesting.

I think Valve are definitely capable of releasing an awesome 'reveal' type trailer. The work they've done with the TF2 'Meet the-' videos has been really impressive especially the ones made later on (Sniper, Spy, Scout and Medic), and as a more conventional trailer the Portal 2 first trailer was great too.

I'm hoping they might do some sort of ARG for HL3 with a trailer hidden at the end, it'd be a great way to get the community back into it without really saying too much about the game.","1335832199"

"PipeTobacco","t5_2rbzz","I'd say all pipe exhale is firsthand since it isn't inhaled. For a pipe smoker the smoke can directly be damaging to the mouth, tongue, throat and nasal passages if you exhale through the nose. Indirectly it can damage the lungs, especially if smoking indoors, and to others around you. However, it is generally accepted that less than 5 bowls a day really only increases your chance of cancer slightly over a non smoker, with the most occurence being of the tongue and throat.  Once a week or even once day would be statistically insignificant since it really isn't researched. ","1335832209"

I did. Your disbelief is noted. 

Please do not call me an idiot. I have not resorted to personal attacks on anyone here.

I was arguing no such thing. I was saying that under certain moral philosophies, human rights don't exist and your entire thought process is a non-issue. The property arguement centers on this. 

Never having been so desperate as to sell yourself into indentured servitude, or having been kidnapped, I would keep speculation to yourself. Instances of slave loyalty run rampant throughout the bible and history books. Not all slaves are going to be happy, but at the very least calm down and speak to me instead of preaching at me. 

I would argue that morality is relativistic unless a God exists. And then we only think it is relativistic, but that is the best we have. In that case, your opinion concerning a bunch of ""immoral pricks"" who formed the foundation of the world as you know it today seems meaningless. Like this question or all of Reddit really.

If you have the money to spend, I would seriously suggest you consider the SkyScanner 100mm table-top.

I don't care about your studies.  I have plenty of fat friends that say the same thing.  You want to ask the 50 to 100 fat ladies I know why they don't shop for clothing more?  I bet not enough selection will make the top 3, right along with clothes that never fit right, and the dreaded dressing room mirror.

DO you think being one of the top three reasons would make a big difference?  I think it would.  I went to a fat ladies store to buy clothes.  They had exactly two pair of pants that were dressy enough for work that did not look like it was from my grandmothers closet.  2!  I bought the rack n my size of my favorite one.  Do you know the grand total number of pants that were available to me in my size in that one favorite style?  1!  I would have bought 5 if they had more.  I asked if they could order some and they just said sorry no.  WTF?!! Where do you say no I don't want your money in retail.  

Those pants are now impossible to find and only crap is in the store now.  I am considering tearing them apart and pulling a pattern from them so I can sew my own.  Can you fucking imagine having to tear apart your only pair of dress pants so you can have more than one pair?  So you can sew your own?  

Let's not even get into how I am supposed to work with only 1 pair of dress pants.  I have to hand wash them every night so they are clean by morning.  There IS an issue of having enough of the right clothes, but no one that's fat will speak up about.  I am fat and I know this to be true.

second i would get yogurt. if you have to shop at a generic supermarket just get stonyfield plain whole milk yogurt. 

thirdly i would get kale or collard greens as they are some of the most nutrient dense vegetables. if there's money left over get some onions. after that get some decent coffee for the dopamine since you aren't gonna have enough for 3 complete healthy meals a day and thus your body will register the deficit especially if you're not under the age of say 26 and you're trying to live more a merely sedentary lifestyle day in, day out over that 30 day span.

In some cases, yes, very much so. I have heard of cases where it gets so bad that people have to change their own name in order to pronounce it. In other cases, it completely disappears. In cases like mine, it is episodic and comes in waves. It's very much dependent, but I would definitely suggest therapy so she becomes more comfortable with her stutter, as being self conscious only makes stuttering worse. 

&gt;Do you catch yourself as you come across a stutter or do you just work it out?

Yes! Many stutterers such as myself can predict when and how we are going to stutter on a word. Occasionally I'll work it out, other times, I'll intentionally stutter so that I have control over it. Sometimes I'll completely change the word, or change the pronunciation slightly in order to get through it. You definitely need to think on your feet for it.

&gt; i have heard him do the porky pig thing, as in, he is trying to say one word, but then after struggling with it, he chooses another, similar word to finish the sentence. Would love to hear more about this.

Yes, this is definitely a method that I use personally. It works phenomenally. It also obligates exploration of vocabulary. Encourage this behavior, as he will learn the specifics of words and language.","1335832230"

No deed, bad or good, is too small (correct me if I'm wrong). Allaah [](/swt) *is appreciative*.

i've heard sayings in which one asks about such and such [student of knowledge] who does not make qiyam and it was said about them such and such is an evil person. 

i love it when people learn about 2 ayat in ash-sharh and are blown away by it

For every difficulty is two eases:

http://quran.com/94/5-6/

but reflecting on that surah it astonishes me we hardly hear the **next** pair:

http://quran.com/94/7-8

just have to read/listen to some of the tafsir for those 2. 

it may very well help you hone the consciousness of being an 'abd. reason/purpose for existence? 51:56. everything we do can be channeled in that direction. when you learn about the Prophet [](/pbuh) it becomes more evident just how much so... as well as *how*.

4. A wider variety of soulbond creatures across less cards
5. More instants, total. I was trying to find some with cantrips, but I got lost in all the visual spoilers.

Like I'm pretty sure the best version of this deck has a few cantrips, snapcasters, and birthing pods. It might be possible to drop white, but the silverblade and cloudshift are too good. Also, that'd be way out of budget, which was one of my goals - something I could build towards.","1335832240"

I'm not certain where to find published statistics on the subject, but as an owner of 3 active small businesses (and 4 that have closed) I can say that every penny counts - especially when starting without venture capital or grants of any kind.  You often have to go without salary just to keep the company running in hard times, while not all of mine have failed and not all of them have succeeded, the rate of success/failure would be lower with increases in taxation - 2 of them barely made it through a couple of years.  The spreads above highlight the general sentiment across party boundaries, democrats seek to force others to spend more, republicans rely on others to donate to charity at their own discretion as it is affordable (though I don't think the majority of either party is evil, just the top).","1335832254"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Oh oh, relevant story here. OK, I was going on a road trip with my Dad and little brother, when my little brother has to stop for a bathroom break. So we stop at a gas station and I go into the bathroom with my brother (he's four, you pervs). When he finishes doing his thing on the toilet and washes his hands he sees some ""stickers"". He says hey to me ""hey, can you get me some ""stickers"". At first I have no clue what he's talking about, then it slowly dawns on me he's talking about the condom dispenser on the wall. I tell him they're not stickers, and he gets disappointed. So I tell him they are something better. Water balloons. I buy about five of them and fill them up, then give them to my brother and tell him to throw them at our dad. I can only imagine how it looked to see a four year old carrying water filled condoms out of the gas station. Surprisingly our dad found the whole thing hilarious, but our mom didn't like the condom filled family portrait. ","1335832260"

However, in this case, he and his kids were using old arguments that were basically someone telling them what to think. They didn't understand the topics, they didn't know anything other than what they were told to say. He started to accuse me of only believing what I read, what I was told in my ""liberal"" college. I had to give a contrast - I've *done* these things, and I *know* about them because not only was I there, but I *understand* what's going on and the reasons for what I observed.

It's not that he didn't have the experiences, but that he didn't *care* about experience, only that someone he trusted (for whatever reason) told him things that were manifestly not true, and he would have thought that professors telling me the opposite was just ""opinion"", and worth as much or less than what he was told. The contrast of experience vs. church lecture is what I was going for, and it worked rather well.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I was personally disappointed in how fragile the necro pets are/were. They seem to get flattened as quickly as they are summoned even in PvE.  I kinda wanted to play a minion master but having one or two basic mobs wipe all your pets every time is kind of boring.  So I switched it up and started using wells and signets which was much more satisfying but not really what I wanted to do going into the class initially.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","This is pretty normal, OP. 

Many of us like to feel we are moving on after a breakup. In order to move on, you have to move on from something, so our psyche's kind of reference the old relationship, and the old lover, as fixed in time and space. Even if he hadn't been an asshat, and you had left him for reasons of incompatibility, you'd probably still feel a pang if, instead of him wallowing in your loss, he suddenly found a wonderful world with someone else.

That's why you are thinking about his impending marriage in contrast to your status. It looks to you like he's better than when with you, or at least, like he's further ahead. How can you be moving on if ""on"" has actually passed you? His status as engaged picks at your need to feel you made the right choice and are going in the right direction.

The cure comes in two parts. First, make sure you stop any FB lurking or any source of info about him. Cut all info about him off, and stick to it. 

Second, realize that you are actually well ahead of him. His new gf suspects he's cheating. Given his past record, that's not a good sign. And her suspicions aren't a good basis for a marriage. The chances are high that if he does marry, it will fall apart, because he's either cheating again, or his emotional connection with his fiancee is so poor that trust isn't part of the union they are about to enter into. This guy really isn't a winner, and you made the right choice, dodging a bullet, by breaking up AND having to sue him.

You made the right choice, and are going in the right direction. He is on a turntable, going round and round and round and ....

You get the idea.","1335832261"

"Tweakers","t5_2u0gb","Here is my kinda simple CWE process. You need 3 regular size dixie-cups. A rubber band. Coffee filter. Cold water. First, drop your powdered drugs into Cup A. Then add roughly 7-8oz of icy cold water to cover the drugs. Stir well. Now take Cup B and cut the bottom out, leaving you with a cone shaped tube. Now attatch the coffee filter to the small end of Cup B with the rubber band. After a little more stirring, slowly pour Cup A through Cup B, so it lands into Cup C. Your water/drugs mix will pass through the coffee filter slowly. Gently agitate and help it pass through being super careful to not tear the filter. Once most of it has gone through the filter, very carefully remove the filter from Cup B and squeeze the rest of the moisture out into Cup C.


**Disclaimer:** This is a very casual and lazy CWE and will only remove like -/+25% of the adulterants at best. For best results, start by mixing the addy with warm water, and let it cool down in the freezer/refridgerator before filtering.","1335832262"

Getting vital signs was great experience. I didn't realize just how much patients vary in terms of their arm size. Getting vital signs for some patients was really difficult.

I had High School kids throw Nutella sandwiches and PB candy at me because they wanted to see ""how long I could survive"" or ""If I was faking my allergy"". The best one was when people told me they actually wanted me to die. Nice kids, huh?
It only stopped when I ate somewhere else, and even then I had kids leave face down PB sandwiches on my desk.
I'm sure people still have this problem.

When people can respect allergies, then they can eat the allergens. 

EDIT: Before I get a comment debating the fact they don't know anyone who does that, I will clarify that even if you don't get PB/nut stuff thrown at you, it's a known fact that HS and Elementary kids aren't the most cleanly people. The residue is going to end up not being cleaned up.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","To begin, I think you aren't giving Plato much credit. The abstract physics concepts you study look an awful lot like ideal forms (especially those fancy multi-dimensional models I've seen of gravitational bodies warping space around them). Keep in mind I'm no metaphysician, but in the Republic Plato was advocating for the development of planar geometry in order to advance human knowledge. I'm pretty sure the only science he had available to him was geometry and so he adopted as much of it as he could in formulating his philosophy. 
As to what use Plato's works have in the contemporary era, I'm of the belief that a healthy dose of his and Aristotle's teaching on habit acquisition, the purpose of education, the need for criticism of one's culture and a host of other themes are very much still important in our day. 

Are a good many of his philosophic concepts outdated? Sure. Are some of his scientific understandings downright ludicrous? Yes. I just don't think philosophers become eclipsed; their teachings become the bedrock of culture for the coming generations. I'm just not convinced we learn nothing useful by reading older texts.

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","Yes, that is one of many reasons that most surface light rail was dismantled. While that is a real reason, it was far from the only reason. 

* Most cities still required rail companies to pay for the maintenance of their own system despite having to now share it with cars, giving cars free roads while increasing the need for maintenance on the part of tram companies as ware increases from car usage.
* The popularity and convenience of 5 cent ridership had placed many tram companies in poor financial positions as inflation eat into their profits even prior to the Depression.
* From the start of the Great Depression till the end of the war, virtually no updating or maintenance was done on any system, leaving them all outdated, expensive, antiquated and in bad need up major repairs.
* The post war prosperity allowed for millions of new car buyers in a matter of years leading to plummeting ridership.
* With millions more cars on the road, leaving two lanes reserved for street cars was deemed an expensive use of limited road space. Once cars shared the road with trams they began to get stuck in the same traffic jams as the cars, leading to exceedingly slow service. It made them no faster than buses would be and made cars faster than either of them because drivers didn't have to adhere to timetables or wait to transfer between lines.
* Changes in diesel technology from the 20s to the 40s meant that buses were much more economical to a degree they weren't prior to the Great Depression.
* Increased oil production, originally for the war, lead to very low fuel costs after the war and throughout most of the 50s and 60s. In the same time the price of electricity that trams relied on stayed level or increased.
* Culturally, street cars were seen as the past, part of the Depression and the war, while cars and highways being the future.
* City planners of the time thought the way to a good city was an ordered city with single use neighborhoods rather than the clutter of ""traditional"" multi-use neighborhoods. This lead to almost all new construction of the post-war boom to be built as single use land requiring long trips between homes, commercial centers and industry, something the tram network wasn't built to accommodate and something it would be slower at doing than cars on a highway would be.
* Unlike Europe, the US did not have the same shortages of land that Europe had, allowing for the new housing of the post war boom to be built at much lower density making the building of new tram lines uneconomical.

So hate on GM and Firestone all you like, but if they never lifted a finger all the other economic realities and cultural preferences of the time would mean that most surface rail would have been torn up anyways, and that includes LA.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","From the perspective of somebody who generally only goes PvE:

I found the questing progression to be really bad.  I was playing a Charr Engineer and the ""story"" quests were so boring.  WoW's quests are works of art in comparison.  The public quests were neat, but instead of ""get me 20 goat furs"" with some flimsy pretense it's ""get me 20 goat furs, or pick 20 tulips, or mow 20 lawns"" with no pretense.  I did really like that there was no kill stealing though. 

The combat at lower levels leaves a lot to be desired.  It wasn't advantageous to do anything but auto-attack most of the time.  I understand that if you swap weapons things get more interesting but I couldn't figure out where to buy a new weapon and I didn't have another one drop.

The dynamic events were kind of a clusterfuck due to the number of people on the servers.

The game ran very poorly on my system.  I don't have a beast of a machine but it's not terrible either.

That being said:

I can see huge potential for the combat. I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt since I didn't level up very far.  I'm not going to cancel my preorder, but I don't think GW2 will revolutionize the MMO.","1335832288"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You're asking a very big question. At different times in its history, Africa did have civilizations that were more advanced than contemporary civilizations in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. I don't really know why Western Europe eventually overtook Asia and Africa in the 17th-21st centuries, but it probably has to do with its access to water routes, its relatively cognizable sense of geography, and its access to natural resources. This helped Western Europe and its successor colonies to divide up and subjugate Africa to suit their own selfish interests, which largely accounts for Africa's current problems.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Indeed, although I would put the critiques of the historians you mention under the category of those who pick at the details of Foucault's work. And sure, there are problems with it. However, the doesn't diminish his theoretical insights. 

I would wonder how the historians you mention would respond to the works of [Bernard Cohn](http://books.google.com/books/about/Colonialism_and_Its_Forms_of_Knowledge.html?id=uIalYaenrTkC) or [Nicholas Dirks](http://books.google.com/books/about/Castes_of_Mind.html?id=lekITKy2rd4C), which seem to me to be productive applications of Foucault's insights to South Asia. 

Edit: Replying to your edit:

Consider how he closes *The History of Sexuality*. We have this long discussion of sexuality as a discourse, and the whole idea behind a discourse is that the operation of power in history cannot be seen at the level of the individual. In other words, that power operates less through people making choices than in the way that the discourse creates certain choices. 

And yet, at the end of that book, he basically says that it was all the bourgeoisie. He falls back to a class-based analysis, the underlying assumption of which is that people react to economic stimuli in basically rational ways. It felt like a cop-out. 

This, I would say, is the real limitation of Foucault: not that he's somehow sloppy, but that the idea of the discourse itself has limits, despite its real utility in many ways. So, to me, Foucault is important for his insights into the idea of discourse and the implications for the study of history, but in a way that opens up more questions than he answers. Which is a good thing.","1335832294"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","An argument from silence cannot, in itself, succeed; it's a part of the mythicist argument, but not something upon which it can actually rest.  However, it isn't something that can be ignored, either.  There may be very good reasons why we don't have the evidence that would support a historical Jesus, but that doesn't let us ignore that *we don't have it*, or the implications of that.  

What needs to support the argument from silence is an argument to best explanation; what hypothesis best fits the evidence we *do* have?  And there are significant problems with the standard historicist hypothesis, which are not present in a hypothesis such as that proposed by Earl Doherty that presents Christianity as a mystical-revelatory religion drawing on mythemes that were common at the time.  There *is* a lot of information available from the 1st century, contrary to what apologists would have you believe.

&gt;""The Lord's brother"" as a cultic title? Lost, no other document except Paul.

Except that we don't need them to determine that; Paul *is* a valid source for the traditions of early Christianity, and the evidence from his documents strongly supports the use of ""brother"" as a term applied to Christians in general (Philm. 1:1, 1 Thess. 3:2, Philp. 2:25, 2 Cor. 2:13 and 1:1, 1 Cor. 16:12 and 1:1, Romans 16:23).  And it's also in Hebrews 2:10-18, not a Pauline document.

&gt;Copies of Josephus without the supposedly forged passages? Lost, too.

[What survives](http://vridar.wordpress.com/2009/03/06/josephus/), though, are the works of people who *cited* Josephus.  Theophilus, Patriarch of Antioch wrote lengthy polemics in the 170s against pagan refusal to believe in Christianity. No reference to Jesus in Josephus, although he cites Josephus in his *Apology to Autolycus*, Bk 3, ch. 23.  Clement of Alexandria wrote extensively in defence of Christianity against pagan hostility in the 190s. He knew Josephus’ works — see *Stromata* Book 1 Chater 21. No reference to any mention of Jesus by Josephus.  Tertullian wrote lengthy apolegetics against unbelief and in justification of Christianity in the 200s. No reference to a passage about Jesus by Josephus. But he elsewhere knows Josephus’ works — see *Apologeticum* ch.19.  Very importantly, Origen knew and cited Josephus several times in the 230s, and indeed complains that Josephus **didn't believe in Jesus**, but doesn't cite the Testimonium in which Josephus supposedly speaks of Jesus in glowing terms.  And Eusebius, the first guy who *does* cite the Testimonium (and, notably, entitled the 32nd Chapter of his 12th Book of Evangelical Preparation: ""How it may be Lawful and Fitting to use Falsehood as a Medicine, and for the Benefit of those who Want to be Deceived"") inherited his library, and his copy of Josephus' work, in large part from Origen.

If Wellspring goes 5-0 and Seneca goes 6-0 then that simply means that Wellspring and Seneca are the best teams of their conference and nothing else. How would you rank the difference with a team like Deorne that is easy to beat. :-) And Lothos as such a good competitor in each conference.

How would we adjust since Seneca might have had 5 push over teams to play against or they might have been the best 5 opponents, you just don't know. So Seneca could br the best team in the league or the 6th best. 

I think you simply take the best 3 teams from each conference and use the conference as a way to widdle (sp?) the teams down. So if Wellspring is 5-0 and Seneca is 4-3 but they have the best record in their conference they are both on equal footing for the finals.","1335832302"

I think that's exceedingly unrealistic and unfair. The show is doing a damn good job of translating what works in a book into what will work on TV. It's just impossible to literally turn a book into a TV show. Certain liberties have to be made.

Read ""The Godfather"" novel and compare it to the movie. Or ""Lord of the Rings"" novels to the movies. Just because Tolkein found room to describe every single little hill's history that the Hobbits encounter doesn't mean that Peter Jackson felt it necessary to include those things. And he had to cut out some major sequences from ""Fellowship"" (Tom Bombadil, the Barrow-wights). But those changes were made for the better.

The show is doing exactly the same thing. Using Bronn as the commander of the gold cloaks is a brilliantly simple move at keeping the show streamlined. And it works.

Besides, if George R.R. Martin had any serious problems with any of the changes made, don't you think he'd say something and get the showmakers to reverse course?","1335832306"

"gopro","t5_2rvat","Your unique angle here is the sheer amount of people, so the main mount I'd get in addition to what you have is the tripod adaptor and a gorrilapod.

With that you can put the camera anywhere and get nice *stable* footage in addition to your other mounts- up trees, on the cliff-edge, canoe-gunnel... also essential for timelapse too.

I definately think you should get another few batteries (it would suck to run out in the first 2 hours!), and I'd get more cards: I use about 16GB per day!

Be careful with the suction-cup; I lost one to the deeps, so use a backup tether (eg string!)

Take the non-waterproof door too for camp stuff so you get better sound.

If you wanted to get really funky and more labor-intensive make a [cable-cam like this](http://maiamedia.co.uk/2012/03/how-to-gopro-diy-cable-cam/) (google has many more types)... you could get some great shots travelling high across the river, or zooming high across the campsite/fire. With canoes it doesn't have to be lightweight either!

Consider grabbing a digital voice recorder: if you got the cash go for a Zoom H2n, otherwise borrow whatever you can find... recording some sound-bytes of conversation would layer nicely over some of the footage for interest (kids and old-people talk the easiest!)

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Personally, I'd say -if- you can still get your hands on an X4 960, it's absolutely not a bad choice against the I3.

Every-single-one of them that I've run into has unlocked into a 6 core beast. Even if it doesn't, the 4 core can hold it's own with the I3 in almost any metric you care to throw out there. 

The I3 might hit a slightly higher framerate stock-vs-stock, but we're talking about FPS that's almost certainly above what this person's monitor can even display, so it's irrelevant. Plus, the 960T overclocks (the I3 doesn't), putting it even or even exceeding the performance of the I3.

So, 960T = blazingly fast, affordable, 4 core (and often a 6 core waiting for you to unlock). 

You won't really feel bad either way you go, but man, you'll -love- how you feel if you grab that 960T and it opens up to a 6 core overclocked behemoth :).

A word of warning though - if you go for the 960T make SURE you have a motherboard that can handle a 125watt processor. That 960 gets THIRSTY when you unlock and overclock her :). A 95 watt board will work with the 960t, but unlocked it will not function without that extra wattage.","1335832316"

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Copypasta from a comment I made a few days ago:

The private prison industry, though sick, only holds around 8-9% of the prison population in the U.S. [Sauce](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/06/30/how-the-recession-hurts-private-prisons.html)

Corporations certainly benefit (think who supplies food, toiletries, etc. for all these prisons), but blaming the corporations is oversimplification.
 
Prison, depending on who you believe, is intended for a few different purposes. First, the incarceration rate of minorities is inexcusable. The incarceration rate of the U.S. for whites alone is 3 times higher than most Western European nations [Source 1](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/raceinc.html) and [Source 2](http://www.prisonstudies.org/publications/list/40-world-prison-population-list-8th-edition.html), but black men are incarcerated at a rate 7 times that of white men [Source](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p10.pdf).

Michel Foucault believes the reason for this is establishing a delinquency model. We have no interest in rehabilitation, but we make minorities delinquents in order to control. We incarcerate them to incapacitate them. Our government redefined crime through the War on Drugs to control a potentially dangerous minority population. We put them in prison to keep them in government control, we parole and put them on probation to keep an eye on their activities, we take away felons votes to keep them from influencing decisions in government, we slash prison education funding, and we make them likely to return by keeping a public record of their criminal activities so they can't get a decent job [Source](http://www.storesonlinepro.com/files/3483016/uploaded/3088944-TheImpactofIncarcerationonWageMobilityandInequality.pdf). The War on Drugs exists to manipulate minorities. The crack vs. cocaine sentencing laws (the former a drug for poor blacks and the latter for rich whites) were 100-1 in length of mandatory minimum sentence until just a few months ago. They are now 18-1. [Source](http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-01/justice/justice_crack-cocaine-sentencing_1_powder-cocaine-fair-sentencing-act-crack-penalties?_s=PM:JUSTICE)

I could go on about the effects of mandatory minimums and the three strike laws and their racist effects, plus prison labor, plus the horrible recidivism rate, *ad nauseum*, but corporations are a side-beneficiary of the prison system. Control is the primary motivation.

Also, as a note, if one reads [Discipline and Punish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish), Foucault doesn't talk about minorities but of the prison system as a normalizing force in general. However, I think it's a pretty clear connection to the normalization and control of minorities.

The article continuously references people with high BMI as obese and overweight.  The system is dated and obscenely inaccurate.  I'm obese according to BMI, but have less than 20% body fat.  The author needs to account for numbers based on percent body fat instead, and I assert that they'll find a different story is told.

Another shortcoming, they show their operations, but not how they obtained the base numbers.  

""Even when poor health doesn't keep obese workers home, it can cut into productivity, as they grapple with pain or shortness of breath or other obstacles to working all-out. Such obesity-related ""presenteeism,"" said Finkelstein, is also expensive. The very obese lose one month of productive work per year, costing employers an average of $3,792 per very obese male worker and $3,037 per female. Total annual cost of presenteeism due to obesity: $30 billion.""

How did they find the one month of lost productive work?  It seems seriously dubious to suggest an overweight office worker is burning through a productive month each year.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; It boils down to the meaning of life. Is the best life the one with the most “life experiences,” the most thrills per minute, the most shipwreck scuba dives and jungle zip line runs? Or is it one where you slowly build something over a long time — and when circumstances make that impossible, refuse to be ignored until that changes?

I don't think it's an either-or proposition. I'm 26, at 18 countries visited so far with 3 more on deck for this year, and I've done so while developing a fairly solid career. I haven't visited these countries with a desire to ""help"" people so I can assuage my liberal guilt. I've visited these countries to get a taste of the local culture and hopefully develop a more nuanced understanding of how the world works. 

Jetting off for months at a time is an unwise approach to career development, but with sensible budgeting it's not unreasonable to take a week to visit a new country 2 or 3 times a year. If you have a job that lets you work remotely, there's even less excuse not to get out there. The trick is balancing the mundane but essential with the exhilarating but frivolous.","1335832338"

**By Age Five,** children need to know:

- That love should make people feel good, safe, and wanted
- That people's bodies are different sizes, shapes, and colors
- How the bodies of girls and women are different from the bodies of boys and men
- Their bodies belong to themselves
- The correct name of all body parts, including sex and reproductive organs
- How to talk about their sexual parts without feeling naughty
- That it's normal to touch one's sex organs for pleasure
- To seek privacy when touching one's sex organs for pleasure
- How a ""baby"" ""gets in"" and ""gets out"" of a woman's body
- That a woman does not have to have a baby unless she wants to
- How to talk with trusted adults about sexual issues, questions and concerns
- How to say ""no"" to unwanted touch

**By Ages 5 - 7,** children need to know:

- That all living things reproduce
- How plants and animals grow and reproduce, what they need, and how we care for them
- That all people, including parents and grandparents, are sexual
- That we all live through a life cycle that has a beginning and an end and includes sexuality at all ages
- That people experience sexual pleasure in a number of different ways
- That everyone has sexual thoughts and fantasies and that having them is normal
- That families are structured in different ways
- That sexual identity includes sexual orientation
- That we must take an active role in protecting our health
- That health care providers support our health and well-being
- The basic facts about HIV/AIDS
- That a friend is someone who we enjoy being with, who shares, listens, encourages, and helps us think through our problems
- How to live outside stereotyped gender roles
- How to recognize ad protect themselves from potential sexual abuse-- for example, that predators may seem kind, giving, and loving.  They may be family or friends.","1335832339"

Honestly, people like that are often manipulative and used to getting their way.

Things to keep in mind:

- This is probably fake

- There is no evidence provided that they had unprotected sex or that she gave it to him, it's actually difficult to give it to a man through heterosexual vaginal sex.

- If they were dating for 5 years it's likely that she found out about this very recently or that he's very dumb. You need to take a lot of medication and go to the doctor often. Knowing she was sick and seeing her taking that many pills should be two different things. One might ask before you get married what this chronic illness is. This makes the story less plausible.

And BtVS wasn't above deus ex machina. At the end of the series, Buffy finds a magical scythe that makes short order of her worst enemies.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","While I was on vacation with my family I learned that my girlfriend of 9 hears had had a baby (I was 22, she was 23). Which was ... a bit of a shock, because she had managed to hide the pregnancy from both of our families. I have no idea how - the baby came out healthy and a normal size - or how she thought she'd get away with it. But that's beside the point. Suffice it to say that we freaked the fuck out and I caught an early flight home, where I panicked in the hospital room and basically signed all the paperwork I had thrown at me - including a declination to pursue a paternity test. Oops.

Fast-forward a couple of months, during which I've not only taken double shifts at the shoe store where I worked to try to pay for both my education and my new daughter's every need but also discovered that my girlfriend has been getting voice mails from a (married) former coworker of her's (talking about how he loves her) and that she took out a PO box for him (supposedly because his family reads his mail), and she's disappeared once for several hours only to later say she ""fell asleep in the mall parking lot"" (with the baby in the car, mind you). Along the way, despite my protestation that there *must* be some rational explanation for all this nonsense, because I wanted very badly for this baby to be mine, my parents convinced me to do an at-home paternity test (ironically enough, from the same company that [Maury Povich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt2i0ts-uck) uses).

While they're off on vacation (a cruise on the Mediterranean), I get the results in the mail. There is a 0% chance of paternity. I am not ""my"" daughter's father.

I can understand your coworker's reaction. After this news I was so depressed that I stopped going to work for several weeks. When my boss found out about it, she was understanding but still had to let me go. It was a really dark time in my life and I don't wish it upon anyone.","1335832349"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I can think of three cases I've heard of in the news about babies that died as a result of accidental smothering, by the mother. 

Dr. Sears posted an article on his website that actually supports that nurses claims, stating that the mother has a natural ability that a father does not have which would make her less likely to roll onto her baby. In fact i think that the problem many people had with this, is that it was lacking the genuine research you asked about. It's crap. 

Maybe some (or even most) mothers are more attentive to babies than some dads, but this is ***hardly*** a rule. It is an offensive claim and I believe it was made mostly to boost sales of the co-sleeper he endorses. Every mom and every dad and every baby is different. The problem with outrageous claims such as these is that parents can misunderstand things as absolute. 

Co-sleeping can can be beneficial to parents and baby if done safely. Look up co-sleeping and I'm sure you'll find research that outlines both benefits and risks. 

Edit: [Here's the post about the Dr Sears article.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/strue/dr_sears_addresses_recent_cosleeping_concerns_ask/) I think you'll find the comments more useful than the actual article.

M50 - more bass

SR850 - superior sound stage, more comfortable 

I'll need to listen more, but I'm really liking the sr850. I can't tell yet which is more clear and these headphones need some burn in. I might prefer the sr850 because the sound stage is quite good. I think the m50 might be a tinge more clear at the highs, however this is something I expect to clear up with burn in. 

Edit: first night impressions

The Samson are really good, music is airy and bright. Bass is pretty ample and music is clear. I still prefer the sound of the M50 for most songs. For some rock songs, the Samson seems to be a little weak for the bass lines. Interestingly, I didn't notice this as much with electronica. Also, the Samson seems to be slightly harder to drive, as there was a slight quality increase when using my Iphone(good DAC) vs my tablet(mediocre DAC).

The M50 sounds better to me, but, does it sound 100 dollars better? I'm not so sure on that. If a semi-open headphone sounds like the right solution you should check out the Samson SR850.","1335832355"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","We're all born asexual. You don't get 1 year olds hitting on other 1 year olds (except when they imitate the actions of older people). Our sexuality is formed during puberty but whatever forms is likely predetermined at birth. The cause for different sexuality has not been pinned down.

Nobody wakes up in the morning and decides ""I think, starting from today, I will become one of the most hated minorities in the world so that I can have people like whitelotus despise me"". Even in countries where homosexuality is given the DEATH PENALTY there is still a similar proportion of homosexuals. We are not 'bullshitting' you, we are telling the facts as they are.

If the penis is only meant to go in the vagina, then why is stimulation of the prostate gland, accessed via the anus, the male equivalent of the g-spot? I guess that if the penis is only supposed to go there, we should also discriminate against those who enjoy oral sex or even those who masturbate.

Naturally: Nothing is nothing and nothing happens to nothing. Nature does not have sentience, therefore, nothing can go against nature and nothing can go for nature. Along with this, unnatural does not mean bad and natural does not mean good. Deadly nightshade is natural but it is, as its name states, quite deadly. The computer you are typing on is unnatural but it is generally a good invention with many beneficial uses.

Homosexuality and bisexuality have been observed in over 500 species, while discrimination towards homosexuals has only been observed in 1. What seems more unnatural by your line of reasoning now? Even within our own species history, there has been times when Homosexuality and/or bisexuality were considered the norm.

The perfect person for a partner is the person that fits their sexuality. Most homosexuals would share similar dislike at the thought of dating the opposite sex as you would at the thought of dating the same sex. Along with this, the concept of true love is different for everyone, so forcing a defined set of conditions for it is stupid.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt; He strikes me as a man thoroughly convinced his actions are never wrong.

Which makes me confused as to why you picked his apology apart the way you did.  What else could you expect from someone forced to make an apology, someone who still thought they were in the right?  How can you muster up rage against someone who doesn't even know sexual harassment *exists*, much less understood what those two words meant?  When I went over that interview again in light of what he said in his apology, it gave an entirely different light to the conversation.

Go back to his original comments in that interview, pretend the entire debacle hadn't happened yet, and just look at some of the things he was saying to Rea.  Over and over, Aris made comments like ""You're trying to turn [fighting games] into something they're not, and are never going to be.""  This doesn't sound like someone trying to explain their position, it sounds like a defensive child who feels under attack.  Think about it from Aris's position.  This important member of a service you feel is so vital to your hobby is unhappy with some of the things you're saying.  And to Aris, remember, sexual harassment is ""just jokes"", equal to telling someone to go back to their console, or calling them a nooblet.  Yes, he realizes that some ""jokes"" make fun of sex while others make fun of skill, but to him *they're interchangeable*.

Another telling comment is his frequent referrals to SC2 as ""what [Rea] wants to happen"".  Remember, most of this trash talking he sees in fighting games are done between players, during games.  And it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine that, considering how little conversation **isn't** some form of joke, insult, or put-down, Aris sees this trash talking as *the* form of communication between players.  Compare this to SC2, where there's a customary ""good luck have fun"" at the start of the game, and very rarely, a few lines exchanged in the beginning, other than the standard ""gg"" exchange before someone surrenders.   So why is Aris claiming that removing sexual harassment would make the Street Fighter community identical to Starcraft 2's?  To actually do that, you'd have to remove nearly **all** communication from fighting games. 

So what do the relevant parts of the interview look like in Aris's eyes? Let me make an attempt:

&gt; Rea: Can I get my Street Fighter without [trash talking]?

&gt; Bakhtanians: You can't. You can't because they're one and the same thing. This is a community that's, you know, 15 or 20 years old, and the [immature jokes are] part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community--it's StarCraft... That would be like someone from the fighting game community going over to StarCraft and trying to say ""hey, StarCraft, you guys are too soft, let's start [insulting our opponent's skill] to each other on StarCraft."" That's not cool, people wouldn't like that. StarCraft isn't like that. People would get defensive, and that's what you're trying to do the fighting game community, and it's not right. It's ethically wrong.

&gt; Rea: When I go to SoCal regionals and I see a Phoenix [from Marvel vs. Capcom 3] on main stage getting blown up and there's some dude in the audience just yelling ""Bitch! Bitch!"" every time she gets hit and then she's killed and he goes ""Yeah, rape that bitch!"" Yeah, that's totally acceptable! Really? Really? You're going to tell me that's acceptable?

&gt; Bakhtanians: Look, man. What is unacceptable about [someone talking trash]? There's nothing unacceptable about that. These are people, we're in America, man, this isn't North Korea. We can say what we want. People get emotional. 

I can actually follow Aris's line of thinking now, even if I don't agree with it.  The guy was under the impression the entire community was under attack.  To him, the communication between players is the lifeblood of the sport, and Rea wanted to take that away.  His apology makes perfect sense with that interpretation, even the reference to arguing with a girlfriend.  *Of course* Aris thought he was right.  He grew up with the constant cajoling and heckling during a game. He wasn't defending sexism, he was trying to preserve what he thought was the core to the competitive nature of fighting games.   In his mind he was a hero, fighting against the dangers of censorship.  He didn't feel the need to apologize to Miranda, his apology was for going too far in defending his sport from Rea.  Why would he think he was responsible for Pakozdi's resignation?  If you played fighting games like she did, you'd know they're just jokes.  In the interview, he tried to make the distinction between racists who commit hate crimes, and people with friends of all colors who happen to make comments that sound racist once in a while.  He did that *because he thought he was the latter*.  In his world, if you call someone (male or female) a ""bitch"" and just mean a player who isn't very good, or were using it interchangeably with ""fucker"", ""noob"", ""cheater"", or the like, you're not committing a hate crime.  It's just the banter between players, one of the psychological aspects of the game that compliments the technical.  The entire apology sounds like an incredulous ""What's the big deal, guys?""

&gt; Okay, I've written way too much already, so I'll wrap it up.  

&gt; TL;DR: READ BELOW THIS LINE
___

The entire time I wrote this, I was wrestling with two questions:  Why am I defending this guy?  I had this weird feeling like I was white-knighting for the wrong team, that I was siding with the inexcusable.  Furthermore, why does it matter what his reasoning is?  I think we can all agree that we don't want sexual harassment in our games, who cares whether Aris was a hero in his own mind or reveling in emotionally scarring this woman?  But as I continued, I realized that I wanted to defend him.  And if you'll allow me to get all preachy and try to sum up my thoughts on the big picture... He deserved to be defended.  It feels like too often, we denizens of the internet are quick to side with one of two extremes.  Images are only ""epic"" or ""fail"".  Someone is only a ""genius"" or a ""dickwad"".  Things like SRS take the extremes to the extremes, you're either a supreme being of gender equality, or lowlife overprivileged scum.  Everything, even reddit, keeps on getting boiled down to ""you're with us, or you're against us.""  

And what's worse, once this binary categorization is made, if someone is weighed and found wanting, they're summarily ignored.  If you're not a part of the ""Fempire"", you're benned.  If you don't agree with my view of feminism, you're a concern troll.  If you don't like the things I like, you're not worth my time.  Everything is filtered, everything is personalized. I mean, look at it.  The top comment here is talking about being the same kind of person he was to Miranda, because he's a misogynist, so taunting him is fair game.  Of course scumbags don't deserve to be defended.

But real life isn't video games.  Problems are complex, there's more than just two opposite sides.  People aren't divine or demonic, they're human.  We've seen a scant few hours of this man's life, and we feel fit to judge his entire worth as a person?  No.  I abstain.  If given the chance, I'd take as much time as I could to discuss what happened and try to understand why he said what he did, and find a way to show him where his view of the world is wrong, but I'm not going to be the one to declare him beyond saving and throw the first stone.  There's more to this than just claiming he's a misogynistic douchebag and heaping insults on him, that solves nothing.

&gt; **TL;DR TO THE TL;DR:** Just like in this story, in real life almost any villain you meet is simply a misguided hero fighting for the wrong side.","1335832359"

a) claims that the Federal Reserve is necessary (loose non-sequitur) because of a loose definition of money

idiotic non-sequitur...

b) claims the market caused the Great Depression

not true...&gt;60% inflation caused by the Fed during the 1920-1929 period, which led to the impeachment of Andrew Mellon...

c) claims he is not a supporter of Diocletian's policies (funny, i've been talking about this for a while...)

also false, Krugman is an inflationista just like Diocletian...

d) claims that the policies after WWII helped the economy

relative to the policies in WWII, sure, but all the debt incurred after WWII was just starting to gain interest. relative governmental *non* interference commenced after WWII, until it picked up again in the Korean war, and more dramatically in the Nixon era...

e) claims Milton Friedman said the FR didn't do enough during the Depression

Friedman's explanation of the Depression differs significantly from the Austrian School explanation, in that it mostly fails to account for the deleterious effects of the massive inflation the Fed had created in the previous decade, which laid the groundwork for the huge rise in speculation, although he correctly identified the dangers of high speculation.  the government's attempts to mitigate the losses of private banks - something Friedman recommended- were actually extremely corrupt, such as the efforts of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation...the actual history here is lost on a lot of people, especially the Krugmans of the world.

f) claims ignorance on laws limiting currency competition, claims that lack of monetary competition is not enforcing primacy of the dollar

extremely obvious why this is false.  a relative lack of exchange value of a currency discourages its use, and exchange value decreases when exchanges are taxed.

g) claims repurchase agreements (uses word ""repo"" apparently just to confuse people - although to be fair, this is on ""Bloomberg"") are a form of private money, the inflation of which caused the current crisis

nothing to do with the Fed-caused housing bubble you advocated in ""Dubya's Double Dip"", right Krugman?  

no, according to you, the problem is the trade of repurchase agreements, in which someone selling a security agrees to sell a mortgage and then buy it back at a later date?    why would the market spontaneously andartificially inflate the value of these agreements?  

total B.S.

h) claims increased debt will get us out of an economic slump (~10:50)

how is an increased *debt burden* supposed to promote economic stability, prosperity, or a higher standard of living?   it reduces the ability of all people - except the profiteers of government debt - to benefit from economic activity.  it has the exact opposite effect.

i) ""not even close to a red line""

&gt; 200 billion/yr in interest payments on the national debt is not enough for Krugman?

j) claims that cutting spending increases the debt problem

false in every way, including his ""workaround explanation"" that government spending promotes economic stability.  relies on the false theory of preferability of government spending over private spending.  currently, spending by the government also directly creates debt.  this one is a career-ender.

&gt; says ""my proposal is to actually destroy the economy so that we can't, in fact, afford to carry the debt we already have"" (~11:25)

that's for sure...

&gt;  claims ""i believe in freedom and markets""

and somehow, you have no problem reconciling this belief with the idea that ""fiscal stimulus"" is better for the economy than what the private market would have done with that money?

* Performance issues (will be resolved, in all likelihood)
* Dull/nonexistent chat (probably because everyone's trying to do as much as possible as quickly as possible)
* Combat with certain weapons is stale due to long cooldowns; you only really use your autoattack because the other skills are either underwhelming, have massive cooldowns, or are extremely situational.  I think many utility skills suffer from excessive cooldowns as well.
* Some dynamic events lost their feeling of impact when the same thing happened 3 minutes later.  For instance, I repel a group of Krait from attacking a village, then rescue the slaves they did take.  3 minutes later, they're attacking the village again.  Same thing happens with centaurs and contestable locations.  I'm not sure how to tweak this system so that everyone gets a turn at the dynamic events, but to me it felt like my efforts kind of lost their impact for certain events.","1335832371"

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","From the wikipedia article regarding [abortion and mental health](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_and_mental_health), the results of the research [emphasis mine]:

&gt;The relationship between induced abortion and mental health is an area of political controversy.[1][2] **Expert groups have found no scientific evidence of a causal relationship between abortion and poor mental health**. For women with unplanned pregnancies, the risk of mental-health problems is equal whether they carry the pregnancy to term or undergo an abortion.[3][4][5] Pre-existing factors in a woman's life, such as emotional attachment to the pregnancy, lack of social support, pre-existing psychiatric illness, and **conservative views on abortion increase the likelihood of experiencing negative feelings after an abortion**.[6][7][8]

&gt;In 1990, the American Psychological Association (APA) found that ""severe negative reactions [after abortion] are rare and are in line with those following other normal life stresses.""[9] The APA updated its findings in August 2008 to account for new evidence, and again concluded that termination of a first unplanned pregnancy did not increase the risk of mental-health problems. The data for multiple abortions were more equivocal, as the same factors that predispose a woman to multiple unwanted pregnancies may also predispose her to mental health difficulties.[3][10] **A 2008 systematic review of the medical literature on abortion and mental health found that high-quality studies consistently showed few or no mental-health consequences of abortion, while poor-quality studies were more likely to report negative consequences.**[4] In December 2011, the U.K. National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health published a systematic review of available evidence, similarly concluding that abortion did not increase the risk of mental-health problems.[5][11]

&gt;**Despite the weight of medical opinion on the subject, some pro-life advocacy groups have continued to allege a link between abortion and mental-health problems.**[12] Some pro-life groups have used the term ""post-abortion syndrome"" to refer to negative psychological effects which they attribute to abortion. However, ""post-abortion syndrome"" is not recognized as an actual syndrome by any medical or psychological organization,[13] and physicians and pro-choice advocates have argued that the effort to popularize the idea of a ""post-abortion syndrome"" is a tactic used by pro-life advocates for political purposes.[1][14][12][15] Some U.S. state legislatures have mandated that patients be told that abortion increases their risk of depression and suicide, despite the fact that such risks are not supported by the bulk of the scientific literature.[4][16]

They're too used to today's easy games that you steadily progress through.  Took about 70 hours to beat the game once. Didn't die much but I very tediously did some grinding when I needed to, inched into areas, never diving too deep into one region, etc.

The game is also built a lot like a series of puzzles.  Beating one area gets you a few items that helps with another area, that gives items that helps with the 2nd part of the first area, etc.

Also you need to be ready to only play a handful of hours a day if that's what it takes. Get stuck, take a break, come back later. I beat the thing about 3 months after it came out.","1335832373"

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Yeah you are right, I did assume a bit much there. But it's a pretty fundemental rule in game design by this point. Things get harder as you move on, harder content takes longer to clear. Unless the later acts are half as short as the first one then we can almost take it for granted that they will take longer to clear with the increased difficulty.

However, even if that isn't the case, dying more often (or the chance of dying more often) will certainly be a risk which is the largest factor in clearing fast. Ideally you will probably want to be skipping normal mobs and looking for champion packs + bosses, in which case you have to then factor in if it's possible to skip the majority of mobs without dying.","1335832376"

* Move Skream and Doctor P either way on the y axis. I'd say both are a bit light IMO.

You might want to look up this guy called Mortimer Adler. He also started outlining ways morals can be objective by defining what are the differences between human wants and needs and those which are needs can have morality tied to them. so since people need to eat to survive it is unmoral to not feed a starving person.

They kill people with chainsaws and machetes, they use torture and rape and slave labor to boost their bottom line, and because I like to feel relaxed and happy, I give them my money. It's easy to blame the federal and state governments for their ridiculous policies that, were they to allow more open markets in the United States, would make it easier to choose more humane growers and sellers.

BS

Aside from the way you cleverly made all small business owners Republicans, the fact is that businesses expand when there is increased demand, not when there is a surplus of income. It's true that increased demand may exist while an individual business owner does not have the capitol to expand, but that doesn't result in a net (opportunity) loss of jobs, someone else expands to meet the demand.","1335832403"
"Lehigh","t5_2rpp0","I would definitely recommend Molly's.  On the weekends it can be kind of crowded, but last I knew (last year) during the week, it was pretty quiet, but a popular place for grad students.  They have a wall full of craft beers that they offer, with a good number of them on tap.  

Funhouse, across the street, has good bands sometimes, but they're also a bit of a hole in the wall (in case that wasn't obvious).  They're cash only, but don't tend to be AS crowded as some other places, unless there's a popular band playing.

Personally, as far as renting goes, I would recommend not renting from Joe D'Ambrosio.  Some people have no problem with him, but he can be super misogynist and can just generally pick on women.  He also has no reservations against just outright screaming at you.  He also depends on his tenants to clean the houses when they move out, instead of having it cleaned professionally between tenants.  Overall, he just isn't a good landlord, in my opinion.

Finally, I would definitely recommend getting involved in activities on the South Side and in the Lehigh Valley as much as possible.  Maybe that sounds obvious, but I know in the 5 years that I was there, I really only discovered a lot of stuff the South Side and Lehigh Valley have to offer in my 5th year, and I completely regret it.  A good way to find out what the South Side has to offer is First Friday.  I think the majority of stuff going on is on Third Street, but there might be some stuff going on on Fourth Street as well.  To get involved with the Lehigh Valley, I would recommend looking up Lehigh Valley with Love.  He can be a little crass, and maybe a little odd sometimes, but he is pretty heavily involved with events across Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton and does a lot of organizing himself as well.","1335832403"

* [Horizon The Mondragon Experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMvktpKDmo) - Documentary made in 1980 about Mondragon.  Note one seen where it is mentioned that on leaving Mondragon after 20 years of work, it is not uncommon to receive 200k pounds from accumulated owner equity.  If you account for inflation from 1980 to today and translate that to dollars... $500k.  Also note that not many people are ""fired"".

When I tried it, the drink was expensive for what it was.... a cup of dirt that did not get me high. I smoked pot at the time so I figured there was no reason to blow money on cups of mud that weren't working (I never drank enough to get the effect I guess, it tastes like dirt...).

**HOWEVER**, the wait staff is incredible friendly and it is a really nice place to hang out. They had board games you can play and they also sold teas, which I quickly switched over to.

If you wish to persuade anyone that your beliefs are bible-based, please provide scriptural support for the following doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses:

 - Jesus is Michael the Archangel
 - A creative day is 7,000 years long
 - The ""appointed times of the nations"" are the same as the ""seven times"" that Nebuchadnezzar was to be mad
 - The tree that Daniel explicitly tells us represented Nebuchadnezzar, that was cut down and banded for seven years, actually represents the kingdom of Israel
 - The seven times are seven *years* of *days* of *years*
 - The resurrection of the dead on Earth will take place during the thousand years, and not after the thousand years have ended, just before the final judgement
 - Disfellowshipped ones are to be shunned by members of their own families, or their family members also face disfellowshipping
 - Eating with a disfellowshipped person is grounds for disfellowshipping
 - Celebrating a birthday is a disfellowshipping offense
 - Oral sex, even within the confines of marriage, is sinful, is a disfellowshipping offense, is grounds for divorce (or not, depending on the current decade)
 - The little flock are the anointed and the other sheep are the great crowd (and not the Jewish Christians and the Gentile Christians, respectively)
 - The 140,000 thousand are a literal number (despite being in a book filled with symbolic numbers), represent the anointed (rather than the martyrs), and will be in heaven forever, and not just for the thousand years they will rule
 - Only the anointed may partake of the emblems, despite Jesus saying that no one who did not eat his flesh and drink his blood could be saved
 - Jesus is a mediator only for the anointed
 - The Faithful and Discrete Slave are anointed Christians who are ""represented"" by the Governing Body, despite never actually being consulted by the Governing Body when making doctrinal changes

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","For dumbbells, absolutely. For barbells, it's a toss up.

I got a 300# olympic set at sports authority for $160. At the time my deadlift was ~100 and I was just starting SS. 2.5 months later and I have maxed out the bar on deadlift.

Got a deal on some used plates from craigslist, 50 cents/lb, bought 4 plates so total extra is $90.

I have probably spent ~150 on making myself a power rack and deadlift platform.

So all told, maybe $400 spread out over the course of 3 months. This has netted me 480 lbs of iron including the bar, a power rack, deadlift platform, and oh yeah I spent 50 on a flat bench on CL again. so 450.

I WANT to be able to DL 480 in a year but I don't think that's realistic. Won't stop me from trying, might take 2 years. it is definitely my highest lift so basically I spent $450 and am expecting 1-2 years out of it.

figure in another 1-200 on stupid shit I want like a belt and building a set of dip bars and we'll be in the ballpark of $600 over 2 years.

**300/year = $25 a month**

and that DIY power rack is going to last forever, and so are the weights. the bar is kinda crappy quality (just fine for a beginner though, which I am) so in a few years I might end up having to get a new one of those.

I figure if I start DLing more than 400 lbs I might join a gym anyway because of the fancy equipment and camaraderie (or something) but I like making stuff DIY and enjoy being able to just trot out to the garage for an hour at ANY TIME.

but there is always another piece of equipment that you want. mine is a giant tire.

There is no incentive for Radulov to perform as he knows that no matter what happens...he will be getting a large contract after this year is over.  

He's making $918K and that is NOT being prorated.  He gets his KHL salary AND his NHL salary.  You tell me what player in the NHL is worth 918K for a few playoff series.  If you put that in perspective...he should be compared to a guy making 8.5 million this year...because that's what it breaks down to if you do the math.

He was HARDLY dominant against the Wings.  That's ridiculous.  Even an unpolished diamond looks awesome when it's surrounded by shit.  Compared to every other team's leaders...he's mediocre at best.  His 6 points are a joke.  His lone goal was a garbage one-timer that not even Wayne Simmons could miss.  4 other points are second assists.  Brad Richards has 6 points and is a -1...but he's light years ahead of Radulov as far as hustle and skill are concerned.

People like YOU are so ready to jump in and defend a guy who has no cares in the world.  He's under-performing.  He could have easily done a lot more against the Red Wings...the Wings lost the series more than the Preds won it.  Phoenix is exposing them right now.  Radulov is a fraud and so are the Preds.  Rinne is the only reason the Preds have any shot right now.

FACT:
&gt;The next big step in Radulov’s return to the NHL was his contract with Nashville.  Although he still has a year left on his contract, the Predators only had (as of Tuesday) ten games remaining in the regular season, so they didn’t want to pay a full years contract for only about one eight of the season plus playoffs.  Ultimately, the Predators realized that it is not worth losing Radulov back to the KHL due to contractual disagreements, so they agreed to pay his full years contract, $984,420 for only ten games, plus he will get his playoff bonus when the playoffs start.  Who loves life more than Alexander Radulov right now?  He is the highest paid player in the KHL and is now getting an extra million or more dollars added on to his KHL money for only a small fraction of games.

Stop apologizing for a guy who is half-assing his way to a giant payday and a lucrative free-agency.  He should never have been allowed back into the NHL this year.  The league fucked up.

Someone who is not an armorer took the gun apart further than a field strip.  They removed the 2 main roll pins releasing the trigger spring and probably broke the small yellow spring inside that retains the take-down pin in the process.  The shit really gets real when you try to put that shit back together without a guide or previous experience and most likely the trigger spring was improperly re-installed, and the rails were not seated correctly.  This makes the trigger spring lay against the trigger bar and bind up action.  *I WAS THIS DUMB AND HAD THE SAME EXACT EXPERIENCE*

Long story short, S&amp;W customer service rocks and I sent it in for repair.  The smith working on it probably double face-palmed, brought the gun back in spec, polished the feed ramp and sent it back.  Runs perfectly now.","1335832430"

make sure you are buying the right stuff (hennaforhair is a great resource) and give yourself the time to get it done and you'll be pretty happy with the results. it's messy and takes hours to do but the results are completely worth it, imo. i would set up a 'me' day, and sit around while you have your head wrapped up and 'stewin' doing your nails, reading a book, redditing, etc. the smell can take some getting used to but... yeah. it's not really all that bad.

Everyone is totally entitled to their own personal opinion (wth?). When it's so easy to avoid and ignore people why fight ?

... Posting your position on a *debate forum* is not minding your own business.

You made claims and people have responded to them, in disagreement or otherwise; that's the way all communication works.

&gt;Would you say religious people are unable to utilise reason properly? 

Depends on the particular religious person, and the particular subject on the table. People exercise different levels of criticism on different subjects, depending on any number of factors.

&gt;I used the jailhouse ant example to demonstrate a point from the scriptures that I have faith in after study and practice and time.

Yes, and I asked for a reason to consider the thought more than mere imagination. If you're not prepared to do that, just concede and move on.

&gt;science is a search, and to use current discoveries and interpretation of them to support anything is a bit , well, premature. 

You (so very broadly) speak as though science is not reliable on the practical level. 

You are using science/technology to communicate with myself, whom you have never met in person.

&gt;Maybe have a look at those scriptures, Bhagavad-gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, Isa Upanisad.. 

I have some humble familiarity with Hindu scriptures, but I see no reason to accept a number of their views.

&gt;Why claim to know the answer to everything and how it all works

I don't know anyone who does that -- especially atheists.

&gt;and to use that platform to critique something you really haven't the slightest idea about?

This is more applicable to believers -- or at least the ones who espouse do's and do not do's using some god as their justification.

&gt;All you have is the behaviour of the people purporting to represent said Diety. 

You're right; that's all we have -- like *yourself*. Never witnessed any gods, only people claiming to know one and possibly speak for them.

&gt;But, I deeply regret the enmity.

That would probably be a lesser problem if it weren't for the wealth of historical (and even modern) condemnation, oppression by religious powers. ","1335832430"

TV has an entire advertising infrastructure fleshed out with pricing schemes, middle-men and third-party agents who comprise a complex but heavily refined eco-system.

I guess the assumption then is that, as an advertiser, you'd rather spend a TV dollar to get a dollar and a half back, than spending an ""internet"" dollar when you don't know what you're gonna get.

It might also be that TV world is run by people who, putting it bluntly, don't understand the internet, so they can't strategize around it. They might simply be scared shitless of cutting the one hand that feeds them.

"keto","t5_2rske","I always reuse my oil based off what was fried in it.  Whenever we have Tacos my wife frys the soft flour shells and folds them in the oil.  They come out crispy and fantastic like a gordita shell.  We just pour it back into a container (through a flour sifter/strainer).  
If you only have a little bit left and it's dirty then it won't kill ya to pitch it.  We only save it for $$$ reasons since it doesn't really go bad.

As for adding the Vanilla, that's a great idea!  Thank you for replying, I would have never thought about that.

These do pack like 5-7 carbs so I don't see myself eating them often.  Even if you get a HUGE serving of fat from the oil and cream cheese.

But it is a nice treat to cook up if you are having guests or just are in the mood for desert.

From wikipedia:

""There are two ways an autostereogram can be viewed: wall-eyed and cross-eyed.[1] Most autostereograms (including those in this article) are designed to be viewed in only one way, which is usually wall-eyed. Wall-eyed viewing requires that the two eyes adopt a relatively parallel angle, while cross-eyed viewing requires a relatively convergent angle. An image designed for wall-eyed viewing if viewed correctly will appear to pop out of the background, while if viewed cross-eyed it will instead appear as a cut-out behind the background and will be difficult to bring entirely into focus.""
