I wasn‚Äôt even old enough to remember but I‚Äôve watched the games/ seen the highlights. For like a solid 5 year period Jermaine was the best returner in the league. 

In 2000, when we had one of the GOAT defenses with a pathetic offense, he was often the difference with his returns giving our offense field position to score or taking it in himself.

Jacoby was special in 2012, but Jermaine was great in 2000 and years before that.

They tend to be conservative in the US because they were the contras who received support from Regan‚Ä¶but there are people who fled for a variety of reasons even if they were poor, benefitted, and preferred the Socialists, but maybe were forced into service/family died in the bombings/fleeing the ravages of being poor and scared in a war/etc. 
Those people see Regan in a different light and view the Republicans with far more trepidation. 

 Those main groups of Nicaraguans are a tiny minority of immigrants who immigrated here after US‚Äôs proxy conflicts with Russia in the 80‚Äôs, themselves a small group of Latino immigrants, Latinos themselves, a group among many different types of immigrants. Shit‚Äôs wild, I don‚Äôt really understand why we talk about immigrants in such broad strokes.

I do agree with you that broadly tho, Republicans have no idea what socialism actually is.",1625097601

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That's the definition of propaganda.  And if you're communicating that you like a taco and express that other people might like it too, you're spreading the idea that ""this taco is good"", which is, by definition, propaganda.  What the goal of the spread of the idea is, is up to the individual expressing it.  I agree that there are connotations associated with the words ""propaganda"" and ""solidarity"" that strongly correlate them with things like social movements and revolution and stuff, and that it's weird to use them when talking about chalupas.  

Separate the connotation, though.  Then when we break things down we can see that ""X brand is tasty and I like it (you should try it, too. I hope you like it, then we have something in common!)"" is propaganda. It is in that it's spreading an idea through an appeal to emotion (""I like X, it is _good_, it makes me happy"") and that the hopeful outcome in expressing that idea is that others will agree (""If we both like it, then there's more of us, and we have things to talk about, feel comfortable about, etc""), and so it's an appeal for solidarity. That's why I used those words.

I know I'm breaking it down a lot, but I'm trying to point out how it is what it is. You're right that it's a recommendation and small talk.  What's the goal in sharing that recommendation? Whether or not it's intended, a goal that's been fulfilled by whoever benefits from that recommendation is that they've received free advertising and mind space.  That ends up encouraging others to consume whatever thing was recommended.  A single, personal recommendation may not feel like a big deal, but a rain drop never feels responsible for a flood, and all that.

Whether or not that causes societal, environment, or personal harm is the discussion that is led to by looking at it this way.",1625097602

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***

 

TLDR  - I said something that my brother's then-girlfriend-now-fiancee found offensive. She pitched a fit and left in a huff. I told my brother she's no longer welcome in my home and it's causing lots of family drama.

Full  story - In January of last year I (37M) invited family to my home for dinner (my brother 33M, his girlfriend Missy 34F, my mom 68F and her SO 66M). During the dinner conversation, I asked my brother about the well-being of a mutual acquaintance that I haven't seen in ages, whose name slipped my mind at the time. So while I'm groping for the name, I said something along the lines of ""the mulatto  woman who used to work in the accounting department at your job"".

NOTE - Before the PC activists jump all over me, the woman ***proudly and emphatically*** self-identifies as mulatto. I did not say anything disrespectful and used this woman's preferred terminology.

Missy apparently didn't know the background or the woman's preferences, and tore into me for being a racist. I tried to defuse the situation and explained to her that I was using the woman's preferred terminology. She continued raving at me and calling me a racist, so I snapped at her that she's inferring offense where none is implied and to stop acting  like a drama queen. She threw a tantrum and stormed out of my house, leaving my brother to ask for a ride home from me or my mom. After she  left I told my brother that he is always welcome in my home, but his bitch of a girlfriend isn't.

I  heard from a mutual friend that for the past year and a half, Missy continues to tell all of her friends and family that I'm a racist jerk.

Flash forward to this year. My bro proposed to Missy on Christmas Day, so now they're engaged. Now that a large percentage of the population is vaccinated, my mom wants to throw them an engagement party. Both my mom and my brother live in fairly small condo units while I own a house with a bit more space and a yard, so mom asked if she could hold the party at my house.

I told my mom not just no, but hell no. I'll be civil if and when I encounter Missy at family occasions, but that woman is not welcome in my home after insulting me and continuing to slander me for over a year.

Mom asked if I'd be amenable if Missy apologized. I told her maybe, but probably not, since Missy continues to slander me, so I'd have a hard time believing her sincerity.

At this point, Mom is in tears, my brother is pissed at me and my mom's SO  is trying to play peacemaker and convince me and Missy to start fresh and play nice.

Everyone's telling me that I should just let it go and get over it, but I'm digging in my heels and ready to die on this hill.

So, AITA here?

-Mess with your sensitivity and make sure you find one perfect for yourself. I recommend going into settings and turn the ‚ÄúADS modifier‚Äù to 1 or 2 scale below your regular sensitivity.

-Placement wins more engagements then aim can. Always have a way out, never put yourself in the open if you don‚Äôt need to

-I know people always say ‚Äúplay what you want to play with‚Äù but I‚Äôm gonna recommend using the meta (120 or 140 hand cannon) as it will train your aim in the process

I‚Äôm almost exclusive to playing Crucible, Rumble in my opinion is the best area to hone your skills. It teaches you how to place yourself against multiple enemies and constantly puts you in gunfights. Hope you become great and welcome to the Titan gang!",1625097604

"theevilwithin","t5_2wzi8","I'm actually surprised people aren't picking Ruvik, I thought he was more favored than Keeper and Laura. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of either or Ruvik, so I would never buy them. It's like when they introduced Resident Evil DBD, I thought it'd be Albert Wesker instead of Nemesis as the killer. 

Stefano can teleport.

Stefano has a knife, and is even able to fling it dead on without even pausing to aim like he threw one at Sebastian for the Guardian and in the boss fight. 

He can summon Obscura for a couple seconds, as Obscura is his pride and joy compared to the Guardian. Maybe she can hunt down a survivor, and her flash stuns the survivor and lets Stefano know their location. 

Stefano looks to have background in explosives, as he was able to create small bombs that blew up just enough to blow up heads for his art. Place some explosives on the ground and wound a survivor. The floating ones from the boss fight would be too obvious, unless he can disguise them using camouflage. 

His finishing move (forgot what it was called, been awhile since I played DBD) is freezing them with his camera, before slashing them in the neck. Maybe saying ""Such composition!"" or ""Now you are my art."" 

Stefano's alternate outfit is the one from his poster. Black suit pants, black gloves, black shoes that shine, black belt with silver buckle, white dress shirt with a button unbuttoned at the top, black vest, and those long formal (trench?)coats. 

That's what I could come up with. Stefano has been my ultimate favorite villain, so obviously I would think of him first and not the others lol. Also either I don't play enough video games, but the only other artistic bad guy I know of is Sander Cohen from Bioshock. We don't seem to have enough villains like that.",1625097604

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Two things. 

1. The realization that we all (I‚Äôm aware that isn‚Äôt strictly true but I‚Äôm comfortable generalizing when it applies to over 9/10 people) just belong to our parents‚Äô or nation‚Äôs religion. If I had never been introduced to the concept then reading the Bible as a grown man it would register similarly to any work of fiction like Lord of the Rings. 

2. Reading the actual Bible in its entirety. There are clear trends particularly throughout the Old Testament showing a progression of fundamentally distinct religious traditions which were developed to serve the people believing them at the time. I fully believe the New Testament discusses a telephoned life of a real person who was a respected teacher and prophet but I don‚Äôt see the progression and harmony that many people seem to. The God described in Genesis is different than the one described in the later OT and different than the one described in the NT. The dynamics at play correlate well with the historical facts of the cyclically shitty and nice circumstances the people writing the OT were living through over the centuries. Moreover, harmonizing the concept of Jesus of Nazareth and the concept of a messianic figure requires monumental interpolation, extrapolation and in my view outright revision of what is presented in previous scripture. Furthermore, the imminent apocalypse preacher is the clearest image of Jesus I can accept and whereas Paul does do some valid theology heavy lifting to delay his predictions a few generations maybe the idea of literally thousands of years going by is one that I have never heard satisfactory explanation for. There are explanations that are better than others but that doesn‚Äôt make any of them good.",1625097604

My errand was in the Junior department (buying a birthday gift for a friend's older daughter).   So I wheeled him over.  The young sales associate was behind the counter, on the phone, so I addressed my son (in his stroller--she couldn't see him).  ""That behavior is NOT okay,"" I said firmly.

I am selling my excellent condition Monta Skyquest, purchased June 2021. 

  
The SkyQuest is an amazing GMT watch, with excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail.   
It has excellent proportions, with a 40mm(+/-) case that wears very flat at only 12mm thick. Very easy to put on a different strap with a 20mm lug width, and the articulating bracelet on these watches are extremely comfortable, and very well finished from Monta, with half-links, quick adjust, and easy re-sizing.  
Full set included: box and papers/warranty card. Great condition, light wear (only worn several times).

Time stamp:¬†https://imgur.com/a/y8dcjct  
Asking: $1,600 (SOLD) OBO Paypal, F&amp;F only; or Venmo. Sell only, sorry no trades as I need the cash.  


Shipping: CONUS / Priority USPS with tracking and Insurance.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The only real difference is that China does worse shit to people living inside its own borders while America is worse to those living outside them. That and their PR and values which they use for their diplomacy.

The only other major difference I can think of is China being more expansionist than the USA, and the only reason for that is because USA has expanded to the point where they no longer have enough strategic value in expansion to merit more of it. Seriously, China wants Taiwan because it is literally right off China's largest and most important coast and can easily be used to strengthen a blockade and/or prevent China sea access. Having control of Taiwan is also literally the only way China can possibly have a blue-water navy. For China, control over Taiwan is literally a national security issue.

Meanwhile, USA has control over lands that are far from their mainland whose use is less defensive and more offensive. You simply cannot say this about China.

Now, before people jump on me for ""defending China's claim on Taiwan,"" that's not what I'm doing. The point here is that China is acting belligerent because there is a massive strategic incentive to do so. USA doesn't do that because they have no strategic incentive to do so. Why does it have no strategic incentive? Because they already took the chance to consolidate their geopolitical position before now. If anything, the US's claims to Hawaii and Guam were even less valid when they were made than China's claim to Taiwan is now.

The ultimate point being that it's disingenuous to look at these things purely as they are without considering the context and history that led these two world powers to very different positions today, and it just so happens that America has far less of an incentive to act up than China does, because they already did their acting up before now. Again, none of this is to say China should be acting the way it is, but comparing the actions of world powers the way (I assume) you're doing is distinctly unbalanced in favor of the US.",1625097605

If they end up 100 and in on longer holes, I just drop in the fairway after they hit, or just chip from the fringe if they hit the green.

"keto","t5_2rske","Sucks that no one in your life is there to celebrate or encourage this journey.  But it‚Äôs a fun ride. Hopefully feeling better and knowing you‚Äôre becoming healthier are enough reward to keep on this path. But moral support would be nice. 

When I first started keto years ago, not only did people in my life not encourage me, they actively discouraged me from doing it. This was before it became a fad. Now these people don‚Äôt argue against keto any longer because society has accepted it in recent years. But it sure wasn‚Äôt fun trying to convince them I was not killing myself with this new eating approach. They saw the weight fall off, but it was still too new back then and sounded too novel for them to accept. 

I‚Äôll encourage you to keep on this journey. Health benefits are numerous, much more so depending on where you came from dietarily. Encourage you too also do some resistance training if you‚Äôre not already doing that. The health benefit of exercise on top of better eating is vast. You clearly have discipline so hopefully you can incorporate some resistance training if not already on that path and be that much better off for it.

Joking aside, 5MHz relatively forgiving as far as ‚ÄúRF‚Äù goes - your wavelength is ~60m, so you don‚Äôt need to worry much about impedance transformation over the length of a short wire or trace. And parasitical like the capacitance of a thru-hole component lead or ground plane won‚Äôt hurt too badly like it will and 100MHz and up.

That said, if you‚Äôre doing ADC and need to maintain some signal fidelity, probably best to read up on some RF basics about impedance matching between components, slew rate and the limiting factors on it on a circuit board, and proper impedance termination. Other than that, I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it.

His punish game looks crazy even for a heavy, with a better version of Ryu/Ken down B and a lot of moves that will condition people to not shield. I think those two aspects are interesting because when you get in, you can use faster burst moves like dash attack to make the opponent shield more, then go for grabs and maybe even a shield break to make them afraid to shield, and then the opponent would be more hesitant and vulnerable to moves like the wind god fist which can easily lead to a kill.",1625097608

A med to fix your PTSD like ""Okay, take this SSRI for the rest of your life"" isn't a good answer either.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","They were considering this, however the appraiser wrote a very detailed explanation after the contested first appraisal. 

House is older 1923, half of finished space is in the basement, small bedrooms, missing modern hvac components. They expanded comp radius quite a bit and found almost exact comps in the 198k price range even closer to the city. 

MIL feels like the appraisal is right now, I think the question is - wait until deadline to give sellers times to think a little more? Does this hurt her negatively to pull out of contract?

Scammers have been creating accounts that closely resemble the username of sellers and then DMing interested parties pretending to be the seller. **Always be wary of people who DM you directly** and double check who you're dealing with. Don't forget you can always comment on the original post to make sure you're dealing with OP. 

**Don't get scammed!**

* If someone doesn't or won't comment on your post **DO NOT WORK WITH THEM** and [report them to moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComblocMarket) This fights scammers by requiring them to comment on your post before contacting you. Scammers that we have already banned can't comment. It's one of the easiest ways to check for a scam. We also don't let newly created fake accounts comment or participate on the sub.

**Don't buy items if the photo doesn't have a username included in it.**

* This is an added level of security required to ensure that you or the seller has that item in their possession. Report posts that don't have this in them as it breaks sub rules and will lead to a permanent ban from the sub.

In any other situation its typical for the employer to pay to have a background check done on the candidate as they are the 3rd party between Billups and the accuser.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical health risks  
Cocaine is risky for anyone with high blood pressure or a heart condition, but even healthy young people can have a fit, heart attack or stroke after using the drug.  
The risk of overdose increases if you mix cocaine with other drugs or alcohol.  
Over time, snorting cocaine damages the cartilage in your nose that separates your nostrils. Heavy users can lose this cartilage and end up with one large nostril and a misshapen nose.  
Taking cocaine when pregnant can damage your baby, cause miscarriage, premature labour and low birth weight.  
Regularly smoking crack can cause breathing problems and pains in the chest.  
Injecting cocaine can damage veins and cause ulcers and gangrene. Sharing needles or other injecting equipment can spread HIV and hepatitis infections too. It's also easier to overdose from injecting cocaine.  
Speedballing (injecting a mixture of cocaine and heroin) can have fatal results. A form of heroin called white heroin, is easily mistaken for cocaine and people have died or been hospitalised after snorting it thinking it was cocaine.  
Mental health risks  
Regular use of cocaine can make people feel:  
depressed  
run-down  
anxious  
paranoid  
Cocaine can bring previous mental health problems to the surface too, and if a relative has had mental health problems, there might be an increased risk for you.  
Social risks  
Frequent users find they begin to crave more of the drug ‚Äì so it can become an expensive habit to keep up with.  
Environmental risks  
Cocaine doesn't just damage the people who take it. It wrecks the communities that it's grown in and leads to deforestation. Find out more about how cocaine wrecks communities.  
What is cocaine cut with?  
The purity of cocaine goes up and down depending on the market.  
A wrap of cocaine powder can be cut with many things, such as sugar or starch, but benzocaine is the most common.  
Benzocaine is a local anaesthetic that produces a numbing effect similar to cocaine, but without the cocaine high.",1625097610

UPS+Amazon+USPS=280 AC.  Fed Ex = 415 AC. 

Now I love UPS.  Worked there for 3 years out of high school.  Their ground model is fantastic.  Probably the best in the world. However, their expedited shipping, while good, is mot the same as Fed Ex. 

Fed Ex does what no one, and I mean no one, in the entire world can do.  They are definitely not perfect. Its unfortunate that OP PS5 is missing and thats not acceptable. Still, Fed Ex is hands down the best priority shipper in the world.",1625097612

"RetroNickelodeon","t5_16imk2","I'm always open to suggestions, so none of this is finalized and feedback is very much appreciated.  The general approach I'm taking with it is keeping the same pulp adventure vibe, but adding more interesting decisions to make all along the way.  I'm assuming that this won't be picked up by the official license, so I'm calling it Renard's Ruins.  Ruins are pretty close to mystical temples, and Renard... well, I'm being a bit self-indulgent with that one, but it works into the theme I'm going for.  With the number of changes I'm thinking of, the vibe would be there, but it would probably be too different to bear the name of the series properly.  But I do want to include the essence of what made it great in the first place, with my own spin on top.

So I started with the big centerpiece: the temple run, or the Ruins Raid for reasons I'll get to later.  The fantasy behind that event is very solid, so I'm sticking with that but expanding on it.  It's still going to be a room by room mini-task solving experience to progress from room to room to get to a treasure and get back out within a time limit.  Guards will still be present but possibly with different 'modes' they can be set to aside from just the classic one.  With the progress in recording technology, the side cut-away view of the ruins is no longer required and opens up a lot of possibilities.  I'm thinking a 6x6 floorplan for the first floor with a 2x6 second floor over top of the 3rd and 4th rows.  That's 48 different rooms, which is a lot, but it will add a lot of variety to possible paths through the ruins.  

The biggest change I'm making is that changing it from being stand alone episodes to being a season long competition with running tallies from episode to episode, taking some inspiration from Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman.  This is so that getting eliminated early and having to watch the entirety of the episode from the sidelines isn't a thing, because that just feels bad.  It's also to give teams a bit more of an identity than just the logo.  There will still be an episode winner each time though, but instead of eliminating the last 2 teams in each round, it will be determined by points (themed as treasure, or gold, or what have you) earned in that specific episode awarded by placement at the end of each of the challenges leading up to the Raid.  Coming in first in a challenge also earns you small piece of information to help you in the Raid.  Even if you're mathematically eliminated from winning that episode, points earned will count towards the season total for the final winner, so no giving up!  The number of rounds before the final Ruin Raid has expanded to four, and the point leader will go to the Raid round, but will be given a choice as to how the round is conducted: they will have to either challenge another team to run against them in the Ruin Raid, or to challenge Renard himself (the 'villain' of the framing story around the show) for a greater reward at the cost of a higher risk of failure, as Renard always has unexpected tricks up his sleeve to contend with.  Challenging another team will earn the winner a small percentage of the loser's total season points earned thus far (10%?).  This brings some interesting choices as do you challenge a weaker team for a theoretical higher chance of winning while risking putting them back in the race if they pull the upset, or a stronger team for a bigger reward if you win?  Or do you go full greed mode and challenge Renard?  (Non-participating teams could possibly bet on the outcome too?  TBD)

In addition to winning the challenge between the final two teams, merely completing the run under the time limit is important in and of itself.  The treasures you are raiding the ruins to get are fueling Renard's plans, and a certain amount of them (75%? TBD) need to successfully retrieved from runs by the end of the season, or else RENARD wins instead of any of the teams.  This will affect choices made in the next big addition: special abilities.  Each team is still animal themed, and they will each be given three special abilities based around said theme to be used during the Ruin Raid or saved for later- even if your team isn't participating.  These abilities are unique to your team, and are fueled by collecting mana crystals during the lead up challenges hidden in out of the way spots.  Mana can also be spent giving a time bonus (or perhaps a head start?) to your team during a challenge.  Unspent mana can carry over into future episodes, up to a cap.  (1/3 to 1/2? of max?)  UnCOLLECTED mana crystals are given to Renard who has his own abilities to essentially troll the other teams.  So then the question is do take the time to grab crystals, or focus on the task at hand?  Do you burn mana to win the early rounds and then be tapped when for the Raid?  Or do you save it and risk not making it that far?  And during the Raid do you try and screw over your competition, or do you prioritize getting the treasures to avoid the global loss?

The last thing I would like to do is adding a framing story to tie episodes together and create more immersion. The TL;DR is that in the realm of Sylvan, the clans gather together every few years to choose a new leader through a competition.  Renard had tricked his way into control of the Wolf clan (who will serve as the Ruin Guards), hijacked that competition, and usurped and claimed the crown and it's magic for himself.  The other clans have banded together to kick him out by retrieving the stolen treasures that fuel the magic he uses to stay in power.   Each clan has a Clan leader that represents the teams and provide them the special abilities that they use.  There will also be story bumpers at the start and end of each episode that will tie into how the season is going.  Hopefully this will further inject character into the teams and even a small story, if done well, can be engaging enough to create emotional investment.

So that's pretty long-winded, but I've been percolating these ideas for a while now.  I'm working on a design document with further details, but it's still very incomplete right now.  But feedback on whether this concept is worth pursuing and actually pitching to TV executives, and opinions on what's good and what would need changing would be appreciated.  I honestly have no clue what I'm doing, but I hope I've picked up enough design sense over the years to make something entertaining!",1625097613

"Breath_of_the_Wild","t5_3f1s6","Depends on what exactly you mean by 100% as there are multiple **very** different definitions for it:

* [The only in-game counter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/dr5fc7/guide_what_does_and_does_not_count_for_100/) solely tracks MAP completion and nothing else, and since the 900 Korok Seed icons on your map are also factored in and everything has the same value regardless of importance, this makes for a super awkward counter. If you do literally everything there is to do but do not pick up Korok Seeds, then the highest ""completion"" count you can achieve is a bit less than 25% total. And since stuff like quests, bosses and the Hyrule Compendium do NOT count for this particular counter, you can also achieve 100% by completing less than a quarter of the actual game.
* Then there is the 100% ruleset for official speedruns: Click on ""View Rules"" [here](https://www.speedrun.com/botw#100)  ...however, these rules do NOT feature certain aspects of the game, like most of the armor sets for example. Only a handful of specific sets count here.
* If you just want to do everything there is to do in the game regardless of any official / in-game rules, then [someone made a neat checklist just for that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/g21beq/botw_100_checklist/), but keep in mind that some parts are not really possible to achieve. For example, you can not hold **all** unique armor items at once, since the armor inventory caps at 100 slots but if you include the base game, DLC and all amiibo armor items, then you would need 107 spaces to keep them all.",1625097615

Mjolnir armor not only makes the wearer strong enough to flip tanks and shake off orbital drops, but also enhances their reflexes by a ton (Chief is significantly faster in the novels). And this is all with Gen 1-2 Mjolnir. Gen 3 is obviously even better.


Add this to every power up and Freelancer equipment, and Chief is one of the most lethal people in the galaxy. He's better trained than Tex/Carolina and stronger than the Meta with all of their abilities and the ability to operate them all effortlessly.

However... while there are more CCS plus than Supercharger plugs, *most* CCS plugs are still limited to just 50 kW.  The entire west coast charging corridor along I-5 (prior to EA) are all 50 kW stations and CalTrans is still installing new 50kW units at rest stops.

If you compare ""high speed"" stations (&gt;=150 kW) there are many more Supercharger plugs than CCS plugs.  That excludes all of Tesla's ""Urban"" (~75 kW) and ""v1"" (~120 kW) Superchargers.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Okay, page 10 and 11 literally prove my point. Here's the exact quote:

By removing the threat of a criminal prosecution, D.A. Castor reasoned, Cosby would no longer be able in a civil lawsuit to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for fear that his statements could later be used against him by the Commonwealth. Mr. Castor would later testify that this was his intent:

""The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person may not be compelled to give evidence against themselves. So you can‚Äôt subpoena somebody and make them testify that they did something illegalÔÇæor evidence that would lead someone to conclude they did something illegalÔÇæon the threat of if you don‚Äôt answer, you‚Äôll be subject to sanctions because you‚Äôre under subpoena.

**So the way you remove that from a witness isÔÇæif you want to, and what I did in this caseÔÇæis I made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. Cosby would not be prosecuted no matter what. As a matter of law, that then made it so that he could not take the Fifth Amendment ever as a matter of law.**

So I have heard banter in the courtroom and in the press the term ‚Äúagreement,‚Äù but everybody has used the wrong word. I told \[Cosby‚Äôs attorney at the time, Walter\] Phillips that I had decided that, because of defects in the case, that the case could not be won and that I was going to make a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. Cosby.

**I told him that I was making it as the sovereign Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. Cosby would not be allowed to take the Fifth Amendment in the subsequent civil suit that Andrea Constand‚Äôs lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.**

\[Attorney\] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of Pennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if Cosby was subpoenaed, he would be required to testify.

But those two things were not connected one to the other. Mr. Cosby was not getting prosecuted at all ever as far as I was concerned. **And my belief was that, as the Commonwealth and the representative of the sovereign, that I had the power to make such a statement and that, by doing so, as a matter of law Mr. Cosby would be unable to assert the Fifth Amendment in a civil deposition.**

\[Attorney\] Phillips, a lawyer of vastly more experience even than meÔÇæand I had 20 years on the job by that pointÔÇæagreed with my legal assessment.

And he said that he would communicate that to the lawyers who were representing Mr. Cosby in the pending civil suit""

Recalling his thought process at the time, the former district attorney further emphasized that it was ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù his intent to remove ‚Äúfor all time‚Äù the possibility of prosecution, because ‚Äúthe ability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.‚Äù

"biomutant","t5_3ns97","I recommend going luck until you reach 100% crit (or 100% loot chance if you want to always get a health pack and random gear for practically every chest you open)

That crit chance can go a long way in the early to mid game. Around level 18 you'd be seeing definite crits in any gear. So fashion has now become viable.

All that lackluster loot can be scrapped for materials, this is especially useful if you want to deep dive into crafting and upgrading your own Ultimate-grade weapons (that can be stronger than the static Ultimate weapons you can find).

For shotties, I'm sorry but they aren't as great as they could be (yet, hopefully they get patched). &gt;!Best shottie to have is if you get lucky and find a shotgun with Autotrigger and decent stats to boot (or Precise, Chainshot, Blast Module for meme-ing).!&lt;

My advice, hold out until you find some static Ultimates &gt;!like the Pri Murgel Sword, Knok Umph, and or Sparkatron Hypicskromp !&lt;. After Crit chance and loot chance are at desired levels, start pumping that Str or Int, depends wether you want damage from melee or psi-abilities. 

Don't worry about falling behind. &gt;!you can find melee weapons with Overpowered which give percentage increases to damage per Str level which means you can start outdamage-ing anything!&lt; Reach level 30 and find all three training spots for Str, Agility and Viltality. Then sort through the base weapon types you want to use, scrap EVERYTHING you don't want to use, and craft your very own personalized Ultimate in style.

I'm at level 53, just finished one playthrough now going into NG+, made about 4 different Ultimates / Relics of my own all the while not looking like a hobo (or a super-hobo if you want), and I can still make more.",1625097619

"Palestine","t5_2qhak","Well, we will obviously disagree on this issue. But sticking just to the facts:

1. To your first paragraph: No I didn‚Äôt miss the point at all. Zionism and Israeli politics can‚Äôt be segregated at all. They are completely intertwined. There‚Äôs no Israel without Zionism so how can the two be separated. Israel was formed on occupied land and is a result of annexation of Palestine, Saudi Arabia is not. So we can‚Äôt compare the two. (it‚Äôs a separate issue that I detest Saudi Arabian politicians and they are even worse than Israelis) 
 
2. To your second paragraph: completely agree

3. To your third paragraph: Modern day Israel/Palestine was originally owned but not occupied (the Turks never fully migrated to Palestine) by The Ottomans who lost the war against the Britain and consequently lost part not all of the territory. The land claimed by Britain was promised to create a Jewish state but that was only a fraction of the land that Israel currently claims. The remaining land was rightfully owned by Palestinians (passed on by Turkish landlords to local Palestinians; also international borders were marked by UN). Israel continues to illegally occupy the lands and settle while evicting Palestinians. Palestinians are denied building rights and forced to demolish the homes that they built themselves. If not, they have to pay high fees for the Israeli military to destroy them. Then Israel hires the same Palestinians to build homes for the illegal Jewish settlers on the same exact land. 

Also to your third paragraph: Israeli Arabs don‚Äôt have have same rights as Israeli Jews. There is segregation and systematic oppression although not as blatant and inhumane as it is against the Palestinians.

To your third paragraph: Yes Palestinians signed up not to be citizens of Israel under Oslo accord but also under Oslo accord, Israel as the official occupier signed up for some responsibilities towards Palestinians which it wholeheartedly denies. Most recent example includes deliberately NOT vaccinating Palestinians against COVID despite being one of the earliest countries to achieve mass vaccination successfully. It‚Äôs the only country in the world to vaccinate people based on their religion. 

To your third paragraph: Israel is not supposed to control Al-Aqsa mosque under international accords but it illegally does. Worshippers are harassed and the provoked by Israeli police and military routinely at the mosque. Even more shamefully, they disrespect Islam and the holy place of worship. I can tell you for a fact that this is against the teaching of Torah. This exact issue triggered the recent conflict this year. 

To your fourth paragraph: I pointed out history and facts of how Israel was created so hopefully it gives some insights into your point of Palestine attacked Israel - that is not true. 

To your last paragraph: Israel aims at civilians- the numbers are there to see. 
And by the way, the terrorists that you mention ie, Hamas, are a creation of Israel. A little research will tell you how Israel supported the creation of Hamas to break up PLO as a result of their divide and rule policy. It another thing it fired back for them.",1625097619

My hair falls out in clumps when I brush my fingers thru it. It comes from all over my head tho, not just in one spot. I cut my hair recently from waist to just above my boobs. Theres a lot less falling out now. I think long hair just gets pushed around more. I don't get the big knots as often. Like you, I would kind of rip and break those apart with my fingers. 

When I get anxious I run my fingers thru like one piece of hair at a time until I feel one good to pull (Ugh that sounds so gross). It will be either an extra thick piece, super thin piece, or crinkly random piece. My hair is both stick straight and slightly wavy. Sometimes ill find an extra wavy one. It's gotta go. I can do this for an hour. If I put my hair in a pony tail or bun I can resist. I'll find my hand going to my hair, but then I stop. 

Right now the brand I got on Amazon is ""Nature's Bounty"". It says to take 3 daily, but I started with two, then one. It's really really hard on my stomach. Plus it makes my sweat smell. Maybe that just happens with me tho cause I don't drink much water. I don't think the brand matters much. 

Oh, conditioner is important. I never use to take the extra step. The Wet Brush works to not yank out my hair. I wait till my hair is damp and there's no extra ripping.",1625097620

In my cousin's family, two of the boys went to Germany, one went to Kiribati.

The German ones had a lower number of baptisms, the Kiribati one lacked creature comforts like a solid house, a bed, most foods, a flushing toilet, etc. There's a photo of him and his companions excitedly holding up eggs like they are made of gold, because they hadn't had eggs in 3 months.

One of the Germans was like ""man one time we waited all week for just ONE teaching appointment, and then it was cancelled. That was tough"".

"TopMindsOfReddit","t5_35g9w","Oh god is this a Q and A on the intricacies of the first amendment? Okay one at a time. 

&gt;So if the government funds an event, it is then wrong and illegal for a politician to ask/demand that individuals working with/in it to be ""fired"" if they express vile, hateful or just idiotic views?

Yes. If the company holding the event independantly choose to censure or fire that person indendantly thats fine. 

&gt;Just as a aside, is it also wrong for politicians to demand that other politicians should step down?

No because they arent the voters they are alps part of the government. If its the opposition party they have no power over them if its their own party then its no different than a workplace squabble. 

 &gt;They are, after all, individuals who are funded by the government. Where goes the line?

But they are not in the ultimate position of power over that person. They also aren't funded by the government they are funded by the people. 

&gt;Politicians criticising athletes/celebrities for their opinions and demanding that they should not be allowed to represent the country is.. the most literal example?

I didnt say celebrities as they arent funded by government but even so, Yes. 

Its fascism pure and simple. The government can't fire someone for saying something they don't like. That's the whole point. 

&gt;But, that ""specific demographic of voters"" are his voters. That is how democracy works, you get to vote for the candidate/party you want to represent you.

No no no no no. You vote for people to best represent your interests not to break constitution because it hurts your fee fees. Otherwise there is nothing to stop any republican from arresting or having fired anyone that disagrees with them and claiming its 'what my voters want' because those people you are arresting or having fired are also your voters even EVEN IF they didn't vote for you personally. 

&gt;&gt;As for athletes representing her country. Is she not doing that by calling for her country to be better? Or is this a racist thing?

&gt;Yeah, I don't disagree with that. She has as much right as anyone.

....? Then how is it okay for someone in a position of power who is supposed to be, as part of their job, upholding that right calling for them to be fired for it? 

&gt;The politician obviously know his voters.

Please tell me this is satire. 

A Texas congressman knows 29 million people personally? And all those 29 million people all disagree with what she did so fervently the congressman can then fuck off the constitution? 

Are you high? 

&gt;Furthermore, for someone angry about how that politician ""breaks the first amendment"" you sure aren't happy about him and his supporters saying what they say.

Okay again I can say what I like because I have freedom of speech. I can dislike what another political party says. I can hate them I can call for their firing even. You know why? I'm not in government? I'm not in a position where its literally my job to uphold the first amendment. 

&gt;And the athlete doesn't need to ""pander"" to whomever. It's not like the politician and his supporters will start to like her.

You are the one saying she does because if she doesnt she forfeits her first amendment rights. 

&gt;Can you actually cite a courtcase or something that shows that what he did was illegal?

The first amendment. 

&gt;Also, do you believe I don't agree that they are racists?

Im just showing as emphatically as I can that you are arguing that the opinions of racists and 'patriots' should overcome her personal rights under the US constitution 

&gt;I haven't said he has the right to demand that she should be arrested, so it is a bit disingenious to infer that. Now, you obviously do not agree that politicians have the right to criticise or ask/demand that someone is ""fired"", but you haven't actually cited anything that support your views.

I give up you obviously can't read my first sentence. 

&gt;And, again, politicians are supposed to represent the people and specifically their voters so it stands to reason that they should ""speak up"" if their voters demand it

Again. Their white racist voters. You realise they have black people in texas?

Edit: I never said what he did was illegal either. Its unconstitional maybe which never stopped a rep before but no one who isn't playing partisan bullshit should be defending this.",1625097621

"Ergatta","t5_2u7qb6","I just got my Ergatta a couple of weeks. The tablet does have an HDMI port on it. I was able to connect it to my TV. I'm not sure about putting a bigger tablet on the machine. I don't think the Ergatta app is in the app store. There are some other connections on the back of the screen that are required for the sensors. They may be USB, though. I'd have to check when I got off work. I feel like one of the sensors uses a barrel connector. I'll take a picture shortly when I get home.

Here‚Äôs the back. Looks like just USB to me.

The app doesn‚Äôt appear to be in the App Store or it‚Äôs hidden.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA - your grandma violated your privacy by snooping through your stuff, that alone is enough to make anyone's depression and anxiety skyrocket.

However, your grandma took in *four* children after her daughter died? Children are hard, and the older ones are the ones you hope you *don't* have to worry about in situations like this.

&gt;I told her that I hadn't made any new friends due to how anxious I get around people and she didn't seem to understand that

You did the right thing bringing your declining mental health to her attention, but you said it yourself; she doesn't seem to understand it. Anxiety is *extremely"" hard for people to understand who haven't actually been through it themselves. It takes a lot of time, patience, and education to be able to empathize with people who suffer. Chances are, she probably thinks you're just going through normal teenager stuff, hence why she's trying to force feed you into a social life. (Even my fiance has taken a few years to fully grasp the concept of the shit that goes on in my head. He legitimately didn't realize it was even possible for people to feel like this)

&gt;I always thought my internal organs were going to burst out everytime she did that to me.

Have you explained *any* of this, in detail, to her? I guarantee, if she has a shred of decency, you sit down and talk to her and explain that you don't feel comfortable talking to people and you *don't know why you feel this way and think you might need some help* she would probably take it a little more seriously. At your age, it might be your only option until you are old enough to get the help you need on your own.

I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. I can't imagine what you must be going through and the emotions you're feeling. It's okay to ask for help. Try not to shut everyone and everything out, that only makes the world feel so much more lonely. I understand how the online friends can feel like your only lifeline, you just need to help your grandma understand too. Sex trafficking is a very scary and a very prevalent reality in online communities, she has a right to be upset, but she also needs to put forth the effort to meet you in the middle. It really does seem like she cares about you, she just isn't quite going about it the right way. Remember, she lost someone she gave birth to and this is all new territory for her.

"Velo","t5_2s4ji","Bike races mostly aren‚Äôt chip timed because it doesn‚Äôt matter.  First over the line wins.  A lot of the stupid junk that big running and triathlon races give you like medals and t shirts and whatnot aren‚Äôt that much a part of bike races.  Bike races are (mostly) cheaper.  They happen every weekend.  Sometimes during the week.  Sometimes in parking lots. 

Getting into racing is easy.  Just go on bikereg.com and find a local race, enter it, and see how it goes.

HOWEVER, before you enter a race, you need to get some experience riding in a group.  Go to your closest local bike shop and ask about local riding groups, or go online and find a local group ride.  The absolute worst thing that can happen in a bike race is you cause a crash because you can‚Äôt ride straight or handle your bike with people really close to you.  Bike racing is all about drafting, so you need to get comfortable riding really close to people and riding efficiently.

Other than that, go nuts.  A lot of people I meet seem to think bike racing is some magical thing, and so they‚Äôre scared or intimidated.  But it‚Äôs not like that.  This is not triathlon.  Barrier to entry is just having a bike and $20.  Just go pay your money and get dropped, make some friends, join a team, spam the email list, gain some fitness, and have a good time.",1625097623

"warriors","t5_2rtiv","&gt;He‚Äôs a triple minus on defence.

I'll deal with it. We're stuck in cap hell, of course whoever we get will be bad at one aspect. Our bench should be defensively good due to the team defense and coaching schemes. I've always said that whoever we get as the Vet PG, their defense isn't a factor.

Offense &gt; Defense, especially in lower minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On cheap vet money for sure as a shooter who will play 8 and maybe 20 while hot.

He'll play 10-14 minutes as our 2nd string PG to help run the bench and shoot.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Otherwise the triple minus on D is not really worth it. You could get a better outcome developing Poole IMO.

I feel like the team and the org, specifically Kerr already have a vision for what Poole could be, and he knows and has discussed it already. It's unlikely he shifts, I'd bet he just evolves his playmaking AS a SG.",1625097623

I also prefer the experience points design. Something about gaining even small amounts of progress while doing random muck-about Far Cry stuff goes a long way in keeping the gameplay loop engaging. Dying Light's ""Legend Level"" system is a great example of this.

I like that they tried something new with FC5's perk point system--I really enjoyed solving the Prepper Stashes. But fingers crossed we get the EXP bar back for FC6 and there's other rewards waiting for us in the Yara version of the Prepper Stashes.

EDIT: My money says that Ubi will go back to the EXP system, but still include the FC5 challenges. Only, the challenges will reward large amounts of XP instead of perk points (like how Borderlands 1 did it).",1625097623

However, someone did ask about whether it's worth the big debate, and I do think the debate itself is overdone..

I learned Japanese for years (with teachers) and nobody every mentioned pitch accent...and why bother? There's no real rules about it, and it's not expressed in the writing. It's basically just part of the pronunciation of each word.

If you learn vocab by speaking with native speakers, you probably never need to worry about it, because you learn the right way to say them on the intake, but if you're self-learning in a vacuum, it's a treacherous minefield.

I mentioned somewhere else in here that I think another issue with pitch accent is that I've seen several streamers mention it in the same breath as tone in tonal languages, and I don't think that's valid. Pitch accent is way more similar to syllabic emphasis in English (dessert vs desert)  than tonality in Chinese.",1625097624

Not sure how your first question follows.. 

&gt;You missed an important detail‚Ä¶ god handed Israel over to them when they worshipped other gods.

This detail isn‚Äôt that important. 

&gt;That being gods choice and action Midian is not solely to blame since god put it into motion. 

I‚Äôm not understanding your logic, and this is a red-herring. Either way, God did not tell the Midianites to commit genocide on Israel. Are you also removing accountability from Israel who went on to worship false gods?

&gt;Although that‚Äôs true, history has shown that kids taken from one environment and put into another usually adopt that new environment. 

What history? The only adoption will be through oppression. 

&gt;Take native Americans kidnapping white settlers, the white settlers raised native America usually didn‚Äôt want to return to their previous culture

I‚Äôm really not sure what you‚Äôre getting at here and how this relates. White settlers raised native America? What does that mean? Indigenous Americans just burnt down 4 Catholic Churches do you think they feel ‚Äòadopted‚Äô? 

&gt;Also also, this would‚Äôve been a good opportunity for god to show his love and be different from the world and lead these boys to him? Why couldn‚Äôt god have tried that route?

You are showing a serious lack of understanding, and it seems like you are just trying to throw a bunch of never-ending questions without thought. 

&gt;And ya.. I‚Äôm sure the Israelites asked the parents of the girls they were literally killing for proof of virginity üòÖ

"batman","t5_2qqt8","I don't *hate* Bataffleck. His costume, characterization, voice and fight choreography were great. Jeremy Iron might be my new favorite Alfred. But the fact is that Snyder didn't know what to do with him.

Like, for example, he gives up killing Superman when he realizes he has a human mother. But... Doesn't all of the other goons he kills have human mothers too? Does he research to see if each one of the criminals has a family before deciding if they deserve to die or not? The grim and traumatized Batman we see at the beginning of the movie wouldn't stop killing an alien threat just because it called for its mother.

And there's also the fact that most of his character arc happens off-screen. He breaks his rule and becomes a murderer way before the movie starts. And then he flips back to being a hero after Superman dies, but it is basically instantaneous. I mean, in 20 years of acting as Batman has he never seen a cop or paramedic die while trying to protect people? Why does Superman's death affect him so much and in such a sudden way? His whole change of heart happens in the time skip before the funeral.

And then in Justice League he is reduced to only driving the other members of the League around in his bat vehicles. Even his cool moments, having a plan to stop Superman if he comes back evil and giving Flash a pep talk, were actually Whedon additions.

So... I don't hate Bataffleck. But I do hate Zack Snyder. I would like to see Ben Affleck playing Batman again in a future movie with a better storyteller in the director's seat.",1625097625

One night, in the beginning, she went so far as to slap me across my face and call me a slit. For what? Because somewhere someone decided that divorce was evil and wrong and that I am going to hell? No matter that my ex was an abusive, cruel son of a bitch. 

We didn't go to the house, we didn't go to family events, they didn't come to my wedding. My dad would come by my work to see because if she knew he was seeing me there would be holy hell to pay.  This was not the first time she'd done this either. When my older sister  moved in with her BF at age 18 my mother disowned her and had a complete meltdown. It's wrong, the Bible says so. Ugh! 

FFWD to now. I am her primary caregiver. I take her to all of her doctor appointments, do her grocery shopping. She stays at our house, travels with us. It all just went away one day. So it begs the question what was the point? She lost all of those years and it proved nothing. 

Hang in there, hopefully your mom will see the light that you are more important than some rule written by some guy in some book years ago. Your happiness, your health and your safety should be her concern. Besides all she's doing is losing precious time and didn't this past year really show us how fragile all that is?

And I would love to hear a frankly more earnest declaration on the goals of the theory if it is meant as anything other than just an academic theory. 

Obviously these days CRT is being held up as the baseline theory behind a number of initiatives from the corporate and education sectors to push a view of institutional racism.  I am curious what the academic proponents of CRT think about the efficacy and appropriateness of these initiatives.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","Yes, the ancestors of slaves should be repaid for the past. However, I don‚Äôt quite know what the best way of going about it is.

Slaves originally were given reparations after emancipation. But very quickly, the civil rights train hit a brick wall, and southern racists were able to not only take those reparations away from former slaves and prevent any more from being given, they also changed the government and implemented laws specifically meant to target African Americans and make life harder for them financially. 

And the problem with the argument that no former slaves or slave owners exist is, the effects of slavery and racism still exist to this day, and those effects are the number one reason why blacks are among the worst off groups of people in America. Furthermore, racists from the civil rights era are still around to this day, advocating for removal of black folks‚Äô rights. My own grandfather is one of them.

So obviously *something* needs to be done - but as for what, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know very much about the economy and finances.",1625097627

"AskAcademia","t5_2sakj","I echo all of this. I am also in a tenure-track position and worked as a graduate residence assistant. 

The on-call nights could be rough, but the beautiful thing was they really only were for outside the 9-5 schedule. I was free to set my schedule during the week and they worked around my class schedule. If I had a really bad ""on-duty"" night, the leadership team let us flex our hours for the week, which meant I had a little more time to study or get work done. 

Another thing worth considering is that your schedule is likely going to be really awful before the semester starts and during/right after finals week. This is when students tend to have the most mental health issues, which can be a lot of work when you're on duty. For me, this was never a big deal, but it was kind of exhausting starting or ending the semester.

PRO:
I imagine ethnicities without a country would be happy with this map.  The Kurds for example, defended their home against ISIS when the Iraqi army retreated from there.  I‚Äôll make no comment about Iraq‚Äôs longterm military strategy, but if the Kurds fought and died to protect that land and those people, then that land is their home, and it‚Äôs a shame they get a seat in the UN and are simply a minority in other countries.  Many new countries would form to give a voice to the voiceless.

CON:
People move around.  If the world‚Äôs borders were updated when ethnicities migrate, then countries with low birth rates would shrink.  If you had enough migrant workers in an area then your country‚Äôs land could be lost permanently.  This would make a common immigrant nearly equivalent to an invading (albeit non-violent and slow moving) army.  That would give validity to the arguments of people who would otherwise be just loud, racist idiots.  It would make people more aware of their differences, and suspicious of ‚Äúothers‚Äù moving into their area.

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","thank you for your advice. I have already started a lot of side hustles. Affiliate Marketing, Dropshipping, Website Designing, Amazon E-Books, Trading... actually almost every possible one you can do at my age in Germany. Nothing was really fun for me, because I never had the feeling to really make a difference. I just copied what others were doing. I even made a fair amount of money doing it, but money wasn't that important to me. I learned dozens of skills doing it and I'm grateful for that, but side hustles are not something you should do long term in my opinion. With party and alcohol etc. I have made a lot of experience in the last few years, but in the end I am always the only one at the party who is not drunk, and I don't see any sense in doing that all the time, because I see how my friends slowly get sucked into the system just by this continuous partying and don't question much anymore and give up their dreams.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","While all the movies deal with class warfare and a corrupt government, here are some spoiler filled quick summmaries.

1st movie- home invasion with ""keeping up with the jones"" vibe. Where a rich neighborhood comes together to kill the richest people on the block who made their money sell8ng securitysystems to everyone else.
2nd movie- people (all) arent evil but government mercenaries pose as civilians to make more violence so more people purge. Causing government to look like they did right. While the super rich have purge parties and trap the poor for game. Gangs act as the heroes as they try and protect their neighborhoods from criminals only to find they are out gunned by the government.
3rd movie- normally elected officials are exempt. But when a politician runs for presidency on the grounds of stopping the purge she must hide from her own security on the streets with normal people. Helping as many people as she can while struggling to stay alive with help of ""medics"" 
4th movie(prequal)- people are paid to participate in the purge. Paid more to kill and not just do drugs, steal or have public sex. So the govenment takes advantage of the poor so they kill eachother leaving more money for the super rich.
TVshow season1- a rich couple finds their open marriage has negative impacts when the third wheel wants to nix the compition. Elsewhere big business uses the night to make big deals and break contracts. They agree not to kill eachother while in their big office buildings but theres 1 promotion and so many good candidates...

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"FloridaBarExam","t5_3jzlq","I‚Äôm a repeater and omg did I want to postpone February 2021. I barely studied and I was a hot mess the last two weeks before the exam, probably doing more crying than studying to be perfectly honest. Literally the only reason I did not postpone was because my MPRE and MBE scores were about to expire. Going into that exam I was Morgan Freeman at the end of Shawshank Redemption telling the parole committee that he didn‚Äôt give a damn anymore and I was fully aware that that was not a healthy mindset to take a test in. I was nauseous from the stress during the essay portions. 

But February was my exam. The essays were topics I could write well and had recently reviewed and my worst MC subject (business entities) was the absentee. I knew I‚Äôd owned that exam even though my damaged self confidence tried to brace me for another failure (I failed Florida 3 times, including the October 2020 dumpster fire, and it was only that I‚Äôd successfully taken and passed 2 other state bar exams that kept me going). When results were posted and I saw the ‚Äúyes‚Äù next to my number I literally burst into tears. 

This isn‚Äôt to say you shouldn‚Äôt postpone. Only you can truly say where your mental health is at and if you really think you would be better off postponing then that‚Äôs what you should do. As a repeater I can definitely say that I took the repeated fails at knives to the gut and my mental health approaching each subsequent test got progressively worse.",1625097632

"DnDHomebrew","t5_2xzpc","**Polished Armour** is way too stronk.

I would change it to something like 'at level 6, whenever you apply oil, you may spend 1 hit dice to give yourself temp hitpoints = hit dice roll + Con mod.

This gives the player essentially an unstackable heal for their bonus action at the cost of a hit dice. It honestly may also be too strong, considering they can keep pumping temp hit points in the middle of battle, but seeing as *Battlerager* gets free *Con* temp hit points for Reckless Attacking with no resource cost, I think this is pretty in line power wise. It will also still play thematically, as the oil causes blows that land to lose their impact as you just continuously dose yourself with more and more oil. Something to consider.

You would probably also want advantage on Grapple(checks) and Restrained, thematically speaking, and not Paralyze, as paralysis is caused by things happening internal, often through poisons and magic. 

**Contagious Glow** could just be when you're oiled. No need flavor or balance wise to only have it apply during a rage.

**Too Hot To Touch** doesn't need the first *additionally*. Damage types should be explicitly specified in the ability. As neat as the mechanic is to have oiled opponents ignite, that can be quite a nice tick of extra damage and it is a lot to keep track of in combat, with your character oiling someone every round they can. Keeping check on who is and isn't oiled in the middle of attacks instead of just movement could be an unexpected slow down to the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, it's hard to ignore how much more powerful a Tiefling/(Red)Dragonborn would be at this subclass than other Races, with the inherent resistance to fire damage. The ignited state gives a lot of free damage, but it does have a fair amount of drawback, so it's a bit of a toss up if it will tilt an encounter unexpectedly. Also being the most resisted damage type helps reduce its ability to steam roll.",1625097632

Meaning or truth, isn't really something I can explain or express in words to convince another person, it's something that needs to be experienced which sounds like a cliche or unverifiable thing for the scientist, but honestly when you know you know and when you get a taste of the knowing it doesn't give you powers, or psy powers, or really change much in how you live initially but it's profound and incredible.

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","I appreciate you giving me a taste of what you have thought! I'll absolutely be giving Absurdism a look. 

Question, would you say that even in the absence of necessity for a divine creator that sentience itself (what religious people would call the soul) and the recognition of subjective realities perceived only by minds that allow for sentience gives people basically an evolutionary duty to assign the concept of ""inherent value"" to themselves and others? That is to say - regardless of the truly objective, unfeeling, non-self aware, and uncaring material universe - that the mere fact that there are beings capable of self-awareness and the knowledge that there are other sentient beings is what leads to the biological necessity to feel important and valued, even in CPTSD and similar people who see through the *absurdity* of it all but can't escape that need?

It's like the acceptance that all people are sentient and that we are sentient, but we always feel like we're severely missing out or that there's some secret way to ""connect"" our sentience to that of others but it's malfunctioning. It's just such a lonely existence, and it creates a lot of mostly unconscious self-sabotage at even searching for connection because at this point I don't know if it really even exists. No matter how close I can get to someone I'll still only be in my own head.

I read the intro to absurdism and it seems to get at this, but I want to hear what you think about it.

Edit: Also we can't tell people without trauma any of this because they'll just look at us like we're crazy. Maybe they're the ones missing out. Ignorance is bliss I suppose - true happiness seems to come from not even having a concept of not having it. I would never wish them anything less than what they have but some people have no idea what the human spirit can be put through.",1625097634

At the end of the no player is bigger than the club and it simply isn't worth keeping them around after a certain age. Their wage demands are too high for the amount of playing time they'll get and the impact they'll have, and they'll delay the progress of the team by taking up a spot that a younger player who could be the future of the team could've taken.

It's not bad for the player either, they get a chance to play somewhere else, win different trophies, have new teammates and since they often move to a weaker team and/or league their ability will have more of an impact, despite their age, than it would've at their old club.

"AudioProductionDeals","t5_3ddxo","I have not, though I've heard good things about Nembrini.  I will say that I went through several Neural trials (Nolly, Plini, etc.) and was not really blown away by anything.  Then I downloaded Cory Wong and played that thing for about three hours, just having a ton of fun.  It's got really really nice presets, and works well for both rhythm and leads.  I really like it and almost never think about guitar sims anymore.

Before that I had an HX Stomp, which had the Line 6 stuff accessible through it.  I didn't like the workflow in that software and wasn't blown away by the tones.  I never use the Stomp anymore, but may dig back into if I start playing live again.

Of course it all depends on what style you are looking for.  If you want that old-school Fender clean tone there may be better choices than Cory Wong - I'm not sure.  I have a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe amp that gets me those tones when I mic it correctly so that's how I get those tones.  

Anyways, good luck!",1625097635

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","I definitely didn't say anything about greedy corporations (or about profit)..  Perhaps you're confusing me with someone else.

And what you're missing is that the board \*does\* make decisions about how to allocate funds in many cases..  The residents pay, but the board sets the agenda.  Which means that they have to decide on priorities to push, between things like cosmetic improvements (which look good for the building and might attract new owners) vs. structural repairs.   We'd have to know the history of what money has been spent on in the last few years, but recent reports indicate that there was money allocated to things like improving the lobby visually, and that the planned structural repairs might not have included the full extent of what was necessary.

Also, there are multiple reports of residents voicing concerns about the maintenance of the building, and being told by the board that the building was perfectly safe/in good condition and that everything is fine.  Some of them took videos and pictures to document their findings.

So I think the point that I raised is a valid one.  Obviously we can't condemn anyone without knowing the facts, but to say that the board doesn't ultimately carry some additional responsibility is a dubious argument at best.",1625097635

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","As a third party, I'm not tied to a specific view of anyone here, cos I don't care. Doesn't affect me personally. Like I said, it's possible to remain friends? but from a practical standpoint it's likely that issues can arise... this is an example.

That old saying ""don't mix business and family (or friendship)"" sorta holds true here. With a normal wedding venue, you can go after them for a refund, or even sue them, for disruptions to plans. In your case, your friendly gesture got mixed in with a significant 'business' arrangement - a wedding. Instead of payment and a contract, there's an exchange of trust / appreciation / etc.

Rick might be a jealous dick, as everyone on here seems to think, but it's not that simple. My ESH wasn't accusing you of being an asshole in general. It was pointing out that this situation doesn't really have a single ""he's right, she's wrong"" outcome. From some perspectives, say, Rick and his friends, you're probably the asshole.

In my opinion, you're not an asshole, but in this situation you're gonna be seen as the asshole by some. Rick is too. So is Carla. So is her friend. Hence the ESH.

Personally, I don't blame you for reneging on the offer of letting them use your property for the wedding. The offer was made as a friendly gesture to someone who is close enough to you to invite you to their wedding. If you're just gonna be treated like some stranger who's not invited, then why bother making such a generous offer? They can pay to use a venue that belongs to a stranger or some impartial business. But the takeaway is, because of the way things are shaking out between you / Rick / Carla / third party / etc. it's an ESH situation.

A few years ago I was staying at a Courtyard in Hagerstown Maryland. Right next to the mall. 

I'm working away in the lobby waiting for the bar to open so I can drink my face off. I noticed one of their meeting rooms were rented out, which is never unusual except a lot of these people didn't seem like they were there on business. 

There's three guys in suits greeting people at the door and brining them into the meeting room. The bar opens and I go get my drink. I ask the bartender if they know what's up. She tells me they're selling timeshares, and that the guys running it are there all the time and are quite rude to the staff. 

Damn. Then they start bringing people out to the lobby one party at a time. I overhear this guy really working over a couple. Literally every sleazy sales tactic you can think of. 

Then the next couple, then the next. 

Once I'm sufficiently drunk, I make my way to the front desk for a water and snack. On my way past another couple I catch eyes with the husband and mouth ""RUN"". 

As a salesman myself, it really pisses me off to see these tired old shitty tactics because it only devalues my title and makes my job harder. I don't even sell to the public, I market to educated engineers and architects.

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","So to play devil's advocate here. I'd say revisit the sexual experience in your head. Sexual performance anxiety is something that is more prevalent than ever. I'm generally a confident guy in most aspects of my life. But there have been times after our initial sexual experience  things feel awkward. Right after I ask myself ""was I good?"" ""Was she satisfied?"" ""Is SHE still interested?"" 

While all of this typically can be answered by communicating openly with one another, if we're honest that's not always the case. 

To be perfectly honest I've waited post sex to immediately communicate because I'm feeling insecure and if she text me 1st then it means it wasn't so bad and she wants to continue. 


I'm just giving you scenarios to think about and to consider as it's not always black and white. I agree with everything you said and how you feel...but it would go a long way to have a conversation before, during, or after. For me personally once I started opening up more and communicating with my partner about our sexual experience it went a long way to making me more confident about my performance. 

I do think a lot of people assume the fact that you go to bed with someone means the person should know you like them and want things to continue...thats just not always the case.",1625097640

While it sounds cliche to say this, it's really not the end if you couldn't get into a Uni. Maybe you were fated to walk down another path in life than what you wished to have, working with what you have now and prevail against the odds when the years come. As long as you don't give up, you never truly lose.

You can try by cutting down the amount of pills you take. Use the time when you are awake to heal instead of fighting reality when you are down. Take 3 meals a day and shower daily. See if you can talk to your family and tell them how you are feeling. Aim to help out in 1 household chore a day. Tidy up the place that you sleep in. At least u will get to sleep or browse Reddit in a nicer environmentüòå.

For your own safety, we recommend you only work with sellers who are verified on our subreddit. Moderators will be unable to help you if you work with unverified sellers. 

To ensure someone is verified: Ask every seller **to comment on your thread** and check that they have Verified Seller or Trusted Seller flair before continuing. If they can't comment, they may be banned. [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSexsells) with any questions about a user. **DO NOT SEND PAYMENT** until you have seen for yourself that a user is verified. A user who offers to verify for you themself on kik/cam/etc may be who they say they are, but there is no way to hold them accountable in the event that they take your payment and do not deliver services.

**Please refer to the [ban list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/wiki/bans)** before sending a seller payment, especially if they claim to be verified but have not commented on your thread. Many of the ""sellers"" messaging you who will not comment are on this list.

Perhaps they included the budget of all police departments in America and then added a million dollars for every murder, and added the healthcare costs of every gun related injury (which is inflated in price by your for-profit health care system.)  and the price of the guns purchased yearly in the United States.

Even still it might be difficult to hit that number. It's much more likely that the original number was supposed to be 280 million dollars spent yearly dealing with gun violence. Which is much more reasonable. Or even 2.8 billion dollars yearly.",1625097640

"JUSTNOMIL","t5_377ps","Per the American Association of Pediatrics ""As of June 24, over 4.03 million children [in the US] have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic."" Apparently states aren't consistently reporting numbers with comparable age ranges so I can't say how many infants were specifically infected. https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/

The Vaccine Alliance doesn't list numbers it just indicates COVID infections in infants are rare &amp; mild. It also indicates that some infants have needed mechanical ventilation. In the US that occurs in the NICU. If you've ever had a child in the NICU or even PICU you know its nerve wracking.  If you've ever known a parent whose children were admitted to the NICU/PICU you know its absolutely agony &amp; very difficult to console them. If you've ever worked or volunteered in the NICU/PICU you know that everyday the patient is there is difficult &amp; every discharge home is a reason for celebration. 
https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/covid-19-could-undermine-progress-towards-reducing-infant-mortality.

Healthdesk.org supports statements by the vaccine alliance and estimates death to be about 0-2%. It also mentions MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children) which is basically part of the long term effects children may have related to COVID. But no one knows how long it will last. It also clearly states ""Babies under the age of one year are more at risk of severe illness than older children. This is because infant immune systems are not fully developed and their airways are smaller. It is recommended that during and after childbirth, caregivers wear masks and have clean hands when caring for newborns. Reasonable distance should be maintained from newborns when possible to reduce the risk of infection."" Which is why most new moms instinctively limit who has access to their infants. 
https://health-desk.org/articles/what-do-we-know-about-infant-mortality-due-to-covid-19

UNICEF has some interesting charts that shows the rates of various age populations. https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/covid-19/

The MAYO Clinic also indicates infection rates are low (13% in US) with mostly mild cases but severe cases are most common in kids under 1y/o. https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children/art-20484405


There seems to be an increase in infant deaths related to COVID in south east Asia &amp; also Brazil.  Those are both 3rd world regions/countries and have other issues likely causing an increase in infant deaths (i.e. inadequate nutrition, poor living conditions). In healthy these are called comorbities or confounding factors. Its important not to draw a direct correlation with the US or developed nations.  But it is a reminder to do your best to provide your infant/children with a clean environment adequate food/milk/formula &amp; limit exposure to (potentially infected people).
The CDC indicates 0.1% of kids (0-5y/o) infected with COVID dies from it. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e1.htm",1625097640

Right now it has a circulating supply of 3 million at a price of $34.8. I'm pretty dumb so don't take this as  an invitation to load up on some random governance token. Fundamentally I don't understand the value of this token, but it's price action is abrupt and large. just these past few hours there has been  multiple +/-10% swings with predictable floors.

I don't know if this kind of movement has to do with it's small supply, but it seems like it doesn't take much to get the price swinging to ridiculous heights. I've been eyeballing the order book and it looks like theres some weird bot activity for sure. A lot of the time bots automatically undercut my ask price by 1 - 10 cents (similar stuff happens with bid price. it actually has made this token quite liquid) .

Just pointing out some interesting behavior that I think deserves a little more attention. go look at the charts cause this kind of shit has been going on for almost a month now. June 10th is a good place to see where this started.

Edit: lol go look at how thin the order book is right now. a few hundred dollars could move prices surprising  amounts in either direction.",1625097642

I've recently bought a replacement hip pivot bolt for my Aeron, but it appears the metal washer into which it usually screws into the seat with is stripped. The plastic part of the seat that it (used to) fit snugly into is also stripped, sadly. No grip whatsoever.    

Does anyone know the name of this washer (outlined in blue) is, so that I can find a replacement? Even so, I worry that if I find a replacement it still won't work because it wont have any plastic portion of the seat to grip onto.

Any help would be very much appreciated... the chair is totally fine otherwise, and I would lament having to buy a whole entire new seat over this. 

Thank you!",1625097643

I will then get a notification in the chart asking if I can agree with the diagnosis, add it to the patient and then detail how it may impact their current illness or hospitalization or recovery to justify billing for the diagnosis.

People of all shapes and sizes even fat people with a body mass index of 60 can meet criteria for malnutrition. I was saying in this example I don't give a f**k, please don't make me go through all the nonsense of justifying it to these CDI people.",1625097643

We have this insatiable urge to make connections that don‚Äôt exist when the narrative changes.  ‚ÄúHe changed his opinion on management; he must be 13D, and 13D must be bad.‚Äù  We shouldn‚Äôt let our imaginations run wild like that.  

Plant your feet, lean forward, make your decision, and be strong about it.  Arguing over who is on what side seems petty.  

I personally believe in accountability.  This management team still has time to be accountable for some of the promises made publicly.  I will cut them slack for inexperience and for fighting uphill battles.  They either will or they won‚Äôt follow through.  I know what my bailing point is.  It‚Äôs different than yours probably.

Cenk Uygur is one of these.

"rfelectronics","t5_2s9fi","5 MHz is definitely 'RF'. [In the US](https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/rfdevice), RF extends from 9 kHz (yes, kilohertz, as in within the audio range if it were sound waves instead of EM waves) to 3,000 GHz. 

For example, the standard AM broadcast band is from 540 kHz (0.5 MHz) to about 1710 kHz (1.71 MHz). That's lower than 5 MHz.

[Amateur radio operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_frequency_allocations#Band_characteristics) (depending on location) have allocations from around 135 kHz to over 275 GHz. That spans wavelengths of 2200m to &lt; 1mm. 

At 5 MHz you really don't need to worry about transmission lines - at that wavelength a PC trace transmission line would be HUGE. As far as RF transformers, active components, connectors, and coax, however, you should strive to match impedances. Grab a copy of the ARRL Handbook from you library and give it a read.",1625097645

"pomonacollege","t5_2spf2","Hey! 

So first off, if classes are on campus, you're going to have access to a wide array of media studies tools. I don't know how the pandemic will affect this, but there are multiple open-access computer labs (Oldenborg and other residence halls, Smith Campus Center, etc.) plus closed-access for certain departments with their preferred programs. You can also get access to extra tools like being able to rent a drawing tablet or camera for two days from the Claremont Colleges Library. So, if you don't have the \*perfect\* tools, do not at all stress!

Second, I would say the majority of students in general use Macbooks. However, I have not had great experiences with the Macbook Air so if you're gonna go for one, I'd really suggest splurging and getting a Macbook Pro. But do focus on putting your budget first priority and not stressing too much if you can't get a super fancy laptop.

We were regularly having aircraft on the ground for sometimes close to a calendar week due to export inspection and crew testing.

For ocean, you also have the cargo container shortages which are slowing stuff down before it even gets to the point of loading at a port.

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","First off that‚Äôs not HRM (Human Resource Management), but CRM (C for Customer). That‚Äôs what you use to log client information.

Second, mature CRM systems are available from the market as SaaS at a price you cannot compete against on your own. The amount of functionality they offer and the benefits of scale means your own creation won‚Äôt keep up at any front.

Try comparing it yourself by making a feature list and calculating the Total Cost of Ownership for a 5 year term. Include initial building costs, hosting, maintenance and further development.

If you want to offer the best value to your client, take a look at market solutions, find the one that best fits their needs and help with setting it up. Why? Because you don‚Äôt want a client company spending resources on what isn‚Äôt their core business. Then offer to help build something that actually generates revenue.

You can also charge royally (‚Ç¨100+/hr in Western Europe here) for this kind of work when you have some experience, because that kind of work is more consulting than development. I started at ‚Ç¨60 an hour when I was still studying. If you do it well, you‚Äôre worth the cost many times over.

I‚Äôm assuming btw that it‚Äôs a small to medium sized company with little in-house expertise. That often means they don‚Äôt have in-house IT knowledge. If you like doing a variety of jobs, focus on building a long and mutually beneficial relationship over getting that one big job now.

If you do actually need HRM, change a letter and the answer still stands.

Named after the Chemawa band of the Kalapuya people of the Willamette Valley, it opened on February 25, 1880 as an elementary school. Grades were added and dropped, and it became a fully accredited high school in 1927, when lower grades were dropped. In 2005, it continued to serve ninth through twelfth grades.

Wow, I didn't realize I was dealing with a sociopath

&gt; there aren't enough of them to warrant stuff like children wearing masks

That wasn't even in your initial argument, and I wasn't advocating for it. It's very likely that children over 6 months will be able to get vaccinated safely by October or so, at which point this attempt to move the goalposts becomes entirely moot.

&gt; They get sick from all sorts of diseases, whats so different about covid?

It's now a preventable disease, and the vaccine is so easily accessible that many states will pay you in some way to get it

&gt; Your suggestion is crazy

Smokers pay more for health insurance due to disproportionately increasing their risk, my suggestion is very similar. Far as you can be from unsubstantiated. Then again, you demonstrate crazy pretty well with:

&gt; but a more likely solution is that the unvaccinated get shunned and unable to return to a normal society, for our supposed protection. You think thats fair?

No, there is no reason to ostracize people when a 5 second injection and a 15 minute observation period would suffice.

Vaccines work. The COVID vaccines work. Not using them to save the lives of those who can't get them or for whom they are less effective is sociopathic. If you want to hurt other people, it's only right that you have to pay for it.",1625097651

&amp;#x200B;

Vielleicht hab ich ja doch ne Frage: Wie sehr nerven dich unsere wirtschaftsfrommen Parteien? Union/FDP/teilweise auch SPD. 

Was ich √ºber Armut und finanzielle Abh√§ngigkeit gelernt hab ist, dass in Deutschland ein ganze unterschwellige Kultur von Scham vorherrscht. Die Ignoranz die damit kommt entspringt dann einfach nur Uninformiertheit und Eigengefallen, die zwar menschlich sein m√∂gen, aber nat√ºrlich genau von diesem Gef√ºhl der Scham entstammen.

Deswegen explodiere ich auch fast immer bei der absoluten Selbstgef√§lligkeit mit der unsere √úberpriviligierten Wirtschaftspolitiker Dinge beschlie√üen √ºber die sie selbst keine Ahnung haben. In Armut zu leben ist eine absolute Parallelgesellschaft und es findet auch keine Aufkl√§rung √ºber die Verh√§ltnisse statt. Der Weg nach oben ist gespickt wie ein Spie√ürutenlauf von Schikanen bei denen man denken k√∂nnte sie w√§ren mit Absicht gesetzt worden. 

Und ich rede garnichtmal von der Armut in der Kindheit. 

Mit 30 studieren? Kein Baf√∂g mehr, praktisch keine F√∂rderung, keine Unterst√ºtzung. Der Staat k√ºmmert sich einfach nicht mehr.

Kein Job? Good Luck eine Wohnung zu finden. Ohne festen Wohnsitz...good luck einen Job zu finden. Kein Privatpatient? Good Luck Therapie zu finden, ohne Therapie good luck wieder fit f√ºr nen Job zu werden

Altersvorsorge. Rente ist das eine. Aber gestern hab ich √ºber den Pfusch geschrieben der unsere komplette private Alternpflege darstellt wenn man kein Geld hat. Der Staat hat sich bisher bewusst auf Schwarzarbeit ausgeruht und jeder wusste es, teilweise hat man den Alten beim dahinsiechen zuschauen k√∂nnen, wenn sie auf staatliche Hilfe angewiesen waren, jede unqualifizierte, die Sprache nicht sprechende unterbezahlte Schwarzarbeiterin hat mehr f√ºr diese Menschen leisten k√∂nnen und war gleichzeitig das einzige was man sich leisten konnte ansonsten war man ruiniert, finanziell wie emotional.

Und bei all dem sehe ich: Damit sich etwas √§ndern w√ºrde, m√ºsste ein Verst√§ndnis des Problems bestehen, Armut ist ein komplett anderes Leben in Deutschland und weil so viel Schweigen dar√ºber herrscht muss man feststellen: Die meisten k√∂nnen sich das nichtmal vorstellen. Die meisten leben in der Annahme, dass der Staat sich schon sorgen w√ºrde, wenn es so weit w√§re. 90% der Leute sind wie Versicherungsnehmer...in der festen Annahme, dass im Fall der F√§lle ja eine Versicherung besteht :P Es herrscht √ºberhaupt nicht genug Sympathie f√ºr √Ñnderungen, weil unsere wirtschaftsgesteuerten Politiker oben stehen und sich selbst preisen f√ºr all das was sie wohlt√§tig √ºbersozial ausgeben, wie die Minijobs die zwar den gr√∂√üten Markt in Europa geschaffen haben f√ºr Leute die sich w√§hrend des Arbeitens ein Leben nicht leisten k√∂nnen...aber gleichzeitig ist ja die Arbeitslosigkeit so stark zur√ºckgegangen...ein riesen Erfolg...nur dass es halt 10000 solcher Sachen sind die als ""aber das ist doch was positives, es wird doch geholfen"" verkauft wird ""was mehr sollen wir ihnen denn noch geben den Schmarotzern"", w√§hrend gleichzeitig jeglicher Aufstieg so schwer wie m√∂glich gemacht wird.",1625097651

I know this sounds harsh, but for a couple days, re-serve what she left and tell her she can finish this if she's hungry but that's it until next meal. She may not eat it and have a tantrum,  but She really won't go hungry. If she truly is hungry she will eat the leftovers or eat more at next meal. If you keep this up, there really will be no end in sight for this.

And I understand how hard this is to apply. We don't want our kids being hungry or screaming. We love them and this makes it so much harder to do. I do this with my 1 year old. Some days he eats everything and some days he just throws food on the floor. I used to try making 3 different things to get him to eat just a few bites. But now I don't. My husband gets upset and my parents try to force feed him but I have been putting my foot down for 2 weeks. And now he's been eating what I put in front of him and he's been eating at daycare too. It was hard, mama, believe me. I felt so much guilt that I'm not letting my son eat and I am abusing him!

For example, NECC also partners with another school to give staff a special ed degree. if those staff also want their BCBA, they can take 6 extra courses (I think) to qualify. 

If you're looking into programs, make sure to look into the facility because there are definitely some that are younger and seem to be in it more for the money than educating people. 

I know there are a few nice online programs as well. If you're worried about the price, reach out to your employer to see if they'll reimburse some of it. Some companies are willing to do part or all of it depending on how long you've been working for them. I hope that helps.",1625097652

"Missing411","t5_31d2x","I have lived at Ft. Lee in Petersburg, Va and had an encounter, worked at John Umstead Hospital in Butner, NC and had one, had Several while working 3rd shift doing security at Duke University Campus. Had several while at home in Fayetteville, NC. One while on a trail ride sleep over near Bethesda, Maryland. One on my way to work on I-295 in Fayetteville. SeverL at my other house in Oxford, NC. My Dad, my daughter and several other family members have them and no one can explain them. They can not explain why they occur. I have seen, heard and felt entities around me and why I do not know. I had one mind speaking to me and say it was not my time yet, and that he has plans for me. No one can explain these encounters but my Dad called me crazy when I told him. Yes I saw a mental health Dr after that but my Dad could not explain what happened and is happening to him. These beings visit him every night. They mess with his feet and hit him and he tells me. Never once did he say he was mentally ill. In this world some unforeseen force is at work. I have seen them appear and disappear out of thin air. I have heard them crawl up a building in the back of me. I have heard them throw rocks, and clear their throat to get my attention, I have heard them act like barred owls but yet they are not. I have seen a giant monkey sit near me behind a dumpster cross his legs and look across the street. As the night turned to day he simply faded away right before my eyes. I have heard one mind speaking and say they are hear to protect me, from what I do not know. I do know there are mysteries of this world that we do not know right in front of our face but we do not see them unless the want to be seen.

Everyone will at some point in their life run into a crying kid whether it‚Äôs at the theatre, restaurant, airplane, mall, etc. It‚Äôs a part of life. We are not asking you to babysit for us in public, just asking for a little bit of patience.

If it looks like the parent is trying their best to handle the situation and still failing, cut them some slack. If they seem to be ignoring the kid and letting them run rampant, then by all means get upset.

Edit: And just as a side note. Parents shouldn‚Äôt take their crying kids to public places if they can handle it. Like restaurants, theatre, etc. My husband and I know that our 4 month old cries every night between 6-9. We are considerate and never eat dinner out because we know that he will be a bothersome.

However, because college mainly refers to undergraduate level education, people will sort of use the term college to refer to undergraduate level education regardless of whether said program is at a true college, or a university. I.e. I did my bachelors degree at a university technically, but most americans would consider those my ""college years"" while I was pursuing that degree.

"furry_irl","t5_3b66u","&gt;I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

That means you never leave shoes on the ground. That means if you aren't watching puppy, they are in a crate, or a pen, or on a tie out lead. That means supply lots of approved chews in a variety of textures - if puppy is chewing table legs, get a wooden chewtoy. If they're chewing clothes, get more plush toys.

Puppy doesn't understand why you're shouting no - they just know they were having a good chew, and you started yelling, so if they want to have a good chew they need to make sure you don't see them. Hide from the human, cause they're shouty and weird.",1625097654

\*Temple of Artemis and Floating Gardens both give +15% to food. This is applied before your pop eats food, so if you have 5pop. and you produce 12 food, normally the 5 pop eats ten and the remaining two go to making new pop. Swords into Plowshares(religious belief), and the tradition policy apply their bonus after citizens eat so in our example it would be applied to the two food. Temple of Artemis and Floating Gardens apply before so you get 15% on 12 food instead of on 2 food. In that example Artemis and f. gardens are 6 times better than other growth bonuses and policies and the gap gets more extreme the more food you are producing.",1625097655

The in-game tutorials all blow chunks, but it's pretty easy to just jump into Tekken and fuck around and have some fun. And if you want to git gud, there's a pretty insane amount of information available online in a variety of formats for you to learn about bread and button moves, frame data, and any of that more advanced stuff

I also think Tekken has the coolest competitive scene of any fighting game, if that ups your enjoyment at all. Even as a Japanese-American who prefers to root for Japanese and Americans in fighting games... Watching players like Knee and Arslan Ash is just so fucking cool, and I think having a wider diversity of regions represented in the pro scene gives Tekken a special flair.",1625097655

Yeah, glass isn't perfectly transparent, eventually, an inch thick or whatever, it's going to noticeably block some percentage of the light. But just 2 layers? Considering the opposite side was already transparent anyway (and letting light through from inside the house), and aluminum is a heat sink?

I guess misting the window (aluminum) from the inside would help soak up some of this heat.

So what? That's still a hell of a lot of Americans. Besides there are other types of pension plans, like the military retirement plan after 20 years (which is currently being phased out in favor of a 401k type plan), government workers Thrift Savings Plan, etc. 

&gt;So why on earth give more to people who already have tons? 

Because everyone wins? If you want to crack down on the rich, you need to do it in other ways. But in the past, history shows too heavy of a crackdown causes them to flee to more accommodating countries, taking a lot of wealth and jobs with them. 

&gt; If millions of Americans depended on pensions instead of 401ks, a whole lot more Americans would be better off and also not dependent on a stock market volatile asset like a 401k. 

Then what would you suggest? You can put your money in a savings account or buy govt bonds, which is more safe in the short term, but if you look at any 401k or even mutual fund, they always outperform those in the long run. 401ks are really not that volatile.

During the Cold War, the American public consciousness was pumped full of fearmongering about communism and socialism, so all a pundit has to do is call universal healthcare ""socialist"" and people will immediately start to have bad feelings about the idea.

Otherwise, they may have a rational reason to dislike it if they stand to be personally inconvenienced or lose money from it. While most proposed plans for universal healthcare would save money and increase healthcare accessibility for most Americans, people who are already well-off with great access to healthcare due to a good private insurance plan might actually find a universal healthcare system less accessible than what they're used to, or their loss of disposable income from increased taxes might exceed what they save in healthcare/insurance bills. They also may stand to lose money or have their job become more complicated if they work in healthcare or a related industry.

All told, though, the majority of Americans are actually in support of universal healthcare. It's a common misconception that most of us don't want it.

 &gt;Denazification (German: Entnazifizierung) was an Allied initiative to rid German and Austrian society, culture, press, economy, judiciary, and politics of the national socialist ideology following the Second World War. It was carried out by removing those who had been Nazi Party or SS members  from positions of power and influence and by disbanding or rendering impotent the organizations associated with Nazism. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the war and was solidified by the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945.

I do think companies that rely on contractors with vehicles to create most of their income should have their labor practices scrutinized because it's definitely and exploitative model. But let's go one step higher; we're in an economy where people are compelled to make ends meet using this exploitative model, usually at an overall loss to them (wear and tear on vehicles, insurance costs, opportunity cost of time that could be invested in advancing their future goals). We need better jobs and better worker protections. Let's start with nationalized universal health care for one. Then maybe investment in public infrastructure to create meaningful jobs with good benefits.

&gt; Robinhood Financial will pay nearly $70m to settle a wide range of allegations, including that it gave customers misleading information and improperly allowed some users to make riskier trades after they lied about their trading experience.

&gt; Vlad Tenev, chief executive officer and co-founder of Robinhood Markets Inc, testified virtually during a United States House Financial Services Committee hearing on February 18, 2021 about the GameStop saga In its settlement, Robinhood will pay a $57m fine and pay another $12.6m to thousands of its customers.

&gt; Last year, Robinhood agreed to pay $65m to settle accusations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose the full details of its dealings with high-speed traders and didn&amp;#039;t get the best prices for customers trading on its app.

But if God wants to use online dating to help you find a spouse I wouldnt be so quick to dismiss it. 

Be patient, You might be ready, but your future husband might not be at that point yet. Start praying for them daily.  At a very specific date the Lord gave me a word to start praying about something specific for my future wife. I was confused by it but I submitted. At the same time I started praying, she left her life of Sin and became a Christian. A year later we met and several years later  we talked about this situation and the time I started praying for her is when she got free from that specific sin. 

There is hope. Seek the Lord. Pray. Go out and meet people. Just dont settle for someone not meant for you. Also, be patient, the Lord knows your needs.",1625097661

Our cultures are similar enough that the prestige and market forces should be roughly equivalent. I also have no other explanation for the fact that American voters seem ok with more exploitative work conditions and less of a safety net.

So you get more local support for rebels who originate from their own localities in Afghanistan, with the wealthy classes being more westernized and disliked.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","So one suggestion for her might be to try to do intercrural sex instead of actual piv. Tl dr, for that, you basically are hot dogging between her thighs/labia from behind, not actually penetrating her. One benefit from this is that it's often waaaay more stimulating for her clit and hey, no painful piv. Just make sure to use lube to avoid chaffing. 

Other ways to be dominant don't necessarily have to involve piv. Sometimes, it's literally just being rougher during normal stuff. For example, pinning her down when you're giving her oral (forcing her legs open, tying her hands up, etc), throwing her onto the bed (carefully) when things heat up, maybe pulling her hair (pulling from the roots, not the tips) or taking more control if she's going down on you, etc. Restraints, more aggressive dirty talk, ordering her around, etc can all be dom stuff. You might want to check out the bdsm subs. You can definitely set a scene/tone by changing the way you talk.

I would maybe have a discussion with her on what she's cool with pain wise from sex. Some kinkier folks with vaginal issues are happy to have rushed/aggressive sex even if it hurts (or, well, that's part of the appeal lol). Other women, not so much  Having a safe word or a way to descalate might be a good idea too. 

You sound like a nice, considerate bf and I'm sure you guys can figure it out. You just might need to have a sit down and see what she wants versus what's possible. She has to be able to verbalize what worked for her before.",1625097662

"MnGuns","t5_2wxh7","Suicide is preventable. In 2019, approximately 47,500 lives were attributed to suicide. From 2018 to 2019, the suicide rate declined for the first time in more than a decade.

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008a1.htm

Rates in 2019 were highest among persons aged ‚â•85 years (20.1 per 100,000), with counts highest among persons aged 55‚Äì64 years (8,238) (Table).

*Old people living in despair.*

In 2019, the largest proportion of suicides occurred by use of firearms (50.4%), with a rate of 6.8 per 100,000. Whereas males were most likely to die from a firearm-related injury (55.6%) females were equally likely to die from firearm use (31.4%), poisoning (30.0%), and suffocation (e.g., hanging) (29.0%). The rate of firearm suicides *declined significantly* from 2018 to 2019, by 2.9% ....

The CDC is claiming a total of 47,500 and that 50.4% are from Firearms. That means 23,940 firearm suicide. 

- CDC - Firearm and other Death - 2019 - (39,707) -
- https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm

That makes the current rate of 60.3%. 

According to the data, there were 38,882 deaths by firearms in 2017, and 23,854 were suicides. That comes to 61.4% - a little lower than Miyares‚Äô figure.

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/21/jason-miyares/62-us-gun-deaths-are-suicides/

So, currently about 62%. However, these are based on News Article, not necessarily credible govt sources. 

So, yes currently is it in the 60% to 65% range, but that is still more than half.

363 murdered by Rifles and 23,940 dead by their own hand ... from firearms.

47,500 dead by suicide over all, meaning that roughly half the people who kill themselves do NOT use firearms. 

I think we could move those suicide numbers far easier than we can move the general homicide numbers. Especially when a Substantial number of those Homicide are Criminal-on-Criminal. 

As just as a side note, 95,000 die each year from Alcohol related causes -

Alcohol Deaths in the USA - 95,000/yr 261/day - CDC -

All that pressure forces nutrients and fluids out of the blood into the surrounding tissues. The capillaries then link up with the veins to carry the depleted blood back to the heart. It's like the mailman leaving their van (a red blood cell) and delivering your mail on a footpath because the van can't leave the road (the capillary).

Thing is, this is a survey of porn users, so while there might be differences in terms of degrees, everyone who answered uses porn to some degree at a bare minimum. If they don't consume porn they don't show up in the survey.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;- Younger people are more politically radical, since they treat political labels like hogwarts houses, because it's cooler to larp as an alt-right/antifa soldier than a centrist or a liberal

Yes, the interesting bit is if the distribution we're seeing is due to different age groups leading to different views, or different economic situations leading to different views.

It‚Äôs currently a form of media making academics and scholars look at fandom, online communities, and law differently, or at least in shades of gray they‚Äôve never considered before.

And yes I think its bad to waste that much time when there are more fulfilling and life-enriching activities to pursue. But thats a personal assessment about what kind of life do I want to have? I want to pursue activities that don‚Äôt just feel good in the moment (candy) but that make you feel good about yourself and proud of the time you‚Äôve spent doing it. Hell I‚Äôve looked back on 8 hour sessions of CS and gone damn that was fun *in the moment*but did I really need 8 games in a row? Lol. 

Of course, Life‚Äôs not always so serious so sure , kick back every now and then. But I think a life well lived would keep that super mindless time wasty shit (especially with a social media element) to a minimum. 

And regarding whether ‚Äúanyone argues against this‚Äù - I think you‚Äôre wrong. I think reddit generally resists ‚Äúmoralizing‚Äù or criticizing any aspects of what folks do with their free time.

This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

The old Catholic Church across the street was a focal point of the Mission. In planning and developing the golf course it is very likely the graveyard location was known and taken into account, otherwise at least some of the 182 burial sites would likely have been tragically disturbed.",1625097664

If you search long and hard enough, you learn the following:

* Effort and cost are wholly concentrated on maintaining the data network, and charging consumers for it.  Talk and text are non-starters now.  On these digital networks, talk and text are services that ultimately ride atop the data network.  If you're paying for talk or text, you're being taken advantage of.
* Data ... ""gigs"" ... are a commodity among the network operators and the MNVOs (resellers).  Do enough math among them all and you realize that there's a ""going rate"" for a gigabyte, and any talk about ""unlimited"" either has restrictions or bets against the customer fully taking advantage of what ""unlimited"" really means.  Between budget MVNOs like Mint, Tello, USMobile and the like, I gauge the current unrestricted rate at about $3/Gb in bulk.  
* ""Use it or lose it"" ... It is fairly difficult to find a plan without some sort of restriction that has you forfeit data if it's not completely used during your billing cycle.  MVNO DENT Wireless actually recognizes this as core to its business plan: you can ""sell"" unused data at month's end.
* The big networks leverage the cat and mouse game between phone and network to their advantage: 5G? You need a new phone. 2G? Retired, so you need a new phone.  Moving from AT&amp;T to Sprint?  You need a new phone.  Want the latest Samsung?  Only available at Carrier X.  Europe and Canada have more, smaller, players that all use the same GSM+LTE tech.  No hostage situations there, for the most part.  Shall I even mention ""contracts"" and ""payment plans"" that do not allow you to unlock your phone until it's paid off?  Why is it even locked to begin with?
* Network providers have been slow to take up new ""eSIM"" technology because it makes it MUCH easier to bounce between carriers.  An eSIM phone doesn't even require you to visit a store to activate.",1625097664
"popping","t5_2s2wi","So a lot of these videos are from Vietnam and the surrounding areas.

Spesific to this, it might be because of the use of Agent Orange.
Agent orange causes a spesific type of acne/other very similar skin condition that resembles acne. And its still a problem to this day. 

Combine that with low access to actual doctors  (usually the only place to go is a beauty clinic/spa where they just do extractions and not real treatments) and a whole host of other factors, like poverty, and boom. This.

It's honestly upsetting, because I think the skin condition caused by agent orange is really hard to treat (compared to regular acne).",1625097665

These demoralize our staff

\-------

Interesting, you‚Äôre worried about your staff being demoralized. I had to go see a therapist and take antidepressants. But let‚Äôs make it about you.   
  
3:00  
They‚Äôre clearly false, exaggerated with hostility   
And there‚Äôs genuinely mistreated and hurt 

\-------  
I think you, as a Pastor, should start from the assumption that all of these are genuine hurt and mistreatment, not dismissing some of them outright as exaggerated or anything else.   
5:45  
It‚Äôs not good to hold on to your grievance and be bitter   
The staff or whoever was involved  won‚Äôt have a hard time seeing they‚Äôre wrong   
Mathew 18 - go show him his wrong   
I‚Äôll receive you with openness   
\-------

GP has a pattern of telling the abused to just ‚Äúget over it‚Äô or ‚Äúlet go of their past.‚Äù It has a lot less weight when they‚Äôre the ones doing the abusing.   
This is what I feel like when I tell GP about my grievances. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm walking with someone in the woods and I step on a nail. I tell the other person I have a nail stuck in my foot, help me pull it out. They say, stop being bitter about the past and holding onto your grievances. And I say, I‚Äôm bleeding out, I probably need to go to the hospital to get a tetanus shot and antibiotics, we need to do something about the nail. And the other person says I need to be more grateful, there are people suffering more than me in some foreign land. Why, Jesus had several nails stuck in him, you should be glad you have this cross to bear. And I say again, I have a nail stuck in my foot, we need to do something about it first. And the other person says, have some thoughts and prayers. I could keep going but I think you get the point.   
  
I have my own personal story of how staff gave me bad advice that almost led to me being held back in my class a year. That would‚Äôve led to an extra year of tuition payments, a year longer to graduate, etc. At the end of all that, not a single staff member, including senior pastors and JDSNs that advised me offered an apology after I explained what happened in great length.They were also quick to throw other people under the bus. It was during the 2006 schism so maybe that is what they did back then. Yeah, I‚Äôm that old.",1625097665

"isekaidemonwaifu","t5_45p8rc","Sad to say, but the only thing I know is that a sub's combat power is determined by their military talent and level. That's from the game and you know how bad it is at explaining things.

You can focus on one sub or group (humanoid, port orsin, etc). Scrolls help with military gains but it's a good idea to use them on 1 star talents since they're 100% success. Of course using a universal scroll or 5-6 star book can be used for 100% success as well. 

Kindred that increase military for a certain group will help as well. After it's awakening, it's more beneficial to awaken it to its maximum than actually leveling up the kindred to that level cap first.

Potions work as well, but you may want to wait until the subordinate you are mostly focusing on, their consort's affection gets to where you can put levels in the blessings that go up by a percentage. Not a requirement, but it does give them a small boost when it is used. For instance, my Fiadi's Trade is 10%. When I use a lvl 1 trade pot, she gets 110 instead of 100.

Except no hard data I have found backs up the claim that it‚Äôs Muslim refugees to blame. There‚Äôs anecdotal stories but anecdotal stories are countered by other anecdotal stories. Muslims aren‚Äôt going around painting swastikas that‚Äôs for sure. 

Are you entirely unaware how General Islamophobia accuses Muslim‚Äôs of anti-semitism with little to no evidence as justification for passing laws and restrictions against Muslims? So a Palestinian Rights March will be shut down under claims of, ‚Äúanti-Semitism,‚Äù as if Israel speaks for all Jews (which in itself is anti-Semitic).

I have dealt with many anti-semites both online and in person. The amount of anti-semites I have dealt with who are Muslim are a slim minority. The reason for this is that most Muslim‚Äôs condemn anti-semitism either out of a sense of Humanism, proper understanding of the Qu‚Äôran, or if you want to be cynical practicality.",1625097666

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","&gt;  I‚Äôve recently learnt 5 different modes of the major scale throughout the neck.

Do you mean the major scale or the major *pentatonic* scale? Just curious, cause this made me think you learned the pentatonic   scale, when the major scale should have 7 total modes.

----
Anyways, Short-hand method - If you know the C major scale (CDEFGAB), then you know the A minor scale (ABCEDFG). **A minor** is a mode of **C major** scale.

Long answer - You'll have to remember the interval spacings between them.

    --Major scale
    WWHWWWH
    --Minor scale
    WHWWHWW

Another way to see it

       WWHWWWH   --Major
     WHWWHWW     --Minor

Notice the pattern, when you repeat it over and over, is the same. The difference is where you start.

There is also another to think of it: in terms of degrees, and sharps and flats. If you know your degrees, the minor scale is a flat-3rd, flat-6th, and flat-7th (compared to the major scale). This is probably more useful when you start to work with modes even more, or other scales (flat-2nd, sharpened 4th, etc.). I'm not too familiar  with this  method myself,  I'm just a bit aware of it.",1625097667

I'm not so much trying to push a specific military idea so much as too many disruptive players hitting at once.

"rheumatoid","t5_2tqwy","Yup, normal for seronegative RA. My first rheum wasn't sure I had RA but he didn't know what I had -- I was negative for all the autoimmune tests. He put me on RA meds, kind of just to see if it worked. It did, so we went with an RA diagnosis. Every now and then over the years he would test me for other things if he had a wild hair because I never had visible swelling, morning stiffness or redness. I just had pain. But the RA meds worked and all the other tests were negative, so that was that.

BTW, I'm on hydroxycholoroquine (name brand is Plaquenil so you may hear people talk about it that way) and it's absolutely my favorite RA medication. I've tried a bunch of the biologics and none of them worked as well for me as good old fashioned HCQ. I also did well on methotrexate, another oldie but goodie. I can't tolerate it anymore but if your doc wants to add that to the mix or change to that, it's a standard treatment and it works well for a lot of people. After years of being on it, it started giving me chronic headaches and vertigo, so now I can't take it anymore but I wish I could. MTX and HCQ together was the perfect combo for me.",1625097669

"IndiaSpeaks","t5_3d4x4","A Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.

In this scheme, there is no early and recent investor concept. A student takes a loan only for the purpose of education. Instead of a financial institution that will require a guarantor, the state govt itself is the guarantor. 

There is still scope for fraud as exists with any scheme. For example, someone takes the loan and does not return the money. What is the recourse? Someone who is not a student takes loan simply because he knows the powers that be. Someone takes a loan but does not spend it on education.

Even assuming the above happen for a percentage of borrowers, it can help students who cannot afford to pay for education nor have got admission to an IIT or an IIM to easily get a favourable loan. Bengal's best resource has traditionally been educated human resource. This scheme can build on that advantage. Politically, it makes sense for her just like some of the earlier schemes like Kanyashri did. Those who benefit from it would show political loyalty in the ballot box in the coming years.",1625097669

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Cannabis use disorder affects about 10% of people that smoke it, which is low compared to alcohol, cocaine and heroin but very high compared to drugs like LSD and psilocybin. It causes physiological withdrawals and dependence.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Some ways to check if you're in emotionally abusive relationship: 

1. You feel confused by his actions.
One minute he's sweet, other he blows up over the tiniest thing. Things he says or does don't make sense to you and it's hard to articulate why

2. You don't feel as if the conflict is resolved
When you fight, you never feel like he has heard your thoughts or concerns. Talking to him about some issues is like talking to a wall

3. You feel relieved when you're home alone
Feeling as if the pressure lifted, like you don't need to keep appearance anymore. When he's back you're back on your ""best behavior"" so you don't ""accidentally set him off""

4. You argue ""Me vs You"" and not ""Us vs The Problem""
He makes any issue that you bring up as your (or his) character flaw and instead of asking ""how can I help"" takes offence/insults you

5. Change the perspective. What if your friend told you this story like it happened to her instead? Would you be concerned for her? Would you tell her to run?

That would explain why you are suddenly experiencing such gastrointestinal discomfort: your underfed gut bacteria are doing a poor job of digesting your latest meal.

I'm no gastroenterologist, of course. All I know is that it's important to eat a diverse range of foods so that your gut flora can be adequately diverse. I surmise that, in time, your gut flora will recover without special intervention. If you want to speed the ball, perhaps you could try consuming more probiotic foods, like yogurt, kefir, kombucha, pickles, etc.

And lastly, I can hardly coach you on matters of ""guilt."" I have never extended ethical considerations towards my food. Perhaps you should consider the fact that we are omnivorous species, and by your own first hand experience, you know that we cannot thrive without animal products. There's no sense in feeling guilt about something you cannot control. I'm not guilty about eating meat for the same reason I'm not guilty about breathing.",1625097672

"intermittentfasting","t5_2tluu","Two things, mainly. Mental endurance and fat/keto.

I try to take a 48 hour fast once a month, to remind myself of what hunger actually feels like. It gives perspective into what we usually think of as hunger is really just cravings. The feeling / pain from being ""hungry"" comes in waves, and then passes.

The other thing is that meals high in fat and low in carbs will help keep me sated during my fast. I don't do keto (but I am convinced that it would help tremendously with not being hungry), but I do make sure that my biggest meal of the day is high fat and low carb, and that the last thing I eat in a day is some yoghurt, some boiled eggs with butter or something else that's high in fat and protein, but low in carbs. So no sugary deserts, no sandwiches, no pasta. If I want carbs, I'll have them, but they won't be the biggest meal I have, and they won't be the last meal I have.

"AirForceRecruits","t5_2q94jn","&gt;Just wanted to give you more factors at why you aren't making the best decision going 6 years vs 4.

You have no idea whether 4 or 6 years will be the best decision for them. 6 years might not be the best decision *for you*, but you are not this person and don't know what's best for them. What's risky for you may not be a worry for them.

Even as a recruiter I don't tell people what's best for them, because I don't know. I give them info between 4 and 6 years and let them decide when they ship out. I don't care what decision they make and don't even ask them. I just make sure they know the differences and don't have any questions.

&gt;You lose out on earlier re enlistment bonus if your afsc has one. Over a 20 year career, it adds up

Reenlistment bonuses are a crap shoot to base your enlistment timeframe on. They might not exist at your 4 year mark and they might be awesome at your 6 year mark (guess who that happened to) or vice versa. They change all the time (except for certain career fields).

&gt;You don't know how leadership is at your first duty station.

Officers typically change every two years, so if you're leadership sucks, it's likely they'll be gone within 2 years. If your supervision sucks, it'll depend on your career field and base, but most jobs try and rotate people if the career field allows it. In Germany, I worked 3 different sections of my career field in 5 years, so I went through a lot of different supervisors. At Langley, I could only be in one section, so I was unable to move in that job.

&gt;You might not even like your job

Some people don't care about the job and the benefits are worth more than any job they could be doing. I came in the Air Force with a computer networking degree and got ""stuck"" loading planes. It wasn't my ideal job, but anything was better than what I had going in the civilian world.

That's awesome on static missions, like mobile defence, or defence, where you just pop your skills and sit down to play some shawzin.


The other thing he's doing great job at is not taking damage. You can literally just roll yourself into limbo, run safely to exit or easily escape close death.

I may be biased, but i love limbo mainly because of that invincibility - you litterally have your own dimension, where you're safe. 

TL, DR: Limbo have his own safe dimension and can litterally freeze time in entire room, so he's best when he can do it to benefit the team (mainly defence and mobile defence)",1625097674

I do use over-the-counter soft fabric ankle supports and Dr Marten type combat boots to help my floppy ankle (I don't toe walk but I walk on the outside side edge of my foot) and minimise falls -without them I fall quite a bit and stagger about a lot. I have issues with hand tremors and pain, but I try as much as I can to 'pass' as able. People do pick up that something is up, I get the occasional comment on my walking, and also on my tremors. People do pick up that I'm 'not quite right' and I have experienced discrimination and hostility around that, especially professionally, and when I was a child, at school (I was undiagnosed until adulthood despite the signs being there). I very much fall into that not seen as disabled but also not quite able to be entirely able, if you know what I mean. Sometimes I feel fed up with and so over with the struggle I have to be seen as equal to everyone else. I'm 36, and I've been having to fight this my whole life. I'm just tired.

"awfuleverything","t5_346d4","Yeah I get all that, but obviously the business owners  would have lost a lot more financially than they're own staff members, and the majority of those will be in the two generations above.

I don't question they're significance but for them to have taken the biggest loss, they would also have to be some of the highest earners, and thats not the case.  

I'm not trying to make anything out of it, I just find it highly unlikely that they were of the most affected financially. At least where I'm from anyway, that just doesn't add up at all. Most people under 25 here were only on zero hour/part time contracts to begin with.",1625097675

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","The problem is, every single one of the examples you can give are against New World amateurs. Yet we have definitive proof that Enel really isn't as quick or strong as what you might think. Pagaya was quick enough to notice the attack and throw Conis out of the way. Hell he survived the attack and he's not even remotely strong. Sanji was quick enough to intervene with Usopp and kick him out of the way. Gandalf was able to save Conis before his attack reached her. He's fast and his attacks are powerful yet you are giving far too much credit to him. And yes his fruit certainly has the capability to destroy an entire island yet this is an island filled with people who couldn't contest him. Hell Vander Decken nearly destroyed Fishman Island. Luffy near enough split Dressrosa in two. Pica fucked Dressrosa up as well. How destructive a fruit can be doesn't entirely determine how strong an individual is. The simple fact is you put someone ie Vergo against Enel and what does he do. If Pagaya is fast enough to react against Enel's attack then someone like Vergo would have no problem. And I would argue that Vergo would very likely be able to take out Skypiea Luffy so why wouldn't he be able to defeat Enel as well? Also what do you mean Enel can see the future?",1625097676

I‚Äôll call in the morning.‚Äù and she then says ‚ÄúWell I don‚Äôt mean when their fuckin closed now do I? Of course I meant when their open!‚Äù And at that point I think my anger was more reactionary. I threw my drivers ed book (a very thin leaflet looking thing) at my wall once I was in my room. 

The other time was when I was going to make a cake, and I was turning the cake out the pan. Well, in doing so, it cracked in two. And at that point I dug my hands into the cake and threw it (not the pan) into the wall and glowered at the oven. I seriously considered putting my foot through the oven door.",1625097677

Put yourself in your officers' and members' shoes. TM should be fun, not work. Remember, your officers have other priorities beyond TM, so don't expect the kind of commitment you would from colleagues at work. Only call officers' meetings when absolutely necessary, and give the agenda beforehand. Most of the time, just communicate informally in a chat group and/or when you see eachother. Be respectful of people's time.

Remember it's a gift, and if the other person is a good kisser he might end up kissing you a lot more than just for a quick kiss.

Once you're comfortable with the whole thing you should do more things.  Be open about it with your friends.  My wife and I are open about our sex lives, and we've never had any problems.

When you're comfortable, let him know you're comfortable.  Let him know you want to share, and you want him to share with you.  Make it a big deal, that's the only way you'll be comfortable.

Also, I'm sure this is going to sound weird, but try to make it clear to him that he's not the first person you've been with.

&gt;*The Immaterial World (arupa-loka*). Consists of four realms that are accessible to those who pass away while meditating in the formless jhanas.  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Fine-Material World (rupa-loka)*. Consists of sixteen realms whose inhabitants (the devas) experience extremely refined degrees of mental pleasure. **These realms are accessible to those who have attained at least some level of jhana and who have thereby managed to (temporarily) suppress hatred and ill-will. They are said to possess extremely refined bodies of pure light.** The highest of these realms, the Pure Abodes, are accessible only to those who have attained to ""non-returning,"" the third stage of Awakening. The Fine-Material World and the Immaterial World together constitute the ""heavens"" (sagga).  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Sensuous World (kama-loka)*. Consists of eleven realms in which experience ‚Äî both pleasurable and not ‚Äî is dominated by the five senses. Seven of these realms are favorable destinations, and include our own human realm as well as several realms occupied by devas. The lowest realms are the four ""bad"" destinations, which include the animal and hell realms.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"autism","t5_2qhs6","Autistic children have a lot of difficulty with change, so they will probably be uneasy for a while.

In general, try to keep things as if you weren't there. Let the child come to you for interactions.

General Rules:

   Don't punish stimming or ""tantrums"". Autistic people often have repetitive behaviours which compensate for sensory processing deficits. If they do something repeatedly, assume it is this unless told otherwise. Forcing the child not to stim is abusive and will cause lifelong harm (it's painful for us). ""Tantrums"" in autistic children are often ""meltdowns"" which are like panic attacks and completely out of the child's control.

    They may have a set routine. Don't disturb this. We often compensate for difficulty adapting to environments or understanding our bodies by creating routines.

    If the child wants to leave and be alone, let them. Not being able to escape an overwhelming situation often causes a meltdown.

    Ask the parent about the child's ""special interests"" and ""safe foods"". Special interests can be used to calm and excite the child. Safe foods are foods they can eat without experiencing distress (we're picky for neurological reasons).

   Ask the parents about any special routines or care.

   Ask the parents what to do in case of a meltdown. (Note: /*never*/ hold the child down on their stomach. People do this for some reason and it can suffocate the child even if their face is uncovered.)",1625097680

"parrots","t5_2qhyf","Birds are more sensitive to certain kinds of fumes, etc, than other animals.  And polymer clay (all brands/lines of it, not just the 13 lines of the Sculpey brand) puts out an odor plus a small amount of vaporized ""fumes"" while it's baking.    
Some clayers don't particularly love the odor, but others may not have very good ventilation where they're baking their clay, so either group may do their baking in a garage or another room or move themselves away from the baking room, or they may do ""completely-enclosed"" baking to prevent both. 

Parrots are larger birds though so they wouldn't be affected as soon or much as tiny birds in those situations of low-ventilation, but you might want to take it into consideration.

You can get more info on enclosed-baking if you're interested on the Baking page of my polymer clay encyclopedia site if you can't increase the ventilation or can't move the bird or the oven (e.g., a toaster oven) to another room :  
http://glassattic.com/polymer/baking.htm  
-&gt; Darkening, Scorching, Burning &gt;&gt; Enclosed Baking (Completely Enclosed)

The most common baking surfaces for polymer clay won't generally create fumes while curing the clay: piece of ordinary paper on a metal baking tray, terra cotta tile, glass casserole dish (also with paper or a tissue, etc, on top to keep the clay from getting shiny spots anywhere it was in direct contact with that very smooth and non-porous material), piles of cornstarch or toilet paper, etc, etc.

"RPChristians","t5_3mkeu","This is my first time posting here, long time perusing. I feel like I need to engage here and start getting serious (should have done this 16 years ago...) and actually read, integrate, and implement what I find here. Thanks in advance for the fellowship, resources, and counsel.

PHYSICAL: I'm the heaviest I've ever been at 265 lbs, I don't even know what body fat % that is, but I'm sure it's well over half, which is disgusting. Hit the gym this week for the first time in forever and felt embarrassed at how difficult and heavy everything felt. Trying to stay on a keto diet has been sabotaged by late night eating and fast food. Porn has been invading back into my life in a serious way, especially with the wife out of the house on a trip with the kids. These last two days, I've been okay with no issues...mostly because of guilt and feeling depressed from it. STATS: 265 lbs, over 40% BF, 5'10"", 1RM for SQ (185 lb...I have back issues), BP (200 lb), DL (250 lb)

Fashion? Now that's an aspect I haven't thought of in a long while. Most of my shirts accentuate my man-boobs, so I wear black or baggy. I just saw some pictures of me from a family bbq and I look like Jabba, bloated and oh so self-conscious. Lounging at home in gym shorts and flip flops describes me pretty well at the moment. I would love to get to the point where I feel confident to dress nicely, but when I do dress nicely for church, all I see are lovehandles and someone trying too hard to look semi-normal. A faker. I spend most of my free time on my phone, reading about how to get better or half mindedly skimming posts, getting distracted by the next program that I can buy to be the best version of myself. Except, I keep getting worse. I'm not sure what kino is, but that's why I'm here, to learn and grow...I am suddenly aware that this subreddit post might be my ""next program"". I hope that it's not just a flash in the pan, but an actual starting point with measurable progress. 

Income is okay (I make about $90k/year), but management of it is all in my wife's hands. That's my fault and undoing. I spoke with her about it last week, wanting to start meeting once a week with the intention of reviewing the budget, where we can save, and where we are frivolous. I'm horrible with my impulsive spending and so is she. We don't have a budget plan really at all. I make the money (well, she works about 15 hours a week...) and she pays the bills  with it. I can see the primary fault line tracking back to me not leading her, playing into a bit of a martyr role with myself. I am beginning to understand myself as someone who will use my earning as a right to spend impulsively. My impulsive purchases are things like protein powders, workout programs or equipment, video games, FOOD and MORE FOOD, and books.

Our sex life (ha, ""life"") is...not even on life support, it feels like I'm at the memorial service going on 4 years without. I know the exact date, sadly. 

MENTAL/EMOTIONAL:

I feel...""blah"". Like my life is an uphill grind in ice skates, but I know a lot of the answer to that is right here, owning it. I'm currently reading Bigger, Leaner, Stronger by Michael Matthews, which is very motivating and checking all the boxes for me in understanding why working out is important to all of life, along with his book ""The Little Black Book of Workout Motivation"". 

I feel stuck in a rut, and my job has a lot to do with that, which I'll touch on later. I'm excited to learn about these concepts of frame, Agree &amp; Amplify, etc. I've bought the book ""No More Christian Nice Guy"" and ""The Biblical Masculinity Blueprint"" to master these concepts in my life. 

My willpower is the big struggle right now, always seeking comfort and avoiding hardship. To that, I avoid conflict with my wife, sometimes altogether, or I just bite my tongue when we are arguing, giving up on changing her perspective. My wife isn't a Christian, and if anything, is an anti-Christian who balks and scoffs at my beliefs, which make it desperately harder to teach our kids the gospel. I am ashamed to confess that I have been so utterly a failure in teaching them. There are times where I will muster my resolve and head into their bedroom (yes, my wife sleeps with them and I sleep in a separate room, and yes, I know that's the root of many issues...or perhaps, the fruit of them...), and announce that we will do a bible study tonight. It's met with groans and a ""seriously??"" from the wife. Furthermore, now my daughter is following her lead. Just typing this gives me so much grief and sadness...

I'm insanely lonely, much of which stems from working an evening shift. I feel that also leads to my wife feeling like a single parent, and when I step up or in to the parenting role when I get home, or on the weekends, it feels like I'm the intruder, that I'm taking the wheel from her. To be sure, I don't have a problem with that per se, but I do feel like making a move to a day shift will perhaps resolve these issues. I can't make a difference if I'm not present.

There is a constant struggle as to whether or not I should stay in my marriage, or if it is for my, my wife's, and my children's good. I don't want to be lightly taken when I feel that her anxiety and anger, her resentment and verbal thrashings, stem from much of what I've neglected to tend and keep, neglected to weed, till, and sow. I am reaping much of what I have neglected to plant. That's what haunts me, that while her methods of yelling and complaining are wrong, the core of the matters she is angry make me think that maybe she wouldn't be frustrated if I didn't give her so much to be frustrated about.

SPIRITUAL: 

Assurance of Salvation: 6/10 - I feel like my walk is a slow, baby like crawl, and I am distracted by all manner of things. I take assurance in knowing that it is not my works that save me, but His works...but I do not feel like I am responding in the way a Christian should, to the lavishing grace that He gives me. I feel unworthy, and I prove it every day. I find myself thinking, ""well, if I truly believe in Christ, in God, in His Spirit, if I am truly His own child, why do I keep acting like a prodigal, fleeing to lusts and passions of the flesh? Why do I keep being lazy about reading His word, praying, or communing with Him?"" Doubts arise about whether I am like  a tree, planted by living streams and bearing fruit in its season, or if I am like a seed on dry ground, or growing to be choked out by the distractions of this world.

Quiet Time/Devotional: 1/10 - I'm inconsistent at BEST. Some mornings will start with a quick utterance of a prayer, sometimes I'll read Charles Spurgeon's Morning &amp; Evening. At my best, I was doing the Anglican Book of Prayer each day for a couple months back in January. This required getting up before the kids, and going for a sunrise walk. I need to get back to this!

Bible Study: 0/10 - I've never read through the entire Bible. I will pull up a verse of the day and seem intent to memorize it, until a week goes by and I haven't looked back at it. My Bible stays in the passenger seat or the bedside table. Should I just read it from start to finish? Is there a recommended reading plan? I'm just going to start at the beginning tonight...

Scripture Memory 1/10 - Oh! This is a good category, I love memorizing the thoughts of our Lord. I'm currently trying to memorize Philippians...but I've been saying that for about 10 years now. Man, that hurts to type! I have the first chapter down, but I'm going to start renewed and anew. It used to be such a blessing to constantly be shaping and building scripture passages in my mind. When I was in full swing of this (again, ten years ago), I felt a sense of marveling and even honor at holding God's words in my mind, letting my mouth speak them until they sank into my heart and soul. 

Prayer 1/10 - See above, my disciplined prayer time is non-existent. I will pause to pray, sometimes before work or a meal, but that isn't what this is about. Communing with God and being still in prayer and meditation on Him is vacant, and thus, my spiritual life is void. I will pray in the mornings after reading Spurgeon's Morning devotional, in the afternoons with my Anglican Book of Common Prayer, and again in the Evening. Specifically for my wife and kids, and my sanctification in marriage and leading them.",1625097680

But I think it's always good to have a bit of an open relationship. I think my partner and I had been sharing everything with each other. You know, when you're in a relationship with someone you have to be open with each other, otherwise it can get weird. 

I don't think that you should share everything, not even if you're in a serious relationship. But if you're in a relationship but you don't feel like you need to be open with each other, you can go ahead and share everything you can with your partner. 

I think it's not bad to share everything with your partner, especially if it's your first time with someone. I think it's important to be open with each other.

But I think it's also not a bad thing to share with someone you're not in a relationship with. I think it's better to be open with your partner because he might also be scared in case he's not ready to be open with you.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Firstly, blocking him and never speaking to him again is, in my opinion, your best option. He is displaying behavior similar to a sociopath and you do not want someone like that in your life, trust me. They say and do all the right things, but they dont mean it, they say it only to get something they want, and it seems like he was saying nice things to you when some other girl wasn't talking to him, and being mean to you when he was talking to another girl. That's my best guess anyway.

I know it hurts right now, but trust me, the pain of removing someone like this from your life is far less than the amount of pain he will continue to put you through toying with your emotions, being hot and cold. That is not ok. Please find someone who is kind to you, you deserve it. Anything less than a kind person is not a person you want to be romantically involved with. 

You are sad now, and that's ok. Get all those feelings put now so that once you've healed from this, you can get back into the dating game stronger and more self confident. Do not settle for anything less than a person who treats you as well as you treat them. 

I know it suck right now, but i promise, things will get better and you will feel better with a little time. Be good to yourself and remind yourself you are worth the world and to be treated with respect. Take care :) all will be well",1625097681

"spirituality","t5_2qhc5","There is the widespread meaning and the precise meaning.

The widespread meaning refers to something that is easy for everybody to imagine - ""abandoning the old self/ego in favor of the new self"", which sounds like a sort of reinvention of oneself.

The precise meaning is just literally that - getting used to the very same phases one encounters on the passage to the afterlife while being alive, with one of the key outtakes being the feat of breaching through the fear of death and all the darkness related to it (which means facing that which your ego fears the most).

For while you can breach through this and still exist, your ego is not capable of doing so. Hidden behind this darkness is the light of your true nature (hence ""en-light-enment"", yet another word of two meanings).

A man lives life but does not *know* life due to not knowing its opposite. Just like a fish swims in the water but does not *know* the water due to not knowing its opposite.

And so the fish may theorize about ""becoming a new kind of fish"" until the day a fisherman comes and drags it out of the water, never to be seen again. This doesn't really increase the amount of fish that *know* water.

But sometimes, a fish jumps out of the water, spends few precious moments in the air, only to dive into the water once again. Now, this fish *knows* the water, because it had a chance to *know* its opposite (the air) as well, it experienced the contrast, something very clear and illustrative. You may even say the fish had to develop a new sense not present before - a sense of air.

Therefore, this particular fish ""died before it died"" and obtained direct experiential knowledge, something it may tell the others about - and yet the rest of the fish will only be able to derive theoretical knowledge out of that - after all, hearing about air does not equal *knowing* the air from own experience.",1625097681

Keep in mind that even though a lot of unique features of SC's planets are placed manually around areas of interest, the rest is still procedural and doesn't mean such features can't be placed algorithmically to similar effect. 

Define tectonic regions and their movement direction, volcanic pressure regions and the mountain trails they create based on that movement, erosion lines stemming from all the saddle points, erosion lines converging to larger ones, eventually into canyons, riverbeds, and dunes. Frontier reworked planets without considering any of that. What was the point? It appears they are just randomly spraying patterns everywhere and anywhere.",1625097681

Regarding your comment about loving another child, my wife was more worried about this. I was slightly concerned but not overly so. Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think this one is as valid. You can love both of your children equally and with all of your heart.

Some other things to note: 

Two kids is more than twice the work

It‚Äôs ok to have an only child

If you have a second, have them close in age. Mine are close and I could not imagine going back to diapers, bottles and strollers after moving them on.

You can have two children without having five children. Just because you have another doesn‚Äôt mean you open the door to your original plan of 3-5 kids. There‚Äôs no magic number, just what you can handle and feels right for your family.

When you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre done, make it permanent. Vasectomy or tubal. Don‚Äôt put yourself in a position to have to make a hard choice. Or find yourself questioning your decisions as your hormones take over the rational part of your brain.",1625097682

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Bruh the reason the prosecutor made that promise was to force Cosby to testify at the civil trial do that Cosby would lose the civil trial. He literally didn't want Cosby to get away with anything. He just didn't think there was enough evidence to convict Cosby criminally, and he knew that Cosby would win the civil case too unless he had to testify. If there was the threat of a criminal trial Cosby could invoke the 5th amendment and not testify at the civil trial. By making this promise, the prosecutor removed that possibility which forced Cosby to testify in the civil trial and his testimony caused him to lose the civil trial.

Cosby's 2018 conviction only occurred because of his testimony from the civil trial. He would not have been convicted without it. This testimony only occurred because of the promise the DA made. Without this promise Cosby still walks free because he pleads the 5th at the civil trial.

People are acting like Cosby would be in jail if the DA hadn't made that promise, but no, the reality is that if the DA hadn't made that promise, Cosby would not have been convicted in 2018 and he would also very likely have won the civil case. So what the DA did was actually helpful, as it at least made Cosby lose the civil case, while Cosby would have walked free either way.",1625097682

Flash heal is expensive and most priests don't want to cast it. Take a look at how much damage your dps is taking ask if it is simply too much for a healer to keep up with. I had a tank bitch to me about how I go oom too quickly witb 2 warlocks in H mechanar lifetappjng to death at the beginning of every pull. And it never occurred to the tank to take a look at how much stress the DPS is putting on the healer. Frankly its not worth it to play this game as heals. You have to deal with bitchy tanks and inept DPS who feign death or vanish after pulling off the tank, then they dare complain about healer threat. Healer threat wouldn't exist if we didn't have to heal so much within 5 fucking seconds into a pull. Not to mention warlocks rarely cast soul stones without being told to do so.

"Fighters","t5_2s5rz","SF and Smash are 2 games I really wanted to get into because I loved watching them but absolutely ended up not clicking with despite repeated attempts. 

With SF, I'm just really bad at the amount of memorization and studying you need to know your matchups, possible combos and links, including from counter hits or against the wall, what's plus and what's minus, genuine options vs bad ones etc. It requires a lot of focus and upkeep mentally to keep up with, and I think I tend to end up just over thinking it as I grind. I prefer something more free form and easy to learn hard to master i guess.

With Smash, I really ended up disliking the floaty feel and what felt to me like fiddly attacks. I used to play a smash clone Digimon Rumble Arena 2 as a kid that I quite enjoyed, but it has much more of a grounded feel and the attacks are less quick.

Resting some players maybe? Will Jordan is mega lucky to get a start.

Regardless, we are lucky to have all black test matches of which I'm extremely grateful for. Hopefully get to see my man Ethan B grab control of this 6 jersey once and for all and keep it right through to the world cup.",1625097683

"madisonwi","t5_2r8rz","Perhaps not super surprising, the sheer hours of labor it takes to mail out tens of thousands of absentees. 

This is by no means a complaint. Purely recognizing the incredible, dedicated Election Officials (EOs) who worked tirelessly by hand to: collate instructional inserts, tear off individual ""I voted"" stickers, place labels on the outgoing and incoming absentee envelopes, sorting and organizing thousands of labeled envelopes by ward number, picking the correct ballot, checking and double checking the ward and corresponding ballot style; stamping, initialing, and folding the ballot into the envelopes; checking, double, and triple checking the envelope has a ballot before taking it all to the mail room for processing. 

On their return, each absentee envelope is scanned by hand into the state's database; checked and double checked for the voter and witness signatures and witness's address, sorted into the appropriate ward, and checked multiple times for the correct ward before sealing each ward's box. This labor, multiplied by the thousands, is only accomplished with the cavalry of hardworking EOs. Appreciate the grace of the public recognizing mistakes like an absentee envelope missing its instructions is because we are all humans, not machines. 

Same goes for all the IPAV sites and polling places on Election Day. There are only 10 full time staff, 3 rotated schedulers/payroll, and 2 regular hourlies. We could not do any of this election work without the entire Clerk's Office team and the thousands of Election Officials. We all do this as civil servants dedicated to making democracy accessible its people. - Bonnie",1625097683

"HomeNetworking","t5_2s4pd","You may want to read on how networking works, especially the division of labor between L2 and L3.

The basic idea is that on the local network, the L2 protocol (eg Ethernet) is used to transfer packets and figure out who gets what. L2 protocol use preassigned unique MAC addresses and L2 packets use MAC addresses to indicate the destination of a packet.

IP addresses (an L3 concept for the IP and other protocols) are used to communicate over series of networks. IP addresses are allocated through a variety of methods including static assignment by local software or dynamic assignment through DHCP by a server.

The ARP protocol is used to bridge the addressing between IP addresses (what most software uses) and MAC addresses (which the network adapter uses).

On the common case, when you are trying to connect to an IP address your PC has never seen, but which is within your network, it will broadcast an ARP request to the whole network for somebody to tell it what the corresponding MAC address for that IP address is. Then it puts that MAC address in its ARP table and will use this from now on to send packets to that IP address.

By adding a static ARP entry on your PC, your not at all allocating a temporary address to the printer. Instead, you are forcing the PC to send all packets of that given IP destination address to the printer. Then, naturally, the printer will pick up the packets since they correspond to its MAC address. 

That's not the end though. Most IP stack will reject the packets when they see that the IP address does not correspond. 

The ""ping"" portion of the sequence is because some devices indeed support a way to be given a temporary IP address (ie accept packets for that IP addresses as its own) by being sent said IP address through an abnormally long ping (ICMP) packet. That finishes the sequence.",1625097684

"arduino","t5_2qknj","I'm working on a 3D printed mechanical 7-segment Clock using 3d printed parts. It's designed so that one stepper motor can control one digit. With one stepper motor i'm able to make 10 different numbers. The final clock will consist of 4 digits total. The parts were printed in PLA on the Ender 3. The model was designed in Fusion 360. This was one of my first projects in fusion 360, making projects like this has helped me a lot with getting familiar with using fusion 360. I first started working on this project around the same time last year.  
  
To control the digits i‚Äôm using 4 nema 17 stepper motors, one for each digit. They are mounted on the top. The stepper motors are controller by a4988 stepper drivers, these are controller by an arduino uno.  
  
This project is still a work in progress. You might have noticed that i‚Äôm (still) using rubber bands and toothpicksüòú  
  
For demonstration purposes i‚Äôm displaying numbers by sending them to the arduino using the Serial monitor (you can hear me typing the digits in the background). Normally it would be displaying the time, which i‚Äôm keeping track of using a DS3231 RTC module.  
  
I have more videos, including 2 different video‚Äôs about this project, up on the channel!üëÄ

I don't expect great volume in the near term. This being on the radars of many retail traders and gaining acceptance on wallstreet, volume will increase significantly with any catalyst - a good 8k-worthy release.

I am looking forward to both the quarter result in August and the forward guidance.

Yes the share price has dipped a little, but I'm more relaxed without the overabundance of Memesters panic buying and selling. It stressed me out, ya know,  ContextLogics is a good company, great future, no debt. Let's chill and grow.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Gritty Realism solves a problem of ""it's too tedious to drain resources in a single day"" by stretching it out to a week, but introduces the problem of ""all these features we have for resting are now useless, the dungeon-running economy no longer makes sense, and we are mysteriously always on a clock now in a way that shuts down a sandbox game"".

We've all identified the problem in the default resting system, more or less: parties have too many resources to have a meaningful encounter with ""the boss"" if they're full-up, so they need to be worn down in some way. And it's boring going through those ""wear down the party"" encounters that you know will be won, sucking up an hour or more from sessions when gathering time for tables is already at a premium, just to get the game in a state of good balance for interesting combat.

If characters have too many resources... let's just start them pre-drained. We don't need to run four encounters to make the fifth one interesting if we can run two encounters from a starting point of ""this is about how out of it you'd be after three things we skipped"". This can be accomplished a whole host of ways, and the incongruencies it introduces can be solved through abstractions and justifications that are less injurious to the verisimilitude of the setting, game balance, and timing than ""you need a week (in town?) or something"".

Alternatively, if we've acknowledged that ""the adventuring day"" is often too short to be meaningful and it would be useful if we could extend that over a week or so, let's just do that. The original one-size-fits-all-sessions approach wasn't work, so why are we any more sure that this *new* one-size-fits-all-sessions approach of ""you need a week (in town?) or something"" will? Let's just vary it based on what the DM has planned. Is the party going from town to nearby necromancer cave and intended to finish said cave before returning? Then that's the adventure. That might take one session, might take two, but we've decided to balance ""the adventure"" around getting there, getting through there, and maybe getting back. So we're just going to declare that's the period of adventure that is bookended by long rests. And we do that for every batch of encounters we have, tailoring the concept of when long rests are available to the game instead of tailoring the game to the concept of long rests.

A month later, we might be having the party trek across continent to another dungeon. Do we intend for *just the dungeon* to be the adventure? Then we skip the travel entirely. There's either not a Ranger in the party or there is, so whatever; if the party's not interested in fighting ettercaps and dire wolves or whatever in the forest, we skip it. Do we intend for the travel *and the dungeon* to be the adventure? Then like the example above, long rests bookend it. Maybe we want to run the whole travel thing--we need time to prep the dungeon next week!--and also intend the dungeon to be tough. Well, then we do the travel and say no full restoration of features until they hit the dungeon or decide to break off, then we do the dungeon and say no full restoration of features until they're done with it or decide to break off. Maybe I need even more time for prep--now the travel is two sessions long, and maybe the party gets a long rest in the middle of it because I came up with all these ideas about an evil goat herd and ice spiders and wyverns and some ice elementals! We can even decide to do the travel *and* the dungeon with a single long rest in between--where and when is up to the party, as long as the DM makes them aware of this in advance:

&gt;I intend for you to go through the wilderness, deal with all those encounters, and then deal with the whole dungeon with only one long rest available. You can take that mid-travel if you want. You can take it at the entrance to the dungeon. You can do all the travel, poke into the dungeon, go as far as you dare, then retreat and long rest and come back to do the remainder. You can basically tailor your difficulty here depending on how much you want to stretch your resources and when you long rest.

In all scenarios, the balance of the game is preserved. To be open and clear about resource-restoring opportunities should be no more damaging to the game's fiction than ever mentioning things like ""hit die"" or ""spell level"" or ""proficiency times per day"", all spoken of OOC without issue. Now, if we want to introduce time problems on a case-by-case basis to stress the party, we can do that because it's our intention and fits the narrative we're going for--not because we've needed to ensure all the narrative works with the idea of making an extraneous week-long rest undesirable in most cases.",1625097686

Memberships simply aren't that good of a deal other than in this particular case, apparently you get a free $25 off $100, so maybe its good for one purchase and then you don't use it anymore lol. Rightstuf's constant \~30% off *any manga* (25%, but they don't charge tax), and other huge retailers like Amazon frequently having them on sale for 10-25% excluding a special B2G1 etc., just makes these stagnant ""10% off future purchases"" not worth it. Maybe you'll get an additional 10$ off $100 coupon once a month or something, but then it's just baiting you to purchase a ton at once to get another minor discount overall

Second notice that the stalker attempts to turn the tables by projecting the stalker's own action of harassment. 

Third notice that the stalker demands the other stop replying to their own inbox. All after the stalker literally just spammed two messages to my one. Yup. 

Too easy to see through. 




And it's all so easy to cut through with : **The stalker is literally the one seeking confrontation by stalking and harassing.**

All the details: **Yup.

"cpp_questions","t5_2tdbd","&gt; I was wondering if there was a way where I could just add a `CComboBox` to a `CDialog`.

That's definitely a thing you can do.  If your application doesn't need to display a document, starting with something based around a dialog box instead of a window makes several things much simpler: you get to use the dialog manager to handle all the event-loop stuff, for instance.

&gt; If I use the Windows C API can I keep main() or do I have to switch to WinMain()?

You'll have to switch to `WinMain`.  I""m not entirely sure a user-supplied `main` is supportable under MFC, anyway.

It may be that the right approach is to have your frontend UI a separate program from what does the actual work, where the UI widgets are the user's input into crafting a command-line (or startup script or whatever your program use), and the UI watches the [process handle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-handles-and-identifiers) resulting from spawning the worker (or workers, if you get fancy).",1625097692

&gt;I do want to know what it's like to have sex with someone, but I also want to know about my wife. It's hard for me to tell her in this case, but we've talked about it before, and she gets a little nervous and uncomfortable. 

That's good, it's a good sign.  I really want to know how my wife feels about it.  I think she's the right one for me, and I really want to know how she feels about it.  Maybe she's embarrassed about it too?

I wouldn't bother, though, as if they follow the pattern established so far then everything in Psychic Awakening will all be invalidated by the new codex when it comes. Likely most of the rules from PA will just be incorporated into the new codex in some form, and any that aren't will just be gone.

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","It has become more acceptable (and profitable) to call out racism, but part of why racism comes up everywhere is because people put their racism everywhere, especially in the US. Most things have some racist history in the US, whether it's the arts, sciences, politics, medicine, housing, sports, immigration, marriage etc. It was just largely taboo to talk about or question the racism in most areas. 





The racist legacy of many of these things has been dismantled over the years with legislation and changing public attitudes, with interracial marriage and integrated schools being less of an issue now than in the past. But that does not mean that all of these things are fixed or that there aren't lingering issues to be addressed, so it is important to be aware of how racism has affected most things in the US and that we should remain vigilant to prevent retreating to old habits whether out of laziness, neglect, or malice.",1625097693

What kind of bullshit is that, you do know that 10 years in prison will change a person right, or are you one of the people who believe that once you commit crimes you can never change for the better?

People change

Besides he's 83 years old and he's Bill Cosby, do you think anyone would just accept a drink from him

I mean I have faith and believe he's changed for the better, but I wouldn't accept a drink that I didn't see pored from him

I am In no way saying what he did was remotely right in any way, but what I am saying is that he served his sentence of let me remind you 10 YEARS, like I dont see how anyone thinks he's the same

I think (we'll know) that 10 years in prison will change a person, let's be optimistic and hope its for the better

Plus, again Bill Cosby had no power, if he does start his crimes again, a victim can easily call up the police and he'd be arrested again, drugging and rape is on Bill Cosbys criminal record, it's way easier to get him in jail now than it was 10 YEARS ago",1625097693

You don't always have that right in a civil trial, but you *definitely* do when you could incriminate yourself in a way that would serve as evidence in a criminal trial. So, in order to compel him to confess in a civil trial, the DA told him he would never be charged. That's essentially immunity from prosecution which wipes out your 5th amendment rights. 

Then, the next guy said that this wasn't an immunity deal and charged Cosby and then used the testimony which he gave under the impression that he didn't have the fifth amendment in court. 

The question isn't if he's a rapist, he is, but that's not important at all here. The *only* question here is whether or not the original DA had granted Cosby immunity. That's it. 

The original DA did what he did, knowing that it would be seen as immunity, in order to give the victims the right to some justice in the form of a pile of Cosby's money. 

The victims got lucky here that the trial judge didn't see the original press conference as an offer of immunity, and that they got his money *and* got to see him spend a couple years in prison.",1625097694

Clinically, I do believe that the evidence tends to point to them not being **consciously** manipulative, and I think that‚Äôs why many throw pity party‚Äôs for them.  But I‚Äôve come to realize that it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are aware of what or why they‚Äôre doing something, the results speak for themselves.  The behaviors are manipulative whether the pwBPD understands that or not, and their lack of awareness around their auto-pilot movements is not cute. 

It‚Äôs all sorts of fucked up. To bystanders, their abuse doesn‚Äôt seem to matter or it goes undetected because it‚Äôs easy to invoke sympathy for yourself when you‚Äôre crying and begging for someone to please love you.  Nevermind the fact that the crying act was preceded by the pwBPD following their partner around accusing him of cheating and proceeding to damage his property - that doesn‚Äôt matter.  What matters is that the pwBPD is hurting. Fuck everyone else. 

The trail of damage they leave in their wake is staggering. Lives ruined.  People living with very real trauma, that they‚Äôll have to battle for potentially the rest of their lives. But these people are just loose, onto the next guy. 0 accountability.  

I‚Äôm rambling, I just struggle with all of this. In order to heal, PwBPD do need validation for the trauma they themselves went through, but that needs to happen behind the closed doors of a therapist‚Äôs office, **not** by jumping from man to man trying to feel something demanding everyone have pity for them because they‚Äôre the real victims; while we watch man after man drop dead in their path. üôÑ",1625097694

Meaning I'd have to take the dog out on a leash every time she needs to go. And she's got a squirrel bladder so I'd be dropping what I'm doing like 9 times a day on my days off to put her on a leash and take her out so she could go. 

She would also inevitably get all amped up every single time, thinking she's going for a walk. So she'd be a menace every time it was just for a potty break. 

This alone might be the key that influences my decision.",1625097694

He only admitted it because he had a guarantee that he would not be prosecuted. 

A new DA then came in and prosecuted Cosby in a new criminal trial using the evidence and confession from the civil trial as a cornerstone of their prosecution. That‚Äôs a huge issue, and they honestly never should have been allowed to use any of that in trial. That‚Äôs why the PA Supreme Court threw the case out.

"Cloud9","t5_2udw5","The fans don't need transparency in the same way orgs don't need fans.  Fans aren't entitled to transparency, and it isn't immoral or anything to be completely nontransparent.  At the same time, fans don't owe their loyalty or fandom to any organization.  I think C9 will justifiably lose some fans over this, and I don't think all of them will be bandwagon fans either.  I think it's in C9's best interest to release some statement on this.

Esports are in a unique spot compared to traditional sports, since there's no real reason to be loyal.  Traditional sports have the benefit of geographic loyalty - even if a team is bad, their hometown will generally root for them. I, and many others, became huge fans of C9 when it was the original 5.  When Sneaky eventually left, it was in no way the team I had started to root for, largely because of the personality of the players themselves.  I stuck with the team because I liked Jack's attitudes, priorities, and the team culture.  With moves like benching Zven, it makes me question the team management's decision and my loyalty.  

There may very well have been a good and justifiable reason to bench Zven.  It's more likely than not.  But with no official communication on it, it leaves us wondering.  And to be very clear, there are ways to be transparent without divulging internal drama or violating anyone's privacy.  There are people who's entire career is PR and messaging things appropriately.  A simple ""There were interpersonal issues in the team following MSI and we decided time apart was necessary"" would absolutely be sufficient, would stop rumors, and would justify their actions to an increasingly antsy fanbase.

And sure, you can say to current C9 fans - ""If you don't like it, just don't be a fan.""  But, most fans _want_ to be fans.  We want the org we like to do better and we don't want to abandon them.  That's the same sentiment as, ""If you don't like your country, instead of trying to improve it, just leave.""",1625097695

"ERB","t5_2th4w","* Once again, I understand the disappointment of Banner vs. Jenner, what with Caitlyn's second verse being admittedly pretty mediocre, with only her final line being a stand out line for me with the rest of the verse just being filler that could've been used for the Hulk. I still rate it higher than something like Batman vs. Holmes because they at least nailed the look and mannerisms of Banner/Hulk. And even with fewer lines, Hulk was still entertaining and won purely on his line about Kylie Jenner. And again, the first half of this battle, while nothing special, isn't terrible, which, combined with the Hulk's lines and the legitimately fantastic beat, is what keeps the battle from dropping any lower.
* I count the entire trilogy as one entity because they work so well with each other and are ranked as high as they are purely for what they represent. I go more in depth on the significance of each part in a different comment, just look somewhere on here for that comment and my reason for their placement is there.
* Freddy Krueger vs. Wolverine is visually stunning, for sure one of their best visually. ~~Where I feel it falters is in its writing, mostly on Freddy's side. It's nice to see Wax return for a battle after his appearance in Spielberg vs. Hitchcock, but his lines don't wow me here. The only line from Freddy I thought was entertaining was the one where he jabs Wolverine for being in comics kids get on Christmas. Everything else he says doesn't do anything for me. Wolverine had a very nice flow, but his lines, with the exception of his first, didn't shock me too much. And this may be an unpopular opinion, but the Jason line from Wolverine was just okay. I've seen a lot of people in the comments of the battle say that it was the winning line, but I don't see it. I think they still could've brought up Jason, but bring up how Jason kicked Freddy's ass in~~ *~~Freddy vs. Jason.~~* ~~That would've made for a better line, in my humble opinion. Kind of what Freshly Kanal did in his battle, Freddy Krueger vs. Pennywise, which to me is a better representation of Krueger's character. Overall, this battle has some good parts to it, mostly in the visuals and cinematography, but I feel like a large portion of it, in terms of the writing, is mostly just okay.~~ (Disregard this paragraph; I'm retroactively moving this battle into the bottom of A. See my reply to volcanorosso for my realization.
* The Joker vs. Pennywise, on the other hand, is on a whole other league compared to Freddy/Wolverine. Almost every single line has a double/triple meaning, with far more shocking lines than Freddy/Wolverine, the costumes and acting, while good in Krueger vs. Wolverine, are even more incredible here (Seriously, first time I watched this battle, I didn't even recognize Lloyd as Pennywise, that's how amazing it is.), the visuals and CGI look like they were ripped straight out of the It movies, and it all comes together for me. There's a reason why this is the most popular of the newer battles in the series, and it really feels like a passion project for the team. ~~There may be something about Freddy vs. Wolverine that I am just missing, but I feel that it doesn't hold a candle to Joker vs. Pennywise.~~
* Tesla vs. Edison is in B Tier, next to Ash Ketchum vs. Charles Darwin, near the bottom. A good battle and portrayal of both characters. Good visuals and clever writing, especially for Tesla.",1625097696

&amp;#x200B;

Also their green cards are all move forward type of moves except zenkai blue gogeta who 7/10 is not gonna be used on an optimal FW team. So unless you are ssj4 gogeta you can't follow up on your green card unless the opponent has no cover change unit.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I think I see what you mean. For me, personally, I just feel that if you wear skin tight clothes in public you will attract comparatively more unwanted attention than if you didn't. The wife in the OP's post is understandably upset about a problem in society as a whole but she's taking it out on the wrong person, accusing OP of misogyny, and everyone else in this thread seems to also be jumping on that bandwagon without giving him benefit of the doubt. That's why I was frustrated with this thread. 

You are absolutely correct that men and women's bodies have different meanings in society, and perhaps I wasn't considering that as much when I wrote my post. However, I do think it is absolutely, 100% true that if the wife didn't wear compression leggings in public that showed her whole ass, she would get significantly less unwanted attention. Sure, she would still get it- since she's a woman in public and that's just what happens to us.  The husband in this story is not in the wrong by pointing out the very fact that if her ass wasn't visible, people would be less inclined to stare at it. I don't really understand the YTA ruling when he's not necessarily wrong here.

I guess in a perfect world, no one would view any differences in male/female/nb/etc bodies. The human body can just be a body and gender differences can be completely overlooked. And we could just exist without automatically assuming we're sexually on display for wearing revealing or skin tight clothing. But, we don't live in that world.    


As for comparing this thread to the compression shorts situation, I understand your point. Maybe I'm just inherently unwilling to view a dude's butt and junk as any different contextually from a woman's butt and junk, and I guess I need to take my own advice and understand I don't live in that perfect world.

PH sounds like it's similar to Goons in the breadth of ships that get covered, but it's also the only one that uses IOUs/alternate currencies as a replacement for isk, and I've been reading a bunch of news articles today about the troubles with Tether's commercial paper backing and the collapse of SafeDollar, and it struck me as really similar.

This bootlegger contains demos/live versions of songs from the album Fishing for Fishies. 


For those of you unaware, King Gizz is a pretty prolific australian psych rock band known for their eclectic album genres and intense release cycles. They are set to release a third and potentially fourth album this year which would mean set them up to have 20 within the last decade. There is even rumors of them going past 4 and trying to beat their current record, set in 2017, of 5 in one year. Each of these albums are honestly fantastic and the band keeps coming up with new genres to take on seemingly randomly. From garage rock, to folk rock, to jazz, to metal, to psychedelic rock, to fucking spaghetti western this band really has it all. 

If you are looking to get into the band I'd defo start with something like Polygondwanaland or I'm In Your Mind Fuzz. If you like something a little more soft and relaxed I'd recommend my personal favorite album Paper Mache Dream Balloon.",1625097699

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","Some of this (looming over you to check your rolls, not telling you about a major worldbuilding aspect affecting your character until the game had started, potentially getting the balance of challenge in encounters wrong) sounds like bad DMing.

Some of it sounds like an emotionally immature response from you (crying about a character death is fine and normal, but taking it out on your DM is not reasonable or fair), or choices which in hindsight were always bound to end in sadness (basing NPCs on people you've loved and lost irl).

Some of it sounds like reasonable and good game design, or at worst a good game that's just wrong for your preferences (serious consequences for in game actions, a world with a largely hostile and unfriendly outlook, death being largely permanent, complex moral choices like a life for a life).

The main thing standing out to me here though is that he a) is acting jealously regarding your ""attraction"" to an imaginary character, which is honestly just childish, and b) is (for a trivial reason, no less) knowingly ignoring you and continuing to do something which you've told him is a trigger for your anxiety - I won't mince words on this, that is emotionally abusive behaviour.

When I said it replaces mortgage interest, I meant it replaces what would‚Äôve been paid as interest if the loan had been for the land. Real estate loans are based on the value of buildings, other improvements but also the land. 

If taxes were instead shifted to land value, the price of land would fall to a tiny amount. Almost all of the gains from land speculation would vanish. Mortgage loans would instead be collateralized by the value of buildings and of income from tenants. 

Existing loans is a troubling thing but I think if the transition is gradual, bankers and homeowners would adapt to the changing conditions without too much turmoil. I think a slow transition, compensating normal homeowners who lose out during the transition, and letting bankers lose out on the interest payments due to land prices falling over time is good enough. I don‚Äôt think we need to also task the government with determining the bankers calculated composition of interest charges. Ultimately with any policy change, someone somewhere will lose, but overall the gains from a LVT shift far outweigh the losses to bankers and the select group of owner-occupier homeowners.",1625097699

This cannot be repeated often enough. Except if it has been too long and they don't care about you anymore, PEOPLE, IF YOU DID SOME CRAP WHILE SPLITTING, APOLOGIZE (sincerely. Not just empty words. These are bad as well) AND TRY TO MAKE AMMENDS. Don't just think ""well, it'll work better next time"" and jump on your next FP. Also, apologize TO THE PERSON, not just in your head. This part is quite important. If the person doesn't talk to you anymore, send a quick mail. Not a needy one where you do this to ""patch things up"", one where the CORE of the idea is you apologizing even if they insult you as a result. Be prepared for it. The important part is the fact that your apologies must have a ""real"" existence in the ""real"" world. Not something that immediately disappears the next time you're splitting. 

Which is also why I put an emphasis on REAL apologies. Otherwise you'll just be known as ""this person that apologize but never mean it"".

It may sound stupid but the best way I can think about to illustrate it right now would be that, while you're in the process of recovering and improving, all of these littles ""apologies"" become hundreds of little chains that hold you back. It will not hold you back from getting angry; that's too much to ask for and not the point. But it will hold you back for long enough for you to be able to add this little ""I feel"" at the beginning of your next breakdown. The accountability, that is forced on you both by what you're going to say and by your apologies, will not eliminate the extreme feelings; but the goal isn't to ELIMINATE them, just to MITIGATE them. Just enough for you not to lose it entirely.


Needless to say, with this kind of problem, assuming a ""every day is a new day"" mindset is extremely unhealthy. You must not ignore the past and just hope that you'll be able to manage yourself the next time: you have to build on this past. No matter how shameful or guilt-inducing it was. No ""welp, I screwed up BUT I FEEL SO STRONGLY FOR THIS ONE, THIS TIME IT'S THE GOOD ONE!!"". You HAVE TO apologize, even to people you possibly now feel nothing about. It's part of the process. You basically need something that ""chains"" you to the ground. To avoid trying to fly again immediately, doing the same nonsense as usual, and repeating the same mistakes because, well, humans don't know how to fly, so you lost control. That's what accountability is for. And Accountability doesn't mean just apologizing once and if they forgive you, good, it means there is no problem. It means accepting this chain that will ""stay"" and ""hold you back"". And try despite it and despite the shame.   

The goal is to gain CONTROL over yourself. EVERY LITTLE TINY BIT OF CONTROL you can get even if it's in stupid ways. 

Thing is, BPD is ONE HELL of a self-fulfilling prophecy (which is also why I have problems with people saying things like ""you can't do anything about it""; yes I get what you mean but this statement is actually holding you back). Accepting that you have no control will only leave you with even less control in the end. Even if you really feel like you had no control over what you did. That's not the point. But rather than grounding that as a negative, it must beome a possibility of improvement. Little by little. And it's normal to have an hard time; there are also different levels of BPD ""trigger"". I personally still react quite violently to an actual abandonment, but I least I mostly got rid of the ""BPD delusions"" and am even able to joke about it. 

That's why in my case having to deal with responsibilities, that happened because of my own actions, ended up being so important. It gives you some ""grounding"" when your brain starts ""losing it"" to your emotion; the goal isn't to stop them, it's to make them manageable. Anything that can give you this ""grounding"" for an instant is good. Even if it's just like putting all your strength on a single climbing hold while you feel like you're flying above emptiness.

And to me, apologies and trying to make amend is one of the many, many parts of this. Even if inside of you you think you'll only bother the other person further. A part of this is leaning to act against your emotions when you're """"sane"""" enough to even if you wouldn't want to for one reason or another. 
I see it as building a ""structure"" of sort. Which is something you cannot do when you're too scared and have a ""I can't do anything about this"" or a ""better luck next time!"" mentality, since even if you THINK you'll take into account what you learned this time, you still go back from zero. After all, your emotional investment in the previous people, etc, disappeared, right? That's why you need these chains connecting you to all of these mistakes, even if you don't care about the people or the situation anymore. Awareness of how you acted, and reframing it in a positive way instead of a defeatist and self-pitying one WHILE aiming to improve, and that means not rejecting the past because it hurts and you're trying to get rid of it (again, you're not trying to GET RID OF IT, you're trying to BUILD on it. You can't say ""I'll do better next time"" if you're too broken to accept the previous time, or if you accept it in a negative way that'd worsen everything. Thing is, BPD DO tend to think they'll ""start a new life"" any time they have a new high. Just like cutting people off, this is quite an unhealthy habit, because while you can ""feel"" new, you're still carrying scars, habits, etc)  is the starting point.

You won't gain COMPLETE control of yourself when you lose it in one week, but the goal is to gain more control little by little even if you don't notice it.",1625097700

So many posts on that subreddit come from people who are RELIEVED to finally find a place where they are no longer laughed at or derogated for their beliefs, and so many report feeling alone in the ""real world"" because many of their friends and family wear masks or have gotten the vaccine. A lot of people from /r/NoNewNormal are auto-banned from other subreddits for following that subreddit, and it only strengthens their beliefs.

I'm a psychology researcher, and while there are around 20 years of research on misinformation, that field is still fairly new (compared to, say, the self-control research, which has been around for 50 years) , and there is even less research for misinformation spread specifically online. We don't know the best way to deal with misinformation spread online, and at this point, the best option is just to try a few different methods and see what works.",1625097700

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","&gt;There's no evidence racism ever ended, institutional or otherwise. Taking **laws** off the books does not mean the problem is solved - just as installing the 14th amendment (which said everyone was equal!) didn't solve the problem.

&gt;But what we can do is seriously assess the degree to which race is still baked into our **laws**, systems and processes continue to exacerbate racial divides, and how we can fix those problems.

So are there racist laws or not? From where I'm sitting I don't see any laws that are there to explicitly benefit the racial majority. I do however see racial laws which explicitly aim to benefit racial minorities. 

The system is somehow racist while having racial laws that clearly aim to benefit the marginalized race. It just doesn't make sense unless you focus on equity instead of equality.

This is why CRT is Neo-Marxist. It is not concerned with ending racism. You can't end racism. It is concerned with doing everything in their power to make US racially equitable. Which is also impossible. The reason why Critical Race Theorists are called Neo-Marxists is because they haven't learned from their predecessors which were traditional Marxists. Traditional Marxists only cared about class. Neo-Marxists extended it to gender, race and culture. 

You can call Marxists good people because they have honorable goals. But as history tells us, Marxism in practice is a very dangerous school of thought. The reason why a lot of Critical Race Theorists talk about white privilege, white silence, white supremacy is because it is a zero sum game. Just as it was for traditional Marxists. You're either against capitalism, or you're for capitalism. You're either against white supremacy, or you're with white supremacy. Marxists are revolutionaries. They believe in overthrowing systems instead of changing them. So they don't subscribe to your point of view.",1625097702

2) lol I opened the thread because my son is on briviact and it seems to be one of the lesser common drugs (maybe due to cost) But at 15, he currently isn't having sex (we do discuss it)   


So as feedback, my son definitely has none of this from physical exertion.  In fact i don't think he has been dizzy on briviact at all.  So maybe the influx of hormones during the act.  Would definitely make sense.    


When my son does become sexually active (hopefully in years not months eh) I'll ask him and I'll try and remember to come back here and respond again :D

"dauntless","t5_2vmcy","OP didn't ask about why they did it, rather would their build be affected by the changes in the next patch. I'll reply to this as well though~

Life doesn't have anything to do with shields. This also only goes for those who can do perfect runs, and you can't nerf everything based on those who have already aced the game, you don't cater to the highest or the absolute lowest, rather the average player with ways for the lowest to become average and the highest to be challenged. That's just game design in general though. 

As far as shields go, all shields have a condition and, aside from Fortress, have a short duration that requires constant attacking and dodging, so its not really ""constant"" unless you can keep it that way. Also you missed the part I said about every single one being capped at ~2400 when combined. Bastion itself gives about 500 shield total if you go 20 second without being hit or using its ability, which removes tap abilities all together. It also lowers the user's max health by 25%, so your max hp at base becomes 750. The actual buff becomes, at best on a perfect run, 14% damage buff at max hp with a 10% critical strike chance after 20 seconds, using +6 tenacious.
To get the amount I said for shields, you would need  the Bastion Omnicell, + 6 Fortress, Fast skarn weapon like chain blades, and skarn lantern to get the shields and that's with a perfect run and never letting off the behemoth or using tap, of course keeping in mind that bastion's shield bonus is already added to this math. Skarns lantern doesn't last long enough to be viable either.
With this in mind, cunning is actually as good, if not better than this entire combination at +6, not counting any other buffs.

Also on this note, if Tenacious really was the problem, you would just need to cap the amount you can get using Tenacious. Plus its confirmed, as of now, they are splitting Tenacious into two cells.

If shields were long lasting, didn't require a lot of upkeep/expire quickly, and behemoths couldn't literally go through thousands of shields in a single hit or stagger you till they go away, then capping would make more sense. That's not the case however, especially once the other changes in game occur in this same patch. Its also not ""common"" for shields, at current, to go above ~2-3k with a perfect run, using fast skarn weapons, except in very specific scenarios, with a perfect run.

I also believe you are confusing Bastion and Discipline omnicells as Bastion doesn't have stacks, rather Discipline does.

Again this is all information that can change by the next patch, but to the best of my knowledge there has been no mention of said changes and what they are yet, which is one reason we are hoping they listened to feedback as they said they would.",1625097703

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","There's usually some  things you got to think about when you're in a relationship.

For example,  are you in this relationship to get married or are you in this relationship just to be in a relationship and you don't care that you get married or not.  In other words , you're happy with things how they are now and you don't really care about the future of the relationship.  You're living in the now rather than thinking about the future.

In the case of long distance relationship , you have to think about how are you going to close the long distance. who will move to whom?  If it's a place like the European Union, then the movement can be done by either person because either one of you can easily change to live in different countries.

But if it's an example like two countries that don't have that kind of closeness like EU, then one of you has to be willing to move to the other person's country.  That person also has to be willing to and financially able to sponsor you to come to their country if you decide to get married.

So let's say that's the end goal discussion.

For the discussion about how to have a long distance relationship , you should verify their identity first before you get too interested in them.

Once you know that you're actually talking to the person in the pictures, you're going to have to trust the other person because you can't be around them and you have to trust him that they want to be with you and they're not meeting and dating other people at the same time.    you're going to have to try to visit each other at some regular intervals to help keep the spark  going if you need to do that, so one or both of you should be able to afford trips to see each other.

The first trip to meet each other will be  important because that's where you will learn if you actually have any interest in each other when you meet, as well as to verify certain things about each other.

You have to depend on texting or video calls or phone calls to keep communication.  There may be time zones to consider as well.

Get more information in the /r/longdistance forum.

And whether this guy works out or not, it sounds like you will keep doing this because you want to meet guys from the other places.  So just be cautious of guys who try to move things too fast. 

For example , they express that they love you already, or that they can't wait to marry you but you two have just started talking, etc.  And above all, don't send them any money if they give you a sob story about their life or troubles.

Someone who really wants to be with you is going to be very careful about making you think they're only after you for money.

Everyone has struggles in life and everyone needs more money, but someone who wants to be with you in the long term is  going to be able to tell you their problems without expecting that you're going to solve it for them by sending them money.",1625097704

Many folks just decide what a character is like, and they are surprised to hear that their work is conventional (conventional is my favorite swear word!). You don't MAKE them unique. You allow yourself to live through, and since the lens of YOU is already one of kind, the refraction of the character is equally new and compelling.

It is much more about allowing than making.",1625097704

I wouldn't say rape fantasies are 'internalized misogyny.' Internalized misogyny would be a woman saying shit like... ""Sally got raped because her skirt was too short,"" or ""Allison slept her way to the top; no way she got to her position on her own merits."" Rape fantasies seem to be more about power exchange, either (1) relinquishing it or (2) reclaiming agency/power in a scenario that is scary to many women.

Going up to women (even online) and saying ""Your sexual fantasies are deviant/wrong/maladaptive, and you need to examine why you are turned on by XYZ"" when you are NOT their therapist (and especially if you are not a therapist in general) is not only gross and irresponsible but also highly damaging.",1625097704

To be fair, this isn't just a problem I have with Code Realize but with most of the major long-form otome games I buy, and I think the main issue is that in addition to not a great deal actually happening most of the time, and the voice acting slowing things down even further, that the moment to moment dialogue just isn't all that interesting even though I'm sure the overall story is great. Turning the voices off and focusing on the text, I found the dialogue / narration simple bordering on dull, but maybe that's just me. With Cafe Enchante I was able to slog through the two routes I played by cutting the voices off before they finished playing (sacrilege!), but I'm beginning to think Otomate games maybe aren't for me...

As others have said, mobile / indie games get going a lot faster with seemingly fewer scenes with the characters just spinning their wheels, so maybe they'd be a better fit for you? I definitely appreciated getting through three routes of Cinderella Phenomenon in the time it took me to get through a single route of Cafe Enchante where very little was actually happening.

Sorta. Heat is generally good when programming and bad when idle for flash, but there are still limits to how hot you want consumer NAND. Also, it can beneficial to spread heat from the controller to the flash. The general rule ""NAND likes heat"" is incorrect as usually it references JEDEC (which is not oriented to the kind of temperatures we'd be preventing here) and further, the impact of temperature on flash is more complicated than that - through cross-temperature, dwell time, amount of wear (PEC), write intensity, etc. I've covered the topic extensively on my discord but also a bit on Reddit (with technical sources), however when we're talking consumer usage cooling is more about aesthetics *unless* your environment is particularly poor - in which case, cooling everything is worthwhile.

Others have mentioned key inputs that only you know.  Make a table of all your debts (car loans, home mortgage, college loans etc.), your obligations (paying for college education for kids, any other family support needs, etc.), your expenses (others said three, but I would say 12 months, as it looks at payments like property tax, insurance payments, car maintenance, home improvement, vacations, etc.) and all your incomes (you may have pensions, current investment income, any business income, in addition to your wages).  On second thoughts, look at a representative year (non-Covid) as many of us had lower expenses this past year.

Make sure you pay off all debts on non-appreciating assets, keep six months of emergency cash and then invest the rest per your risk tolerance.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Why on Earth would I care that he confessed? What I asked for is meaningful physical evidence. A confession is, again, just words. It's enough to be accepted as evidence in a court room, but you were probing as to whether or not I personally believe or disbelieve in the women's statements and all the allegations. I said that I require physical evidence as my personal burden of proof. Manipulated confessions are made all the time under all manner of pressure. Those are false. The confession in this case was obtained under fraudulent pretenses, rendering it invalid as evidence in the first place, even in the court. 

There are many reasons why someone would confess to something they didn't do, especially when falsely misled by police or other legal authorities. He ""confessed"" for the sake of a deal that wasn't kept. There's no way to tell if such a ""confession"" is worth more than a piece of used dental floss. 

False confessions under duress/lying procedures and pressure happen constantly. That's why troublesome actors in the system who perpetuate such were forcefully rebuked today with the judicial ruling.",1625097707

She has a plentiful mindset. At the time when she is supposed to be showing you her absolute best this is what you get. People are never more in love than when engaged and thinking of the future together. How do you think she will be in the future when she has to face problems that are actually happening and not scenarios that she has just dreamt up?

Either she's just given you the poorest excuse in the history of language or she means what she says: she's not sure she's capable of being a step mom and wife. Rather than put her feelings on the table for discussion she instead starts an affair. She has shot your joint future out of the sky.

You are most likely right. The nudes are going to the affair partner too. She hasn't blocked him but that's irrelevant. She can unblock him at the drop of a hat. Besides, she still works with him so he can 'grab her ass' (Probably a euphemism) and she can 'hug' him (again a euphemism) throughout the day. In fact, he spends more time with her than you do.

Ask yourself, other than hollow words and tears what has she ACTUALLY done to show remorse? You caught her. I bet that's the reason for her apology. She's demonstrated that she's \*so sorry\* by keeping him on her social media and taking the affair underground.

If you had not have caught her, how long would this have carried on for? What would have happened as their affair progressed?

New relationships are fraught with danger so she's decided that you'll make a good back up plan if it doesn't play out well and you'll give her a soft landing if her monkey branching attempt fails.

Never be someone's back up plan.

Leave. This is an exit affair. She doesn't want a future with you. She liked the shiny ring and the 'finacee' label but didn't consider where it leads. She doesn't want to be a wife &amp; step mom. If it's not this guy then there will be others until she can get out.",1625097707

He was a nice guy having to be on camera and negotiating his angst. I couldn‚Äôt stand that she was pressing him so hard.

‚ÄúHundreds of thousands of Americans have sought medical care for post-Covid health problems that they had not been diagnosed with before becoming infected with the coronavirus, according to the largest study to date of long-term symptoms in Covid-19 patients.

The study, tracking the health insurance records of nearly two million people in the United States who contracted the coronavirus last year, found that one month or more after their infection, almost one-quarter ‚Äî 23 percent ‚Äî of them sought medical treatment for new conditions.

Those affected were all ages, including children. Their most common new health problems were pain, including in nerves and muscles; breathing difficulties; high cholesterol; malaise and fatigue; and high blood pressure. Other issues included intestinal symptoms; migraines; skin problems; heart abnormalities; sleep disorders; and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.

**Post-Covid health problems were common even among people who had not gotten sick from the virus at all,** the study found. While nearly half of patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19 experienced subsequent medical issues, so did 27 percent of people who had mild or moderate symptoms and 19 percent of people who said they were asymptomatic‚Äù

"nextfuckinglevel","t5_m0bnr","""The designer of Princess Diana‚Äôs revenge dress, Christina Stambolian, revealed that the dress had actually been made for Diana three years prior. At the time, the princess had been too nervous to wear it because it was ‚Äútoo daring.‚Äù

In fact, Diana had initially planned on wearing a different dress to this event. Instead, she made a last-minute switch and opted for the revenge dress. Anna Harvey, her former stylist, said that she wanted to look ‚Äúlike a million dollars‚Äù that night. If the dress was Diana‚Äôs small act of revenge, she sure did look like a million bucks doing it.""

I'm guessing that when the dress was made she was already well aware their marriage was imploding, and that there was a good chance that eventually she'd wear it in exactly this context.",1625097709

He's not just a stupid kid that accidentally got a bunch of viewers on YouTube and the money fell in his lap. Kid had a full scholarship in Chemical Engineering somewhere and passed up on it cuz the money he was making from the content he was putting out. He said and proved in the fight that he puts in the work. 

He pointed out he's not going to put himself into positions to take dangerous fights. I've been an mma fan from day 1. UFC, WCC, Extreme Fighting, Pride, Rings, all of it. To hate on these guys for taking safe fights is silly cuz the UFC just did it today turning down Ricky Simon for O'Malley cuz Simon was asking for a catch weight accepting a fight 10 days out. 

The Paul bros boxing mma guys shouldn't be an issue either. Boxers have already stepped into the cage, big name boxers too. These mma guys are tripping over themselves trying to fight these kids cuz of the money and that's another reason to like these guys. Jake is a huge proponent of better pay for mma fighters.

"anesthesiology","t5_2uoic","Remember: You are ALREADY more highly-trained than a CRNA by the time you graduate residency. Fellowship is not a magical shield. Hospitals that are choosing CRNAs to replace MDs are trying to save money. If you are fellowship-trained, they might just assume that you want even MORE money than a ""lowly"" non-fellowship Anesthesiologist. By this logic, doing fellowship and making yourself more expensive only makes you a higher priority for replacement by a business-trained hospital administrator who is trying to trim the budget. His board-room buddies are going to high-five him/her all the way to the bank to cash their bonus. They don't respect your fellowship AT ALL unless it helps them achieve their own goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

And every residency program everywhere has a HUGE bias to recruit and retain as many residents as possible to give one more year of indentured servitude as a fellow. The majority of academic anesthesiologists actually have NO IDEA what private practice is really like. I love to look back and laugh at all the ridiculous stereotypes that were perpetuated. They made it seem like you were going to be begging on the street if you don't have a fellowship...or two...or even better, go for three! 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated 3 years ago from a big academic residency and went straight into private practice. I have never regretted my decision for even half a second. My strategy was that if the CRNA's are actually going to take it all over eventually, you're much better off getting out of training ASAP to make good money until the flow dries up. This was also my strategy to protect against joining a group then not getting a partner-share if the group was bought out before I became a full partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to throw a different perspective at you. Reality is that half my class did fellowships, most of them feel like it probably set them up to do what they want. But DO NOT do a fellowship out of fear.

Christians have to pay a different tax than muslims.

The life of a christian it's worth less than that of a muslim...(there is a hadith that says that, if a christian is killed by a muslim, the muslim will have to pay half the money. If he killed a muslim, he would have to pay the full amount).

And I'm sure there are more. Remeber, islam doesn't promote equality.

"halo","t5_2qixk","&gt;Training, I won't comment on because I don't know for certain the regimens of both programs. But I will say that Spartan-IIIs couldn't have had much better training if they did

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloStory/comments/iypo3n/spartans_iii_and_the_misconceptions_around_them/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) a post that goes over alot of this stuff with sources.

The Spartan 3 program was led by a Spartan 2 and the person who trained the S2s intending to train them harder than the 2s were, training is one of the things they are probably clear above the 2s in.

&gt;The augmentations, on the other hand, I disagree. Spartan IIs weren't just given chemical/hormonal augmentations, they were given mechanical augmentations as well.

How the augmentations were administered has no bearing on how powerful they are, Spartan 4s had by far the most invasive augmentation process yet they are much worse than the 3s or 2s.

&gt;And in terms of Kurt saying the augmentations were a 'quantum leap' ahead, he meant in terms of a lowered mortality rate.

This could be a reasonable take on that statement, except for the fact he mentions the lowered mortality rate immediately after, there would be no point of the first statement then if that's what he was talking about.

Regardless if you don't buy that, there isn't any sources saying the 3s augmentations were worse, so in the end were left with a statement that maybe the 3s are much better versus nothing for the other camp.

&gt;Evidently, while Spartan-IIs were stronger/faster

Debateable, S3s often have feats way better than what S2s are capable of at the time. Tom for example outreacts Kelly even back when he was wearing SPI armor in Glasslands, and currently holds the speed record for any Spartan of outrunning a Warthog which is like 120kph. G059 can evade a barrage of Carbine rounds in SPI armor while Chief can't in Mjolnir. Owen quickly solos a hunter pair, even fighting one in close combat in Mark 4 while all of Blue Team was shitting themselves trying to fight a Hunter pair with the same armor.

&gt;I'll concede that maybe it isn't a broad gap, but Chief's augmentations still would probably win out over N6's.

I mean an answer for how they compare overall is given to us straight up in one of the recent guidebooks, according to the Spartan Field Manual S3s are the near equals of S2s in a firefight, I'm guessing above average S3s like N6 would be similar or above the capabilities of a 2.",1625097711

"iamatotalpieceofshit","t5_3jj03","Well there's a number of possibilities. That ziptie was extremely tight. Possibly cutting off circulation for days to weeks. It most likely also caused a collapsed trachea. And esophagus. Which means it'd be nearly impossible for the cat to be able to take down food (solid or liquid) and water. It would die in a few more days at this rate. 

The other possiblity, albeit unlikely; when they cut the ziptie off of it's neck. A multitude of things could happen. Number one being that the cat would be subject to what is called ""toxic blood poisoning"". The other could be that given the release of the ziptie, the cat would immediately have blood flow back into it's neck and head, to much to fast. And end up putting it into a coma and then death. The fact of the matter is, between these scenarios. IF the cat managed to live through it, then the cost would probably be extremely expensive for reabilitation. I know most of us love animals, but the cost would be to steep when that money could be put to use towards keeping a human alive. A ""more valuable member to society"". Although looking at this humans atrocities I'd go on a limb and say as fucking if. 

TLDR: ziptie probably collapsed it's trachea and esophagus making food and water unlikely for consumption. Or taking the ziptie off could lead to blood poisoning. Either way, the cat is 99% a goner.",1625097711

A bunch of my PS4 cases have that generic cookie cutter font on the spines which I personally hate, so my next thought is to buy American covers, I see the price and throw that idea out the window, then I go to digital scans, that one's a lost cause due to the bad quality of the scan and print, which will make it stand out amongst your collection

So, I took to designing my own slip covers, to just slide over the standard cases. Get them professionally printed, and roughly 100 of them for the same price as shipping over a single American cover

It is gonna be a lot better quality and price wise to go this route, so think about it, and browse here for inspiration

However, before I went down this path, I did try my hand at doing a digital recreation of the Nathan Drake cover, using the best scan I could find, an overlay of the banner, and a different scan of the spine. Ain't the best, it's got both American and UK ratings on, and not gonna be as sharp as the real thing, but that's the reason I moved to custom, so if you are staying on your course then this is the best I can get you:

"LightNovels","t5_2sloz","The other person already answered you,

But I might as well give my own complains about this as well. lol

I kinda feel you on this one, even if not directly about the same thing.

I just wish a ""harem situation"" or better say ""more than 1 girl falling in love with MC"" does not happen AT ALL.

I know sometimes it's fine and maybe even good writing for a story, if there is some drama like this, but I personally prefer for it not to be there in the first place.

So i was pretty disheartened when Chastille was revealed to have truly fall in love with the MC.. I was like ah come on,  not because I was scared of this story become a harem.

Rather I kind of found this to be a lose\~lose situation in a lot of the cases when such a thing happens in some story.

Coz the girl would either:

* have to deal with heart break or regret or keep on forcing herself to move on but usually it wont happen fast or easy either and keep at it for many volumes or maybe even worse and until the story end, she never get a true ""moving on"" plot focused on her.
* the girl get in with another person in some way easily or quickly, which most of the times feels forced.

So I'm always like why even create this situation in the first place.

just not make her fall in love with the MC in the first place and just made it be admiration or gratitude for saving her, why make it awkward... lol",1625097712

It‚Äôs no secret that diamonds and gold come at a cost. The environmental price is well-documented, and has in part led to the recent boom in lab-grown diamonds. According to above-ground diamond creator¬†Diamond Foundry, for each carat of natural diamond mined industrially, companies move up to 250 tonnes of earth, use 127 gallons of water and release 143 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

She then filed a suit agaisnt me and my my buddy, claiming we we spitting on her dog. We go to court, she a is no show, we provided the ticket number. The judge tells the court clerk our cases need to be conjoined with another and they tell us to come back on a specific date.   


When we go to court again,  my buddy and I show up think it a simple matter. There was a lot of lawyers in the court room.  She had four.  There a lot of confusion.  Turns out, our case was dismissed because she didn't show up at the original hearing, and we were suppose to be witness against her and her dogs for the new and separate matter.   


Turns out, she was having sex with all of her dogs, filming it, and selling it on the internet.  Only reason we were witness, was to testify that she bat shit insane during our encounter with her.",1625097713

Lacto blueberries, I know you've made them. Rinse a few of the berries (to lessen excess salt), add like a teaspoon of the juice (just enough to make them easy to smoosh), muddle in the glass.

Honey Ginger, take a bit of your ginger bug and some fresh ginger, smother it in twice as much honey, let it sit for a week or two, tasting as you go. It'll probably thin a bit, then strain when you like the flavor and thin with water until it's easily pourable.

Gin. I make my own but any good gin should do. Aviation,  Bombay Sapphire, the Botanist, Hendricks, etc.

Lemon juice, freshly squeezed.

"TheExpanse","t5_2xi70","You know how the first two episodes of the show are very heavy on political and worldbuilding exposition? I think the situation you're proposing would've required even more exposition to the point where it might've inhibited audience comprehension.

"rpg_gamers","t5_2su0w","One advice, don't start on the hardest difficulty if you are unfamiliar with the game. This is not one of those git gud games like a Souls game for example. You need to learn the mechanics and know how the battle system works, before you can start breaking it.

Tell me what characters do you have. Have you recruited a full party yet? You can recruit up to 3 people at the time (out of 5 characters) and you can get them without fighting if you know where they are at. 

It would also help to know what classes you are using. Since this game uses an armor system, an unbalanced party can be a problem. The best party compositions are either full physical damage, full magical damage or split 2-2. If you split 1-3 or 3-1, one of your characters will be at a huge disadvantage.

What fights are you facing right now? Can you avoid them and do other quests that don't require combat? Leveling is also a big thing here, an enemy 1 single level above you might be too strong. Try doing other stuff or other fights and come back to the troubling fight later.",1625097713

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","Getting into private industry after spending time in the military is HARD. Most of what you learn, including social skills, simply don't transfer well to a modern corporate environment. 

At my old job at a FAANG I volunteered to help veterans find jobs in the private sector by helping with resumes and giving mock interviews. I helped them translate the work they did into language that made sense to civilians. 

The experience was rewarding, but also very eye opening into how things work in the military. You won't learn any useful CS skills there and the military mindset will need to be essentially de-programed from your brain. So it's a big step backwards and I would seriously reconsider if your main reason for joining is for experience to get a CS job in the industry.",1625097713

One of my techniques as far as spending more time with her would be to stay after class and ask for extra help that I didn't need, so early on in the semester after all this time, I basically decided to make my move we had always hugged and everything like that , I was taller than her by this point so after getting the extra help after class one day I kissed her on the forehead a couple times and moved down to kiss her on the lips, she reciprocated but stopped it so nobody would see us, she apologized , I told her there was no reason to a couple days later she gave me her address to her apartment and said that she wanted to talk about what happened,  so I found my way over there we had a talk about it, and next thing I knew we were making out, I ate her out and I fucked her for a good 45ish secondsüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ, but I got better with practice though, I could give more details but I wanted to keep the story as short as possible if you want to know anything else that wouldn't be identifying, you can ask lol",1625097714

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Daliƒá didn't overachieve with the WC, with a better coach we wouldn't have struggled that much with Denmark and Russia. He got the job when the team was in complete shambles. We lost to Turkey and Iceland away and drew with Finland at home, and compromised the WC qualification. The previous coach was sacked and Daliƒá got the job because nobody else wanted it, and he admits that himself. The WC was the last opportunity to achieve something at the international level for several players who underachieved at previous tournaments. So we were going through that knockout stage purely on individual brilliance of the said players, Daliƒá was just lucky to be there at that time and place.

Then, after the World Cup, all his tactical limitations and lack of a plan came to light. We got humiliated in the Nations League in 2018 and got relegated, which we thought was fine because we presumed the players were still hungover from the World Cup. But during the Euro qualifiers, we continued struggling. Barely scraped past Azerbaijan and Wales at home, drew with them away. Lost to Hungary away. Euros got postponed, and we got another humiliating Nations League campaign, this time even more humiliating than the first one. Sure, one can argue that finishing above Portugal and France in the group is unrealistic‚Äìand it is‚Äìbut we really expected them to put up a bit more fight. Not to mention that we almost got relegated again because we had the same number of points as Sweden, but luckily we had better GD. During the WC qualifiers this spring we lost to Slovenia and scraped past Cyprus thanks to a lucky goal. I have never experienced being afraid of facing Malta until then, and we couldn't score against them until Peri≈°iƒá and Modriƒá got substituted in.

During all this time after the World Cup, we kept getting results thanks to individual talent rather than having a strategy or a trained system or tactics. Daliƒá kept talking about a generational shift, yet three years later he still relies on a few players from Russia. We had two players making their competitive debuts at the Euros. We had plenty of time to test them before the tournament, but we didn't because God knows why. Daliƒá kept making ""experiments"" that had no sense like trying out Brekalo, who is a left winger, on the right back position. Or trying out Pa≈°aliƒá, who is an attacking midfielder, on the defensive midfielder position (resulting in the worst game of football I ever saw us play, we were lucky Portugal scored only four that game). Wasted time in the Nations League on testing a system which wasn't working and which we never played again. When the Euros began, none of us in Croatia knew what system we would be playing in or which players would be the starters. He kept playing them out of position against England and Czechia and got us on the brink of elimination in the group stage (Peri≈°iƒá revealed that the players had a crisis meeting ahead of the Scotland game). He barely gave minutes to Vla≈°iƒá who was our best player in the qualifiers.

We Croatia fans here in this thread aren't mad that we got eliminated by Spain, they are objectively a better team now. We are mad about the lack of tactics, the lack of planning, the lack of organization, our national team is in absolute chaos. And Daliƒá is not the right man to fix it. He maybe was back when he got appointed but he is not anymore.

I feel like I didn't even say everything I had to say, but this will do.

Afterwards we had a little party at our FC house and did all the remaining activities in game that day in our dresses! 

It was an amazing thing to do in game with your significant other. It was so very cute and I am sure will stay in my mind for the rest of my life as a happy memory with my future wife .

A condom is sterile inside the packaging. Once you open it and take it out it gets contaminated with everything including germ particles, piss &amp;/or fecal particals and ofc sperm particles. If in any point you can contaminated the sterile part, ie the rolled up part,ie the outside later with sperm it's a dangerous road. It dosen't have a 100% chance but still there a slim chance.

He was with his wife Gimena Accardi (also an Argentine actor). 

As they were parking in the garage (doesn't mention the specific time), they heard a loud noise but didn't think much of it. They got in the elevator. When the doors opened on the first floor there was another loud noise and a cloud of dust; they realized the garage had collapsed. They started running. Two or three minutes later, they heard the final loud noise and were surrounded by an even bigger cloud of dust (presumably when the building collapsed).

Couldn't find any articles in English with his full account so I translated it myself:

""We were coming back from dinner. As usual, I parked the car in the garage. We heard a really loud noise but we didn‚Äôt realize what was going on. And six or seven seconds later, when we got in the elevator, and the elevator moved, stopping in the lobby as usual, a really strong cloud of dust emerged, a really loud noise‚Ä¶ We didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. We didn‚Äôt know if it was a tornado or an [terrorist] attack. It was like a movie. We started running with three or four other people that were there, we weren‚Äôt many. They were overwhelmed with anxiety, obviously. And it was only then that we realized that part of what was the garage had collapsed, many cars had sunk down, alarms were going off. Gime [my wife] makes me realize how close we were to not tell this story. Two or three more minutes go by, of not understanding well, in a state of shock. And then I tell the other people, because they were very nervous, and primarily to Gimena to cross. And then we hear a noise that‚Äôs impossible to describe. Along with the noise, there was a cloud of dust so big that we could not see each other. We were right next to each other and we couldn‚Äôt see each other. That was when we ran desperately and Gime hit herself really hard against a tree or a palm tree. She gets like a very big egg [bump] in the head, very big. It scared me because it was not instantaneous with a lot of blood, no blood coming out, as if it was a bump or a clot, I don‚Äôt know what to call it. And then there was silence. We found ourselves covered with debris and the neighbors started coming out to render us aid with whatever there was around, with water. And then the police and the firefighters started to arrive‚Ä¶ and the rest you already know.""",1625097715

"camping","t5_2qk80","Last summer (and this summer is probably worse, for the same reason, just x2) the bear population in my province was quite high, due to no spring hunt (covid.)  So there I was, cheerfully doing my minimalist camping in a lovely forest right by a lake...in a heatwave...and of course the bears are hot and want to cool down by (or in) the lake.  I'm walking along a narrow path by the lake, when I realized there was a bear in the bushes RIGHT BESIDE ME, but walking the other way.  I could have reached out and touched it, it was that close.  It wasn't a very BIG bear, maybe came up to my hip?  But it was a bear...RIGHT BESIDE ME.  I just kept on walking, and as far as I know the bear did too.  THEN, that night, in my tent, almost asleep...I hear this snuffling right outside my tent.  It's the bear (or a different bear, I have no idea.)  I had no traces of food at my campsite, and I knew (or hoped!) that the bear wasn't interested in me as food, it was just curious, but I'm lying on the ground, and if this bear gets caught in the guy lines of my tent then I am now trapped on the ground underneath a panicked bear.  So I clapped my hands and  shouted, and the bear took off...but then it came back...and I scared it off again, and said ""F- this"" and slept the rest of the night in the back seat of my car.  I left the next day.  All of my camping this summer will be in the south of the province.",1625097716

Also, for lair action: Darkness cloud and maybe like 1d4 skeletons?

Edit: Another ones I could think of:

Each time he gets hit by a melee attack, the attacker suffers 1d4 necrotic damage

Hover speed (which is different from flying) of 40ft

17-18 AC

Enough HP to survive 4-6 rounds

Twice a day can Misty Step and/or Invisibility

Multiattack: 2 or 3 attacks

Chain Grapple: Deals 3d6 damage bludgeoning. Can choose to restrain target instead of damaging it, Strength escape DC of 17

Polearm: 2d6 (+ STR ofc, also on Chain Grapple) piercing and 3d6 necrotic damage

Legendary Actions 3/Turn

Cast a cantrip (Eldritch Blast?): 1 Legendary Action


Move 20ft without provoking opportunity attacks: 1 LA

Hate Wave: All targets in a 30ft radius must succeed on a 17 DC Wisdom saving throw or suffer 2d8 psychic damage and get knocked to the ground: 2 LA",1625097716

This is interesting because we're taught this going into BMT but as soon as we get to our first base it shifts to: Your new goal is to become CMSgt.

This is also interesting since all of our most critical enlisted positions (SNCOs) aren't testing over their knowledge on Air Force history, updated uniform regulations, or changing standards.

Play 2 Kiteroid, for survivability.

Swap Supercharge for something else, even Counter Gate is better since most decks right now can wipe monsters off the board.

Uforoid and Truckroid are, again, too slow, but 1 of the Truckroids can stay since it can get to very big attack values.

Try getting Expressroid and Barbaroid, since Mixeroid into Expressroid with 2 Roids in the GY is 3/4 of Barbaroid's materials and it's an absolute beast of a card and on top of that Expressroid is one of the listed materials for Strealth Union (aka, budget Plasma)

*****
&gt; The conservative climate group KlimaUnion, which is made up of party members of the governing / alliance, has a position paper in which the members argue that Germany could become the world&amp;#039;s first industrialised country running on 100-percent renewable energy supply as early as 2030 and simultaneously reduce citizens&amp;#039; expenses on transport, heating and power use.

&gt; In the paper, KlimaUnion argues that Germany could save up to 63 billion euros in energy imports per year if it manages to achieve a complete transition to renewable energy, which could be turned into a &amp;quot;Growth booster&amp;quot; in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Group member Wiebke Winter said the position paper should be seen as an &amp;quot;Argumentation aid&amp;quot; for the conservative / alliance&amp;#039;s election manifesto that offers &amp;quot;Concrete proposals&amp;quot; on starting to make Germany climate neutral already during the next legislative period until 2025.

Perhaps you're different if the team's loaded with 5\* weapons and high constellations? Since Jean's c4, I can probably guess the rest.

As for overworld, most of my favorite units are Lv90 F10 and my ocd brain refuses to let me use them anymore. Forming this kind of party there will probably have to wait till I've F10ed my entire roster T\_T",1625097718

Apparently everyone's praising A Plague Tale. I don't have a PS5, won't have one for a couple of years and generally don't play indie games, but still it's another apparently quality game that i'll have access to once I do get a PS5, so that's a win. 

I've never played a wrestling game. I guess there's every chance I won't enjoy a wrestling game given that I don't enjoy watching wrestling and haven't played a fighter game since Tekken 2. Still, it will give me a taste of what a wrestling game is and I appreciate that. I'd perhaps have bought one wrestling game or another if it were on a deep, deep sale, so again this one's a win for me. Not a huge win, but i'm happy enough with it. Even if it turns out I don't like it, or indeed never download it. 

I wouldn't have purchased Black Ops 4, unless it was extremely low cost. I've not played much of any COD multiplayer and, due to PS+, I already have COD WWII and Black Ops 3 to dive into should I wish to. Having said that I have seen a few clips of people playing Black Ops 4 and it looked quite different and quite enjoyable. So i'm not sure but it could be a game that I consider is worth trying.",1625097718

I injured my left pinkie 15 odd years ago, big scar that runs from top to bottom. 
The scar tissue on my finger stopped proper mobility.
After 2 years of on and off trying to learn and pushing myself a bit more over the last few months, that pinkie while still kinda fucked can do a fuck tonne more than before (including being able to put pressure on it). 

I'm not saying that it's perfect rehab or anything like that but it's really good! Patience and practice and a little mind over body mentality can go along way.",1625097718

This created an entire generation buried in debt because we were all told to go to college or else.  There is a reason why for an entire decade, we didn't have enough HVAC, plumbers, and other trade jobs while having an overly educated working class.

I bought the Complete version a long time back and ran it and it's kind of a mess. Admittedly, I haven't read the new version and that may have been fixed. The clues and threads are little clunky and need to be clearly mapped to be understood. The path of clue to clue can and quite often does completely skip important parts of the story. If you can see how things are connected and ensure clues are found (another issue is clues can be hard to find) you can ensure the scenes flow well.

There are a slew of other issues such as the hook and the technology involved in the final chapter. It's just not that good.

I've had some pretty severe pushback from CoC purists about saying this about Masks and I don't take anyone's fun away from them. Personally I feel that the campaign just needs far too much work to make it fun.

If you want a campaign that is great out of the box, go for Nocturnum. I've run it several times to completion and it's so much fun.",1625097719

Talks about mental health   
  
\--------

I‚Äôm not sure whether to give GP a pass on this. I was probably suffering from depression during my time there. Partly due to school pressure, etc. But GP did push me to pray more and be happy about Jesus, etc. and put on a smiling face. I learned later this is similar to what happens in the Mormon church. Sorry to any devout Mormons reading this.   
  
The larger problem is that GP is the cause of the depression and anxiety, something PED chose not to address. They also do things that contribute to poor mental health, including   
Lack of sleep, constant activities   
Soft pressure to visit your family not as often and stay near a GP location to attend their church and activities.

"AmITheDevil","t5_27t6v0","That's not quite true - if you have the ability to travel within the US with minimal financial or other barriers, it isn't super difficult to find providers for elective abortion under roughly 20-22 weeks.

Of course for most people ability to travel IS limited in one way or another (finances, time off work, needing to arrange childcare, needing to keep pregnancy and/or abortion secret, health concerns, etc etc). But if you're in the small subset of people who have the ability to travel somewhere like New York, Chicago, Seattle, etc and stay for 1-3 nights (depending on how far along they are + health concerns + the state's laws) on short notice, (or of course, happen to live i a place like that), finding a provider should not be an issue. 

Severe risk to the pregnant person or fetal indication absolutely are reasons for abortion post-12 weeks (which, like you said, are a small subset of abortions performed) but they don't become the reason for the majority of procedures until roughly 20-24 weeks (research on this is fairly limited, but that's what the studies we do have point to). 

If the person in the OP is real, there is always the possibility that the sister has non-financial barriers that prevent her from accessing an abortion post-12 weeks, but there are absolutely providers out there. Not as many as there should be, but anti choice politicians and groups benefit from spreading a perception that there are almost none, so that people become discouraged as soon as they realize how far along they are and end up never truly seeing abortion as an option, even if it would be in reality.",1625097720

*****
&gt; The conservative climate group KlimaUnion, which is made up of party members of the governing / alliance, has a position paper in which the members argue that Germany could become the world&amp;#039;s first industrialised country running on 100-percent renewable energy supply as early as 2030 and simultaneously reduce citizens&amp;#039; expenses on transport, heating and power use.

&gt; In the paper, KlimaUnion argues that Germany could save up to 63 billion euros in energy imports per year if it manages to achieve a complete transition to renewable energy, which could be turned into a &amp;quot;Growth booster&amp;quot; in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

"LSD","t5_2qhvj","Ape boy I'm going to chalk this up to you don't have much experience with marijuana or people who use it. Also, they did not find evidence that DUI was ok.... a .05 BAC (two standard drinks) does not equate to a DUI. The reason .05 BAC is not considered a DUI is because it does not impair your ability to operate a motor vehicle and they compared it to ingesting 100mg of marijuana and found that there is minimal evidence it impairs your high-level driving skills. AKA if OP and his friends smoked and drove it is not the end of the world, give them a break. Like I said earlier if somebody is driving high out of their gourd then most likely they're going 5mph and miss a turn.

edit: in my state the legal limit is .08 BAC equivalent to 160mg of THC. which is a fuck ton of pot so there's a very good chance OP and friends were under that level.",1625097721

IME, resumes are not terribly detailed, and instead the cover letter is where you provide more details for a small subset of especially position-relevant experiences, in hopes that together your resume and cover letter will get you to the interview stage where you‚Äôll have free reign to do a deep dive on the details in all their technical glory. But of course, the question is how to get to the interview‚Ä¶

So given your feedback on this specific resume, what general/not-specific-to-this-particular-resume tips would you provide for how to avoid being too vague while also neither (a) having your resume span 10 pages nor (b) needing to cut the bullets down to just one or two experiences?

Go ahead and take a look at the sheer amount of effort put into crafting such a beautiful and dynamic world while being strung along a fantastically thought out story filled with characters you can actually form emotional bonds with. 

Go ahead and tell me the game is soulless even after watching a kind hearted man with a terminal illness go on a path of redemption not long before he succumbs to his illness, leaving all of his long term friends, loved ones, and companions behind, inspiring them to become better versions of theirselves just to fill the void that his death had left on their lives. 

Like have we even played the same game? RDR2 is such a well developed masterpiece of a game made with so much passion and dedication and yet idiots like you have the gall to claim that Rockstar is soulless?

And I actually fucking hate that fools like you keep claiming that it takes 12 years for them to develop these games when that is literally incorrect. Go fact check the garbage you spew out you moron and you would see that it only took 8 years of development, which is one year longer than bethesda took to make Fallout 4 and two years longer than it took them to make Skyrim, so quit it with the bitching about how long it takes for them to make a games that are leagues better than anything bethesda is capable of.

"TrueDoTA2","t5_2tk78","I'm no expert, but I dabble with the icy freak

To know which skill to max in any given game, let's take a look at the hero's toolkit:

**Cold Feet**:  
\- Unreliable, dispellable stun.  
\- Levelling up adds duration (significant), cast range (significant), and damage (negligible).  
\- Cooldown is lowered, but insignificant as it is already low enough.  
\- Mana cost doesn't change.  
When to Max first? When your team has other stuns and you're going for an early snowball / death squad, just running at enemies in their jungle as 3 or 4 heroes.

**Ice Vortex:**  
\- Tiny area slow, vision, and magic damage amplification; with decent cast range.  
\- Levelling up increases slow, magic damage amp.  
\- Cooldown is lowered, has some significance for spammability.  
\- Mana cost increases.  
When to Max first? Most games, when you want to increase the damage from your complete combo with ultimate; especially important to have maxed by the time you buy the shard at 20 minutes, since that unlocks AA's hidden potential.

**Chilling Touch:**  
\- AA's best trading skill, damage modifier on right click with added attack range; and a mini-slow.  
\- Levelling up increases damage and attack range bonus.  
\- Cooldown is lowered significantly, but is it viable?  
\- Mana cost increases quite a bit.  
When to Max first? When lanes are very static, your lane partner is a passive / defensive ""I want my farm"" kind of hero, no kill potential on enemy lanes, and laning stage seems long and drawn out.  


**Read more for which skills to pick at levels 1 to 3.**

Judging by this toolkit, if you were to rely completely on yourself for zoning / trading with an enemy support in the jungle area beside the lane, you might want to skill **E-Q-W**; giving yourself stronger trade at level one with Chilling Touch, then a possible stun if the enemy support stands his ground to trade with you, and finally the vortex to increase your damage, slow them down, and add vision while chasing.

If you were to work with a lane-partner to reliably stun an enemy, you would rather skill **E-Q-Q-W**, if your lane partner has a leash / root / reliable stun (WK, Sven, CK, Slark) to ensure Cold Feet lands, because the extra damage ticks, cast range, and 0.5s stun for no extra mana cost is favorable to spending mana on 3 skills.

If the enemies have a dispel for Cold Feet, or you have excess mana and no kill potential on the enemy support, or you can't manage the three skills well enough; it would be advantageous to go **E-Q-E**, doubling down on Chilling Touch for much better lane trading.",1625097723

Moreover, when you are speaking with the admitting clerk (the one you talk to after you see the triage nurse), tell them you want your chart made ""confidential"".  This will prevent them from telling any family members if you're in the hospital when they call the patient location phone number.  When they ask for your emergency contact information, make sure to give them the name of a friend, or anyone but your parents.  On the off-chance that you're ""formed"" (i.e. made an involuntary patient under the *Mental Health Act*, they must notify one of your emergency contacts.

*****
&gt; The conservative climate group KlimaUnion, which is made up of party members of the governing / alliance, has a position paper in which the members argue that Germany could become the world&amp;#039;s first industrialised country running on 100-percent renewable energy supply as early as 2030 and simultaneously reduce citizens&amp;#039; expenses on transport, heating and power use.

&gt; In the paper, KlimaUnion argues that Germany could save up to 63 billion euros in energy imports per year if it manages to achieve a complete transition to renewable energy, which could be turned into a &amp;quot;Growth booster&amp;quot; in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Group member Wiebke Winter said the position paper should be seen as an &amp;quot;Argumentation aid&amp;quot; for the conservative / alliance&amp;#039;s election manifesto that offers &amp;quot;Concrete proposals&amp;quot; on starting to make Germany climate neutral already during the next legislative period until 2025.

"Malazan","t5_2t1dv","I have a similar opinion. For GoTM, I... 'Like' is a strong word. More like *Appreciate*. Deadhouse gates was *pretty good*, but the pacing dragged, not mutch happened, and there was so much going on but most of it did not really tie togeather. &gt;!The Felisin part and the hunt for the titular Deadhouse barely crossed over, and the Chain of Dogs, while interesting, was kind of repetitive.!&lt; MoI, on the other hand, is a much more *coherent* story than the first two. I am only part way through, but it certainly *seems* like all of the threads are going to converge on each other properly. Having returning characters is also nice.

Furthermore, I am impressed by just how *unhinged* some of the things in this story get. &gt;!An army of cannibal religious fanatics led by a 14 year old allegedly concived through necrophilia?!&lt; &gt;!Paran having to juggle an impending ascension to godhood, an impending apocalipse, and the fact that his dead girlfreind has been reincarnated as the pseudo-messiah to a horde of zombie cavemen?!&lt; &gt;!Zombie velociraptors with swords for arms?!&lt; This book is quite possibly the most Heavy Metal thing I have *ever* read. The best part is how it all holds together. Erikson is clearly not just 'throwing everything at a wall', the elements all *make sense*, more or less, once you have the full context. It kind of just... *works*. The individual elements are bizarre and absurd, but the whole picture is never ridiculous enough to threaten investment or break the serious tone.

The series is not 'over the top'. It is *exactly at* the top.",1625097723

Tell them you want to do a cash withdrawl, provide the denomination break down you want and they will put in a order with the local fed to deliver the cash to the bank.  Logistically, if you take out a million, hope you have a few suitcases.  If you are doing any more than that, you will probably need a pallet jack and delivery van/truck.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Everyone is of course entitled tot heir own opinions in this. I can see how someone might draw a parallel between humanoid races in fantasy like DND or Tolkien and races of people. 

In my personal opinion, this parallel fails when you consider that for decades and decades the community around dnd has made it very clear that human races and these ‚Äúraces‚Äù are distinct concepts. In the game of DND, there is no race like elves or orcs that are supposed to represent a human race of people like Africans or Indiginous peoples. Those kinds of humans are, well, humans in DND.

As for the way certain races are treated as evil or whatever, that is also not really the case. There‚Äôs a ton of DND and related fiction with sympathetic and intelligent orc or drow characters. If there is some racism here and there from certain authors or creators, that really got pushed aside a long time ago.

And to kind of sum up my personal take on this, I‚Äôd ask, ‚ÄúIn a fantasy or sci fi world, if I choose create intelligent, otherworldly villains that embody evil, like some scary aliens or dragons, orcs, if you decide that this means my narrative is really about a race of humans and based in racism, doesn‚Äôt that say more about you as a racist, than me?‚Äù 

Because I think that‚Äôs the real problem here. ‚ÄúA tall dark skinned human knight, and a silver colored elven archer with purple hair, and a burly red dwarf walk into the cave, and there they find a disgusting foul smelling ogre munching on the bones of the kissing hiker!‚Äù

‚ÄúUm so the ogre is supposed to be like black people or something, right? Racist‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo the dark skinned human is supposed to be like black people, the ogre is a mythological monster. You‚Äôre the racist you weirdo.‚Äù

I mean, when I say goblin, like a goblin from a fairy tale, are you really thinking about a human being that‚Äôs another race, not an evil monster? That‚Äôs weird. You‚Äôre the weird one.

But like I said, everybody is entitled to an opinion. If I wanted to play a game with some friends that took issue with that kind of thing, I‚Äôd make an effort to help set up a world more to their liking. It‚Äôs all about creating something with your friends and having fun after all.",1625097726

I have never heard of that and also he said the tune will wear my clutch down faster and that it was worn down already. Problem is my clutch was not slipping before and after the dealership. So I saw a video of a guy adding grease on the end of the slave cylinder and white lithium grease on the pivot bearing. So I took off my intercooler and did just than and in 20 minutes my squeak was gone. Now I definitely feel like they were just trying to sell me a clutch when I didn‚Äôt really need one.",1625097728

"DirtySnapchat","t5_2vuxw","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines here:
&gt;    https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format

This is what your title should look like:
&gt;    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
&gt;    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
&gt;    *[META] - Description*

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Old retired guy here...

True story about a would-be financial advisor which might be relevant.

This was many years ago.  I have a couple of insurance policies my mother took out on me when I was small.   One of them paid a cash dividend and it had accumulated a cash value of $1400 which I could take out as a loan at a very low rate - at the time, I believe it was 5%.  I got a call from the local office manager if VeryLargeInsurance Company with a proposal.  I would take the cash value from them as a loan.  Then I would invest it with them as an IRA.  I could then deduct the $1400 from my taxes.  The cash dividends from the policy would cover both the premiums of the policy and interest on the loan.  I could also deduct the interest on the loan from my taxes.

They promised me that the interest rate on the ira would be about 12-13% so, if I left it in there for 30 years, I would have a nice chunk of change to help with retirement.

This actually sounded like a good idea so I signed up for the deal.  

Now let me point out that I have a PhD in Mathematics and I was a professor at the local college.  My wife also was employed there.  We did not have much debt and we were making tentative investments in the stock market.

When the manager heard our employment situation, he suggested I turn over our savings to VeryLargeInsurance Company to invest.  Alarm bells went off because I had known this guy for less than a half hour and he didn't seem like the sharpest knife in the drawer.  I told him that we took all our financial advice from my father-in-law who was an experienced investor.  (That was true.)  

He then let go of this idea and he said, ""My daughter came home with a very tough math problem and even I couldn't figure it out.  Could you look at it and give me an idea about it.""

I knew some of the high schoolteachers and they had a calculus course there so I thought it must be one of those.  So I said OK I will look.

His very hard math problem:  ""What number is 16 forty percent of?""

I almost laughed as I told him ""40"".  

What the hell kind of person thinks they can be a financial advisor with being able to do elementary high school algebra?

Anyway, the IRA was not a great investment.  After 30 years with VeryLargeInsurance Company, we only cleared about $3000 from the IRA.  I steer clear of financial advisors.

TL,DR: A guy who wanted to be my financial advisor could not do high school math.  I don't trust any of them.",1625097728

"chadsriseup","t5_j941b","I guess you are trying to make a push/pull plan? Basically a plan where you focus on pushing excersises and focus chest, triceps, legs and shoulders and a pull routine on the other day where you focus on back, biceps and abs? If not then I suggest you try to make one like that or better yet get one from the internet.

Also always start with the most difficult and biggest compund excersises otherwise you wont have supporting muscles ready and dont have enough gas left in the tank to do them properly. For pulling that means back first, then biceps and then abs.

Also I suggest some bent over rows and maybe supermans to get all of your back muscles.

Also maybe get heavier weights if you can or move more slowly and control the weight more while training because the reps are quite high. But if you work out from home and dont have any weight there is little one can do.

I think the best thing you can do is look up some work out plans and look at all the muscles they target and subsitute out excersises for which you dont have the right equipment on hand.",1625097728

1. They self-deploy rather than being called up as a resource by the County
2. They encourage you to call their 24 hour emergency line directly rather than 911 (Otherwise they wouldn't get calls, as they're not associated with a Sheriff's Office, see point #1)

Basically what i an saying is if Fo4 added the ability to off kids it would generate controversy as well as a potential AO rating

*****
&gt; The conservative climate group KlimaUnion, which is made up of party members of the governing / alliance, has a position paper in which the members argue that Germany could become the world&amp;#039;s first industrialised country running on 100-percent renewable energy supply as early as 2030 and simultaneously reduce citizens&amp;#039; expenses on transport, heating and power use.

&gt; In the paper, KlimaUnion argues that Germany could save up to 63 billion euros in energy imports per year if it manages to achieve a complete transition to renewable energy, which could be turned into a &amp;quot;Growth booster&amp;quot; in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; Group member Wiebke Winter said the position paper should be seen as an &amp;quot;Argumentation aid&amp;quot; for the conservative / alliance&amp;#039;s election manifesto that offers &amp;quot;Concrete proposals&amp;quot; on starting to make Germany climate neutral already during the next legislative period until 2025.

Oh no, I hope the magical skyfather Odin accepts me into Valhalla at the end of my days, and that Santa Claus gives me extra presents at Christmas for being a good boy? What other fairytales do you believe in? And it's quite abhorrent that you think basic human rights were ""given"" by God, and that most likely the only reason you're even a ""good"" person if because you're afraid of burning in Hell for eternity, instead of just using basic human empathy as a guide like most people.

&gt; Regarding your history, yes Constantine was converted to the Church by a miracle

If you believe that Constantine was converted to Christianity by a miracle, I have a bridge in London to sell you.

&gt; My only question was which would you join--assuming you are a believer in dianetics--the scientologists being more or less acknowledged by all 50,000 Scientologist sects as being the Church of Scientology, or one of those 50,000 breakaways?

See, you only pose that binary question because you can't think outside the box, and think that it justifies belonging to a cult that traffics children and makes sure its members don't get in trouble for heinous crimes such as genocide and pedophilia, especially when there are so many other religions and also the absence of religion to choose from. The Catholic Church was operating facilities very recently in Canada, Ireland, and other places that killed scores of children and very much participated in cultural genocide of native children. By supporting the Catholic Church, and by extension their crimes, you're failing at your own golden rule of treating others as you wish to be treated. Maybe instead of praying and continuing to support an organization which has done more evil in the world than good, you could actually try and make a positive difference in the world, but I highly doubt you ever will, because it's your own illogical dogmatic religious beliefs that are stopping you from doing so.",1625097729

For obvious reasons, these are fake names. 

Jack and Jill started dating a few months before the end of year 11 (English high school - Jack was 16, Jill 15). During their relationship Jack sometimes asked Jill for explicit pictures. Obviously due to the age this is illegal, and Jill rightly dumped Jack after (in her words) ‚Äúhe wouldn‚Äôt stop asking‚Äù. 

For a week or two we told Jack he had been a bad boyfriend and was a dick for pushing people into sending photos. However, maybe two weeks after they broke up Jill got with Jack‚Äôs best friend, Joe. Joe, Jill and another friend we‚Äôll call Tom all kept bullying Jack. It got really nasty. It‚Äôs important to mention I am (well was) friends with everyone in this story. We found out Jack had gotten very upset to the point he had crippling social anxiety (he took the last 3 months off of school and issued his GCSE‚Äôs. The most important exams a high schooler has in England) where he couldn‚Äôt leave the house and had apparently hurt himself. 

Most of the year agreed this has gone too far and the three of them had taken it too far bullying someone this badly. We said they should stop but they refused. This has caused a rift in the year with everyone but a few of Jill‚Äôs friends hating the three of them. 

I told Tom my opinion of how it was petty and childish and had been taken too far. Jill then messaged me saying she didn‚Äôt want to be friends with someone who ‚Äúsupported sexual harassment‚Äù I said I get how Jack made her feel but that it had gone too far. All my friend group agrees except for Tom and Joe. The rest of the year also agree. 

Jill said the constant arguing has given her ‚Äústress and anxiety‚Äù so I replied ‚Äúlike you gave Jack?‚Äù Which was maybe a bit harsh since it wasn‚Äôt just her. 

AITA for calling out Jill and sort of defending jack?

I think it's really unfortunate that you think, or are just sensationalizing the idea of Giannis not knowing what an ice cube was. In addition to this, most of your other comments are things I already knew or could have figured out through a few google searches.

Giannis grew up in [Sepolia, Greece](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sepolia,+Athens+104+43,+Greece/@38.0028187,23.7154623,16.13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1a2d7c1768037:0x2600bd2df93b4a92!8m2!3d38.0045679!4d23.7160906). When looking at this place on Google Maps, I can't distinguish it from any other developed nation. Lots of cafes (with hundreds of google reviews), a bus route, train station, and even a 5 star hotel within walking distance. Somehow it's passable in the book that he has never seen an ice cube?

With the signs that you're sensationalizing his early life for marketing purposes, **my question is much involvement does Giannis have with this book?** Did his team reach out for a full piece? Who is getting the profits here? Most quality biographies I've read have the authors follow around the person for a period of a few years (see Steve Jobs, Robert Caro, 50 Cent, etc.).",1625097731

When I initially started studying for the DAT, I was a full-time student and working 0.5 FTE (was also volunteering on weekends and shadowing 2x a week!). I thought following Ari's study guide would help me designate like 4-5 hours to studying a day and keep me accountable, but it was WAY too much to handle. I quickly fell of schedule (like 3 days into it lol) and got so burnt out I literally didn't study for the next 3-3.5 months. I kept telling myself that I would start the next day, but I would lay in bed on my phone the second I got home and eventually fell asleep. I barely even did my school work. If you don't mind taking a gap year, I'd recommend studying over the summer while just working part time so you have one less responsibility, but if that's not possible for you, I would study for like 2 hours a day for like 3/4 months (?) That's kind of a random schedule that I picked but you should def adjust it to what your schedule allows. You don't want to be burnt out while studying or you will literally feel overworked and unmotivated like I did. I literally crammed the week before my test, because at that pt I was graduated and didn't have to focus on school.

"fidelityinvestments","t5_40w64h","Hello u/scottvf,  
  
Whenever (adj) appears next to an option position, the terms of that option contract have been changed from the original terms of standardized contracts. For example, the contract's deliverable (unit of trade) may be changed from the standard, which is 100 shares for options on stocks and Exchange Traded Funds, due to an underlying stock split, or a corporate action such as a take-over, merger, or special stock or cash distribution.  
  
For underlying stock splits, there are standard adjustments commonly made to strike prices and units of trade when necessary. For other types of underlying corporate actions, such as mergers, take-overs, spin-offs, and special distributions of cash and/or stock, adjustments fit the circumstances and terms of each action, and these vary from situation to situation. All options contracts are standardized and adjusted by the [Options Clearing Corporation](https://www.theocc.com/).

I still feel bad for the mom. I haven‚Äôt been in that situation on a plane, but I have in the middle of the grocery store.

She had never done anything like that before and it caught me totally off guard. 

Nothing I did or said would help, and I finally just had to let her scream it out of her system. I was so embarrassed and I knew everyone around me was probably judging me and thinking I was one of those lazy, terrible moms who dgaf. But there was simply no reasoning with her at that moment. So when I see situations like this, my go-to is to always sympathize first, before passing judgment.

But if little Timmy is running up and down the aisle, bopping people on their heads and snatching pretzels off their tray tables, and mom is sitting back playing Candy Crush Saga on her phone, oblivious to her little terror, then judge away lol. It‚Äôs justified.",1625097733

You said that you can control your drinking.
But further down you said once you start drinking you can‚Äôt stop and have negative results after with friends etc.

Ask yourself if you don‚Äôt have AUD then why would you ever drink? 
Bad shit happens when you drink and still you do it again.

It‚Äôs only now a year sober that I can look back with honesty at my relationship with alcohol.  

I had signs from the very start.  When you‚Äôre young you get get away with AUD because our culture normalizes binge drinking at college and young adulthood.

If you can not drink for 6 months or 2 months or 6 weeks then you can quit!!
The shame and regret I have for my behavior when drunk will never leave me.

But I‚Äôm glad because i need reminders on why alcohol is not my friend.

Sometimes I dream that I‚Äôm still in active AUD and I wake up and the crazy relief is overwhelming.

My whole adult life has been me isolating myself whenever I'm upset about something so I don't accidentally hurt someone with the things I say.

I go for therapy to slowly change the way I manage my emotions and my thoughts. I also have two dogs and they are teaching me to slowly be more patient and a better person.

They‚Äôll quickly associate that special treat with the specific command. But break down the training. Say you start with Look. First, show them the treat, let them smell it a second so they know it‚Äôs there but don‚Äôt let them have it. Say the word Look and if they even glance a split second in your direction, give them the treat and say YES!! Repeat, repeat, repeat.

Hillary's use of the non-governmental sever? technically Illegal, but not overly so, because nobody was prosecuted.  NO ONE. And say what you want about President Obama, he met with FBI director Comey twice in his 8 years in office, he wasn't pulling strings. 

Not that it matters because Clinton was cruising to victory, before the announcement of a new look at the emails and that was it for her.  She may not have gone to jail, but we all paid for that shit. 

What do you mean normal people other than Americans? In normal times Americans were the ones wringing their hands over things the rest of the world would be 'meh' about.  That's whats so dangerous about this virulent strain the GOP has taken on.  This is completely out of the American political character.  It's scary. 

And saying every politician abuses power is kind of a cop out, it's one of those things that designed to be like... they are all the same so.... what are you gonna do? 

What are we gonna do? NOT what trump did, NOT what the GOP is doing, and we need to hold people to account for ABUSES of power.

I also have a thing for sharing stories.  I know I'm going to have a lot of sex stories to tell if I've ever been around guys like this.  I never thought I'd be one of those women.

I'm not worried about him finding out.  He's not the type of guy that would ever care.  I know a lot of you are saying that's selfish.  But I'm not.  It makes me feel special.  I just want to hear what else he's like and how he's different from other guys.

And I know that most of you are going to say that it's selfish and you shouldn't be so open.  That's just what I need to hear.

I think a lot of guys are a bit of a selfish assholes.  I'm not going to tell my boyfriend I had sex with another man, but I'll tell him all about it.  It's just fun to know all the details of my sex life.  I like to give my bf a lot of details about my sexual past and I don't want him to feel left out.

Bumps were decreasing and my hyperpigmentation was lightening up a bit. 6 sessions definitely improved my skin. It‚Äôs still not entirely clear and perfect but it‚Äôs in the best condition it‚Äôs ever been and I‚Äôm not super insecure without makeup if I‚Äôm at the gym or the beach now lol.

But I have to try remember this, because it is what it is. 

Because you don't take meds to be productive. You take it to be functional. And functional people also have bad days.

But overall, the meds don't give you special powers, they give you what you need to function in this world, at this time. And sometime you need to take the meds just to relax a little, to get a feeling of peace. And that isn't just OK, that is necessary. 

You are not a machine, you are a human being and you need self love and to be comprehensive with your self.

So, try not to feel guilty. Because we also need not to be productive in a work way at all the time. I don't think that even meds can do that to us. We need to enjoy life. And if you feel with free time, maybe it's the best time to do that things you always wanted to do, but didn't feel with the time to do it.",1625097738

My wife was in an accident, and the at-fault insurance set up a rental with Hertz (I think, might have been Budget), to be picked up at the airport. We get there, and they've got no cars. If you've seen the Seinfeld episode about taking vs. holding a reservation, it was exactly like that. Zero cars available. None of the other places were open. This was on a Friday morning. We then went to the Enterprise office on Veterans, which had... no cars. Some were ""on their way from Atlanta,"" to arrive at We Don't Know O'clock. We finally ended up at White's Automotive, which is 50 Cent Rent-a-Car. They had cars, and if you don't mind one that smells like old cigarette smoke and drives like a golf cart with a dying battery, that's the place to go. But they were literally the only place in town we could find a rental. My wife still brings it up whenever we pass White's, and this was 2 years ago.

"learnpython","t5_2r8ot","Programming isn't my job, so take this with a grain of salt, but I'm pretty sure that you're worrying too much. Everyone knows that new developers can't program for shit. Even university graduates who spent 3 years studying software development can't program for shit, so nobody can reasonably expect anything from a self-taught programmer with 1 year of experience.

Admin may not be aware of this, but the (experienced) folks in the IT department most certainly are. Unless they're jerks, they should understand that it's their job to help you out, precisely because you're inexperienced.

So maybe this is too optimistic of me, but my advice would be this: Know your strengths, and know your weaknesses.

Your weaknesses are obvious: You don't know design patterns, you don't know the workflow, you (probably) don't know how important testing and documentation are, etc. It doesn't matter, just own it. Admit that you don't know. Be open-minded. Ask questions. Learn.

Next, what are your strengths? If nothing else, you have experience working in the field. You know exactly what those workers do every day, because you are (or were) one of them. You have already identified a repetitive part of the job that could be automated. Could the people in the IT department have done that? Probably not. Out of all the people in IT, you're the one who's the most familiar with the people who will use the software, and their workflows. You can help make the software as user-friendly as possible.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","Multidimensional IRT (MIRT) has enough differences from standard IRT that I would get a book on both basic IRT and MIRT. I have a copy of the MIRT book you mention, and think it's pretty good. 

For Bayesian IRT, Jean-Paul Fox has done a lot in that area. His articles are always good, so I'm sure [his book](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Item-Response-Modeling-Applications/dp/1441907416) is good. There's also a [Chapman and Hall book](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Psychometric-Modeling-Statistics-Behavioral/dp/0367737094/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/137-1921798-5076141?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0367737094&amp;pd_rd_r=0061fb28-4e89-4e03-89eb-e0060017c409&amp;pd_rd_w=IDweG&amp;pd_rd_wg=HI1Co&amp;pf_rd_p=fb1e266d-b690-4b4f-b71c-bd35e5395976&amp;pf_rd_r=DR9ZMZ4C8HVZ74SA2F94&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=DR9ZMZ4C8HVZ74SA2F94), which I think is... okay. I don't especially love it (something about the notation and formulas annoys me, but I can't put my finger on it). But it \*does\* have some substantial sections on Bayesian statistics before the sections on IRT, if you aren't familiar with Bayesian stuff.

You say you have Likert data -- that's often treated as ordinal, and you will find many different IRT models out there for ordinal data (partial credit, graded response, etc.). But in the case of \*actual\* Likert scales (e.g., strongly agree ... strongly disgree), you may want to look into unfolding IRT models instead, such as [GGUM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03195532). 

However, a GGUM is a slightly complicated model, and I'm not sure how easy it would be to implement a multidimensional version -- I think I've seen a dissertation or something from years ago, but I'm not 100% sure.

From a practical standpoint, most people tend to use standard ordinal models (e.g., graded response) for ""actual"" Likert data instead of GGUM, but a case can be made that for certain scales, things like graded response models aren't really appropriate, so you might want to be aware of it.",1625097739

You see, I have known of cis men who use *she/her* pronouns and I have known of cis women who use *he/him* pronouns, not because they are not cis, but because they wish to contribute to gender abolition, which they think shall happen by these contributions or at least trouble and disturb current, contemporary gender norms and gender roles for men and women in their society or culture.

These exact same men and women have been typical men and women in the way that they dress, talk, walk, look, behave, and do other things in their lives like have romantic and sexual relationships with their partners or spouses, but the only thing which makes them GNC, in their opinion and some others, it seems, is that they use the pronouns assigned to the other gender.

Come include strict chastity and never letting his cock out, while others incorporate chastity play only when away from each other and then lots of edgings to keep them even more horny and desperate. It's best to talk about what kind of experience he exactly wants. Most people would not chastity 24/7, so ask him when he likes being in chastity and when he doesn't. If he prefers being edged and  over and over and over and never allowed to cum or would he prefer ruined orgasms. As much as this is your decision, to better the experience for both of you, it's best to ask him what he enjoys the most. Also helps if you know certain words or phrases that could help trigger him into being horny and desperate at a whim! hehe",1625097740

My sister was married to two men who abused her. She felt responsible for making the mistake of marrying the first hubs and it was even WORSE when she did it the second time. Both of these men went through ""Honeymoon stages/periods"" where they can't do enough for the new women in their lives. It was almost as though a light bulb went out around 6 months after the marriage. I would love to know WHY women feel that they just can't leave, that if they leave they'll disappoint their families, and IMO, ""Who the fuck cares if they disappoint someone.""  Then too, many women continue to ""TRY"" and work it out because after being married 2x's I'm sure SW felt that she was a loser.  We really don't know the extend of CW's behaviors. Sure, we've all made comments that SW pussy whipped CW, but because we can't know everything because we didn't see what went on 24/7, there's a lot of room for speculation and at the end of the day that monster killed two little precious angels, their mom and the little baby brother they never got to meet.

Okay, you're looking on the peninsula which is a 17KM square piece of land. Where are you comparing to in BC? Because that would be like buying downtown Vancouver. How much is a 3 bedroom detached home in downtown Vancouver?   
For comparisons sake Vancouver (as in the city of) between UEL and Burnaby is 115KM square or about 10X the size of Halifax peninsula.   
Here is the cheapest place in Vancouver that I could find within a similar distance to downtown as the Halifax peninsula. https://www.realtor.ca/real-estate/23383849/427-glen-drive-vancouver  
It's been a house that has been converted into a town home, no yard really to speak of and is far shittier than the place you linked in Halifax. Sorry but your argument does not hold water. Property taxes are also $10k a year.  
There is no home in that 117km square of Vancouver proper that comes close to a house price here in Halifax.",1625097743

There's a big difference between knowing money is important and actively enjoying the money with it being a focus. It shouldn't be the focus here.

Especially seeing as she's mad at him- it would be wrong to just act like they're all cool now because he's making serious money. That's my point, that it doesn't and shouldn't solve issues involving emotions, and she should just be happy that he's happy with his job even if she doesn't care as much about success as he does. At the very least, and the most vital part, is empathy.

And I guess the extreme example of someone being a gold digger was especially poorly worded. I meant that more issues can arise, not that everyone who likes nice things is some kind of master manipulator out to get innocent rich men, lol. 

One of those issues is moving on from one insecurity or obsession to the next- if she becomes ok with it because he's successful, there's always the chance she spends his money like water or something as the issue isn't resolved but rather becomes another one. I've seen it happen before with jealous people- they go ""ok"" when it happens and believe they deserve a new possession as recompense.",1625097743

It's not a fire rated ceiling so it shouldn't be required, but I told him I'd do it to make HIS job easier. 

What gets me is he's saying my wires basically can't touch ANYTHING else above the ceiling. There are points where my wire is touching conduit or a duct here and there but I'm not using them for supports by any means. 

Does he have any basis for this or should I tell him to pound sand unless he can provide a code reference? I'll be the first to admit that I don't know everything, but I've never had this issue with an inspector. Thanks in advance",1625097743

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","Its cool to get a womans perspective on things from a guy that ""gets it"". I say this because I've been that guy in your post.

I'm single and casually date right now as a nondrinker and it's improved my life 100% on that end. Reason I'm saying this is I was in a realtionship where she didn't want to mother me, but love and support me. I continued to drink and she fell out of love. Basically I moved out and things ended. I needed to figure out things on my own in a healthy nondestructive way. Was the best thing for me (next to my Church and this awesome community). 

So that is one way to think about what outcome could happen if you decide to leave him, not every person pulls themselves up so there is that too. Or he really may need a little more support IF he can be honest about shit and own up to it and get stronger/help. If you love each other and he gets bis shit together, then relationship could be stronger than ever.

It's up to you to figure out how you feel about things because it's not one thing or the other.

Do you love him enough? 
You habe to ask yourself this and what you want. that's what it's about and no one like yourself is obligated to be in a relationship if you choose not to be. But if you love him and believe things can chanve then stay and support him without sacrificing your own sobriety or well being. I mean that.

Back in the day, in my case, I didn't have the character qualities that I do today and really get my shit together the way I needed to. Looking back I honestly respect her decision. 

Hugs over here lady. Take care of yourself.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","He isn‚Äôt a writer, sure, but those games work because they‚Äôre good video games. He led those teams and he obviously had input on the story and characters as it is a team effort. You can‚Äôt separate him from the good of those series. The problem arises when the ‚Äúbad‚Äù is solely placed on one person and then suddenly the ‚Äúgood‚Äù isn‚Äôt there anymore. In other words, you take the ‚Äúgood‚Äù and the ‚Äúbad.‚Äù The ending of Mass Effect is obviously not loved (personally I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad, rather quite the opposite), but that doesn‚Äôt erase the fact that that trilogy might be the greatest trilogy in video games, and arguably the best sci-fi related thing in the last 20 years. That‚Äôs a hell of a project to have on a resume and it‚Äôs on his resume. 

Also, I don‚Äôt claim to say that Hudson did everything on those series.  It‚Äôs obviously a collaborative effort. If Weeks, Karpyshyn, etc., would announce they too would be making a studio I would heap similar praise and hope for the best. Again, the problem here is you and others seem to want to strip Hudson from his greatest achievements. The fact is that he‚Äôs been a part of some of the greatest games ever (my personal game of the last decade is Mass Effect 2) and as I said, anyone with that kind of pedigree I will look forward to their games and hope for the best; since their ‚Äúbest‚Äù is one of the greatest in the industry.

 [Moral anti-realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism#Moral_anti-realism) 
 
 &gt;In the philosophy of ethics, moral anti-realism (or moral irrealism) is a meta-ethical doctrine that there are no objective moral values or normative facts. It is usually defined in opposition to moral realism, which holds that there are objective moral values, which any moral claim are either true or false. Specifically the moral anti-realist is committed to denying one of the following three statements:  The Semantic Thesis: Moral statements have meaning, they express propositions, or are the kind of things that can be true or false. The Alethic Thesis: Some moral propositions are true.

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&amp;nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&amp;nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","&gt; MP management

When was the last time your healers had to ask the BRD to play Mage's Ballad because they were running on fumes while trying to heal? Oh wait, that skill doesn't do that anymore.

When was the last time your mages had to use Mana Shift to transfer MP to the healers? Oh wait, that skill doesn't exist anymore.

When was the last time you put Piety melds onto your healers because they needed the MP regeneration? Oh wait, Piety is a trash stat that healers actively avoid.

When was the last time *anyone* ran out of MP unless there were large amounts of revives going out? It doesn't really happen.

&gt; Tank Stance

Deliverance? Gone. Sword Oath? Now a trait that is completely unrelated. Dark Side? Now a passive damage buff that most DRKs wouldn't even know the name of.

Shield Oath/Grit/Defiance? They're just threat toggles now.

&gt; Hard mode dungeons

The last hard mode dungeon we got was *checking* level 70. I actually had forgotten about Fractal/St. Moc (Hard) and had thought it was level 60 the last one we got. Regardless, level 80 dungeons are a joke.

&gt; DoTs

Fracture? Gone.

Scourge? Gone.

Salted Earth? Might as well be gone. Half the damage, half as often, for half as long. No blood generation.

Phlebotimize? Gone.

Miasma II? Gone.

SCH Miasma? Gone.

SCH Bane? Gone.

Shadowflare? Gone.

Aero III? Gone.

These are just the ones I know about on the classes I played at the time. I'm sure I've missed some.

&gt; Threat management

Yes, tanks still have to hit anything once to hold threat and do brain-dead easy tank swaps. But threat has been dumbed down to the point that it doesn't matter at all otherwise. My WAR auto-attacks for 47,000 threat per swing without crits. I'm not joking when I say that I can hold threat on a boss by throwing my axe at it and then auto-attacking.

Outside of that, we've lost threat combos, we've lost the option of a damage stance, meaning that now everything is a threat combo. We've lost any kind of party-based threat management. Quelling Strikes is gone, Diversion is gone, Ninja's threat meddling abilities are all gone, AoE provoke is gone.",1625097749

You are extrapolating from the correlation between salary and educational level, to ""education matters"". This is not necessarily true.

I think there's probably also a strong correlation between higher education and intelligence. Dumb people don't tend to go into higher education.

The data we're missing is on intelligent people (E.g. someone who could have completed a PhD) who didn't go into higher education (I don't know if it exists, I mean in the scope of this discussion).

Would they fare the same as the average person who doesn't go into higher education? I think they would probably fare a lot better in their career, despite not going into higher education.

Another possible explanation is that it's not the education itself which is valuable, but the stamp of approval your degree gives you.",1625097750

If you talk success as a straight numbers game, then no I wasn't really successful. I only baptized 4 people the whole 2 years, and one person I did a majority of the teaching for got baptized like a month after I got home. I learned something really important though that helps me cope with my ""lack"" of success. There are countless people learning the gospel in the spirit world every second. I have no doubt in my mind that the missionaries over there take those spirits to learn from the missionaries over here. My influence (hopefully) reached further than those 4 and a half people. 

I'd say over all I loved my mission. I loved a lot about it, anyway. There were definitely parts I hated, but perhaps most of the time I'm... indifferent to most of it? A lot of people asked when I was almost done if I wanted to stay or serve another two years if given the opportunity. My answer was a resounding no every time. I enjoyed what I did those 2 years and proud of my service, and that was enough. I've learned a lot about myself and about the gospel and I've carried those lessons with me to this day, but I hardly talk to anyone else who served there, I didn't marry a sister I served with, I don't go to the reunions anymore and I certainly haven't gone back to visit. Maybe I'll go someday with my kids when they're older, but for now I guess I'd just prefer to keep it in its own little bubble in time and just look back fondly at the good parts. 

TLDR; it was the best 2 years FOR my life, but not the best 2 years OF my life.",1625097750

Not really an inclusive bunch. And trash is still bad for the environment. Just because you don't litter in place doesn't mean it isn't going to be dumped somewhere in a landfill or the ocean. Using biodegradable soaps are generally ok if actually given time before hitting a water source which is why 200+' feet and buried is required. People are still buying plastic coolers and back packs and tents that will just be thrown into a landfill. They break glass and throw everything in the campfire. Not to mention the vast majority who only rough it outdoors but don't reflect any sustainable habits at home. Eating meat is even one of the number one causes of environmental degradation and yet me trying to be more responsible should have to be perfect? That's so ridiculous. Me using tiny amounts of biodegradable soap far from water does nothing compared to an rv camper polluting the air everywhere they go or an ultralighter using packaged dehydrated food.

Your boyfriends desires are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, in the sense that they are common. Several people would like to sleep with multiple people...he‚Äôs just one of the few verbalizing it up front.

Initially I suspected he was polyamorous, but I‚Äôm not sure if it qualifies if he just wants one night stands with various people. What he should have done was identify his desires waaayyy at the start. 

What are your current boundaries? If monogamy is the price he needs to pay to be with you, he has the choice of paying or leaving. If an open relationship is the price you would need to pay to be with him, then YOU have the choice of paying or leaving.

So ask yourself, because this really is about you, OP - what is it that you want? If you want monogamy (which doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt be attracted to other people, just that he would promise to not XYZ with them) , let him know that is the price of admission, and let him decide.

Such indexes are price weighted (if one stock is worth 100$/share and another is worth 10$/share, the index will hold 10x as much value in the first company). Index funds for such companies are exceedingly simple as it is just a list of stocks to purchase.


There are other ways to weight an index that make it more complicated. For example, you can use market cap instead of share price.

And then you have things like ""Total Stock Market Index"", which track the entire stock market.  It isn't always practical to actually buy a share in every public company, so estimations have to be used

What I'm searching for : this polo, in size L, with these colours (I know there are ones without the red, or in grey/yellow, but we love this shade of red). Available to delivery in France, or I'll commission you to deliver it to me. Preferably never worn but second hand is good also.
There is a jacket version of it, with a white collar, and a blue jacket with dark blue collar. I would be interested in those two also.
Please give me reasonable prices, because I saw it on Ebay for 250‚Ç¨, but that's more than I can afford...

Thanks a lot for reading, and maybe helping ! :)",1625097751

i want to say a poll/study concluded financial reasons are the top reason for divorce. that would make sense, it intersects personal autonomy and trust/cooperation.

seems unreasonable to assume that. correlation doesn't necessitate causality.

having kids can definitely be a emotional and financial strain, but it sounds like one they chose to accept. feeling responsible for things beyond your control isn't rational.

And I think a lot of what makes Unidentified good is the presumption from the viewers that the people all the show are credible and what they are saying should be taken seriously but both Lue and Mellon were working for TTSA when they show was filmed and Delonge was an executive producer.  Again TTSA is a for profit company.  So while Lue and Mellon bring a lot of credibility by being former government officials they were still working hand and hand with Delonge who's credibility on this subject is meh at best.  He's known for posting fakes and deleting them and he's made a lot of remarks that most just shake there head at.  

Lue could have gone this alone and told his story.  I mean I won't even get into the fact his story is only growing every interview as if he's trying to keep himself relevant.",1625097753

"HamRadio","t5_2r1db","Coax cable, similar to your cable or satellite cable, is used. For ham or CB it's just higher quality and made to carry transmit power. Cable and satellite coax is receive only, not as beefy.  If there's coax around with larger diameter male connectors on the ends it's probably for the radio and that antenna.  The radio should have 2 short runs of coax coming out, called pig tails, with connectors on the ends. Female ends I believe.  One is for an HF antenna (lower frequencies) and one for higher frequencies (vhf/uhf).  Maybe post a pic of the antenna for clarification. As for just listening, a length of wire from lowes, with a couple inches of insulation cut off, bare end inserted in the center of the round female connector on the pig tails will work.  Longer the better.  Fold that end a few times so its snug in the center hole but not so tight it causes damage to the connector.  You'll also need a power supply for the radio.  Pay close attention to red (positive) and black (negative) and connect to the same post on the power supply. Wrong way and it could fry the radio.  Just for listening, a 12v battery will work great. But again, positive to positive, negative to negative. So.....
Here's my suggestion: 1: Find or Google ft100d operating manual, download it and read it thoroughly. Same with the tuner  2: Google ham radio for dummies (it's a great starter reference) and get it.  3: youtube is your friend.  Look up simple short wave listening wire antennas, etc.  4: find a local amateur radio club and attend a meeting. Just tell them you're interested in short wave listening at this point. They should welcome you as a ""project"" üòÅ  4:  YouTube more about shortwave listening, the radio, the tuner, how to connect coax....anything.  Just take your time to take it all in.  This hobby is a blast!!!  Take care and good luck!  PS Although I was a CBer when young and around ham radio for years (thanks dad) I didnt get licensed until age 53.

Only 16% of Hindus have no restrictions on eating meat

  &gt; The whole beef issue has been unnecessarily polticized and is now just used as an excuse for violence against Muslims in India. 

Sorry but this is just ridiculous, Hindus have valued cows for a long time.

"OnePunchMan","t5_2vm97","There is kinda a debate about this. In Dbz the strongest human was either Krilin or Tien. Toriyama himself once claimed he thinks Krilin is the strongest, but Toriyama is also known for forgetting a lot of the stuff he established in his own series (like the character of launch stopped appearing in Z because Toriyama forgot she existed) and based on feats alone Tien seems way more impressive in Dragonball Z than Krilin, so some people argue that Toriyamas statement about Krilin was more because he forgot what Tien had don up to that point and he just never really thought about it properly.

However then Super came around and Roshi absolutely demolished Tien in that series(though he was powered by magic at that point) and had some extremely impressive feats. The series established that Roshi had been training again and that he had hid his power from everyone, thus there is now some debate if he didn't surpass both Krilin and Tien.

"LightningCollection","t5_23wx6r","I wouldn't go quite as far as to call LC junk but I wonder sometimes if some of the more defensive collectors have much experience outside of collecting Power Ranger figures in general. It'd explain at least some of it if they're comparing LC solely to Bandai of America's output as opposed to even Hasbro's other lines.

It's hard for me to look at the amount of QC issues this line in particular is having considering how much mold re-use so many of these figures have, while something out of Black Series (which is having problems of it's own) or Marvel Legends is the same price. SPD Green has three very different shades of green plastic from the lack of color matching with a mold that's almost all re-use at this point for the same price as Black Series Bo-Katan or Legends WandaVision Scarlet Witch. LC's put out some stellar figures, including the Tenga in wave 9, but the QC issues seem far higher than Hasbro's average.

And yeah, Super7's long production time is a blessing and a curse. While it'll take forever to actually see the first wave of figures in hand, my wallet might set itself on fire if they matched Hasbro's pace for releases.",1625097756

Obviously, I don't like generalizations, but some of the people in chat hold such high expectations and when he doesn't live up to those standards, they beat him down.

I mean he's already considerate enough waiting for 3 hours, had to postpone this vault already once before, helping out smaller crims, and paying for the laptops.

Any negative emotion that he exudes riles chat to either get angry at him for feeling that way, chat getting angry at someone else/chat or chat trying to cheer him up. They expect him to be positive 24/7 and with no other human emotion or else he's ""rude"".

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not sure who'll see this, or if it's already been said in response to you, but paid internships honestly suck too. In the UK, and most places in Europe, we have 'Apprenticeships' where you get paid -below minimum wage- to get a qualification and work a role where you're doing intern type work. Sure, it's paid, but how it works is that the apprenticeships are run through a local college and the government, and your workplace is paid a sum of money for taking on apprentices. Usually this amount is sizeable, at least 3-5x worth your apprenticeship salary which is, again, under minimum wage. 90% of the time, you will not be made permanent or receive a new contract, as the contract lasts as long as it takes to get the qualification, because they are literally using you just for that money. You don't get any benefits, it doesn't go toward your pension.

And from personal experience, screwing you is the intent. I did an apprenticeship for the NHS (the healthcare provider in the UK), and once all was said and done my manager told them she would never hire me again if she had the choice. I can now never work for the NHS, and the -whole point- of working for the NHS is 'you're set for life once you work there'.

And then second, a company wanted to hire me as an Admin Apprentice, but then got word they needed a new IT support (my desired career), so I got upgraded to an IT position with an IT apprenticeship...but they didn't change my contract to last the increased half year of the IT qualification. I never got a bad review, everyone loved me, but my manager didn't want me and tried to teach me nothing. I ended that year with no new knowledge, shit pay. But fortunately, the 'apprentice coach' who worked the qualification side of the apprenticeship managed to get me a special allowance to at least finish and earn it. It was heavily implied she almost couldn't.

Edit: Called my coach a couch.",1625097757

Yesterday I finished sharpening four chisels that will be used in the project.

If I had been drinking, I wouldn't have driven to get these materials.  I wouldn't have got this far in collecting the necessary tools.  I wouldn't have been able to afford any of it either.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 ---

 I'm being stubborn and having difficulty letting go of my anger at my brother's fiancee. The rest of the family is annoyed that I don't just ""let it go and move on"".

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Interesting questions, and good on you for asking them. 

  In regards to faith, I would say you do not have to fully, truly believe for your prayers to be effective. The fact that you‚Äôre *open* to them being effective is in and of itself, faith though! Plenty of people, myself included, have struggled with faith or belief. It‚Äôs not uncommon even among Catholics, for our faith to be brought into question. We keep trying. 

As for *how* to phrase your prayers, it may sound odd, but you might want to find a saint that speaks to you and ask for their intercession. They are often more *approachable* than praying directly to God, because they were human and struggled with the very same thing. St. Peter denied Jesus practically to his face, and is still venerated as our first Pope and a church father. They help ground our faith on Earth, so to speak. 

As for your ‚Äúsign‚Äù: I‚Äôd say be open minded. Sometimes the Holy Spirit is very subtle, and sometimes it hits you over the head with a 2x4. Although hey, maybe your ‚Äúsign‚Äù has already appeared, in the form of you taking interest in the church and coming here to ask this very question. üôÇ",1625097758

"thedavidpakmanshow","t5_30b6q","&gt;Running for office is being in politics, winning is being in office and being in politics.

Ok so I guess that we will just have to agree to disagree on yet another basic definition that you refuse to acknowledge the meaning of. Great. This conversation is literally one big joke, but only from your side. 

Politicians are paid representatives who have been elected to a position. Politicians are ‚Äúin politics.‚Äù People *running* for office *want* to be ‚Äúin politics,‚Äù but until they‚Äôve actually won a race and hold office, they‚Äôre not politicians and therefore not ‚Äúin politics.‚Äù Would you say that a football player trying out for the NFL is ‚Äúin professional sports‚Äù if he never makes an NFL team? Would you say that a singer trying to get a record deal is ‚Äúin the entertainment industry‚Äù if they never get paid a dime for their singing? Or would they just be aspiring to begin those things?

&gt;You also seem to think total wealth is the best comparison of wealth which is demonstrably false.

I don‚Äôt think that at all, and I haven‚Äôt said anything to make you think that. You‚Äôre just pulling stuff out of your ass to accuse me of now. One of the reasons why I don‚Äôt think Bernie is anywhere near as wealthy as a Kardashian is because of marketability. The Kardashians can make pretty much an unlimited amount money off of their image alone‚Äîat any point, any one of them can decide to be on another reality show or be a spokesperson for practically any product out there. They will never be poor/broke for that reason alone, even if they spend every dime they have today. The average American does not have that ability, and even as famous as he is, neither does Bernie. He can certainly make some money off speaking engagements and such, but he‚Äôs not marketable in the same way the Kardashians are.

&gt;But you can‚Äôt possibly think Bernie‚Äôs wealth is the same as the average American.

Again, I don‚Äôt think that and I haven‚Äôt said that, and you‚Äôre just making stuff up. This entire argument was based off whether Bernie‚Äôs wealth was CLOSER to a Kardashian‚Äôs or to most American‚Äôs. STOP MOVING THE GOALPOSTS!!!

&gt;How does this not make him a hypocrite when he‚Äôs the multimillionaire he‚Äôs fighting against?

So again, you refuse to answer my question‚Äîare the only people who can fight for anything people who are affected by whatever they‚Äôre fighting for?

&gt;Wealth inequality isn‚Äôt a disease.

Of course it is. The sooner you ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù stans realize that, the sooner we can be able to treat it.

&gt;It would be like me littering on the way home from a green peace rally. Hypocritical. 

Those aren‚Äôt the same things at all. What is Bernie supposed to do, NOT take a paycheck? Try to pass a bill through Congress *reducing* Congressional pay? Yeah, that bill would have a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell of getting passed. But littering is a choice, you can choose to do it or not.

&gt;I never would have voted for them in the first place so I certainly wouldn‚Äôt agree that they should be expanded.

Well, people didn‚Äôt vote for them, Congress did, because we live in a republic, not a democracy. But chances are if you were alive at the time of those programs being created, you would‚Äôve most definitely voted for the people who *did* vote for them. Because without the New Deal and the marginal tax rates being as high as they were in the 40s/50s/60s, you wouldn‚Äôt have either of the properties you have today, because you wouldn‚Äôt have any customers that need the service you provide in your job, so your job wouldn‚Äôt even exist. You would likely have started working in a dangerous factory somewhere when you were 10, making $0.07/hour and working 60+ hours/week until some younger kid came along that could make widgets faster than you. Then you‚Äôd be in line at the soup kitchen with all the other Americans in the same position as you. 

&gt;The original ACA? Really? A federal mandate to purchase a service and a punitive tax if you didn‚Äôt? I really can‚Äôt think of anything less American.

Really? So mandating people purchase car insurance and suspending their vehicle registration and/or driver‚Äôs license for not doing so is un-American too, right?

&gt;So of course Obama‚Äôs cabinet wanted it to be a stepping stone. 

It‚Äôs not just ‚ÄúObama‚Äôs cabinet‚Äù that wanted that, it‚Äôs a large part of the country.

&gt;The rest of us tax payers wanted to see it overturned in court.

Speak for yourself, not everyone feels the same. 

&gt;For the record money is not the only thing I care about, I also care about guns, and I like to use one to pay for the other.

Two things that are responsible for 99.9% of the misery in the world. I hate to judge you by that but‚Ä¶

&gt;Let‚Äôs talk about public services‚Ä¶

The wall of text that you followed that with was some of the most uneducated tripe I‚Äôve had to listen to since I divorced my ex-husband who used to try to force me to listen to Rush Limbaugh‚Äôs garbage white rage bitch fest every day. I mean, I get it‚Äîyou want YOUR money, and you want ALL of it, and you don‚Äôt want to share ANY of it ever. 

The problem with that‚Äîand everything you wrote to try to defend it‚Äîis that WE ALREADY TRIED IT. And guess what? IT DIDN‚ÄôT WORK. We were a rogue collection of uneducated colonies panning for gold and riding in carriages‚Äîand not on paved roads‚Äîwith a ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù that almost wiped itself out, until the passage of the 16th Amendment, after which saw the US dominate the majority of the 20th century and become the greatest superpower the world had ever seen. It wasn‚Äôt because of YOUR ideals for how government should work, it‚Äôs because of people like Bernie‚Äôs and my ideals for how government should work. 

&gt;Government involvement is to blame for the price of health care in this country just like it‚Äôs to blame for the price of college tuition. 

Actually, it‚Äôs the LACK of government involvement in the form of rules and regulations that is to blame for both of those things.

College tuition is an easy one‚Äîlet‚Äôs take a group of organizations, make them tax-exempt, put no cap on the cost of their services, and also allow them to make an absolutely unlimited income through sports programs that bring in literally BILLIONS per year but not require them to pay their ‚Äúworkers‚Äù (student athletes) a dime. It‚Äôs the same scam churches and televangelists get away with and why people like Kenneth Copeland have not one, but TWO, private jets, and why the shareholders of universities and religious institutions alike are absolutely rolling in the dough.

Healthcare is more far-reaching, because it affects everybody and not just students or church-goers, but it‚Äôs still the same basic cluster fuck: a group of organizations (insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, health technology companies, etc.) that have no cap on the cost of their services, with some of them even tax-exempt as well (like hospital systems). It makes for even better profits for anything to do with healthcare, because we‚Äôre talking about people‚Äôs lives at stake, and people tend to be willing to pay whatever to hang onto their lives, even if just for another day.

If you don‚Äôt believe any of this to be true‚Äîand I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt‚Äîjust look at both of those groups‚Äô profit margins, that will tell you everything you need to know. The profits of insurance companies has been soaring since the ACA‚Äîis that the ACA‚Äôs fault, or is it how the insurance companies used the ACA as an excuse for raising premiums and slashing people‚Äôs benefits year after year, knowing that idiots like you would cry ‚ÄúbUt oBaMaCaRe!‚Äù Same with colleges‚Äîall they have to do is sit back and collect their billions of tax-exempt dollars while some of you whine about ‚ÄúbUt fInAnCiAl AiD!‚Äù It‚Äôs the perfect business model.

&gt;I‚Äôm sure you expected you had me cornered on topic of public schools.

Because I do. Public schools are a social program. Social = socialism. If you approve of public schools, you can‚Äôt also believe any of the other crap you‚Äôre spewing because that would make you what you keep calling Bernie‚Äîa hypocrite. There‚Äôs nothing else to say on the matter.

&gt;We almost handled this pandemic right.

The numbers completely disagree with you. Until we were able to get rid of the disaster that was trump, the US was not doing anything right at all, and was in fact performing dead last IN THE WORLD in most areas. Most other developed countries paid their citizens MONTHLY to stay home, which in turn kept down the number of infected people and ultimately the number of deaths. They actually *listened* to the experts in infectious disease, and didn‚Äôt decide that during a pandemic was the best time to leave the WHO. Their leadership didn‚Äôt consist of people encouraging research into drinking bleach and blasting a virus *inside people‚Äôs bodies* with UV radiation. Many of them made mask-wearing in public mandatory.

The results speak for themselves: the unemployment numbers in the US were in the teens last year. We had nearly a quarter of the world‚Äôs deaths from COVID despite only having 4% of its population. Literally the only thing that saved us was the vaccine, most of which came from Pfizer and was NOT funded by trump‚Äôs stupid ‚Äúwarp speed‚Äù bullshit, and having a president now that actually took the virus seriously. You‚Äôre absolutely delusional if you think we even *almost* handled it right at any time before January 21st.

&gt;And there‚Äôs definitely no reason Bernie should be in charge of trying so spend another 6 or 7 trillion dollars this year.

And there‚Äôs definitely no reason why he shouldn‚Äôt be. Who is someone you think would do a better job of spending such a large amount of money?",1625097760

\[sorry for being flippant about such a nightmare. Humor is about the only coping mechanism for me.\]

When I was in grade school if anyone touched me by suprise I would flinch so hard I left the ground sometimes.

When I started dating it was hard to believe thst anyone would want me so I grew suspicious of those who were kind to me and because of that I've spent my life surrounded and narcs and the emotionally unavailable.

Sometimes it feels like I've never really felt truly loved even tho it's pretty much all I think about it. (my mom and sister are hard narcs. no care or concern for me. Not one time.)

The nextfuckinglevel of my dilemma is that I am also BiPolarII and many of those symptoms as very similar. Lack of self-worth, an intense desire to isolate just to name a few. And BPII is a motherfucker's motherfucker.",1625097763

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","So I work for a company that deals with Audioquest and they came out to do a demo for our ‚Äútraining day‚Äù. Our Klipsch rep came out too. So I‚Äôm in the camp of calling bullshit on AQ. I have a fair amount of their cables and honestly hear like no difference. I buy them cause I get them very, very cheap, and sometimes free (rewards points for our company using them). They demoed their 48gb HDMIs and some power cords (NRG Y) with a sound bar. I honestly heard a difference but it was a sound bar and HDMIs. But when I use any of their audio cables (Mackenzie RCAs, Big Sur RCAs, Golden Gate RCAs, NRG Y power cords, etc) I don‚Äôt hear any difference, at least in my system. For example those Mackenzie RCAs are like $250 and I got them for I think $20. No difference when moving up from Forest. It‚Äôs funny cause our Klipsch rep was talking shit on them ‚Äúuse fucking lamp cord, it doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù. The audioquest guys said it doesn‚Äôt make your equipment better, but brings out more of the potential of the product; which I think is fair. But some of the stuff they say on their products is kind of ridiculous. None of those buzz words make sense or can be measured with science. It‚Äôs definitely ‚ÄúI‚Äôve run out of things to buy in my system, so I‚Äôll spend money on cables‚Äù type of thing. I have by rocket 33 cables which retail for like $500 and I hear 0 difference compared to speaker wire. It‚Äôs wild. But I did honestly hear a difference with the HDMI for the sound bar, but I‚Äôll counter that with the fact it‚Äôs no where good enough of a difference to spend that kind of money on those cables. One of them was $2k. Just buy way better speakers. Always.",1625097763

I think you identify a lot of the problems with treating social sciences like hard sciences(memory, cognitive biases, etc), but miss the overarching point: there are just too many variables involved. Even if we could establish a correlation between protest and change, that wouldn't establish causation. Every situation with protest/non-protest and change/non-change had there own individual variables different from the others. I just don't think it's practical to parse out all those different circumstances to say no protest led to no change or whatever with any degree of certainty. I don't necessarily think this is a property of nature or anything, so for instance maybe a thousand years from now people will have no problem with establishing causation in these types of situations, but it's so far out of reach right now that it might as well be impossible.",1625097763

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","&gt;Golden age was during when dollar was pegged to gold. There was more innovation and growth during those times. People spend more time with art and innovation. Family bonding, mothers only take care of children and no need to go for work. Mother‚Äôs started to work when inflationary period started.

You just mixed up a whole different bucket of issues.

First of all, the US got off the gold standard in 1972,

But there was no sustained deflation in the US post WWII - 1972.

And, in fact, late 1940s was \*high\* inflation.

The Great Depression was a deflationary economy.

In that economy, cash was king and people who had cash had increasing purchasing power year over year until the deflation ended.

A deflationary economy is a slow growth economy.

Is a slow growth economy good for the environment?

Yes, potentially.

Is a slow growth economy good for wealth building and building a better life for those who aren't yet rich?

No.

So how do you create a society that is better for the world and doesn't trap those who are now in poverty at the poverty level forever?",1625097764

Still some of the best tasting meat I've ever eaten, though I'm sure there was a psychological component to hunting it, carrying it back to camp, cleaning it, and cooking it myself.

About 10 years ago, I was ‚Äúrecruited‚Äù multiple times for Vemma/Verve. The first time it was brand new to me. I got some free samples, thought ‚Äúall right, yes, this tastes fine, I‚Äôd pay 2 dollars a can before a night out.‚Äù My friend went through the spiel and invited me and the rest of the recruits to work under him. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhm, so we‚Äôd be sales reps and go to stores and bars to sell this? Or I‚Äôd be a sample girl? And you‚Äôd be my boss? Well Maybe, what are you paying?‚Äù Oh no no! I have to pay him $100 a month for a case of Verve that I give out as samples and I recruit other people who pay *me* for cases of Verve, and they recruit people who pay *them* and so forth. I was familiar with the term pyramid scheme but was always under the impression that a pyramid scheme had to lack a product. In that moment, I thought ‚ÄúI guess pyramid schemes can have products.‚Äù 

Every time after that, I showed up to a ‚Äúparty‚Äù or a ‚Äúconference,‚Äù saw it was a Vemma thing, and said ‚Äúyes ok give me your number I‚Äôll totally call you about it‚Äù while filling my purse with energy drinks because I didn‚Äôt mind the taste at all but you can‚Äôt just FUCKING BUY THEM.",1625097765

Yes it is. ""There has been a shooting, I was attacked"", you're alive and there's a guy with a bunch of extra holes = you're the shooter, you're claiming self defence, but you aren't claiming threat to life, you're just claiming battery.

 &gt; Just imagine you call 911, say you need the police but won‚Äôt say why, and they arrive to you with a freshly fired gun and a dead body nearby, and likely witnesses pointing to you as the shooter. That has nothing to do with tone-of-voice, it‚Äôs just weird behavior that a DA would love to bring up to sway a jury. Same with acting robotic and unfeeling after you‚Äôve just killed someone as they‚Äôre fighting to put you in prison.

That would be illegal to do. Your invocation of rights cannot be used against you. Your tone of voice or unfeeling behavior during cannot be used either. 

Even if it was possible to use in court, all it would do is prove you were in shock.

 &gt; Hell, even if there were zero witnesses, acting oblivious to what‚Äôs going on around you while there‚Äôs a dead body on the ground is the behavior of an unhinged person.

I don't know what's oblivious about invoking your rights. Being unhinged - perfectly justified in that situation btw - is not a crime.

 &gt; I cannot think of any scenario where that kind of behavior couldn‚Äôt hurt you in the long run ‚Äî as is consistent with the overwhelming majority of experienced expert recommendations in a post-defensive scenario ‚Äî but I won‚Äôt try to convince you otherwise.

The quickest way to a bigger butt is specific strength training with heavy weight that focuses on area in a caloric surplus. However, the most important thing in fitness is consistency. Try out a few classes and just do what you like the most. If you can do classes more days a week than you can do something more ‚Äúefficient‚Äù then it is a better solution for you.

However, if you view it as an opportunity for developing your ability to think and learn, school presents itself as an incredible opportunity to experiment and learn how to learn better and faster.  

Your ability to learn things well and fast will be of enormous value in any business career.  

Treat every class as an a/b test.  Start with note taking.  What method of note taking is most effective for you.  Find two methods. Test them.  Find a third and test that against the winner of the first round etc.  Do the same thing for writing papers, test taking etc.

You have the luxury of an ongoing laboratory where you can test ideas about how to learn with people teaching you things for free. Use it as a platform for developing your methods and skills to amplify your rate of learning and competency building.

Keep detailed notes about every experiment.  Turn your notes into a blog or book.

Use what you've learned about learning faster and build products/services that help people do that.  

In this age, our about to learn faster than everybody else is the key to success.",1625097769

"bitcoincashSV","t5_qzksz","CSW initially hid his ID wrt SN, then was 'outed' (by media) and reluctantly forced into confessing, then proving it to several key witnesses.

He then awkwardly and reluctantly tried to manage the attention this brought, and confused most of us.

However now, he's fukn owning it, and dropping the hammer on the pricks that made his life (and his family/ Co-woorkers/Associates.. et all) hell.

This judgement is just the start of dozens that will filter through the courts globally, establishing CSW as SN, and in parallel 'bitcoin' technology as his (and nChain's) intellectual property, via the 1000's of patents he has on it all. (what do think will happen then, to all the shitcoins?)

They made it impossible to just 'let sleeping dogs lie',... now CSW's awake and tearing it up. You'd do the same.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","&gt; Hi there. I've been getting back into the classic Fallouts lately and wanted to play through them again. Problem is, I no longer know which mods to use. According to some people I've talked to, Fixt and Killap's patch are no longer up to date, but what should I use instead? And is there anything like those two patches for Tactics

Hey.
The only alternative to FIXT that I can suggest using, is Fallout Et Tu. At least, in a comparative scale.
There are other unofficial patches, like Children patch, but nothing major as far as I can remember. Depending where you got your copy, you'll have to install Children patch (or something that comes with it, like RP) to bring children NPCs back (to be more precise, to turn them visible again).

killap's unofficial patch is for players that just wish to have a more stable F2, it fixes a boatload of bugs that the developers failed to squash.
There's an updated edition, which killaps has no involvement on. If you want to use it, click here:

Seriously, if you wanted to fly between locations, it would be more economical and less headache to buy multiple decent cars for each location and buy a modest plane, once you've gone through all the pilot training of course. And if you had enough money to do something like that, you probably could afford to hire a private pilot for less and not have to worry about that whole aspect of it.

The idea of ""drive / fly / drive"" has long been a 'that's cool' thing, but never has been practical.",1625097772

Ok so this happened a few months ago and I think I‚Äôm right but when I tell this story it has mixed reactions.

So I live in a city in Europe which has a large population density and barely any of the houses have proper gardens. I have a 9 month old hyperactive Labrador pup and we rely on the dog park just round the corner from our house.

On a normal day we pass the dog park and if there‚Äôs nobody in there we will go in and our dog gets to get all the excess exercise he needs. If there‚Äôs a lot of other dogs we won‚Äôt bring him in as he hasn‚Äôt got doggy manners yet and will charge at other dogs and owners demanding attention.

Recently when we walk past the dog park there‚Äôs a group of people who use the dog park to come together and smoke weed, then drop their roaches on the floor (weed is legal in our country) They don‚Äôt have a dog. We‚Äôve avoided them for many times and just took the dog on a different route but it isn‚Äôt ideal as we are in a heat wave right now and our pup can‚Äôt walk too far in the heat, so he relies on the dog park.

So it‚Äôs the 5th day of the heatwave and I need to get my dog to the park (it‚Äôs all shade) but these guys are there again. I know I can‚Äôt bring my dog in because the dog will jump on them as he‚Äôs not fully trained. I‚Äôm fed up. My dog needs to release his energy and I need to get him exercised safely. 

So this is the part where maybe I‚Äôm the asshole. I went in the front gate of the dog park and deliberately let him off leash so he would go up to them and annoy them. And he did that. One of the guys calls to me and says ‚Äòhey man control your dog‚Äô to which I say ‚Äòno, I don‚Äôt think I will, this is a dog park so you should be able to deal with the consequences‚Äô. The guys swore at us but left the park.

I‚Äôve told this story to my friends and they‚Äôve had varied opinions so I would like to know Reddit, AITA?

It would be like if I waited til the 3rd date to have sex, I would see them as a real person, and lose interest. I wanted that first 30 day honeymoon period over and over because it was SO GOOD.

domestically compostable ones don‚Äôt require washing and will degrade in landfill (and are made of recycled paper). and given that you have to wash a cup after you a coffee i can‚Äôt imagine that a refillable pod adds a non-negligible amount to the washing process. but even if those things did make a difference it might be offset if it turns out you only use half as much coffee and less energy.

no, i‚Äôm sure that the wired article isn‚Äôt a comprehensive, nasa-level treatise on the matter, but it‚Äôs the best summary of the evidence i‚Äôve found, cites reputable sources (academics not industry) and seems to makes sense. if you have better evidence to the contrary i‚Äôm genuinely interested to hear it (which was why i replied to the comment asserting pod manufacture to be energy intensive in the first place - thought they might have seen info i haven‚Äôt)

and obviously i‚Äôm not suggesting that single use coffee pods haven‚Äôt ever been a problem (i replied to a comment that stated a specific fact and then you replied to me), i‚Äôm just interested to know more about the relative impact of different methods of making coffee, and given that reusable/compostable pods are an option don‚Äôt think that they should be dismissed because non-compostables are not good. you wouldn‚Äôt suggest that take-out coffee is inherently flawed on the basis of the history of using single use cups, given that reusable cups are an option.

FWIW, I would absolutely 100% NOT tell your employer anything. Unless you get to a point where accommodations are beyond a doubt required to get your job done. In that case, be prepared for a lot of run around and challenges. Their idea of reasonable and yours are 2 totally different things. Not to mention, there are quite a lot of things they simply don't have to accommodate. And lastly, lots of people have lots of ideas about what MS is. You put yourself squarely in a position for discrimination by outing yourself. It's often extremely difficult to prove you were discriminated against so you will essentially have very little recourse. Why put yourself through all of that if you are managing your job duties? 

I'm coming from a position of experience on this, as I tried to get accommodations for myself and it failed miserably. Now my boss thinks I'm lazy and he knows I have MS. There are tons of things happening right now at work that are definitely discriminatory and he has threatened to put me on probation. I didn't get any accommodations approved, BTW. I spent 3 months ferrying forms back and forth from my neuro to HR with absolutely nothing actionable. I gave up after my neuro filled out a form that was nearly identical to the other one for the 3rd time. I'm definitely worse off for trying so I'm looking for a new job.",1625097778

Over the last 7ish months I've randomly gained A LOT of weight.. went from like a size 4 to nearly a 10 in some things.. and uo to a DD/DDD. Anyways. I had to sell most all of my lulu, and just decided to repurchase two Ebb To Street Crops, white &amp; black - size 8 (what I'm wearing above). Does this look like too much sideboob? I feel like it looks awkward on me now. If I go up to a 10 though, the waist will be super loose. It's already on the looser side, in this size. Or am I just more self conscious?



Thank you all so much for your input! I think im gonna send the black one back and keep the white for around the house bc it is super comfy.. but im just not loving the cut of the tank on my chest enough to keep two and wear out &amp; about in public lol yall are the best!

"mormon","t5_2qky2","&gt; Even if they can be fairly and personally chastised for their despicable comments, doing so is a form of being intolerant, no? 

You did read about the paradox of tolerance, right? The one this post is about?

The intolerant are intolerable. Someone who says, ""It's my sincerely held belief that left-handed people are evil and ruining the country, and we should put them all in forced labor camps"" has done plenty to actively reject the civility they would otherwise merit by default. They are dehumanizing others and expressing a desire to harm them. Some of those who express such beliefs may not actually have the intent to accomplish what they advocate for, but in a thread where nine commenters are *joking* about supporting Nazism (to use as an example an unfortunately all-too-common occurrence on the internet) and one is sincerely supporting it, the one feels emboldened and affirmed in that hateful ideology. And an impressionable bystander may well read and think, ""Wow, ten people all agree with the Nazis! Maybe there's something to it."" 

And the thing about Nazis and their ilk is that they have zero commitment to playing by the rules. They'll be civil when it suits them, but they actually do want to kill people like me. So while people are bending over backwards to not hurt their feelings, they're actively working towards killing me and many, many others. Nazis can't be debated with, and attempting to do so only legitimizes them and wastes everyone else's time and effort.

EDIT: I was pretty medicated when I wrote this, and although I stand by the general thrust of it, I did get slightly off-topic when I got distracted by Nazis. Nazism and related ideologies aren't totally irrelevant, as many DezNat proponents have pretty openly embraced fascist and white supremacist ideologies (e.g. JPBellum tweeted [the fourteen words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words)), but it's true that most of what would come up in a typical post on this sub is less extreme. Still, anyone who advocates for excluding people from legal rights and protections on the basis of inherent attributes is still doing real harm of the same kind, though not with the same intensity, as the Nazis. And in fact, the Nazis started out with smaller actions, only rising to the full extent of their atrocities once they had seized enough power.",1625097778

"rum","t5_2rg5e","Foursquare Empery

This is a rum from the Foursquare distillery  located in Barbados. It is a Pot/Column blend of rum aged for 14 years in ex-bourbon casks and and Pot/Column blend aged for 10 years in ex-bourbon then another 4 in ex sherry casks before being bottled.


**ABV:** 56%

**Nose:** Raisins, Raspberry, Toffee, Toasted Brown Sugar, Coconut, Nutmeg

**Palate:**  Medium oily mouthfeel, Raspberry, coconut, nutmeg, dark chocolate

**Finish:**  Medium length finish, oak, toffee, raisin, dark chocolate, nutmeg, black pepper


**Rating:** 5/10


This is fine, and I can see why people would enjoy this but this isn‚Äôt screaming amazing to me. It‚Äôs a touched over oaked, and I feel like the sherry aspect isn‚Äôt integrated as well as it could be. It‚Äôs still a well made rum, but doesn‚Äôt match up perfectly with my tastes. 

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out.

2 | Poor | I wouldn‚Äôt consume by choice.

3 | Bad | Multiple flaws.

4 | Sub-par | Not bad, but better exists.

5 | Good | Good, just fine.

6 | Very Good | A cut above.

7 | Great | Well above average

8 | Excellent | Really quite exceptional.

9 | Incredible | An all time favorite

Personally, I‚Äôm 35 right now and made $128K in 2020. According to that formula my NW should be around $450K.

And, as long as wealth is your most important desire in a partner, then love or anything else that may develop from the relationship afterwards will still be mostly superficial.

It'll be, 'we have similar interests...and he's wealthy.' Or, 'we have a deep understanding of each other...and he's wealthy.' 

But mainly, 'he's wealthy.'  And that's exactly what he's going to think, too.  That, at the core of your relationship, what you like most about him is his wealth.

I'm proposing that the national voting age should be dynamically decided based on the average age at which most of the population crosses the milestones I've mentioned.

This would mean that EVERYONE above the new voting age gets to vote... the milestones are only used for statistical analysis of the entire population to decide the voting age.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, regarding the literacy test idea... good point.

But my view is more about life experience than a learnable, testable skill. Add to this that I'm measuring that life experience based on averages of a group, and it means that lots of people who don't have said life experiences would still be allowed to vote.

The only practical difference is an older voting age... which represents a more sensible voting outcome.",1625097779

Their college stats were nearly identical, and Edwards had a very good rookie season.

He did discover some interesting stuff (which I forgot about). 

I also recall Edip saying something about RK claiming to get inspiration from God via Gaberial and Edip rejected it. But than again, I heard Edip accepting him as a massager (i think when he was talking to mufti abu layth). I guess he is being peer pressured or indecisive.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You're missing some important pieces of nuance.  Nuance is vital in navigating the troubling ecosystem of consumers buying from corporations who in turn lobby against our best interests.  It'd be great if things were as simple as you're painting them, because then there'd be an absolute right and an absolute wrong; wouldn't that be easy?

First off, the notion that gun manufacturers lobby to make firearms a wedge issue is patently false.  Gun manufacturers lobby to maximize shareholder value; part of ensuring that value means keeping guns legal so the manufacturers can generate revenue from the enormous US commercial market.  Having guns be a wedge issue is actually pretty precarious for gun manufacturers, because a swing in the wrong direction could cut off their revenue stream.  Gun manufacturers lobby for deregulation, because that's the outcome that secures the most value for their shareholders.

The NRA, which is an irredeemably shit organization (with troubling ties to Russia), spent a solid chunk of time with a relative monopoly on the firearms lobbying scene.  However, as noted, they're garbage.  Fortunately, their base of popularity is boomers, and they're dying in a hurry; the younger crowd of gun owners has substantial disdain for the NRA, many prominent sponsors / spokespeople for the NRA have withdrawn their support, and smaller grassroots gun rights organizations have gained prominence in the power vacuum as the NRA experiences a much-deserved from its prominent lobbying position.

Under the logic you've presented, it's impossible to ethically purchase a gun due to the fact that gun companies lobby, and those lobbyists donate to conservative politicians and organizations.  Under the same logic, you can't ethically purchase a car, or an internet subscription, or most of the items at your local grocery story.  Due to corporate consolidation and anti-competitive business practices, it's difficult to go a single day without doing business with a company that *doesn't* have a shitty lobbying track record.  Don't hate the player; hate the game.  The villain in this context is Citizens United; putting any semblance of blame on the consumer is a horrifically bad-faith sentiment.

With regards to the NRA in the 60s, it's worth noting that this was the era in which gun control was popularized *with* the NRA's support.  Modern gun control is based in California Governor Ronald Reagan's racist policies which sought to disarm Black people across California.  [Gun control is rooted in racism](https://yaliberty.org/news/gun-control-is-racist/), and [gun control itself is racist](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/story/2021-04-06/opinion-new-gun-control-laws-institutional-racism).  Gun control stands hand-in-hand with Marijuana prohibition as a wretched pillar of the carceral system that burdens marginalized communities with criminal records, and inhibits any possibility of upward mobility.",1625097782

"Christian","t5_2qjy5","Thought I'd share a post I made a while ago in response to a similar question.   


u/TroutFarms also has a really good response here, and it sounds like we'd mostly agree on this question.   


So here's what I've written before on God's omniscience (i.e. his being ""all knowing"") and omnipotence (i.e. his being ""all powerful""):   


**God's Omniscience**

 You're going to get several different answers here because Christians generally don't agree on how exactly free will fits into a broader Christian theology. Every system of Christian theology has to reconcile the fact that scripture affirms both God's omniscience and wisdom as well as human choice and moral responsibility. The two main schools of thought on this problem in philosophy are Compatibilism and Libertarianism, which are represented by Calvinism and Arminianism respectively. You can learn more on those just by doing some digging online, or if you prefer book recommendations I can give you plenty.  
  
I don't entirely agree with either of those approaches, however. I think one of the main problems with this approach is a failure to properly define 'omniscience'. It is almost universally accepted in theological circles that we have to define ""omnipotence"" carefully, or else we get into logical contradictions (and I'll talk more on omnipotence below), but many don't want to do the same for omniscience. In short, I would define a biblical omniscience as God knowing all things which are possible. This would rule out any knowledge with certainty about the future, however, since the future has not yet come to pass, and since human freedom makes certain things about the future indefinite. In fact, God often acknowledges this in scripture. Prophecies, for example, are often not given as definite outcomes, but as conditionals, because God doesn't know with certainty whether a people will repent or continue in sin (c.f. Jer 38:17-18).  
  
This view gets extremely complex, and I don't have room to go over all the nuances of it here. If you'd like more info, I'd be happy to provide it.  
  
**God's Omnipotence** 

This is less controversial than the first question you've asked. God's omnipotence is widely accepted as meaning that God can do all things which are possible, and that precludes doing things not logically possible (e.g. making a square circle, or a stone too heavy for him to lift, etc.). In the case of Satan, this doesn't necessarily mean God isn't powerful enough to kill Satan. However, it may mean that God does not have the power to kill Satan and remain a good, just God, or perhaps he is not able to kill Satan and protect the free will of all his creatures. There's really no straight and clear answer given in scripture, we can only speculate. Our best guess would have to be that God killing Satan outright in that way would jeopardize some other higher goal that God has, so that it's not logically possible to do both.",1625097783

When Diana died and people were acting as though the Queen should walk in sack cloth and ashes behind her casket this hypocrisy really bothered me and the present talk of reconciliation with people who have  thrown the Queen's family and institution under the bus gives me the same impression.

How many families do you know who do more than show up at the funeral of an ex? The Spencers weren't destitute and Diana's estate, flush as it was with her divorce settlement, could well afford to go get her and bury her themselves as would have happened with any family but the BRF. But no, there had to be a royal funeral so Harry can whine about taking part in it though he'd whine even more if she'd been buried by the Spencer's with much less decorum and his dad just making a polite appearance.

Alcohol is a big, dangerous, addictive, lie that is a huge drain on society and many people. There are many out there who are ""functioning"" and ""normal"" who know deep down they rely heavily on alcohol to make their life fun, relaxing, etc. and can't imagine letting it go. Let me tell you, life's way better without it. It doesn't take self-control, and you're not denying yourself. It's a paradox. You get freedom, clarity, health...not to mention you'll never have to worry about the many negative outcomes that can come from alcohol (DUIs, cheating, brain damage, fights, domestic issues, etc.). It's free, there are only benefits to literally every part of your life. It's the biggest life hack out there.

People who are familiar and close with each other can use self depreciating jokes to cope, that is between people within a closed circle. Do it with a stranger or someone not close to you, then you're just an asshole(and might get your ass beat.)

The whole point is that you're so close with the people around you that they understand you to not take issue with you and tell you to fuck off when you pull something that would otherwise be controversial, you can't do that shit with strangers. Often these internet wizards, who learn their social skills over the web, don't pick up on these social nuances, they keep regurgitating that sentiment as a blanket phrase.",1625097785

Both of which is something that Tumblr and Twitter would blow out of proportion, because of course they do.

All of this, however, was after he left the band for reasons still not known. Maybe it was the scrapping of whatever the 4th album was supposed to be - maybe Conventional Weapons - since he's credited on that.

Think about it, things have already changed within GME for the better, maybe not UNDENIABLY so (in MSM‚Äôs POV) but there have certainly been positive improvements.

"walkaway","t5_3l2gt","The Democratic Party started in the 1820s. Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians. Also, their opposition was the Whig party, which was against the Indian Removal Act and vowed to protect minorities against mob rule. Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery.  
  
(Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it's common knowledge that republicans are actually the racist ones.)  
  
Then the parties switched when the democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all democrats owned slaves, but nearly 100% of slaves were owned by democrats.  
  
As we know, the parties switched again when republicans repudiated slavery and democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.  
  
Then the parties switched again when a democrat assassinated republican Lincoln.  
  
After the civil war, the parties switched again during the reconstruction era, when republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.  
  
The parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people ü§î). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.  
  
Somewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.  
  
The parties switched again when republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which democrats fought fiercely against.  
  
The nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.  
  
The parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointmented the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.  
  
The parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.  
  
Then parties switched again when the democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.  
  
The parties switched when a democrat assassinated MLK.  
  
This brings us to modern times. The parties continue to switch all the time.  
  
The parties switched when democrats proposed racist policies like affirmative action to limit opportunities for certain racial groups in order to grant privilege to other racial groups.  
  
The parties switched when the Islamic fundamentalist Omar Mateen and several other ISIS mass shooters aligned themselves with democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  
  
The parties switched again when liberal student groups in schools like UCLA and Berkeley call for segregated housing to make ""separate but equal"" housing quarters for black students. Actually this is a current ongoing thing, so the parties are right now in the middle of switching on this topic.  
  
Parties always switched currently now that democrats are rioting and violently protesting democracy.  
  
So as you can see, because of Party switching, democrats were always the ones who stood up against racism and wanted peace and unity while republicans were always the racist and violent ones calling for division and discord.",1625097786

"korea","t5_2qiog","I think Roh's astounding increase cannot possibly be replicated in current Seoul. Lee had global economics working for him in terns of price stablisation and was far better at dealing with current economic matters than most Korean presidents.

I agree a lot of Moon's real estate policies are haphazardly applied and thought out. It's looking lile he will destroy Roh Moon Hyun's legacy in Sejong with the new scandal of basically awarding government employees cheap apartments. The LH scandal will also bear poorly on Moon's legacy.

My hope is that the mayor of Seoul can fix things, especially if he is re elected with more conservative support. 

However I do think Seoul is running out of room to easily build. I'm not sure about the less parking idea, that's already a problem, or greater density, as Seoul is already incredibly dense. I do laugh at the people who think the solution is to move out of Seoul. Yup, we can also take it one step further and move to Northern Canada where buildings igloos is free and only takes a few hours.

The next president won't have it as easy as Roh Taewoo, that's for sure. Also conditions will change and 100% increases in 4 years can't keep up forever because that will put Korea at No.1 in terms of affordability soon. Maybe global economics will shift in favor of cheaper home prices. I guess then we will have owners complaining about that. I know I won't mind.",1625097787

Most dildos on display at adult stores are too big to begin with. 

I find that the process of cleaning will tend to relax and dilate me a little. After the second flush, when I should be more or less clean, I can easily dip two fingers, then three, then my dildo (I use a King Cock 7"" tapered, but maybe start smaller).

All I'm saying is that you can't physically sense time dilation occurring unless observing both inertial reference frames (of the event, and the observer) from your own inertial reference frame. This is because consciousness isn't independent from the body; if you *were* to take consciousness to be constant and intangible, it would be the same as observing from a 3rd inertial reference frame. But since consciousness *is* physical, any slowing of time would slow the movement of the physical processes in your brain such that your consciousness would exist at that dilated time, therefore meaning you can't detect that time is relativistically dilated.",1625097788

It's sad because it had a nice SS before they issued more shares for it.  Alpharidge lost a lost of confidence from their investors for bailing on this one as they did.

At this point it's not looking good, but there is a small chance of hope for some sort of rebound if they can get current.

"EnglishLearning","t5_2u8ap","Speaking from experience as a long-time learner and short-time teacher, I can say that out of the 4 main language skills (speaking, listening, writing, reading), the passive ones (listening and reading) are almost always easier to learn. I'm not gonna say that one of them is easier than the other, because that depends on each learner's skills, aversion and interest (some hate reading, some love it, for example). Basically, understanding English is usually far easier than expressing yourself in English.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for your question about writing vs speaking, there could be several reasons: in most schools, the main focus is grammar so there's a lot of sentence-writing, composing, and an essay every now and then. Giving presentations (speaking about something with your own words) is quite rare, to be honest. Personally, I loved and still love English, but I wasn't actually ""forced"" to speak about something English before my University years (sure, the teacher would ask us questions and such, but more often than not, the answers were either short or already given - in the question itself, or in the schoolbook).

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason - and I think it's the main one - is people's adversity for actual conversations, and more to the point, the fear of embarrassing themselves by saying something wrong. In writing, typos aren't seen as such a big deal, nor do they have immediate consequences (usually it takes a while for the teacher to grade the papers). In conversations however, the reaction would be instantaneous and obvious, so if the speaker says something wrong it will be noted immediately (and while the conversation partner might not say anything about it, their reaction would be telling enough to make the speaker feel at least a bit embarrassed).",1625097789

In theory, just about anything is possible for mutation. In practice, the degree of mutation required for COVID-19 to re-engineer itself into almost an entirely different category of viruses is exceptionally low. As a result, the answer to your question would be that virus viability on surfaces could vary (to a very small magnitude) between variants, but that there would likely need to be significant changes to see an increase in surface viability which is beyond what would be expected in a typical viral variant.",1625097789

And those aren't necessarily bad skills for fantasy writers -- assuming you'd want to put into a lot of things people know (with a twist) and sprinkle a few originals on top. Very often being the person that can consistently produce (anything between really good to ""could do better"") is definitely traits and skills necessary for a line of work. Even as a programmer or engineer, these things are valued. I'm pretty sure even in fantasy; things, people, skills, abilities and ""physical limitations"" play a huge role, and even more important, the author has a firm grasp of his own world rules -- and wont resort to gimmicks and bailouts.

What I am looking for, though is someone who is both capable and willing to do as much of the work as I do, and share the chores with me. 

I recently ended a seven almost eight year relationship where I did all the cooking, all the finances, shopping, mostly all the cleaning. She could hardly call for a doctors appointment on her own. So the last thing I want to do, is be like that, and ask someone else to all the work.

That said, the wars in Afganistan and Iraq went on for many years and civilian deaths are avoided, but still do happen frequently. 

I have no doubt some poor guy, somewhere during these conflicts, was digging a hole to take a crap on the roadside and got a high explosive enema. 

During WWII the Allies and Germans sent waves of heavy bombers to target whole cities. 

Entire cities on both sides were bombed into rubble. 

Even worse was when the allies used firebombing against the Japanese when the population live in highly flammable, closely populated areas. 

The city centers were targeted so the raging inferno would draw oxygen and create gale force winds in the streets to hinder firefighting and make hell on Earth. 

More people perished in the firebombing than the atomic bombs.

They had to temporarily forward their mail to us until USPS (or the city, or whoever makes the decision) got out there and told them where to put a mailbox. THEN they could go out and buy one to install themselves. 

Biggest issue is their address is similar to another one across town, so they still can‚Äôt get the city to recognize that their house exists.

"UnethicalLifeProTips","t5_3cx36","The best advice we could give correlates with how much info you can give us on this. What's your relationship with your boss/manager (do you guys like each other)? How long have you been working there? How integral are you to the company? Is this the first time you've had to do this, if not, how often? Are there ways you can come back and say you're working on being better and have physical evidence (like that you've made appointments with psychiatrists or psychologists) to guarantee that you're working on a solution and not just saying ""sorry this won't happen again"". Because if you only verbally show your remorse it's a lot less credible than an apology with proof and better yet, future plans after getting mental help to guarantee this won't be a pattern. Remember it's not just you being affected by this, your bosses and perhaps coworkers as well could be taking a hit from their reputation or amount of work you missed. 

I had moments like this at a job I used to have with very understanding managers luckily. The bottom line is, if you tell the truth (or give a lie that is 100% unverifiable on a sensitive topic they might be too uncomfortable to pry for more info on) and explain how you're going to do better and have already taken steps in the direction to do just that, chances are you'll come out alright.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

**1. Use only M, F, T, TF, or TM for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4F]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or #**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagor4r/submit?sidebar&amp;amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to message the moderators.

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"FORTnITE","t5_2t7hh","**Head Clipper** is a very good spear for it's high damage, moderate knockback, base critical hit chance, and heavy attack.    
This weapon is great for killing smaller targets easily in a few swings or less, with it's heavy attack you can easily clear crowds of husks and knockback surviving targets with the whirlwind attack, and deals moderate damage and impact to bigger targets.  
**Head Clipper** is the Scavenger variant of the base-game spear, **Whirling Doom** , meaning it has less durability, cheaper to craft, and very similar stats to it's base-game variant.  
  
The downsides of this weapon is that it has a slow attack speed, which can be fixed by including a attack speed perk.  
The best perks for the **Head Clipper** are: (AS or CR), (HAE or Armor or Dmg), Element, (AS or CD), DmgToConditional, (Affliction, Snare, Stacking Damage, or Stacking Critical Rating)

\*If you want to mainly do a damage build, then you can replace the critical rating with damage and critical damage with damage or headshot damage(Ranged Weapon only)

  
\*\*If you want to mainly do a critical damage build, then you can replace a damage perk with critical rating and any damage perks with critical damage perks.

  
\*\*\*If you are using a Totally Rocking Out hero build or a hero that increases critical rating of that weapon, then you can use as much critical damage perks that the weapon can have.",1625097793

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Yes, Ovechkin will sig with the Caps after the expansion draft. I would not be surprised if Seattle took advantage of the 48 hours prior to the draft to try to convince him to sign there, but he is deeply invested in the Caps and the DC area and has quite openly said that he wants to finish his NHL career in DC before going back to finish his playing career with Dynamo Moscow. Knowing this, both he and the Caps likely already have a deal at least tentatively in place or close to being finished, but that will not be signed until after the expansion draft, allowing the Caps to protect another player that is under contract next year.

To me, the only thing up in the air about the Ovi situation in DC is what the terms of his deal will be. Im imagining that it will be somewhere between a 3 and 5 year deal, but I personally think it will be fore less than most people expect. Ovechkin wants to win and wants to break Gretzky's goal record. Taking slightly less than he could demand will allow the Caps a little more Cap space, and what he would lose out on in money he would make back in the Caps being able to afford to spend more on the players around him.

Regardless of the terms, however, I think that after the contract is done, unless he is VERY close to 99's record, he will retire from the NHL and move to the KHL. I think Backstrom and Oshie will retire around the same time and that the Caps will then try and move some older players and go into rebuild mode around their youngest members.",1625097793

"roadtrip","t5_2r413","If the Canadian side is open- gas is about $6 CAD per gallon in BC, probably closer to $5 in AB. It'll swing along those lines, possibly go higher. 

Finding camping spots is near impossible but worth looking at Google Maps and finding campgrounds/looking at websites. Seems you can random camp on crown land but don't take my word for it. Fire bans are already coming into place but it's not uncommon for gas pits/stoves to be allowed. 

If you are in the Rockies late Aug/early Sept come prepared. The weather can do weird things. 

That drive from Banff to Van is stunning. You can take a different route and ferry across a lake in the Okanagan (definitely do this if the weather is sketchy). Wine country is stunning. If you or anyone you know drinks wine- grab some. Lots of 'natural' wine production and stuff I can't even get on the island (Anthony Buchanan and Daydreamer are amazing!).

BC is dropping the mask mandate tomorrow but keeping masks as strongly recommended. Some places may still require them. AB is a whole other ball of wax but Banff may have places it's required. 

Fair warning- some folks aren't super into vacationers from other provinces, let alone countries quite yet. Maybe it'll be fine by then but maybe not. 

Eat some poutine. Try the weird chips- dill pickle &amp; all dressed especially. Enjoy the microproducers in BC. Hit farmers markets. It's a beautiful time of year.",1625097793

"voroncorexy","t5_3e8gi","If you have an enclosure then you should be able to use cooling.  If your chamber temps are ~35-45¬∞C I'd keep it pretty low.  Higher chamber temps allow for higher fan speeds without issues.  The optimal fan speeds will depend a lot on what fans and what ducts you're using, you'll need to play with it to figure what's best for your setup.


My switchwire enclosure hits ~53¬∞C and I usually run my 5015 AB-BN 30 toolhead at ~20% and I have no issues.  My v0.1 enclosure hits around 60¬∞C and I use about 40% on it, 3010 fans blow a lot less air though so that's why it's so much higher.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

He spoke of Bella like she was an object with no free will or capability. It just got on my nerves throughout the whole book. That, and the fact that Ed just said the same thing over and over and OVER again. ""She's gonna run and scream....okay she didn't."" ""NOW she's gonna run and scream....nevermind.""

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Since others here are missing the point, I'll ask the obvious: Why is it more believable than not to you that someone actually witnessed a miracle in *any* given case, including this one? Why, for example, when lying is far more common than actual miracles, is it not more likely and thus more plausible that the gospel is an example of a lie?

I know that multiple people all giving the same lie seems unlikely, unless it is a coordinated conspiracy or a collective misinterpretation and misrepresentation of events. But disregarding this latter option, I still just don't think there's good enough evidence from eyewitness testimony to overrule the other eyewitnesses alleged in that very testimony who did not confirm the story. For example, there were supposedly witnesses to the Lazarus resurrection, as well as every other miracle, but those witnesses were not among the earliest disciples after Jesus' death. If they did not believe the ""miracles"" were sufficient evidence, why should we? That the Jewish religion still exists is the greatest testimony against the historical truth of Christianity for me.",1625097795

The last dates that he actually gave were in his last book on the pyramid timeline. This does not state things will change suddenly like a mass ascension but just that there would be dates when things more forward around the next 100 years or so.

Like a lot of his work the pyramid timeline is very well researched. I realise he went off the rails with Corey and Emory, but, in my opinion he is very diligent in sourcing the statements he expects you to believe in his more recent work.

In my opinion a good explanation of some of what will happen in our future comes from a system called ""The Human Design Chart"". I have also had dreams about seeing auras, and that ability has become massively stronger for me recently, and friends of mine having experiences that directly oppose their insecurities.

Among the experiences that I support and want from the world, is the ending of 'the loneliness epidemic'. I think this is natural after a revolutionary experience. I want the reduction of money as a detrimental factor in peoples lives and a reversing of the low child birth that we have seen over the past few years.

TL;DR: 8.5/10, Lorem (and Ipsum too, of course!) were a real pleasant surprise to hang out with, even if you couldn't date them in the traditional sense.

Lorem and Ipsum were definitely amazing characters (like everyone else in this masterpiece of a game), even though they didn't feel as attached to the story like everyone else did. Originally, Lorem was going to be my first character that I would focus on, but then Remy happened, so I did them second. And what fun that was!

After the cute exchange that was delivering the mail, I felt like I could bond with Lorem the same way one would bond with an old friend, so that already made me quite interested in them. Their ""dates"" were really enjoyable in the sense that it was just some chatting about life and how things worked in the world of the dragons.

Date 1 felt a bit out of place, just like Lorem themselves feel within the flow of the story, but I didn't mind. The part where we just started to talk about human myths was interesting, because I always wanted to know more about how the dragons perceived humans (something I wish was more elaborated on in the other parts of the game). And don't get me started on Lorem being an aspiring game developer! That just always stuck with me for some reason, and I love it. Mix those scenes with an amazing track like Fountain, and you get the perfect ""vibing with friends"" feel!

Date 2 was amazing for one reason alone: Ipsum. Ipsum is one of my favourite side characters in the game, and how he just starts to talk about &gt;!quantum physics and how teleportation works with a few theories of his own!&lt; was an experience on its own, for sure! A classic M. B. Saunders move, subverting my expectations like that! I dunno, Ipsum just feels like the perfect companion for someone like Lorem.

Date 3 hit close to home for me, because it reminded me about how I always used to go &gt;!treasure hunting!&lt; with my friends back when I was a kid. To have a day like that with someone like Lorem was like reliving the better times of my childhood (damn, I sound like a boomer now, don't I), even if &gt;!the treasure hunt was unsuccessful.!&lt; Guess the real treasure was the &gt;!expired pizza coupons!&lt; we made along the way.

I will admit, date 4 did have a big effect on me and how I view the world now. The speech with Lorem about &gt;!being anxious about what others will think of you and your projects!&lt; made me lay down on the floor and basically rethink my entire life up until that point. I always struggled (and still do) about what others will think of me when I do literally anything, and to hear those words and the responses from the MC were basically weaponized showerthoughts aimed at me. Now, for Lorem's big reveal. It did feel a bit sudden considering we knew each other for basically a few weeks, but whatever, I guess. Regardless, it's inspiring to see Lorem revealing their biggest secret of &gt;!being intersex!&lt; to someone they haven't known for a long time regardless of what potential backlash they might get.

Now for the endings. Lorem's endings weren't as depressing as the others, which I'm glad for. Their bad ending is simply &gt;!them dying (not that it's a good thing, mind you) from being kicked by Reza!&lt; and their good ending is &gt;! them saving the dragons by warning everyone of the comet (What, an actual somewhat good ending?!).!&lt;

Oh, and on a side note. Lorem has the best soundtrack of any character. All their tracks fit perfectly in their dates and conveys the perfect emotion at the perfect time. Just. Beautiful. \[Inserts Chef's Kiss\]

Now, question time!

&gt;Lorem is introduced as a post office worker, but this surprisingly doesn't factor much in their character. Do you think they could be better tied to the plot through their job?

I do wish that Lorem did appear more as a post office worker. Maybe that could have caused a closer relationship between them and the other characters, or maybe even tie more in to the plot, like delivering letters to the MC instead of having the answering machine. Also, that postman outfit is just so cute! Oh well, curse of being the backer character late into development, I guess.

&gt;Ipsum works for Anna, but he also pursues intellectual interests during his free time, going as far as correctly presuming how the portal works. Would you like Ipsum to have had more development, or was his scientific talk too much for you?

More screen time for Ipsum would have been amazing! I feel like there was quite a lot of potential lost with how we got to see him in the game. Maybe us seeing him working for Anna would be just what was needed for him.

&gt;Were you disappointed at the lack of romance?

Not at all! In fact, I think it was perfect that there was an option to just hang out with someone without having a romance option. It probably gave Lorem a lot more freedom in terms of character development.

&gt;Did you find the Ixomen Sphere parts without resorting to a guide?

I wish...

&gt;What do you hope to see about them when they get featured in Angels with Broken Hearts?

Maybe a bit of backstory about how Lorem and Ipsum grew so close to each other, or a bit more about their jobs. There is a lot of possibilities there to be honest!

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion: Lorem and Ipsum definitely stood out the most with a lot of memorable moments, both full of nostalgia and self-reflection. Also, amazing music! I'm really excited for when they appear in AwBH and how they are going to interact with the world pre-AwSW.",1625097799

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","Not everyone has the luxury of being able to change jobs readily. And still others really stick around expecting things to get better at some variable or uncertain point in the future. I am almost 50 years old, I have never seen a lower unemployment rate in my lifetime or a more rapidly expanding economy. The last year or so of Clinton's presidency was a close second, but I think there are more opportunities now. 

So I would say that anybody dealing with a truly toxic workplace should gtfo now while the getting is good and you can easily explain away your reasons for leaving without lying or trash-talking the place which is never a good look.

If someone is in that second group that is resistant to leave I would say to get some very concrete dates and time frames when conditions will change and get it in writing. If it is more than a year or two out on the horizon then gtfo anyway because they will find a way to change that, too. 

And finally, if you really need to play whatever is bothering you close to the vest there is no chance that things are going to ever improve unless you are a professional gambler or a spy or something. If people take your legitimate efforts to communicate about areas of concern and twist them into a way to irritate you or chase you out then I would let them win and, yep, gtfo. Their prize is they get to be dicks to somebody else and you get to walk free.

First, I'd take a step backwards and ask you what gave you purpose as a Mormon. Was it serving God? Do you imagine that an all knowing and all powerful deity actually needs your service? Is there anything that you can do for God that God cannot do better all on his/her/its own without your help?

Presumably, you'll come to the conclusion that God never needed your help to do anything in the first place.

Now, go forth and find your own purpose in life. What is it that you want to do for you?

For my wife and myself, in addition to our love of each other over the last 34 years, we love going out into nature and watching wildlife in their natural habitat. We love that feeling of oneness with all life on this planet based on our shared evolutionary history and our relationship to each other.

We especially love when we can watch undisturbed behavior of the various species we're fortunate enough to see.

So, as a free adult, take responsibility for your own life and find your own purpose. It's liberating and freeing. It feels wonderful.

Enjoy some of the grandeur of the universe knowing that this is all their is and appreciating its beauty for what it is, rather than thinking of it as a mere toy for the amusement of some imagined deity.

All the best to you and welcome to reality.",1625097801

I think your brain gave you a false a attraction and then bam, anxiety kicks in so you acted irrationally.

However, because of the extreme stigma, there would be few willing to acknowledge if they've seen something strange which would suppress acknowledging and systematically collecting the data. On top of that, if you believe certain sorts, evidence may have been destroyed. Hell, even if you don't go through the thinking of a conspiracy to actively destroy evidence, evidence of anything quickly vanishes if not quickly preserved or if improperly preserved. That's a whole thing with many criminal cases. People misremember and forget things, items get lost or degrade over time, stuff  could be preserved improperly, etc.",1625097801

this gets paired by Ais suspicions about her teacher being confirmed as purely in her head, leading to a potential takeaway that we should not trust girls who are dealing with trauma. based on the earlier episodes, it may not be the message the author wanted us to take away, but it's easy to see how it's the message people some people could come away with.",1625097802

I don't want to tell you too much, other than don't watch the Nintendo switch trailer, because it gives away too much. Everything about the game is a spoiler, so it's best to go in as blind as you can. Saying that, it's a cool, science-fantasy story about a race of beings exploring their tiny solar system.

Try it, it's amazing and has a conclusion you'll never see coming. If you want to know more, there's a few things I can share without spoiling too much.",1625097804

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","I put his years because everyone was talking about how amazing his season has been. Here are his career stats. Pretty similar stats all around home vs away outside of WHIP/ERA. ERA is too affected by fielders so I personally find FIP to be a better indicator and that is almost identical, gives up less HRs at Coors, puts more people in play in Coors but that built more around walks. Doesn‚Äôt really speak to the whole ball travels further theory. Also explains his higher WHIP since an extra BB/9 will bring your WHIP ip about .12 on its own. 

Definitely not too 10 pitcher stats home or away through his career. Maybe Top 30, definitely top 50. This isn‚Äôt to say by any means he is bad, just that there are a lot of really good pitchers in MLB that are better than him.

Usman is *exceptionally* good at grinding guys against the cage, though. WB's TDD is quite good, but if Usman wants to pin you to the fence and stomp your toes, there really isn't much any 170er (who isn't a grappler) can do about it.

His footwork (though, Neal was able to get him to the fence on a few occasions) and technical striking definitely make him an interesting matchup for Usman, though. He's definitely skilled enough to exploit Usman's weakest point (his striking defense), but I don't think he'll have much to offer should Usman decide to hold him against the fence.",1625097805

&gt;I'll bet you do that. I wonder how many people with addiction are dead because of you.

&gt;None of them, because i still see them weekly, and thats the rules. 


I'm supposed to believe that anyone working at a methadone clinic never lost a patient?

Liar.

&gt;The rules exist for a reason and theyre there to protect patients. 

Do you also believe HR is there to protect the employee?


&gt;If I gave them a dose that day, and they already had one, and they OD'ed, Id feel worse than if I denied them of a dose and they OD'ed from another drug, because it would mean that I didnt do my job and I didnt follow the rules.

You said you deny people their dose because they missed a day. You think they got their dose elsewhere?? What??

You'd be happy either way. 

&gt;But this is such a stupid thing to say. If you go to a doctor and

&gt;And what do you mean ""documentation of previous doses""? Wtf is that?

&gt;If they got their drink somewhere else, they need to bring in previous receipts to show that theyve consistently been taking their doses.

You're talking about guest patients? And who the hell calls it a ""drink""?

People get guest privileges, but they don't bring their paperwork anymore. It's all electronic. And you only get guest privileges if you're traveling. So if you dose in New York and you get guest privileges in California, you obviously could not have had your NY dose that day.

This is all worked out in advance. 


&gt;See, this is great. If you dont know something, then im perfectly fine with explaining it to you. 

I know you are lying. 

&gt;But you should definitely stop accusing other people of not caring when you have no idea how the rules and regulations work.

Oh, I know quite well how it works. 

&gt;You absolutely, 100% do NOT care about their health. If you did, you'd make sure they got the methadone dose they needed instead of refusing to dispense because they missed a ""crucial day,"" whatever that means.

&gt;Actually, there are various rules around methadone dispensing, including things like missing more than 2/3 consecutive days(depending on the phase) and the pharmacist will cancel your prescription and you will have to see the doctor. 


Pharmacist? Where do you live?

&gt;If we cannot confirm that a patient has infact had their dose within the last 2/3 days, and they are on a high dose, theyll lose tolerance and that dose becomes fatal.

That's such bullshit. You should know how long methadone's half life is. And what if someone is on a low dose? No PWA is overdosing on 10 mgs.


&gt; They need to be reassessed by the doctor and re-initiated on a lower dose to build up tolerance again.

That may be policy, but it's totally irrational. 

&gt;And this is the sad part about our discussion. You dont know how Methadone works.

Think again. I know more about it than you do.


&gt;You dont know the rules and guidelines around it. 

Trust me, I do.


&gt;And yet, without knowing them, you accuse me of not caring about a patients health.

I know all about methadone and methadone clinics -- and I know more than enough to know you don't like your clients -- if you really have any. You don't care about them. And quite a few fell back into addiction and even died because of you.

&gt;Smh.

&gt;I'm not and I never said I was.

&gt;Yeah, I figured that out a while ago.

You want a cookie?

&gt;Maybe you shouldnt tell a pharmacist what is and isnt in their job description when you have no idea what a pharmacist actually does?

I absolutely can tell a pharmacist that giving clients unsolicited advice about their weight is not part of their job.

Women live longer as a matter of biology, as men age faster. Thus for your assertion to be true, the difference in male-female life expectancy must be greater than the biological difference in life expectancy at a significant degree.

Holding until at least $20/share which will net a paper profit of $2m in tendies.

Interested in RAC? **Please note it's a speculative bio-tech stock and may yet prove utterly useless.**

If you want more info about RAC here's 30 second summary for those of you with ADD:

RAC own the patent for a drug called Bisantrene, which was initially trialled in the 80s with great success, only to be left on the sidelines due to a limited application and cost of pursuing further research. It‚Äôs since been rediscovered and preclinical through to phase 1 results have so far proven successful.

As a company RAC are executing a three pillar strategy over the next 12-18 months with a steady stream of trial results coming through over that time. They've made it blatantly clear the aim is to get picked up by big pharma at the end of their phase 2 trials and that they're looking for maximum shareholder value‚Ñ¢ in the process, as the board are significant shareholders.

If you want some more info on why I‚Äôm taking the punt:

There‚Äôs an excellent rundown on RAC by an asset management company [here](https://mfam.com.au/research/race-oncology-asx-rac/) or an overly optimistic Haute Crapper thread [here](https://hotcopper.com.au/attachments/rac-upside-5-february-2021-pdf.2883401/), which also has a stack more info as well.

Or you can get a rundown of RAC and their recent activities from the company themselves [here](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02359202-6A1026814?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=eEz8yMjSPwE).

Or if you‚Äôre a nerd a lot of the science stuff is [here](https://hotcopper.com.au/attachments/bisantrene-synthesis-fto-1-pdf.2950305/?filename=Bisantrene+Synthesis+-+FTO+1.pdf).
For those of you who can‚Äôt read good, and want learn to do other stuff good too, [here‚Äôs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoMWPf98W1k) Race‚Äôs CSO talking about the journey, or a RAC holder taking a crack at breaking down the science [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKyfK5MDp_0)

If you want to read a dumpster fire of a Reddit thread which presents some counterarguments from oncology doctors it can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX/comments/lslrpf/rac_on_the_asx_why_is_this_flying_under_the_radar/) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ausstocks/comments/nhk9gh/race_oncology_excellent_video_to_break_down_the/).

CNN anchor Don Lemon said that the most imminent terrorist threat facing the U.S. is ‚Äúwhite men.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them,‚Äù Lemon said to fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo during a segment Monday night.

‚ÄúThere is no travel ban on them,‚Äù Lemon continued. ‚ÄúThere is no ban on ‚Äï you know, they had the Muslim ban. There is no white guy ban.‚Äù

So Donnie boy wants a ban on 60% of the country. And he‚Äôs also lying about the ‚Äúmuslim‚Äù ban. Travel was stopped from those middle eastern countries because they were designated as terror states by Obama.

Harness/ your hopes
on just one person/
because you know a harness/
was only made for one

Don't telegraph your passes/
You'll end up with molasses/
cauterized in syrup/
And syrup and molasses

And I'm checking out the asses/
The assets that attract us/
To anything that moves/
We're deep inside the grooves/

And it's time to shake the rations/
cause someone's gonna cash in/
The plot it turns again/
The reference starts at ten/

Well show me/
A word that rhymes with Pavement/
And I won't kill your parents/
And roast them on a spit/

And a-don't you try to etch it/
Or permanently sketch it/
Or your gonna catch a bad bad cold/

And the freaks have stormed the white house/
I moved into a lighthouse/
It's on a scenic quay/
It's oh so far away/



Far away from the beginning/
The shroud is made of linen/
The yearling took the purse/
The goth kid has a hearse/

Heart-breaking/
Earth-quaking/
Kiwis they are home baking/
Minds wide open truly/

Leisure/
A leisure suit is nothing/
It's nothing to be proud of/
In this late century/

And I'm asking you to hold me/
Just like the morning paper/
Pinched between your pointer/
Your index and your thumb/

It's a semi-automatic/
Believers are ecstatic/
You see the way they cling/
The cold metallic sting/

And I'm living in a coma/
For Donna de Varona/
The harness made of hopes/
The lovers on the ropes/

Nun is to church/
As the parrot is to perch/
And my Heart's/
Wide open Truly/",1625097809

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***

Context: I live in BC, Canada, where we've been having an insane heatwave for the past weekish. 
I (20f) took to sleeping in the spare bedroom in the basement to get out of the heat. Right next to the bedroom is the bathroom. The bathroom also connects to an ""office room"" of sorts where I moved my laptop for the time being. 

My sister and her friend (both 15f) had a sleepover last night, and because of the heat, slept downstairs as well.  They slept in the ""main room"", on mattresses on the floor. I offered to let them take the spare room but they politely declined because there isn't a TV in the spare room.

So, I'm in the office room on my laptop, playing some games with my friends. My sister's friend pops her head in from the bathroom and says ""Hey sorry! Just getting ready for bed!"" and closes the door. I go back to my games and eventually she leaves. 

About 15 minutes later I have to use the washroom myself, but when I walk in, the toilet hasn't been flushed and there's pee on the seat. I'm thoroughly grossed out, but I flush the toilet and wipe the seat down, then go use the bathroom upstairs. 

Later, I texted my sister while she was out with her friend and let her know that someone wasn't flushing the toilet downstairs. She waved it off, saying that her friend probably DID flush. I'm frustrated, but it's not a huge deal, maybe it's a one time thing. 

I leave the house to go get some groceries (sister and her friend have come back to the house by this point), go downstairs, and the toilet is once again unflushed and dirty.

I don't wanna confront her friend because she seems like a real nice and polite girl, but I also don't want to have to clean up a relative stranger's pee. This is also a very temporary situation (the girl's spent maybe 2 days and a night at our house) so it's likely I won't have to deal with it again.

"COMPLETEANARCHY","t5_397x6","I remember clearly the deaths of three men. One was the richest man of the century, who, having clawed his way to wealth through the souls and bodies of men, spent many years trying to buy back the love he had forfeited and by that process performed great service to the world and, perhaps, had much more than balanced the evils of his rise. I was on a ship when he died. The news was posted on the bulletin board, and nearly everyone received the news with pleasure. Several said, ‚ÄúThank God that son of a bitch is dead.‚Äù

Then there was a man, smart as Satan, who lacking some perception of human dignity and knowing all to well every aspect of human weakness and wickedness, used his special knowledge to warp men, to buy men, to bribe and threaten and seduce until he found himself in a position of great power. He clothed his motives in the names of virtue, and I have wondered whether he ever knew that no gift will ever buy back a man‚Äôs love when you have removed his self love. A bribed man can only hate his briber. When this man died the nation rang with praise and, just beneath, with gladness that he was dead.

There was a third man, who perhaps made many errors in performance but whose effective life was devoted to making men brave and dignified and good in a time when they were poor and frightened and when ugly forces were loose in the world to utilize their fears. This man was hated by the few. When he died the people burst into tears in the streets and their minds wailed, ‚ÄúWhat can we do now? How can we go on without him?‚Äù

Part of my ""rules for suicide"" is that you gotta be free of all legitimate debts so you're not just killing yourself to get out of paying. This is a serious issue with doctor assisted suicide cause insurance will go ""we won't cover the treatment to keep you alive for another year so you can live with your family but we will pay for you to die. so which is it? 200k or death?""

I use the word ""legitimate"" cause imo student loan debts aren't legitimate cause education is necessary and colleges charge way too fucking much and student loans are way too predatory.

Even after that, if someone wants to kill themselves because society is racist or not accepting of them I think the solution here would be to work to fix society.

I was only really talking about people who legitimately do not enjoy life. Like, they have friends, a chill job, amazing house, everything they ever wanted and they still go ""yeah, this is cool, but I'd rather just be dead""",1625097811

If you look back at the replays I'm sure that you will notice mistakes of your own. Of course, not every game is winnable, but you would have to be astronomically unlucky to lose all those games if your ""actual"" mmr was a lot higher. Maybe the answer is that people have gotten a lot better and that's why you're lower mmr than in 2018. Certainly that is the case for myself.

I think it was on Down to Dunk where they brought up taking on Kevin Love‚Äôs contract to get to the 3rd pick. If Presti can get the third pick that 100% opens up moving to 1 or 2 is a real possibility. Houston at this point would likely love to have control of their draft picks that the Thunder has rights to. Detroit on the other hand wouldn‚Äôt mind some potential draft assets going forward to help the rebuild. It just depends on what guys front offices are sold on and are targeting.

i hang out in a lot of subreddits, facebook groups, and on discord with a lot of engineers, pentesters, and computer science people. 

most of these people are very friendly and love to learn things and self-improve themselves, based on my experience, these people are generally pretty happy to talk and help and explain things, when they see that you are also into learning and development of new skillsets.

one thing, ive noticed on discord especially that security people are a little bit more terse and ""less nice"" to newcomers, but mainly because hacking has become a meme, and dozens of people ask stupid questions like ""can u h4xx my roblox account to give me more robucks XD"" 

HOWEVER, if you show that you are willing to learn, almost no one is going to berate you or try to make you feel stupid. 

bottom line is that people tend to be nicer irl then behind a screen. most likely the IT department will admire your efforts and you will probably get along with them just fine. i feel like they are smart enough to not have unrealistic expectations from someone who doesn't work in that feild.

"Gaming_Headsets","t5_3bvrd","# Music FPS Sound Style Guide (Auto Message)

[Simplified Reddit Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifelongCaboose/comments/kpzteo/11c_lifelongcabooses_wired_music_fps/)

Full External Website Link (Coming Late 2021)

**Quick Info**

1. **Music FPS:** Headphones that meet the criteria of the **Music** category first but can still offer decent competitive fps performance.  Pretty much slightly worse for music. This is a weird in-between guide, I  will be including all the other sound styles that these fit in so you can kinda see which way the headphone leans in terms of gaming performance. In general, if you care most about music look for something also marked **Music Gaming.**  Some headphones will also be listed here at a different price from other sections and please pay attention to that, as some headphones will only be a good option in this category if at the right price.
2. **Grades:** You will see every headphone/headset has two grades. The **1st Grade** being its **Tonality Grade**, this is the grade for how well its sound signature is tonally balanced. The **2nd Grade** is its **Technical Performance Grade**, so all things outside of the frequency response.
3. **PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE CLOSED BACK RANKS WITH OPEN BACK ONES AT THIS TIME. (**[Link to my Beta grading System](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifelongCaboose/comments/jxz6to/sneak_peak_at_my_grading_system/)**)**
4. **Rankings are not everything:** Which is why I will try to include notes with them.
5. **Sound Signature VS Sound Style:** Sound Signature is the tuning of the frequency response. Sound Style is my term for the different categories I put headphones in for gaming.
6. **VMBP:** This indicates Vmoda Boom Pro compatibility, Prices do not include the mic.
7. **HS:** This indicates it's a Headset, noting it has a built-in mic.
8. **EQ/VSS**: If you need to use some light eq to help, go for it just be careful. Maybe even Virtual Surround Sound(VSS) if you can't position with stereo. I don't recommend VSS but some need it.
9. **BR:** Bass roll-off. Indicates rolled off bass extension.
10. **Mod Mic:** A Mod mic isn't a category of mics it's a product line of attachable Mic made by antlion that can turn any headphone into a Gaming headset.
11. **External USB/XLR Mic:** If you plan to buy an XLR/USB mic for gaming please get a Dynamic mic, it will cancel out background noise better. (Don't buy a Yeti)

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","A map room would be cool if you're prepared to give them a bunch of maps.  A world map, a detailed map of the surrounding area, a couple other area maps (one near by and one across the world), and at least one city map would be my suggestion.  Present the maps as being in the map room of course.  After that it becomes more of an RP thing.

An armory is always cool.  I would equip it with both a Blacksmith and a Master at Arms.  These NPCs can serve a few different functions.  Training for the party-- grant a Fighting Style or a single Battle Master Maneuver?   Minor quest giver type.  Blacksmith is having trouble finding some rare metal?  Gold sink.  With an investment they can equip and train soldiers.

A barracks!  Duh.  The soldiers sleep here.  Include some surly veterans always complaining about the wet behind the ears raw recruits.  Include a plucky underdog recruit--too small/young, but is always positive and tries harder than anyone.  If the manor is attacked down the line, let him do some crazy heroics.

Library.  Kooky old sage as the librarian.  No talent for magic, but knows everything about it.  Every now and again his contacts can come up with a new spell scroll or better yet the location of one.  Generate some quests and your Wizard or Ritual Book player will love this guy.

Stables.  If they don't have mounts yet, it comes with horses.  If they do, it comes with griffins.  Once again include an NPC to run it and suggest some quests.

After that just character specific stuff.",1625097814

Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Regina (where second site was discovered) has also pledged full co-operation but their records are very incomplete and probably won't help much. The Bishop there is also setting up a meeting with Pope and Indigenous leaders currently (https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/archbishop-says-canadian-bishops-organizing-meeting-with-pope-and-indigenous-leaders).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Even growing up and I‚Äôm my early 30‚Äôs the private schools still had corporal punishment. It wasn‚Äôt common but if you screwed up the principal would spank you once in his office with a paddle.  No for those wondering it was nothing sexual.  

Looking back at it I laugh because honestly the principals spankings were a joke. I realize in other places though it wasn‚Äôt and it was just straight child abuse. 

I remember finding it funny because one time I got one and the principal always called the parents before doing it. Your options were get spanked or a 1 day suspension. I begged the principal to spank me without calling my mom he did not. My mom drove to the school so she could issue the spanking. The principal was like uhh that‚Äôs not really how this works thinking my mom would ‚Äúlet me off easy‚Äù. Boy oh boy was he wrong (which I knew he would be). After about the 5th or 6th swat he was like I think that‚Äôs enough and she was like no not yet. She hit harder than he would and he only did 1 swat lol. I remember the next time I got in trouble deserving a swat and he was like yeah... just hang out in my office for a bit and do some homework. We‚Äôre not calling your mom for this haha. 

Funny because looking back I‚Äôm like yeah spankings were totally deserved. I didn‚Äôt get spanked often and I never thought ‚Äúthis is abuse‚Äù. Never had any long term issues with it where it caused tension between me and my mom.",1625097817

Easy to have a huge outbreak. 

However, now that we are opening up, all of a sudden there is a huge concern about children under 12 &amp; them being masked up. Almost everywhere I went during the last year &amp; a half, most kids I saw under the age of 10 or so were not wearing masks.

"PilotsofBattlefield","t5_sokte","Splitting my comments in two, lol. 

I'm a BF1 main pilot. Started with BF3/BF4, but only really became an ace in BF1. I love that game for flying, and it's impressive how you can implement classic Dogfighting maneuvers in it. It's a very controversial opinion, but I find BF1 the best battlefield for pilots. 

I also think BF1 is right now the best Battlefield to learn the basics with. BF4 is sort of hard to learn how to fly, the few people left playing it are very skilled in taking planes down. It's not easy for beginners. 

BFV has a rather ""unfair"" system, where you need to grind to unlock the best kits, and until then, you're at the mercy of pilots with better planes. It also has Attrition which makes flying a much less intuitive thing, and imo takes some of the fun out of it. 

With that being said, what makes a great pilot in each of these games tends to be quite different. A good pilot in BF4 has great speed control. A good pilot in BF1 knows how to do maneuvers like rolling scissors or yoyo. A good pilot in BFV is a master in freelooking or stalling.

The basics of planes through these games are fairly similar, but the specifics to gain air superiority is usually quite different. That creates a lot of debate on which is the best game, but it's also pretty awesome.

Let me know if you need any tips in BF1, I'm always happy to help.

Good luck!",1625097819

There's a place for hobby breeders, but, the one thing that separates a backyard breeder from a hobby breeder is quality. A hobby breeder wants to ensure that the dogs are going to get great homes, that their dog is healthy and meets the OFA health requirements of both breeds in the mix (and the other parent too). A backyard breeder doesn't care about any of that.

(Bedframes, mattresses, sheets, pillows, duvets, duvet covers, couches, chairs, dining table, coffee table, side tables, lamps, dishes, silverware, coffee machine, pots, pans, kitchen towels, bathroom towels, bathroom towel rack, rugs, TV's, artwork, TV-stand/tv-mount, hot pads, baking trays. Then perishables, cooking oils, spices, soaps, shampoo. Internet service, renters insurance.. and much more).

I recently got two 760sqft condos ready for Airbnb, it cost me $7,400 per unit to fully furnish/decorate and prepare them. If you do it cheap you will rent them for cheap, if you do them nice you will get a higher rate..

Personally I don't know the rental market in Dallas right now so I can't speak to what it will take to find a unit available for subletting as STR. So do your research, but run your numbers and price EVERYTHING out before you sign any type of lease and make sure you can afford to do it, and look at your financials and run a worst case scenario of no income with two leases, can you afford to pay both..",1625097821

When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.

You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....

"tifu","t5_2to41","The total price was shown, it wasn't a per-acre thing it was just ""here's the price, take it or leave it""

The problem was the obscene amount of money people spent on hobby farms in the countryside around where I currently live, when I saw this it seems reasonable for 25 acres compared to the prices I seen. They were two factors that I had forgot to consider:

1. The land was strictly for agricultural use ONLY, a lot of the super-wealthy build a house on the land and then set up a hobby farm. NO planning permission would ever be approved on this site. (apart from agricultural buildings but they aren't dwellings)
2. The land was in Wales and people seem to avoid buying land anywhere that isn't England so the lack of the demand and glut of supply drove the price down

Also, I don't think the lawyer really cared because he already made his money selling the house and just wanted rid of the rest of the assets so he could close the file. From what I gathered it was a estate with no living heir so the lawyer was instructed to sell the assets and bunch of farmland in eastern Wales isn't exactly prime real estate.

Obviously, this is pretty atypical for a screenwriter. When I got to set, they had me write two new scenes.

"Tools","t5_2r8ec","The newest high-end handheld laser distance measuring devices actually have settings that allow you to measure between points on a photo the device takes of the intended target (with a laser pointer defining exactly which points you wish to measure), and will even calculate square footage and volume, all from the ground. I don‚Äôt know what kind of tolerances you‚Äôre dealing with, but I was quite impressed with the accuracy of the units that were demo‚Äôd to me a few months back. They aren‚Äôt cheap, but they are built specifically for the kind of task you‚Äôre describing. The ones I was shown are made by bosch, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other manufacturers using the same tech. Start searching down that path.

"LegendsOfRuneterra","t5_3a3ge","Ok time to be an ass.

Lets say you start game 40 card deck, draw 4 to start, draw 1 at round start so 35 left in deck and you predict for 1 copy of 3 cards in the deck. 

You have an 31.4% chance to draw exactly what you want and that increases slightly with every card drawn from the deck.

Without it your chance to draw what you want is around 8.6% chance.

So if you have 1 or 2 key cards that your success depends on, this can make or break the run.

But its even better than that, you are guarenteed a 0 mana created spell every turn. If you are playing Heimer, Fizz or buffed a card to benefit from spell casts this is a consistent and powerful buff.",1625097823
