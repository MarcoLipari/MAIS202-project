The UK conservative party (Tories) are equivalent to the US Democrats who support national health care, government programs, subsidized school lunch programs and support cheaper higher education. W...hat is equivalent to the US Republicans, Tea Bagger and GOP platform to the rest of the world? Fascists? Military Party? Corporate?

We are a young country and it just seems that we are not looking towards those free countries who have tried (and failed) at a conservative government.

I believe in a fiscal policy but the US is the richest country in the world. We should not be in debt, have poor, uneducated, homeless. We should have the best National Health care, not national insurance.

One of the promising GOP candidates will be bringing a bill (when he is elected) to have a $2000 deductible for anyone on Medicare or Medicaid.

It is time to stop being a country that is so politically sustained by capitalism and profit. I don't care if it is a republican or democrat in office.

How a country takes care of its poor, not the rich, is the reflection of its greatness. The US has failed its citizens by throwing out out the Republic for Capitalism (Kleptocracy).

The Amish were founded by John Amish in 1242. Prof. Amish aimed for a society in which modern thought was ignored, in favor of more ""pure"" pursuits. Back then his group vowed to ignore many things, including Chinese civilization, science, technology, philosophy and literature.

The Amish have slowly progressed, slightly behind the rest of the world and it is estimated that in 2112 Prof. Amish's group will embrace the internet, closely followed by the iPod, iPhone and other mobile devices around 2120.

It is, of course, impossible to predict what the internet will be like at that point in time, but it is assumed most civilized societies will have moved on to something more technologically advanced and the Amish will find themselves in cyberspace, with no one to share it with.","1288569629"

I've learned to save opening the throttle up for twisty farm country back roads and over mountains and stuff. I'd rather leave earlier and have a relaxing ride through traffic than speed (even though it's fun) and risk more points on the license.

Just because you ride a fast bike doesn't mean you need to ride it fast everywhere you go.

Edit: Cruiser riders riding ability has never impressed me thus far. They don't speed, and it seems like they're only out on a bike for the sake of actually being on one and looking cool, rather than finding the good roads and riding bikes like they're meant to be ridden (more fast than not and with a good degree of lean).

However, you're as likely to get pills which contain nothing, contain something other than what you ordered, are expired and not effective, etc as you are to get what you paid for.  There was some research done awhile back (couple years maybe?  Google should know) where they ordered things from many places and tested them, and it was about 50/50 which ones actually sold quality prescription drugs.

Birth control pills would not likely be too difficult to find.  Controlled substances, things which are Scheduled, are going to be much, much harder to find than simple prescription drugs simply because they are watched for, and those places busted with far more frequency.  With normal prescription drugs, you would probably never face any legal consequences... but with controlled substances, if Customs picks your package to search, you could be in quite deep trouble.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","I've studied this a lot and would be happy to talk to you about it if you like.

A few months ago a redditor I met on a thread addressing these sorts of issues pointed me at the book [Good Calories, Bad Calories](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Gary-Taubes/dp/1400040787) by Gary Taubes.  Based on what I read there and the followup reading I have done I believe that what Taubes is saying is reliable and makes sense.  I'd definitely recommend reading that and [In defense of food](http://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/) by Michael Pollan.

My personal take on all this is:

* There is significant variation between people.  The only way to know what works for you in particular is to try eating a certain way and pay attention to how you feel in response.  

* Most of what we have been told about dietary fat and cholesterol for the last 30 years is wrong -- both in accuracy and in motivation.  Taubes tells this story in detail in his book and in some lectures available as [online videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVvZP2av5Mk&amp;feature=related).  [This guy](http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/) has interesting things to say about the science of cholesterol in the body.

* You don't need to eat a lot of carbohydrates or grains.  The official guidelines that you should also appear to be questionable in their accuracy and motivation.  You can if it makes you happy, but they are not essential.  Many people follow diets that cut out grains and high glycemic carbohydrates (like potatoes) and do fine.  Guests on [this podcast show](http://www.thelivinlowcarbshow.com/shownotes/) have a lot of interesting things to say on this topic.  

* I personally think how contaminated the fats are from how an animal is raised is a bigger factor than people realize.  If people in a study eat factory farmed meat, how would you distinguish whether it was increased saturated fat or increased toxic residues which was responsible for any negative effects?  I do eat meat (including red meat), butter, eggs, cheese, etc. but only from animals that were raised by people I trust to not use chemicals, antibiotics, etc., to raise them on pasture, etc.  I also eat wild alaskan salmon.

* I use ghee (clarified butter) for cooking and flax oil for putting on salads.  I eat lots of foods that naturally contain oils: meat, eggs, fish, dairy, nut butters, avocados, nuts, etc. but nothing else for added fats.  I used to use olive oil, but got concerned that it's susceptible to oxidation damage and I don't know of a good source that I trust to handle it properly.  

* I've seen enough people whose opinions I respect say that other types of extracted oils -- corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil, etc. -- are bad news that I stay away from them.  These are sometimes referred to collectively as PUFA oils.  The main issues seem to be that they have a bad impact on omega 3/omega 6 ratio (the idea is to try to maximize omega 3 and minimize omega 6), and are bad news wrt oxidation damage.  Chris Masterjohn has a lot to say on this topic.

* Eating lots of veggies and fruits generally seems like a good idea.  Their effects are complex and some people have problems with some of them (I, for instance, have issues with nightshade).  I try to eat the ones I know I can eat safely as much as I can manage.

* Eating processed food and fast food seems like a bad idea for many reasons and I stay away from them.  Michael Pollan has good things to say on this topic.  I know that not everyone can manage the time and logistical complexity that this entails, but it's probably going to help to make an effort to minimize them.

Anyway, that's where I'm at in my exploration of this topic.  Ultimately everyone needs to comes up with their own answers.  Good luck with your own journey.  The fact that you're consciously thinking about these things and trying to figure it out puts you far ahead of most.  Let me know if you'd like to chat about any of this.","1288569642"

The story itself is through the eyes of three people.

That's it in a nutshell. I've never really done something like this but I'm excited. There's a bunch of details I obviously didn't hammer out but I guess I'll figure those out in the re-write. ","1288569649"

"Morocco","t5_2qpwb","Apparently no one is this subreddit is interested in having a nice discussion. First, the 2006 Palestinian elections were closely monitored by the International Quarlet On the Middle East (EU, UN, UK, Russia and the US) and yet, people voted for the party that was most hated by those forces. Still, no one doubted the results. But that's not what we're discussing here.      
Morocco is a liberalized autocracy. No different from countries like Jordan, Kuwait etc... A quick look at all Arab states will reveal that all of those countries are ruled by outdated authoritarian regimes backed by Western countries. It doesnt matter how bad you think Democracy is, it cant be worse than these kinds of governments. Morocco is blessed with a political and cultural stability, one of the fastest growing economies in Africa, a multi-party political system and a significantly more liberal society than most arab countries, all which constitute a good environmental for any young democracy. Sure, a complete political reform will be required but the outcomes will definitely be worth it.

"science","t5_mouw","You're an atheist attending a Catholic university? That sucks. 

But I'll say this in my defense: I'm 25 years old, and I've seen a LOT of assholes and hypocrites. Really, really, really fucked up people. I've known parents who beat the living fuck out of their children and guys who date-rape and worse. The vast, vast, vast majority of seriously fucked-up people I've met in my life are religious. I am *wholly* confident in my disdain for religion and the people who choose to follow it. 

Of course there are exceptions, and of course people who don't believe in a god or gods can be and are fucked up as well. But the vast, vast **VAST** (DID I SAY THIS LOUD ENOUGH, MOTHERFUCKER?) majority of the really REALLY fucked up people I've met in my life are religious.

So, no, I'm not going to look at your professor who rallied against the bishop who hates gays and say ""Oh, how pretty! A Catholic who isn't a dumbass or a pedophile!""

Maybe it's because I live in the bible belt, I don't know, but people are fucking horrible. NO, REALLY, THEY ARE. And the only thing I hate worse than a pedophile is a pedophile hypocrite, supported by hypocrites, who then claim to have a *moral high-ground* and defend the pedophiles. Yes, I'm looking at Catholics. 

Again, no, I don't care if I lose karma here and I don't care that there are exceptions. There aren't **ENOUGH** exceptions. So, go ahead and downvote away, I have enough karma to take the hit.  

I just can't stand people like you either, who think that they are special because they can see a Bishop shun homosexuals and not be angry about it. Well, I can't. Fuck that Bishop, and every single Catholic who saw him and didn't stand up and fucking yell the moment it happened. Fuck every Catholic who didn't leave the church when they found out about the child-fucking, and the Vatican covering it up. Fuck you and your theology professor for letting it happen because it's against some dogma to stand up in church and speak out.","1288569657"
"prowrestling","t5_2qhk0","* The Tag Team titles should be considered a first tier title. The TT division is pretty much dead. 

* Go back to a Mature rating since there's nothing PG about fake fighting. 

* Longer matches that resemble more of a Japanese strong style. I know it's pretty much impossible, but ego's need to be checked at the door and losing shouldn't be a big deal since it's fake anyway. Just put on good matches and people will pay. 

* More Japan. Bring in talent from Japan and make it sort of like how the UFC integrated the Pride roster. A Yakuza angle is too predictable. Push Yoshi Tazu, having him bring in his ""friends"" from Japan, put the tag titles on them with a Freebirds type style rotation and then have guys like Punk, Danielson, Bourne and Low Ki join them to make a run at singles titles. In the short term, put them in spotfests to gain popularity. In the long run, have HBK come out as their ""mentor"" and he'll put them over saying how when he came in he was considered too small and he ended up being one of the best. Everyone loves a ""Rudy"" story. 

* Less Dusty finishes. 

* Less women's wrestling... for the time being. I say put women's wrestling only on one of the programs (RAW, SD or Superstars) and start to filter out the bad talent so that the roster is solid.

* Take a page out of Dana White's book and stop worrying about win-loss records (or jobbing in WWE's case) and talk about how it's a fight and anything can happen but as long as it's competitive and entertaining the wrestler will always have a good billing. 

* More heels. 

* Less interference with GM, owners and the like. You may see Dana White's face a lot but he's always talking about the company and his roster of talent. The WWE's GM/owner characters all seem to be out there to make wrestlers miserable. Have them initiate their feuds on their own more and the heat between talent will seem more believable instead of seeming forced.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","Well, for one, binary branching helps capture some descriptive facts that ternary branching doesn't help capture. We know there's more structure to a DP (NP with a D tacked over it) because we can see this structure by replacing different things in it. A pronoun replaces a whole DP, and 'one' can replace NPs.

* the brown dog =&gt; it
* the brown dog =&gt; the brown one
* that brown dog =&gt; that one (definiteness and one-replacement is a little sticky in English).

This can be brought out a bit in other ways, too. 'One' in the sentence below can either refer to a red firetruck or just a firetruck (although there's probably a preference for one interpretation over the other).

* Maria wants this red firetruck, and Tommy wants that one.

Interpreting these facts, you get a structure sort of like [(DP) the [(NP) [(AP) brown] [(NP) dog]]]. Sticking all of 'the', 'brown, and 'dog' under one NP node doesn't allow you to capture these basic descriptive facts since 'brown' and 'dog' aren't a unit.

There's some theoretical reasons that come to mind readily as well. Allowing any number of elements on the right-side of your rule gives you the opportunity to create enormously powerful rules which don't seem to obviously exist in natural language (it's an empirical point whether they do or not, but evidence suggests no). Binarity limits the complex of the theory, which is a good guiding principle for theory building. Within words, we don't typically see n-ary branching --- words seem to have binary branching internal structure. And, as a conceptual idea, putting two things together is a simpler process than putting together n things.

Binary branching is the norm in syntax these days, since there's some good theoretical as well as empirical reasons for accepting it.

(As a side-point, binary branching falls out of the theoretical mechanisms that Chomsky uses, but as far as I'm aware he's hardly the first to propose it.)","1288569665"

&gt; The fallacy is in assuming there are only two positions and that the truth must reside in the middle.

That's called a false dilemma.

&gt; Perhaps you've made a mistake in your first premise because it is false that there is always only one (or two) extreme views.

It's not my premise.  It is assumed true by your own reasoning, which has been proven invalid.  The proof is why the premise must be false.  This is why logicians use calculus.   When premises lead to a false conclusion, logicians question the premises.

People come by here all the time and thank us as a whole for helping in their deconversion, but they almost never point to one thing, or one person, that was central to it when they do.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; I did some cursory research on this, and found that there was a schism in within Freemasonry in 1877 after the Grand Orient de France decided to allow atheists into their lodges. Apparently the ""Anglo"" lodges no longer view this organization as legitimate. What do you think of them?

They're clandestine lodges.

&gt; Whatever your opinion on the matter, it seems strange that you wouldn't even mention this group's existence. Are they simply dismissed as ""heretical"" (or something to that effect)? Do they not count?

In my opinion, no. They don't count. I choose not to address the issue, because to me, they're not ""true"" Freemasons.

(Limbo does not have to be a thing of darkness because it is not the Catholic version but a slang term to describe the state after experiencing false death while in the machine induced dream state)

Actually the evidential criteria required for such a conviction is so high that it is unlikely to ever occur. The prospect of punishment primarily serves as a social deterrent against publicly blatant acts of adultery. Muslim extremists just ignore the high burden of evidence required by the Quran to reach such a conviction and make up their own.

&gt;What is a ""moderate atheist""? The only thing atheists have in common is a lack of belief in a deity. There is no atheist dogma, there are no atheist rules, or recommendations on how we are to punish evil doers.

Atheism is the irrational belief that God does not exist. The belief itself carries significant philosophical and ethical implications. For example, as the existentialists noted, if God does not exist everything is permissible. Its no surprise then that the worst atrocities and genocides in history were perpetrated by atheists. 

&gt;This is an old slander. Stalin and Mao didn't kill and murder in the name of atheism or because they were atheists. What would be the point?

That's just trite ""new atheist"" apologetics. Stalin and Mao killed and murdered to create an atheist utopia free of Religion. As mentioned above, they thought everything was permissible to fulfill this goal, including genocide and mass-murder. This is why atheism is so dangerous.","1288569752"

""none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available for international military education and training, foreign military financing, foreign military sales, direct commercial sales, or excess Defense articles by the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-102) or any other Act making appropriations for foreign operations, export financing, and related programs""  
  
And, although it has been listed below, here is quick breakdown of the aid:  
  
1. Yemen - Fighting al-Qaeda. Yeah, everyone hates this idea.  
  
2. Sudan - Building ""Military Institutions"" in the south. The south of Sudan is about secede. In this part of the world, that is suicidal if you have no defenses.  
  
3. Congo - ""Helping the military become more professional and less abusive."" A touch of cosmic irony here, but sounds good to me.  
  
4. Chad - ""because of its role in fighting terrorism,"" *and* ""assistance with the humanitarian crisis in Sudan"" (See #2, the one that's about to implode in January.),  *and* ""helping that country's military end its practice of using child soldiers."" Terrorism aside, these are good reasons.  
  
I seriously doubt anyone in this administration (or the previous one) actually *wants* child soldiers. But the moral choices are never as simple as we make them out to be. What exactly is southern Sudan going to do with boxes of medial supplies and food when the north comes to slaughter them? What would Chad do as they help out? What exactly is wrong with helping the Congo's military become ""more professional and less abusive?"" Etc, etc.

I don't know why, but there seem to be a fair number of people who have the soul of a used car dealer, and have gotten into advocating Linux. They will say whatever it takes to close the deal. So if someone says they need a system that does X, Y, and Z, these people will tell them Linux does those things, better and cheaper than Windows, even if they have no idea whether or not that is true.

So you end up with people, for instance, who know that a small publisher or two has used Scribus to publish a book or magazine, and then will tell people that Linux + Scribus will be an easy replacement for, and with all the capabilities of, Windows + InDesign, for a large professional publisher. They'll pitch Linux + GIMP as being better in all ways than Windows + Photoshop.

Think about it: do we really need a massive-scale catastrophe (such as a regional/national/continental/global flood) to take place in order to make a culture believe the catastrophe was indeed, global?

To a man living thousands of years ago, a regional flood may seem as if it did cover the whole world, particularly when people in that age very rarely traveled far enough to know of any world beyond the flood plain.  Given the size of the Ark, and given the amount of species in the world, it's easy to see that the Ark myth was intended to impact a man that had not fully grasped the scale of the Earth.

Chances are, if you're a human living in a non-migratory civilization, then you live around a body of water.  Chances are, at some point in time, this body of water will flood.  Is there any wonder as to why the flood myth could be so universal?  Floods are so damaging and so massive, that it would seemingly require a god to do (at least to an ancient man).

I don't think the ""average"" CS grad can compare to me. 

The biggest difference, I think, is that when I have a problem, I look for ways to solve it that make sense, are efficient, solve the problem thoroughly, and have minimal impact on the rest of the system. I think a grad is more likely to apply overly complex solutions, or solutions that just don't really make sense. There's a saying about hitting screws with a hammer or something.

Aside from that, there are also things that you don't learn in school. The social skills needed to succeed (i.e. figuring out the real requirements), how to make good designs, never reinventing the wheel, and so on.

It's my personal opinion that people whose careers are in academia have no business teaching people who are going to go on to be software developers, so I kind of look down on graduates at first glance.

ZSNES is dead simple, just run ""zsnes PATH_OF_ROM"", it'll load the game automatically (the path is based on your home folder by default.)  It also supports wildcards, so if the rom you get has spaces in the name and icky version numbers, you can just give ZSNES the start of the name, like ""zsnes roms/SMW/Sup*""

Simply set up a desktop shortcut for each game, and maybe give them appropriate sprite-based icons so he can recognize them.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It faltered in a number of key areas for me.  All my opinion, and some of it VERY subjective.

1:  Bland world.  There is a whole lot to explore this time, and it all somehow seems much more bland to me than the linear paths of Fable 1.  Perhaps it's the removal of any meaningful loot?  In Fable 1 there was always that carrot (sometimes literally) that kept you exploring.

2:  Somewhat childish story.  While I feel the story was presented in a more entertaining way than Fable 2, I feel it really focused on pure black and white morality.  Even the choices where you can do something really good seemed to have a equally black side effect.

3:  WTH is up with removing loot in RPGs?  Diablo 2 + LOD is still 40 dollars.  That whole game is based on loot.  Oh boy, a chest!  I get either a boring potion or POINTLESS gold.  Blarg.

4:  The 'leveling' system, if you can call it that.  Where are the cool unlockable abilities?  I have to spend guild seals (XP) to learn how to play Pat-A-Cake? 

5:  The stores...  Why can't you just have a menu of what they sell?  You mean to tell me that merchant went to all the trouble of setting up their little stall to sell ONE potion?

6:  The menu system.  I appreciate trying new things.  Now, learn from the mistake.  Sheesh.

7:  I could not care less about multiplayer in these types of games.  I understand the majority do, but for me it's just wasted development time.  It's one of the reasons Bioshock had no multiplayer.  The developer wanted to focus on making a really good single player experience.  And honestly, most games that don't FOCUS on multiplayer just end up being wastelands after a few weeks/months.

8: The combat is SO bland this time around.  No cool boss fights, no big monsters that require agility.  I beat the whole game by pressing B for 3 seconds, then releasing it. The melee is a JOKE.  And the ranged is TERRIBLE this time.  Anyone else remember how fun it was to fight the big stone guys in Fable 1?  How to took some timing and skill?  All gone here.

With open source, I either fix it myself, find a workaround, or report the bug and wait to see if it gets fixed in a timely manner.

* Annually more money comes out of Africa (for debts and interests) than goes in (from international aid).

Furthermore, most of the money that comes in is composed of conditional loans : loans that must be spent buying products from the donor's country on projects that the donor chooses.

End result : international aid for the most part, as it is, destroys third-world economies, has little to no impact on the receiving countries and is usually used as a tool for countries to help out their industries by circumventing sponsorship and government subsidizing clauses in international free-trade agreements.

* food aid is often used as a economical weapon to force countries in to adopting certain crops or agricultural practices. 

* Step 1 : send massive amounts of free food to country A who is in a hard spot (quasi-famine) but could manage with minimal aid. 
* Step 2 : watch local producers of food crash and burn trying to compete with free food. 
* Step 3 : send in the corporations to pick up the pieces and ""reorganize"" local agriculture.
* Step 4 : ???? 
* Step 5 : profit!!!

"answers","t5_2qkeh","You have to look exactly at what being ""rich"" means.  Fundamentally, you are ""rich"" if you have (or can get) a lot of useful/entertaining physical things, or if you can get useful services (airplane ride, internet access, a nice haircut, etc).  If the country just prints more money, and doesn't do anything to produce more goods/services, everyone will have more money but just as many goods/services as they had before,  i.e. they won't be richer.

That's the short answer anyway.  It's possible to temporarily increase production by briefly increasing the amount of money there is (i.e. by causing inflation), because everyone will feel like they have more money and will buy more stuff, causing more production.  Except pretty quickly there won't be enough goods/services and too much money, so the prices will rise and keep rising, throwing everyone's future plans off and actually causing economic damage.

Wikipedia's articles on [Inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) and [Monetary Policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy) are good starting points for more info.","1288569928"

The thing about Russell's Teapot is that, as stated below it in the counter-argument section, a teapot is a physical thing, Religion is an idea. You asked what my beliefs are, and my belief in religion is largely based on Moral Law, something a Teapot would never be able to explain the existence of.

To further answer your question about my beliefs. I do believe in a God, I read the Bible and I believe what it says is true. I believe that when Jesus died on the cross and was resurrected, he took the sin of Man with him, thus rendering the vast majority of Old Testament law no longer required for salvation.

I was first introduced to these beliefs from my family, but I didn't hold onto them strongly until had my doubts about them and decided to explore them deeper and independently. I read a lot about both sides regarding the existence, or non-existence of God. Two of the most influential authors for the foundation of my beliefs were [C. S. Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis#The_Christian_apologist) and [Dinesh D'Souza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_D'Souza).

I believe in [theistic evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution) and think [Francis Collins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins_\(geneticist\)#Religious_views) hits the nail on the head. I don't believe that God is a ""God of the Gaps"". I believe too often, Christianity and Science are scene as incompatible which I don't think could be farther from the truth.","1288569940"

Which leads back to the original points about the cultures being similar.  Sure, there are similarities, but saying that they are ""similar"" implies that there are more similarities than there differences.  If you can't even define culture, speaking in absolute terms like these is meaningless.

As a Canadian that has worked in Canada, the US, Europe and New Zealand, I can say that there are striking differences between Canada and the US.  So much so that I would argue they are very difference culturally.  I would also argue that I see more similarities between Canada and New Zealand than I see between Canada and the US.

Religion and other metaphysical systems are a game of telephone in which humans lose information every time they attempt to transcribe it. The problem is people who don't understand it yet continue to profess belief in it and attempt to teach others about it. 

Eventually they outnumber the knowledgeable and your religious senility kicks in. The issue isn't religion. Religion is incredibly-fucking-valuable to humanity. The problem is people who don't think and are okay with intellectual incoherency. Teaching people to replace science as their object of blind devotion does not teach people to think. Teaching the scientific method as a way to live is a start, but not the destination.

We simply need to realize that what everyone considers to be religion is fundamentally wrong and rediscover the actual meaning.

And to reemphasize and make completely explicit: Biblical literalism is fantastically irrational and should be abandoned by everyone after thinking about it. I am not opposed to science. I believe in evolution.

Seasonic is one of the best PSU makers out there - Corsair gets their PSU's from seasonic (except for some models that are made by another company - the model you have is made by seasonic I am almost positive). Good quality psu's have high amperage through their rails (3.3, 5, 12) whereas poor quality fudge the numbers of their total wattage and use lower amperage that will result in shorts if you put too much hardware in your computer. 

I am not 100% sure about the memory. So I'll wait to see if anyone else can post on this. 

I am not familiar with how hot the cpu will run at 3.4 on the i5 760 on a stock cooler. I found this forum post [here](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/262347-29-temps) where a bunch of guys OC'd a i5 760 to 3.4ish. They reported temps of around 75C at load. They all had good coolers. I found this other post [here](http://www.gamespot.com/pages/forums/show_msgs.php?topic_id=27444649) and it looks like if you want to go past 3.2 you should get a aftermarket cooler. 

In any case, why not wait till black friday? With some savings on the list you have - you could buy an aftermarket cooler.","1288570012"

I was socially awkward as a young kid, but around 14-15 I gained a ton of friends. Relationships and hook ups were the norm, except for me. It killed me all the time, and all I wanted was for someone to desperately love me. I was also concerned about being the only virgin amongst my friends. 

Here I am, ten years later, and I have this to say to you, don't worry about it too much. If you have the ability to make friends, you have the ability to attract a female. Trust me, I went from 17-year-old virgin to ""ladies man"" in about two years. 

I realized one day that it wasn't that important to get laid before I got to college, I assured myself there was plenty of women out there and eventually I'd find a good one. I also made sure I constantly talked to as many women as possible, attractive or not. I became friends with girls to help me speak to women I was interested in. That was one of my biggest hurdles. Once you realize talking to a woman you are attracted to is just like speaking to anyone else, male or female, than being ""smooth"" is a piece of cake.

Lastly, do something drastic to your appearance like growing out your hair/shaving your head. Change something about your lifestyle, like learning an instrument or go to local concerts. Force yourself to do these things to put yourself in new situations to meet new females. This proved to myself I was a whole new person all the time. It also gives you conversation material for the female prey you are stalking, that makes them melt like butter, so it's a win-win

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I do agree with you, and I did give you an upvote. I just wanted to be another one to point out that there are negative affects of drugs, **even at normally safe and tolerable doses**.

What I laid out is not a question of ""too much"" or ""too high a dose"" or even ""ridiculously stupid high dose"". What I was trying to say is that there really is no telling how every person is going to react to a ""normal"" dose (normal here meaning dosage levels advised by sites like Erowid.org and such).

I knew a guy who, after smoking a bowl of marijuana, claimed to see the ghost of his dead grandfather talking to him in a chair next to him. He also claimed to be able to hear all of our thoughts telepathically. We all smoked the same ganja and we had no issues at all, just him. Granted, this guy probably had some form of mental illness, but bad things can and still occasionally happen to people who **try to use responsibly**.

I guess I was just doing the devil's advocate thing.

It's always tricky to try to bring those subjects up in discussions like this **while still agreeing that banning drugs is not the answer**.

I hope I've cleared that up at least for you. I'd like to see most everything regulated. I'd like to see everyone provided with accurate information about substances and how they can **try** to safely use them.","1288570073"

FTFY.  The communism everybody is scared of is actually socialism.  The USSR was a socialist state.  Communism in itself is stateless.  This tends to confuse a lot of people, many who even consider themselves educated. 


&gt; just brushed over Marx at the end. 

Marx was not an standalone economist, so accordingly you likely would not learn much about him in an economics class. He is a political economist http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economist , which you would learn about in a class in politics or civics/government.  The others you listed also should not have been taught, that is just a bad education all around. But I was taught about Marx in HS, we spent more time on him than on Smith.


I don't think this needs to be taught in schools, people just need to take an active role.  Plus if we are going to teach it, solely left and right ideologies should not the only ones included.  Libertarianism/Anarchism and Authoritarianism should also be taught.

Unless the rest of your personal kitchen is sterile (very unlikely and unhealthy) the only concern is if you use your plastic cutting board to age freshly slaughtered meats at room temperature or cut past date raw chicken and only wipe it down before making a raw spinach salad...which you let sit on the cutting board for an hour.   **And** you are immunocompromised.  A cutting board is not a freakin' Infestor.  I dare you to show me a peer-reviewed report of someone dying from a cutting board who wasn't a formula-fed 4-month-old, 98, or experiencing terminal AIDS.

People really shouldn't heed the anti-bacterial marketing hype that's preying on fear to sell chemicals.  Bacteria and multi-celled organisms have been living together in relative harmony for a *very* long time.  It may be an uneasy peace, but it's not the EG finals.  Sure, there's the occasional bad seed, like a Muslim terrorist or a Changeling following your Marines, but a healthy immune system can handle it.

What scares me is the trend toward fearing our unicellular neighbors.  How long did our ancestors eat raw meat before we learned to use fire?  How long did we sit on dirt before we started bleaching our toilets?  Parents who don't let their children put things in their mouths while they are still breastfeeding frighten me almost as much as doctors who hand out antibiotics like candy for a simple UTI that could be cured by drinking more water.  Water!

I'm no microbiologist, but genetics is a hobby.  The tough part is keeping track of both the micro and the macro at the same time.

The best bit was that most of the IT staff knew he was full of it.  He had to give a progress report to the board or CxO's and was told to practice on us first.  He knew he'd get called out on his BS so got blind drunk before his presentation to us.  Even that didn't flag any warnings to the higher ups.

Eventually the whole thing became a farce.  In the last six months he wasn't even trying to produce the goods.  He was just throwing all sorts of lastest fad technology into the mix to add the experience into his CV.  At least he had some social skills - he jumped ship to IBM just as the whole thing was about to come crashing down.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","You say you ""feel like you're doing something wrong"", which is the real problem -- what you feel.  Artists have it hard enough without chastising themselves for invented infractions.

Take the following advice with a grain of salt; all that I know about you is in the seven lines of text at the top of the page.

It sounds like what you *want* to do (just make a song with presets that ""already sound great"") is being pushed aside in favor of what you feel *compelled* to do (make your own presets).  Compulsions are psychological issues, not musical issues.  Now if you take some time to think about it and eventually decide that you *like* making your own patches, then that is healthy behavior.

The most cynical interpretation of your post is that you're using presets as an excuse not to release your music.  ""I can't release that, I need to redo the presets.""  Everyone has excuses for not releasing music.  I'm pretty tired of it, and I don't really want to hang out on a board filled with people who never share.  I hope none of those people are you.

I remember hearing a story about someone at Oberheim who worked on synths that came back to them for repairs and maintenance.  He was disappointed that the vast majority of them still had the factory patches, only a small percentage of people modified them.  I think, ""screw that, most keyboardists don't want to be synth programmers.""

"soccer","t5_2qi58","I think that the MLS has a few players who can play for mid-table EPL teams and hold a first team place (like Landon Donovan, Thierry Henry now that he's old). But then there are a few players who get paid a 5-figure salary per year and would be Championship-level at best. So the quality is not spread out in the first XI, let alone the squad depth that will be necessary to survive an entire season.


Pre-season friendlies upsets of Championship teams beating Premier League teams is not uncommon. Also other teams from other upcoming leagues beating top-flight European teams in pre-season friendlies is not unheard of, for e.g. Tokyo Verdy beat Real Madrid [3-0 in 2005](http://china.org.cn/english/sports/136163.htm), when it was 17th out of 18th position in the J-League. You have European teams earning a nice paycheque to play in a friendly, looking to avoid pre-season injuries having travelled for more than 10 hours on a plane.

In my opinion the best measure of progress for MLS would be how many players get sold to the top European leagues and how they perform in the CONCACAF Champions League rather than mostly meaningless pre-season friendlies. ","1288570127"

"canada","t5_2qh68","I think the problem is this--if you disenfranchise the 'old' and 'enfeebled', it's a slippery slope. Who gets to define who's too old, who's too senile, or *[insert reason here]*? I feel like the subtext here is that *The Star* is saying ""well, gosh, this is the only way Ford could have been elected"" (at least that's the vibe I'm getting from this article), but the truth is that this is a rarity. And I'd rather risk letting a few senile old ladies cast a vote that never actually has an effect on the outcome than to exclude people from the system and thereby establish a very uncomfortable slippery slope regarding who gets the right to vote. If all of a sudden there is a massive influx of senile or mentally ill or confused voters, and they're actually tipping the scales, then that's a different matter altogether. As it is,though, I hardly think it's worth worrying about. As linkaz rightly points out elsewhere in this thread, ""Strictly speaking, adding any number of completely random votes won't statistically affect the outcome.""

Canada has generally--for a long time--had voting rights that err toward the inclusive, rather than the exclusive. And I think that's fundamentally something wonderful about our country: we'd rather allow a few bad apples to cast illegitimate votes than to deliberately disenfranchise a potentially much greater number of people who inarguably do have that right. It's a very Canadian thing, and I frankly think it's wonderful (and not just because I haven't had a permanent address in the last six years, but have still--as was my right, but which I may have been stopped from in a more exclusive system--been able to cast a vote).","1288570132"

"BarefootRunning","t5_2rp0r","First walk barefoot for like a couple of weeks.  Then start running like 1/4 mile, then add distance 10% at a time.  The quickest thing to change will be the bottom of your feet.  Soon those painful little pebbles won't hurt at all.  Then your calves will become a lot stronger and then your feet will reshape becoming wider and your arch will become more pronounced.  All of this takes time (at least 9 months) and it will feel so good it will be really easy to over do it.  If you push too far too soon your tendons/feet won't be ready even though your lungs and legs can, and you might injure yourself.  The biggest thing is changing your form.  You must relearn how to run.   You must listen to your feet and legs, if it hurts you are doing it wrong, either you have gone too far or more likely you are running with bad form.  You shouldn't get blisters, but you will until you learn to run with good form.

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","To be fair, the time frame in which Cobb is a fugitive isn't specified... and I've considered the totem dilemma.  Just because it was given to him doesn't mean it couldn't work.  If he received it while he was dreaming, then yeah, it wouldn't work on *that* level... but the entire point of the totems was so that if someone was creating a trap for you, as they did with Saito in the beginning of the film, the totem would be the one detail that they would have no way of knowing.

The architect in the opening scene screwed up by using the wrong material for Saito's carpet.  Ideally, only the totem would be an uncreatable detail.

That it used to belong to Mal, who is now ""dead"", neither proves nor disproves anything.

&gt;but this rule somehow didn't apply to Cobb and Saito (who missed all of the kicks, and somehow kicked out from limbo all the way to the plane)?

The film seems to establish that the only way to escape limbo is to die.  When you die in the dream, you wake up.  The caveat was that while under the effects of the more powerful stimulant, dying meant first going to limbo where you would no longer be lucidly dreaming and your brain might turn to mush by the time you woke up.  Cobb and Saito helped each other remember that they were dreaming, just as (presumably) Cobb and Mal helped each other when they were first exploring lucid dreaming.","1288570142"

"science","t5_mouw","This is wrong.  A ""medical"" dose of Desoxyn is usually 5-10 mg.  That's stronger than an equivalent amount of amphetamine (like Adderall, for instance), and I can tell you from personal experience that yes, you can easily feel a medical dose of amphetamine.  A ""medical"" dose of opiates gives you more effects than just pain relief too.  And, beyond that, you can definitely take a ""bunch"" of oxy and not immediately turn into a junkie.  I, and lots of people I know, have dabbled widely in various drugs, and I have to say no more people ran into trouble with them than would with alcohol or tobacco.  Usually less.  Arbitrarily saying that some drugs *can* be used responsibly for recreation and others *can't,* absolutely (like your ""moderate meth use"" comment) is a ridiculous generalization.  All drugs have a variety of risks and benefits.  Alcohol isn't special, or fundamentally any different than any other drug.  An objective assessment usually finds that booze ranks waaay up there with serious hard drugs.

Oh, and comparing an alcohol overdose to a meth one?  Think about the drunkest you've ever been (or, equivalently, the drunkest a pretty substantial fraction of the population has been).  Double that dose of alcohol, and I'd bet you'd be dead.  Take a serious dose of meth and double it, and you're (presumably) in for a horrible night, but you're probably not going to die.  Alcohol is way more toxic than most recreational drugs.","1288570147"

The point is if you you want to be serious about politics you should be able to make up your own mind.  Certain reporters like Olberman or pretty much every person on Fox condescend their opponents and want you to agree with them.  I prefer people who will still ask questions without promoting their own agenda.  In today's times I'd personally say Rachel Maddow and Anderson Cooper are among the best at that.  No one in their business will ever be 100% non biased but I think those two are able to disengage their egos from the interviews.

That all being said I'd say Fox is the only one to promote the conservative agenda but that's the problem in itself.  If it is a 'news organization' why would they be promoting a polarized view on politics.  Fox news is a theater and people love theater but when you do look for facts rather than entertainment they fall short by miles.","1288570164"

Quantum mechanics says that time and space behave very strangely at very small sizes (below Planck scale).  So near the beginning of the big bang, the entire universe was at this scale, and time didn't really have any meaning in the conventional sense. 

What I don't like about this explanation is that it amounts to an appeal to authority - the physicists who are working in m-theory.  It still beats religion though, because while it's hard to become a physicist, anyone is allowed to.

Incidentally, the planets/stars came from quantum fluctuations causing minute irregularities in the early universe.  This meant that matter wasn't entirely uniformly spread, and so it eventually condensed into stars because of gravity (and the stars went nova, etc.). That's an easy one. ","1288570177"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; All four of your objective sources use the word ""proof"" where you simply used the word ""evidence."" In fact, you didn't use the word ""proof"" at all. For the record, I didn't use the word ""proof"" either, so your objective sources are irrelevant.

Four of the six first bullet points used the word ""evidence"", furthermore, the [vernacular definition of the word proof](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proof) is, to give an example from one dictionary, ""The evidence or argument that compels the mind to accept an assertion as true.""

&gt; Bertrand Russell is implying that emotion is not evidence, which is absurd on its face.

If you read the article that is linked there, you'd see that Bertrand Russell is describing the type of ""faith"" that religious people usually have, and the type of faith that is often talked about in religious circles; that is, accepting something as true for emotional reasons rather than based on evidence or proof, or generally, logical reasons. It's referring to people who believe claims, specifically religious claims, because it makes them feel good, because they would like the claims to be true, because they receive emotional responses from believing such claims are true. Christians, for example, often speak of feeling Jesus or God in their heart. These are emotional reasons, faith based reasons, over evidence based reasons. This is what the article by Bertrand Russell discusses.

&gt; Richard Dawkins was categorically defeated on this point by Dr. John Lennox in their debate. Belief that isn't based on evidence is superstition, not faith.

The two are not mutually exclusive. Faith, as used in the context of religion, is a non-derogatory term to describe what is essentially superstition that is specific to the religion. The word ""Faith"" is seen as a more complimentary description. They are not all that different, however. Also, don't confuse this usage with the different kind of faith, which is placing trust in something or someone. I believe this is where your problem lies.

&gt; If you claim a fallacy of equivocation, you are begging the question.

There never was a question. The problem is that you are simply confusing different definitions of faith, which is already adequately explained in several of the links that you have clearly not read.

You are free to use the word as you please, of course, but the common definition and the commonly accepted usage in the context of religion is in that trust is placed entirely in the dogma of the religion. The claims are accepted ""on faith"" rather than on evidence. If that is not the definition you are using, then you must be clear, as you are differing from the commonly accepted definition.

&gt; You are substituting your own definition of the word 'faith' so it is consistent with the rest of your argument, and then using that same definition to discredit another argument by presuming they are using your same definition.

I never once gave you my own definition of the word faith. Every definition I gave you was a direct quote from a dictionary web site or well known author.

Furthermore, I'm not attempting to form some conclusion from a set of premises. I'm pointing out that the very definition of the word faith - one that you clearly seem to have missed somehow - shows that it is inherently irrational. It is so *by definition*. If you wish to reject these definitions, then that is fine by me, but you must understand that you would be rejecting the common usage of the word.

&gt; Oh, so it's self-evident?

No, I said it's obvious, not self-evident.

&gt; Like, for example, the existence of God to a believer?

No. That is usually accepted based on ""faith"".

&gt; You're contradicting yourself again.

Then you have failed to explain how.

&gt; See, it's about now that you normally expect someone to go running down the hall in tears because you've shaken their beliefs in the ""sky daddy.""

What's outside the universe?  The question doesn't even make sense, because it's not correct to say, 'nothing,' when 'outside the universe' doesn't even *exist* (as far as we know).

Except that the Big Bang is a theory, not a matter of faith. Also, it is subject to verification in the sense that we can make predictions and test them, even if we can't ever go back and time and observe exactly what happened.  So no, not like the Big Bang at all. 

&gt; I think that it gives an indication of intent and of abstract moral justification on the part of the evangelist. They have to see their beliefs as something unquestionably beyond those they preach to. It requires a religious bearing.

You seem to know a lot about the intents and motivations of people you don't even know. 

&gt; If we look at atheists as being individuals driven beyond their dogma

Do tell. What is the ""dogma"" of atheists? Is it documented somwhere? Is there some definitive guide?

&gt; while looking at Christians as two-dimensional facets of their message, we're creating a double standards that dehumanizes the Christians and places the atheists in a position where their religious pursuits are beyond question since they haven't treaded into ""religious"" territory. It seems like a dangerous precedent if we want to view human religious activity in a holistic sense.

You have yet to establish the ""religion"" of atheists. 

So far it has something to do with evangelizing even though it should be clear by now that evangelizism is not a primary component of religion nor is it even a good indicator. I can name a dozen things off hand that people evangelize, but wouldn't even come close to being religious in nature. 

&gt; I think your restriction of religion would remove many eastern and tribal religions from qualification and study as religions--

Maybe it would. So what? If they don't believe in deities or spirits and don't perform rituals in an organized manner, I have no problem excluding them as religions.  We have other classifications. 

&gt; and I don't see any excuse why Western Materialism can't be viewed as a religious belief.

You can view it however you want. I just don't think you're going to make many meaningful arguments coming from that position. Why don't we just call every philosophy a religion? Why stop at materialism? Why not call economic conservatism a religion? Why not call pro-choice a religion? Where does it stop?

After the coming defence cuts in Scotland (i.e. RAF Kinloss being closed), Scotland will have a smaller military presence than Ireland, which only spends 0.6% GDP. A good deal? I think not. We also wouldn't need to spend billions on foreign wars and Trident. And we don't rely on being British to pay for education, healthcare etc. Even with all the important economic levers being controlled by Westminster, we have a budget surplus, compared to the UK as a whole running a massive deficit.

2. Just the other day there were newspaper reports showing that Ireland, Norway, Iceland etc. still have a much better quality of life than the UK. Of course, in a world economic downturn, it helps that Norway has had an oil fund since 1995, which is now worth &gt;£500bn. The fact that oil is running out means that it will command a very high price. Imagine what we could do in your estimate of 50 years that Norway did in just 15? Also, would an independent Scotland have failed to regulate our banks in the way that London did?

3. Scotland currently doesn't even have a direct say in Europe. Tiny countries like Malta and Luxembourg do. We would have no desire to be some kind of world big-shot. And what good does being in the G8 do for the UK? Certainly not the highest quality of life for its people as I mentioned before.

4. Using the ""oil is running out"" argument against independence is like telling a young man that he needn't try to make anything of his life because he will die of old age soon. How do other small countries with almost no natural resourses manage to cope? If we became independent now, then we could invest the oil revenue in a fund instead od letting London waste it on illegal wars etc. Then we'd have 50 years to adjust.

I'd argue that financial success requires both the perception that success is possible, and actual available avenues for success to take place.  If either of those aren't the case, then success becomes difficult or impossible.  For that reason, you can't blame all of poverty on one or another, and you certainly can't blame poverty on the individual poor.

if its hot then obviously youll be swimming in the lake. if youre feeling more adventurous though, go here: http://goo.gl/eF6l - to the left of this about 30m up the river toward the lake is a great bank/ledge to jump off, about a 5m drop... jump in and float down the river to the rope swing - repeat. if youre not sure just ask the kids what to do

http://goo.gl/KZww : park the car (LOCK IT) and keep walking around to the left, follow the path for 5 minutes and you'll eventually reach the river. The water that flows under the bridge into the river is a thermal runoff, nice and hot, take few beers down (preferably Tui or Tui Blonde) and have a soak. If youre chicks I wouldnt do this at night unless you go in a group, it's pretty isolated

http://goo.gl/V2MY : Huka falls, nice short walk, theres a track that goes underneath the falls but its hard to find. Anyway worth a look

http://goo.gl/d8Zt : Orakei Korako, this is about 25 minutes to the North of Taupo. I think its a pretty amazing place. Theres a cafe here with a deck that goes over the river, if you throw crumbs in the river the tame trout will snap them up

things you might want to pay to do:

de bretts thermal pools (next to the hilton) - good place for a soak

float plane ride - http://goo.gl/zqpq - expensive though

It cannot *all* be explained by science. We have an irrational component. Science can acknowledge this component and even describe the bio-physical mechanics of it, neuro-transmitters and so forth. But there is so much more to us than that. A scientific description or explanation of our emotions (love for another person, for example) is like a scientific description of a Shakespeare play or the Sistine ceiling. It's not enough. I think that what science cannot explain is explained by the arts, myths, metaphors, analogies, visions. Everyone is inspired by fictional and mythological characters and stories. Religion is just another type of artistic expression and, as I noted earlier, a symbolic or poetic expression of human psychology. If only everyone understood it as such. Science is, indeed, great, but we do need other modes of expression. There is something about us which science cannot capture. Because science is not art. At least not yet.","1288570260"

"science","t5_mouw","To be perfectly honest, I think you're taking a very unclear stance here, and just want to disagree with me, but you barely do. Maybe you just misunderstood me, in which case, forgive me.

You started here with a ""what did you expect"" argument, which isn't very useful, but also happens to be represented by what I said:

&gt; and other topics, which (inevitably) become more circlejerks than topics worthwhile of real skeptical analysis.

So you agreed with what I said, but you elaborated more, focusing on the fact that you're not surprised. Well, neither am I, but not for the same reasons. Thankfully, I didn't elaborate on what I think are the reasons, because it doesn't really matter, because I'm bringing this up to encourage a solution to a problem we so far apparently both agree exists, and many others recognize as well.

&gt; One thing that does need to be done is to have moderating voices who are actual scientists who can control the ""science fans""

Yes! Exactly. I'm glad we agree on a solution, because I said that, too:

&gt;  ...from educated people, professionals...

I'm sorry I didn't make this my main point and talk about it at length, but since I did put it in there, it's assumed I meant it to be read and understood.

And you go on...

&gt; The recycled topics of UFO's, paranormal, vaccine, homeopathy and everything else? Those are still incredibly popular and prevalent beliefs that are absolutely wrong and easily disproved.

We stepped backwards. I know and mentioned that exact stance, too:

&gt; gets a lot of obvious FUD posted with no intention of investigating it, recycling a lot of UFO, paranormal... more circlejerks than topics worthwhile of real skeptical analysis.

We both know it's crap. Finding more examples of this crap doesn't make us skeptics.

Here's where we're finally talking:

&gt; I don't really care if you are bored with them and you want something new

I didn't realize it's up to you, and honestly, I don't care if you don't care what I think, and we've gotten nowhere again. You again state the FUD is bad. I agree.

So let's assume you care what I think, because you did reply to me, and you did make one valid point that disagrees with me:

&gt; By all means argue about what topics should be addressed in the skeptical community but the ""i'm bored with that one, let's find something new to disprove!"" stikes me as exactly the kind of skeptical masturbation you are disappointed with.

Skeptics are not out to disprove anything, which is another big identity problem /r/skeptic has.


I do think you got the ""I'm bored with that one"" part correct. We don't need more of the same article every damn day. Do you read all of these? Honestly? /r/skeptic doesn't even need to be posted to all that often, it just needs to be relevant to topics on which one can be *skeptical*.

If you don't recognize the annoyance and uselessness of repetition without action, then we just fundamentally disagree on that one thing, which is absolutely fine, but apparently (at least 37 vs 10) people agree with me, and we didn't need to go through all this to come to this conclusion.","1288570361"

You seem to have built a wall of wishes. You wish so hard that there would be some cosmic hippie grand purpose for humanity that you get agitated when your bubble gets burst. There is just no reason to believe that there is any grand design. I don't know that there isn't but in the face of zero evidence I don't bother dwelling on it anymore than I dwell on whether there might be leprechauns.","1288570362"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Science reporting (as in the science magazines and the ""science news"" sites and the media more generall) tend to overstress the newer, more controversial speculations over the more settled science (because that's what gets views, and hence revenue). 

It's good to keep up with the latest ideas, but it can sometimes skew perceptions about what's actually widely accepted.

There's some support for cyclical universe ideas from some very good phsyicists. It's not ""kook"" science by any means, but there are also ""non-cyclical"" ideas; e.g. many physicists think that time begins with the big bang. If that's the case, this universe has existed since the beginning of time, since the beginning of time *was* the beginning of this universe.

Some others think this universe ""budded off"" a pre-existing universe, that may itself have budded off another, and so on.

Stephen Hawking goes with our universe arising from the collision between two branes (in which case there should be mulltiple universes, all ignorant of each other).

I heard she went anyway and someone saw her crying there. I felt horrible about it. i was just scared of going to a social event like a school dance because i never went to one before. I basically wussed out and never considered how that would make her feel. I was actually the second guy she asked out though. The first turned her down.

To answer the ones you've asked:  
  
I had an interview with one of the recruiters for a job posting I saw and told them my situation, they liked my resume and basically took it from there.  
  
Housing is like the US, you can look on sites like gumtree.com.au (Australia's Craigslist) and find roommates or look at proper real estate sites for your own place.  
  
I wish I had a Bank of America checking account in the US instead of a Citibank checking account. BoA has a global alliance with Westpac so there are no ATM fees if you withdraw from Westpac. With Citibank, you'd think Citibank in Australia is the same as Citibank in the US but they're separate, so you get hit with an out of network ATM fee and then another 3% foreign transaction fee.

You've committed the middle ground fallacy.""  

The whole point of the middle ground fallacy is to show that that premise is false.  There are more than two positions to take, so depending on which two positions you are looking at, the middle ground will be different.  Therefore, the middle ground isn't *necessarily* true.  Arguments which rely upon that premise are therefore invalid.  Not necessarily untrue, but invalid.

Afterwards, though, I did head to OneLounge, and it was loads of fun but I was sad I hardly saw the redditors from that first group we had being with 'guitar guy'. I do wish we could have all bonded more; I was also sad that it took quite a long time to get there... I don't mean to be complaining cause it was awesome to be in the company of other redditors and thus pass the time, but since I and others were leaving that same night we spent a good hour just walking to the place.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Okay, once again you are bringing up a secondary issue.  There are a myriad of critiques applicable to Islam, that point is not in contention. 

The entirety of the scope of the issue at hand is (as made by you):  ""Islam and Orthodox Judaism are unique in forbidding interfaith marriages.""  

I would love to see some evidence that any religion that doesn't allow conversion (e.g., hindusim (in many forms), bahai, or druze) allows interfaith marriage or that conversion allowable religions allow without conversion (e.g., Bahai, christianity (even between many sects), Sikhism).  If you can't refute all, or even most, of those examples then it seems you have unfairly singled out Islam with a very inaccurate statement. Rather than continue to criticize Islam (your prerogative of course) see if you can either a) support your original claim as outlined above or b) admit that your criticism grossly over reached.  Not trying to force you into a false binary, so feel free to offer a c), but just think about how relevant it is to the actual issue at hand.

The rally had two big messages: First, stop listening to the fear-mongering newsmedia. Second, talk things over and work it out with those with whom you disagree. Thanks to the circlejerk nature of online discussion forums, as well as [Gabe's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/3/19/) the internet is not the best way to achieve the kind of civil debate for which Stewart is calling.

The Fuckward Theory is easy to avoid if you discuss things in-person, in the same room. I suspect that a great way to avoid the circlejerk problem is to start locally, with your neighbors, the people who live in your community.

In my mind, the most dangerous place to stand is in line waiting to get through security.

I think if/when I am in a situation where I am being asked to go through a body scanner I might just strip down to my boxer-briefs. I should point out that I am pretty overweight and have some decent bitch-tits. Now, I don't know that I would actually do this because it would take a lot of guts but I would like to think that I could go through with it.

The last time I flew neither airport during my round trip had implemented any full body scanners and I'm not sure when they will. I know I will be making the same trip for Thanksgiving and either of them might have them by that point.

I am also wondering where all of this TSA crap lands as far as the 4th Amendment is concerned. Isn't it reasonable that I expect privacy of my person and that society also expects that as well? If that is the case then the search of an individual person would require probably cause and a warrant to be searched.

The more I thought about it, the more impossible it was to come up with an answer.  And I had other questions, too.

My parents sent me to various religious authorities, but none of them could answer the simplest of my questions.  Like, why did god decide to come to earth as a human, only able to talk to a handful of other nearby humans, and ignore all the millions of people in, say, Asia? 

By the time I was 16, I felt totally confident that there's no god, and if there is, he wouldn't hold it against me that I used the brain he gave me.

''Of course,'' if it's the case that everyone else signed an NDA and refused to be tested, 8 might be all they could find and I'd be totally fine with them just explaining there are only 8 for that particular reason.  But the article doesn't really make that clear.  It might not actually be sensationalized, just premature.  But either way, I think it could be documented better.

By the way, another subtle way in which universal health care would be a win here is that games about promises to cover or make sure someone loses health care couldn't be used to extort silence out of people.  And when there was a problem that a lot of people were experiencing, the full force of government could be brought as the plaintiff since government would be footing the bill.

I know what he may say (the last thing he wants is to foster more decisiveness) but the rally was clearly inspired by Beck's (certainly the Redditor who first suggested the ""Restore Truthiness"" rally was directly influenced). At the same time I am also sure that this wasn't the only or even primary inspiration. The whole point was to counter the whole ""you aren't a genuine, patriotic American unless you agree with me"" rhetoric of which the Beck rally was one of the more prominent examples. Even the name ""Tea Party Patriots"" subtly suggests that their politically views make them ""more patriotic"" and those that disagree with them less so. It is sort of like  how certain political groups like to use words like ""moral"", ""values"" or even ""Christian"" in their names to similarly suggest that those disagreeing with them are somehow less ""moral"", ""lack values"" or are ""less Christian"" (in appropriate context) than they are.

Yes, most definitely.  If you look in the code, there's a themes directory, and what you're viewing is the default theme.  Themes are 100% pure css (with the option, usually discouraged, to override views if required), so Appleseed can look however a designer wants it to.

The trick with a default theme is to have a careful balance:  Make it decent enough so that people can and will use your software, but ugly enough so that designers immediately think ""I can design something better than that!""  :)

&gt;Do we want to be like France and make the poor poorer in the name of egalitarianism?

Nice rhetorical flourish but in France, the rich are also poorer.  There's also less disparity between the poor and the rich.  Studies have shown that is a good thing.  Almost no one in France would trade their system for ours, why do you think they've been rioting to protect it?","1288570552"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Ok This may or may not help but here goes:
One time, I was in a serious relationship for 4 years. Near the end, we NEVER had sex.. I mean ever. What happened was we grew distant, and me fapping away, made it to where I did not need her, nor want her in any way sexually. 
I was satisfied (barely) by my own actions and it became more of just a long term roommate situation. We even slept in different bedrooms. 
So when I came to stop wanting her in a physical way, I stopped wanting her in an emotional way. 

The only thing I can say is, being a guy, masturbation is not a bad thing in ANY way. But there is a point, when the immediacy of porn and other relief valves will be a detriment to your relationship with your wife or significant other. In fact, just recently, some fellow redditor had posted something about guys and porn relevant to this situation but I'm too lazy to search that out for you. Every man knows that there is a kernel of separation from you and your significant other when you watch porn (btw I'm extremely fucking guilty of this myself but I try to reduce my porn viewing time) and rub one out. Physically, you've been satisfied without her and that causes just a bit of distance. Repeat when needed, and this can be a problem.

Relationships take work. Fuck, they really do. But only you can decide if its worth it. (on that note I see girls on her all the time that I want, always thinking 'is this the best I can do?' when I go through my list of reasons *why* my girlfriend rocks, how cute she is, and she makes me feel. THAT part is fucking hard also.

Also, I think what she might be expressing is disappointment through anger at her own inability to 'be there' for you. At least that's what my now current gf (hopefully soon to be fiance) expressed to me when I told her I had 'taken care of myself'. 

Good luck.

Asserting that something is irrational does not make it so.

This is why you proof the tattoo for errors more rigorously than you've ever done for anything before in your life.  Everyone makes occasional typos in online discussion forums, no biggie there, but there's no mark of shame quite like a misspelled tattoo.

Back to your question: I'd probably vote for against the wings.  I think they'd probably look bad with the top and bottom bars in the GL logo and the alignment might be difficult to get right.

I should probably disclose that I tend to avoid all crossover comics, which may or may not influence my opinion of your tattoo idea.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I can think of two instances easy:
1. Hot Guy

Noticed he was hot the first day of class of summer term which was odd b/c he's not my standard 'type'. Second day of class he sits next to me, either b/c of my charm/good lucks or b/c he had a laptop and needed to be near an electrical outlet. We had good banter and partnered on some projects and cut forward to the end of term when in a fit of infatuation(hormones) I emailed him suggesting we go out sometime- never heard back. 

Two terms later we're in the same class again and this time I find him even MORE attractive... so I ask him to lunch. He accepts and we have lunch together and it's pretty enjoyable and only mildly awkward. A couple of days later I ask him again and he says no, too busy today. Meanwhile I'm doing stupid stuff like wearing fuck-me heels around a hilly campus and walking extremely slowly after class to give him a chance to catch up (in fact I dropped stuff a lot then too). At the end of that term I spent several days practicing origami which I was going to write my phone number on and then slip into his bag, or his pocket if i was feeling particularly brazen. Decided that I was being a bit too intense about the whole thing and instead when leaving the last class of that term I would be very upfront and ask/beg him to continue seeing me. 

Last day of class arrives and after class the freakin' TA accompanies us all the way to our cars talking the whole time. I didn't even get to say goodbye. I cried in frustration that night. 

Ran into him again over a year ago when I was sprawled on a couch outside of my thesis advisor's office flipping thru a trashy magazine. He says hi, and then wanders off into the sunset with all of his glorious hotness never to be seen again. ((Which is probably for the best as I'd lost all self-respect by that point)).

2. Beautiful Egyptian Man

I work retail at the mall and every so often this extremely good looking international student would come in. He was so good looking the manager walked into the stock room door she was so distracted and all of us that worked there broke at least one item whenever he came in. 

So one day my shift is over and I'm shopping at another store in the mall when in wanders Beautiful Egyptian Man. I say hi, and he says hi, and then I make some totally random vaguely flirtatious comment. He responds by looking nervous and then making a beeline for the other side of the store.

I'm ok with this outcome as I would have only been using him for his body and for supreme bragging rights at my store the next day. Instead I got to brag that I flirted with him- and that was almost as good.

By putting him on headlines they'll put too much pressure on him and it could turn bad because he'll get more attention from defenders. I even think that Berbatov is better for now, Berba is a killer but don't have enough chance to prove it especially when Rooney is playing alongside.

It isn't the users fault at all, it's the system, but lets not kid ourselves, it isn't like the money from the bottom doesn't make its way to the top. Sure, it's great that in some states there is now a legal alternative to buying marijuana, either medicinally or legally, specifically california, but in every other state, and even in the states where it is legally available with stipulations, people will still buy it illegally. 

I'm not morally blaming the user, or saying that anyone who smokes marijuana should feel bad that it might be funding the gulf cartel, but logistically, you have no idea where your money is going. Any good dealer won't let on if some stoner hillbilly is growing his stuff in some wooded area or if they're buying it from someone who's imported it.","1288570584"

The rain pounded on his windsheild.  The wipers didn't have a chance.

""Ah, shit,"" he said when he saw it.  A car stalled by the side of the road.  A lexus though.  Rich bastards.

His conscience got the better of his exhaustion and he pulled up behind them.  He flipped up his collar and stepped out of his semi truck.  Crap.  He was making such good time with an empty load.  

Two figures were bending over an open hood.

""Fuck,"" he muttered.  ""Kids.""

Two heads bobbed up.  Both with slender bodies.  Long brown hair.  In the light of the headlights, he saw one had brown eyes, the other blue. 

""Oh thank god,"" said the brown eyed girl.  

""We never thought anyone would stop!""  said the blue eyed.

And then he recognized them.  Mila.  Natalie.  In the rain and the dark he tried to cover up his shock.  

He kicked tires.  Checked the oil.  ""Well, ladies,"" he oozed, ""It's like this.  You're out of gas.  Your on a pass in the Rockies.""

He smiled.  ""And I'm a man. Just an ordinary man.  With an fill can of gas in my truck.  Maybe we can come to an agreement.?""

The girls looked at one another.  

He threw a couple blankets in the empty semi and turned on the overhead light.  The girls waited nervously.

""Ok, Mila,"" he said, ""Time to keep your end of the deal.''

Mila sighed and bit her lip.  She reached down and raised her shirt over her head.  Her black bra covering her large breasts.  Casio put his hands behind his back and looked.  

""That's a start,"" he said.  ""Natalie?""  He continued.

Natalie walked to Mila.  Tentatively, she reached around the woman and unclasped her bra.  Milas breasts rolled out.  Her brown nipples erect in the night air.

""Now you, Natalie,"" Casio said.  Mila lifted Natalies shirt, removed her bra and revealed her small, pert breasts.  The two girls shivered in the rainy, Idaho air.

Casio sat on the bench at the rear of the semi.  His prick becoming hard in his pants as he thought of what was coming next.  

""I think you first, Mila,"" he said.  ""After all, it is your car and the gas is your responsibility.""

Sheepishly, Mila shuffled to him, her C cup breasts swaying.

""Over my knees,"" Casio said.  Mila complied.  Casio reached down and slid her jogging pants over her round ass.  He rubbed his hand over the smooth skin, practically orgasming in his pants.  

""Count 20,"" he told her.  He raised his hand and let it land with a loud ""crack"" on her beautiful behind.  ""One!""  she cried, grasping at the floor.

Casio continued, reddening her ass with each stroke as Natalie waited, cowering at the thought of her turn.

"science","t5_mouw","Moral law - check. Yes, I do believe in treating other people well. However, like everything in life, ""good"" and ""bad"" are very subjective and fuzzy. I think it's a ""do-your-best"" game and hope for the best.

There is the notion that if god does exist, he doesn't necessarily exist in our four dimensional universe - that is, within our space and time. This is a fuzzy area of science, why I can't say for certain that there is no god. I just have no proof that there is a god either. There are also existentialist questions, such as ""if there's no god, where did we come from"" which is always countered by ""who made god"" but really, it's an inability of our minds to perceive infinity and anything more than the world that we live in.

I've given the link out to this series of videos in reply to a few comments (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12rP8ybp13s) so, apologies if I've already given it to you (I accidentally created a holy war, but the discussion is fascinating and really enjoyable). It, to me, is the best explanation of the whole nine yards.

How do you reconcile inter-bible contradictions, as well as aspects of the bible that are strongly contradicted by credible, peer-reviewed science?

Once upon a time, I was a southern baptist. I was raised in a religious household, and do know my scripture very well, even though now I'm an atheist-agnostic. Reading the bible was one of the nails that undermined my religious belief.

The other question I have, is are you happy being a Christian?

Denise didn't tell me because when we were dating I had been being respectful in regards to not rushing intimate relations, I was respectful to her decisions to wait or just make out. Then she went out and hooked up with her ex, parties, DID HIM and hid it. After we had begun having relations, HE bumped into us and dropped the bomb... and the lies came out... A bunch of betrayal and lies. I walked away... She chose not to tell me... When she did she said she had hurt me enough and wanted to convince herself that the man she was with after me was BJ's dad. Finally decided that wasn't fair and told us both, BJ and me.
go figure.

As for Dustin's mom... she was.. uh promiscuous ?! And her Grandmother who raised Dustin contacted me when he was 14. (mom was off doing her thing, Gma raising Dustin) Because his mother had the other possible fathers tested. When Gma contacted me, he was 14 and I was married and across the state.  I said that I was okay with her letting him know and that we could test too if needed, but I was okay with filling the role, glad to be his dad. Then things fell through and don't know why. I think maybe my wife at that time may have done some things, maybe intercepted mail or screened calls too, I loved my step daughters, but she wanted to have a baby and we were trying. So don't even know for sure if they are my biological for sure but I am okay with that, wanted to open the door and give the options.
Anyway... that's the additional info.

And I am sorry about the therapy comment, but with your comment.... ""I am not the one posting anonymously about the children I ABANDONED.""
I still don't get that ""leap"" to ""abandonment"", but whatever.  Now you have more info.  Hope that helps.

Couple that with the fact that a fighter can be down, receive a standing 8 count, and continue fighting.  In MMA, once the fighter is incoherent, it's over.

edit: I have to add that Serra's massive effort on religious people backfired as it was viewed as a desperate attempt to win votes, kissing saint statues was a little too much.

I agree, two meals a day isn't healthy, but if it's all you have to work with then, you have to work up from there. I'm not saying it's good, I'm not saying it's ok, but if it's all you can do, you can work up from there.

I'm assuming you're one of the ""redistribute the wealth"" kind of people. Let me ask you something, do you have a house? Do you have a car? Do you have a nice TV? Why don't you sell those things and give that money to the people in Kenya? Clearly they deserve it more than you and could use it for better things. If you honestly believe that these people are stuck in their situations, then why aren't you literally doing everything in your power to help them? I would argue you're even more cruel for sitting to the side and doing nothing but arguing that we should be giving them more money.

I understand people suffer, pain is a part of life. It would be completely unrealistic to expect people to never have to suffer in life. It's just something that happens, but if you try hard enough, you can get out of it.

I am honestly interested in your thoughts and opinions, but if you're just going to rant and yell and scream at me, you'll never convince me otherwise. All you've done is try to tell me how stupid I am. How is that going to convince me of your viewpoints?

Were this conversation in real life, by now I would have gotten up and just walked away. Please feel free to respond to my counter-arguments, just do it in a polite manner.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","hhmm.... well as someone in this industry as ""management"" to some degree i have an initial question to ask.

you say six figures -- but where are you located - east coast, west coast? i ask because money has different value based on location.  six figures in san francisco is quite differnet than six figures in the midwest.   

The other statment, and this isn't a criticism of you by any means - but I think you are way overpaid, which you may find does you damage if you move to a new company at any point.  2 years experience with C++ and you are in the six figure range?  thats nowhere near market value.   If you go to another company anytime soon you might find that salary cut in half.  I've interviewed people for roles where they were vastly overpaid in their previous position and now, they go to interviews with unrealistic numbers in their head.  One example that i can think of was a developer that based on an evaluation of their skills and code samples we would offer 45k to start -- they said ""but i was making 70k!""  -- whoever paid that person 70k did them a disservice.  

also - are you just a ""developer"" or do you have a lead role - tech lead or senior arch?

I know java senior architects that easily make six figures but that comes with solid enterprise skills and strong prior experience.  

I would also say that if you were to go into consulting for example, the consulting firm could not bill you out high enough to justify your salary --you just don't have the experience to do so.

So either stay where you are and make this kind of dough, or leave to get more experience - but expect a large pay cut.","1288570674"

There are some legitimate beefs to have with the Democratic party as well, which is why I can't side with liberals on a lot of things. Even the warrantless wiretapping programs and world policing you mentioned go on within the Democratic party. I'm pro abortion, but it kind of annoys me how the anti abortion people are portrayed as well - they aren't monsters who want to punish people for getting pregnant or ""get in your womb"", most of them are just well meaning people who think that aborting a viable baby is a morally unjustified thing to do, and I've heard some pretty reasonable secular positions people have taken in opposition to abortion (some of which I heard form Christopher Hitchens).

* Illegal to use rainwater to water your garden.
* Lots of fake signs (attempting to demonstrate no common sense). Some of these have been floating around for a while and they come from ""photoshop a funny warning sign"" types of threads.
* People over 65 being carded to buy alcohol.
* Kid was suspended for drawing a rocket.
* Kid was arrested and charged with theft for eating his friend's lunch. His friend gave him the lunch.
* 6 year old girls are on the no fly list. TSA harasses little girls.
* Woman's cooler raided by TSA, her food for her 93 year old (mother?) is taken, woman is arrested, leaving 93 year old lady sitting around goin ""huh?""
* Ron Paul supporters are domestic terrorists (old story).
* Body scanners, inverted images, blah blah TSA is humiliating, it's another way to keep people in control.
* People buying Toyotas are photographed to prevent money laundering.
* Paying tolls with bills over $20 requires photo to be taken.
* Raw/organic foods, illegal raw milk issues.
* Rawesome foods raid footage.
* S. 510 FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, would make it illegal to grow, share, trade or sell home grown food. Would put control of food under DHS and DoD. Already has 17 cosponsors.
* Executive order 10998 allows feds to take over farms during a crisis.
* During Great Depression, Congress passed Agricultural Adjustment Act, which paid farmers to destroy their crops in an attempt to artificially raise food prices. Increased the duration of the depression, which would have ended sooner without the act.
* Eat some rabbits, yum, cute and tasty.
* Coffee prices have gained 40%, food prices are increasing.
* Stockpile rice and beans, sugar, shampoo, toilet paper, etc.
* It'll be easy to make mortgage payments after hyperinflation, but it'll be hard to buy food.
* American Psychiatric Association is trying to create a new disorder, ""Healthy Eating Disorder."" ADHD and ""manic depressive"" are phony disorders.
* Drugs solve problems, not healthy food.
* FDA stops electronic cigarettes.
* Guy arrested for putting coins in parking meters.
* Police setup a sting to catch a guy who offers free rides to people who've drank too much.
* SWAT raids a guy who lets his lawn grow a foot high.
* Police camera pans away when cop beats guy for talking on his cellphone.
* Police check car doors, drop off pamphlets saying ""keep your car locked""
* Illegal to record cops.
* Jersey Shore is the cause of the problem.
* IRS physically delivers a ""you owe $0.04"" to a guy, after penalties, fees and interest it's $202.35.
* Local govt contacts woman who tries to start a house cleaning service without tax form.
* Police quotas are real, deliver your 5 seat belt violations, 5 double parking violations or get demoted and fired.
* Trial citizen investigators in San Francisco replace police officers as a ""cost saving"" measure, but it breaks down to $67k each for 6 months, which implies $268k/yr salary for police investigators.
* ""D"" grades are eliminated, students will get ""C"" or ""F"" only, so teachers will cheat so that it looks like kids are doing better.
* DeVry degrees are worthless.
* US Agency for International Development has launched a $36m training program for IT specialists in Asia who will be outsourced.
* Government pay is 20-40% higher than similar private sector jobs. After including health benefits it's closer to 100%
* Robert Rizzo, city manager for Bell California, was being paid $1.5M/yr. $845k/yr for assistant city manager and $770k/yr for police chief. Bell residents were all clueless and apathetic until these salaries were revealed by some reporters.
* Michelle Obama went on vacation to Spain for $241k (transportation, hotels, security).
* Treasury is accepting online donations to pay down the national debt.
* Electing democrats or republicans both results in expanding government.
* 3.7 Trillion spent to achieve 1.6% GDP growth.
* Friend's 94 Camry stolen because of cash for clunkers program. Because thieves need parts for older vehicles.
* Stamp prices have increased 475% over the last 40 years. Forever stamps are a scam.
* Blah blah fed govt will go bust or print more money to pay debts, causing hyperinflation. Social security checks won't be worth enough to pay for the gas to drive to the bank to cash them.
* iPhone 4 can be recycled into enough precious metal to feed a family for a week (post crash).
* No ""U"" shape recovery, Wall Street used bailout money to speculate for free.
* Home owners and RV owners duking it out in Venice. RV owners park across the street, pissing off people who own million dollar homes.
* Unemployment is record high, but economists say recession is over.
* Precious metals keep rising, Trust Us™.
* Government method to calculate inflation is flawed. Blah blah quantitative easing.
* National debt is 15x larger than it was in 1980 when Paul Volker raised interest rates to prevent inflation, so it's impossible for Bernanke to do the same.
* 57x more bonds purchased than gold. Gold isn't risky, dollars are risky, dollar denominated assets are risky.

So, yes, TL;DW is buy gold. But, there's a lot of interesting tidbits of info from various news stories that I didn't catch the first time around.

Oh, sorry, I meant to say and that is how it allows rape to be covered up. I keep forgetting about those silly catholics! 

People have argued with me, time and time again, that religion and a belief in god in and of itself is not harmful, so why should I put so much energy into giving a fuck about it?

I say to them and to you that religion fucking HURTS PEOPLE. It is used as a system of power and control. It indoctrinates children. This is the real world we are talking about here, at least it's what I'm talking about.

In the real world religion is in your face and abrasive; it is used to cow and control and abuse people in the middle east; it is used to form cults of money and power (scientology, mormons). Religion is no better than any fascist dictator. Even the fundamentalist christians here in the US are bad enough: bombing abortion clinics, stalling stem cell research, picketing my school after the shooting. 

I've said it once and I'll say it again: In the real world,

**RELIGION**

**HURTS**

**PEOPLE**

It is both the justification and the cause. The belief in GOD is not ""removed"" from all the awful things it causes. 

Belief and Religion are hand-in-hand with atrocities the world over throughout modern day and history. 

Edit to say that this is *truth* dude. This is *history*. Saying something like the Crusades don't matter anymore (to pick only one thing that Religion has caused/justified in that horrible incest of motive) because they happened in the past and, hey, was Religion REALLY at fault? is the **same** as saying the holocaust doesn't matter because it happened in the past, and hey, were the Nazi's and fascism REALLY at fault? They are intertwined. Fucking incest. 

To put it bluntly: when someone says Religion (as in the case of the Crusades) was just a *justification*, that is one part of the truth. This is what we, the modern people say. But there were plenty of men who fought in the actual Crusades who truly believed they were on a mission for god. Who fought *because* it was a mission from god. This is how religion is the *cause* of hurt.

It is all a matter of perspective. If you don't believe, Religion is a justification. If you *do* believe, Religion is the cause. THEY ARE THE FUCKING SAME. Religion. Hurts. People. ","1288570747"

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","no, i never said I bit my tongue and never use those terms.  in the correct contexts it is appropriate.  If I am quoting from Stormfront.com to show how racist it is, I will not avoid using the term ""nigger.""

My point is addressed to those who dismiss the idea that words are completely harmless and are not inherently evil.  Words are the capability to form thought.  If there are no words to convey an idea, then the idea cannot come to fruition.  Many times, words are invented to solely convey a specific idea. 
When American sign language was invented, there were no swear words invented.  No racial slurs, no insulting words.  However, it was learned that deaf people invented their own words to convey a similar idea in sign as ""nigger,"" ""faggot"", ""cunt.""

Some words carry no other connotation, or have been co-opted to the point that they are almost irredeemable.  Fascist will always conotate Hitler and Mussolini in the modern term, as it is so closely correlated to who they are and they ideas they espoused.  Though fascist was merely an authoritarian government who took a term from Rome to denote symbolic strength.  
Communist does not mean a socialist anymore, but the idea of a Soviet party dictatorship in the common usage.

While faggot at one time meant a bundle of sticks, or old ugly woman, it is now the almost sole usage of supression of human rights for homosexuals.  By carrying that word forward to mean a denegration of any sort of person still carries that same weight.  
So even by stretching the term to cover obnoxious people and not gays, it still is a derogatory term.

Once upon a time, nigger was an Anglo conversion of negro which means black in Spanish.  It of course was used to merely describe any member of a dark skinned race.  Yet who now would even use it in that term at all?  Nigger and negro in English has come and for the long term will continue to mean what we interpret it to mean.  A racial slur.

So, as long as there is one person still called faggot as a derogatory term, it will always have that connotation and carry that same weight, and continue to harken back to the ideas that it carries in its past.","1288570751"

Says it all... There were, of course, relationships like that in Ancient Greco-Roman but to say there was little in the way of equally compassionate homosexual partners is ludicrous. 

Also, the Bible condemns the act itself. There is no mention of the act within a specific social context - nor is one even remotely implied.  If we take the postulate that God is unchanging in his moral standards, then an act of abomination will always be an act of abomination.  Simple as that. 

&gt;one partner was the dominate, and it was considered humiliating to not be the dominate partner.

Not true in many cases.  Look up Greek pederasty. It was a mentor and student relationship.  To the Greeks it was considered as a right of passage - no dishonor in it at all.  

Also, this is beside the point.  You're arguing social inequality as not acceptable.  It was the *act* that was addressed and not the social circumstances that may have accompanied it.","1288570752"

"science","t5_mouw","[borrowed from The Blue Light forum]

Amphetamine tolerance is caused by excess Ca++ influx through the NMDA receptor gated calcium channels on the outer membranes of the dopamine cells bodies in the ventral tegental area, one of two areas in the brain with concentrations of dopamine producing neurons.
As alluded to above, taking an appropriate NMDA* (partial) antagonist will prevent the development of a tolerance for the effects of an amphetamine or amphetamine-like stimulant. Also, by preventing excess Ca++ influx into the neuron, an NMDA antagonist will prevent associated brain alterations and damage (excitotoxicity).

Studies have indicated that amphetamine tolerance is prevented by exogenous or endogenous agents that are able to inhibit excess Ca++ influx into the neuron through the gated calcium channels on the neuronal membrane that have NMDA subtype glutamate receptors.Glutamate , the body’s major excitatory neurotransmitter, opens the gated calcium ion channels upon attaching to the NMDA receptor. A number of other receptors are also expressed on these calcium channels, which, when stimulated, either facilitate or inhibit glutamate’s action.

It is also important that agents that inhibit calcium channel activity not also cause deficient Ca++ influx. For example, ketamine is a full NMDA receptor antagonist, that prevents excess Ca++ influx and amphetamine tolerance. But being a full NMDA antagonist, ketamine in excessive doses results in deficient Ca++ influx. This could be one of the reasons it leaves K-user in a state of disassociation.

Magnesium is an NMDA antagonist. Most people are deficient in magnesium, and stress reduces magnesium levels. Whether or not one takes amphetamines, magnesium supplementation is very important for mood, general well-being and keeping stress levels under control. It is also important to take magnesium in efficient form, with adequate bioavailability. **The best type is magnesium glycinate (chelated) with bioavailability at around 80%. Second best is magnesium carbonate with (I don't remember exactly) bioavailability at little above 30%. Supplemented magnesium should be at 500 mg/day level**. Also there is a study which shows that children who use amphetamine-type stimulants have bad magnesium/calcium balance. Calcium levels stay the same with amphetamine usage, but magnesium levels drop.


* The NMDA receptor is a receptor for the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is the most important excitatory transmitter in the brain. It is not only a receptor, but also a channel (it is thus a ligand-gated ionic channel). N-methyl-D-aspartate is the famous agonist of the NMDA receptor, the latter being named after it. It is a very complex and fascinating ligand-gated channel that seems to be involved in the toxic effects of excessive glutamate, and in many other processes like synaptic plasticity and target recognition.","1288570785"

Cobb was the only one of the crew who'd come back from limbo (arguably, his wife never really ""came back""), but at **no point** does anyone say that Cobb's reality is where everyone goes.  Limbo was described as a state of pure subconscious where you could get lost inside of yourself and go mad.

Limbo is only shown as a sort of raw beach, a blank canvas.  You fill it with whatever.  Mal and Cobb filled their reality with an intricate city and massive buildings.  Saito populated his reality with that Japanese-style house where Cobb is taken.

In the film, when Ellen Page and Leonardo DiCaprio enter DiCaprio's level, the latter is the architect.  What they see is the world that Cobb created with his wife while in limbo, **but it is not actually limbo**.","1288570797"

There are many things that can go wrong when you're trying to do your best to be as ""fair"" as possible.

Here are a few things I can think of, mostly derived from a bit of knowledge of scientific research and peer review. You should find a representative sample, and report in similar proportions. That would probably mean getting someone else to create a list of all the people managed by that landlord (even those without phone lines), and randomly pick people for interviews. You should pass your interview questions to a psychologist to filter, and make sure only those questions get asked. Questions should not be repeated. Full transcripts should be made, excluding any answers that are not related to the asked questions. You should report on the transcripts, rather than the interviews, and certainly not your own memories of the interviews. Provide links to transcripts, and references to transcripts within the reports so that people can look at the context and evaluate whether a particular point of view was valid. In other words, make it as easy as possible for someone else to do the same investigation that you did.

The person who is choosing the interview has some sampling bias. The person doing the interviews can introduce their own bias, even unconsciously, through the questions that are asked, the facial expressions used during the interview, and other things that I'm not aware of. Reporting can be biased, especially if you get punished for a non-story -- this includes being the second choice for the next big scoop.","1288570849"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had a very, very extensive crush on a guy in high school. It started Sophomore year, and after enough friendliness and spending most of the day together (we had all the same classes) for over a year, I finally decided one weekend to ask him out. We had a uncharacteristically deep and personal conversation over IM on Saturday night, and it took all my effort to not ask him out right there, but I managed to withhold because I wanted to be classy and ask him out in person.

Sunday evening rolls around and I'm giddy with excitement about asking him out the next morning. Before heading to bed, I decided to check my facebook out of habit, and there it was. In my newsfeed, I saw that his relationship status had changed. To dating. My worst enemy/ex-best friend from elementary school whom I hadn't spoken to in years.

I pretty much died. I was completely crushed and cried for days. Months passed and they remained together. We remained friends, and I pined. Over another year later (senior year at this point) they were still together and I decided that I needed to say something, so I confessed my long-standing love for him as we drove around in the dark for three hours. He confirmed that had I asked him out that Saturday, he would definitely had said yes. I still can't help but love him.

College comes, and we end up at the same college. He's still with Spiteful Bitch. I finally decide four years is too long to pine for someone and start pursuing a relationship with someone I met at college. The day after my new boyfriend and I go official, he breaks up with Spiteful Bitch.

I've taken it as a sign from the universe that we should never be together.

TL;DR- I missed being able to date my four-year long crush by twelve hours. *Twice*.

It's much easier to define murder, theft and physical stalking than it is to define trolling. And we could all get tickets for speeding: so what you are saying is we should all be convicted of ""saying harsh things"" every now and again to keep us in check? Who has the resources for that? 3 letter agencies can barely tie a timestamp and IP address together to a location and you want them to be giving us points on our internet licenses for being nasty to people? Of course I'm extrapolating here but you see what I mean.

&gt;There's a plate on you that identifies who you are

And criminals trivially falsify or remove said plates when committing crimes, or use burner vehicles to commit their deeds. Insecure wifi is everywhere. Free internet access is everywhere. VPNs and proxies upon proxies mask the identity of 13 year old 4channers aiming LOIC at the latest raid target, what makes you think it's going to be any different for the real ""trolls"" once they realise that the police might have an interest in them?

&gt;For now. Too much anonymity

I don't know about you, but that is a good thing. You can google ""gigitrix"" and find out anything you like about me, but what makes the internet great is quite simply the anarchy of it all. Would we have powerful utilities like Wikileaks without it? Cyberspace is the wild west compared to our suburban meatspace. With this, every man has the potential to change the world, from Mark Zuckerburg to Julien Assange. I hope with all my heart that it can remain that way.

I have seen two 'software engineering' programs, but they were both offered by the engineering department and included a lot of electrical engineering and less programming.

On the other hand, I think good design is more of an art and not something that can really be taught, so I'm still a bit skeptical. You can be taught and memorize all of the common design patterns, but knowing when and how to use them is a skill you either have or you don't.

Also, my school's software development courses were taught by a grossly incompetent professor and focused more heavily on things like UML than actual design. I was completely disgusted by the course, so I'm now permanently biased.","1288570919"

The warning here is that people who follow the rituals of the false prophetesses are being prevented from worshipping correctly and thus they are damning themselves.","1288570964"

Personally, I don't have a problem believing the Bible and evolution are true. A lot of Christians want to take everything literally, but I don't think that's the best way to read anything. And it's certainly not good to read something a certain way to prove my own point, while shutting out scientifically proven things in the process. And I fear that's what a lot of Christians do.

Instead, I should read with context in mind. I try not to read anything at face value, unless that's what the author intended. The author of Genesis wouldn't have scientific tools or discovery on his side given the time it was written in history. (Sidenote: Christians get all excited when a speaker puts something Jesus said in the context of his culture, but all too often scorn it in the case of the Creation Account). The Genesis account reads like an epic poem, so I think that reading it and not taking it literally is appropriate.

I think people like to make issues black and white in terms of reading the Bible. It's a lot easier to say *everything* is to be taken literally than to discern what the writing is actually trying to get across.","1288570970"

However, the rally did not speak out against the idea that holding a ""radical"" opinion is wrong. The rally was not about ""the middle ground"", as the middle ground between sanity and insanity is still insanity; but rather, the rally spoke out against the those who seek to suppress intellectual discourse through the use of fear, the use of hate, the propagation of misinformation, the demand for anti-intellectualism, and willful ignorance. 

The rally was about encouraging people to reach positions rationally, *sanely*, as Stewart put it, instead of simply focusing on these red herrings and one's opponents. It had nothing to do with discouraging positions that are considered ""radical"", or discouraging positions which are considered ""specific"" or ""strong"", or even encouraging positions which are considered ""moderate"". 

I may disagree with creationists, I may think creationists are insane, and I certainly don't respect the idea of creationism, but I do certainly not hate creationists; I am certainly not willing to lie to beat creationists; and I am certainly not hiding from creationists in my own ignorance; I am more than willing to talk and discuss with creationists, and that is the kind of rational discourse the rally is promoting.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","It's funny. Ten years ago, I might have said the same thing. Then, I became involved with a man who was systematically domestically abused throughout his entire marriage by a woman who used this exact method of control. Once you read one John Saul novel, they're all the same.

I am not a rich woman. I make a modest living and SO and I are raising a blended family, so money is tight. I'll bet you EVERY asset we hold that his girlfriend has Borderline Personality Disorder. I don't know her from Adam but I can call it from here because they all play from the same damn book!

During their relationship, she has presented as alternately erratically cheerful and depressed... more depressed lately, mind you... but somehow, the depression is always his fault. She hooked him with a ton of sex, but now, a little bit of the way in, there isn't much sex anymore and it's a biiiig, giant chore done with a grimace and a sigh and her face turned into the pillow with the lights off. She's depressed, she's stressed, she's going to quit her job and take a break and maybe think about looking for a new one in a few weeks once she's had a bit of a rest. (Don't worry, that's not EVER going to happen.)

She's got the guy, she's got the apartment, and she's tired of rearranging the furniture and buying stuff at the dollar store so she's bored. A baby! A baby will fulfill her! A baby will fill in that empty spot that the awful boyfriend was supposed to fill... that horrible... abusive boyfriend... don't know why I stay with that guy... he's such an ass... he doesn't understand my needs... a baby will fix that. So... I can do the sex. A couple of times a month, I can do the sex. Spread your legs, give him a smile, turn off the lights and bite the pillow. And then a baby and 18 years of never working again, and a baby who will never ever let me down.

To you, it's a simple sex question. To those of us who are trying to heal the men who are abuse survivors of marriages to women with Borderline, this is the first chapter of a horror novel, when the hero is going down the dark staircase and the audience is screaming, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!""

What is going on in the real world is not what you are talking about,  and all the public works projects and tunnels,  unless they create energy self sufficiency or consumer goods self sufficiency (at globally competitive prices),  are just going to kick the can down the road without reducing aggregate debt.   What inflation really is, is covert taxation,  covert transfer of wealth because increased taxes are off the table, and have been for decades.   Only it won't be the workers that benefit with flat wages but wealthy speculators (bubbles anyone?).   When the rest of the world decides not to use dollars as the primary global currency,  the US empire will fall like Britain did when the British pound was debased and lost world currency status.    US workers have been on a downward spiral since the 70's as a result of voodoo economics and also thanks to gullibility on the part of the majority of the voters.

Unless you're a very thin girl, mens saddles are going to be too narrow, and your butt bones won't make contact with them at all. (does your saddle feel all up in your business? that's why.)

You won't have to buy a specialized saddle (although they are quite nice) but you'll know how many millimeters your sit bones are apart.

 When you buy a saddle, take a ruler with you (yes, I'm the dork who does this). Make sure any saddle you consider is wide enough. That should be the #1 consideration. After that, it's up to trial and error to find out how much padding you prefer, this that and the other. 

Bottom line, nobody can tell you what saddle works for *their* butt and expect it to work for yours. (The 143mm Selle San Marco Aspide and the  143 Specialized Toupe work for me. But, that's just me.)

If you work for certain charitable organizations, it's shortened from 25 to 10 years. My fiance is in the process of consolidating all her loans for this, as they need to be a certain type of loan.

I realized pretty quickly that lines are different from songs and speeches, and got a little bit of stage-anxiety as the performance approached, but they were only little butterflies. I was 14 at the time, and the final performance that year fell on my 15th birthday.

My mother was very apprehensive about my participation in such an event at my age, but I was insistent and promised that I wouldn't perform anything overtly sexual (menstruation was a perfect topic for my age, even though I had gotten mine 5 years earlier at 9).

Anyway, enough rambling. :) I love hearing about other people's perspective of VM, simply because every time it's performed it is so different. Each year I've seen it it's almost like a different show.

Also, we did get a lot of fixes for SMP. Redstone works, positioning glitch stopped, lots of other issues were fixed. All very important but frequently brushed off.

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","&gt;The film seems to establish that the only way to escape limbo is to die. When you die in the dream, you wake up. The caveat was that while under the effects of the more powerful stimulant, dying meant first going to limbo where you would no longer be lucidly dreaming and your brain might turn to mush by the time you woke up. Cobb and Saito helped each other remember that they were dreaming, just as (presumably) Cobb and Mal helped each other when they were first exploring lucid dreaming.

I have thought of this, but it seems to be at odds with the emphasized importance of Ariadne having to get out of limbo (via kick) in time to ride the other kicks back to reality.  Why didn't Cobb just kill her and Robert?

I am going to watch this movie a 3rd time when it comes out on video.  I noticed a lot in my second viewing that I had missed in the first, and it seems to warrant another yet another viewing.  Such seems to be the case for so many of Nolan's movies, IMO.","1288571150"

If I find the healer healing the eager DPS and them continuing to pull, I wait for combat to end and then I quietly port out of the dungeon using the little eye on the map. It usually takes a few minutes for them to notice. When they do, I say ""Oh, I'm sorry, the way you were playing I thought you didn't actually need a tank.""

Insults usually start flying here about how much of a scrub I am and how bad I am and how I need to L2P and how much they don't need a tank... and then invariably they pull too much/pull the boss and die. Then I start mocking them. There's always one member that goes ""Can you please just come back and tank for us"" to which my answer is always ""No, I don't see the need in trying to tank if you guys won't let me.""

I wind up getting removed from the group, which is my goal (and fuck leaving myself, I don't see why I should wear 30 minutes of not being able to do anything just coz the DPS don't think I'm needed) and I can requeue and be off again in seconds.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The circles on that map don't match the pictures.  

* The glen beck picture ends at the WW2 memorial, whereas the circled area extends all the way to the washington monument. 
* The stewart rally photo at least extends down to the front of the Hirshorn museum (the circular building on the bottom right) which is between 7th and 9th--the lower border of the image is probably 9th street--but the circled area stops at the front of the National Gallery of art, which isn't even 7th street yet. 

From the images you provide, the Stewart rally comprised a larger portion of the mall than the Beck Rally. Moreover, from the image you provide it looks like there might even be more to the stewart crowd than is contained in the image you gave us. This is also corroborated by reports from friends who said they were as far back as the natural history museum, which is past ninth.

**tldr**: OP did a shitty job

EDIT: additionally, it needs to be taken into consideration that the perspective on these pictures is different. Both were probably taken from the top of the washington monument. The wasington monument is significantly closer to the lincoln memorial than to congress, so the Glenn Beck picture is taken from a larger downward angle than the Stewart picture.  The smaller angle for Stewarts rally results in a condensation of the perspective relative to the Beck picture. This is fun!","1288571208"

If you think Ford talks too much about money, and just money, perhaps its because you're young.

Old people can't compete in the new workforce, so if you go broke when you're old, unless you have some in-demand skill you're pretty much screwed.  You can't get a job when younger people work faster, learn faster, and all for less money.

If you go broke at 20, you just crash at a friends place, or move back in with your parents.  You don't have a mortgage, and you don't have kids (hopefully).  You don't have any health conditions, and you still have time to learn a skill and bounce back.

The older you get, the less chance of bouncing back you get.  That's just how it goes.

Old people don't give a shit about environmental issues (at the municipal level anyway), because nothing Toronto can do will have any impact on the environment when China is starting 500 new coal plants a year, and so paying unnecessarily high taxes for some green-initiative, when that money could be paying for some pills that aren't covered by OHIP ( and keep in mind 1 in 2 men develop cancer in their lifetime ), paying for those solar-cells on top of schools seems like short-sighted bullshit.","1288571239"

* We don't make our own ""stuff"" and have to import other people's engineering and technology this leaves us vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and cost rises.
* We don't know how to manage water and can't agree on what it will take to do so in a way that is sustainable.
* 18% of cancer is from infectious agents and we don't have solutions to most of them. At least 30% of cancer is from bad lifestyle choices and we don't have an effective way of causing people to understand this and change their habits.
* We will soon have many more old people that need care but we can't afford to look after them because the work is often nasty and the pay is so low that people will not put up with the down side of the work.
* No matter what we do we are a tiny country and much bigger countries are hell bent of ruining the planet.
* Education costs more than it should because a text book or a lecture in electronic form should only cost cents to distribute but our system is so commercialised that this is not possible.
* We no longer live like natural humans and our lives have been so heavily influenced by corporatism that it is harming our mental on physical health.
* Not being religious is not protected by law in the same way Religion is.
* We do not have human rights as a full legal right.
* Our leaders are allowed to tell us lies.
* We do not have enough affordable good quality housing, that will last a long time, and that incorporates well know sustainability and energy efficiency principles.
* Our society is structured in a way that forces us to move around in vehicles more than we should and this wastes time and energy, yet paradoxically we are less able to move around on foot or by other physical means, which is bad for our health.

Well, then I'm afraid your ""dictionary"" has a rather fuzzy concept of the word proof.  Evidence is not proof.  A compelling argument is not proof either.  By the way, vernacular definitions are not found in the dictionary.  The vernacular and diction are two entirely different things.

&gt; If you read the article that is linked there, you'd see that Bertrand Russell is describing the type of ""faith"" that religious people usually have

In other words, he's begging the question.

&gt; Also, don't confuse this usage with the different kind of faith, which is placing trust in something or someone. I believe this is where your problem lies.  

I don't have a problem, my friend.  I'm not swapping definitions of faith every time I make a statement.

&gt; There never was a question.

I'm sorry.  We seem to be arguing on entirely different educational levels.

&gt; but the common definition and the commonly accepted usage in the context of religion is in that trust is placed entirely in the dogma of the religion.  

I'm sorry, but your latest definition of faith is not familiar to me.

&gt; I never once gave you my own definition of the word faith.

Then you cannot credibly claim the fallacy of equivocation.  

&gt; I'm pointing out that the very definition of the word faith - one that you clearly seem to have missed somehow - shows that it is inherently irrational. It is so by definition.

Once again, you've contradicted yourself.  One paragraph prior to this absurdity you claimed you weren't providing a definition of faith.  Now you go on to claim that faith is irrational by definition.

There are really way too many interesting topics in computer science to make them all mandatory.  Most programs have a certain mandatory core, and give you a high degree of flexibility in deciding whether you want a more theoretical or applied focus, and even specializations within those.

Most of the people in this thread seem to think that anyone who doesn't take the exact courses they took is half-assing it and not really a computer scientist.  Not even the theoretical mathematics community is that dogmatic.","1288571258"

While I agree about Iraq, Afghanistan is not so clear cut. While the country is still massively fucked up, the strategic goals of destroying Al Qaeda's training operations were objectively well achieved. While obviously it didn't stop extremism from existing it struck a significant blow to the leadership and operations. 

Also I agree 100% on the greens, while agree with most of the social policies e.g. gay marriage, drug enforcement, asylum seekers etc, they have with in the party a not small proportion of members with decidedly socialist (and I mean in the Marxist sense, not in the Sweden way) ideology in regard to economic policy. This leaves them unelectable in my mind.

There is one thing I do agree with them though, is that a carbon tax is the most straightforward and fair way of addressing climate change. The libs policy isn't really anything and the ETS, aside from having far too many concessions for big polluters such as coal power, does more to produce profits for the finance industry than it does for tackling climate change.

I don't think this is necessarily true. On the scale of an individual life, I would suggest that the lifetime of a once-living organism ultimately created greater entropy in the Universe through a process of consumption, waste and ultimately death. While it might be the case that at present, we as living beings on Earth are entropically ahead of the second law of thermodynamics (because more life exists now than did across all time in the past), ultimately this pattern must end in finite Universe and we must repay our entropic debt to the Universe. In this way we can see evolution as a kind of thermodynamic [ponzi scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) which ultimately fails when the economic input (read, ""energy"") required to sustain the scheme exceeds the economic input available. (Note : This does not mean life will ultimately end. It just means there must ultimately be more entropy through death and waste created than order through presently existing life).","1288571266"

&gt;Women's constant rejection of such a self-evident fact [ie the difference in sex drives -ed] doesn't help at all. Whenever I point out to my women friends they instantly deny it; they will claim to be regular masturbators; they will claim that the idea of a good anonymous fuck is a real turn on; they will claim that only the other day they saw a man whose bottom reminded them a little of Mel Gibson and that they got really quite juicy thinking about it. *Only the other day?* What about only the other *minute*? What about every damned sodding bloody minute of every bloody damned sodding day? Don't they see that women should pop open the champagne and celebrate the fact that they are not slavering dogs like men, they should revel in the biological luck which allows them to be rational creatures who can think about the benefits a partnership with a man can provide, who can think about motherhood and work and friends... who can just plain *think* unlike us poor bastards who spend days that should be spent in work and higer thoughts having to realign the sore and swollen cock under the waistband of our underpants every time a set of tits walks by? Of course women get the itch every now and again, we wouldn't be here as a race otherwise; of course they have the genital equipment sensitive enoug to ensure that sex can, when embarked upon, cause shiverings of pleasure, barks of delight and all the dirty rest of it. But they are not, lucky, lucky, lucky things, for ever *hungry*, for ever *desperate*, for ever *longing* for the base physical fact of getting their bloody rocks off. I mean, the fact is, it's five in the afternoon as I write this, and I've already tossed myself off twice today. Once first thing, in the shower, and again just after lunch, before sitting down to this. Any honest tart will tell you, sympathetically, like a nurse, that men, poor dears, just have to spit their seed. Why women should wish to claim parity in the matter of this gross imperative beats me.

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","interesting.. honda's are my specialty.. what is this person asking for the car? 

The #1 thing you should look for is that the block should be stamped B18c or b18c1 on the left side right about center on the block, right next to the transmission bell housing. If it is stamped b18A or B18b, walk away.. its not a gsr. To fit that valve cover requires a vtec head, so you might be OK, but you don't want to buy someone else's LS Vtec setup, cause they are notoriously tricky to do right and will have head gasket issues if done wrong. 

Wiring is another place i would look, as a few others have said. Also make sure it uses Hasport or AZ race machine mounts as well as the corresponding shift linkage, and not some home hack job. I am not quite as familiar with the ek b swap, so my guess is that its a mix of stock mounts and custom mounts, hopefully bought from hasport or other reputable swap mount makers. Hasport mounts are easy to spot as they are a big chunk of machined billet aluminum. AZ race machine does some that are pieces welded together, but they are always powder coated and won't look like a hack job. 

He isn't running the stock GSR manifold either.. which means he may be running a p28 using the LS intake manifold to get around dealing with the GSR throttle body secondary problem. Its fairly common, but the stock GSR manifold flows better, so you are going to be down a little hp.. 

Check to see that the ECU matches the engine.. a GSR engine should be using a P61(rarer) or P72(more common) ecu. If they are running Hondata, ectune, neptune, or a host of other aftermarket honda computers, then the ecu tag may not match if it was converted, but they should be able to tell you what basemap they are running and what management system it is on. My guess is that since it isn't turbocharged, and since he is running the LS intake manifold, he is probably running a p28, which would need to be running modified map to run that engine correctly. Ask him what engine management software the car is using and who tuned it. Its certainly not the end of the world if the ECU doesn't match, but i would want to know who did the tuning on it before driving it much. the p28 ecu which is likely on there, is made for a 130hp sohc vtec d-series, while the p72 is made for the dohc vtec b-series at around 180-200hp, so the maps are hardly ""compatible"". If he says it is running crome, it means he did it himself. Not a big deal if he knows what he is doing, but you may take it to a tuner to make sure its running ok in all RPM ranges. 

Lastly, i would look at the wiring harness conversion. See if it was back converted to OBD1 using a conversion harness, or if the wiring is spaghetti.. if it was converted using a aftermarket wiring harness, there should be a bunch of grey wires coming out from the engine harness and connecting the ECU. If it is ob1 swapped, it also should have a orange and blue pair of wires you can jump together to make the CEL come on. Check to see if the car is throwing a cel before buying it, and check to see what its going to take/cost to fix. 

You also should check that it is running 2 O2 sensors properly, and not just one wired to look like 2, if the car is running a P72. The p28 only requires 1 narrowband O2, so if its running a p28, you should see only 1x 4 wire o2 sensor. 

You have to be prepared to do the work yourself, as most honda dealers won't touch a swapped car. Some of the techs may offer to do work on it on the weekend, but then you don't have a warranty or insured labor working on your car. 


Anyway, from what i can see, i would probably consider paying anywhere below about $4k for the car, depending on how good the body is. I would pay less if its running crome, or if there is a CEL, and also if the mounts were custom jobs. If the mounts are custom, i would look at getting a hasport kit which is about $400 or so, which means the owner would have to come down on the price. 

The only reason i wouldn't buy it is if the wiring was not converted using a Rywire or equivalent wiring harness, or if the block is a b18a or b18b without the paperwork to prove the builder was of high pedigree and capable of doing the build right.  the wiring should be easy to see right away by taking a look where the ecu is mounted on the passenger side door area and looking for a rywire style harness. 

if you have any questions, let me know..

When I went to military school, one of the things they did to ""help"" the community was hire people with mental disabilities. Thus, a lot of the groundskeepers and kitchen help were mentally handicapped.

One of the guys had...a problem with girls. Since this was the 80's and other FAR worse shit was going on there, I guess he seemed alright. But in retrospect he was not. I ended up going to community college a few years later and he was still there...trying to be a massage therapist.

All he talked about from the time I was 12 was using massage as a way to get in with ladies. He was absolutely convinced.

Now, when I think about your problem and the massage therapists I know and have used, I have to say that your problem pales in comparison to the absolute creepiness of the groundskeeper at my old school.

If you wanted to be rich, you wouldn't do massage. Hippies who like helping people, working under the table, doing things informally, etc - it draws that kind of person.

As an example - when I was moving my house from Vancouver to Montreal, I stopped to see a guy in Bellingham. I was so screwed up from the moving he absolutely refused payment. He wanted me to not suffer and be able to do my work. He was a hippie and he was bisexual...very lonely as well because his partner had some recent issues and was gone. And 0% do I think he had any ulterior motive.

Your guy, if you put him between the scale of the two I mentioned, where does he land? Think about it. And ultimately, if your guy tries something on your lady, she's a big girl and has to deal with it. And if she's that easy or you think that little of her...better off without her or it explains why she'd be open to it.","1288571329"

"aviation","t5_2qhu8","If apprentice, doing it properly, would take longer than school. Granted school costs money, but you will likely make little if anything apprenticing. I suggest school. I believe most programs hover around 18 months +/- a month or so. I went to A&amp;P school in 2000. Have been an A&amp;P for almost a decade now. I also took avionics training and now own a small company specializing in all things avionics for the GA and small corp world. I love what I do (most of the time). I would not suggest getting your A&amp;P to make a career out of it, but if you have a love of aviation and wish to do it because you are an owner then all the more power to you.

That said - beware, having an A&amp;P will allow you todo most every task on your aircraft, but will leave you short of the experience and skill required to do most of the ""heavier"" jobs. MANY small aircraft owners do most light maintenance themselves ""Under the supervision"" of an A&amp;P. Pilot/Owners are also granted some limited rights to perform preventative maintenance on their own aircraft which actually emcompasses a large scope for an airplane like a 182.

If you wish to pursue a career in corporate aviation, being an pilot and an A&amp;P opens the door to many small corp flight departments who like having their pilots also being A&amp;P's. You generally do little maintenance but you are expected to know the systems of an aircraft and manage the maintenance. I had some friends in A&amp;P school planning this route and it can be a GREAT path if you are at the right place at the right time.

FAA regs regarding owner preventative maintenance, see paragraph (C):

Then they did it women only, which came to about 56 seconds, then men only, which was about 54. Last, they wanted to know what would happen at the middle when the wave started from both the back and the front of the audience (it crossed in the middle and returned to both ends).

Next, they put up text on the screens which would cue the audience what sound to make. They included polite laughter, mad scientist laughter, crying, silence, and cheek popping (I think those were all of them!). They would cycle through them.

They then tested how severe the shake was from everyone in the rally jumping at once.

While I wish I had an anti-conversion moment by the side of the road to remember with great fondness, I'm pretty happy with the longer, gentler path.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I actually have this same problem....I apparently come off as a ditz to people who first meet me.  Those who stick around to get to know me realize I'm not, thank God.  But then there's those who are alienated on the first meeting...  A teacher even announced in a class I was in that he thought I was an airhead till I sent him an email about classwork, and he realized (from the way I write), that I'm actually intelligent -_-  It was kind of a backhanded compliment to me.  An old friend I had before once said that sometimes the things I say sound so simple and far off, but if you think about it, what I said was technicallyh correct (this was in regards to talking about things like oxidation in indigo dye, osmosis, things like that).  EDIT, another example from college....I got accused of plagerism by a Lit teacher; compared to the way I speak in person, he thought I couldn't possibly have written my essay.  After crying and fighting and telling him to run my paper through those plagerism programs since I have nothing to hide, he gave me an A on that paper 3 weeks later.

It bothers me that people think I'm a ditz when they first meet me...I don't know how to get out of it either...I also played dumb in middle school and high school (to be accepted by my friends there), and can't get out of it.

EDIT:

I wanted to say, it's not even that we don't know trivia and facts and scientific theories, am I right?  We know this stuff, we're smart, we went to school, we read.  But it's how we PRESENT ourselves, our attitude when meeting people that makes them think we're dumb.  What comes to mind as an extreme example is Christopher Langann.  He's got an IQ of 195 and has thoroughly digested tons of facts and research papers, yet people never took him seriously in his life.  Why?  Cause of his attitude; he's got a very regular-guy attitude.  A friend of a friend heard him talk in an interview, and this friend of a friend refused to believe Langann has a 195 IQ because the way he talks is not very eloquent.  It's not what you'd expect from a scholar.  So, that's what I think is my problem, and probably the OP's as well.","1288571384"

This is of course just speculation, but Bush politicized EVERYTHING, and politics would likely have played a role in such a decision here as well. Would it be okay if Bush took these same actions for the greater good, as Obama did? Sure. Would it be okay if Bush took the same actions because Karl Rove told him it would bring him more votes from the weapons manufactures who would profit? Not by a longshot.

Christmas Day, Tikrit Iraq, 2004.  My platoon and I had been in Iraq for ~9 months at this point and for much of that time we had been broken up into our radar teams (5-6 man teams) and scattered all across the country...radars aren't very useful when they're right next to each other. Anyway, I had recently been brought back to Tikrit to take over as the NCOIC (guy in charge) of combat logistic patrols in Tikrit (escorting shit trucks and whatnot from the main post in Tikrit to the outlying posts). For whatever reason, right around xmas, more and more people from my platoon started showing up in Tikrit until finally there were something like 27 out of 35 people there. It was amazing. There's nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your best friends/brothers after a year of being apart. We stayed up all night playing Halo 2 (which had just come out) and eating this amazing caramel and chocolate slathered popcorn that some church had sent us cases and cases of.

Tara air flight to Lukla - $220
It was my highschool friend and me, we had a guide and a porter. It was a 14 day trek and our cost included the guides, lodging and all food and it was $900 per person.

You could easily do this trek on your own if you are strong. I would say that if you are 'somewhat fit' - yes, ok maybe you can make this trip but certain days are rather strenuous. Trust me that last day of hiking we hiked 12 hrs and I was missing the other 50% of my oxygen I'm used to big time.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","I had some ideas about how relationships with women work. I learned them by listening to what women said they wanted. But I learned the hard way, I was sadly mistaken. What women said they want was not what they really wanted. I learned that when my beautiful, feminist PhD college professor friend said that what she wanted was a guy like me, with my qualities, and then she ran off with a homeless drug dealer and became a homeless crack whore.

What PUAs know has been tested by sociological field research on tens of thousands of women. They didn't listen to what women said they wanted, they merely noted what women actually responded to and then figured out why it works. But then, PUA techniques probably wouldn't work on you. They are intended to help men enter relationships with *quality* women, not bitter feminist harpies who waste their lives lashing out at men on internet forums. 

I will reiterate: we do not listen to women that tell us what they want and how we should behave. It is well established that women are unable to communicate what they want. It is a man's job to lead a woman and show her what she really wants. Once I learned that, my relationships with women improved a thousandfold. ","1288571446"

Close all her credit card accounts.  Check her credit report weekly (you can subscribe to something for $10/mo or so I suspect).  Take her name off your checking account.  Close her checking account.  Etc.

You give her cash to spend and a list of things to buy.  $100 a week or so.  

Every day that she is not working is a day that she needs to vacuum, cook, mop the floors, do all the laundry, wash the cars, mow the lawn, take out the trash, and take care of all the kids needs.  You make up any list of things you want done, and she does them.

Call her on every lie.  If she says/does anything that doesn't add up or does not meet your needs, you call her on it.  You punish her for it.  You take away her car keys.  You lock out the internet.  You put parental controls on the TV.  You lock up whatever it is she wants.

This isn't about her lying - in my humble opinion - this is about you being a pushover and letting her get away with it.

Might I suggest you purchase the book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" by Dr. Glover.  It may (will) help you understand how to better react to this situation in a polite, mature, and responsible manner.  (No, it won't make you into an asshole).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The new Nookcolor is neat because it has the option of the backlight with color for web-browsing complete with a touch screen (so basically a tablet), but at the same time you can switch all that off to save batter and take advantage of electronic ink for actual reading that works *better* under sunlight (instead of glaring like a laptop) and will not strain your eyes.

So this one is kind of like the best of both worlds, between a Kindle and an iPad.  Also, Barnes and Noble's protection plan covers accidental damage like water spills or cracked screens from being dropped.

Also, Amazon's prices are now set by the publishers instead of Amazon, so though ebook prices are generally still low, they're no longer nearly always $9.99 like they used to be.  Nooks can read any book for free when in store, and you can ""lend"" books to other nooks for 2 weeks at a time.  And because Nooks have a touch screen at the bottom (or all of it in the case of the Nookcolor) they're not quite as clunky and seem easier to use.

Edit: ALSO, Nooks support all kinds of files, including PDFs and Word documents.  You don't have to just buy from B&amp;N.

TL;DR: The newer Nookcolor has the e-ink that saves your battery life and your eyes and reads just like paper PLUS the *option* of the backlight and color touchscreen for web-browsing. You can get books for free in PDF files etc., and the Nook will support them.","1288571496"

"science","t5_mouw","What is your background in developmental bio/embryology? Well here's a mini-lecture on it. I don't believe in evolution--belief implies acknowledging something w/o supportive evidence; I KNOW evolution is true. But this phenomenon is not a mistake or imperfection--it is merely life; neither a point for evolution nor intelligent design.
When I first learned about the recurrent laryngeal nerve I thought, man that was stupid you got the right recurrent hooking around right subclavian artery and the left hooking around the arch of the aorta coming back up to innervate the laryngeal muscles. Why would a nerve ever ""linearly"" develop by traveling all the way down then back up again--totally inefficient, should have been selected against. 

But you know what? The nerve didn't actively grow like this, it was **passively shaped** to take upon this path. When you first develop your primitive heart tubes from the cardiogenic region, they're actually located rostral (anterior/cranial) to your oropharyngeal membrane (your mouth) approximately where your neck is. It's only after embryonic disc folding where the cranial fold displaces the cardiogenic region down below the neck where your current heart sits. During this folding process, the primitive heart tube drags along incidentally the developing neck nerve that is to become the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and thus once the great vessels (aorta and subclavian artery) developed, the nerve remains hooked in its place as we see it. It JUST SO HAPPENS this nerve was dragged along.

To declare that this phenomenon was a mistake would also mean to suggest there should be consequences from this mistake. And yet, there are none. No Creator made a ""mistake"" and evolution did not fail to select against this ""mistake."" It is merely, life. I remind us all that as humanity learns to understand itself and the world, many things appear as unreasonable or imperfect to our understanding. The problem does not lie within what we observe, the problem is of our paradigm of understanding. Who knows, in the future maybe we'll discover that the recurrent laryngeal nerve's path serves a purpose in shaping the arching of the great vessels? Until then, rather than calling it a mistake or imperfection, I like to just say it is an event of life.","1288571514"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","Well, behaviour that we now understand as mental illnesses would have been classified as possessions.  This is a very big topic, so I hope you'll excuse me if I give an ancedote instead:

Mental illness is actually a topic that touches very close to me, as my mum became mentally ill.  A church convinced her that she was possessed and they spent a year trying to exorcise her.  She got steadily worse, and, well, I had a shitty childhood.

Eventually my dad stepped in and she was sectioned in a mental hospital.  There they tried various drugs, and she got worse.  But then there some new breakthroughs in understanding of her particular illness, and some new drugs were available.  It took a while to get the dosage right, but it worked wonders - she became my mum again and was released.

Fast forward 10 years, and she was still doing well and taking the medicine.  The doctors wanted to try to slowly take her off the medicine to see if she can cope.  She relapsed completely and immediately.  The plan was cancelled, and she's now back on her medication and in full health again.

Now does this disprove possession in this particular case?  I think you can reasonable argue so, because why else would she respond to medication?

But does this disprove all possessions?  No, of course not because you can always argue that /this/ mental illness wasn't a possession, but someone elses is.  And indeed this is the official Catholic Church position.

But this is the God Of The Gaps again - possession has been pushed back and back as science shines its bright light.  Possession can only survive in areas that are currently not understood, and move on once they are understood.

---

As for sin - this can be easily explained by evolution through natural selection.  To divide it crudely, on the one hand you have the ""normal"" sin, which is what almost all of us have the desires to do.

The desire to gain an advantage over our fellow man has a clear evolutionary advantage.  If you steal from neighbour and that makes you survive when he doesn't, then you'll have kids and he won't.  Thus your genes for selfishness are passed on.  In practise it's not /quite/ that simple, since we are social animals and rely on the co-operation of our fellow man.  Thus we have developed more of a Tit-For-Tat strategy using a ""conscience"" to enforce it.

Then there's the more exotic ""sinners"" - the rarer people who are psychopaths etc.  Here we can actually see defects the genome or in the brain.

To take one example, there was a guy who was normal average day guy.  Then one day he climbed a tower with a rifle, and shot and killed a whole bunch of people before police managed to shoot him.  They did an autopsy and found a tumor in the front of the hipocampus, in the part that drives rational thought.

Now does that make this guy a sinner?  If this tumour had been removed, he would not have killed those people (there have been other cases where this has happened).  It's hard to argue, afaics, that this sin was caused by ""the fall"" instead of a tumour!

"comics","t5_2qh0s","I agree. The ending was indeed ambiguous. And that it's either an ""Edgar Allan Poe"" ending, where the protagonist is simply driven crazy by guilt (or his jealousy, to make things even more complicated). 

Or everything is indeed supernatural. I think the lilac plays a huge part in this. At the very beginning, the protagonist describes his brother as having a way that makes people trust him, and also owning a lilac bush. Then when they went out to hunt the ""beast"", it revealed a few interesting parts: the brother immediately volunteers to hunt with him, the mysterious hole smells of lilac, the brother so readily claims that it had only always been just a wolf. So I think the brother is the beast. Whatever that evil thing was, it possessed him. Even before they went hunting, the brother was already the beast.

Conclusion:  man-made GHGs are responsible.

In a world older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear.

When there are cars that get 30+MPG, the upgrade from 10 MPG to 12 MPG seems fairly unimportant... except that it saves you 0.17 GPM, the same as going from 30 MPG to 60 MPG.  Upgrading your gas guzzler to not be quite so thirsty (but still bad) is just as valuable as going from a car with good mileage to one with excellent mileage.

The issue isn't really about comparing multiple cars driving the same distance, it's about understanding what any given MPG/GPM means for *your* car over the distance *you* drive.  MPG distorts your reckoning because you have to invert it for most of the ""obvious"" calculations to work properly, and most people can't do that easily.","1288571628"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","there is no ""normal"",because everyone is an individual, hence ""safety is relative"".  

it is exactly because there ""is no telling"" what it may do to someone, until they have tried something, that it is incredibly irrelevant to deny other people's choices based on some individuals experience. i don't like honey, shall we deny honey from everyone else, or shall we make honey clearly labeled and information available to educate the people it effects?  

&gt;Granted, this guy probably had some form of mental illness, but bad things can and still occasionally happen to people who try to use responsibly.  

your friend is the only one that knows himself enough about what is best for him *according to his beliefs*. outsiders can only do what they believe is best according to what they believe he wants. if he had a bad experience, he obviously started taking too much from the start and would have been better off starting smaller. if he thought he was ""normal"" like everyone else, then he is the retard that we should be aware of because he will be the one to fuck himself up at our expense when he itches to others, or other people take it upon themselves to intervene ""for the good of all of us"".  

this is the scientific method. you start of with probability within what you know and you increase your knowledge such that you can use the feedback from your actions to decide what next to act on. your friend thought he was like the rest of you, so he did as the rest of you did. he made a mistake and had a very different experience, if he learned and still wanted to try in the direction of weed, then he could use the feedback from his mistaken first attempt (where he thought it was a good amount), and he could have taken a much lower amount to see where his personal ""sweet spot"" was.  

whatever his experience, it should be no reason to deny other people the *choice* to try the same potential as he.  if he doesn't learn, it is up to him as an adult, or his friends and family around him to care for his choices and try to help him do what they believe is best. but ultimately it is his choice and you can't force people to be happy, or do what *you* believe should make them happy.  yet that's what we have laws doing exactly right now.  

i'm happy that you want to see people being responsible more for their choices, instead of the state. i simply wish you  were more decisive about whether you cared enough about the  subject to more seriously change things for the better, instead of satisfying your personal needs to play devil's advocate for your own short-term gains. having a desire to play devil's advocate is a counterproductive behaviour that is neither helping spread awareness in educating people for the right to choose their own lives, yet you say you want things regulated.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","As for (1), belief in the scientific method isn't really an argument from authority.

Perhaps you mean, you believe in the scientists, and you do that *because* you believe in the scientific method.  This is very reasonable, and I commend you.  There seem to be too many people (at least in the US) who think that their opinion is of equal weight as experts.  In fields like economics, where there seems to be no consensus about things like whether the economy will get better or worse next month, this may make some sense, but that's not so in science.

Your ""belief"" in the scientific method is *NOT* the same as belief in a deity, because the scientific method has a proven track record of generating knowledge.  Science practiced today is a self-correcting method of producing and refining descriptions of reality that *actually work*.

If there are disagreements between scientists about things, well, you better know what you're talking about if you're going to say things one way or another.  But if there's broad scientific consensus, it's as reasonable to have confidence in evolution as it is to have confidence that we know how to correctly make electricity and make light from LEDs.

If you'd like another alternative to evolutionism and creationism, check out Rael.  The dude believes life on earth was engineered by aliens (whose voluptuous female robots entertained him on their spacecraft). He's got some serious followers who believe we should clone humans to follow in the footsteps of our progenitors.

As for (3), well, thanks for using logic.  It seems to be a better method than anything else for figuring stuff out (see above!).

In other news, lots of pop books on evolution, if you're interested.  Dawkins seems to be a fav here, but there's lots out there if you look.

I thought about putting an ad in the spokane newspaper asking if anyone knew them.  Describing names, relatives, etc. and not saying more but offering email address or my phone number for help or tips !
Something like that?
Anyway again thanks for the feedback !

However, although the story is true per se, the book was in fact the result of a long and arduous creative process. Kerouac carried small notebooks, in which much of the text was written as the eventful span of road trips unfurled. He started working on the first of several versions of the novel as early as 1948, based on experiences during his first long road trip in 1947.

"toronto","t5_2qi63","It's all relative. Toronto winters can still get pretty hellish for extended periods of time, especially compared to other major world cities. There comes a point where people are just barely willing to live in certain climates, and I would say that Toronto fits in that comfort zone the majority of the time whereas Winnipeg is right on the edge and too extreme to attract a significant number of immigrants. I'd say that a temperature low enough where people can DIE after 20 minutes of weather exposure without wearing an ugly parka practically suited for Arctic conditions is pretty reasonable to complain about. Toronto's geography is pretty flat as well as being right next to the lake, so the damp, high-speed air can create a pretty nasty wind chill which tunnels through the city's grid-like street system. If you visit at some random time during the winter, then it's really hit-or-miss and you could leave with the impression that Toronto's fairly warm, but being a humid continental region leads to a LOT of variety in temperatures so it's hard to predict what it's going to be like from day to day and it's easy to underdress.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;If tomorrow I can make a car better than I can today then obviously it's going to cost more money.

I know that's what you were indoctrinated to believe, but it's utterly false.

Here's solid proof (using your own example subject):

&gt;The standard [Ford Model T] 4-seat open tourer of 1909 cost $850[29] (equivalent to $20,513 today), when competing cars often cost $2,000-$3,000 (equivalent to $48,267-$72,400 today);[citation needed]  in 1913, the price dropped to $550 (equivalent to $12,067 today), and $440 in 1915 (equivalent to $9,431 today). Sales were 69,762 in 1911; 170,211 in 1912; 202,667 in 1913; 308,162 in 1914; and 501,462 in 1915.[24] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.[24]
&gt;
&gt;By the 1920s, the price had fallen to $290 (equivalent to $3,258 today) because of increasing efficiencies of assembly line technique and volume. Henry employed vertical integration of the industries needed to create his cars.  ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Price))

&gt;Inflation also encourages investment and reduces our liabilities in real terms making it cheaper to pay off debt. 

Actually, it does nothing of the kind -- what inflation (aka debasement/devaluation) does is *push* people to engage in risky speculation in an attempt to maintain the *real* value of their savings by getting a *nominal* return that will be equal to or higher than the inflation (a thing which is much more difficult to do on a continual basis than it sounds, and which is, by definition impossible for all currency holders to accomplish).

---

&gt;Inflation is not a bad thing in and of itself.

Bzzzt. For savers and currency holders, inflation most certainly **is** a *bad thing in and of itself*. (The only real beneficiaries of inflation are the first recipients of the inflated currency, at the expense of those who are on the far end of the latency {typically wage earners and those on ""inflation adjusted fixed incomes"" -- whose increase by definition follows after the inflation has taken effect in the remainder of the economy).

The thing that is NOT bad in and of itself, is *deflation*. (As illustrated not only by the example of the Ford Model T above, but also by the entire computing industry during the past several decades -- where productivity increases have been so phenomenal that prices have consistently dropped even while the functionality of the units has significantly improved -- and even still the supposed ""downside"" of an ever decreasing price does not seem to have disabled the industry at all {in total refutation of the standard dogmatic claims of economists}).

You need to ditch the acolyte like regurgitation of dogmatic econ-speak theology, and take a look at the REAL world.","1288571743"

First, if you haven't already, get a fresh tank of gas; eliminate crappy gas from the equation.  Run a can of Seafoam with the new gas.

The fuel pump either works or it doesn't. If you get good flow with an underhood check then it should be able to pump enough fuel for higher RPMs.  

How's the timing belt?  M20's have been known to jump a tooth, leaving the ECU trying to compensate for full retard.

What you describe sounds like BMW's fuel cutoff (which you hit after redline or 155mph).  It could be a bad anti-knock sensor as well, or a condition that's causing pre-ignition at those RPMs triggering the anti-knock circuit.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The 'surge' at the end of 2007 was because the caucuses and primaries were approaching, starting with Iowa on Jan. 3.  If we look at the coverage of Obama, Clinton, Paul, Edwards, and Mccain we get this picture,

http://www.google.com/trends?q=barack+obama%2C+hillary+clinton%2C+ron+paul%2C+john+mccain%2C+john+edwards&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=2007&amp;sort=2

Notice how the media coverage for all of the candidates increases at the same time.  Look at John Mccain, why didn't John Mccain's popularity increase proportionally to his media coverage?  

Now, popularity in searches does not equal popularity in reality.  The same goes for the number of youtube videos, it does not equal popularity, it could just as easily be a measure of controversy or just a function of how much each candidate campaigned online.  the lack of media coverage could also explain why more people searched online for Ron Paul; they were not getting enough information from the media, so they searched online.  This does not imply popularity.

Finally, remember, correlation does not imply causation.  Did Obama get more coverage because he grew in popularity or did he gain in popularity because he got more coverage? If we ignore the fact that search popularity does not mean real popularity and that there was a reason for increased coverage, we still cannot conclude, based on this data, that the media attention caused his popularity or that his popularity caused the media attention.  The information only tells us that their 'might' me a causation.","1288571755"

"math","t5_2qh0n","So, I got my undergrad in math and am planning to do graduate work in the humanities.  While I don't agree with the author's reasoning, I do think that he's right.  The focus of mathematics education has been on quantity over quality, and as a result, application has taken precedence over the aspects of a good mathematical training that can actually help every-day people.  Our general math education focuses on knowing as much math as possible, but not knowing it well.  I can honestly say that the majority of the people I met in AP Calc in high school were probably never going to apply it to anything they'd have to do in real life, but it was still seen as a boon to them because they'd taken 'calculus.'

Math education would benefit society to a greater extent if it instead focused on techniques over total knowledge.  I think society could trade the number of people who know what 'dx' is (but don't really know what dx is,) for those who could provide a proof of the infinitude of prime numbers or something similar.  Math teaches you to disregard all non-essential assumptions, to identify spurious logic, and to form a rigorous argument which actually makes sense.  Imagine if we had a society who actually knew how to tell that Glenn Beck's chalkboard logic is full of shit.  Instead, we have a bunch of people who've learned a castrated version of mathematics to ensure that they can recognize as many mathematical terms as possible, but who couldn't tell an ad hominem attack from a contradiction.","1288571784"

Although the cypher was cracked by Poles in 1932, and the Polish-made replica of the Enigma was brought to England in 1939, they were still unable to figure out the changing cyphers from the German side, and on average spent two months deciphering messages. The capture of the German submarine U-33 of the coast of Scotland led to a working 5-wheel Enigma machine falling in the hands of the allies, unlike the three-wheel replica of the Poles, essentially meaning that the allies were able to eavesdrop on the *Kriegsmarine* again, as well as Army and Air Force. 

The capture of code books laying out future cyphers, amongst others from the trawler *Krebs*, as well as the capture of the U-110, provided the British intelligence with materials needed to reduce decryption time to anything from 1-6 hours on average.

tl;dr - Vital Polish understanding of how the Enigma cyphers worked, **plus** code books and intelligence captured by English sailors and several others, made it possible to eavesdrop on the Germans throughout the second world war, decoding more than 1,1 million of the 1,5 million intercepted messages of World War II.

"politics","t5_2cneq","There is an us vs them, though, as unfortunate as it is. There is a very important distinction between the two dichotomies, though. The one, in which there is a right and left America, insists that there is only one truth; that to disagree is treason, is insanity, and that you cannot be trusted with even an opinion unless you agree. 

The other says that there is a rational America and an irrational America. But this isn't any single person, or any group; it is a **state** that oneself, or one's group, or even the entire country can find themselves in. This rationale says to embrace ALL viewpoints, *as long as they are based on sanity and reality.* Rather than the destructiveness of the above, we see encouraged an acknowledgment of the existence of contradictory truths and opposing-yet-competent views; and an ability to shift between the two states (or for the state to exist simultaneously within one person).

tl;dr It *is* us vs. them, but ""us"" and ""them"" are fluid, and the difference is not in viewpoint, but in mindset, in the willingness or unwillingness to accept reality for what it is.","1288571810"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Ok, you made some very valid points.  I wish you would have done that from the beginning, maybe we could have avoided the name calling.  

The lack of video is a good point.  I dont know what happened, none of us do.  But as far as I know this guy was a 9/11 truther.  Say what you will about that crowd, I am pretty sure they are not right wing.  Again, the nut job label is up to you.  One fact that we know for sure is that the alleged assault (which is one punch to the face, with no video evidence) resulted in an arrest.  There was also visual evidence (although it really didn't look like it was from a punch) of an assault on the complainants face.

As far as I know the incident with the women being ""brutally"" stomped did not result in an arrest.  (personally I think it should have) And also did not cause any visual damage to the women.  (that I could see).  

Maybe they were bad comparisons, one was caused at an actual candidates event and one was caused at an event hosted by an entertainer.  I would agree with that point, but I don't think you brought that up.  Then again, I may have forgotten....As you have pointed out, I am a stupid fuck.

So one is obviously a bigger issue, although both are quite small issues.  One was reddit politics fodder for three days, and a case in point argument for why the republicans or tea partiers, whatever, no real difference, are angry violent ignoramus.  They cant all be racist idiots, but then again I don't judge large groups of people based on the actions of individuals.

1) Nobody created God: God is eternal, and outside our understanding.  As scientists say that what happened before the ""Big Bang"" is nonsensical question.  Same thing.

2) Free Will.  It's difficult to get your head around, but once you do, it'll all seem fine.  Basically, humans have Free Will, and God can't intervene.  If he did, it'd ruin the whole thing.  Essentially, life is one big test, and those babies go directly to heaven, do not pass ""go"", and do not have to collect a materialistic $500.  Blessed are the murdered babies.

3) Don't try and understand this.  It's like trying to explain Romeo and Juliet to a monkey who has mastered sign language.  Scientists will tell you that though they can grasp the basic essentials of language, they simply won't get the advanced emotional concepts.  Same thing, only moreso.

4a) It's a myth

4b) Free Will.  God had to test his creation, and when it turned out to be lacking, HE DID NOT TURN HIS BACK.  Instead, He offered us another way out.  All you have to do is embrace that and...

"science","t5_mouw","If it were really serious, we would be looking at ways to control the climate, not simply reduce emissions and hope. The entire emissions-control movement suffers from a basic logical flaw:

If it is so important that temperatures not rise, in order to save polar bears and prevent famine etc etc, then we cannot rely on simply removing our own contribution in order to keep temperatures static. The temperature cause may not be only due to human contribution, or the removal of our contribution may no longer be sufficient. In either case, climate control is the only option if the precondition is true.

But of course, pointing out this flaw evokes horror, and cries of ""we can't fux with the climate, we're not good at that stuff, we'll break things even worse!"".

Pointless. Either it is serious enough that we fix it, or it is not. At this point, social inertia seems to be saying it is not. Quit worrying, we'll survive. The polar bears might not tho.

"science","t5_mouw","You're very, very right.

I think what most Christians don't realize is that most of what Jesus is alleged to have said is a parable. The bible is largely metaphorical. There are some plainly literal parts. There are some comforting parts (2 Corinthians 9:8 for example), and there are plenty of discomforting parts. There's good and bad in the bible; it's a mixed bag.

I view the bible as a man-made book. Historical linguistics indicate that most books of the bible had many authors, and their text were blended together as one. It's thought that the translation is generally pretty error-free, and you can split many of the books up into mini-books. Each mini book, written by a separate sub-author reads far more coherently than they do as a whole. It'd be like if Harry Potter had sixauthors - split the individual authors' texts up, and you've got a more coherent set of smaller books.

I do, however, believe that the Bible is so grossly misused that it causes a lot of harm. Somebody earlier said that Paul wrote in one of his letters roughly, ""If your eyes contradict the Word, the Word is wrong and your eyes are correct."" I don't know whether this is true or not - I can't recall where it is, nor do I ever remember reading this. Maybe if you know, you could let both me and ChaosMotor know! But whether it is, it would be an interesting point that I was never taught as a Christian.","1288571842"

If you still want to put a bit of the audio from the sound recording, then mix it in tastefully. I mean, you tapping the decks there was loud enough for me to hear over the music (which no one should ever hear!). Obviously you've put a lot of work into setting up the music and preparing the video (720p!), so take the vital extra step and record the audio properly.

tl;dr: use soundboard recording instead of 'live' microphone recording.

[deadmau5's recording from last night gives a good example.](http://www.ustream.tv/deadmau5) He DJ'd at some club with the audio from the soundboard and the video from the webcam. Look OK, but sounds **great** for a live recording since it's from the soundboard.","1288571865"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;The last functioning government was abusive and oppressive.  
  
Ha! The ironing is delicious.  
  
Oh, well you wouldn't have wanted to live under the previous *US backed* dictator before the ICU government then. [Siad Barre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siad_Barre#Human_rights_abuse) a particulary brutal dictator who presided over some of the worst human rights abuses in Africa; propped up by US military aid for over a decade, naturally.  
  
Following Barres deposition through popular uprising in 1991; the country went through 4 years of UN peacekeeping which preceeded a decade of abject lawlesness tempered only by tribal infighting between regional warlords. Warlords of whom, it's worth noting, were armed and funded *again* by the US throughout this period.  
  
Around ***mid '06*** the ICU defeated the warlords previously in control of most of the country and responsible for the casual daily atrocities. For the first time since the withdrawal of international peacekeeping forces in '95 Somalia was functioning under some semblance of law and order.  
  
&gt;The ICU, which has brought some form of law and order to areas under their control after years of anarchy, has begun a massive clean-up campaign in the capital. It is the first time rubbish collectors will have access to the whole city, which until last month was split up into fiefdoms controlled by rival warlords.  
  
Erich Laroche, UN Humanitarian Director for Somalia;  
  
&gt;the country was in better shape during the brief reign of Somalia’s Islamist movement last year. It was more peaceful, and much easier for us to work, the Islamists didn’t cause us any problems.  
  
The UN passed Resolution 1725 on ***December 6th 2006*** calling on all member states;  
  
&gt;to refrain from action that could provoke or perpetuate violence and violations of human rights, contribute to unnecessary tension and mistrust, endanger the ceasefire and political process, or further damage the humanitarian situation.  
  
Naturally, on ***December 8th 2006***, the United States sponsored and directly participated in an Ethiopian invasion to depose the ICU and we now have the current situation in Somalia. Lawless and with the renewed prospect of prolonged guerilla warfare. In the proceeding twelve months maritime pirate attacks off the Somali coast rose from 8 to 26, 9 to 26 off Nigeria and have rapidly increased to the present date.  
  
&gt;During it's brief reign the ICU was sending armed groups with pick-ups mounted with machine-guns and anti-aircraft guns to central Somali regions to crack down on pirates based there. Stormed a hijacked, UAE-registered ship and recaptured it after a gun battle in which pirates — but no crew members — were reportedly wounded. ~ International Herald Tribune  
  
Guess how the US backed transitional government has dealt with the Pirates? Well according to Andrew Mwangura, program coordinator of the Seafarers Assistance Program;  
  
&gt;""it seems as if some elements within the Somali transitional federal government and some businessmen in Puntland (a north-eastern Somalia region) are involved because you know piracy is a lucrative business""  
  
Personally I wouldn't choose to live under Islamic law but if I was trying to survive day to day I'd take that over complete lawlessness and anarchy.","1288571909"

""Show him to me,"" was the calm response. He entered the ward alone, dignified and absolutely self-confident. He approached the maniac with slow steps. ""Put it down,"" he ordered. ""Put it down!"" In a trice the man dropped his weapon. ""Follow me."" And quietly, without turning around, the officer walked out the door, the man silently following. As the officer passed me I fell in step with him and asked softly, ""How did you do it?"" ""The buttons,"" he said, pointing to the gilt buttons on his uniform, ""The buttons.""

"prowrestling","t5_2qhk0","Mostly what I meant was that they need to consolidate the women's division and feature it only on one brand. Last I saw they had tag belts that were cut in half like a BFF necklace girls give to each other in elementary school and each brand only had about 8 or so women wrestlers. Put them all together (the ones already on the main rosters, not the current NXT one) under one banner and I think the match quality will go up. 

Bringing in a small stable of women's wrestlers from Japan would be a pretty good move when I think about it. Have one come in and beat a couple of the divas in good matches. Pair her up with a manager that can do all the talking and really put their skills over in a way that's not stereotyping them for being Asian. Then have her turn heel when another Japanese women's wrestler comes in and helps her defeat the current women's champ in a non-title match. Have them feud a bit, put on good matches. Bring in another Japanese wrestler so they can take the women's tag titles as well. Once they're pretty much sitting atop the women's division they can really use that to push puroresu style matches but sort of keeping it in the background in terms of programming until fans start talking about their matches more and more. Then use that momentum to push puroresu onto the male talent.","1288571932"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","**TL;DR:** second to last paragraph has my tips. The rest is just rambling.

A new-to-the-area missionary and a guy I know and like from college were on splits together this week and decided to drop by. They probably just assumed I was inactive. We chatted for a good while, telling mission stories and whatnot. Missionary was being cool; even admitting that our town kind of sucks (a b.s. test I use: 'cause to an outsider this place has nothing to offer). 

Eventually I casually mentioned that my name's only on the roster for my mother's sake, but that really I should have it taken off because if I don't have it removed I should be ex-ed for my beliefs. Share that I'm a de facto atheist. 

Missionary asks about what made me doubt, and I evade the question. I explain that I don't want to be disrespectful and that I'm not yet very good at the balance of being honest about my beliefs without offending the people I'm talking to. He assures me that he's heard it all as a missionary, and I proceed, seemingly reluctantly. I never make it seem like I'm trying to convince him; only that I'm helping him see things from the perspective I had while facing various issues. I even tell him that trying to shake a believer's testimony is useless because studies show that after someone has their belief shaken (if it's linked to their identity), they just shut everything out and profess more earnestly that they believe. I'm able to spout off nuggets of humanist logic for the next hour and a half. The whole time I'm asking if I'm being offensive or rude. They just smile and say it's okay. 

Don't know if anything will take hold. Just doing my part to plant seeds

Do you think that the ""design"" would be better if every nerve had its own nucleus and a direct path to its target?  Why is a shorter path optimal (in this case, its definitely not conduction speed)? Why do nerves travel in bundles?

The problem with the premise that Dawkins puts forth (and the one that I think you're trying to support with your posts) is that it suggests that the recurrent laryngeal nerve takes such a seemingly paradoxical path to its ultimate end-organ, therefore it MUST be a flaw in design...However, what is left out is that the path that the nerve takes actually serves in its function, which you would remember from M1 anatomy.

Programming is a repeatable, predictable and simple process that can be taught and managed like any other engineering process. The only difference between making software and bridges is that we've been making bridges for millennia, and have far more accumulated knowledge on it.

It's definitely true that most IT-based university courses are woefully outdated, if not completely redundant and unfocused, but they're far better than they were 5 years ago, and all reasonable expectations predict them to be better again in another 5 years.

I'm not picking on you individually when I say this, but of the many self-taught developers I've met, interviewed or worked with, virtually all of them have unusual gaps in their knowledge. Of course the inverse is also true of strictly university-taught developers, but the gaps tend to be less frightening. The one that frequently crops up is computability of given design patterns, as in, why one method if more or less efficient than another, or if a method is even possible. Understanding what goes on behind the compiler is really what differentiates good programmers from incredible ones, and it's damn hard to learn that sort of stuff outside of a CS text book.

The explicit or implicit argument is ""since I don't see (much) overt discrimination the current status quo must be the natural equilibrium!"". And then natural is equated with biologically induced and everyone can walk away and wash their hands of this mess.

That's not to say that it can't be done right. It just rarely is (for an example see the Pinker vs Spelke debate I [linked](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html) above).

*Including in the areas of relationships and sex. Actually especially there we have seen dramatic developments over the last decades. It's not the biology that's changing here. And especially in this area, part of it is achieving a culture that understands and deals with these differences rather than reinforcing and stereotyping them.

Do you think woman should be allowed to speak in a church or go around without their hair covered? Or that it is acceptable for a man to wear long hair? If so, you are quite used to interpreting the Bible in a specific social context.

&gt;Not true in many cases. Look up Greek pederasty. It was a mentor and student relationship. To the Greeks it was considered as a right of passage - no dishonor in it at all.

If we lived like an agrarian society, the costs of food would be much higher. We subsidize the hell out of food, cheap plentiful food = happy masses. Consequently we have companies like ConAgra which then takes our massive surplus of corn, and then convert it to pretty much everything that we eat.

If your talking about plowing fields, and putting in fertilizer as human interaction, then yeah those are human interacts one needs to have successful crops. But the pollinating, and sexing of plants is not all to important, because corn can pollinate itself.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Okay well, scientists have revealed that any object with a temperature above absolute zero emits light of all wavelengths with varying degrees of efficiency.  A blackbody is an object that absorbs ALL incident light energy while reradiating it with a characteristic spectrum.  A spectrum is merely the entire range of frequencies for this radiation.  

At the end of the nineteenth century (a time where many people thought physics was complete), physicists could not derive from first principles the blackbody spectrum.  Lord Rayleigh attempted to use Maxwell's Equations by considering a cavity of temperature T filled with this blackbody radiation.  

In the end, he came up with an equation which agrees well with the tail of the spectrum but the equation approaches infinity as the wavelength reaches infinity.  According to classical physics, this infinite number of tiny wavelengths implied an unlimited amount of blackbody energy.  This result which is theoretically absurd is the ""ultraviolet catastrophe.""

THE Cinnabon Recipe

Here it is:

Rolls:
1¼ oz. pckg. Yeast
1 c. warm milk
½ c. granulated sugar
1/3 c. melted butter (do not subsititue margarine)
1 t. salt
2 eggs
4 c. all-purpose flour

Filling:
1 c. packed brown sugar (I just sprinkle as much as I can and like, never measuring)
2½ TBS. cinnamon
1/3 c. butter

Icing:
7 TBS. butter, softened
1½ c. confectioners sugar
¼ c. (2 oz.) cream cheese
½ t. real vanilla extract (or almond extract, which I prefer and use)
1/8 t. salt (I don't always use the salt, and in fact, like the taste better without it)

Rolls: Oven to 400° F.
(1) Disolve yeast in milk.
(2) Mix in sugar, butter, salt, eggs, flour. Mix well.
(3) Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead into a large ball. Cover; let rise 1 hour.
(4) Roll dough into a 21"" x 16"" wide rectangle. With the butter softened, I just use my fingers to spread it generously over the dough. Load 'er up with the filling (see below).
(5) Roll from long-side to short-side. Pinch the ends.
(6) Using very sharp knife (I prefer a serated one) cut into 1 inch wide rolls, making sixteen. If want fewer, bigger rolls, cut them wider.
(6) Grease (butter) your preferred baking pan (I like mine to be all squished up next to the other)- I generally use an 11""x 15"" pan. Then place rolls in pan and into oven. Let the rolls rise for 30 minutes.
(8) Bake until the rolls are slightly browned and not doughy. This will vary according to your oven. Just don't overbake.
(9) When done, take 'em out and cover them in the delicious icing.


Filling:
While dough is rising, prepare the filling and the icing. Clean-up a little and then go read a chapter or two in your book.
(1)Soften butter, so that it is spreadable.
(2) After dough has been rolled out to the gigantic rectangle, spread the softened butter all over.
(3) Sprinkle brown sugar over entire buttered rectangle. Use more if you like more.
(4) Now sprinkle the cinnamon over the now sugary, buttery, doughy, rectangle.


Icing:
Cream it all together with an electric mixer (or by hand if you just want to exhaust yourself for some reason). Spread on hot rolls.","1288572123"

When people kill, rape, and maim specifically *because their religious leaders tell them to* and they do it *because they are good followers of that faith* then Religion ceases to be a tool and is instead the cause of hurt, murder, and rape. 

In the real world, Religion is not guilt-free, it is not just words on a page. It is a system of POWER that is used to literally justify AND cause harm. AND CAUSE HARM.

Again, if you BELIEVE in it, then it is not a tool, it is the cause. The belief is the cause. God say Kill your only son, Abraham. And Abraham goes to kill his only son. Justification/Cause, it's an incest of fucked up proportions. 

EDIT to say, one more time, that Religion is not the cause of all bad people and all bad acts. But we can fight the things that cause people to harm others, to commit crimes against humanity. We cannot fight religion (the SHIELD for these acts) because of people like you who are constantly defending it. Just like the Vatican and the pedophiles, in a NORMAL society we could call those men to justice and put them on trial, but with Religion as the SHIELD nothing can really be done. nothing.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dys4f/so_according_to_jon_stewart_if_you_see_someone/c13xpjy) you said opposing free speech is wrong.  But apparently you don't think opposing religion is wrong.  It's a matter of logic.  You are applying part of the First Amendment in one way, but another part in another way.  My argument is that in fact opposing free speech and opposing religion on the citizen level is not a First Amendment issue in either case so long as we're not talking about banning them on the government level.

As to your examples, I can't answer for the person referencing Schenk v. United States.  Seems like a silly comparison.  BUT you had already brought up the First Amendment 3 times by that point.  I would interpret the other comment differently ... as I said before that the comment is about the abuse of rights, not whether the rights should exist in the first place.

&gt; What if, instead of protesting Islam by burning Korans, they decided to protest Islam by stealing Korans from people? Would you give the same mocking quote then?

Reductio ad absurdum.  Again, I think the discussion of the criminal aspects of this is distracting from the larger point.  We can agree that it was against the law.  No one disagrees with that.  Instead, we're talking about the symbolic statement within the action.  Again, making a petty slippery slope claim is useless.  

Here's what it boils down to:  I argue that the Koran burning is, while legal, a malicious act.  I don't argue that it should be prohibited and I think those voices are minimal at best.  I also argue that the removal of the Koran, while not legal, was not malicious.  I honestly don't care about the criminal aspects of it.  He might have even driven above the speed limit to arrive at the protest!  *Gasp!*  If, instead, he would have stepped on someone's head in order to forcibly remove the Koran or to make another point (get the reference?), we'd be talking about something else altogether.  However, I am not arguing that all criminal behavior is acceptable.  That's ridiculous.  I'm not even saying that any criminal behavior is acceptable on a theoretical level.  The whole discussion is about one act, one event, one person.  I don't know how to make it clearer than that.

Furthermore, I think that your arguments that emphasize this as a First Amendment issue are misplaced.  You brought up the First Amendment stuff before the two linked comments were made.  If you're suggesting that the majority of Americans believe burning a Koran should be banned, it should be easy for you to take your First Amendment debate elsewhere.  I think it's overstated and misplaced in this space.  It just isn't a First Amendment issue.  ","1288572143"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","He couldn't remember his last meal.  The leather interior of his '68 Camero SS was so etched into his mind, it was like the rest of the world ceased to exist.  

Why did he decide to move to LA?  Could anything be better than Nebraska?  He couldn't be sure.  But he had to find out.

3.45 in his pocket.  Enough for the double down and not much more.  But GOD.  Was it good.  

Embarassed, he wiped ketchup off his chin and looked across the diner.  A blond with long curls sat at the counter, sipping a club soda and reading the paper.  Her blue dress was short - more than half way up her slender legs.  

Holy shit.  She was beautiful.  The little blue dress couldn't contain her large breasts.  They pressed against the front and the frilly ridge of her bra just peaked through.  More ketchup dribbled from his mouth as she stared.

Oh fuck. She caught his eye.  He licked his lips frantically and she giggled, going back to her paper.

Money or no.  Burger or no.  He had to have this woman.  HAD TO. 

He walked to the couter and sat on the stool next to her.  ""Felix,"" he said.  He made no effort to conceal his eyes staring at her chest.  She laughed again.  ""Jenny,"" she said.

""Jenny,"" he said, ""When was the last time you had someone really, truely, fuck you?'

Her blue eyes flashed open and she knocked over her club soda.  ""I beg your pardon?""  she said, shocked.

""You heard me,"" Felix went on.  ""When was the last time you were good and truly fucked?""  She babbled nonsensically.  He grabbed her hand, ""Too long.""

Her took her to his Camero.  She didn't resist as he raised her dress over her head, revealing her delicate lingerie.  He didn't bother to pull the bra off, just slipped her elegant breasts out of the top.  

""God,"" he said ""you're gorgeous.""  All he heard in response was her heavy breathing.

In no time he had removed her panties, tossing them aside.  He pushed her legs up towards her head, revealing her perfectly trimmed pussy.  

He rubbed the place between her lips, feeling the wetness at the opening, and then slid two fingers in.  To his surprised, he felt resistance.

""I meant to tell you,"" she said, ""The last time I was fucked was never.  I'm a virgin.""  She looked at him shyly.

""Jenny,"" he said, ""This is going to be a night you will never forget.""

He relaxed her by rubbing and kissing her thighs.  Then Felix moved his mouth to her warm, virgin pussy.  His tongue found her warm clit, hard with desire.  He pushed and kissed and nibbled.  She arched her breasts to the roof of the car.  

Felix unzipped his pants.  ""This is it, Jenny, it's going to feel great.""  She nodded, nervously.  

Felix put the tip of his throbbing member at the entrance to her cunt.  He pushed.  And pushed.  Slowly but with strength.  She moaned.   And he pushed past her maiden head.

He fucked her slowly, stroaking into her moisture soaked vagina.  He came tremendously - exactly timed with her.

(Hey - it's basically a fairy tale.  So she comes, ok?)","1288572147"

Huh? You are aware that adultery is an extramarital affair, not public sex. Assuming that you actually mean a public extramarital affair: Why should ""society"" care that a man takes a women out to a restaurant if he's already married? That's between him and his wife. 

&gt; There is no proof or evidence that God does not exist.

Have you read anything on this subject before? You argue like someone who has not. You are making the claim therefore the burden of proof is yours. I don't claim that a god exists, I don't even claim that a god does not exist. I only claim that your evidence for a god is insufficient.

You probably don't believe that the Loch Ness Monster exists. However you also probably don't make the active claim that the Loch Ness Monster does not exist. You simply have a non-belief in the Loch Ness Monster because the presented evidence is insufficient.

What they need are the skills. People NEED to be able to communicate clearly. They NEED to be able to look at past events to make future decisions. They NEED, NEED, NEED to understand statistics and interest rates. 

If you don't understand math then you don't understand the statistical reports the government puts out. If you don't understand math you have no way to understand economics. If you don't understand math then your bank is going to rape you up the ass without lube when you take out a loan. Those are just straight examples of applying math.

"happy","t5_2qh5i","&gt;First, the guy asked you to name some... He didn't ask for thousands, he asked for some. Of which you provided zero.

And thus you completely missed my point.  I said that if I named some, that would never prove anything, because there ARE thousands of similarities and differences and different things you can look at.  I would have to have a good definition as to what can be counted as culture, which he has to agree with as well, then we have to look at all these thousands, or millions, or whatever it may be, units of culture to make an informed decision regarding if Canada culture is similar to US culture.  

It's like if I said John looks like Bill, and you said that you don't think so, and asked me to name all the similarities.  That's not going to accomplish anything.  But you can still make a decision regarding whether the cultures are similar just by asking yourself if their similarities are numerous enough that most people would group them together, automatically.  Like if you look at two non-twin sisters and say ""hey, they look alike"" despite their many differences.  But if all of humanity ""looked like"" those two girls in our eyes, in this universe, that version of humanity would learn to discern subtle differences between everyone..  If humans had greater variation in appearance...different colors, spots, proportions, limbs, etc, then we would base our judgements off of broader things. 

It all depends on the variation in all other cultures, besides Canada and US.

If we just say that all cultures are simply not similar to any other culture, that turns it simply meaningless.  I feel like that is what the OP is doing...he's taking the *relatively* different differences and using those as grounds for declaring that US culture and Canadian culture are nothing alike, despite the fact that these differences are puny compared to the differences between Canada and...Nigeria.  

Because of the common roots and similar demographics, culture between the US and Canada are similar.  So similar as to be *the same*.","1288572184"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A large population does not translate into a lower quality of life. Low quality of life is caused by a lack of education, lack of political stability, and/or a lack of economic and technological development.

If the population size really mattered, then 200 years ago people would have been living fantastically, as there were only 1 billion people on the planet. Instead, they were starving, working themselves to death, and dying young of disease and cancers from all the pollution and waste around them. (there was no weekly trash service back then...)

&gt; Yes, but that doesn't mean anything in the real world. It's not the type of graph that matters, but the implications of the graph. Yes, in the past a similar curve was established, but it is nothing compared to the magnitude of the world's population today.

You can't judge how close we are to being ""overpopulated"" just by hearing the numbers or looking at the graph. Your intuition can't correctly handle what large numbers like ""7 billion people"" mean in the context of the entire Earth.

If you do an unbiased analysis of the Earth's resources (energy, materials, and land), you will find that the Earth can support at least 100 billion people with a lifestyle equivalent to that of a modern city dweller.

I suspect that once we get to that point (100 billion people), rather than ""peak"", we'll just start seriously moving into space (moon, Mars, orbiting stations). One of the advantages of having 100 billion people is that there is a *lot* of money for a space program and many millions of people who will happily volunteer to get off the planet...","1288572193"

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","&gt;I sometimes simply don't understand particular aspects and nuances of the language, which to native speakers, are innate.

I'm not really sure how true this is, even as a native English speaker I sometimes have to look up a word that someone has used to see what it means, and frequently it doesn't even make sense.

Is ""saudade"" actually a word that is often used? I think that I understand the feeling, but it's not a feeling that I frequently have and would thus have little use for the word, and if it's a word that isn't used frequently then the meaning of it would likely differ quite a bit between even native Portuguese speakers. I could imagine introducing it in to English though if I was an author though, which is one easy way to introduce foreign words in to a language, like ""gestalt"" was introduced via psychology texts into English.

&gt;It's not only that, for example, the patting on the belly is said to teach turn-taking.

That doesn't strike me as very likely, it'd be interesting to read some research about it. With hearing the mothers voice though there are two compelling reasons to accept it, first we can stick a small microphone up into a woman's womb and record what her voice sounds like, and second when the baby is born we can hook up a milk bottle with a little counter that counts how quickly the baby is sucking and playing it recordings of different voices. The babies start sucking more quickly when a recording of their native language is played.","1288572195"

You did say there could not me more than 3, which is stupid since there were **2** study groups in the information **given** to you. You need to learn to read, it's like talking to an child, I have given you information stating there were 2 relevant groups, this might be hard to understand but you're only referencing one. Let me show you how badly, as an adult, you fail:

&gt;Twenty-eight from the University of Toronto Scarborough subject pool participated for course credit (mean age 5 20.93 years: 39%Christian, 21% Muslim, 14% Hindu, 11% Buddhist, and 15% other (including nonreligious).

as well as,

Twenty-two right-handed participants from the University of Toronto Scarborough subject pool participated for course credit. The participants in this sample came from a diverse set of ethnic and racial backgrounds (33% East Asian, 33% South Asian, 28% Caucasian, and 6% other).

Study 1 and Study 2 respectively:

Dipole source localization confirmed that the ERNs were generated in an area approximately consistent with the ACC (pre-auricular-nasion coordinates, in millimeters, were as follows: x 5 2.2, y 5 1.5, z 5 43.5; dipole strength 5 106.9 nAm; this source accounted for 97.8% of the variance of the signal.

Dipole source localization confirmed that the ERNs were generated in an area approximately consistent with the ACC (pre-auricular-nasion coordinates, in millimeters, were as follows: x 5 4.3, y 5 35.5, z 5 23.1; dipole strength 5 94.8 nAm; this source accounted for 95.8% of the variance of the signal.

&gt; Second thing, I don't know anything about your second study, that article requires subscription and I'm not going to waste money on religion.

Who said anything about a **second study**? I said there were two study *groups* for the same experiment. You just definitely showed you as an adult, are not literate, maybe that's why you can't be convincing, are you like 8? Okay, come on, you must be a child, because you can't read and your only answer to an academic article was....and I quote ""**stupidity**"", you therefore must be 7 or younger to behave in such a manner.

*Waste money on religion*? It's a science article on the effects of religion on people, you'd be wasting your money on **science**, not religion. How stupid can you possibly be? A **science** outlet has a subscription service for **scientific* studies and somehow by subscribing to **a scientific service**, you are spending money on religion? What...kind...of reasoning...are you seriously using?

&gt; Third thing, was Noah and his Ark a real thing or not? Only two possible answers, Yes and No. Choose one.

Scroll wheel, use it, and you would have seen my answer, but seeing as **you cannot read*, no wonder you have **not seen it**. 

&gt;Fourth, forget the article about corruption.

No, let's continue on your retarded mistake:

&gt;Please point out the relation between how believers in God are more happy than disbelievers in God, when correlated with how people perceive other nations to have corrupt political parties.

&gt;Let's slowly break down your argument while many people laugh at you.

&gt;(1) First link: Theists are happier than atheists. (2) Second link: A study/ poll done on which nations people perceive to have the most corrupt political governments.

&gt;So you are saying, theists who have corrupted political systems are not happy and this correlates to our discussion how?

&gt;I'm saying that no matter how religious you are, if your children dies because of starvation, you can not be happy.

Yet the article has nothing to do with dying children but on how business men **perceive** nations to be corrupted. Again, **what is the relation* between the **article you cited** and your stupid **argument based on it**?

&gt; Sorry, my mistake. Still, the question stays: were they all bad? Did they all (every single one of 20 million people) deserve to lose their home or family members?

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: There are seven types of martyrdom in addition to being killed in **Allah's cause: one who dies of plague is a martyr; one who is drowned is a martyr**; one who dies of pleurisy is a martyr; one who dies of an internal complaint is a martyr; one who is burnt to death is a martyr; who one is killed by a building falling on him is a martyr; and a woman who dies while pregnant is a martyr.

Dawud: Book 20 Hadith 3105

Want to see a pro-science atheist hate on science he doesn't understand?

&gt;How can 15% people of the group even exist, when a group is 28 people? That's 4.2 men. **Your data is not very correct (unless there's a 0.8 of a man walking somewhere).**

This is funny, an atheist who swears by science and the scientific method, arguing that science must be wrong. Genius, hello, yes you, how is it *my data*? I'm curious to know when I took part in this research, please inform me oh *all knowing one*! In fact when you pay and get what the article is stating, the percentages represent the belief background, not the people. Which is funny as it proves you **cannot read**. If I say I have 7 friends, 80% from hindu background and 20% from satanic background, then there in total is someone/ persons who have a mixed background in satanism and hinduism. Again, I **expected you to fail at reading and doing basic arithmetic and comprehension**, you're like the Glenn Beck of atheism, **keep the stupid coming**!

It is a fantasy meant to give the government the warrant to steal from people and give to large politically connected corporations. It's a fantasy designed to give the government an excuse to garrison the planet.

The precise reason the American people are ""in danger"" of being attacked by terrorists is precisely because the US government purposefully makes them less safe. It's a fraud; it's a fantasy designed by the political class to justify their power. Look at what [bin Laden said](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/interview.html) is his motivation for attacking the US. Look at the [connection between terror and foreign military entanglements](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/18/it_s_the_occupation_stupid?page=full). Terrorism has nothing to do with ""our freedom"" or religion but a fundamental struggle against the heavy handed tactics of the US government. 

And the American people have to pay the debt of the government's actions, in blood and treasure.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","As of the 99 NEC (National Electrical Code), it is required for all switches to be ""effectively"" grounded. 

*    If the box is metal (and the box is properly grounded) the switch yoke can serve as the grounding means (mounting screws).

*    If the box is plastic, there must be a correct ground conductor connected to the grounding screw.

So, Is there a ground conductor in the cable(s) entering the box? (There well better be :-)...  and is the box metal or plastic? 

*   If the box is plastic, all the grounds entering the box should be tied together, and there should be a short pigtail from that to the grounding screw of the switch.

*    If the box is metallic, all the grounds entering the box should be tied together, then a short pigtail should connect from that connection to a grounding screw on the box. In this case, the metal yoke of the switch when screwed to the metal box will provide the proper ground.

As to cost. If the proper wiring is in place, it is not a huge job to add pigtails. If the proper wiring is not in place, IE: if all the cables entering the box do not have a grounding conductor, while highly unlikely, would be a MUCH bigger problem. 

A more possible scenario is that whoever did the wiring clipped the bare ground conductor off where the cable enters the box. That, also, would be a much bigger problem.

Edit; So you don't think this is just mindless ""requiring"". This was done after many years of reports of people getting shocked from defective switches. Especially in the kitchen &amp; bath, where they would, for instance, reach to turn on the disposal, while touching the sink faucet. The ground is there to keep the metal parts of the switch (and a possible metallic cover plate) from becoming hot in the case of a malfunction (it will trip the breaker instead). As to serious, it is eliminating one more potential for electrocution... I know I have many times gotten a shock from the cover plate screws of a switch. My painter friend says it happens to him a lot also. He now always turns power off to a room before removing any cover plates (which is a good idea anyhow :-)","1288572216"

2) Babies automatically go to the Celestial Kingdom (the Mormon version of heaven) so these were god's elect. They had to receive bodies for some reason and your pain and suffering of losing them was just an unfortunate consequence of this necessity.

3) Because God loves you and doesn't want you to be led astray by a false god.

&gt;But there is a consilience or convergence of evidence from paleontology, geology, botany, zoology, physiology, anatomy, etc., all of which leads to a proof of evolution."" 

(*sic* - I might say ""a strong case for evolution"" myself.)

(Or in colloquial terms: 

If it looks like a duck, and it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, and it swims like a duck, then we should logically consider it to be a duck unless some other evidence comes along that shows that it's not.)

If we try to analyze all this stuff down to the very last tiniest most exact detail, we'll never know exactly what we think -

""The centipede was happy quite,   
Until a frog in fun   
Said, *""Pray, which leg comes after which?""*   
This raised her mind to such a pitch,   
She lay distracted in the ditch   
Considering how to run.""

\- Just try to read a good sample of the data, toss out all the logical and other fallacies, take your best shot, and be open to correcting your ideas as new information becomes available.

That's all that anyone can do. ","1288572286"

From wikipedia:

&gt; The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide for two main types of plea agreements. An 11(c)(1)(B) agreement does not bind the court; the prosecutor's recommendation is merely advisory, and the defendant cannot withdraw his plea if the court decides to impose a sentence other than what was stipulated in the agreement. An 11(c)(1)(C) agreement does bind the court once the court accepts the agreement. When such an agreement is proposed, the court can reject it if it disagrees with the proposed sentence, in which case the defendant has an opportunity to withdraw his plea.

So you obviously don't have a fucking clue what you are talking about, internet lawyer. Up until sentencing, what his punishment would be was up in the air.

All your other points about Islam and the ""real world"" are secondary and not germane to YOUR original statement, nor have I disagreed with them once (again, why do you insist on repeating points that are not in contention?).

This isn't a matter of interpretation, your original statement was factually inaccurate.  I don't understand why you can't a) prove to me that all the examples I gave you are false or b) admit that you were wrong.  I will lay it out for you:

* Your statement:  Only Islam and Orthodox Judaism forbid interfaith marriage
* My refutation: Druze, some Hindus, and Parsis also do this no matter what.  Many other faiths (including between some sects of christianity) also do this unless someone converts (e.g., Islam)

Do you maintain your original point or do you agree that you were in error?  Very simple question.  If you would like to have a discussion about all your secondary points (power of islam in the real world, honor killings, etc.) afterward I would be happy to.

My point is essentially that your claim is a. vacuous, and b. ignoring half of evolutionary theory (the part that filters the 'good' from the 'bad'). e.g. We see sickle cell as a *positive* mutation in areas of Africa where malaria is rampant, because it increases their reproductive value - this has been selected for. In developed countries, it's a mutation that impinges on fitness, therefore it's a negative mutation. Your example does, in fact, provide argument against this intelligent design that you're so hell-bent on pushing. The design doesn't have to be *good*, it has to be *good enough*. 

&gt; I don't believe 3.5 Billion years is enough time for evolution to have taken place on its own.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Then you're picking and choosing your morality. Which is fine but then why do you need the Bible in the first place if your wants will override it? You don't!

Everyone picks and chooses their own morals.  There is no objective universal ethical system.  

&gt;if you can believe that certain passages are false, then why believe in the resurrection of Christ or the numerous miracles mentioned? 

Why do the miracles have to be true or false?  What if the miracles in the biblical narrative are just narrative that have more meaning than true or false.  

&gt;If the Bible is the word of God, to pick and choose what you will and won't obey flies in the face of the intended purpose of the Bible.

What does it mean for the Bible to be the ""Word of God.""  The narrative given in the Gospel of John calls Jesus the Logos and in turn word of God.  Are you implying that since I'm a Christian I should believe God wrote the Bible?

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;all because of religious dogma

You mean, not because people were just unhappy and pissed off at each other and needed an excuse? 

&gt;but religion still does incite people to kill those who disagree with them

No, I think you're mistaking religion with hatred and bigotry.  There is certainly a difference.

&gt;It's also a characteristic of humanity.

Bingo.

&gt;Religion stifles scientific development.

So you're ignoring all of the math and engineering that went into creating the Great Pyramids of Giza?  The Duomo in Florence?  The Hagia Sophia?

Not to mention that the study of astronomy (discovered by the Egyptians) were all motivated by religious beliefs.  Also, I don't think Gregor Mendel would have figured out genetics by looking at pea plants if he hadn't been bored out of his skull from being a monk in Austria.

Sure, you mention what happened to Gallileo, but it certainly isn't fair to just ignore all the positive contributions religion had to scientific discovery.

&gt;Religious teaching oppress minorities

I know plenty of devout Jews and Catholics who are gay and nobody seems to have a problem with it.  Perhaps it's just that some people (for whatever reason) hate gay people?  And they need a good excuse?  I mean, with all of the evidence to the contrary, you don't think anyone thinks that gays are destroying the ""sanctity of marriage"" do you?  It doesn't make any sense, but it certainly sounds better to the public than ""Let's lynch us some fags!""

I think simply hating on religion is too damned easy (almost as easy as hating all gays or blacks), and I challenge you to widen your worldview just a fraction of an inch and learn to just deal.  Religion isn't going away any time soon, and as you said, most of the bad things about religion are just ""characteristic of humanity.""  If religion ever did go away, we'd find another reason to justify our hatred toward each other.","1288572337"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;I'll go back to my original statistic: 22% of the world's population is Muslim. Since 1901, 123 people and organizations have received the Nobel Prize. Out of every single 123 recipients, how many were of the Muslim faith?

Um what? The USA alone has had 326 citizens as recipients of a Nobel Prize since 1906. That's 329 out of [840 Nobel Prize awards. 817 of these awards went to unique individuals (i.e. one person not receiving multiple awards and also not an award going to an organization)](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/nobelprize_facts.html). This is hugely different than your claim of total prize winners.

178/817 are/were Jewish   
9/829 are/were Muslim

In any case your claims have been shown to be wrong with one small sample size.

You also go on to conflate Islam as having been in existence before Christ with this little tidbit:

&gt;Following me? Ok, I'll continue. For centuries the middle east and followers of Islam were the leaders in philosophy and science. They had the largest libraries, the most liberal scientific ideas, and the greatest scientific culture. It literally took until after the middle ages in Europe for another society to rival the advances that the Middle East had before jesus walked the land.

Which is a pretty egregious error to make when trying to state how poorly educated other people are.  In fact Greek thought was a driving force in Christianity in it's spread through the Mediterranean via the Roman Empire, sustained in the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire (Which lasted until AD 1453). They never experienced 'The Dark Ages' which was a phenomenon localized to a power vacuum and feudalism in the west.

This same Greek thought was pervasive further east and south and was assimilated by Muslims (which originated between AD 610-632) as they began conquering foreign lands. This can be linked with the later sacking of Constantinople in 1453 by the Ottomans. 

In any case your chronology about the appearance of Islam in relation to Christ is one of clear ignorance as are your metrics about the Nobel Prize. These seem to be the backbones or your assertions and they support no weight.","1288572375"

We're not talking about the standards the owners of the planes set. We're talking about the standards the federal government sets. If you don't see a problem with the federal government requiring you to appear naked before them before boarding a plane, I don't even know what to say. We're not talking about ""private"" planes here. Sure, they may be the property of some corporation, but those corporations are exclusively publicly-held corporations. In addition, they don't pick their customers. Virtually anybody can purchase a plane ticket online. The airports out of which airlines operate are often public airports. Finally, the presence of the FAA is evidence of the fact that the federal government recognizes the need for consistency and regulation in the aviation industry; in other words, the airline industry is so vital to the country that it needs to be fair, consistent, and safe. Think of it like telephones or highways. They started out as private entities, but when an industry becomes absolutely vital to the operations of the country, it gives up some of its autonomy.

In this sense, we do have a great degree of a *right* to aviation. Of course, if airlines really were completely private entities, this wouldn't be an issue. Market forces would simply not allow for such a fucking ridiculous notion as naked body scanners or pat-downs that are tantamount to government molestation. (Can you imagine this sort of bullshit happening on a private charter bus?)

So, bearing this in mind, in addition to the critical fact that the TSA is a government agency, how can you defend this bullshit?

They had hardly ever played any public gigs, so we crashed the party. So my sister, her husband, and I got toasted, crashed the party with the assistance of the guest of honor, and then lurked in the back of the mansion's expansive lawn. Our attendance at the concert lasted about one minute. Just as The Morlocks were cranking up the nastiest thing I'd ever heard performed live on stage, the parents found us. As they cranked up ""I Snub You"" by Iggy Pop, the parents challenged us and asked us who we were. We said that we were with the band. She told us to leave, and gave us 10 seconds. What a bitch. We stood our ground, and she called the cops. We left before they got there.

Why implement new blocks with no purpose yet? New enemies with no purpose (zombie pigmen)?

All of these things will no doubt be fantastic when they get fully realised, but I think adding them now was the ""gravy"" I spoke about in the original post. It would be like adding alchemy into the halloween patch, but not being actually able to use it, and have no alchemy recipes.

I feel like I'm not really getting anywhere with my original argument so I won't go round and round about it. Hell and biomes might be mindblowing in 2012 but at this stage, the actual time they were released as a patch to a very popular game, they have no real merit.

Let's agree to disagree. You see the game as a huge, long term project (which it is) and I see it as something I sit down and play with friends in the here and now (which it is). I would rather see what is there being improved and fixed, along with laying the bare foundations for future features. This update seemed to be not much but those foundations.

Guerilla warfare usually refers to a battlefield technique.

Only US citizens aligned with enemies of the state, such as Al Qaeda are targets.

You are throwing a bunch of different ideas into one basket. How long until the universe blows up?

Terrorists ARE freedom fighters if you believe in their cause and tactics.

Rebels in Boston committed acts of terror on Loyalists. It's nothing new.

&gt;Follow the law

Which law?

 &gt;There's ample precedent - and common sense - to support the claim that the executive branch can kill American citizens when they are sworn members of enemy forces and avowed traitors working with the enemy.

&gt; Which is why I have been arguing that the US needs to recover the traditional basis on which it has always gone after terrorists and non-state actors, and used force in the whole post-war period. That is the international law doctrine of self defense, with its domestic law cognate as recognized in the CIA statute of vital “national security” under a finding and orders of the President. The truth is, that’s what the Obama administration is doing when it targets Anwar al-Aulaqi, undertakes clandestine and covert ops in various places — its targeted killings, using special forces or CIA agents or UAVs — it is engaging in uses of force under the customary law of self-defense, and domestically under the processes and oversight set out in the CIA enabling statutes.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Belief is, by definition, the consideration of something unsupported by evidence. Because of this, it is inherently unfounded on truth. 

You can never ""win over"" a religious person by attacking their beliefs with logic. It will basically never work. What you have to do is get them to acknowledge a belief in something that will engage their rational mind, which you'll never do by attacking their beliefs. 

Push things like freedom to choose, peace, love, ""why don't we all just get along"". If they seem to want to debate, feel free, but never attack their beliefs, instead, attack the reasons why OTHER religions choose belief as the way to point out their stupidity. 

Never attack them, and always be very, very courteous. (It's hard to do, so I recommend against debating at all) If you do, apologize in advance, and be very, very respectful. 

People who are dealing with brainwashing and it's associated cognitive dissonance are very fragile when their beliefs are questioned. Pretty much, this applies to any strongly religious person.

Legally speaking, illegal aliens are illegal aliens.

I happily make a distinction between LEGAL IMMIGRANT and ILLEGAL ALIEN.  However, people that hate the working class often mix and mash up the two in order to increase illegal ""immigration"" and drive down wages.

Just so there's no confusion here: I make no distinction between LEGAL IMMIGRANT and native citizen.  Unfortunately, the other side insists on calling illegal aliens ""illegal immigrants"" (and, more and more often, simply ""immigrants"").  I also don't like the term ""illegal immigration,"" but there's no substitute that I'm aware of.

TL;DR -- don't blame me for bastardizing the language.  I try to call illegal aliens what they are.","1288572563"

Yes he does. He says, while characterizing the first perspective in his false trichotomy, ""they believe that **the purpose of the entire universe** is"" and then contrasts it with the second of his superficial alternatives, those people who think our existence does not have purpose.

&gt; What facts?

I listed some in the next couple of sentences, buddy. You have to read all the sentences together and in order for proper context.

&gt;&gt;There are absolutely no reasons to believe our existence is special

&gt;Try some psychedelic drugs or try having an out of body experience and then try telling me that.

That's a good point; fear and ego aren't the only explanations for a person believing in the supernatural. Others include cognitive and neurological disorders, coercive manipulation, stupidity and, as you say, chemicals which disrupt the biochemistry of our nervous systems.

&gt;&gt;The metric signature of spacetime, for instance, has no bearing on the question of your soul.

&gt;Again, how do you know this?

I assume it because the two have no obvious connection. If you would like to illustrate such a connection, you may do so. However, I am not going to believe everything which I can not immediately disprove. In the same manner as you have I could say, ""Sir, are you aware that sexual fantasies about peacocks are responsible for nuclear fusion?"" and when he replies, ""That is utter nonsense, sir, the two have neither causal nor logical relation!"", I would say, ""Aha! But you can not prove this, and therefore my beliefs are correct and interesting."" I would not however say these things because, as you can plainly see, it makes no sense.

&gt; Your views are very pessimistic. I'm not saying you're wrong but your confidence in our existence being meaningless is completely unfounded and unproven.

When we destroy any physical structure but a human body we can watch as the organization of its constituent molecules is lost all but in our memory. When the human body is destroyed however, surely that body's essence, which can not be seen nor felt nor measured in any way, escapes to a septate perfect reality where it dwells forever! Surely! How can there be any doubt? Until we can prove otherwise we should act as though this is the case!

But no. I am confident in my ignorance of these things because they have no evidence. My beliefs do not bear the steadfast certainty of a mathematical proof, I grant you that, but I am still confident in them because they are rational.","1288572607"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;How does science explain how everything came from nothing?

Short answer: nothing came from nothing.

Long answer: if you examine a vacuum - a volume of space with no matter at all inside it, you will find that there are [virtual particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle) which spontaneously create and subsequently annihilate themselves. The sum total of energy in the vacuum never changes, but yet it [sometimes] contains subatomic particles! After this was discovered, some scientists wondered if perhaps the entire universe was simply an extremely large example of the same phenomenon. So they went about estimating the sum total of all energy in the universe. [This article](http://vps.arachnoid.com/gravity/) gives a good explanation of how this estimation was done. Scientists found that the sum total of all energy in the universe appears to be zero. So the entire universe is nothing more than a random fluctuation of nothingness. 

Now, of course, you may then ask how the laws of physics which allowed such a fluctuation came into being: the answer is that no one knows, and it may just be unknowable.","1288572671"

I think our fundamental disagreement comes from our view of the bible. You feel that Jesus words hold more weight than other parts of the bible. I don't feel this way at all. I feel that all scripture is God-breathed. All of it has equal weight. 

I am a sinner. Homosexuals are sinners. Even if they weren't homosexual, they would still be sinners. Does this mean we should go around and tell them they are going to hell? NO! Not at all. But I cannot in good conscience, in light of my theological beliefs, tell them I agree with them. 

I still love them, and treat them to the same as any other human being. I know several gay people, and none of them have a problem with me. If asked directly if I feel homosexuality is a sin, a tell them yes, just as lying and cussing are. The fact that they sin changes nothing about them. Before I knew they were gay, I knew they were sinners, because we all are.

&gt;Quite often, pedophiles never develop a sexual orientation toward other adults. 

So they're not gay OR straight.  Are you stating that straight is the default sexuality, and everyone who isn't overtly gay must be straight?

&gt;Rarely does a pedophile experience sexual desire for adults of either gender. They usually don't identify as homosexual-the majority identify as heterosexual, even those who abuse children of the same gender They are sexually aroused by youth, not by gender. In contrast, child molesters often exert power and control over children in an effort to dominate them. They do experience sexual desire for adults, but molest children episodically, for reasons apart from sexual desire, much as rapists enjoy power, violence and controlling their humiliated victims. Indeed, research supports that a child molester isn't any more likely to be homosexual than heterosexual.

I'm still not convinced that a pedophile is more likely to be straight than gay.  I think that they are more likely to be **neither**.  That is, they prefer dominating children in the way that a rapist wants to dominate either men or women (or both).","1288572711"

"photoit","t5_2riab","I shot film from 1994 until 2003 and my pictures were OK, at best.  I was limited by a few things:

1.  Cost - film and processing cost money.  A roll of 36 probably costs 6-10 USD for development, printing and scanning depending upon where you go.

2.  Time - once you snap that shot you won't know if it works until you get it back from the lab.  The long time constant of your feedback loop would probably impede your progress (imo); not to mention that there no record of the camera settings for any of your shots - i.e. film doesn't have an EXIF analog.

3.  Lack of practice - the aforementioned cost limitations imply a limit to the number of shots you can take in a given day.  Repetition is really important to learning anything.

The power of digital media for learning is mostly limitless.  You have far more flexibility to get the shot right.  You say ""*film would force me to get things right the first time*"" - how exactly?  I don't see how waiting a day to see your results leads to improving your intuition especially if you didn't record your exposure for a given shot. 

Why not try to visualize the final image before you even lift the camera. Think about how to compose the subject/scene.  Then think about what exposure would be necessary to achieve your vision.  After considering all those things you lift the camera and set it accordingly.  Then snap!  Success/failure is determined by whether or not your image is consistent with what was in your mind's eye.  If it doesn't then reconsider your exposure choice and try again.  That's a very effective way to build your intuition.  

It would also help to learn a bit about how the variables of shutter speed, aperture, and ISO affect one another and then take practice shots...  set up a subject, fix the ISO and shutter speed and vary the aperture and take a few shots - six? - and see for yourself what the effects are.  Then repeat for shutter &amp; ISO.","1288572732"

It's interesting to see that all of the sources so far acknowledge the view that humans are 85% similar, and that most of the 15% variation is from within populations. The main point of your sources seems to be that race contributes more than people say it does, but I'm still making my way through your references, but I have a few questions. 

----

Actually, I first want to respond to your statement that we're in America's 15th decade of racial strife. Are you saying there was no racial strife before the civil war? We had blacks in fucking slavery. I'd say that humans have been living with racial strife as long as we've had the concept of races (the beginning?). The key difference is that it's usually been between countries, and that now we have less people dying because of it.

----

How do you feel about Brown vs Board of Ed, then? Was the Supreme Court wrong in their conclusion that separate things are inherently unequal, or do you think it's the right conclusion, and races should be kept separate anyways?

What about studies like [this one](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385.long), that find that diverse groups outperform homogeneous groups? Flawed study? There's something different about small groups vs society to explain the difference? If diverse groups really do come up with better solutions, how can that be harnessed while keeping cultures isolated from each other (or do you think it's better to keep cultures pure than to solve their problems better)?

Also, how can races be primarily biologically-based if different cultures identify different races? In the USA, nobody will self-identify as a Moor. In some European countries on the other hand...

-----

OK, I've read the first 5, and so far no race/genetics or culture/genetics correlation. BiDil was interesting (though you could have found a source published after its FDA approval), until I found this in Wikipedia ""the study data used to approve the medication only included self described African American participants and no other racial groups. BiDil could potentially be beneficial to all patients suffering from heart failure"". What that tells me is they haven't done any research to determine if it gives greater benefits to non-African Americans. I mean, if you gave penicillin to only self-described African Americans, you would find it's an effective antibiotic for them, but it wouldn't let you conclude that it works only on African Americans.

Maybe some researchers are onto things when looking at expression of genes instead, but it looks to me like they only found differences between Americans, Europeans, and Asians, not whites/blacks/asians.

----

OK, 6th source says that they found genetic markers that correlate with the ""popular conception of continental-based races - principally Africans, East Asians, American Indians and Caucasians (a group that includes Europeans, Middle Easterners, and people of the Indian subcontinent)"" and the response the article quotes is ""why not just skip directly to genetic differences when trying to cure diseases?"" and then the counter is ""we can't sequence everybody, so race is a good enough proxy"". Still has nothing to do with cultures or diversity, though.

----

OK, I'm going to have to stop reading here, since there's an election on Tuesday, and I need to read up on the candidates and ballot initiatives.

-----

EDIT: ok, read the amerika one and &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;...if you do an experiment and follow the scientific method, it is science. Being right or wrong has nothing to do with how scientific it is. Was Newton unscientific because his formulation of mechanics doesn't match up with reality? In the same way, I'd say that the few climate change skeptics that actually do researchers into alternate mechanisms of global warming are doing science (and I'm not the only one to acknowledge this). They're just not finding models that do any better than other ones that do blame humans for how bad things are getting.

If something creepy is going down she's usually oblivious to it. Her history of friends is an interesting one...  As far as the creepy-ness scale it's hard to say. He comes across as very gentle and relaxed, but you can see the unease in his face and mannerism when I, or other males, show up. He walks her home since he lives a block away and in the events when I pull up to her house as there standing outside, he tends to try and excuse himself and disappear before I can get up to them and shake his hand and say hello. No interest in conversation/greetings/politeness with me. You know how when you meet someone and you just pick up that really off-setting vibe. I tend to be pretty good with that but nobody's perfect. I believe he has 0% intent to harm her physically or anything, but I believe that he does it to not only help people but to get to massage and make contact with woman, especially younger ones. I lose a little sleep wondering if he is going to try and push the appropriate massage areas with her. I just assume if he does she'd let me know and stop attending. I just feel that it is rather inappropriate she be seeing this guy in particular and having 0 understanding of my views. Also, it's not like I fail to massage her and help her out.

I live in southern NH and would be willing to plan my next trip to Boston to include visiting this bakery. As for in-store acoustic shows I'm all for them; though, only later in the day, possibly after 7 PM. For coffee, I'm willing to dish out an extra couple of dollars for fair-trade and organic (so go for it!) ESPECIALLY if you offer coconut milk creamer, as it is the BEST coffee creamer (including non-vegan creamer). 

And on a side note, I love the choice of using a ceramic mug when I plan to stay at a coffee shop. I also love places that have really random mugs (as if they were bought at Salvation Army or Good Will) because it makes drinking the coffee more interesting! Additionally, big comfortable couches and free wifi are a MUST. Good luck!","1288572821"

Yea Mormon beliefs are pretty far fetched, but so are the beliefs of Muslims and Christians alike, so I wouldn't single them out. As far as ""lying"" to my children goes, I suppose you could only think of it as lying if you have the audacity to believe something is %100 true only because you believe it. It is true that I don't have all of the same faiths and beliefs as my wife, but I would hardly say I KNOW which one is true and which one is a lie. I only know which one is true for me.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think that Inception overthought itself a lot, to the point that it stopped making sense. Having thought about it for awhile (in conjunction with my Ariadne theory mentioned elsewhere in this thread), here's my best theory: the whole movie was actually inside a dream or hallucination that Leo's character is having and we never actually see the real world. The point of the movie was not the inception of the idea in that guy's kid's head, but rather Leo's character coming to terms with his perceived responsibility for his wife's suicide. In the end, he choses to remain in the dream with his children rather than actually waking up. 

Supporting evidence: Ariadne acting as the Id and the elevator into his subconcience. If I remember correctly, they did not actually get off at the top floor after the psycho wife episode, further suggesting that Leo's character is not actually conscious. If this is the case, most of your errors are passible, since the ""real world"" is not actually real.","1288572833"

Because Muslims care about the social integrity of marriage. Duh! If you want to publicly commit adultery (i.e. have sexual relations in public with another women who is not your wife, not merely take her out to a restaurant) you should find another society where it is permitted. There is no Law in Islam that says that one cannot leave a Muslim society if its not too ones liking. Islam allows freedom of association.

If the pope did rape children personally, he is still guilty for aiding and abetting all the other clergy pedophilia that was going on under his watch.  If the pope did not rape children personally, he is still guilty for aiding and abetting all the other clergy pedophilia that was going on under his watch.  

And before you ask, yes there is abundant evidence of his actions while in that office.  It's why a lot of people think he should be arrested and brought to justice.

In light of that, what do you think is more important here Moon?  Many catholic priests raping countless children in many countries, or the question of wether the current pope did so as well?  

My opinion (which is not proof) is that I find it unlikely that the man could have so diligently covered up cases of pedophilia and shuffled priests around to protect them (and provide them a fresh supply of kids) if the man didn't support the practice and approve.

In grade 8, a guy i was friends with walked up to me in recess and asked me out. being the smooth, suave bastard that I am, i turned away and ran to the other side of the school. yes, i was 13 years old, not 8 or something more understandable. One month later it dawned on me that he was actually pretty cool and i should have said yes. *facepalm*

2. My first serious crush came in my sophomore year. i was absolutely batshit crazy about this guy and i can relate to many of the crazy/stalker stories i've read in this thread. anyway after a few months of hanging out/making out and feeling like all my dreams were coming true, i gathered up the courage to officially ask him out, to which this happened
Me: will you be my boyfriend? i heart you
Him: he he he no but i'll be your fuck buddy, are you up for it?
Me: PFFT. PPFTTTT No, i'm worth more than that, NO. how dare you. you're so rude!
Within 2 months we became fuck buddies because i'm pathetic and couldn't get over him, then he got a girlfriend. FMMLLLLLLLLLLLL

3. One night i was getting outrageously drunk at a club with my friends after deciding that all men are assholes and the chances of me meeting someone decent was slim to none. I ended up hooking up with this guy on the d-floor. I cant remember much but i have vague flashes of draping myself over him telling him how hot he was over and over again. Like 'no seriously, you really are SO. FUCKING. HOT' etc etc, then laughing like a maniac and telling him how shit i thought the music was (apparently my way of impressing a man). We ended up getting to know each other a few days later and he was actually a really nice, smart person who i would have been interested in but with an introduction like that how would he ever have taken me seriously?

4. Me being a clumsy dick on a date story:

I was once on a date with this guy i was really into but i didn't know him very well. I asked him to the movies because that's how original I am and fortunately he said yes! (look what happens when you are forward!) Anyway during the movie i got out my lip gloss to make sure my lips were in great shape (for obvious reasons) and somehow a huge glob of it dripped onto my chest without me realising. I know this because when i got home after the date the first thing my flatmate said to me was 'dude what the fuck is that slime on your chest' and i realised i had orangey/red coloured liquid smeared into my chest right underneath my neck in full view. So the guy I was on a date with must have left thinking i was very, very unclean.

Another me being a clumsy dick on a date story. I was on another date with another guy and after we saw a movie together the conversation went like this (note: i was really really nervous because i really really liked the guy)

Me: Well that movie was pretty shit. Ok how are you getting home? Train? Bus? I'm getting the bus. If you're getting the train i guess ill say goodbye now. Cya. *edges away*
Him: Well... ummmmmmmm well.. I was thinking, I'm kind of hungry....
Me: Really? Oh ok. I'm not. I had a huge dinner and then I ate SOO much dessert I feel kind of fat actually. I'm getting the bus *edges away more*
Him: Oh ok... welll.... you don't want to grab something to eat then......?  With me?
Me: What? Grab something to eat.. Ohhh. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. OHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WELL! Welllllll come to think of it I could eat something. Yes I could. I will eat something. Where will we go?

I ended up choosing a burger joint OF ALL PLACES. And what happens? As soon as i pick my burger up to start eating it the entire thing disintegrates and ketchup, mayonnaise, meat and lettuce spreads out all over my hands. I spent the entire time trying to piece together my meal and eat it without him noticing it crumbling all over me even though it was really obvious, whilst trying to hold a normal conversation.
Oh god why am i so fucking awkward? I hope this has made some girls out there feel better anyway!","1288572863"

"science","t5_mouw","I think if you're happy being a Christian, you shouldn't change that. There are merits to believing, and de-converting is a slow and painful process, because I'm effectively un-learning the very foundation of me. I feel more in control of my life now I'm not a Christian, and I feel less burdened especially as I'm gay. :-p I've prayed a lot, and honestly, that time would have been better spent fixing the problem than wishing for it to be fixed - I was in control all along. However, it has got me through some tough times, especially senseless deaths in the family, and messed-up situations. Now I just look at it as the world just being the world, and I go forward confidently in the direction of my dreams - which thankfully, appear to be relatively benevolent. :-p

There are literally hundreds of lists online of inter-bible contradictions. Here's one: http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_meritt/bible-contradictions.html

Hurting others, sometimes, is a good thing. It's a horrible thing to do, but there have been times when I've had to be quite malicious in order to motivate someone else to get medical care they desperately needed. Superficially, I was playing the role of a jackass, and it hurt me to do it, but without it, they would have died. That is a case of hurting someone for their own good. A surgeon does the same thing - nobody likes the pain of recovering from surgery, but the hurt the surgeon inflicts is actually good. It's not quite so black and white.

Now, obviously, randomly punching someone out in the street is never good. That's where I'd draw the line, but I'm also a pacifist! :-p

There are cases where stealing can be a good thing too. Suppose you knew somebody had suicidal intent and had just bought a gun? What about if you suspected they were going to harm others? Stealing the gun doesn't seem so bad now. What if a loved one had a drug problem? Stealing their drugs isn't such a bad idea. Stealing someone's bike ... no that's just wrong.

Likewise, sometimes it's cruel to be kind. Being an enabler to someone's alcoholism, in giving them alcohol at their crying and begging is in a sense kind - you're relieving temporary pain; however, it's actually bad because you're causing great harm to them and those around them.

These are largely hypothetical examples. But maybe it's just my outlook on life, but the best good has come out of the cruelest times.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","You're harping on the wrong thing.  I don't care who puts the paycheck in your hand, if you want to be employed you must find a willing employer first.  If you want to work certain jobs you must join a union first.  Neither a union or an employer are supposed to be telling you how to vote, simple as that.

McDonald's employers are scaring their employees by telling them if these certain candidates get their way, they will hurt their business and the ability to give raises and benefits.  Union members are scaring their members by telling them if these certain candidates get their way, they will hurt their power and the ability to negotiate for raises and benefits.

The only difference is that these people can go work at Burger King, you can't just decide to leave your Union and be allowed to work the same job still.","1288572889"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I hate Ticketmaster's outrageous fees as much as the next redditor, but thought I might butt in with a story about how their policies actually helped me.

I bought tickets for a show in Denver while I lived in Atlanta, because the tour wasn't going to reach the southeast and my husband and I were planning on spending a week in Colorado around the same time anyway. I opted for paper tickets. For weeks beforehand, I wrote notes to myself everywhere: WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT FORGET THE CONCERT TICKETS. I put them in an envelope and placed them inside a book I was planning to bring. The morning of the flight, I forgot that the tickets were in there, and I brought a different book. 

I noticed the night before the concert that I had managed to leave the tickets in Atlanta. The day of the concert, I frantically searched Ticketmaster's policies for a solution. They don't explicitly have a policy for lost or destroyed tickets, but they do have a hotline you can call if your paper tickets never arrived in the mail. I lied and told them that the tickets never arrived, but they didn't ask any questions. They needed my credit card number (the one I used to buy tickets) and the confirmation number, and within minutes told me that I could pick up new tickets at will-call.

So, after almost 24 hours of stress (I thought I had ruined our vacation, and that we would have to pay hundreds of dollars to go to the concert with terrible seats if we could still go), I picked up the tickets without a hitch.

It was this idea that you're pleasing people by giving them power over you in ways they never should have. At all.

You're not only being a pussy, you're acting like a child. I mean that, 100%. In what twisted dimension was it ever reported to you that a wife has ANY bearing over masturbation in any way, shape or form?

It's not even rational. It's your body, your personal habits and it's none of her business at all, even as her husband. Why? Because it has absolutely no bearing on her whatsoever.

I'm done making fun of you (you deserve it for being a man and acting like a child) but I guarantee you your wife will go looking for other men when she *does* get her sex drive back because women don't like cuckolds except to humiliate them.

I'm not suggesting that you be a brute and an asshole or 'keep your wife in control,' I'm suggesting that you be a man and have some self-respect and quit groveling for permission to do something that is undoubtedly your god-given right to do.

Fox news does the same bullshit about their issue of the day, but bashing them on here is a waste of time if you ask me.  Its not exactly ground breaking!  Given that fact, I all to often have to argue for what appears to be for the tea partys side, cause I expect more from the people here.

There are neurological differences between natively bilingual people and the unlucky folks who only grow up with one native tongue - it's these two different aspects of bilingual acquisition that I'm concerned with.  

The polylingual kids lag behind in school until about 7-8 years old, as it's hard to manage multiple codes, and uses more of their cognitive resourses, but then they start leaving the monolingual kids in their wake...they even stave off the onset of dementia for an average of five or so years longer!  None of this applies if the person isn't exposed to a second language from a *very* early age - a five year old kid picking up a second language is learning it, rather than acquiring it, and will have no neurological or cognitive difference from a monolingual person.","1288572978"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","The first guy was right.  Slackware.  Seriously.  I upgrade with every new release, but I could stick with this version for years, only upgrading my kernel and other bits as necessary.

You have your the core utilities (supplemented by slackpkg, sbopkg and src2pkg), a desktop environment/window manager of choice and software on top of that.  Some say the core utilities are long in the tooth, but that's what makes the platform possible.

Of course you have to open it up to give people a choice of desktop environments (Slackware has KDE, XFCE, Fluxbox, blackbox, windowmaker, fvm2 and twm, and I compiled e17 in addition to openbox), but once you pick one you're basically there: core, graphical layer and software.  And KDE seems to be the DE of choice, as well as being the most automagical of the choices, so you could stick with that.

I think it's basically because Slackware develops for stability and simplicity, ships the most vanilla packages I've ever seen, and has a DIY community that builds tools like src2pkg, slackbuilds and its sbopkg so that instead of needing a backport or an official package from the distro, you can just build what you need.

You also don't have all the problems introduced by featureitis, such as switching from straight gnome to an in-house unity desktop.  And because things are vanilla and the distro is built for a DIY kind of person (though you don't have to be to use it), all the tools are there and you run into fewer problems.

It has the reputation of being hard to configure, but that's outdated.  Between the new kernel abilities and the KDE4 or XFCE4 desktop, you don't need to configure anything to be running a complete desktop that is the equal of anything out there.  And I think it meets the platform model, because it's easy to upgrade anything from the kernel to your widgets while leaving the core utilities intact.","1288572992"

Just look at what happens when unproved beliefs are taught as science.  One example that has been used successfully in legal challenges to creationism is Stalin's favorite ""geneticist,"" who, in keeping with Stalin's belief that all differences between living things are caused by their environment, and not genetics, wrote that genetics are irrelevant to crop successes.  The Soviet Union adopted his ideas, and as a result suffered catastrophic crop failures for decades, and forced the USSR to rely on American-grown wheat to avoid famine.","1288573021"

The fact that she could always use the help and I can't always be there to rub her keeps me from really bother her about it. We've discussed it a few times and it usually ends in a short argument. I just try to not come over directly after her massages as to not be off putting. Things would be a lot easier if she just understood my issue with it.

I do feel I'm changing overall for the better, but I also feel I have lost some of that person who never got depressed. I think we and other people have to recognize that depression isn't a cold, it's not something you can just ""get over"" and never get again. It involves a certain thought process and lifestyle which need to be adjusted. It's gonna take some serious TIME.

Stop trying to analyze why you're depressed and just focus on what fixes it.  Exercise, food, fun, sleep, getting help. When you feel better, work and other things will be easier, then the happiness can build up. :)

However, it does bring to question that if all one can work with is just the defaults, will the content be more creative?

I find this is true with paints, if you only use the base necessities.  Using only a maximum of the primary colors, it forces the painter to come up with their own colors.

Meh, it's a grey area.  If nothing else, using as little as possible is an exercise in precision, so when you use more tools, you use them to their maximum potential.

The accelerometer is an old spark fun product, 3 axis i2c thingy. I was going to use them for a motion tracking design project in college but the coding guy could never get it to work. Enter the arduino nano, I bought that and was getting data from the sensor in hours, I made a little bread board circuit that lights LEDs based on how you tilt it. I saved the files and stowed them away for a rainy day. When this project came up it was a simple task to just alter the code a bit. 

Code is [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6716903/VoterCode.txt) Just keep in mind that I was in a huge rush to get this done. 

The LEDs were going to be pulsed.. you know save power and all that.. I used that LED array wizard website, oranges are chained in 9's and blues in 4's with all those resistors on the perimeter.. I only had SMD resistors so I had to go through the pain of individually wiring allllll of them. Its a terrible circuit. The grounds were split and mosfets (from a motor controller project) are used to switch power to the LEDs. 

Quick, dirty, simple, hacked together from bits. 

EDIT: Whoa, wait a sec.. that is some old code. I wonder if I forgot to save... at any rate that is the shell that I tossed code into. ","1288573093"

Your work history is emphasizing dates more than where you worked.  It should be the other way around.

Your bullets don't tell anything about what you actually did.  You need details and numbers.  Tell stories.  Give the resume reader something interesting to read.

Your ""Skills and interests"" is really a laundry list of buzzwords.  If you want to have a section called Buzzwords at the bottom, go ahead, but since nothing is emphasized, nothing is interesting.

Are you applying for a job handling snakes?  I'm assuming that your snake experience has nothing to do with the work you're wanting to do going forward.  Drop it.

Every job is difficult in it's own way; that's what makes them jobs.  Being an effective teacher requires charisma, diligence, and the willingness to learn with experience, no doubt. Being an effective carpenter requires years of experience, considerable knowledge, and problem-solving ability.  Being an accountant requires lots of specialized knowledge of tax codes, extreme attention to detail, etc.  I've taught at the university level for 8 years; I do not find it similarly difficult.  Teaching at the K-12 level seems like it has more challenges related to behavior and dramatically less specialized knowledge required.  I'll grant that I would not feel comfortable in front of a room of 7-year olds, but it's interesting that professors begin to teach with no training in how to teach whatsoever, and that, at least in my experience, most of the best teachers I've had taught in universities, not K-12.

"science","t5_mouw","Some big ones that come to mind;

One of the key requirements of most forms of success is higher education, but very few achieve what's needed to enter that higher education in an inner city school where the other children hold the material back from ever getting near college-prep levels.

Another key requirement of success, particularly if employment isn't available, (because of a lack of education, prejudiced employers, an economy with too much labor available already, or whatever else) is capital to start a business of some sort.  If you start in poverty you don't start out with any capital, and if you don't have a way to earn money without a business, but you need a business to earn money, you're in an impossible situation.  

Loans help, but they still require some capital, (and credit) to leverage, and even for qualified borrowers (which the impoverished are unlikely to be) business loans are not always available because they just aren't all that profitable for banks to do often times.  I have a fancy graduate education, and I couldn't get a business loan.  I wound up starting businesses on what I could save, ten thousand here, ten thousand there, and I would never have managed that if I didn't have the education to create mathematical business models, be familiar enough with the law to know how to navigate regulations, taxation and so on, in addition to the knowledge required for the actual business.  Asking someone with no background or education to pull of something like that is a bit like asking a man with one leg to climb mount everest.  Maybe it can be done, but it's not a reasonable expectation for everybody.  You certainly couldn't call one legged men lazy layabouts just because they couldn't manage it.

You can probably come up with more examples along these lines, if you think about how you would make money, and then think about what you use to do it, and look at how many of those things someone in poverty doesn't have access to.","1288573120"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh gawd, I totally feel you there, and it gets worse as you get older.

I'm 38, *never married*, sociable IT geek, tall, and ""a bit"" on the attractive side.

It's unwanted. Simply put I do not fraternize at work (seen enough bad situations happen to other folks, wont go there), and over the years pretty much every place I've worked became a minefield of some sort.

-Unmarried women in their 30's are scary

-Managers, or managers with marital problems are even scarier

-Older mothers trying to introduce their daughters are a pain

-Cute interns who don't know any better are ...

-Lawyers, man, I don't even want to go there (I do have one awesome related story though)

-Upper management/bosses above all take the cake :/

-Gay men, which is off topic, is awkward but actually flattering (can be more upfront with them, happened a couple times).

Unless it's in a group setting or work related I learned not to do friendly 1 on 1 lunches (which sucks!). At work I've had my ass grabbed, foot under table rubbing my leg, boob brushed (from behind with them bending over my shoulder to get something on my desk or to click on something with my mouse for example), the *inadvertent* hand bumping into my penis, me sitting down and oh so casually from behind their crotch rubs into my shoulder..

I used to find it amusing at times when I had to access someones workstation by crawling under their desk and they remain sitting down a bit close for comfort (wearing a short skirt, don't they know better?). A few times I've had fake work tickets for a workstation connection issue and I must to go under a desk to access the problem. So again they back off still sitting in their chair, I crawl under, find that the Ethernet cable is loose/unplugged (which just doesn't happen), I look back to crawl out or say I found the problem and I catch a good glimpse of crotch. 

But above all it has reached the point of receiving sexually overt e-mail/txt messages (""I want to ride your cock all day long"" and do this and that..).

To my dismay I've gotten into fights with (ex)girlfriends over it, they complain that I should press charges but I don't want to (I accept people following their natural tendencies, nobody's perfect). Yeah I tried to hide the txt message/e-mail but shit happens and they happen to find out.

And yes I've tried sliding in some conversation that I have a girlfriend, or maybe it's my failure not spelling it out trying to get them in the friend zone (awkward).

The solution, I found that working for myself doing remote support from home is best :P

(heh, reading what I just typed I think I sound like a troll, but it's the truth. Man am I ranting, bleargh!!)

""Kapu no ka ilio"" Means like, ""kapu"" is the same as ""taboo"" -- same word and meaning and etymology. And ""ilio"" is dog. It actually means something like ""consecrated to the dog"". 

They put it on the doggy bags at a restaurant in Hawaii I used to work at.

 Another restaurant I worked at was a high class French restaurant, and whenever someone asked for one, the waiter would just laugh and come into the kitchen and tell the cooks and dishwashers, and everybody would laugh at them. Then we'd fix up something really nice and sneak it into the package along with their leftovers, as a joke. Some minds must have been blown to see an entire meal in addition to their leftovers.

While incorrect, the statement regarding the planes isn't completely far-fetched to the point that it invalidates Jeremy's agenda. Also, his point is not to deal with the different causes of death, but to make us realize that a disproportionate amount of fear and thought are given to 9/11. This directly ties into the main point he tries to make: 9/11 was and is being used as an excuse to slowly strip us of our personal rights.

Small lies and smaller fallacies pointed out here does not take anything away from the point of this whole message. It certainly doesn't make ""his agenda shit"", seeing how loss of privacy and the consequences which come with it are FAR more dangerous than anything else that has happened since 9/11.

Exception: The advantage given is not something meant to be differentiating, but rather something done as a procedural matter.

For example, we make hundreds of students write together for logistical purposes.  Allowing someone with anxiety to write alone is OK.

Similarly, if there is a rule limiting the types of calculators that can be used, it should be fine for a visually-impaired student to use a calculator with the same feature set, but large buttons.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Just to clarify, I don't consider myself sitting on the sidelines or ignoring what is going on. I use both open and closed products, have contributed to open source projects (with code and money), as well as producing, using and buying closed products. So you can say I am part of the problem if you like.

There is choice in the market for developers and users for open and closed systems. Sometimes the open systems are better, other times the closed ones are. I actually think that if people spent their energy making the open systems better than the closed ones, people would chose the open ones. The fact of the matter is, a lot of people just don't care about or agree with the definition of ""open"" and ""freedom""  that the FSF likes to promote.

And if we want to talk about responsibility and protecting rights...

As a developer, I dislike the constraints the FSF is trying to impose on developers. If I write some code, it's my choice whether I choose to open source it, and what license terms I decide to make it available under. I wouldn't work for a company that had a clause in the employment contract stating that it owned all my IP work or forbade me from releasing any open source. 

Likewise, I sure as hell don't support the FSFs aims to impose restrictions on my rights to produce or work on closed systems, or the rights of fellow developers, be they individuals or companies.

We started out very similar as technically minded computer geeks (he got me started on programming in C and C++ back then; I'd only ever programmed in Basic and Pascal) with the typical social misfit personalities geeks had back then. Today though, on the surface, we couldn't be more different. After college (we went to the same university), he went through some profound changes. He still has some technical interests, but he's much more wrapped up these days in his various alternative lifestyle issues. He's basically a bohemian occasionally gender-bending artsy kind of guy with a gaggle of girlfriends, some in far-flung corners of the country. I'm still the tech geek; I haven't had a girlfriend in the better part of two decades and it's become pretty clear to me that I probably won't touch a female ever again.

But despite life having taken us in such different directions, we're still the same in so many ways, from our minor habits and personality quirks, to the way we look at things. I'm often surprised when we still come up with the same interpretations of things, or the same ideas, and when we find the same things interesting.

If we could operate a 320km/h express train on the 960km Melbourne-Sydney rail corridor at full speed you're looking at a bit over 3 hours from the heart of Melbourne to the heart of Sydney.  Factor in all the stuffing around getting to/from airports and on planes and that's still quicker than flying.

Edit:  I should add that I'm well aware the corridor would need massive upgrades to sustain those speeds.  There's 50 level crossings on the Victorian stretch alone and it's single track in a number of places.

You cannot make this assertion based on this observation. Whether designed or evolved, each individual animal undergoes a developmental process during which parts of the body that are separated in the adult form are right next to each other in the embryo. You cannot say that because this nerve makes a loop, and seems to be inefficiently mapped out, it could not be a ""designed"" feature. It is a consequence of embryology, which happens to be homologous in many species. Homology supports common ancestry/evolution but inefficient cabling in a giraffe is not a good argument against ""intelligent design""

I analyze risk of implementing the requested features, work with the higher powers to decide on a list of things I think can realistically be implemented, work with the product managers to get a feature specification, turn that into a technical specification, discuss and obtain input from the managers, and then reiterate until everyone agrees that the list and specifications are okay.

After that, I settle into a development job either with one of the teams (if one team feels it may be cutting the deadline close) or implementing a feature that would require changes across all of our code bases.

I understand that this wouldn't work in a larger company, but because we're small and have minimal bureaucracy, once the technical specification is agreed on and settled, there's nothing more for me to do on the design/intermediary level.","1288573226"

To me that's a pretty big red flag. The night already sleeping with her ex. However, I don't know all the facts. I will say that you definitely need to communicate with her your need to have space and time for yourself, your friends, and your personal hobbies. Honestly, any reasonable person would understand that people need space from each other. It's especially problematic if you're losing touch with friends.

If you have already tried to communicate with her that it's a real issue in your relationship and she's not doing anythign about it or just getting angry when you suggest such heresy, then it's definitely time to move on for someone who will be with you and respect your space. 

People need to learn to be happy by themselves before being in a relationship and expecting everthing of the other person.

many cities, counties and states have differing tax rates and structures. the best way to look at this is the USA is the EU, the States are the Countries.

It's illegal to knowingly charge the wrong tax rates here. if you overcharge a customer a tax, you're obligated to reimburse the customer. if you undercharge, you're obligated to reimburse the local/state/federal government.

i bet if you rented the exact same car from the exact same company in another state, some of these taxes and fees would change, some would disappear, and possibly others appear in their place.

they're doing you a favor. instead of charging you the highest possible rate for safety, they're charging you the legitimate rate for where you are. they dont like charging these fees, but its obligated, and showing you what THEY charge and what the GOVERNMENT charges is a sort of protest on their part. a way of saying ""look, it'd only cost this much if it wasnt for all these assholes tacking all this other shit on.""","1288573271"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","Thomas Paine's Agrarian Justice (1797) says that the land is common inheritance and nobody should be able to own it. It's a direct precursor to Proudhon's (1809-1865) rejection of ""property"" in favor of ""possession"".

From his *The Rights Of Man*, 1792:
&gt;    Great part of that order which reigns among mankind is not the effect of government. It has its origin in the principles of society and the natural constitution of man. It existed prior to government, and would exist if the formality of government was abolished. The mutual dependence and reciprocal interest which man has upon man, and all the parts of civilised community upon each other, create that great chain of connection which holds it together. The landholder, the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, and every occupation, prospers by the aid which each receives from the other, and from the whole. Common interest regulates their concerns, and forms their law; and the laws which common usage ordains, have a greater influence than the laws of government. In fine, society performs for itself almost everything which is ascribed to government. 

Yes, he's arguing for business and ownership, but at a personal level. This is not even as mercantile as anarcho-capitalism.

Mortenson rejects war and government in favor of community development. Instead of big policies or whatever he goes into places, interacts with the people and works with communities to form voluntary associations. There is no coercion, only a non-violent approach to fixing the world that bypasses government. Dude even rejected Rumsfeld's personal offer for millions to fund his stuff, because he didn't want to smell like military. He never once turned to government agencies. He works to empower women through education.

I'll be happy to justify any of those in the same way. Sectarianism and ideological isolation, the idea that ""This is anarchism and that is not"" weaken and dilute the ideas. You end up with an attenuated movement of college kids, privileged intellectuals and shut-ins, with no interaction with the real world, no common ground with most people, and, therefore, no ability whatsoever to build a movement. You have people who say stupid shit like ""I don't want a movement with people in it who say [insert some ideological puritanism here]"". This reading list is robust, expansive, as is the history behind the idea itself. The best thing to do for building a movement is to expand it, the worst thing you can do to undermine it is to keep neophytes limited to a bunch of nerdy bullshit, and the best thing you can do to chase away new blood is to tell them that whatever inspires them is wrong.

Then again I certainly understand the duality that it brings to my thought process.  There are no ""answer to all questions.""  Everything is a balance, a give and take, good and bad, or advantage vs. disadvantage.  

I'm pro life but not for secular reasons, anti religion reason but for constitutional reasons.  I'm against just about any form of government sponsored welfare but consider charity to be a positive trait amongst people.  I'm more anti-government in all things except national defense and foreign policy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let's just assume that humanity started 10 generations ago with one man and one woman. The first woman must have had at least one daughter so that the next generation could spawn.

That Daughter (Eve-2) had some options depending on how many males were spawned. BUT we know that there are 10 generations of humans. So we know that EVE-2 must have had a daughter. EVE-3 also must have had a daughter so that generation 4 could come into being. ETC ETC. Eventually generation 10 comes along with your mother.

Now what is logically possible here. It is logically possible that every single EVE never had a son (assuming there were other woman floating around giving birth to son's). But, it is not logically possible that every previous eve had no daughters. In fact, every EVE in this chain must have atleast one daughter who manages to breed.

Your mother is the current link on the generation chain. If she has only son's then there is no EVE-11. Other females may have daughters, but this direct chain of EVE1--&gt; Eve-X is over. 

You can get confused by thinking about the other women floating around. It is true they all come from the same original pair, but they are other strands. Many chains have ended with women having only sons or not having any children at all. Your mother represented the longest possible chain of EVEs on the planet. If she does not have any daughters, that chain becomes another broken chain.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","She was bored, he could tell.  No one sat on a bench at 11 at night, dragging a cigarette, listening to Justin Beiber unless they were bored out of their fucking mind.  AND horny.  AND desperate.

There was no one around.  She was a little heavy, round a plump.  But this just made her breasts look perfect.  Large and soft and young and perfect.

Still no one around.  He kept watching her from the street.  ""Essayholmes,"" he said to himself, ""this is YOUR night."" 

He sat next to her in the empty, dark park.  He leaned in.  ""You,"" he said ""have be biggest, most amazing tits I have ever seen.""  She coughed, sputtering on the smoke and stared at him.  ""I beg your pardon,"" she said?

""You heard me,"" Essay replied.  He grabbed her wrist with one hand and yanked the headphones out of her ears with the other.  Beiber inflamed the air.  

The woman gasped.  ""You know you want it,"" Essayholmes said.  One hand began to reach up her shirt.  The woman took deep breaths.  

""Maybe I do,"" the woman said, ""Whats in it for me?""  Essayholmes laughed.

""Just wait and see,"" he said.  He foreced her onto the soft grass by the bench.  He squeezed her large tits firmly.  She gasped and moaned.  ""ouch!""  She said, resistingly slightly.   

""Now, baby,"" he said, ""you like it.  you do.""

She nodded, but not enthusiastically.

""Lets get these pants off,"" he said.  He reached down and roughly unzipped her jeans, forcing them down below her knees.  The sudden exposure of her moist pussy to the night air gave her a start.  It gave him a rush and his penis instantly began to throb.  

He didn't wait to take her pants of.  He flipped her to her side and forced her knees up to her chest.  He placed the tip of his cock on the outside of her pussy.  ""This is gonna be so good, baby"" he said and slammed into her vagina.  She cried out, but not from fear.  

He was rhythmic, wide and long.  His balls slapped against her and his left hand massaged her engorged clit.  She came with a cry, shocked at how she could respond to such a stranger.  

Essayholmes slowed as his cum spilled into her hole.  He quickly zipped his pants, stood and helped the woman up.  She looked at him with shock and gratitude.  

""Told you there was something in it for you,"" he said.  ""The best orgasm of your life.""

He disappeared into the night.","1288573405"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; My friend has been a Freemason for 30 years. He went through the Scottish Rite and Knight Templar path. He told me there was a big split maybe a decade ago or so? I think? ANyways it was regarding the lack of new members (and average old age among members), and the higher ups basically wanted to do a long weekend thing where big groups come over the weekend and at the end they all become Master Masons, removing all the studying and normal stuff you have to learn to get to Master Mason. He said they had so few active members, that sometimes they had to drive hours to help other lodges perform their opening ceremonies.

&gt; tl;dr My mason friend says that the group is slowly dying out due to lack of interest among the youth.

&gt; Have you experienced any of this and what are your opinions? Is this just a local issue?

A few years back, there was a Lodge who started doing these ""fast track"" type of things. Our Grand Lodge had apparently given its blessing for that sort of stuff. My Lodge made it clear that we would have no part of it. 

In my opinion, taking that shortcut not only hurts the candidate, but it hurts his Blue Lodge in the long term. Doing everything in just a day or two takes so much away from the whole experience, and there's honestly no way someone can learn all the language, and ***get it*** in a single weekend.

I don't think it's dying. If anything, membership at my Lodge has grown in the last few years. Lots more people in my age group (and younger) are petitioning for membership.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","But at the same time I feel Progressives do deal deals with individual liberty in that they tries to account for majority tyranny and also are trying to make the playing field more even through legislation by trying to eliminate economic class gaps. I agree that there is too large of a role that government can play but I think everyone can agree there is a needed role.

One thing that bothers me about the other side of the fence, as it were, is this identification of taxes as some evil that needs to be done away with. I think it's little more than pandering to run on a platform of tax cuts. I mean really, who the hell wouldn't want more money in their pocket? It's an impossible position to attack but when you cut taxes down to nothing you start starving government to the point where necessary programs are suddenly seen as wasteful when, if the money was there and the budget was closer to par, no one would even talk about. 

I'm not saying we need to tax the shit out of everyone but if they keep calling for taxes to be cut every single election cycle you end starving needed funding from government, especially when those same people won't ever touch defense spending (Though I don't really see the glorification of the military to be a Libertarian thing all I really have to go on to represent Libertarians in government is what the Republicans claim they are and they show this attitude.) There needs to be some kind of middle ground where one side isn't seen as the 'tax and spend' side and the other the 'slash all the programs' side.","1288573420"

Cobb is the architect and they inhabit his space, which happens to be the city he created while in limbo.  But it can't actually be limbo since they're still lucid.

Only a few moments pass in the level above, at which point Eames (Tom Hardy) uses a defibrillator to bring Robert back while Ariadne wakes up from a combination of falling or the timer expiring or... something.  I can't remember if the mechanism for her character waking up is really made clear.

But Cobb's level definitely wasn't actual limbo.  Everyone was completely lucid and able to wake up.  They had to use the briefcase to share the dream.  When Cobb and Saito are in limbo together, they aren't connected through a machine and aren't immediately lucid.","1288573455"

When science has been wrong in the past, it's usually been a case where there hasn't really been consensus about something, or the correction applies mostly in a new set of cases.

When continental drift was rejected at first, it was felt that there really wasn't enough evidence, even though there wasn't a mechanism for mountain building and rock folding that was generally accepted.

When Einstein came up with relativity, the Newtonian rules of motion and gravity weren't really chucked out.  In fact, they still work great at predicting lots of things.  Relativity means that they're 'wrong,' but to say that Newton's laws are a failure of science couldn't be further from the truth.

If you have no direct experience with the scientific method, I am appalled at the state of education in Ireland.  Try this: mix a bunch of baking soda and vinegar in a big glass.  Then ""pour"" from the glass over a candle.  The carbon dioxide will extinguish the flame.  It'll work every time (if you react enough baking soda).

Belief in the ability of science to generate reproducible results is better called 'confidence based on previous success.'  It *is not* the same as someone's belief that all the species on earth once fit on a boat.  Your belief *is not* blind.","1288573484"

If you are willing to respect your partner's beliefs as long as she respects yours and find an agreement on important issues, I don't see why it'd end up in hating each other.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's so interesting (and depressing) how the less educated (and often less intelligent/informed) on the right can be whipped up to vote so easily, while their counterparts on the left cannot be convinced to vote even if their lives depended on it. 

To turn out the vote of the less-informed on the right, just scapegoat the groups they don't like for all their problems, whip up the fear until they literally think it is life or death, wrap everything in a thin layer of focus-group tested buzzwords, and throw a big flag on it. And importantly, communicate at a grade-school level. 

As we've seen, it works, time and again. Of course, [neurologically, the brains of right-leaning people are scared more easily than those of left-leaning people](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/fearmongering-h/), so going the boogeyman route (Republicans will stomp on you) or even a legitimate fear route (citing anything and everything Republicans propose economically, in healthcare coverage, wages, worker protections, etc) will just not be as effective if done to left-leaning people. Anyone who has tried to convince apathetic left-leaning people of the importance of the outcome of the election on their lives has seen this first-hand, appeals to fear are just not that effective towards left-leaning people. 

I don't know what the answer is to getting the low-information left-leaning vote out, but by process of elimination, it's not fear.

If you have too many tabs, just start a new window, or close ones that you're not using (really, they have bookmarks for that).

Having said that, just watch and see if it seems like she is using. Will power is fluid, so if you love her, be supportive if she is struggling, but sheesh, definitely don't bail on her until you know for certain that she's given up on avoiding her addiction.","1288573552"

Then I looked up and I saw something that looked like it was looking at me. I could hardly breathe, I couldn't move my body at all, I was pretty terrified cuz it felt like it was coming closer...then I tried to scream out and somehow forced my body to respond and I moved my head to the right and closed my eyes shut. Then a bit later I could completely move and just slept on my front [as I usually do], to not risk seeing that things again.

Here's the thing, I don't believe in the existence of ghosts, I've read a bit on sleep paralysis before and I've read that people think they see things and become really scared when they can't move their own body. 

I didn't keep my eyes open in the dark of sleep on my back at all for the next few days but I knew that wasn't a ghost...I just had the first case of sleep paralysis I've ever remembered and I think it was brought on by a large amount of alcohol.

A part of that alcohol consumption was absinthe if that matters...it was one of the first times I'd drank it.

So don't know if that counts as a ghost story then?

tl;dr Got really drunk...had absinthe...experienced very terrifying sleep paralysis when I went to sleep.

This also includes the beam, not just the dot, so it doesn't really have anything to do with the speckle pattern.  I have a hard time resolving it.  If I shine it on a fluorescent material, it is easy to see the dot, but that's because it's no longer UV.  UV is hard to focus on, and that's why I don't understand how it's due to fluorescence in the eye.  It seems like that might work, except in my experience the color is wrong.  The fuzzy blur that I cannot resolve is all the same color.

*edit* I should of course be saying near UV and not UV, since, by definition, UV is not visible.","1288573607"

Just as not everyone can own a BMW. But you must be ""pretty fucking delusional"" if you think everyone has access to education just because public schools exist. Lack of education opportunity happens with public schools, too. Take a look at the DC school system, for instance.

My point was that I'm not sure how the computer algorithms handle a 13th game (i.e. do they normalize it by the number of games?). Right now Sagarin has Boise at #13, but is that due to SOS or the fact that they're only 7-0 instead of 9-0? The Elo system is pretty standard, I guess I could just figure that out myself.

We both know Notch could keep Minecraft in Alpha for the rest of his programming life, adding whatever he feels and still make a boatload of money.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","The scenario as described definitely calls for a reboot. As Mr. Breaktime has explained, Mrs. No has put an indefinite kibbosh on their sex life. 
I'm not saying that sex doesn't make a relationship functional but a lack of it goes a long way in making it disfunctional. 
My suggestion for Mr. Breaktime is to begin to work out a LOT. assuming that he does a good job of it the results can only benefit him physically, while giving him an outlet to release pent up energy 
I also suggested he flirt with other women.I didn't suggest he get as much side as possible. I suggested flirtation because Mr. Breaktime has to get back in shape physically as well as emotionally. Assuming that Mr. Breaktime is being honest and will not cheat flirting is not going to hurt and as he gets more game the situation he is trying to relieve will not seem as hopeless. The more success in flirtation with other women will build Mr. Breaktime's confidence back over time.  At the point where we are now  it's not about getting another woman to sleep with him, as much as building your game to relieve the pressure of going home to Mrs. No saying no. 
Over time as Mrs. No hopefully recovers from her temporary insanity what is the better choice? that she finds a Mr. Breaktime  in good shape with a highschool six pack and a ton of seduction skills, or that Mr. Breaktime stays the same  moping arround the house feeling sorry for himself?

Furthermore, if your girlfriend takes the pill as directed but somehow it doesn't work like it will supposed to, The morning after pill won't help, because it works in a similar way to regular birth control pills. The morning after pills effective rate is around 70%, regular pills 99.9% when taken as directed. 



There are no statistics on the effective rate of both pills combined because that is not the intentioned use of the morning after pill. 



Pregnancy is not a side effect, its the result of birth control failure. However, because the morning after pill is a more concentrated form of hormones, it can have worse side effects than regular birth control. 



Do not use the morning after pill as regular birth control, but keep a pack on hand in case your girlfriend misses pills and has unprotected sex (which she shouldn't but accidents do happen). 


If you are that untrusting of birth control pills, then keep using condoms. That's what they are for. ","1288573671"

Ok.  This we can agree on.  

""Rebels in Boston committed acts of terror on Loyalists. It's nothing new.""

Yes, but that was called patriotism, guerrilla warfare, and (gasp) GOOD.  I wonder why?

""Follow the law
Which law?""

Habeas Corpus, the Declaration of Independence... especially the part where in it states we have the RIGHT and DUTY to dismantle a government that does not listen to our grievances (no trials for US citizens)... yah know the founding documents.  You might want to consider Ben Franklin's quotes as well...but those aren't law.  

""Sorry, it just isn't that easy. Maybe you could hire referee's to blow a whistle when somebody breaks the rules in war. Of course, you might have to hire lot's of them as they get shot.""

Cute.  Really, just cute.  Let me tell you something.  I can NOT support a government that does not respect the least among us and their rights.  That is just me... I am certain more feel the same way.  So when the government NEEDS our support, and it will... times like this always come.... they will be assed out.  Furthermore, I know people that feel they have a duty to protect and defend the Constitution, because it is what makes America, well...AMERICA.  

How can they gain the support of the common people, if they don't adhere to the rules?  If they don't appear to respect the common people and the rule of law?  Are we a nation ruled by laws or by men?  If by laws then does the 14th amendment not apply to all men equally?  If by men, are we truly a republic of, for, and by the people or a dictatorship/ologarchy?  

This is more fundamental then just,""It's war.  War is hell.  Shit happens, deal with it.""  It is, do we allow ourselves to devolve into a dictator/Oligarchic government structure?  And is it really so bad if we fight that de-evolution?  If it is bad, then who is sending this message and what do they benefit to send it?  

As a ""law professor"" you should know better, you should understand the principles at work here better than anyone.  However, above all, you should know that president can NOT declare one an enemy and assign assassination to them, without a declaration of martial law, if they are a US citizen.

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Watching ESPN commentary on the BCS really pisses me off.  I am not even going to complain that Auburn dropped two second (though I disagree with it, I do understand that Oregon played USC while we played Ole Miss), but what I am going to complain about is the fact that the practically ignored that Auburn is in 2nd.

All that we heard was the talk about Alabama moving up if thy win out and how they could play for the championship given the strength of the SEC and how a 1-loss SEC can do that.  This went on for a long time as they talked about Alabama controlling their destiny; practically ignoring Auburn and the fact they we're in the SEC too.

Regardless I have an interesting question, as it stands now if Alabama wins out the ESPN guys (as well as many other people) are confident that they will jump the remaining teams and play in the national championship (lets say against Oregon) regardless of the one loss.

What if LSU beats Alabama (two losses), Auburn loses to Alabama (now Auburn has one loss).  Auburn still goes to the SEC championship and wins.  Now this puts Auburn in the exact same position as Bama would be (just a different loss, admittedly later in the season), but if the argument is a one loss SEC team (Bama) can jump all of these teams and play in the national championship, using this reason shouldn't Auburn in this new case?  I can all but guarantee that you'd see Oregon Boise/TCU/Utah/Someone, and I think this is crap.

Thoughts?

TL;DR: Lots of talk about Alabama going to championship if they win out since a one loss SEC team should go over the non-aq teams. If Alabama loses to LSU, then beats Auburn who then wins the SEC championship shouldn't Auburn go?  This reasoning seems to say so, but I don't think they will.

TL;DR;TL;DR:  Fuck the BCS?  This is dumb lets have a +1 playoff.

I found that getting rid of the visuals really helped once the deed was done. I didn't have to take everything down and cry and reminisce after already breaking up with him. That part was already over.  
After about 3 weeks or so I realized: that was the best decision I've ever made. I've been so much happier and enjoying myself so much that when I do think of him, it's a short ""I hope he's doing well"" and then I move on.

Ok, I agree with you my middle eastern or liberal white guilt (whatever may be the case) friend.

Website has clear calls to action, the demo video is great for people like me who don't know too much about cloud computing. I give the web design a 9/10. The main purpose is to get the website's message across to the average internet viewer who has an attention span of about 3 seconds. Within 1 second of coming to their web page, I immediately clicked the video, watched it and was informed what the website was about.

I would never use a site like this, but if I had a business need that required it, I would most likely convert.

Also, I'm not seeing the same middle eastern connotations that user ""natch"" is seeing. It just sounds like a weird word...not too hard to pronounce. It actually sounds like some sort of Japanese. NASUNI BRING GOOD LUCK TO YOUR BUSINESS SUPER HAPPY FUN TIMES!!","1288573739"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Urrrrrrrrrrr, it had little to do with christianity and much more to do with the ongoing British rule of 1/4 of this little rock in the North Atlantic. 

In the 1960s Catholics in N.Ireland had limited civil rights, including a fucked up voting system that put the power in the hands of traditionally loyalist protestants, who owned a disproportionate percentage of businesses, housing and land, and also constituted &gt;99% of the police. A popular civil rights movement (calling for 'one man one vote' among other reforms) was stomped upon by the government at the time (including the shooting of 13 unarmed civilians on Bloody Sunday), which led to a the outbreak of violence, an influx of British troops, the collapse of the local govt, and the setting up of paramilitary organisations in reaction to tit-for-tat violence and attacks and the shit generally hitting the fan. 

That situation grumbled on for 30+ years, the core motivation for the conflict being the restoration 
of a United Ireland on one side, and a reaction to that violence on the  other by loyalist groups and the police. The primary targets for the IRA were, most of the time, military and police personnel, but the fuckers weren't adverse to bombing clothes shops or small village town centers, either. 

Religion had little to do with it- it was a conflict over civil rights that escalated and was fueled by religion and the issue of British rule. We'd been trying to boot them for 400 years.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","I completely agree with you. I think Notch came up with a great idea for Minecraft by adding the survival aspect to it. Then came the multiplayer. Those two features are what made the game as popular as it is today. By focusing on those two things I think Notch would appeal to the majority of players. Because he ignored those two features is the reason a lot of people are raging. Notch has given us a taste of an awesome game with huge potential. Personally, I am hoping for other talented programmers to work on clones and implement a lot of the ideas the community wants. This game needs competition in order to drive up innovation and keep Notch on his toes. This is precisely the reason he needs to cater to the community and do it with haste. Once a clone comes out with a team of talented developers behind it pumping out feature after feature, Notch will lose a big part of the community. Even worse, if a free open source version comes out before Notch releases the final version of this game, he wont make much profit thereafter. 

I love Minecraft, but I am dissapoint at this update. ","1288573796"

I don't agree that the person attempting to burn the Koran had his speech suppressed, so that might in fact be where our major disagreement lies.  In fact, I think the fact that his Koran was stolen means his position is heard to a wider audience.  If that hadn't happened, no one would be talking about it at all.  His voice was heard and heard loudly.  There was *opposition* to his message, not suppression.   ","1288573836"

* yeah, you can fit no problem additional RAM. 8GB is max. But similar to what you already have: DDR2 800MHz

* RAM does not affect HD playback much, with 2GB you'll be fine. And you can try to play HD video even if you don't have full HD monitor. You will not have full benefit of it, but you will see if there are any problems. If there are try using VLC player.

* sure OC rocks, especially with this old core2duo. We have home E8200 which is 2666 stock at 3600 with a cooler that cost ~18€(arctic freezer 7)

* F3 is popular and often even claimed as fastest. Though its not true, its close ^^ and just show how favorite it is among users.

Omega's build is kinda terrible. You would gain 2 more cores but performance core vs core they would probably not be as fast as your OC CPU(can probably test it if you do [superPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_PI) and then look for some athlon results on the web) not many programs can use more than 2 cores, I have no idea how it is when it come to video editing, I know that CPU is the main worker there but dunno how it is with cores. You would buy new MOBO, but with old DDR2 RAM? Whats the point of that? Why 6GB is mystery to me, because he kinda took approach to that PC as a media center, which is fine and dandy with 2GB.

But in the end he made a good tip. GPU; Disk; RAM I add that maybe cooler if that arctic wont give...

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Interesting -- glad I never took him up on any of his suggestions.

I am doing my own research on the guy (and George4title), but I must say it's definitely an entertaining process to learn about this group.

Their last recommendation was to buy MCO Jan 25$ put options -- that recommendation came out on Oct 15, so I loaded up thinkorswim and did some investigating on the chart.  The put options were trading at $1.40 that day -- remember this price.

Now, assuming that what they said is true -- that ""NIA's President"" did indeed buy 150 put options -- then in the past 3 months, there were only **2** days where volume hit 150.  Not only that, but it wasn't until October 4-October 8 that the options finally came below $1.40.  Even from a retarded standpoint, it doesn't make sense to buy some security at or above the price you start hyping it up.

The *only* day that I can imagine that they actually bought 150 put options was October 14th.  There were 1,960 put options traded that day (an astounding spike, considering the daily average volume was probably less than 20), but nonetheless the options opened at $1.31 that day and spikes to $1.48, a modest 13%. Over the course of the next couple days the put options hit a high of $1.56, seeing moderate volume of 300-1000 contracts per day.  

Let's assume that what he said was true, that they did buy 150 contracts of MCO Jan $25 put options, and let's assume he got in at *excellent* prices that match available volume.  He must have gotten the contracts at $1.31.

150 contracts * $1.31 per contract * 100 shares per contract = $19,650. This is ""NIA's President""'s initial investment and it's a decent chunk of money to put on the line.

Let's assume that he got out at the perfect time, $1.56, for the moment that it spiked.  Remember, that's the highest the options have been since they recommended them.

150 contracts * $1.56 per contract * 100 shares per contract = $23,400.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Everyone picks and chooses their own morals. There is no objective universal ethical system.

As a Christian what do you believe?  There is a God and he wants you to behave a certain way?  God is the objective ethical system and the Bible is his instruction.

&gt;Why do the miracles have to be true or false? What if the miracles in the biblical narrative are just narrative that have more meaning than true or false.

Maybe Jesus' resurrection is metaphorical also? Maybe God and the Christ were just metaphors? Either they're real or they're not. Either the miracles happened or you're reading a fantasy novel.

Maybe you just *like* the moral lessons of Jesus' teachings? Well that's fine.  There are many religious figures and texts throughout history with good lessons for humanity - but you don't consider yourself a Buddhist or Hindu if you simply agree with much of their morality.

It's the belief that your morality should be shaped to match the teachings.  That the clear teachings/texts should not be overwritten by personal opinion because (in the Abrahamic religions) they stem from an objective truth (will of God).  

&gt;What does it mean for the Bible to be the ""Word of God."" 

Depends on your definition of God.  According to the historical Abrahamic religious sense it means that the Bible is divinely inspired direction of how appease God.

&gt;The narrative given in the Gospel of John calls Jesus the Logos and in turn word of God. Are you implying that since I'm a Christian I should believe God wrote the Bible?

I'm implying that to be a Christian (in any meaningful sense of the word) you should be of the opinion that there is a God and that the Bible is his instruction manual to humanity of right and wrong. See above.","1288573908"

Until people realize they are perpetually surrounded by people that are affected by their word choice, they will continue to believe that no one is being hurt directly or indirectly. If someone is ignorant enough to believe that prejudice is acceptable when the minority party is absent, then they are ignorant enough to rationalize their rhetoric by assuring themselves that the minority is, in fact, not present when they deliver their inflammatory remarks. We do exist, and until people have that served to them on a plate, they never actually have realize the extent of the damage their voiced opinions hold. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt, and a few dead gays in places that most people couldn't pin on the map isn't going to convince our neighbors that this is an issue they should lose any sleep over.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","&gt; So delete 1 and 2 and there you go you have expected portal behavior.


That doesn't work. When you go through the Nether portal, you always arrive in the same normal world portal because several portals can fit in a single chunk, and point to the same Nether portal, but the code will always choose a single one to return to (probably South/West rule or something). If you created three next to each other and going back through the Nether portal brings you to any of them, it was just luck. It means the coordinates in the Nether realm were not in a position where it was obstructed, so the Nether portal didn't have to be shifted, and thus will not create a new portal in the normal world when travelling through it.


If you put three portals next to each other, and all of them pointed to the same Nether portal, but that portal has been offset to due an obstruction or ""unsafe"" area, going back through the Nether portal will still bring you out in a ""random"" position above ground (not actually random, as it's based on its shifted coordinates).


The only way to solve this is to remove the obstruction or ""unsafe"" area for the portal in the Nether, so that when it's created, it links back to the chunk your portal is on in the normal world.","1288573927"

There's *no* required thought or belief to be an atheist, apart from a lack of belief in gods. That's part of why it's *so hard* to organize atheists to do anything at all - why it's so often compared to herding cats.

There's some degree of common thought (because many of us arrive at similar answers), but atheism is not a cohesive philosphy - or indeed a philosphy at all. 

Just watch us here, we argue all the time. I am surprised when I find a few people I agree with more than 80% of the time here.
 
The nice thing about hanging around with atheists is that so many of them become *used* to disagreement and don't fear it. We can disagree strongly and *still* get on. This is also partly related to the scientific viewpoint that many atheists adopt - changing your mind in the light of evidence is not only acceptable but expected. Changing your mind is not a sign of weakness, but of strength. When this happens with religious groups, they split (which is why there's more than 38000 christian denominations). When it happens to atheists, they're *all still atheists*. They're just atheists who don't agree about something. Well *of course* we don't agree.

Does that mean there can't be groupthink in meetings of a particular group? Well of course there can, but there's less acceptance of it - it's less common, and atheist groups tend to survive diversity of opinion better in its absence.

Similarly the whole point of this story is the fact that you don't know what happened. The strength of the story is in the telling and not in the infinite number of arbitrary endings that you could tack on to the end. In fact, you could argue that the story is set up in such a way that no ending will ever ""fit."" Lots can be made up but none will ever feel right.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is no national rape law in the United States, so I cannot say for certain as to all fifty states, however it is frequently trumpeted on college campuses that intoxication = inability to consent. If both parties are intoxicated then neither can consent, so no rape is committed. 

[Here's the Ohio law](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2907.02)

see section A.1.c.

&gt;(c) The other person’s ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the other person’s ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age.

Intoxication falls under a physical condition.

edit: As far as couples who consent while both are drunk, that falls under the ""...knows or has reasonable cause..."" and involves another law, [here](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2901.21).

Note section C

&gt;(C) Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.

That means that someone who is intoxicated *can* commit a rape, but only if it's proven that they weren't in any state of mind to realize what they were doing. Considering how much gray area is in the law, it's a safe bet that they wouldn't (realize what they were doing). Further, considering that a rape can only be prosecuted successfully with the witness testifying that they were raped, there is no crime in two intoxicated individuals having consensual sex. There's a ton of gray area in here, I know.","1288573972"

&gt; I have already backed up my claim as to why atheism is irrational.

The claim I was referring to was: God exists. 

In any case the only thing you mentioned was that if atheism is correct then everything is permissible. This is not a response to atheism. You are uncomfortable with the idea that everything is permissible. That doesn't mean it's not so.

&gt; Then you aren't an atheist. You're an ignorant agnostic.

Sigh.

Theism: Belief in a god.
Atheism: Non-Belief in a god.

Clear things up?

&gt; One cannot make the same claim about God since God is outside the natural order.

So what ""reality"" do you use to prove a god exists? Prove that there is something outside of the ""natural order"". 

&gt; That is clear from his personal writings.

Any quotes from those personal writings?

&gt; In any case atheism doesn't demand that one should not be a social Darwinist or perpetrating genocide.

You are correct. There is no dogma in atheism. It's simply a non-belief in a god. You can believe whatever else you want aside from that.

The only huge tip I'd have is to find out what technologies and languages the employer is looking for, read up on and learn the basics of as many as possible, make them stand out as keywords in your resume and cover letter, and be sure to attach sample code that uses them.

I'm pretty sure this is how I got my jobs. Any good programmer will be able to pick up enough basics of a new language or library to make a sample program in less than a day.

You can't just leave the fat on the duck because it's just a layer of fat - really gross - and taking the fat off dries it out. You could probably sear the fat on the chicken too but it's always been moist for me without it. 

Brine them all overnight. This makes a huge difference in the flavor.

I personally use two different stuffings and a dressing. I change it up every year but so long as you just keep with harmonic flavors, you're fine. I usually do apple, walnut, fennel, yams, and the like. The only thing I really would not suggest is any type of seafood. I've tried it and never liked it very much. 

I don't use a whole lot of spices or rubs. It's a flavorful dish all by itself - especially if you do the different stuffings/dressings - and it can be a little overwhelming to factor in rubs. Whatever I'm using in my stuffing/dressing, I flavor the meat with. 

My best pieces of advice: Thaw the meat! Don't try shoving a boning knife in there when it's frozen solid. You'll cut your hand off and nobody likes to go to the ER during the holidays. And buy a good boning knife. You're going to be up to your elbows in poultry for the better part of an afternoon, don't cheap out on the equipment.

Also, having married someone who is young doesn't automatically make you a pedophile, since his reason for marrying her did not appear to have anything to do with sexual desire.

Morality may sound simple, but people end up disagreeing about it anyway.  I would never marry a woman who drank alcohol or gambled.  Many people will avoid spouses like that, or if they don't, they will later despise and/or divorce their spouse because of such issues.  Those are examples of moral values.

Islam doesn't have tribal nature because it doesn't discriminate based on nationality or ethnicity.  Any human being can become Muslim, and it is an association based on your conscience.  As Martin Luther King Jr stated clearly, people should be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.  If you think people should not be judged by the content of their character, so be it, but that's what Islam is about.

The reason people kill each other in Muslim countries stems from a variety of problems, poverty being the most significant among them.  It wasn't that long ago when most Christian nations were even more violent.  The killings that go on between Muslims is rather small compared to the genocides committed by the Christians as late the Jewish holocaust during the mid 20th century.

"science","t5_mouw","I think in a sense, we're both right. What we're really debating at this point is whether a rainbow is red or green!

Look, I'm not hating the religious. I'm not even a militant atheist, nor am I dogmatic about my atheism. People can believe what they want to, and I have no intention of raining on someone else's parade, so long as they don't rain on mine - this is really the foundation of the social contract.

Some people use religion as an excuse. Others on the hand genuinely believe they're doing the work of god. Whatever the reason, a building with a plane in it is still a building with a plane in it. Religious extremism exists in all religions, but even moderates can go about wielding their beliefs in order to oppress others (I'll come back to this in a paragraph or so).

Religion does stifle innovation. I'm hammering stem-cell research because of its potential as being the greatest medical therapy of all time, and because it's hated on by proponents of the bible because of it has ties with abortion. Religion and science aren't mutually exclusive, but what you've got to remember is that in those times, being irreligious was so reprehensible that you'd be persecuted, cast-out, or even killed. As we move forward the number of scientists who are religious is shrinking, and it believe it's under 10%.

Religion itself hasn't contributed to science; some religious people have contributed to science, but a that's different to the religion itself.

I know of plenty too. Some religious people are more accepting than others. Then again we have neo-conservatives who are fighting to keep DOMA, DADT, and other hateful legislation on the books because their bible says being gay is so wrong there's a special place where they'll burn for ever and ever. And plus, there are a lot of religious people that genuinely do believe that gay marriage will undermine their own; I don't believe they're right, but then again, they don't believe I'm right either.

Believe me, I'm all for gay marriage and equal rights. Without religion, people are still people. People are sometimes good, othertimes bad. However, religion, to some, is like a catalyst that brings out the worst in them.

I'm not closed minded, and I'm enjoying this discussion and all the others I'm having on this topic here. But perhaps I could ask you to widen your worldview just a little to the harm that's been incited by religion?","1288574063"

I tried various ways to find my friends (including borrowing the phone of a helpful redditor!), none of which worked. I ended up hanging out by the DonorsChoose tent and resigned myself that if I couldn't find any of my friends by sundown, I'd borrow a phone and take a cab back to where I was staying, since I'm not a fan of walking around alone in cities I've never been to before. One (out of 3) of my friends just happened to walk by and I got his attention. The two of us started walking back to the shuttle stop. Both of us were pissed that our other friends were nowhere to be found and had caffeine headaches from lack of coffee that morning to make matters worse. 

A few blocks from our destination, we forced our way through a group of people who were taking up the entire sidewalk. We got a few yards down the road when the crowd started cheering. I looked back to see none other than Dr. Stephen Colbert himself heading towards a black SUV. I raised my sign (which featured a large Reddit coat of arms). From his SUV, Dr. Colbert pointed at me and said ""THAT IS AWESOME!"". I shouted something stupid like ""Thank you so much!"" back. He then drove away and my friend and I kept walking.

"cats","t5_2qhta","Definitely post flyers and knock on doors - leave notes with a description and your phone number - people will call if they've seen a cat that looks like yours.

Check online sites under Lost and Found or Pets (Craigslist in my city has a hopping section with supportive and helpful folks).

Walk around the neighborhood at dusk and call his name.  If he has a favourite treat, shake the can/bag.  Or if he likes the sound of the can-opener, bang it on a can while you walk around and call him.  He may be hiding and come out when he hears you, or if he is in a closed garage or shed, you might be able to hear him meow.

One of our kitties once went missing for 2 and a half weeks - we did all these things, but the thing that brought her home was her microchip.  She had wandered 3.5 miles away, walked into a fellow cat-lover's home, and the homeowner took her to the local vet to be scanned.  I know this doesn't help if Kittycat is not chipped, but when he does come home I highly recommend it!  It's a cheap and simple procedure and well worth it!

My heart goes out to you - I know how worrying it is.  What helped me with the worry was to make a plan and checklist and one by one cross off each step - flyers on power poles, knock on doors (in an increasing radius around home), post ads online, check with your county/municipal animal shelter, post flyers at local vet clinics and pet stores.

The WebM development community is undoubtedly smaller than that of the various MPEG implementations.  Thus the bitstream and code are comparatively smaller, simpler, and less sophisticated.

But all that is moot, because even if x264 were the best video encoding implementation ever possible to invent, it would still be subject to a raft of industry patents, making it unusable for a large portion of the world's population.","1288574085"

Thanks for these responses, I thought maybe I was crazy and these were normal things a person deals with in a relationship.

Let me stress one thing though, she is a great girl. She does a lot for me. I'd say at least 3 times a week she brings me food or coffee while I'm at work as a surprise, and she drives my car-less ass all over the place when I need to. Also, a few months ago I had a probation violation (stupid college related offense, nothing serious at all) and the asshole judge sent me to prison. This was the lowest point in my life, I had never been in a situation this bad in my entire life. She called my parents when I didn't return from court and they bailed me out in 24 hours. If it wasn't for her, I could've been there for 3 days rather than 1 terrible day. 

That's what I'm struggling with. I know it's good for me to end this relationship, I'm just not sure how she is going to react, and I really don't want to hurt her after she's done so much for me. ","1288574107"

Use a condom. If you are over age of majority, go to your local sex shop and ask what is best for sensitivity. If you are not, go to the drugstore and buy a regular Trojan. Either way, get used to them. because I expect you to have a long, healthy sex life, and that includes protecting yourself and your partners from STIs. Best to get used to them right from the start.

As long as you are showering with soap and rinsing properly, every day, and washing your groin area before sex, the smell you're smelling during sex is normal. You're going to have to get used to that hormone smell. She's probably going to have cleaned herself up to the eyeballs but she's going to have a hormone smell to and that's totally normal. It's part of being a primate and you'll probably find it turns you on. If not, then, at least give yourself time to get used to it. If it's REAALLLLYYY SUPER BAD, like rotten fish left in a dumpster of garbage in the sun, that means there's a situation a doctor needs to look at.

Don't bother measuring your penis. My vagina does not contain a ruler. I am more interested in my partner making me feel cherished, desired, sexy, and loved. He looks into my eyes and touches my boobs and plays with my clit and rubs my pussy lips and kisses me so deep when he's inside me. And I've been married to my man for a long while and I couldn't tell you how many inches he has if I had a gun to my head. All I know is that he holds hands with me in my sleep and he always makes sure I come first.

Do go down on her first. Then do it again. If she's come two or three or four times, she's not going to mind if you happen to be a quickshot on your first outing.

She may bleed. Then again, if you have her super hot and open with several orgasms and fingers and tongue, she may be flexible and stretched. Either way, if you're worried, lay down on a towel if it eases your mind.

- You already have a girlfriend or a wife

- Nobody ever comes in your hair

- It happens at a Holiday Inn Express?

If shit gets real, then say, ""How would you feel if I went to see that woman down the street for two hour full body massages?""

It's very easy, watch. You said:

&gt;The point of Zheng He is that when he set sail in massive ships even by today's standards, the West hadn't even discovered the dry dock. When Columbus set sail 200 years later, his ships were still puny and inadequate compared to Zheng He, who was able to circumvent the globe 200 years earlier while spreading trade and culture. Many historians believe it was the arrival of his Treasure fleet in Europe which started the renaissance.

Wrong again. The West had used [dry docks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drydock) for over 2000 years. If anything, it was China that was lagging because they only discovered them 1000 years ago.

Columbus sailed only 60 years after Zheng He, not 200. There is no evidence to support Zheng He traveled to Europe. There is no evidence that his large treasury ships got past China, were seaworthy in the open ocean, or were anything beyond ""pageant ships"". And now we know that Zheng He did not *circumnavigate* the world because *Chinese thought the world was flat well into the 17th century.* Whoops!","1288574168"

I would find it hard to question a theist on why he believes his beliefs, when I honestly can't answer that myself. Yes I can say the scientific method is consistent and I belief in that, but then he could also claim the vast number of theologians are worth the same value as the scientific community, especially if the community is in disagreement, there are errors in the theories, and there are religious within the community.

I guess it's just the realisation that my favourite argument for converting theists, the ""why do you believe that"" approach, is a slightly hypocritical and biased argument, which is what I'm annoyed about.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You might need to, dare I say it, have a heart to heart with her about this issue. She needs to understand that you are NOT the other guy! When us women get out of crappy relationships it can take a long time to heal. We need our man to be patient, my husbands Uncle got married to a lovely woman. It took him the first 6 years or so of their marriage for him to convince her she was beautiful all because one nasty relative of hers made a comment on her looks. Women are deeply wounded when not loved and thought of as beautiful, genuinely beautiful. A lot of men don't have a freaking clue what they do to us when they put us down. I don't care if the woman isn't prettier than the mud on your shoes it doesn't mean you talk crap to her.

I was in a class with a bunch of partying pothead guys who, to be honest, I shouldn't have been bothered by. I mean these were lousy men who objectified women, I didn't tell them this of course but still. So anyways, they decided to list all the girls in the class and rate them on a scale of one to ten. One guy gave me a seven and everyone else a zero. Then one guy crossed out the 7 and wrote down,"" Are you f-ing kidding me??!!!"" That list was dropped on a desk and I found it as class was ending. Can you imagine how I must have felt? I know I'm not Halle Barry, Kate Beckinsale, or Angelina Jolie but I certainly didn't deserve that. My father didn't always like that I dressed like a tomboy and he would make little comments about it and give me looks that just spoke disappointment and it hurt me deeply. It hurt me to my very core and when I met the man I was to marry we had to overcome those barriers in my life...we still are. I know that women putting men down is not cool as well believe me. I'm not saying we should do that at all! It's just different for girls..it hurts on a completely different level. 

I know that generally digging into a girls heart like that is uncomfortable but she needs you right now. If the last guy was an ass than you need to know how she feels about things and how you can help her move past it. Ask her how you should compliment her, tell her that she isn't allowed to disagree with you because you aren't the other guy you're you and you deeply care for her. Tell her to stop talking negatively about herself because what she's doing is what my counselor calls self-abuse. She's putting herself into that hole and keeping herself there. Ask her how she'd like to be approached and flirted with. My man and I still have a ways to go, to be honest when I see a beautiful girl walk past us..I get jealous. I've felt hate build up in my heart because I know she's pretty and my man might look her way and think so too. That's not his fault, men are supposed to adore women and a woman's body you're programmed that way. I know my husband would NEVER cheat on me or continue to stare at her or flirt or anything but that doesn't mean it doesn't make me hurt at times. I'm doing my best to not be jealous I don't like this in myself and it's unattractive I know. I look how I look and he chose me, he comes home to me and sleeps in my bed. Even though I know all of this and your gf knows all the wonderful things about you that she does..it doesn't always make everything okay.

No your point doesn't remain valid. Near to 1/4 of all recipients are/were Jewish (by religion). An even greater amount were Christian and members of other faiths. A much lower amount of professed atheists have taken the prize and in any case such metrics are nonsense as not all have equal access to education or other enfranchisement. You're trying to beef up a number as though it means something other than what it means. It's the same fallacious reasoning which would apply an IQ test designed for American children to Japanese children or children from various African countries.  Access to modern resources is what restricts reaching higher-levels of education and higher-modes of thought. This is why most of these scientists are from first-world countries with generally abundant access to resources/education/funding/etc.

The thing about burqa laws is that they're both rather blatant discrimination against women and imply an utter lack of trust in the ability of men to control their desires.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I haven't been following events in Wellington closely for very long, so I can't really talk about the specifics you are referring to. However, to explain what you are asking me about, I would say that it's partisan to bicker in the way you two are doing. I honestly think it shows a lack of perspective. Let me explain why.

Over the past few years, I've been canvassing the mindset and affairs of different countries, by spending a season with each nation's television media (which I can stream over the net). What I've seen, is that in each of these countries I've studied, people seem to be very engaged in a wrestling contest between their left and right wing groups. Yet, as an outsider, I can see that there honestly isn't much difference between MPs or legislators of the left and right wings. They're really all doing the same project of running the nation's affairs, and they're working together on it. In debates they will try to highlight differences of policies which their team proposes. However, when it comes to how the MPs see the world, there's not much difference. 

Notwithstanding this, in New Zealand, because of proportional representation, you do indeed have a wide scope of opinions. But I still see disingenuous political rhetoric when I watch events on the floor of your parliament building in Wellington. I have no patience for Phil Goff's tirades about this and that. However, neither do I have patience for people throwing mud at Labour. One thing that really sets John Key apart, in my estimation, is that he doesn't do that. He's really a gentleman.

The most decided differences I've seen, are those you can witness when comparing the elected officials of different nations. Aussie MPs (and its government/executive) are very different from Kiwi elected officials, who in turn are different from the Canadian MPs in Ottawa and British MPs in London. This research has also given me perspective on my own nation of the USA, which obviously has the most foolish elected officials of all. There isn't much difference between the elected Democrats and Republicans. However, there is a wide gap in the mindset and attitude of the grassroots base that works to elect each group.","1288574231"

"aviation","t5_2qhu8","I'm a student pilot, but also a realist. Take or leave my advice as you wish.

You mentioned in a comment that you'd be looking to get to A&amp;P as a way to save cash. Honestly, I think you should reevaluate that idea. What I'm finding in aviation is to never go into it with the idea that you'll ""save money"" by doing x or y. Example: Getting your own plane as opposed to renting? You buy your own plane because you want to own your plane and go places on your own schedule, not because it's cheaper. Same thing applies to getting an A&amp;P. It's not really a career path you choose because the money is good.

Apprenticing is going to take a while longer than school, and school is going to run you several thousands of dollars. The amount of money you'll save by being an A&amp;P will be majorly offset by the amount of money you're putting into the plane in the first place.

There is no cheap way to own an airplane; it just isn't going to happen. You as a private pilot are allowed to do a good chunk of the preventative/routine maintenance stuff; see FAR Part 43 if you haven't gotten that far yet in your training. You only really need to be an A&amp;P to do things to your airframe or your powerplant.

That all being said... you've said that you'd be looking to do an A&amp;P because you'd like to. If THAT is your primary driver, and not the dubious cost savings connected to your piloting time, then go get it done (but finish your private pilot's certificate first, for pete's sake!)","1288574233"

Awww, I understand you get confused, but questions usually end with one of these **?**, hope it helps.

&gt; Why I am saying that this scientific research about happy religious people is not true? 

Okay, let me get this right, scholars from two major universities, backed by a well known scientific journal, published by the universities themselves, wildly quoted and published in many nations and one guy on the internet having read one quote is convinced they made a *mistake*? Excuse me while I laugh at your stupidity.

Pay for the article, it will prove you wrong, in actuality, I can quote it for you, but I want you to contribute to the scientific community, please, go ahead and get the research study done, your numbers are very off and do not coincide with the documents before me.

&gt;You can not say that all believers are happier.

They weren't saying that genius, they said something completely different:

&gt;Are there brain differences
between believers and nonbelievers? Here we show that
religious conviction is marked by reduced reactivity in the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a cortical system that is
involved in the experience of anxiety and is important for
self-regulation. In two studies, we recorded electroencephalographic
neural reactivity in the ACC as participants
completed a Stroop task. Results showed that stronger
religious zeal and greater belief inGodwere associatedwith
less firing of the ACC in response to error and with commission
of fewer errors. These correlations remained strong
even after we controlled for personality and cognitive
ability. These results suggest that religious conviction provides
a framework for understanding and acting within
one’s environment, thereby acting as a buffer against anxiety
and minimizing the experience of error.

**You fail at even understanding what the research was about, that's stunningly idiotic.**

&gt; Used it, sorry, no answer found. Closest to an answer was you saying ""Dammit, what Noah?

Can you provide that answer where I said the word ""Dammit"", otherwise I'll await your apology for lying.

&gt;are you stupid or something? One. Simple. Question. Answer it.

Actually, I'm not stupid, I did answer it, but good luck trying to prove me wrong on that too.

But I think 2 soldiers could take down a heavy and his medic if the soldiers know what they're doing. It's 2v2, and that's not OP. Soldier/Demo against a Heavy in a 1v1 could also go either way.

Edit: I don't think Heavy is OP in general, but if he's attacking on Payload with a pocket medic and the cart, then yes, he's OP, because he has constant healing and his medic is a lot more durable as well. I also think the Natascha Heavy is OP because assuming he has backup, the other team is very likely going to get slaughtered. But here?

Next best bet is to check your starter. It is probably the culprit. You probably knocked it a little loose so now either it's not engaging properly or something else is up. It's relatively easy to get to. The best thing you can do is see if you can get under there with a small ratchet and some smaller sockets. I think it takes like 1/2'' and something else. You might need a really small extension bar if your socket is too short for the ratchet to get on there. Just make sure when you are unscrewing it you don't run into part of the car and get your ratchet stuck between it and the starter. 

Actually, fuck all that. Just take it to firestone and give them 20 bucks and say 'I think my starter is fucked up. Can you check that and my engine mount'.  .. . give them this whole story about how you do most of the work on your car and you don't have much money. I'd be almost willing to put money on the fact that it's your starter. If this is the case, you might be in some serious luck.

Your starter should cost about 75-80 bucks. It is possibly the easiest thing to take off and put on a car, especially on fords. (The Nissan Armada actually has it inside the engine bay area so you actually have to take off the head pieces or something just to get to it....). So if we are lucky you might be looking at some minor aesthetic issues and an 80 dollar starter you can put in yourself within the hour. ","1288574324"

I have to disagree somewhat. Yes Christianity is what it is today, and believers believe the things they believe, but it doesn't mean that the Bible has to be understood and interpreted through their eyes. Or as Jesus said in Luke 6:39 *""Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?""*.

&gt;The bible is full of shit from an objective stance.

My point was that there are ample references as ideas to indicate that the Bible is not to be taken literally from Genesis to Revelation as it talks about ""spiritual truths in spiritual words"". Not sure where people get that the Bible should be interpreted literally from, but I know that Jews, for example, do not interpret Genesis literally, and if you ever read an analysis by a Jews of Genesis you would be surprised at the symbolism and meaning of the story from their point of view. The Jews, and the Hebrew people were accustomed of such stories to learn lessons from, not to be taken literally as how things happened.

"math","t5_2qh0n","&gt; To find the area of an arbitrary simple 2D polygon, all you need to do is find the position vectors of each of its vertices

More generally, for a plane figure with boundary `s`, the area can be given as [; \frac{1}{2} \int_s x dy - y dx ;], which, in particular, gets all sorts of useful when `s` is a parametrized plane curve.

More generally yet, you have the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence of some function `f` in the closed interior of a body, to a surface integral over the boundary.  If you have some scalar function happening over the interior, you can write it as an integral over the surface by coming up with a vector function whose divergence equals your scalar function.

E.g., let's say you're looking for the volume, so just write `f(x,y,z) = x`, or `f(x,y,z) = (x+y+z)/3`, or something along those lines, now `div(f)=1`, and you can compute the volume by just integrating `f` along the boundary.

There's a nice intuitive way to look at all of this:  if you imagine that some sort of substance is contained in the volume, and that it's exiting and entering the volume in an integrable fashion, then computing the flux at the boundary can be related to the amount of the substance contained in the volume.

I'm sure a 'voternet' could be created with better security than electronic voting machines.

Keeping to this train of thought, the 'next' system may simply be a return to original democracy-people all across the nation connected and able to vote instantly and make their voices heard. The internet also allows for better education on political issues than we've ever had before. Our education system will have to be reformed before anything else, but once we have a population capable of critical thinking we just may be able to govern ourselves.

Ignorant? I gave you half a dozen hadith explicitly supporting the death penalty for apostates. Your response? ""Well, that's one interpretation."" 

People actually get *murdered* for leaving your religion, and that's the best you've got. People get *murdered* for what your religion considers practicing witchcraft (sihr), and you're fully oblivious. People get *murdered* for choosing their sexual partners in defiance of your religion, and your response is that in any society, criminals are punished.

And note that these things don't just accidentally happen by the hands of Muslims. These things happen because they're explicitly mentioned in the core texts of your religion.

You, meanwhile, do what religious people have done for thousands of years: you pick those things you agree with and cherish them as the ""word of God"", while attributing the other things to ""misinterpretations"".

Liberals are the ones who brought race into question with regards to the rallies, so you would think their rallies would have such a statistically higher percentage of minorities that it would be obvious.  Well it wasn't.

Add to that that a VAST majority of minorities are liberal, and you would naturally EXPECT there to be fewer at a Glen Beck rally. 10x more blacks identify as democrats than republicans.  Twice as many hispanics identify as democrats than republicans.","1288574416"

I guess we disagree on what requires a name.  Do you think something like:

    close_socket(socket);
    free(buffer);

requires a function like:

    UTIL_CloseSocketFreeBuffer(socket *s, char *buffer) {}

because I don't, even if I have 4 return points in a function (which I really, really try to avoid).  I have no problem c/p that code 4 times in that function.  I really have more of a problem with 4 return points, I'd probably refactor in that case.  Furthermore, if I'm cleaning up more than a few things in a function, it's probably worth refactoring in that case too.  But besides all that, coming up with names for all this crap is irritating.  What if you have multiple sockets or multiple buffers?  What if there's sockets, buffers, files, AND connections?!?!?!

&gt;There are Jewish racists like there are racists from any other background or ethnicity. 

Never said there wasn't. 

&gt;Being a Jew doesn't automatically make you racist nor because of their 'history' as you put it make them more racist than any other particular ethnic group. 

Maybe, but apparently, you do not understand the built in biases that the Jews have against the goyim (gentiles). For example, there are ancient talmudic laws which state that a Jew cannot charge another Jew interest when he loans him money, but a Jew can charge as much interest to the goyim. And there are many other examples like this. You can read all about it if you want in Henry Ford's [The international Jew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Jew)

&gt;Making generalizations like that however does a racist make.

No, but I can see why the uninformed like yourself would say that. I am not making generalizations, I am stating facts. I have lived for many years with Jews and have many Jewish friends, and while they would never admit any of this to you, they have admitted to me, in unguarded moments, that the Jews share a Jewish brotherhood and solidarity against the goyim. This brotherhood and solidarity has been forged through thousands of years of oppression that no other race can has, not even African-Americans. (I'm not racist about it, if anything, I'm jealous of it. No other race has this kind of solidarity)","1288574446"

Your problem is keeping up a consistent macro during and after an attack. Spend more, and spend more often. Don't let minerals sit in the bank. Hotkey your gateways and robo to something easy to reach (I prefer 5) and just make a habit of reflexively hitting it every now and then to see if it's still building anything or cooling down.

&gt;The bacterium had also been observed in 1979 by Australian pathologist Robin Warren, who did further research on it with Australian physician Barry Marshall beginning in 1981...In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by infection by this bacterium and not by stress or spicy food as had been assumed before...To demonstrate that *H. pylori* caused gastritis and was not merely a bystander, Marshall drank a beaker of *H. pylori* culture. He became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later. An endoscopy ten days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of *H. pylori*. These results suggested that *H. pylori* was the causative agent of gastritis. Marshall and Warren went on to demonstrate that antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis.

Both Warren and Marshall were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005 ""for their discovery of the bacterium *Helicobacter pylori* and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.""","1288574453"

"climbing","t5_2qk72","I used to take Ibuprofen at the first sign of pain, and then megadose for at least a week after... this of course just led to chronic tendonitis that was even harder to get over.  Now I prefer to skip the Vit-I altogether and just use the pain as a realistic gauge of how injured I am so I don't overdo it.

As for the pain you're having, it sounds like it might be a tricep imbalance.  I had pain in my lower bicep and it didn't start getting better until I gave it a rest and started working my triceps religiously.  The elbow thing is a bit trickier, but try to find the types of holds that are causing the pain (for me it was pinches), then after a good rest start back into climbing VERY slowly.  V0/1 is probably still too much.  Maybe try jump on some really easy top roping and just do laps until the slightest sign of pain, and then back off (or before the pain would be even better).  After a week with no pain step it up just a letter grade or two.  I would seriously start out at like 9/10a if you're an 11-12 climber... anything harder requires actually strength to do and thats probably not a good idea.

Basically, treat yourself like you have a beginners strength and work up from there.  Any stress on the muscles can easily lead to re-injury if the muscle is brought back up slowly.  That worked for me, but YMMV as always.","1288574477"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","What I find myself thinking after reading all of this (aside from the usual) is ""wow this guy sure repeats he loves her"". and then I ask myself: **WHY**

Why do you love her? From your tale it doesn't seem like you've ever had a genuinely loving moment with her. I get how pathological sadist/masochistic relationships work, but they ALWAYS start out with a ""normal"" relationship in which they loved each other, and then it goes downhill. But this is not your case. So I ask again: why do you love her?

You've stated that you not only don't want to marry her, but that the idea actually frightens you. So why are you still with her? You won't fix her (let me repeat this again **YOU WON'T FIX HER**), so really your reasons are just self-delusion. And all the while you're just wasting time that could be better spent firstly in therapy (you do need it, specially when you say that not a single woman in your life has ever told you she loved you; you need to look into why you pick such women), and secondly by being with someone who you'll be able to love for REAL reasons, the least of which isn't that she'd also **love you back**. 

Destructive relationships can teach us things, and most people will go through a destructive phase; but the time to do this is in your late teens and AT MOST in your very early 20's. I'm guessing you're mid 20's, so it's just **about time** that you grew up and made some decisions for yourself, instead of just wishing your abusive and patently mentally ill (yes, she is mentally ill, and I know mental illnesses) girlfriend would make good on her threat and erase you from her life (and hope that that doesn't also mean she'll erase you from *everyone's* lives).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Pandorum, had a fucking retarded ending. Actually the entire movie was just bad, but that ending just didn't make sense on so many levels. Let's take a simple quiz.

-Ok, so if you were going to send a space ship out on some 200 year mission to a nearby planet, your options are:

A) Once the ship approaches the planet, it will orbit around the planet and then send passengers down in smaller landing crafts.

B) Just take this massive miles long craft at some unknown velocity (but presumably one that could vaporize the ship if it where colide with any semi-solid bodies) and crash the thing into the ocean.

B is the correct answer.




- If you were to crash it into the ocean, what place would you want to do it?

A) Some place fairly deep, because this a fairly sizable ship. Crashing into an ocean is dangerous enough, there is no need to slam into earth at extremely high velocities.

B) Off a shallow coast sounds about right.

B is the correct answer.



-Which of these situations would eject the hyper sleep pods off the ship?

A) Pressure breach in a relatively small cabin.

B) Crashing into an ocean.

A is the correct answer.

 

-Presumible these pods where meant to launched in space, because a crash landing doesn't work. What would you want these pods to do in space?

A) Almost immediately after launching, just open randomly.

B) This makes no sense, because if something where launched into the void of space the odds of it getting some place that can harbor humans, is as close to 0% one can get.

A is the correct answer.




-If humans had to live off of other humans, how many people would it take to support a population of say 2 thousand? How many people would it take to support this population for 800 years? How many years would the people live if they consumed nothing more than 60,000 people in hyper sleep?

A) The average human body weighs 160 lbs. On average there are 3500 calories in one pound of human fat, and other tissue is on average 600 cals. The average body on average has 40,000 cals, or enough to feed 20 people for one day. For the entire population of 2000 to sustain itself, it must consume more that 100 people a day, or 36,500 people a year. The entire population will ultimately consume and starve itself after 2 years(this is including consuming itself.)

B) After 800 years there is about 1000 people left in hypersleep. This means that on average 750 people were eaten every year or about 2 people per day can sustain a population over 2 thousand individuals. 

B is the correct answer.

I could go on and on about this movie, but it was all really bad.

The biggest difference I feel is that most redditors expect other redditors to be good, which isn't always the case. Most redditors play for fun, and if everyone makes little mistakes it can add up very quickly. They expect the rest of the team to be able to carry for them, if/when they themselves happen to make a mistake.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My theory on this:

-Everyone starts out more or less the same

-Many people (NOT ALL) care about looks first. This could either be their decision, or pressure from their friends going ""omg that person is so hot blah blah blah"". Then the girl goes for the hot guy (or vice versa) for personal pride and status within his/her friends group. 

-The hot guys/girls can then do whatever they want, including being assholes, and they will continue getting partners, but they may not be able to sustain long relationships.

-Some hot guys/girls don't fall into the assholery/bitchyness, and they're taken real quickly... and the partner (who has a hot, nice partner) will never give him/her up. 

-This leaves the not hot people single. They actually have to be nice in order to find someone who will be interested in them. 


IMO, better to have a nice, ugly guy than a hot, stupid asshole guy. I could be biased because I'm one of those ugly guys (although not single), but looks only last so long. When all is said and done, we're all old and wrinkly with grey hair anyway.

I was a big UFO nut when I was kid. It actually went all the way through the early seasons of the X-Files. I actually started kind of delving into that world around then, but lost interest very quickly.

It became clear to me, even as a benighted theist at the time, that many of these people were mentally ill. Paranoid schizophrenics, mostly.

The rest of them were trolls, just playing with the poor schizos.

And there was never any evidence.

That's not actually true. I've been to the UFO museum in Hakui, Japan (which is actually a very good space museum--they have a real, used Soviet re-entry capsule, and a full-scale, NASA-produced mockup of the US version--the Soviets were kicking our butts. Their pod was way nicer.), and seen a piece of the Roswell wreckage.

They always describe it as a strange flexible metal with strange symbols or writing on it.

I would describe it as mylar with a purple floral pattern. Because that's what it is. It has flowers silkscreened onto it.

We have never been visited by aliens (as we imagine them anyway), and we never will be. Serious space travel is, for all practical purposes, impossible for animals with short lifespans. Yes, I used the ""i"" word. It is simply a modern mythology.","1288574730"

I mean it's completely irrational threat and fear that motivates people to hate these groups and what Bill is saying is similar to this.

He's suggesting that Muslims are a threat to America and that they're taking over the western world, even thought this isn't happening. I mean you might be able to get away with this in Europe (though I totally disagree) but there's no way that this is true in America. My point isn't the way that America deals with threats that's the issue, it's that it sees these minority groups as threats.

Funnily enough it loops back to the political machine as they can use any slip ups from members of these groups as a part of their propaganda machine. It's been seen so many times in American political history and it's happening again. I thought Bill was intelligent enough to see through this kind of scaremongering, but clearly it works.","1288574733"

Also, you can grab a cheap refrigerator thermometer from the hardware store for this particular project. No need to buy a digital, fungus is rather tenacious during periods of colonization and that's all you are really after. 

Buy: two 17gallon tubs, 100w or better aquarium heater, and an aquarium pump

 fill one tub about 5 inches from the bottom with water and place a small aquarium pump and an aquarium heater on the bottom. 

Nest the extra tub inside the first one such that the water is pushed as high up the sides of the tub as possible. 

Secure with zip ties or duct tape. 

place your cultures inside with a thermometer and wait. 

This system keeps the temperature inside the container constant and with out effecting the humidity inside the chamber.
 
 I don't know the best temperature for Rhizopus oligosporus, but I would hazard a guess in the eighties(tempeh is indonesian). Set the aquarium heater a bit higher than your desired temperature, this will vary depending on the wattage of your heater(mine was the highest I could find, you need the higher wattage because indonesian fungus is most comfortable at about 20 degrees over room temperature which means the water must be around 30 degrees over room) 

I have had many successful projects and I have come to rely on this double boiler incubator as a means to avoid difficulties while my samples are colonizing. I think this was my largest expense and it was altogether $70.

I don't exactly know what kind of reason or specificity you expect from me. Do I have PROOF that governments aren't always 100% corrupt? no. Nor do you have proof that they are. You didn't display any reason or specificity (aside from a quote from bin Laden, which I still don't understand why you think is credible) in your post, other than assumptions you yourself have come to, so I responded in kind. 

This post of yours is a bit better in that regard, but I still think (again, I THINK) you're a bit off. For instance:

Of course that is the case for many governments. I cannot refute that. But it is also not the case for many governments

Secondly, if you have also fought in wars (well, I guess it could depend on which wars), I cannot understand how you believe that the idea of global terrorism is merely a fantasy. Sure, interested parties absolutely trump up the threat of such dangers for their own interests, but it is absolutely the case that such global terrorism does indeed exist to some degree of concern. I mean, I hate to sound like Rudy here, but were you asleep on 9/11? Did you not have a TV or internet access when the Mumbai hotel killings occurred? How about the London and Madrid train bombings?

**Theist**: And why do you believe that

**You**: Because the scientific community are experts on their given topics, and their general consensus is the most accurate understanding we can achieve

**Theist**: Right, but what about the philosophical and theological community, does that not also mean they are the most qualified to debate the existence of god, and if their general consensus is that god exists, should you not conclude the same?

It's hard to explain but instead of those away, idle, active gems which are only 3 colors, there was a similar-sized icon which described just about everything you'd want to know about that particular person - online, active, away, idleness, idle time, whether they've IMed you since you last IMed them, whether they have an unchecked IM, and I think when they were typing or whether they had entered text.  It was incredible but apparently it was sort of hackish and not very streamlined so they took it out.  Which is unfortunate because it's the best UI element I've ever seen.

The mute thing is pretty important to me, but I understand that some other people don't care about it, I just don't see why a useful option which was easy to access before would be hidden away or eliminated entirely.  And I use it the same way, tabs open for weeks at a time, and I think many people do, so the log thing makes no sense to me.  At least they could log the date next to the time it was sent or something.

And I understand the note about the tone but I am honestly curious what UI elements got changed or broken, because it really does seem like every time I upgrade they do something I don't like.

You (OP) didn't mention too much about your training but it sounds like you drink a lot during runs and eat gels, etc. Is this right?

Hydration is obviously very important and most don't do it properly but you should try to limit yourself. Most of maraton training is teaching your body to be more economical and part of this is burning glucose (energy - pretty much sugar) more efficiently. Long runs are one way of doing this but if you are constantly drinking and eating gels you never get the full benefit.","1288574817"

'Joy Ride' was fun, as was 'Running Scared' and the first 'Fast and the Furious'.

To continue the Keanu comparison, 'The Fast and The Furious' has EXACTLY the same plot as 'Point Break'.  Both movies are about young pretty boy cops (Keanu was FBI) going undercover into subcultures (surfers/street racers) in order to locate and bust gangs of dangerous criminals (bank robbers/hijackers).  Both movies have a romance between the cop and a female close to the gang and in both the hero develops a friendship with the charismatic gang leader (who the hero ultimately allows to escape).  It's positively eerie...

Two other movies that have the exact same plots - ""The Road Warrior"" and ""Waterworld"".

If there is no way to make it seem natural then you might have to tell the witness some background info and ask them to be there for support because you worry for how the girl is going to handle it. Option 3)You don't think either of those scenarios are possible, weigh how important it is for you to leave her and being the villan against that.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I very much agree, although I can picture some interesting scenarios where the protagonists seemingly enormous armament lends no security against supernatural threats. 

There is a great scenario in Troika's Vampire: Bloodlines game. At about three quarters into the game your character is undeniably a badass. You're pulling off matrix-like gun fights, making whole rooms of enemies puke blood and writhe in pain, or turning into a huge beast and just tearing through swathes of vampires like a thresher through wheat. Then you encounter a werewolf. Bullets do nothing, you stand toe to toe and it will tear you in half. You are reduced to fleeing like a little girl, pissing your pants, all the while the werewolf is literally tearing down the walls to get to you. It's fucking terrifying, and the best example of a classic monster done right. In almost any other game a werewolf would probably be an interesting threat at first, but eventually turn into just another mob enemy.

Next you'll be telling me there really weren't ""three wise men"" in the bible, that the number was never specified. I know. 11 churches in 8 years as a kid, I was like a ping-pong ball my dad battered around until he found some dogma that fit well enough that he never had to change. 

Anyway, to get back to your point, which I admit is your first damn good argument you've had so far. 

I'm not sure I have a good answer. Really, the only justification that has ever made sense to me is that we (as a country) are protecting ourselves from an outside force.

I can justify in my own mind the torture of terrorists because it saves American (Or UK-ian) lives. I can justify the war against Afghanistan as retaliation for 9/11. It gets much, much harder to justify these things if there wasn't an enemy.

The problem is that the ""enemy"" actually exists. I have read enough about China to know the seriously 3-rd world, totalitarian, fascist, brutal nature of the People's Republic of China. If we let them, they **will** burn us to the ground like so many more dissenters left to rot in a field with a bullet in the spine. 

I think the problem (getting off topic here) is that people in Western countries literally believe what we were taught growing up: that people have certain inalienable rights, that all were created equal. We believe it **so much** that we get stuck in our own worlds: we drive minivans and take the kids to soccer and work at our jobs and somehow, somehow, never wake up to the fact that we live in a paradise compared to a very large portion of the world. 

I met one woman who traveled to India and was so god-damn horribly shocked at the conditions some of the population lives in (tent-cities, shit and dead bodies everywhere even in the rivers, disease and famine) that she set up a golf-tournament-charity to benefit the Red Cross. Serioulsy. lol. As if she was actually doing something to help.

My point is that we are so separated from the truth that when I say ""the enemy is real"" I won't blame you if you think I'm bullshitting. But in my mind, the enemy is the government like the PRC that shits on and kills it populace as easily as we make an order at McDonalds. 

So, to finally come back to your point: Religion isn't the ONLY cause of genocide and atrocity and death and harm, but it is a big one. In the middle east, it is a shield and cause and justification and tool (all in one) for harm. In the PRC, the government has no shield other than indoctrinated patriotism. 

But, you gotta see, it is one hundred times harder to stop the harm in a country where every male citizen literally believes to his fucking bones that man is greater than woman, that women cannot learn/vote/have rights than it is to topple a government (Like the PRC or like Nazi germany) that doesn't have religion to prop it up.

Religion, it aint doing anyone no good, man. 

But I'm not an Anarchist. If I have to pick between my country and fucking Saudi Arabia or Iran or the fucking People's Republic of China, I'm choosing the US of A. But I'm not trying to justify the horrible shit that goes on in the PRC simple because they do not have a state-run religion anymore than I'm trying to justify every-day date-rape simple because the fraternity brother who did it doesn't believe in god.

I just can see certain times when, say, torture makes sense if it stops another subway (metro?) bombing. It's funny though, it makes sense because we have (are protecting?) these silly little things like ""freedom of speech"" and the right for women to vote and the separation of church and state. That is a *real* justification (that has limits). Religion (""god said so!"") is never, ever, ever, **EVER** a real justification.

But yeah, I'm totally patriotic, but with a limit.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;As a Christian what do you believe? There is a God and he wants you to behave a certain way? God is the objective ethical system and the Bible is his instruction.

As a Christian I believe that there is a God, but the exact nature of that God is a mystery.  The Bible is a revelation and shared library of various religious experiences that people have had (but not the totality of) through out the history of Judaism and Christianity.  The Bible is interpretation of religious experiences, and then being of the Christian tradition we re-interpret those interpretations and experiences. 

&gt;Maybe Jesus' resurrection is metaphorical also? Maybe God and the Christ were just metaphors? Either they're real or they're not. Either the miracles happened or you're reading a fantasy novel.

yeah, but what's important is the meaning we interpret from the Christ narrative and mythology, not that they really happened or not.  Whether or not anything in the Biblical narrative doesn't matter because it cannot be known.  Further, there are many religious narratives and mythologies throughout history, and they're all authentic expressions of religious experiences, but I don't follow them because they are not my tradition.  Though this is not to say that they are wrong, but rather that they are just not mine.

"sydney","t5_2qkob","Depends on your age and tastes, really.

If you are up for spending a bit of money, are staying in the CBD and don't want to travel far, there are a lot of cool but more expensive bars and restaurants around Circular Quay, Darling Harbour and the Rocks.

 If you want a cheaper /alternative time of it, you might want to head to inner city venues such as Glebe or Newtown, though these aren't super cheap. If you want super cheap, any RSL will do the trick. In the worst segue imagineable (i.e. RSLs to Sydney's gay scene) , there is also Oxford St. that has a pretty thriving gay scene and more than a few night clubs, if you are up for that. 

If you are looking to get a little loose, Kings Cross is the red light district about 15 mins from the CBD. Darlinghurst is also close to Kings Cross and a little cooler without sleaze and with less drugs. 

If you let me know what you are into, I can recommend a few actual venues in the areas mentioned above. Probably not so hot on Oxford St. venues though as this is not really my scene.  ","1288574900"

&gt;It's hard to explain what is happening right now... Different planes of reality exist in your head... Some call it dreamtime, or the dreaming, others call it an alternate consciousness.  It is as if you are living in multiple places at once.  Problems arise from this, because your REM cycle shifted.  You are interchanging reality and dream.  Seamlessly, you could move from reality to dream, dream to reality, or even dream to dream, without noticing.  This, in turn, raises another issue.  Dreams are a standard function of the human body to help one deal with the mass of information they have experienced in a day, the little pieces of info that you stored away, the mind will try to connect the dots.  But if you aren't really in your waking moments, and the frequency of your dreams are rising exponentially, then your brain is going to try to connect the dots on info that you collected from dreams.  A dream based on  dreams.  The human body will no longer continue to try to heal itself, and make sense of what is reality, but instead will be trying to make sense of the senseless, the dreams.  All information driven from an unrealistic reality, you connect those dots and one will only see sanity turned upside down. ","1288574960"

""Of course the best way to prove a landlord is in breach of the law is with receipts such as cancelled cheques for more than just the two months' rent down-payment...""

""There seems to be two options against those landlords who are doing these illegal charges:

For those who can afford it, talk the landlord down to as few months as possible (and file a complaint once you get in.)
...
And for those who, as most, cannot afford more than first and last month's rent deposits, you can either forget about getting a place in that building, or go with a witness and a hidden taperecorder and then immediately take that tape of the demand by the landlord for more than just the first and last months' rent deposit to the media in the hopes it will force the landlord to take you on as a tenant without the extra illegal deposit.

Also, no, protein won't make you gain much more muscle, it'll just help you feel fuller longer. Being a girl, you have only about 10% of the testosterone levels of the average guy, so gaining significant muscle mass will be much harder, especially in the absence of lots of calories.

You believe there is a law that says because someone is an American, even if he carries out attacks  on the US and hides in Yemen, that he is unreachable by the US. That, frankly, is naive and senseless. There is no such law. I say the Constitution or Declaration (which isn't law, btw) is not a suicide pact.

Unexpected emergencies can force you to leave your dog at home at a time when you do not have time to look for a family to trust with taking care of your pet. But because pets treat each others as outright enemies upon initial contact, almost anything can happen to your dog, especially if it is a Chihuahua. It is for this reason that dog boarding facilities have been created as helpful alternatives for families that may be going on holiday for long periods of time. Continue reading to learn more about how to find the best dog boarder facility.

The best dog boarder facilities are run by qualified veterinarians. There is nothing as unsettling as entrusting an individual who has no proof of experience with handling dogs. Dogs can develop unexpected illnesses during the time you are away with the probable result of them dying. A qualified vet will surely know how to treat a pet that falls ill while he has custody of it. If you work with an inexperienced dog lover you might have to pay for vet fees upon your return because such a person was unable to treat your dog.

Staff – all staff at the best dog boarder facility will have a sound knowledge of pet needs and animal health knowledge. Make sure that they are personally interested in your dog. For example, do they seem to care that this is your dog’s favorite blanket or that they like to drink water in-between meals etc? If the staff seem to switch off when you are telling them this information, then look elsewhere.

When it comes for temporary dog boarders it is very important to choose the broader which offers 24 hour check up inspection. You can find a great deal of these services in your city. You can choose the services which offer complete cleanness. The more the human interaction the services offer the better would be the sate of your dog. So always choose these services wisely to keep your dog happy, even if you are not with it.

"martialarts","t5_2qkt4","This ""thinking man"" stance doesn't seem to me to be as bad as you suggest.

*  Against multiple opponents it may be an effective strategy, because there will be more attackers than you can handle with traditional blocking techniques. For self defense situations it has the great advantage of defending against attacks that you don't see coming.
*  Getting ""beat down on"" isn't too bad if they are punching your elbows. They will be getting more hurt than you.
*  As far as vision goes, the arms are supposed to be held up in a way that allows you to still see your attacker.
*  If the elbows are kept in, then if the opponent moves in to clinch or wrestle, you will be in a good position with your arms on the inside.
*  body shots can be absorbed or blocked by a good fighter from that position.

I would have to practice the technique and use it in an applied training scenario in order to get a better sense of it, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. I practice a similar stance which I call ""caging"" (because you are making a cage around your face) but I use it as a transitional stance (as you move towards your attacker into grappling range).","1288575049"

Your ""solid"" Model T example is akin to saying computer chips definitively prove deflation just because the faster they get the cheaper they become.  That is absolutely *ludicrous*.  When things become cheaper due to productivity growth, that capital doesn't just suddenly disappear from the system.  That freed-up capital goes towards investments in new industries and new products which then costs *more* money and also serve to enrich our everyday lives.  Without new investment there wouldn't *be* any productivity growth and vice versa.  Where's the incentive to invest if my money is gaining value just sitting under my mattress?  This has nothing to do with indoctrination, this is a basic common sense fact that anybody with any real-world understanding knows to be true.  You clearly view yourself in waaaaay too high esteem, however, to engage in any kind of level-headed, rational debate so I'm not even going to bother trying.

The God I was raised with didn't hate the gays, he wasn't going to condemn me to the fires of hell for having sex.... Of course, I won't say that my moral compass is as it is *because of* religion, rather that the way I was raised, even though it was religious, didn't make me feel like anything was wrong that I don't still think is wrong now that I am an atheist.... In ways I consider myself lucky, and in other ways it made the transition to atheism more difficult for me, because I wasn't suddenly realising that this supposedly loving God was telling me to hate fags or suppress my sexual urges. I went through a long spout of Deism. I had a personal relationship with God at the time. I believed that he loved me and that as long as I was a good person that it was all gravy. The move from Deism to atheism was slower still. I do remember the first time I had a conversation with a friend and told them that I didn't believe in God any more and was having a bit of a cognitive dissonancey time with it, but that passed and logic prevailed.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","During last December on Winter Break, my friends and I ended up getting into a bunch of heated discussions about philosophy, society ethics, and the evolution of humans. We talked about how governments came to be, social contracts, and what it means for something to be 'right'. All kinds of fun philosophical stuff with no real answers.

I really enjoyed these discussions, but they made me quite depressed, existential, and empty inside. You may have heard the statement, ""Ignorance is Bliss."" Well after these discussions I truly realized the context behind this statement, as I had never felt this way before about life, the universe, and everything. My friend turned me on to a book written a long time ago called Nausea (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea_%28novel%29). I would recommend you at least read the description, it described what I was feeling and made me feel a bit better about it.

You're not alone in feeling this way. Life is overwhelming in the sense that there's so much to do, but you can use that freedom to do something great. There's a lot of bad in the world, and the way we have the world setup right now is not good by any stretch of the imagination.  You can have a fulfilling life without changing how nation states are setup in the world by helping out a family overseas or maybe in your own community. 

Consider this. You're attending grad school. That puts you in what, 1%-2% of top intelligence in the world? Be happy that you're up there when the majority of the world doesn't have a stable source of food. You've been granted a chance to do something significant for the world, be happy!","1288575077"

The rocks has some good pubs if you want a crawl (The Argyle is a fave). 

If you want to hang out with people who think they are better than you, the Ivy is your spot, or if you want to hang out with people who you are better than, head anywhere else on George St (Three monkeys and Jackson's are truly terrible)

If you are into an alternative kind of mood, definitely check out Newtown (maybe a midweek adventure), very cool. Good pubs and a good vibe.

If you like heavy music, check out Club Blink, it's always fun there.

- The scientific mindset is to *try to prove that you're wrong* (or get your friends to do it.) If it can be proven that you're wrong, back to the drawing board. ","1288575103"

JWs celebrate only one holiday, the Lord's Evening Meal. It's a commemoration of the last supper and they get it straight from the Biblical quotation of Christ telling his disciples to keep doing it in his remembrance. 

JWs also celebrate anniversaries, but that's about it. No birthdays, no Christmas, not even Father's Day. It's their belief that these holidays are either ""worldly"" or outright contrary to their interpretation of the Bible. ","1288575105"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I've seen people in the GOP *claim* to favour smaller government and less expenditure. I've almost never seen a government from the GOP that didn't actually create a larger expenditure *while cutting taxes* (usually by escalating conflicts into large wars, though the democrats do that too).

If you actually believe in smaller government, you should probably look elsewhere.

I think the first task of a responsible government for the US would be to reduce debt (initially by actually raising taxes), and by making sure that money that is spent is actually spent on programs that achieve tangible results. (Governments are actually there to make laws and to spend money; the task is to get them to do either effectively.) 

Governments here (where I live) from both left and right (though we no longer have a serious left either) have reduced debt when possible and spent more when conditions have called for it; their disagreements are mostly about extent and priorities. The problems really only come when you spend money that you don't have and then don't pay it back as soon as feasible. When you increase spending and reduce income (as GOP governments have repeatedly done), your economy in good times is overheated, which means a bunch of people get stinking rich - but ultimately the economy is utterly screwed because when you need to recover after the inevitable bubble and crash that this overheating causes, there's *nowhere to go*; it overheats hot economies and shrinks the economy *when it's weak*. 

(I'm fortunate in that the voting system here means that I can vote for the minor party that comes closest to representing me *without wasting my vote*, so my preferences are clearly reflected in my vote.)

Speaking as an outsider that has been to the US many times (and spent many months there, been to dozens of different places in the US, and watches US politics closely), the US doesn't *have* a left, and hasn't had at least since WW2 began - and even the one during the depression was pretty much a centrist government. 

Richard Nixon made a deliberate decision to cultivate the religious right and make it the solid base of the GOP. What you have now is the pretty much inevitable result of that decision. 

What the US has these days is a broad center right and a largely theocratic-militarist far right. The intellectual, true-economic-conservative base that the GOP once had has left; they're pretty much all ""independents"" now.

I don't have good advice for you, whether to stay in the party or leave it. Either way, good luck. The US needs a strong intelligent GOP.

I though truthfully, it was a fair cross section of america.  Of course you will see a bunch of white people.  Check your demographics for the country.  This rally didn't pander to any specific group that I could think of.  I know that tea partiers are the butt of most of our jokes, but every tea partier that I have met has been polarized to the extreme.  Finding the goofiest looking folks at the rally, or editing down your content to show the extreme left or better yet the uninformed left does not really prove a point.  I avoided microphones due to the knowing that I would probably not express my point well or intelligently, or be edited down to look like an ass.  I know that we have had videos on here of the tea party acting insane(which gets upvoted to the moon no doubt).  I think the overall difference was that most of the folks I saw their were: A. being satirical, B. being orderly and polite, C. (as a small minority) polarized and ignorant to the other side.

I know this is fairly incoherent and babble, but I felt that I should mention it.  

I think it took some work and editing to find people to seem like elitist at this rally.  Most that I spoke with were calm, polite and intelligent.  

When in a tea party majority, I tend to see a level of close-mindedness that is only rivaled by the worst racists.

I can only think of one two-loss champion in the modern era (LSU), though. So maybe a Big 12 or SEC champion doesn't have to be undefeated to make the title game, but more than one loss is generally the end of any team's chances at the big game.","1288575164"

But other things to think about for just a brake change, go get yourself some superblue brake fluid, kind of hard to find but helps reduce fade, and if you want to get farther afield in the brake system I would also toss on some stainless brake hoses too.  all of them will contribute to a firmer pedal and more positive brake response.

Congratulations on becoming a part on one of the biggest, oldest, most diverse and well-respected subcultures on the planet :)
All I can recommend to you right now is to read, read, and read some more. Metal archives and wikipedia are both great sources, and browsing wiki pages of different genres and then YouTubing them can help you get a sense of what a genre is like. Last.fm is a great resource too, I encourage you to join, especially if you're a resident of the U.S. in which case you can listen to tracks for free.

My personal favourite genres are Folk, Pagan and Viking Metal.

Some awesome bands to start with are:

Enisferum (yes, my name is a play on this band's name hehe)

Turisas

Menhir

Eluveitie

The following albums by Bathory: *Blood on Ice, Twilight of the Gods, Nordland I, Nordland II*

Finntroll

Wintersun

Skyforger

Metsatöll

You CAN kill the werewolf with weapons, but all you've found so far is a shitty pistol that you looted off a bum upon whom you had to feed.  If you're lucky, it won't blow your hand off when you try to use it.  You have four shots.  Let's say ten shots because the bum had an extended clip.

If you shoot it enough, it'll die.  But see, they haven't taken over the world because the military and police would mow them down.  They stick to the shadows.  Now one's in front of you, and he's pissed off.

If you're a good shot and land enough head shots, you can take it down.  If you suck at shooting, just try to escape, or find some silver bullets.  Use some kind of force multiplier to take it down.

So you run into one later, when you have say, an assault rifle.  Not as big of a challenge, but still certainly a threat.  One werewolf isn't going to keep you from your goal, but what about two?  You check your clips...","1288575276"

I guess you skipped to the summary without going back to check what I wrote before critiquing me.

Here's what I actually said:

&gt;A good argument begins with a point that is safe to assume is accepted by the person or people you are presenting to.

It's *context* dependent. All good arguments (notice, good is not the same thing as sound) begin with something that is accepted by all involved parties. If you begin with something in dispute, you can get absolutely nowhere in your discussion. Read any Platonic dialogue for examples of this.

Avatar, for example, wasn't that great of a movie in terms of content; it was too predictable, for one thing, and the fact that the 3-D technology was well utilized doesn't make it better, it just increases the 'wow' factor the first time you see it. 

If a good movie was released only in 3-D and was recommended to me by people with valued opinions and received a lot of critical acclaim, I might make an exception.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;and adults know every action has a consequence.

Thanx for giving me a good lol moment. Sry but that is just not the case. Sure some are. However most aren't. The tide is turning to where that is becoming less and less where it use to be more and more. As for being younger and more curious and it dissipates so no adults are curious? The error in that is that you are looking at kids in general now and adults now. 2 very distinctive groups. What you fail to put into perspective is the actual persons as a kid and them as an adult. They are still the same people. If they are curious as a kid they will be curious as adults. A lot of the times a little less but quite often a lot more or simply the same. The only thing age really does is give you more experiences to draw from to know what is right for you and what isn't. If you are dumb as a doornail you could be 40 and a kid who is smart could take the little experiences they know and build a better foundation on it and be more of an adult than that 40 year old. So you just can't use that as a reason because it has very little to do with reality. It can explain some but not all. Its painting groups with a very broad brush. Personally I think its older people trying to show or reason that they are better than younger people in some way simply because they are older. You see that dynamic right now not with just lets say a younger person vs an adult to elderly. Age does not equal wiser. I have known plenty of dumbass 60, 70, 80 year olds. 

And again and again I am not arguing for or against pedo's just saying that your argument that traits such as curiosity doesn't change a significant amount within the same person over a period of kid to adult. That is unless there is a serious mental trauma that stops and reverses emotional development. ","1288575324"

One needle has been in there for some time..(long enough I can't remember) the other pen maybe 7-8 days.  The 7-8 days one is once a day and that tip looked pretty good.. although there did seem to be unappetizing detritus on it.. The other needle is a 3-4 times a day jobbie and so god nows how many uses.. it does not look as bad as the one in the pic, but it is clearly a bit blunt  at the tip..might explain some of the bruises I get. I would say it looked more like the 2 uses pic.. It also had a droplet of insulin and a hair stuck on it as well.

"self","t5_2qh96","What's going to get you is utilities. I highly suggest reading the electric and water meter once a week and keeping a running tab in a spreadsheet. It helps you understand the power you are consuming. Each number is a Kilowatt hour and can be multiplied by the power companies KWH rate (.08 to .20 cents). You'll have no horrifying surprises at the end of the month. I was so broke-ass that I turned off the hot water heater except one hour to shower and do dishes.

Texas doesn't get too cold, but an electric blanket will cut down your heating bill immensely. Another trick is to put jugs of water in the fridge to help keep it cool for less money (that is unless you have a fridge full of food).

Food bills will also murder you. Get in the habit of making a big batch of something like pasta or chicken &amp; rice and then freezing little dinner portions. You can get those little Pyrex glass dishes that are sized just like a TV dinner. 

When you shop for food, you may find it better to shop with cash. I used to bring in a $20 bill and do the math as I put stuff in the cart. I kept a running total in my head. I knew I only had cash, so there was no way I would run up a check/credit card.

Eventually you'll go the Raman noodle route, but do this: Do the noodles up in a fry pan (boil them in 2 cups water). Now drop in 1/2 cup frozen mixed vegetables and a whipped egg. Just let the egg cook on top for a minute or two in the boiling water. It's super cheap and fairly nutritious  that way. You can also do this with rice.

With cable internet you can sometimes bargin by signing a 2 year contract. I got our bill down $20 doing that. Do everything on the net. Get a Skype number and consider getting rid of the cell phone. Watch TV on Hulu, etc. 

Finally, when a bill comes in. Pay that sucker. Don't put it off. Get that thing out of your way the minute you get funds. YOUR MIND WILL FUCK WITH YOU. Don't let it. Pay the bills first and then party later. 

Finally, don't get into the credit card trap. At that age, you will never pay them back. You will struggle for some time before credit cards can be a luxury.","1288575348"

"business","t5_2qgzg","The example you give highlight exactly why the system needs to change. If you took all 7,100 of those ""qualified"" applicants and had them do the job, their performance would definitely not be the same. The hiring criteria fail at their purpose.

For an extreme but illustrative example, imagine if a young Warren Buffet applied there under a different identity. Would the hiring process identify him based solely on his abilities? For most companies (in most industries, too), the answer is no. He would just be one of many ""qualified"" applicants. If someone else got hired instead of him based on networking, the company would suffer a monumental loss and *they wouldn't even know it*.

The company that can accurately and reliably narrow down the applicant pool to fewer, better applicants will have a competitive advantage. Networking is a cheap and quick method, but it's not a reliable or valid measure of job performance. Naturally, diminishing returns apply to how much you narrow the applicant pool, but the overall cost of doing so will only go down over time.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","Basically you're not arguing about sexuality, you're arguing nature vs. nurture in general. See the thing is you could argue about something like musical talent or athletic ability. Hard work? Circumstances? Innateness?

That's the inherent problem with arguing people are ""born with it"" or ""it's a choice"" or any variety of in between or both or all. It just comes down to someone's personal philosophy. I say as long as a person isn't justifying hatred with their views--or consciously aligning their views with hatred, they're perfectly entitled to them.

If sexuality weren't such a big deal, you'd be arguing about something like musical talent--that it's a slap in the face to all their hard work to say they were born with the talent. You might counter that it's a slap in the face to people who wish they had musical talent to pretend nobody is born with natural talents. And then they might counter that with A, and you counter with B, and they C etc. It's a great (and very old) argument. But it can also be very offensive, because arguments (from either side) can be and are used by bigots. Gay people are sensitive because of that in addition to thinking very deeply and personally about it on their own, in trying to understand their own experience, i.e. ""why am I different?""

Make a small incision at the base of the blister. Make sure you leave the roof of the blister attached so it can continue to protect the skin.

Use a gloved finger to gently push the fluid out.

Apply antibiotic ointment to a piece of gauze and cover the wound.

Cut a hole the size of the blister in a piece of moleskin.

Cover the blister with the moleskin so that the blister rests in the middle of the hole and the adhesive sticks to the skin around the blister.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","You left your wife because of how things were. Your current wife is now leaving you. How do you not see that maybe the problem is actually you and not them. As for ""rightly reciprocated love"" all I can say is that you're expecting a hell of a lot. We are all different and to be able to reciprocate correctly takes time, which you obviously didn't give the marriage as you only made it a few years. It can take awhile to figure out how one person needs to be loved and how you need to be loved. You cannot expect that in just a few short years that's completely ridiculous. Not only that but you're an active duty soldier and you had kids early! Where in the hell did you expect to find the time to figure all of this out? I appreciate what you do please don't get me wrong I'm not attacking your job. I'm simply saying it didn't contribute to this reciprocation you were looking for.

I don't believe in someone only having one true love. There are people who will work with you, there are some who you will work better with you than others. My aunt was married three times and in love with each man. She never divorced she just outlived them all, two got cancer and I think one had a heart attack. She was an amazing person and she loved them all faithfully and they all worked differently with her. If you're with someone, your first wife for example, and you get married than you figure it out. You don't just get up leave because all of a sudden some girl comes along who has a ""better offer."" You took very little time to even try to make it work. I'm sorry but that's not a decision I can simply respect and coming from someone who is married and knows how it works I'm pretty sure I have every right to say it. I don't love my husband because he ""reciprocates properly"" I love him because I chose him and because I decided to follow up my ""I do"" with an ""I Will"" and i choose to love him every day we are together. Love is an emotion that doesn't last forever a marriage is a commitment that should endure. Love is a choice and it's not easy. My parents have been married 22years and my husbands parents for 25. They didn't always reciprocate well and each of us saw them almost split. However, they didn't just walk out on each other because love wasn't being reciprocated properly or because the needs of the other person were too much. They stuck together because marriage is a commitment and they were committed to each other. Both of our sets of parents are extremely happy and in love to this day because they stuck it out through the hard times. You could have done that...","1288575436"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","""..she called me 28 times the night before to tell me not to cheat on her."" Wow... that is pretty intense.  Have you ever done something to break her trust?  Have past boyfriends cheated on her?  You need to delicately let her know that this type of compulsive behavior is not conducive to a healthy relationship.  Perhaps you could explain that you love her and would not cheat on her but such compulsive behaviors push you away. Besides, whether or not someone cheats is not determined by whether or not the person's SO repeatedly asks them not to cheat.  

Also, why is she suspicious of your activities if she is the one who slept with an ex? That is not okay...

Overall, it sounds like she has really really low self-esteem.  Does she have close friends and hobbies?  It sounds like you both could benefit from setting aside time every week for friends and hobbbies.  If you aren't sure if she is the one for you, she definitely needs to have a life outside your relationship.  You are not out of line in wanting to have time for friends and hobbies.  Just try to include her sometimes, so she doesn't feel excluded from your circle of friends.  

I also don't understand what you mean by ""whether I'm crazy or not for finding a girl that absolutely loves me.""  If you break it off with her, there is no way to avoid ""hurting her too much.""  If you love her, it is worth sticking around to see if you can work things out.  If she loves you, she will want you to be happy and will give you space for friends/hobbies.  Her clingy-ness and self-esteem issues won't change overnight, but if she can recognize that this is a problem and is willing to work on it, then I think you should give it some time.  Just be very clear in what you need for the relationship to work (trust, privacy, personal space, etc.)  Maybe she would be willing to see a therapist, since it can be hard to work on self-esteem/trust issues on your own.  I know suggesting someone see a therapist is a very touchy subject, but perhaps you could go about it by explaining that you need her to move past her trust issues and suffocating/compulsive behavior for this to work and then asking her how she thinks she can do that.

"melbourne","t5_2qkhb","I want to sell my car... 1992 Subaru Liberty GX Front Wheel Drive. It's in desperate need of some TLC, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it... it does need new front tires and it makes a loud clicking/crunching noise when making left turns.

When do you need it? I really should put it in to a mechanic to get an assessment. I did have it in for the clicking noise at one point and they quoted $600 to fix that, but I can't find the paperwork and I know absolutely nothing about cars so I've forgotten what the problem is.

Thing is, I'm *flat* broke, I don't have the cash to get a mechanic to look at it... If you can wait a few weeks, maybe a month, maybe we can talk? :S

EDIT: I really have no idea what it's worth at the moment. I bought it for $5000 about 3 years ago. My ex girlfriend managed to dint it and scratch it a fair bit and it's had a couple of problems. I think when I got it it was probably worth closer to $4000 but I'm kinda stupid. I'd say now I'd be thrilled if I ended up with $1000... I'd probably take $1k + anything I spend fixing it up...

When I started having doubts and acting on them, my mother became abusive. She threatened to put me on the street, told me my father wouldn't want me and told me I was a mistake. 

She raised me to believe that I was supposed to allow her to beat me because she was given authority by God because he made her my mother. She used fists, tools, books, even sprayed carpet cleaner in my eyes once when she said I mouthed off to her. 

Even to this day, when someone is throwing a punch at me, my instinct is not to move because if I did that with her, it'd mean I got hit more. 

I threatened to tell the police once. She pulled a knife on me and held it to my stomach and threatened to gut me right there. 

I did tell a social worker once. Damn idiot called her and asked her if it was true. She made me tell him I lied or she'd put me out of the house. 

I never told anyone what was going on. My mom is a doctor and we were well off. I figured this was the price I paid for being well-off and I lived with it. 

Eventually, she hit me in church one day when I was a 18 or 19 in front of one of the elders of the congregation. He told her, and the elders agreed, that she shouldn't be doing it. She never stopped though, and they took no action to protect me. Once that happened, I knew I could never keep on going with it. ","1288575492"

He says that he thinks that everything needs to have a creator, and asked what created the Big Bang (or if something came before the Big Bang, what created that?). He admits that the flaw in his theory is that if God made that then who made God (I told him that the general theist 'go to' on that is that God exists outside of space and time and that normal rules don't apply to him).

Could you suggest how I answer him? I'd really appreciate it. I can *see* the rational thought setting off light bulbs about his faith in his head (he's at 'deism' now, I think), just a few more light bulbs and I could rid him of his faith forever (I hope).","1288575526"

If you are not experienced in IT and you don't have anyone there who is, then this will cost you quite a bit in frustration, time and future support costs.  Every time something goes wrong or it goes down you will be paying.  

From your description it doesn't seem that you environment is maintained so the support will probably cost even more.

&gt;   Because they all were plagiarized from ancient Egyptian religion and Egyptian God of Sun, Amon.

You answered:

&gt;To the contrare, the Semitic languages, derived from **Noah's** son, Shem. All are common to this area.

I asked you about Noah and if he was a real person.

You didn't say anything for several later posts. I asked again:

&gt;    And finally, Noah's story. Seems like you have something to hide about it. Do you believe it or not?

You answered:

&gt;Nothing to hide about it, never cited Noah or his son, but cool. Now why don't you stick to the topic and refute science once again. I love how you jump from topic to topic.

I didn't get an answer, only ""Shut up, you are stupid"" so I asked again. Your answer:

&gt;Yet again, I reiterate that I never brought up the flood, we were discussing your lack of knowledge on the root of some major religous beliefs, or do you forget that?

That was not an answer. I asked you once again:

&gt;Third thing, was Noah and his Ark a real thing or not? Only two possible answers, Yes and No. Choose one.

You said:

&gt;Scroll wheel, use it, and you would have seen my answer, but seeing as you cannot read, no wonder you have not seen it.

Am I missing something?

I'm asking if Noah was a real person. If yes, was the Ark and the Flood real? If no, why are you using his name to support you?



About the research. Yes that's exactly what I'm saying. I'm saying that you can't trust this research because it's just too small. 50 people is not much even for an average university, let alone one of the biggest. I'm in university right now (yes, I am) and we do researches and surveys. And each time we question hundreds of people. And even then we can't say that these results are definitely undoubtedly true because we haven't surveyed every single student. Therefore you can not say that *"" religious conviction provides a framework for understanding and acting within one’s environment, thereby acting as a buffer against anxiety and minimizing the experience of error.""* This statement is true in that group of 50 people but it does not apply for a whole wide world. I wouldn't be surprised if results would be completely different if they did the survey with 50% atheists from good background vs. 50% muslims and other religious people from flood-affected areas in Pakistan.","1288575536"

"science","t5_mouw","I'm not lumping religious people and religion together as one indivisible entity.

Religious people =/= religion.

Plenty of religious people do things that aren't religious - Christians sometimes kill and often have gay sex. Just because a religious person did something scientific doesn't mean that their religion was the cause of it. However, the religious proletariat tend to do their best to block certain scientific developments that go against their beliefs ... again stem cell research is the example I keep using because it's prominent, contemporary, and significant.

There are also plenty of people who claim to be religious to the world, but in their hearts are not. Therefore you can't look to external labels to judge what someone truly believes in their heart, particularly if they're in a society (historical Christian, and both historical and contemporary Islamic societies) where not publicly believing is grounds for being killed.

There are plenty of religious people that have done good things, but that doesn't mean religion isn't diametrically opposed to free thinking, critical thinking, and many scientific developments. Science is bad for religion and tends to eventually undermine religious belief.

You should check out /r/programming and see how long it takes you to find a joke about a developer being approached by some budding software magnate who has a great idea for an app, no technical skills, and no money. But hey, it's your lucky day, if you do all of this person's work for them, they'll share the profits with you!

So, in short: Pay a professional to make it for you. Offering a profit sharing deal will only get you the kind of idiot that would do free work for a broke businessman in exchange for a share of future profits. Rentacoder.com is full of developers, and it even has an option where you can make people sign and upload a confidentiality agreement before they can see the job they're bidding on.

Incidentally, if you have enough money to properly patent an idea, you have more than enough money to hire a developer to make the thing for you.

* Sadly, aid budgets across the world have steadily been declining since the 90s (and most of what remains has been converted from aid to loans) and nowadays most aid is done for the benefit of the donors and not the receiving populations. One of the biggest problem is that aid efficiency is often measured on a quantitative basis rather than a qualitative basis. Donors want MORE bang for their buck and they equate that with MORE schools and more wells rather than BETTER schools and wells. In some instances (food for newborns) this can cost lives (malnourished newborns whom are feed crappy food void of nutriments).

* Furthermore lots of private donors have agendas and seek to promote certain types of initiatives. For example the biggest private donor in the world, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (fact no 3 I'd guess for most people) was at first really big on technological initiatives (this has somewhat changed). However installing computer labs in third world cities that don't have a good electrical grid, internet infrastructure or local and continued tech support proved to be quite infective and a lot of money and time was wasted on similar projects. Today the BMGF is much more broad in it's goals and learned that, as with life, everything is connected : you cannot solve development problems one problem at a time.

* Finally, simply trowing money at problems does not work in most cases. 
The same BMGF as an other example offered double salary to the medical staff of a country if they worked on preventative AIDS vaccination. The end result was that the entire medical infrastructure of the country collapsed within a couple of years as doctors and nurses jumped on the BMGF project initially, abandoning where they were working on and, later, having now experience with a prestigious western NGO left the country to work in Europe and America. Neighboring countries suffered a similar shortage and other infections and sicknesses grew more rampant because of inadequate vaccination. Today that country is trying to rebuilt it's medical infrastructure to a level equal to what it once was 10 years ago....

I think a major problem with the whole idea of 'reclaiming' a word is  that people say only a specific group of people who were targeted by it can say it.

Your point was that I was incorrect, but you didn't say how or why and you explicitly said you weren't willing to provide any information. You're arguing in bad faith. 

&gt;Secondly, if you have also fought in wars (well, I guess it could depend on which wars), I cannot understand how you believe that the idea of global terrorism is merely a fantasy.

As I pointed out above, [There is a connection between terrorism and military occupation](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/18/it_s_the_occupation_stupid?page=full). It's the cause. Americans were not being attacked in Iraq by suicide bombers until Americans invaded and occupied Iraq. There have been more attacks against America since it expanded its reach into the Middle East than anytime before it. Don't sit there and say ""herp derp correlation doesn't mean causation"" because it's absolutely bullshit. What plausible explanation can there be for 9/11 other than the US pissed off a bunch of Muslims for occupying their land, supporting brutal regimes and killing [hundreds of thousands of Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_sanctions)? 

&gt;Or am I to believe that the governments deliberately set all these up and that crazy, violent people with access to weapons do not exist?

WHY did they do these things? You're not even asking the most fundamental question in this matter! This is why the threat of terrorism is a fantasy! It's imagined by the government to justify its expansion, which then causes the actual deaths as a violent reaction to its policies.

Al qaeda is literally [just 100 people](http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/president-obamas-secret-100-al-qaeda-now-afghanistan/story?id=9227861) in Afghanistan and a few hundred more people scattered elsewhere.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I planned on stopping at 6g, so good luck.  The best advice I can give is to take your time.  I've seen too many people try to rush, and even if you don't tear the fistula, stretching too fast can cause they cat butt look when you remove the jewelry.  Also, consider any stretch over 8g permanent, and don't expect it to ever close up on its own!  Everyone is different, and someone's lobes may close up completely from 1/2"", yours may not close up from 4g.  You'll never know until you see how your body recovers from it, and the only way to find out is to cross that bridge.

I'm joining the Air Force, and any piercing that is large enough to see light from the other side is too large.

I worked in restaurant kitchens, so I was hidden away from public eye.  I was happy with it, and I'm pretty smart with my money, and never had to worry too much about keeping bills paid.  I had a pretty decent list of references, and a resume full of high end restaurants, so finding jobs wasn't too hard.  As far as other areas and careers, I couldn't tell you.  I'm sure it depends on how common the style is in the area, and what career you're looking for.

I let them shrink on their own, and there's different ways of helping that along.  I used anti-ageing cream and (believe it or not, it really helps) Preparation H.  They went from 1/2"" to about 4g in a month and a half.  I considered surgery from the start, because I knew they wouldn't close up enough on their own.

I tore the right one once between 4g and 2g.  It wasn't too major, but it was enough to make me slow down on the rest of the stretching.

The cat butt look comes from stretching too quickly.  Think of the skin like a rubber band.  If you stretch it enough, it won't snap back.  The cat butt comes from the skin snapping back to a smaller size, and the fistula bunching up.  If you stretch slowly, and let the skin get used to being a larger size, it won't snap back and get the cat butt.  Did I get it?  No.","1288575618"

I used to think the same way, but money, and how you deal with it, says a lot about you. If you have a partner who doesn't care about a budget then it says he/she is careless about the future.  A partner who might sacrifice and go with say, nursing, an industry in need of people, is a keeper. Money and finances are extremely important, we trick ourselves about this and treat it lightly, but it's more important than we think.

We have way too many spoiled girls, spoiled by their fathers, who want to have fun while making a living in an industry that isn't hiring. As long as they think they're doing something, it's cool. Besides, they've always had men who paid for them so it's not their money anyway. I could be wrong about your case, but many women have no respect for finances.","1288575628"

"BSD","t5_2qh3d","I find FreeBSD to be a functional desktop OS, but less-than-ideal laptop/mobile OS.  Linux currently has better support for wireless networking GUI tools (specifically NetworkManager) and power management, both of which are pretty crucial if you're running it on a laptop.  But on a desktop the difference is not very great.  As other poster noted, if you want to run KDE, PC-BSD is a good option.  If you want to run Gnome, that shouldn't be a problem either (pkg_add -r xorg; pkg_add -r gnome2, or whatever).  I haven't had any problems with hardware support, but you can certainly check the Hardware Compatibility List to verify support for your specific hardware.  See:  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/faq/hardware.html

Also, a question for you:  How are you liking Fedora, specifically stability-wise?  I've tried it a few times and liked it, except in my experience it is one of the most unstable OSes I've ever used, and I wonder if my experience is unusual.  I'm aware that it is basically the testing branch of RedHat so some amount of instability should be expected, but it was too much for me.","1288575629"

Of course not.

&gt;How about you stop treating all Muslims as one and just let them do what they want.

Muslims who don't particularly care about that stricture can freely form their own communities and interpret and enforce Sharia as they see fit. As mentioned, Islam permits freedom of association. Further, there is no pope in Islam (at least Sunni Islam) so every interpretation is in a sense equally valid. 

&gt;They don't need your primitive laws to keep them in line with what  you  think is best for them and their families.

If a person wants to fuck somebody other than their wife/husband in public they should find another community that accommodates such primitive, uncivilized behavior. There is nothing in Islam that states that a person has to remain in a Muslim community for the rest of his/her life. As I said, Islam permits freedom of association. A Muslim can leave a Muslim community for another one, start a new one from scratch or just live on his/her own. 

&gt;The claim I was referring to was: God exists.

Then you're dishonestly shifting the goal posts. Why are you so dishonest? Is it because you're an atheist and therefore completely ethically bankrupt?

&gt;Theism: Belief in a god. Atheism: Non-Belief in a god.

*Sigh*...You're conflating agnosticism with atheism. Atheism is the (irrational) belief that God does not exist. Agnosticism is a lack of belief either way.

&gt;Clear things up?

No, your claim was false.

&gt;So what ""reality"" do you use to prove a god exists? Prove that there is something outside of the ""natural order"".

Look up the Big Bang Theory and the Argument from contingency. 

&gt;Any quotes from those personal writings?

Read this excellent essay - http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/mischedj/ca_hitler.html

&gt;You are correct. There is no dogma in atheism. It's simply a non-belief in a god. You can believe whatever else you want aside from that.

Actually there is one major dogma - the irrational article of faith that God does not exist.

The reality is, that none of the things he mentioned were significantly better, which makes me think they know exactly what the issues with the game are and just aren't willing to fix it.

Without seeing that interview I might be a little less annoyed, but as is I feel like they couldn't have reasonably believed they were shipping a game that significantly improved on Fable II, and instead were just hyping it in an effort to cash in on fans.

This line really stands out. You are in an emotionally abusive relationship with this girl, and you know it. You just have to cut her out of your life, by any means possible (though without any drama if you can help it). Hell reading your bit about her dressing slutty and getting fucked at a party made me cringe, and I've never even seen her! You can expect more of this torture in the near future if you continue on the current path. 

For your sanity, just stop initiating contact. If she messages you be cordial but keep it short and try and be busy. If she questions why you don't initiate contact than just say you are moving on and thus trying not to think about her (ergo, no contact). Set a specific date when you will do this, so you can measure your progress in objective terms. It's going to suck majorly at first, since you are addicted to the chemical highs of interaction with her, but this will pass with some time. The less you talk to her, the less you will think about how things are currently between you. As some point you will probably start feeling better and then relapse, but it will be a lot less intense than at first. Just beforewarned. 

I realize this sounds like ""easier said than done"" type advice, but it is the ONLY way you will be able to stop feeling like shit. The sooner you can start this process, the sooner you can move onto something better, which is when the real cure will come. I won't lie though, it's a long arduous process, and the more you drag it out, the more painful it will be.

"comics","t5_2qh0s","OK, after reading through the comments and looking at the comic a few times, I have a theory here.

It's obvious the brother has some kind of extra knowledge that he's keeping to himself.  How I see it, the brother knows that there's a doppelganger out there, and that it's impossible to kill.  It seems that the doppelganger can be injured, though.

Somehow, the brother knows all this info, and so comes up with a plan: injure the doppelganger, throw him in a hole that can't be exited, then either leave him in there or fill it up.  That way the doppelganger will be trapped forever.  This is why the hole smells like lilacs, since the brother has been digging these holes.

The problem is, out in the woods, the brothers get separated.  The hero finds the doppelganger, who is now disguising himself as the brother, and proceeds to do his thing.  He throws him down the pre-made hole, just like the plan does, but doesn't actually know it.  He goes back and tells everyone the ""beast is dead"", which is half true; the doppelganger is now trapped in the hole, unable to escape.

His brother, either lost or has been spending days looking for the doppelganger, returns home.  He congratulates the hero and everyone goes on with their lives, but the brother still thinks the doppelganger is out there.  He decides to dig a new hole, since for some reason the animals aren't disappearing, so he thinks that the doppelganger is now among the villagers, and he needs a hole nearby to dispose of the doppelganger once he finds him.

The hero is all confused, and goes down the hole to find out what's all going on.  The issue is, the doppelganger is down there, and now the hero will probably be killed and the doppelganger will take his place.

I believe this covers the plot, and makes a lot of sense too.  It also shows some mysterious motive behind the brother too.  Why is he hiding all these facts from the rest of the villagers?  How does he know these facts in the first place?  

Maybe the doppelganger is somehow his fault, or, at least, he feels like it's his fault.  Needless to say, digging that hole nearer the house instead of out in the woods show that he's starting to get nervous, and that he's expecting something soon that won't be good.  It's all so mysterious, and makes me really want more!

My argument against most tax is that the money they take is used for charity programs that I wasn't even asked if I wanted to participate in.  This is something that I think the government should have never gotten involved in.  Their bureaucracy has taken a tragic problem and made it not only tragic but pathetic.  That bad thing about charities is that they will always be taken advantage of and abused by a majority of their users.  The only way to stop this is to make one person responsible to make the decision and let them the judgment calls on individuals.  This the opposite of how a government bureaucracy works.  

If the we'd stop trying to save everyone, make people responsible for their actions and choices and stopped enabling people to do nothing, then that money could be put to better use.  

I personally favor some kind of flat tax or fair tax.  Either everyone pays a flat X% without deductions or no income based tax and just a federal sales tax of X%.  Lets do away with Income Tax as it is and the entire IRS.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","You will burn even more calories by adding weight lifting to your workouts. your body burns calories at a high rate for a while after doing exercise before returning to your normal resting state. Weight lifting makes that process last longer. once you begin working out with weights, your appetite should increase significantly. When your body has to rebuild the muscle tissue, it will need more food to do so. the weights will also trigger a higher natural production of testosterone, which will aid you in your desire to lose fat. You sound like you are already doing the most important things by starting, eating a clean and healthy diet, and reaching out for advice. I used to work in the fitness industry and gained around 50 pounds when I landed a gig in an office. I lost the weight about three years ago and I know how hard it is to get going. 

To keep motivated, I used to set myself goals to achieve and give myself rewards around attaining them. I was horrible at running being 50 lbs overweight and set a goal to run 3 miles in 30 minutes. I picked out a pair of running shoes I wouldn't normally spring for when I achieved the goal. Keeping the rewards fitness related helped as well. I had a really old ipod, and I wanted a small shuffle to use when I worked out. I was having a hard time motivating myself to do squats, so I set a goal to be able to do 4 sets of 15 with 225lbs on squat. It took a few weeks, but I was doing squats twice a week until I got there!

You have a guy who is completely overshadowed by his brother and as a result has a huge hole in his life.  He feels that the monster is his chance to fill it.  Only his brother comes along and ends up killing it.  His brother takes what he felt was his only chance to fill the hole in his life (represented literally as a hole).  He decides he can kill his brother and fill the hole with his life.  We see him do this and it in fact works for awhile.  However, you know people aren't just forgotten.  For awhile he was the talk of the town... but the memories of his brother came back and once again overshadowed him.  I feel that he isn't really there, but rather it is his memories once again digging holes into the guy's life.  I feel he is a memory because the coat is not torn.  He climbs down the whole to see if his brother is still in the hole.  He is, but is still alive.  By killing his brother he has created a new monster he can not escape from.

My interpretation.  Awesome comic.","1288575791"

No, people and feelings change. Shit happens. I don't admire the OP for leaving his family, my father left and it was fucking hard. But my parents got along better after they divorced then they did when they were married. Once things settled it was a lot easier and a big relief for all of us. That was over thirty years ago, and they're unusually close to this day. As friends and companions, just not married and sleeping together. 

As for the OP as a father, he is in their lives and supporting them. We all know enough guys who just fuck off permanently. My niece's father is one of those. My sister has had our help, my parents, and my husband and I, but zero help from the father. He plays no part, financially or otherwise.

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","I'm considering the evolution of the universe at large -- evolution being a gradual progression of change over time.  The evolution of life is one particular evolutionary process, but if one is to be intellectual honest, in my opinion, it has to be admitted that the distinctions between the evolution of the cosmos, of the solar system, of life on earth, etc, are simply a matter of definition and ultimately arbitrary.  The universe changes over time, and the evolution of life is simply a piece of that broader process.  In my post, I was purposing trying to take a very broad approach.  I felt that going into fine details would likely have bogged down a brief history of the universe since the big bang.  I was kinda banking on details coming out in the discussion.

Take genetic evolution, for example.  The DNA molecule represents an extremely ordered state.  Though its gradual divergence into more and more individual forms is indicative of the universal tendency towards increasing disorder, its initial proliferation represents a huge transition of less ordered molecular states into the highly ordered state of the molecule.  Even now, every time a DNA molecule replicates, it is expending energy to do so, which increases disorder, yet at the same time increasing material order by creating two highly ordered states where there had only been one beforehand.","1288575810"

1. It isn't that easy to pick up 1 yard when the defense basically knows what play is coming (run up the middle).

2. Even if they pick up the yard they need, it doesn't mean they are going to get a TD.  The defense gets stronger near the goal-line because they don't have to worry about deep passes.  There's a good chance the offense will end up settling for a FG anyway, and they might even end up turning the ball over.

Also, if the opposing team is playing great D, as the packers were, the O is even less likely to go for it on 4th.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The following link, interesting I think, references Xinhua report that 1/3 of rare earth is actually smuggled out of China. This is relevant to your point, because in fact the reason U.S., Australia, etc. are not mining their own rare earth goes back to China's being cheaper, because of political corruption, lack of regard for the degrading of China's environment and infrastructure (see World Bank for astounding annual costs of this) and of course the cheap Chinese labor (conditions of Chinese miners especially). http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2010/October/29101001.asp 

One common Han nationalist point of view seems summed up by this post on a blog (original Mandarin omitted): ""For your personal interest you can sell out the country? China is a developing country and there is still a long way to go. The key issue is of course economics. When rich countries said Chinese people like to take a small advantage, they are so disrespectful of Chinese people. They have been taking a big advantage of us! They don't want to lose their own raw material reserves, they don't want to destroy their country's environment. Therefore, they come to buy Chinese rare earths. Although rare earth is expensive and profitable, its value has largely exceeded the price. We are actually selling gold for the price of vegetables"" at an interesting post, I think, at http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/10/29/china-debate-on-rare-earths-export/","1288575835"

"Favors","t5_2re6a","1. Stop drinking soda.  Seriously no more carbonated drinks.  You will loose weight quickly just by drinking water from now on.

2. When you get hungry get crunchy.  Instead of chips eat carrots or celery.  Plain.  Celery is a negative calorie food, which means that it takes more energy to eat celery than actual calories.  

3. No more bread.  Eat a sandwich, but skip the bread.  

4. Shit allot.  Easiest way to do this is by having a cup or two coffees in the morning with a bran cereal (cracklin' oat bran).  The more you shit the better you will feel.

5. No more fast food. 

6. No more prepared food.

7. No more salt. Seriously.

8. Besides drinking lots of water - drink warm tea if you are cold.  You will clean out your system quickly.  This will help you curb your appetite. 

9. Meals plates should be 1/2 vegetable, 1/4 starch and 1/4 protein. Best protein is fish; The oils from the fish will help you process food.

10. No more sweets or chips.  Just until you loose the weight.  Look at your packages of chips . . . usually one serving is like 10 chips.  Eating a whole bag is like eating for 30 people.  Stay away until you loose the weight.

Just as an aside, someone once pointed out something funny about the ""torture porn"" moniker to me. As opposed to porn porn, which actually has people really fucking in it, there's no actual torture in torture porn, just simulated torture. It's an indulgence of a sick fantasy, but it stays in the realm of fantasy, whereas in porn all the stuff they show has actually happened.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Their first night in the dorm, Danny L. brought out a bottle of gin.  He shook it in a meaningful way.

It wasn't long before all of them were tipsy.  Danny.  Sam.  Joe and Bill.  

""Then I totally fucked her in the ass,"" Joe said.  The other three guys cried out.  ""Shit!""

""You gotta be ready to give it in the ass,"" Bill added.  ""Girls act like the don't want it but they do.""

Danny shook his head.  ""Not just give.  Take.  You haven't lived unless you've taken it in the ass.""  The three guys responded with shock.

""Dude,"" Sam said, ""That's so gay.""  

""Nothing to do with being gay,"" Dannsy said.  ""If you haven't come with something in your ass, you haven't lived.  You shoot your balls out.""

""You mean you've had something up there!?""  Joe said.

""Hell yes,"" Danny said.  ""I've done it myself.  With girls AND with guys.""  Everyone else gaped.  ""Guys!  Come on!  There's nothing like it.""  Danny was by no means inexperienced.  He knew what he was talking about.

He looked at Sam.  Sam had light brown, almost blonde.  ""Sam.  You're a virgin, aren't you?""  Sam blushed.  Everyone else hollared.

""Look,"" said Danny, ""If you don't fool around with SOMEONE, you'll carry this virgin thing around with you all throuh college.""  Sam looked at the floor.  The others were silent - no one else wanting to admit to the rising of their pricks.

""It might as well be us,"" said Danny.

""I'm not gay!"" said Sam.  Danny laughed.  ""You don't have to be gay for it to feel good!  Come on, dude.  It's college.  You can do ANYTHING you want.  Lets make your first night memorable.""  He passed the bottle to Sam.  

Sam looked at him and took a drink.  

Danny, Joe and Bill looked at Sam's naked chest by the light of the desk lamp.  Danny pulled  chair over.  It had a low wooden back.  Sams palms were sweating.  His cock was hard.  

""Ok,"" said Danny, ""it's gonna be good, I swear.  First, I need you to take off your pants.""

Sam didn't know why he did it.  He was horny.  He was young.  A million reason.  He stood there in his boxers.  Danny patted the wooden back of the chair.  ""Over"" he commanded.  Sam complied.  

""Ok, Joe,"" Danny said.  ""Pull the boxers down.""  Joe hesitated.  ""I know you want to.""  Danny added.  

Joe did want to.  He had never seen an asshole before - male or female.  And somethign about the idea drove him wild.  He reached for the bands of Sam's underwear and lowered them to the floor.

""Kick them to the side, Sam"" danny said.  Sam did so.  His hard penis jutted out.  His balls exposed.  and his ass in the air.  Danny moved around his backside.

""Alright,"" he said.  ""Lets get down to business.""  He went to hsi desk and retrieved a bottle of lube.  ""Let's get those legs apart,"" he said.

Danny reached down and moved Sam's legs apart, exposing his puckered asshole.   It looked tight and virgin.  The other guys looked on with fascination.  Sams cocked perked even more.  

Danny put a small amount of lube onto his midddle finger.  

""Joe,"" he said, ""You've been quiet lately.  It's time you helped out Sam as he loses his anal virginity.  Come over her.""

Joe complied.  ""Spread them,"" Danny said.

Joe didn't hesitate.  He used two hands to spread Sam's ass cheeks apart, making his anus clear.  Danny almost came at the sight.

""Keep him good and spread,"" Danny said.  ""Even if he resists.""

Danny began Sam's deflowring.

He glided his moistened finger over Sams asshole, grazing the opening.  Gently, he pressed the pad of his finger onto the flower.  The finger was easily inserted, though Sam gasped.  ""That's it,"" Danny said, ""Take it soooo good.""

He pushed his finger as far as he could.  Joe kept the cheeks spread and Bill looked on - his cock now out of his pants being stroked slowly.

When Danny felt Sam had become used to one finger, he moved on.  He forced two fingers into the waiting hole, all the while Sam breathing deeply, beginning to thrust with the fingers.  

""Time to up grade,"" Danny said.  He went to the bathroom and brought back a slender shampoo bottle.  

He brought out the lube again and rubbed some on the bottle.  ""This may feel to much at first,"" he said, ""But Bill is going to help you.""  

Danny moved Bill towards Sam's prick.  Bill kneeled by the chair his mouth ready to receive.  He too, was new at this, but his arousal swept over him.  He had to suck.  

Sam moaned and thrusted forward.  He was full of desire.  Man or woman, he had never felt such passion.  His ass was still thrust high as Danny stood behing him.  

""I want you to push out as I push in, Sammy"" Danny said.  And he position the lubricated bottle outside Sam's ass.

With three thrusts, he was in, rubbing in and out of the virgin ass as Sam was sucked by Bill, his cheeks  kept open by Bill.

The time had come for the real deal.  Sam choose to be fucked on the bed.  He was ready.

He knelt on his hands and knees.  Danny ordered Joe and Bill to lay on either side.  The two men pressed down on Sam's shoulders so he couldnt flail.

""This is it,"" siad Danny, ""But we're all here for you.  Joe and Bill, you know what to do.""

Joe and bill each grabbed an ass cheek and pulled, so Sam's anus was fully opened.  They kept him held down so he couldn't change his mind.  

Danny lubed Sams ass, then his own cock, setting it at the entrance.  ""Push out"" he ordered.

Danny drilled passed Sams resistance.  Sam cried out as his ass was filled with Danny's cock.  Danny pushed through, until his balls rubbed against Sams.  Then he began rhythmic thrusting, grasping Sams hair and shoulders as he forced himself into his virgin ass.

Danny came.  And Sam collapsed though full of arousal.  It wasn't long before the other three men had him flipped over, his cock in each of their mouths in turn, cumming and screaming.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Ok, so with rowing, when you reach the finish, your hands and the handle will be at your body (usually just below your chest) and your legs fully extended.  At this point, you shoot your arms away from you and *then* slide toward the catch once your arms clear your knees.  What generally happens though with less experienced rowers/ergers, is people will start to slide into the catch and *then* shoot their arms away.  When you slide into the catch, your knees rise up as you're compressing your legs.  So, you have raised knees but you're trying to shoot the arms away, so in order to not hit your knees, you have to lift your hands above your knees and then lower them once they pass the knees.  From the side view, this forms a /\ figure, or the triangles as I call it.  By shooting your arms and then coming into the catch, your hands clear the knees before they rise and you get a nice straight line all the way through the stroke.

Ive come to the conclusion that there isnt really a solution to the problem.  If you like her, stay with her, itll pay off.

However, keep in mind that as much as it doesnt seem this way, she usually is just saying that she doesnt feel pretty, to get attention. If youre sincere, she knows that you think shes great.  So tell her shes great if she is. When she says she isn't, just tell her she is.  Eventually, she'll realize that no matter how hard she tries, *you* wont abuse her.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","You get harmonics for any AC system (but they exist for DC as well), or whenever there is a non-linear load connected (which is everything other than a purely resistive component-which is still non-linear but to a lesser extent). 

Anyways, solar diodes are non-linear. And while I'm sure a solar farm will filter out the system before its connected, filters are expensive and bulky. In a power grid consisting of small producers, its harder to enforce filtering before they connect to the grid. Not to mention that the harmonics as a whole will be a much higher percentage of the total power for semi-autonomous households (since what they produce will be closer to the peak voltage) as opposed to having a centralized system (which would be operating at a much higher voltage).

I would still like to see a semi-autonomous system eventually.","1288575904"

The ruling class does not hesitate to use the economy for political purposes.

This dynamic was clear following the 1981 election of the French socialist president Mitterand. Though the French people voted for one economic program, industries and factories across France slowed down with many moving out of France to other European countries. Within only two years the plutocrats of France made Mitterand abandon the program he was elected to do.

In a less stark but more famous affair, early in his first term Bill Clinton launched into a curse-laden verbal tirade when told by his advisors that he could not implement the economic program the American people elected him to implement because the bond market and sections of Wall Street opposed his plan.","1288575933"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","That is something I find curious. How you can be a moderate (I'm happy that you are, no doubt) in a religion in which the religious book is God's direct word. It isn't something written by fallible men centuries or decades later, such as much of the Christian and Jewish religious texts, but it is the direct and precise word of God. If you do believe in Allah and the Quran then how can you choose to ignore certain parts of the texts? You can't do as the Christians and say ""Well, they probably meant it symbolically"" or ""We'll skip that part, it wasn't the direct word of God anyhow. Just men scribbling down their ideas and recollections"". From Wikipedia:

&gt; While religious books of most faiths acknowledge their human author's contribution to the divine text, the Qur'an claims to have been revealed word by word and letter by letter. Muslims believe that God revealed his final message to humanity through Muhammad ibn Abdullah (c. 570 - July 6, 632) via the angel Gabriel.[10] Muhammad is considered to have been God's final prophet. Muhammad's revelations form the holy book of Islam, the Qur'an. The Qur'an is believed by Muslims to be the flawless final revelation of God to humanity, valid until the day of the Resurrection http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation#Islam

If you believe in Allah and the Quran and choose to ignore parts of the text there are no ways of avoiding the fact that it is in direct violation of what God has specifically said.

Or perhaps you're mostly a cultural Muslim, actually?","1288575989"

The difference is usually so profound that I will stop listening to the song normally after I learn it.  I know about 150 songs, so it's starting to add up.  This also happens to a lesser extent if I start to actually think about the notes of any instrument in a song, so I try to avoid that.

I started playing guitar when I was 6 (now 25), so I really can't say how much it's helped me with deconstructing music because it's all I've ever known, but probably it has made it a lot easier.","1288576003"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The reason I started this thread is because, as part of a larger research project, I spent some time a few years ago tracking the careers of a set of people who were academic stars (there was a more objective criterion, but I can't say what it was) in college in 1988-92, meaning that they'd have been in their early 40s by now. The ones (about half) who went into academia did very well. The ones who went into the private sector did not fare as well as expected: people who ought to be hand-picked as proteges actually plateaued at the mid-level where they, presumably, got done in by mediocrities who were superior at office politics. It was eerie and actually quite disturbing. The typical left-wing gripe about society being run by intellectual mediocrities turned out, after objective inspection, to be true! I should state that I discovered this before the crash of 2008, which is when the fact that our corporate leaders are morons entered ""common knowledge"".

Well I realized too late the she was a person as well, and not just an extension of myself. Now that I know better I'm know that the next girl will present challenges in the relationship but the last person helped me to grow.

I don't think it will be easy to let go of this guy, but it will be great for him to realize his flaws and good for you because this isn't the person you fell in love with anymore.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;A scientific description or explanation of our emotions (love for another person, for example) is like a scientific description of a Shakespeare play or the Sistine ceiling. It's not enough.

This kind of reminds me of John Keats criticism of Isaac Newton for having destroyed the beauty of the rainbow by describing it. I do think science is enough and as good as art and beauty may make us feel, they are explainable and quantifiable. Just put someone in a brain scanner and show them a beautiful work of art. You'll be able to see exactly what parts of the brain are lighting up. Our reactions to art are nothing other than a series of complex chemical reactions in our brains. People just don't want to look at it this way for fear that this somehow diminishes the beauty.

&gt;Religion is just another type of artistic expression and, as I noted earlier, a symbolic or poetic expression of human psychology.

This is a great way of looking at it because as an atheist I think there is a lot of value in the philosophies of a lot of religions. It to me is like any other art. I don't *believe* in or *worship* classical music or poetry, I just enjoy them and take them with a grain of salt and the same goes with religion. It's all just human forms of expression. One thing I would like to ask though is that at first you said Jesus came to abolish religion, but now you say religion is art. Correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe there are two different types of religion. One, which Jesus came to abolish, is a institution of false dogma and imagined outside entities. The other is a human expression of art. It's a symbolic searching into our own psychology. Aldous Huxley describes in his perfect world that  ""Religion would be the conscious and intelligent pursuit of man's Final End, the unitive knowledge of immanent Tao or Logos, the transcendent Godhead or Brahman."" and Leo Tolstoy says ""The formation of this philosophy of life appropriate to humanity in the new conditions on which it is entering, and of the practice resulting from it, is what is called religion,"" in his book *The Kingdom of God is Within You*.","1288576063"

the one that will stick in my head forever... my junior year i had this class that was called ""adult recreation.""  we learned how to do stuff like bowl, play cribbage, play badminton, windsurf (kind of a stretch in an indoor pool), ski, stuff like that.  juniors and seniors shared the class, and i had a MAJOR crush on one of the senior guys.  we'd spend most of the class time talking, i'd give him backrubs all hour, even got groped a few times in the pool (during the windsurfing bit).  so i'm waiting, and waiting, and waiting for him to ask me to prom.  or hell, even ask me OUT on a real DATE for that matter.  nope, nothing.  i think i even asked him to prom, just be told ""i don't think i want to go at all.""

i find out later, during play practice, that the snobbiest, most stuck up self-centered diva in the school is going to prom with him.  that news simultaneously broke my heart and sealed my everlasting hate for her (ok 20 years later, it's everlasting sneering and annoyance that she wastes someone else's oxygen).

i did get some sweet redemption later, though.  i found out later that he really didn't want to go to prom, couldn't stand her, only asked her because he'd been at her house (parents were friends) and she wouldn't shut up about it, and ended up ignoring her all night and ditched her at a party.","1288576084"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","I'm not by any means a file systems expert.  But it's my understanding that Samsung took the time to develop RFS (probably before the Galaxy S was introduced but I can't say for sure) and someone there made the decision to use it on these phones.  Whether it is to get RFS more widespread in the hopes that it would become more widely adopted (in which case it's pretty obviously backfired among those would be adopting it) or perhaps it was Samsung's way of slightly crippling the phone, so you'll want a faster one next year, or if it was some other reason, I don't think anyone outside of Samsung knows for sure.  Some filesystems use less energy to perform their operations than others, I don't know if that's the case with RFS, but even if it is, it's certainly sacrificing performance at the expense of battery.  

Also, keep in mind that the management of Samsung mobile isn't the same as the other Samsung divisions.  Samsung mobile has clearly made some questionable choices in the past, but, aside from RFS, which is really a very easy fix, they've done a great job I think with the Galaxy phones.  ","1288576095"

2. Yes, although its not very scientific. Go to ""Users/(user name)/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/saves/World #"" and start deleting folders and/or the files inside them. You might want to back it up since you don't know which chunks are which and you might accidentally delete your base or something else that you wanted to save. Use Cartographer after you delete a chunk so you know what chunks got deleted.

3. Yep, there is a way to do that too. Figure out what chunk(s) your base is on, along with any other chunks you might want.And copy the folders and files that make up those chunks. Then generate a new world and walk around a bit so it generates a good bit more chunks. Delete chunks that have the same names as your base chunks along with a few extras that were near it (so that when you paste in the old ones, the game can generate some chunks that transition from the new world to the old chunks.) and then paste in the chunks you took from the old world. It might not look pretty, but it should work.

Hope that wasn't too confusing.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","Yeah, I'd like to have a discussion about this if you want to.  On point, what really gets to me is the increased rate of disease, et all, within the US.  Are the majority of us generally terrible eaters, or do we follow a diet tauted by science to be healthy when really we're among the only ones getting these terrible things because of it?

Many will argue whether that it comes down to being overweight that's causing the problems, if diabetes (etc) and obesity come from the same source, or if weight has little, nothing, or only one part to do with it and it all hinges on diet.  There is no telling, as a lot of people who have diseases are not overweight.  A lot of them are.  Are the fit ones just coincidence?  *Do* the problems mentioned above come from the same source (whatever that may be)?

It either comes down to us being lazy/poor eaters, or people in the US misled into doing things incorrectly.  As for the latter, for instance, saturated fat has never been proven unhealthy.  The initial study was based on shaky foundations, and remained a hypothesis - not a theory - but a vastly popular one that caught on.  This is why Crisco became so popular in the 50's.  They thought trans fats were better.  Now [some think](http://www.health-report.co.uk/saturated_fats_health_benefits.htm) saturated fats are fundamental to good health.

There's also sound evidence that a carbohydrate diet, sold to us as healthy, may cause disease, such as diabetes (which can cause a lot of other things).  This happens when the carbs break down into their sugar forms (glucose, sucrose, dextrose, fructose) by the liver, which causes a spike in insulin.  By eating so many carbs (white flour, breads, pasta, etc. - yes, even whole grain) we make more insulin (for the -oseses), and over time we grow completely resistant to it (type-2 diabetes).

I could go further, but I'd like your input about these things.","1288576112"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;Religion itself hasn't contributed to science; some religious people have contributed to science, but a that's different to the religion itself.

Um, so who paid for the Hagia Sophia then?  The Pyramids?  Mendel did is work trying to serve God by better understanding the universe that ""He"" created, (I'm sure some of it was boredom, but that was mostly a joke).  Ironically, many scientists such as those during the Muslim Golden Age essentially invented modern science as we know it in an effort to better understand their God's world and by extension, their God.

On that note, let's discuss the contributions to the arts.  The Sistine Chapel?  The statue of David?  Took three years to carve that.  Who was paying the guy who delivered fresh bread and wine to poor Michelangelo?

&gt;because their bible says being gay is so wrong

As I mentioned before.  Some people just hate folks who are different from them (read: blacks, gays, etc).  If they weren't religiously motivated, there would be another motivation.  I mean, look at the KKK.  They don't hate blacks for religious reasons, they simply consider blacks as invaders and think that they will destroy white culture.

Why the cross?

&gt;The practice of cross burning had been loosely based on ancient Scottish clans' burning a St. Andrew's cross (an X-shaped cross) as a beacon to muster forces for war.

&gt;in The Birth of a Nation; he mistakenly portrayed the burning cross as an upright Latin cross rather than the St. Andrew's cross

Doesn't seem like a a very religious organization to me.

Going back to your previous points, if the Bible was the only motivation for hating gays, why would people choose to ignore the rest of Leviticus such as Shatnez where it says that you can't mix wool and linen?  Obviously they just hate gays and use their religion to justify it.  If they weren't religious, they'd find something else.

Also, DADT isn't being held because of any religious motivation.  It's just a logistical nightmare to repeal over night.  Do gays get their own showers? Do they bunk with other gays? With straights?  What are the rules?  These are the kinds of things that need to be figured out before DADT can realistically be repealed.  People who hate gays would probably not like them serving in the forces at all even if they ""Don't Tell.""

&gt;However, religion, to some, is like a catalyst that brings out the worst in them.

Or [the best in them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_World_Service)

Or [the best in them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous#Effectiveness)

Or [the best in them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army)

Sure, the Salvation army refuses to hire gays, but isn't it throwing the baby out with the bath water to discount the entire organization and all of the good that they do because of that one thing?

If you're really concerned about planes in buildings or stem cell research, why don't you just knock on Muslim extremists and Fundamentalist Christians?  There are a lot of folks who are happy and peaceful, and certainly would not like having their beliefs considered a ""disease.""

Jesus dude, you claim that you're not closed minded, but you really are simply ignoring all of the points that disagree with your worldview.  Just because you haven't witnessed all of this during your lifetime doesn't mean that it didn't happen.

I think it's fine to hate on the assholes, but you need to realize that in the grand scheme of things, religion is irrelevant in the good or the bad parts of society.

One of those happens to branch off of a large pathway of nerves on one side.  As the heart and all those other connections drop into the torso, the loop lengthens.

Anyway, that whole 5 minute cartoons boils down to this:

Boy: Woof! You sure gotta climb a lot of steps to get to this Capitol Building here in Washington. But I wonder who that sad little scrap of paper is?

I'm just a bill.
Yes, I'm only a bill.
And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill.
Well, it's a long, long journey
To the capital city.
It's a long, long wait
While I'm sitting in committee,
But I know I'll be a law someday
At least I hope and pray that I will,
But today I am still just a bill.

Boy: Gee, Bill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage.

Bill: Well I got this far. When I started, I wasn't even a bill, I was just an idea. Some folks back home decided they wanted a law passed, so they called their local Congressman and he said, ""You're right, there oughta be a law."" Then he sat down and wrote me out and introduced me to Congress. And I became a bill, and I'll remain a bill until they decide to make me a law.

I'm just a bill
Yes I'm only a bill,
And I got as far as Capitol Hill.
Well, now I'm stuck in committee
And I'll sit here and wait
While a few key Congressmen discuss and debate
Whether they should let me be a law.
How I hope and pray that they will,
But today I am still just a bill.

Boy: Listen to those congressmen arguing! Is all that discussion and debate about you?

Bill: Yeah, I'm one of the lucky ones. Most bills never even get this far. I hope they decide to report on me favourably, otherwise I may die.

Boy: Die?

Bill: Yeah, die in committee. Oooh, but it looks like I'm gonna live! Now I go to the House of Representatives, and they vote on me.

Boy: If they vote yes, what happens?

Bill: Then I go to the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again.

Boy: Oh no!

Bill: Oh yes!

I'm just a bill
Yes, I'm only a bill
And if they vote for me on Capitol Hill
Well, then I'm off to the White House
Where I'll wait in a line
With a lot of other bills
For the president to sign
And if he signs me, then I'll be a law.
How I hope and pray that he will,
But today I am still just a bill.

Boy: You mean even if the whole Congress says you should be a law, the president can still say no?

Bill: Yes, that's called a veto. If the President vetoes me, I have to go back to Congress and they vote on me again, and by that time you're so old...

Boy: By that time it's very unlikely that you'll become a law. It's not easy to become a law, is it?

Bill: No!

But how I hope and I pray that I will,
But today I am still just a bill.

Congressman: He signed you, Bill! Now you're a law!

If you are comfortable with the product rule: If you have two functions f(x) and g(x) and there are derivatives f'(x) and g'(x) then the derivative of h(x) = f(x)*g(x) is expressible in terms of the derivatives of f(x) and g(x): h'(x) = f'(x)*g(x) + f(x)*g'(x).

Then the chain rule is similar: If you have two functions f(x) and g(x) and there are derivatives f'(x) and g'(x) then the derivative of h(x) = (fog)(x) = f(g(x)) is expressible in terms of the derivatives of f(x) and g(x): h'(x) = f'(g(x))*g'(x).

Why is the chain rule true? It is easiest to see if you recall the definition of the derivative in terms of the limit:

f'(x) = (f(x+h) - f(x))/h as h -&gt; 0

So

(fog)(x) = (f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x)))/h

but this is equal to

(f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x)))/(g(x+h) - g(x)) * (g(x+h) - g(x))/h

as h -&gt; 0 the fraction on the lefthand side goes to f'(g(x)) and the fraction on the righthand side goes to g'(x).

So (fog)'(x) = f'(g(x))*g'(x).

"politics","t5_2cneq","Except that initial plans to invade Iraq were in the pipeline BEFORE 9/11, and there are documents to prove it. And Iraq started 2 years after 9/11, plenty of time for people to have calmed down slightly, if the neocons (and Bush/Cheney) hadn't WANTED them to remain all hyped up.

However, all the Neocons actually need is for Israel to create any kind of false flag atack that can be traced to Iran, and the USA will immediately rush in to support Israel. That may not include a ""boots on the ground"" invasion, but would certainly include a ""shock and awe"" bombing campaign aimed at wrecking Iran infrastructure.

So far, the main thing that has stopped this, is Israel's uncertanity about what would be needed to get the USA to jump in as support, since there is no way they want to start a war with Iran and end up alone.

And even if the USA has designated MEK as a terrorist organisation, they have continued to fund and train them for a couple of decades.","1288576200"

Welcome to GatorChat!

You are being connected to a representative in our Billing department right now.

For immediate answers to your questions, check out our knowledge base and video tutorials at http://support.hostgator.com.

Your Chat ID is 2738644.

Your question is, ""My primary domain is 'domainname.com'. I've just been made aware that hostgator's billing servers have been compromised and need to verify this. If this is true I will most likely have to switch to another hosting company""

(08:29:08 PM) System: There are currently 5 people in front of you and 46 chat technicians assisting customers.

(08:29:37 PM) System: There are currently 4 people in front of you and 46 chat technicians assisting customers.

(08:29:56 PM) Wa: has entered the chat.

(08:30:04 PM) Wa: Hello, welcome to HostGator Live Chat.

(08:30:09 PM) Wa: We have not been compromised, no.

(08:31:16 PM) ME: I've been made aware of this from another individual. You may not know this because you work as tech support and it has not been passed down the line.... HOSTGATOR'S billing servers HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED!!!

(08:32:27 PM) ME: ""the entire blade of billing servers were compromised and that all the credit card information stored in the recurring billing database was stolen and is now entirely in the wind; This includes full credit card numbers, expiration dates and CVV2 codes.

This company has chosen to hide this fact instead of report it to the appropriate authorities so I spoke out against them anonymously in a thread they keep stickied in SA-Mart in order to warn others that they should take the proper precautions with their financial data. Unfortunately, due to the amount of money they are paying Lowtax for advertisement, you are entirely unable to speak out against them despite whatever proof you may have; they went ahead and banned me. They even edited my posts and removed all the information I posted as a warning.

They've already provided all my IP and e-mail address information to the company and I've been fired so I couldn't care less what's going to happen from here. A friend of mine recommended I post this information here so that the few people who may read this could get the word out and let people know that it's really not safe to trust SA. The administration isn't about exchange of information or the formation of a strong community, they are about the all-mighty dollar""

(08:33:15 PM) ME: I should rectify the above by stating that this is a quote from someone that served in a capacity with the company as a system administrator

(08:33:29 PM) Wa: Sir we have not had any problems with anything like that.

(08:34:49 PM) Jr: Ok Wa, I have recorded this conversation for the record. I am very concerned about this and do understand that you may not be privy to this information. This will show acknowledgement that I have contacted Hostgator about this issue

(08:35:08 PM) ME: Thank you very much, I won't take up anymore of your time.....

(08:35:38 PM) Wa: Please allow me a moment to check into this for you.

(08:37:02 PM) ME: Is is currently on reddit.com http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/

(08:40:07 PM) Wa: I was correct, in saying that the statement is 100% false. You have nothing to worry about.

(08:41:43 PM) ME: Ok, thank you very much Wa.... I have recorded this conversation and transcript will be made available on reddit.com amongst other places. I don't mean to place you into a tight spot, but I know you are only going with information that you have been informed of....... Thank You Very Much

(08:42:13 PM) Wa: No problem at all. Was there anything else I could do for you while I still have you in chat?

(08:42:26 PM) ME: No sir thats it, thank you very much

(08:43:31 PM) Wa: Okay, take care and have a great rest of the day!

Regardless. I agree that the BCS is a monopoly and the AQ vs. non-AQ breakdown is unfair. I think there should be some sort of 8-team playoff (possibly in a plus-one format) that combines the bowl system with an on-the-field decision for the national title.

As a side-note, it's worth mentioning that this debate did not begin with the BCS. In 1997 Nebraska and Michigan both went undefeated, didn't have a chance to play each other in the bowl season, and both claimed a national championship. There are many, many other years with dual champion claims, as well.","1288576323"

Numerous artists mix lyrics from both versions, and occasionally make direct lyric changes, such as Rufus Wainwright, a Canadian-American singer, substituting ""holy dark"" and Allison Crowe, a Canadian singer-songwriter, substituting ""Holy Ghost"" for ""holy dove"".""

The stats aren't bullshit. Your self-serving use of only two years to prove Reagan destroyed the economy is bullshit. The economy started getting better at the exact point where you stopped. That's you using data selectively to lie.

&gt; You're using my St Louis fed link, not my BLS link.

Both fucking links show the same thing.

&gt; I quote numbers from St Louis fed and BLS. That's an odd way to say they support me.

They don't support you, because you only picked the numbers that supported your claim.

&gt; Er, math challenged? You own chart shows it declines in the third year.

Reagan was inaugurated in January 1981. 1983 was only two years after that. Math fail much?

&gt; During Jimmy Carter's last full month in office, Dec 1980, the unemployment rate was 7.2%. It takes Reagan four years to get back to there.

Pointless. It was rising before Carter left office. A presidents actions don't take effect that quickly. The trend from Carter's administration was rising unemployment. What is your thesis? That Reagan got into office, and suddenly, in the same month that he was inaugurated, his policies caused a reverse time loop that started a rising trend of unemployment. Wow, Reagan must be a time lord.

&gt; Just about where it was in the Carter administration in 1979, just before the arab oil embargo.

Good. So you admit that it went to shit in Carters term, and Reagan didn't magically cause unemployment to go up immediately upon being inaugurated. Glad we corrected that stupidity.","1288576352"

The major part of a romantic relationship with a member of the opposite gender is the intense friendship. There's nothing really there if you don't bond with each other emotionally and mentally. Is sex really relevant? Of course, yes physical touch is a good part of human interaction. However, it also occurs in other contexts. I feel very emotionally rewarded when cuddling a child - and oftentimes the bonds I have with children are quite intense, because of the needs that child sees might be able to be fulfilled with me. 

Frankly, I believe that sex has become seriously overrated in the West over the last sixty years. Recently, one big thought I had was there are three big detours that people go down trying to find personal fulfillment - sex, politics, and religion.

I think that finding one's people - and actually forging the right friendships with the right people is the holy grail. It's the real foundation for a happy life.","1288576355"

Still, he says there should be a one-time 15 percent surtax on the wealthy that he estimates would cut the national debt in half.

""In 1985, the top five percent of the households, wealthiest five percent, had net worth of $8 trillion, which is a lot. Today, after serial bubble after serial bubble, the top five percent have net worth of $40 trillion,"" he explained. ""The top five percent have gained more wealth than the whole human race had created prior to 1980."" ","1288576373"

Religion is a tough, tough beast. I know you can't fight it with facts, and you can't sell the same emotion to everybody. The ""imagine a world without religion"" campaign that featured an image of the burning twin towers failed universally because Christians blamed it on the Muslims, and the Muslims I've spoken to said it's the extremists that aren't really Muslims at all. They're actually all correct. This campaign backfired because it strengthened their own beliefs.

This series helped me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12rP8ybp13s

Frankly, the only known effective method is to teach science. Once you teach science, belief in creationism starts to crumble, and the rest falls away with it. Not always, but the better the scientific education, the less religious a person also is.

There is a quaint little catch-22 in selling, that you should never sell. :-p You can inform, you can ask questions that are designed to make people think and come to their own conclusions, but you can't force your will on someone else.

Perhaps the only way to get people to think rationally is to teach it to them before it's too late.","1288576374"

"Hypothyroidism","t5_2s0tv","I went to one after regular docs dismissed me and he was a complete quack- total waste of $200.  That being said, the current treatment standards are so lacking in evidence that a naturopath could be worth trying.  

Many people do much better on a Natural Dessicated Thyroid medication instead of one of the synthetic ones.  You would not believe how much better my mom is on NDT than Synthroid.  [This is a locator for doctors who have prescribes Armour- one of the major NDT brands](http://www.armourthyroid.com/con_phLocator.aspx). [Another site with info on finding a doc](http://www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/how-to-find-a-good-doc/) Word of warning on Armour- it was reformulated and now has to be chewed or crushed to work. &gt;_&lt;

I gave up on finding a doctor and am taking an Armour knock-off from an Indian online pharmacy and very happy with it.  I'll dig out which company it is if you are interested.  That can take a few months to ship though- I used [these](http://www.nutri-meds.com/Nutri_Meds_Desiccated_Porcine_Thyroid_Capsules_p/nm-g-ptc.htm) and was happy with them except that they wore off very quickly and they are expensive considering how many I had to take every day but they did ship very quickly.

It is also likely that you are being under treated.  My mom's TSH was 1-something and she was miserable- she had to get it dang close to 0 to feel well.  The TSH test is an [extremely lousy tool](http://www.thyroidscience.com/Criticism/lowe.dec.2006/lowe.critique.T4.T4.T3.studies.pdf) for evaluating whether or not a patient is getting enough replacement medication. I can dig out more links to support assertion that if you are interested.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The ""social restrictions, imperialist foreign policy and underlying theocratic basis"" aren't necessarily conservative ideals.  They are other ideologies that have been held by some people who portray themselves as conservatives.

Really all of these titles are as subjective as the people claiming them.  They change from generation to generation and are in a constant state of reinvention.  

What I mean when I say that I am a conservative is that in any question concerning government I think the least amount used is always the best answer.  I think government should be conserved to the smallest amount necessary and given the smallest amount of power necessary for it to operate.  I think government, by its very nature is an enemy to a free people, as the people must give up personal liberty to it, in order for it to exist.  I think government or more precisely ""authority"" is necessary to keep the people out of an anarchist state though, so should exist.  

Being a conservative has nothing to do with religion but the religious have been historically conservative in their governmental views.  At one time government was the enemy of many religions.  The separation of church and state was as much a protection of the church from the state as it was protection of state from the church.

1. The brother the protagonist killed was a doppelganger. The real brother was lost in the woods.

2. The real brother returns. He laughs, smiles, and credits his brother with the ""good"" deed in public, but in his heart knows what his brother intended and can't bear to look at him anymore. He somehow knows what truly happened, perhaps he witnessed it from a distance.

3. The protagonist starts freaking out. Meanwhile, his brother starts to calmly dig a hole. Why? Because the brother is planning on doing to the protagonist exactly what the protagonist thought he had done to his brother...mainly kill him and throw him down a deep hole. The brother plots revenge for having been ""murdered"".

4. Before the brother can carry out his murder however, the guilt-ridden protagonist walks out into the forest and climbs down the original hole, hoping to find out once and for all what became of his ""brother"". He finds the doppelganger at the bottom, and finds he had not quite finished killing it...(and is presumably killed by it shortly after).

&gt;I'd just like to voice my concern that this new show ""Ghost Lab"" violates the standards of quality of your network. As you and I both know, ghosts are not real and shows about ghosts are at best lame and at worst smut.

&gt;Your network has earned a reputation of having valuable and thoughtful entertainment oriented toward education, science and rationality. Yet this show seems an appalling abuse of that reputation.

The future anarchists will not attack the state ... the state and all of it assumed power will simply be disregarded.  If the state responds with violence in order to protect its illegitimate power, THEN the anarchist responds in self defense.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I would imagine that the damage to the needle tip would be significantly less - tissue tends to be fairly damaging to them.  In contrast a smooth, homogeneous substance like rubber probably damages them significantly less.  Ex: drawing from ampules and injecting into flesh is fine, but most IM injections aren't in the same spot, aren't regular, and are done in a clean environment with proper protocol.  From what I heard I don't think that the damage to needles from tissue is observable to the human eye - but I don't really have any experience with this, as I've never came into contact / inspected needles used more than once.  Generally speaking I don't even closely inspect needles that have been used even once; mostly because I don't really like getting things that have been inside other people near me (disease, ick).  In reality the only real issues are with repeated use in tissue, generally in heavily used, non-rotated injection sites, generally under rather unclean circumstances.  As an example of what I'm talking about, we had to teach our IDUs to take water from the top of the tank, rather than the bowl of the toilet; some of them would end up shooting in public restrooms. In situations like these we would revert to general advice, attempting to educate about a 'harm reduction spectrum', rather than proper technique.  

I don't know for sure though - this is just postulation on my part.  I have a few needles lying around though, I might take one for the team and prick myself a few times later on and see what I come up with.  Perhaps crowning is observable to the human eye.  ","1288576467"

&gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

See?  So when a person asks somebody to leave his property, he is not restricting the right of free assembly.  When a day care employee prohibits a child from saying 'motherfucker', there is no free speech issue.  When a catholic church forbids the practice of Buddhism within its walls, it is not preventing the free exercise of religion.  This is because only congress has an obligation to refrain from making restrictions like these.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; The difference between ethics and morals can seem somewhat arbitrary to many, but there is a basic, albeit subtle, difference. Morals define personal character, while ethics stress a social system in which those morals are applied. In other words, ethics point to standards or codes of behavior expected by the group to which the individual belongs. This could be national ethics, social ethics, company ethics, professional ethics, or even family ethics. So while a person’s moral code is usually unchanging, the ethics he or she practices can be other-dependent.

I know everyone says it, but you will know when the right time is to let your dog go. Usually if dogs aren't eating when they are sick or old, they most likely need to be put down.

Right there you wasted a chrono. 

Also, earlier on you had built an assimilator at 14 (good) but then didn't assign any probes to it after it had finished (bad). What's the point of spending the extra 75 minerals early if you're not going to use it just then? Little things like this add up. 

Also, there were several times when you had idle warpgates and money to spend on troops, but you didn't. You don't want to keep five stalkers in the bank, you want to put them out on the field where they can do some good.

The three potential reasons that I could think of:

* They're voting based on subjective opinion. In their opinion, when watching Boise State play and watching Auburn play, they believe that Boise State is the ""better"" team and have decided to reflect that in their polls.

* Boise got there first. They had Boise State high in their rankings earlier in the year (when Auburn was basically an unknown), and they don't like to ""penalize"" teams unless they lose.

* They disagree with the way that the BCS is constructed and believe that every undefeated team should have the right to play for the national championship regardless of their schedule. In this case, the Boise #1 or #2 vote is purely politics and Auburn just happens to be an innocent bystander.

That said, Auburn improved in the human polls this week, just as they have the last several weeks. Unless Oregon or Auburn lose, they are your NCG teams.

&gt;You're not even asking the most fundamental question in this matter!

I have asked this question before (obviously not in this thread), and have found the same exact answer you present. It's not that hard to find when people just do a small bit of research on the matter. However, it is NOT the most fundamental question. It's not a simple matter of 'well, the US just one day decided to kill a bunch of Muslims, and now certain Muslims want revenge'. I don't exactly think that the Iraq sanctions were designed for no other purpose than to kill a bunch of Muslims. Were the sanctions executed perfectly? Of course not. But the fact that they were not is not some kind of proof that they only occurred so the US could have more power. 

I mean, I totally get your point that one should not simplify the situation by saying 'Al-Qaida attacked us, so we need to get revenge', but at the same time, you shouldn't be making the argument that it's as simple as 'the US let many Muslims die, so they needed to get revenge.'

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","This is actually the one thing that annoys me most about my witness upbringing and (still active) witness mother- more than the holidays, or guilt, or lack of friends, or standard issue religious indoctrination- the fact that had I been in a childhood accident that required me to have a blood transfusion or die, I have no doubt that I'd be dead.

According to JWs, blood is sacred because it represents life, but for some reason they don't think that the life itself is more sacred than the symbol. It's like a husband who keeps his wedding ring shiny because it represents his marriage but cheats on his wife.

And without getting too much into the doctrine, there's a scripture in which King David and his army eats meat that was not properly bled because they were starving and would die otherwise, and god forgives them. Why? Because actual human life is more sacred than a symbol of human life or any law about honoring the symbol. If the society ever wanted to, they could use that scripture to justify a change in doctrine. But that will never happen because then they'd have to admit to all those families who let their kids die ""for Jehovah"" that they'd made a mistake.

Coming to that realization about the ""Blood Issue"" was a major step towards deciding to leave.

@dashikismalls: Speaking of blood and things you've never done because you were a JW, you should make an appointment with the Red Cross to donate blood. It's very therapeutic, way more than all the sex and drugs you're surely involved in by now (kidding). ","1288576578"

With our current understanding, it would appear so that it isn't the most efficient model, but it's a working, functional model. That is to say, what if in order for this to be functional, it must appear as inefficient because it's the only way it can work. So I wonder, if any surgical reported cases exists of a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve that directly supplies the lower larynx after branching from the vagus. If it works just as well and systemic physiology is also normal, then perhaps it is innocently an artifact of evolution or someone made a non-compromising design flaw.","1288576579"

Steve McIntyre : 
""Making readers run the gauntlet of trying to guess the precise data sets
and precise methodologies obviously makes it very difficult to achieve any
assessment of the statistical properties. In order to test the GISS
adjustments, I requested that GISS provide me with details on their
adjustment code. They refused. Nevertheless, there are enough different
versions of U.S. station data (USHCN raw, USHCN time-of-observation
adjusted, USHCN adjusted, GHCN raw, GHCN adjusted) that one can compare GISS
raw and GISS adjusted data to other versions to get some idea of what they
did.""
""In the course of reviewing quality problems at various surface sites,
among other things, I compared these different versions of station data,
including a comparison of the Tucson weather station shown above to the
Grand Canyon weather station, which is presumably less affected by urban
problems. This comparison demonstrated a very odd pattern discussed
here. The adjustments show that the trend in the problematic Tucson site
was reduced in the course of the adjustments, but they also showed that the
Grand Canyon data was also adjusted, so that, instead of the 1930s being
warmer than the present as in the raw data, the 2000s were warmer than the
1930s, with a sharp increase in the 2000s.

Figure 6. Comparison of Tucson and Grand Canyon Versions

Now some portion of the post-2000 jump in adjusted Grand Canyon values
shown here is due to Hansen’s Y2K error, but it only accounts for a 0.5 deg
C jump after 2000 and does not explain why Grand Canyon values should have
been adjusted so much. In this case, the adjustments are primarily at the
USHCN stage. The USHCN station history adjustments appear particularly
troublesome to me, not just here but at other sites (e.g. Orland CA). They
end up making material changes to sites identified as “good” sites and my
impression is that the USHCN adjustment procedures may be adjusting some of
the very “best” sites (in terms of appearance and reported history) to
better fit histories from sites that are clearly non-compliant with WMO
standards (e.g. Marysville, Tucson). There are some real and interesting
statistical issues with the USHCN station history adjustment procedure and
it is ridiculous that the source code for these adjustments (and the
subsequent GISS adjustments – see bottom panel) is not available/

Closing the circle: my original interest in GISS adjustment procedures
was not an abstract interest, but a specific interest in whether GISS
adjustment procedures were equal to the challenge of “fixing” bad data. If
one views the above assessment as a type of limited software audit (limited
by lack of access to source code and operating manuals), one can say firmly
that the GISS software had not only failed to pick up and correct fictitious
steps of up to 1 deg C, but that GISS actually introduced this error in the
course of their programming.""

This of course is just one instance where GISS has been caught engaging in this sort of nonsense....There have been many other examples  such as not applying  UHI corrections to a location with urban heating thereby making it appear to be a rural station and therefore the higher temperatures are ""PROOF"" of global warming.","1288576580"

"Atlanta","t5_2qiq9","That's true but look at a population and business density map and you'll see that the area of town that can actuall support transit is midtown and downtown.  The beltline density won't come close for 20 years.  The grant Atlanta just won for the street car along Edgewood is the type of plan that serves what's already there.  The Beltline will help planners direct where things develop, and how.  Both are valuable, but the criticism is that the beltline is taking resources that could be applied to projects which might actually be useful right away.  There's plenty of evidence that a streetcar can be successfully installed in an already developed area... Seattle, Charlotte, Denver, Salt Lake City, Portland to name just a few. And keep in mind, all I am doing is relaying the pros and cons.  I'm not trying to be critical. Final note, I've studied City Planning at Georgia Tech where the beltline was conceived by Ryan Gravel.  I went to school with folks who are working on it.  In general, I am very excited about it, but we must be cautious and realistic about the challenges.  For example, there are 4 serious breaks in the continuity that we currently have no good solution for; particularly at Dekalb Ave on the East.

"PHP","t5_2qh38","Assuming that's all the information you have to go on then storing the size, backing, color in separate tables is a good start.  You'll want to create a view that will pull every permutation of values from those tables.

    CREATE VIEW AllCombinations
    AS
    SELECT Sizes.SizeID, Backings.BackingID, Colors.ColorID
    FROM Sizes, Backings, Colors

Your exclusion table will have at least three fields corresponding to each primary key of each table.  If you want a catch-all ""wildcard"" then there are a few ways to go about it.  Unfortunately most ways will end up sacrificing normal form.  But I'll assume you aren't too interested in the normality of your database.

Let's assume that in each of your attribute tables (size, backing, color) you store the primary key as a smallint, and you use 0 to designate wildcard.  So for example your Colors table might look like this:  0 - All Colors, 1 - Blue, 2 - Green, 3 - Red, etc.

Here's one way you might do the join:

    CREATE VIEW ValidCombinations
    AS
    SELECT A.*
    FROM AllCombinations A
    LEFT JOIN ExclusionTable E ON (
        (E.SizeID = A.SizeID OR E.SizeID = 0) AND

Man seems to create (this whole software discussion) along the same lines as God (because life/DNA/evolution has quite a few parallels to it). Just on a lot less grander of a scale. If there is a Creator, does it look at us like we look at objects in code?

But even if you've started to 'figure them out' a bit, remember that it may still be a terrible, terrible idea to use it as rhetorical ammunition against them. I fell into this trap when I conflicted (more) with my own parents. It was clear to me where everything they did sprang from (and maybe to them as well)... that didn't mean I could just explain that to them and they'd realize how stupid and arbitrary their actions were.

On the internet, everyone's a doctor... you don't know she is bipolar. But even if she is, and knows it, *and knows that her condition may affect her decisions*, it might still not be to your advantage to point these things out. Just knowing what drives us doesn't always loosen its hold on us. In family arguments, it doesn't always matter who is right.

I'm sure you may know people who are fat, and hate being fat. Maybe some of them don't know how to lose weight--but many of them surely know exactly what to do, want very badly to do it, and *still don't*... still *can't.* We are all trapped within our own minds.

I don't see how having a js api for custom components will help alleviate this though.

The best we can do is standardize the way that people currently do things.

Because actually having CSS be more than just a static set of key/value pairs will make debugging stylesheets a nightmare.

On the other hand, if you're looking at a place with 20 year old windows, leaks around the doors, and an air conditioner that can barely keep the place cool no matter how much it's running, you probably want to spend significantly less than 650 to account for the extra utilities.

There is a large number of inconsistencies in the theory of evolution that scientists have ignored in order for their theory to be proven true (I'm sure I could go on some creationist website and find some). I feel like saying that all in caps, but I'm not an immoral atheist.

When the bible has been wrong in the past, it's usually been a case where there was a misinterpretation about what god meant.

When the world thought that the earth of flat, the bible said in various verses the earth was round.

When the scientific community thought the sun revolved around the earth, the bible on the otherhand says in a number of verses that the sun moves around the earth.

If you have no direct experience with your countries religion, I am appaled at the state of religious education in Ireland. Try this, next time your are having trouble, pray to our lord and you will be helped, unless of course the lord decides to save you and bring you to heaven where you can live in happiness for eternity. This will happen every time.

Complete belief in god generates reproducible results in a better life and after life, which can be demonstrated in various churches and support groups, such as AA, around the country. Even the scientific community admits that it is possible for all the species on the earth to fit on a moderately large boat. Your belief is *not* blind.


SORRY for trolling there, but I want to get my point across. I feel ignorant basing my views on other people. However the comments here have helped me understand why I believe, I still would find it difficult to uphold my side in an argument.","1288576665"

Just to call out some interesting examples of popular crosses of sativa and indica variants: Mango smells like fruit, ChemDog smells like a meth lab, the various Diesels smell like truck accidents, and all have very different effects.  There will probably be some big winners, especially at first with the novelty of legalization, but the cannabis market is ideal for marketing of variation that is not what big companies do best.

Much of the biggest money seems to be in the related social sphere.  Cannabis themed events, publications, and concerts are already some of the top money makers even without legalization.  That won't necessarily change once growers, distributors, and sellers are in the open.","1288576667"

Also, they were married (partly for political reasons to solidify support of another tribe) but did not consummate the marriage until she was several years older.

Tribal custom 1400 years ago meant that people got married at or after puberty (since life expectancy was so low). It wasn't his idea to marry her, but it came from the women in his family. The polytheists of Mecca had a lot of problems and railed against him for everything he did, but that was one of the few things that they didn't criticize him for.

I find it so odd that Christians and the like criticize this, since their Bible has prophets engaging in incest etc. (Muslims don't believe those stories happened.) Considering how 1400 years ago in Europe there were families marrying children at birth (check Ripley's Believe It or Not), it's an odd criticism to make for anyone, since nobody cared 1400 years ago and yes, times have changed.","1288576703"

You can find good deals on racquetworld.com, rbdepot.com and of course eBay. Just look around, there aren't too many online racquetball retailers and they usually have similar prices.  I have more experience with ektelon than with any other company, but you really can't go wrong with a Head, eforce or Wilson racquet either.  In terms of figuring out a good racquet for yourself, you can demo three racquets for 25 bucks from racquetworld.com or by finding a local tournament or demo day where there will usually be reps there to talk to and try stuff out.  I would guess you want something between 170-185 grams, which is in the mid to high weight range which will give you good power and stability ( I'm guessing you don't have the fastest swingspeed, if so get a lighter racquet). I bought an Ektelon Speedport red, which has adjustable weight plugs so you can try out different weights all while using the same racquet.  You might be able to get a deal on it now. 

In terms of grip size you probably want the smallest you can get. I wear an xl glove and still opt for the smaller grip sizes of the two available

"gaming","t5_2qh03","i treated it the same way i treated Fable 2, kinda like the story and gameplay so i rent it for a weekend, by the time i finish the story and a couple funny side quests i'm sick of the gameplay so its perfect time to go return it. ohh and the ending really annoyed me for a couple reasons SPOILERS (obviously)
[first off, jumping from 120 days left to 0 is fucking annoying, i was trying to make as much money as possible myself while doing at least semi-good so that on the last day i could sell every property and put all my money into the royal fund or whatever it was called to save as many people as possible (why not i was giving back the game an hour later anyway. Instead i'm left with a bit over 2 million so most people die, there isn't even a ""you will be very busy over the next 120 days so if you're wanting to get anything done before the mass of pure evil invades, you should do it now"". And secondly, the boss fight was far too easy and was exactly the same as the previous boss fights against the evil thing, i thought when it took over walter there would be at least mildly different fight mechanics and i might need to figure out a new strategy but nope, the same as always](/spoiler)

Other than that i liked the game but don't think i would end up playing it for much longer than the rental period even if i bought it, using your words, it was very 'meh' like i felt ther other fable games were.","1288576715"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My best friend is a girl I met when I was about 20, she was 17. We used to hang at the same place, a lot. We shared a passion for the same sort of literature and coffee. We weren't best friends back then, that came later. Together with her and what became some other mutual friends, we had some good fun for about two years or so, before other things in life consumed me, like having a girlfriend, and a job, and trying to get through college getting decent grades and so on. Plus a good few of our mutual friends left town, and there weren't too many chances for us to get together. 

So after about four years or so of running into her only on a few rare occasions, I wandered into the book store where she worked, looking for some undefined reading material. She was at work, and we spent quite a while discussing books and authors and stuff like that. Actually, we spent about an hour or so, and we really clicked again, and she told me that she was having a party that weekend and wondered if I wanted to come.  

The party was awesome, and I got to see a bunch of people I hadn't seen in years. I was also brought in as someone fresh to a whole lot of other people, and before I arrived, I had already been declared to be awesome. After that party, we started to go out for coffee, and we could earnestly talk about things. We could have the deep nonsensical conversations, or we could discuss the really serious things in life. We ended up partying together quite a lot. She hooked up with her boyfriend at my birthday party. I helped her boyfriend land his first proper job after he finished his degree due to my status as a job-pimp at the moment (don't ask, complicated story...)

In the end, I had to move in order to get a new job, and I'm currently stuck at the other end of the country, and now I'm realizing who one of my best friends in this world is. It's someone I only speak through via Skype, or talk to on the phone, and get to see for about ten days every year whenever we happen to be in the same city.

Still, I know that if my life started to fall apart, and I needed to ask someone to lend me a hand, it would be her. And I know that the help I would need is just a phone call away.","1288576719"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Agreed, and I would like to expand.  

(I may not explain this well, so forgive me.)

People (men and women) ARE shallow and often just go based on looks.  They get into relationships based on a sexual attraction and **a lack of important personality criteria.**  

As you get older and smarter, you start to develop a list of qualities that you require in a partner.  Looks are rarely on the top of the list.  

When I was younger, my list was something like:

1.  Female
2.  Will fuck me.
3.  Hot/sexy

As I got older, the list turned into something a LOT more specific, like this:

1. Is clinically sane.
2. Has integrity, made up of loyalty, trust, and honesty.
3. Is giving.
4. Displays flexibility. 
5. Strong libido, sexually adventurous and experienced.
6. Tall, skinny (as I am too)
7. Not smoker or drug user
8. Likes my dogs
9. No criminal record
10. Great cook, and likes cooking for me.
11. Owns a car and drives safely.
12. Lives no more than 15-20 minutes away from me.
13. Computer literate
14. Enjoys drinking on weekends, events
15. Good with kids
16. Very good with finances (not a gold digger or spend thrift)
17. Enjoys my company over all others.
18. Is hot/sexy/dresses nicely

I've met plenty of so-called stunning/sexy women in my day, and in my experience they are shallow, gold-digging, lying, cheating, uneducated, dysfunctional, boring, boorish, overly opinionated, bad lays, financially irresponsible, and so forth.  They are ""hollow"".  They may be good looking, but looks mean nothing when you're trying to have a conversation or the lights are off!

Over the years these ""hot"" women have almost ALL gained weight, ""given up"" on maintaining themselves, and otherwise have become the outwardly equivalent of their inner selves.  To be fair, I have also seen the same in the so-called ""great"" and ""hot"" guys.  One of the best looking guys I knew through school is now 300 pounds, round, bald, gray (what is left!), and ... get this ... only 39 years old.  

So I guess what I am trying to say is that people who go for ""hot"" are failing at the most basic level of **having standards**, so they are simply screwing themselves over.  Grow up, get some standards, and you'll be far happier (I know I am!)","1288576731"

We ended up exchanging our reddit IDs for the rally trophy thing without looking to carefully at the user names. I asked them were they were from. They said California and then I looked at the account name I was taking a picture of and realized that it was jedberg.

Turns out we had come across the reddit admins without even realizing it. We ended up walking around and talking with them for a bit. Very cool guys. They just acted like normal redditors. Without looking at their user names you never would have known. The only thing that identified them over any other redditor is that they were talking about about what they need to do on the site as far as maintenance type stuff goes. 

Other than that we talked about fairly normal (at least for the redditing world) stuff like cameras, Starcraft, gaming, what places we wanted to see while were were in DC, computer and the occasional meme here and there. 

The only time they said anything even remotely in an admin esq tone was when they said they really wanted people to be respectful and to clean up after themselves at they rally. They really wanted to make sure the rally was seen in a positive light. I am very happy to say that I feel like this was accomplished.

Other than that, the only other ""famous"" people I saw were the people on stage. Unfortantly I am terrible with names but some of the ones I remember were Jon stewart and Colbert of course, Ozy Ozbourne, Cat Stevens, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman as well as a bunch of others.","1288576742"

I agree that a futuristic setting can distance the audience, but I also think that an Alternate History creates much of the same distance.  In an Alternate History, much of your knowledge is thrown out the window anyways, so being a Jew doesn't have the same meaning there as here.  Alternate histories are usually the same up to a certain point, usually relatively recently, where some significant event occurred and society changed direction.  Essentially, those living in an alternate history will have roughly the same historical relationship to us as would interstellar colonists.  Still, I see your point, and they are not exactly the same.

I would definitely say whatever it was that the look should adhere to modern sci fi standards, that is, realistic looking environments that account for wear and tear and are based in some practical thinking, as well as costuming and general art design that is to a degree timeless, in the way of Firefly or BSG.  Cost is definitely an issue, but I suppose my thinking is just that I really want another political sci fi show.  Still, the sci fi element need not necessarily be spaceships.  Perhaps other technologies (Not AI) could add a bit of flavour.

I think for the society external to the principle nations you might also think about more basic needs.  Some people would gather together to grow food, maintain hospitals, provide education and just share resources.  Most likely, if the area is completely lawless, you would be dealing with a lot of Seven Samurai and Firefly type scenarios.  There would be a number of communities struggling to get by that would both welcome the rebels assistance against the bandits and greatly fear the government response were they to be found out.  These people would also need help getting supplies, conducting trade, etc.

I would tend to think the common people would have access mostly to the old organic drugs based on cost, but I could definitely see gang lords liking it.  Say it's a high class narcotic they import from the cities.  ","1288576780"

"programming","t5_2fwo","The 1 million figure was for Korea alone, which in the context of the smartphone market here is huge.  As for Japan, indeed statistics published last month show that the iphone does have [60.1% of the smartphone market](http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/10/28/report-iphone-commands-60-of-japans-smartphone-market-7-overall/)

*According to MMRI, a total of 2.23 million smartphones (Android/Windows Mobile/Blackberry/iOS/Palm) were sold in Japan between April and September this year, and 1.34 million (or 60.1%) of those were iPhones. This translates to 7% of the entire Japanese phone market, which is dominated by Sharp (22.7%) and Fujitsu (14.9%).*

&gt;so what is the excuse for the other device makers selling more than Apple ? i find it also interesting you cite Samsung having to ""give away devices to stay even"", yet when the iPhone is given away for free that's okay?

Not sure i follow your logic. Apple started with nothing in the Korean market last November and against all the confident predictions of the local pundits and pro-Samsung press wracked up huge sales figures trounching the Samsung Omnia, even though the iphone network is Korea Telecom and the Omnia is that of the leader SK Telecom. Samsung fought back with the Galaxy S, with a massive ad campaign that continues to this day, and gave away handsets to every Samsung employee + SK Telecom employee + free handsets with a 2-year contracts for the general market.  Apple has never given away the iphone here, and they remain much pricier than the Galaxy S.  

All in all, the iphone is an unprecedented hit in Japan and South Korea and is on its way to similar success in China.  Now if you want to cite India, you'd be on firmer ground, as for whatever reason, the iphone has flopped there.  But in the most sophisticated tech markets in Asia, the the iphone is a hit.

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","I'll echo the other sentiments that the most important part of any car is the tires.  I know you just bought some, but everything a car does has to be negotiated through those four little contact patches.  The difference in handling and braking is like night and day when you're comparing all-seasons and summer performance tires.  Tires like the Hankook RS3, Falken RT615K, or Dunlop Direzza Z1 Star Spec would be good places to start.  You can always tell how serious someone is about their car by the tires they have on it.  I'll always strike up a conversation with the kid driving a stock Mini on some old A048s rather than the ricer with a turbo Civic and all-season tires.

As far as brakes go, odds are you don't need to touch them.  If you want to improve your feel, though, stainless lines are never a bad call.  Somewhat expensive (usually over $100) but they are a great place to start refreshing the system.  For a mild daily driver, you'll probably be just fine with a house brand of ceramic pads, more for the noncaustic dust than anything else.  They overheat fast in a hard environment, but for a DD they're the way to go.","1288576842"

Favorite passage so far (Stewie journaling about Quagula):

&gt; Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body
has gone why may not another body go? I have seen him myself
crawl from his window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in
by his window? The chances are desperate, but my need is more
desperate still. I shall risk it. At the worst it can only be death;
and a man’s death is not a calf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may
still be open to me. God help me in my task! Good-bye, Brian, if
I fail; goodbye, my faithful friend and second father; good-bye,
all, and last of all Brian!

I took this between the second and third stop after we got on: http://i.imgur.com/wzbs2.jpg  They somehow got a few more people on at the subsequent stop, and then after that Metro employees acted as de facto gatekeepers until people started getting off the train downtown.  And all of that was a couple of hours before the rally actually began.  By 9:00 or so, there was already a line for the farecard machines at Dunn-Loring that stretched out beyond the parking lot and onto the bridge over the beltway.","1288576865"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","This week has been filled with small victories for me and they all seem to have come at once.

* I actually *feel* strong, powerful and agile; rather than just looking smaller, I actually feel it

* I picked a form fitting pair of jeans I liked, tried them on and they fitted and looked great. No more ""whats the biggest size you have?"" or having to aim for baggy jeans

* I've hit new records in my flat bench dumbbell press, dumbbell shoulder press and clean and press.

* I got invited to start training with my PT - not as a PT session but as a training partner since we are now at a similar strength and I maintain good form

* I was at a Halloween party where I knew only a couple of people and so spent the night talking to randoms. The first comment on separate occasions by two people there was ""you look like you work out a bit huh?"". Feels good man.

* That same night I was invited by (imo) the hottest chick at said party to go to the city with her and a few others and I ended up staying the night at her house - 12 months ago she would have been waaaaay out of my league, now she's the one asking me to go.

Theres a couple more but they're similar to the last 2 and this list is long enough already.

TL;DR: Things that have been slowly progressing since I started in the gym have started paying off all at once. This week I feel on top of the world.

I think I'm a nice guy. 

&gt; You're conflating agnosticism with atheism. Atheism is the (irrational) belief that God does not exist. Agnosticism is a lack of belief either way.

* Theist: A Belief in a god.
* Atheist: Non-Belief in a god.
* Gnostic: Certainty about something
* Agnostic: Uncertainty about something

&gt; Big Bang Theory

Huh? How does the Big Bang Theory prove that something outside of the natural order exists?

&gt; Argument from contingency

Really? Cosmological argument? And how do you know that the first cause is god? How do you know there is a first cause? How do you know the universe is not in an infinite loop between big bang and big crunch? How do you know so much about the universe? I prefer to be humble and admit I don't know where the universe came from instead of being arrogant and claiming to know all of the answers.

&gt; Actually there is one major dogma - the irrational article of faith that God does not exist.

Now, the last time I posted my ""ghost"" story, I got flamed and downvoted.  But, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Biology and work designing complex systems for a living.  I live in the world of fact.  However, when I was 15, I lived in a house where ""things"" happened to all the men in the house.  After moving out, I got the story from a concerned neighbor and the previous owner's ashes were buried at the end of the driveway.  

Of course I'm expecting most everyone here to call, ""bullshit"", but please hear me out.  Science is about that which can be observed, measured and repeated in controlled situations.  If we can't observe it, measure it, or repeat it in controlled situations, it can't be figured out by science.  It's that simple.

As we keep discovering new methods to measure and observe what we could not before, we take the unknown and bring it from the realm of hypothetical and into the that which the scientific method can discern.  

As to what ghosts are, or if they are, I have nothing more than guesses.  But, myself and my father lived through seeing nails flying across the room, seeing the wastebasket fly across the room and other entertaining bits of WTH.

**Total people used in study were not 50, even with the numbers you were supplied with**.

I'm in University too and guess what, we also do research and surveys. Big surprise!

**Never 50 persons, even with the numbers given**.

&gt; Therefore you can not say that "" religious conviction provides a framework for understanding and acting within one’s environment, thereby acting as a buffer against anxiety and minimizing the experience of error.""

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Sometimes, it's hard to tell the difference between ""something has gone wrong with the world"" and ""times are changing"".

Here are my responses to your points as I think of them:
Cases c) and f) can be generalized beyond genders.
Case d) calls upon a biological theory that does not govern modern social psychology; that's why there exist people who don't feel a need to protect women.
Case e) addresses (potential) reward, but I think we're more interested in consequence than reward.

Case b) only applies in more serious cases.  If a man decides to slap a woman in the face, her physical disadvantage is negligible - I'm fairly certain most healthy women will not suffer any injuries from these milder kinds of physical assault.
Case a) carries the same idea; if you agree that a woman's physical disadvantage is negligible in some cases (I encourage you to agree with this), then what exactly are the gender differences and needs requiring us to break equality? What exactly is the shape of the so-called square hole?


To ease your mind just a little bit, I assure you that I would never hit a woman unless under serious danger, because it's what I was taught, and it's what I believe.  I'm just willing to try and understand the reasoning behind the things I believe, and for me that involves looking at it from both angles.","1288576916"

"comics","t5_2qh0s","Here's another interpretation. If the beast forced the brother to assume each other's forms, and the brother took several days to revert to his old form, upon returning to the village the brother's actions could be explained as stemming from the suspicion that the beast has replace *the narrator*. After all, why would the narrator abandon his flesh and blood kin in the forest, then go home and make up a fake story about getting separated and killing the beast single handed? The brother can't look his alleged kin in the eye, and is digging a hole in preparation of killing what he thinks is the beast and burying its body.

The hole in the forest smelled like lilacs because the brother hunting the beast smelled like lilacs. The narrator goes back to the forest at the end out of guilt and finds the beast-as-his-brother corpse exactly where he left it, unreverted since it was dead.

But that's just another interpretation out of many. Obviously the author knows the answer to what actually happened (even if it is ""I never thought it through myself"" or ""I intended there to be multiple interpretations""), but she's deliberately left out enough information so that you can never know for certain you came to the same solution she had in mind.

Basically if you look at other historical documents from that time and era they were written exactly the same way.  The whole entire synoptic gospel was written with in 20-80 years after the events so there would still be eye witnesses.  Basically these writings are equivalent to a history book.  For example, you couldn't go around saying WWII didn't happen because we still have eye witnesses and tons of supporting evidence, it would never get off the ground.  In the same way if Christ was never resurrected then their writings would have never gotten off the ground and have such a huge explosion in belief.  Also all the apostles died for this belief and it might just be me but I don't think I would die for a lie. 
Also historical narrative fiction wasn't created until hundreds of years later (not sure the exact date).  So either this is true or they invented this writing style hundreds of years in advance. There is no reason they would add details in the Bible such as time if it were a fiction story.

Good going! 

At this point you have nothing to worry about. If dinner is going well tomorrow, mention the dance, see if she's interested.

Does your friend do well with girls this way? Some people like to ease into things but I think it just confuses the issue. If you like her as more than a friend then let her know that pretty much right away - not all needy, but let her know that you are interested in her as a woman, not a buddy.

&gt;Another friend said that since she never hit me up the past two days then it's a bad thing.

In the early stages, girls generally wait for the guy to make the moves. This is nothing to worry about.

&gt;11 churches in 8 years as a kid, I was like a ping-pong ball my dad battered around until he found some dogma that fit well enough that he never had to change.

Well I can understand how this kind of exposure could really warp your views of religion. My experience was one church for my entire life, full of very nice, caring, considerate people with very progressive and realistic attitudes. When I was older though I realized that the Bible doesn't really ever tell you that you have to go to church every Sunday, or many of the other things we were all taught. I began to understand that most 'religion' has nothing whatsoever to do with the core *tenants* of that religion, and that I cannot blame the words in a book for what other people later think of those words, *especially* when their actions are unsupported by the words.

&gt;the only justification that has ever made sense to me is that we (as a country) are protecting ourselves from an outside force.

If you will observe that religions are nominally made up of like-minded persons who might consider them a diasporean nation of individuals, like the Jewish people do, then you can begin to understand how its adherents have, at times, had identical thoughts as you have, that as a people, they were protecting themselves from an outside force. It's not an acceptable excuse for violence, hatred, war, or genocide, or any negative emotions, but it was just as real to *them* as the falsity (in *my* opinion) of the country and the threats to it is to you. The root causes are indistinguishable save the label applied.

As for me, I am a pacifist in the sense that violence is only acceptable as a response to violence, and violence must never, ever be initiated. Thus I cannot justify torture of anyone, at any time, because it is the infliction of violence against another person. Nothing about me allows me to judge the righteousness of harming another person. Sure, I'm kind of an asshole and am really crass at times and dismissive of other who I disagree with, my post history bears that out. But no matter how forcefully I reject their opinions and even personality, I could *never* justify harming them over our disagreements, unless I were previously physically attacked, and even then the only possible response is against my explicit attackers, not just blanketly anyone associated with them somehow. 

&gt;The problem is that the ""enemy"" actually exists.

I disagree. The only enemy mankind faces is in his own heart, his own fears, angers, desires, hatreds, and all the other empty, negative emotions that humans create. You can't fix what is inside you that makes you fear your common man by torturing someone or bombing their lands. Those actions will *never* resolve the source of your concerns. 

&gt;If we let them, they will burn us to the ground like so many more dissenters left to rot in a field with a bullet in the spine.

And yet no Chinese person I have ever met has been any threat to me. The PRC is only as strong as those who *choose* to serve it, and their service *is* a choice. Perhaps you or they don't feel it is a choice, due to their own fears for their physical body, but I recognize that every person chooses their actions every moment of every day. I don't fear invasion by the Chinese because I know that my countrymen do not fear invasion by the Chinese, and that we would fight them just as aggressively as the Afghani fight all intruders to *their* lands. I simply do not let these negative emotions consume me and so government *or religious* propaganda does not sway me. 

&gt;that people have certain inalienable rights, that all were created equal. 

But we *do* have inalienable rights, and we *were* born with equal rights (though not ""as equals"" - that one of us can be shorter or taller than the other alone bears that out). It is not up to another to give us these rights, and no government can grant them. You can harm my body all you want, but you *cannot* remove from me my rights, you can only refuse to acknowledge them.

&gt;I met one woman who traveled to India and was so god-damn horribly shocked at the conditions some of the population lives in

Yet you do not blame Hinduism with its caste systems for this, at this point in your argument? What is specific to Christianity or Islam in their guilt for equivalent results except that you feel reason to fear them and not this other? It is, getting back to my previous arguments, because you fear the *power* they represent, and not the beliefs or teachings. If Christianity was a forgotten story known by only a handful of obscure, ignored adherents, you wouldn't be ascribing all these terrible things to it, yet it would remain the same tool as it is in this reality.

&gt;But in my mind, the enemy is the government like the PRC that shits on and kills it populace as easily as we make an order at McDonalds.

And in *my* mind, the enemy is inside us, in the place where we believe we can blame abstract things like ""government"" and ""religion"", which do not ever take any real, physical form, but only the form of those who *believe in and promote* these abstractions, instead of those who willingly choose to engage in harm. 

&gt;it is one hundred times harder to stop the harm in a country where every male citizen literally believes to his fucking bones that man is greater than woman, that women cannot learn/vote/have rights than it is to topple a government (Like the PRC or like Nazi germany) that doesn't have religion to prop it up.

Yet this describes America one hundred years ago. How greatly we've changed, despite having two widespread religious revivals in that time, and *the engagement of the clergy with civil rights activities!* If we were constantly assailed by an outside force during the last hundred years that blamed our sets of beliefs for these issues and not the choices of individuals, we would have clung even tighter to them. It is human nature, shown again and again, that trying to force a new opinion on a person simply *reinforces* the old one. Is it no wonder that Islam today has become so fundamentalist, as the United States has spent the past fifty years alternatively supporting Saudi Arabia, the birth of Wahhabism, while attacking Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, the *historical homeplaces of moderate Islam*? The more we brutalize their people, the stronger their people resist, just the same as if China were to invade *us*, we would fight them for every inch of soil, *even if their promises were to free us from an oppressive government!* 

&gt;Religion, it aint doing anyone no good, man.

Tell that to the woman who loses her baby, the man searching for a reason to stop drinking, or the elderly person who literally has no one and nothing else. Religion has helped and saved far more people than it has harmed, or else it *wouldn't* have the attraction that it has for so much of the population. 

&gt;But I'm not an Anarchist.

While I am an anarchist, because I recognize that no matter what tools are used against me, no one has sovereignty over me but God, and God doesn't really interfere with the lives of man anymore, if He ever did. I will do my best to judge and harm no person, and will resist all judgement and harm inflicted on me, no matter what the source or justification claimed, whether religion or government. Wrong things are wrong, and even absent any God, that would still be true. No words can change wrong to right, or right to wrong. ","1288576983"

Now, they may be able to find out who those employees are when they subpoena all the records in the case they are bringing against the company. Even then, they may or may not charge those individuals.

Believe me, I get raging pissed-off about this shit too. But there is the idea of justice, and there is reality. The AG just knows the way to hurt them is in the wallet. What you're talking about is hard to do, and in the end, yields little results. If they are able to I.D. the individuals, they will most likely use them to testify against the company.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Me not treating an internet forum like an academic paper says nothing.

If your consider politely linking a source to be akin to writing an academic paper, I don't want to read your papers...

&gt;I never said such a thing.

But allsecretsknown did - which is why I took issue. I agree that it is *usually* so...

&gt;Do you think woman should be allowed to speak in a church or go around without their hair covered? Or that it is acceptable for a man to wear long hair? If so, you are quite used to interpreting the Bible in a specific social context.

Well, I don't believe in a God.  I simply read the Bible as it is written.  The language is pretty clear in certain cases of what God considers to be expected of his followers.  If you take issue with those things I wager that you don't believe in the God depicted in the Bible...

&gt;First, we are talking Romans, not Greeks. 

The OT predates the Roman Empire by quite a lot. Hellenistic Greece coincides with estimates of when it was written.

&gt;Second, the Greeks would've considered a non-adolescent male in a submissive homosexual relationship to be humiliated.

Not humiliated per se, it would depend. It would simply mean that the penetrated partner would be in the feminine (submissive) position. It was usually assumed by those of a lesser social status - but not always. Never speak in absolutes. For example, Alexander the Great is believed to have had a relationship with Hephaestion, a lifelong friend.  

Anyways, this is beside the point.  The Bible says the *ACT* of homosexual sex is a crime against nature (abomination) and sinful in God's eye. It does not need a social context because God's view of right and wrong is unchanging according to scripture. Crimes against nature are always crimes against nature.","1288577016"

Short and stupid story. When HDR first started ""catching on"" I decided to experiment with one or two of my photos. I thought the result was decent, but not majorly impressive. It ""saved"" a photo that would have otherwise been impossible, but I did it badly and I overdid it. I put that picture into a book of my photos that I made for a ""secret santa"" type thing that my family does. Problem is, that photo, that photo that I really didn't think was anything special at all, got ALL of the attention. My other stuff, the stuff that I actually cared about, was overshadowed by a stupid experiment.

I don't know if it's the colors, the tone, or the ""fake"" detail that comes out when you really overdo HDR, but the layperson LOVES it. Doesn't matter if they appreciate photography or not when you can make everything look like a painting or a video game.

Since then, I've used the process sparingly and in the future I'll probably attempt some manual HDR because it IS a great tool, but it should be used properly.","1288577038"

This God is also not a God in the traditional view of the word because God is understood as being a ""substance"", and not a being. 

In respect to advocating materialism and using reductionism as a method of destroying the necessity of the idea of a God. I don't really think learning about different way to view to universe really solves those questions that can't be answered. It seems to me that you ascribe to scientism. To claim that your beliefs are all purely scientific fact is to say that you are living a life with no meaning. But there is a undoubtedly meaning in your life.

You are confusing [Al Qaeda in Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Queda_in_Iraq), which didn't exist in Iraq until after 9/11, yet was blamed by the Bush administration and used as an excuse to go after Saddam Hussein.

Al Qaeda didn't exist in Iraq until later in 2003, well after the [""Axis of evil""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil) statement by Bush, used in January 2002.

&gt; We're supporting a country to help secede from itself?

We do that a lot and it's been part of our foreign policy since at least WWII. Ask Communist China, Vietnam, and South Korea about how we helped them during their periods of civil war. For more recent events, take a look towards South America and eastern Europe.

&gt; But you DON'T give me money to countries involved in something you don't agree with.

If that were true then we wouldn't be handing money out to anyone. Money is just a tool of foreign policy used as a means to gain influence. ""Hey, we'd like you to stop doing X, here's a bucket of money."" We just sent Pakistan $300 million to ""secure"" their nuclear arms. The U.S. has vested interests in spending money overseas both as a means to get things done (in its own self-interest often times), as well as to build credibility in the international community as ""helpers"" instead of being the big guy on the block dictating state policy.

&gt; We shouldn't give a company that hires child laborers money...

No, we shouldn't, but sometimes it's even worse to point fingers and then say ""... but we're not going to help you improve.""

For example, go tell someone who is obese ""hey, you should really start eating healthier."" It's probably not going to be very effective. But if you instead say ""hey, you should really start eating healthier and here's some cash to get you started,"" that looks a lot better and is much more likely to actually accomplish something, no matter how small the improvement.","1288577074"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","As the designer of the UW-Milwaukee kit, I want to weigh in a little...

I'm pretty sure that we're the only school in the contest that can't use the school logo on our kits. The school administration wants us to pay a licensing fee to use it, despite the fact that we're a sanctioned club. Heck, if I remember things correctly, we really aren't even allowed to call ourselves the UW-Milwaukee Cycling Team, as we're not looked at as a team by the school, but rather a student club.

So, with that in mind, I decided to throw everything out the window and be as obnoxious as possible. If the school doesn't want to take us seriously I'm not going to take representing them seriously either. 

Aside from that, I think a lot of people take cycling way too seriously in general. I spend my summers working very closely with bike racers of all levels and it drives me nuts how serious some of them take this sport. I have a good number of friends that are actual professional riders that earn a real paycheck for racing their bikes, including a few ProTour riders, and while they all take their profession seriously they're made to look like slackers by the average cat 4.

And it's those cat 4s that cemented my decision to submit that well, awesome, kit to the club, force it through the ""vote"", and submit it to the King of Style competition.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I went for 5+ years on the withdrawal (pull-out) method, no baby scares.  Only had a pregnancy when we actively decided to get pregnant.

When done right, it just as effective as condoms.  When done right, that's the kicker.  It's up to you to be able to do it consistently and correctly.  The first step is to know when you start ejaculating.  Don't just assume that it's at the height of orgasm.  Know exactly when it starts coming out, and make sure you are not inside of her when that happens.  When you are masturbating, pay careful attention to when your ejaculation starts - take note of the sensation and commit that time period to memory.

Also, you'll need to make sure you get out of there in time.  When you are close to orgasm, make sure that you are in a position that allows for easy withdrawal.  And don't think ""one extra pump"", this is where a lot of guys fail.

Many people recommend kegel exercises for improving stamina - rather than stamina, I found that it gave me the ability to delay ejaculation upon orgasm for 3-4 seconds.  Not a whole lot of time, but for your pull-out needs, this is more than enough to get out and get clear.  So I highly recommend doing kegels.  A good practice technique is to try stopping and restarting your urine stream.  

Also, you'll want to get to know her cycles - you want to be careful anyway, but around her fertile periods exercise extra care.  

A lot of ballyhoo was made about precum, but recent studies have shown that precum itself has little to no sperm content.  Where it can get you is if you have leftover sperm in your urethra from a previous ejaculation - so if you are going for round two, or a morning romp after a night session, this could make precum more of a concern.  If you have urinated since your last ejaculation though, you'll be fine, as the acidity kills the sperm.  For a second romp, I usually would go physically clean myself off, or have my girlfriend give me a BJ to help clear the system, so to speak.

My first girlfriend told me she didn't like condoms and wouldn't have as much sex with me if I insisted on using them.  I was young and dumb so I agreed to go bare, but the smarter parts of me decided to research it and do it right.  I went for 2 with her with no problems, broke up, got a new girlfriend, and went for 5 years with her until we got married and decided to (successfully) have a child.  So, it is most definitely do-able.  In a lot of ways, I now feel like - why do you want to put all your trust in a thin piece of latex?  I'd much rather have control over the process myself.  

As practice, I would recommend ejaculating into a tissue when masturbating.  Don't be holding the tissue as you fap - have it somewhere nearby but still in a location where you actually have to reach for it and grab one or two.  If you can get all of your ejaculate into that tissue, then you're off to a good start.","1288577102"

You're adding a lot of nuance if you think that he doesn't mean for ""showdown"" to mean war, but rather threatening war to the point of Iran giving in and destroying their nuclear capabilities (I doubt that is even a realistic goal).  

Sure he says ""may be regarded"" instead of ""will be regarded"" in his last sentence, but that's because after so many statements like ""this will help him politically"" and ""the economy will improve"", I guess he decided to tone it down a little.  If he's uncertain of that last statement, why is he so sure about the other ones?

Im being a complete ass, or acting stupid and annoying.. i deserve a whack up the head. Thats fair, and its never serious (well 99% of the time it isnt)

There have been a few isolated incidents where it was serious and i didnt deserve it. Alcohol is always to blame in this scenario. Theres nothing worse than being blind-sided by a punch, or have a mass of claws going for your eyes. Luckily my friends all know the situation when it gets like that and ive gotten good at dodging when i see it coming. However if i need to be a bit more forceful (not hitting, but tripping her and sitting her down on the sidewalk) people are generally alright with it. The key is not to get overly aggressive. Once we sit down its the ritual of keeping her calm and not letting her try to bite the next person that walks by.

Always fun to laugh about afterwards though. I still love the time we both got far too drunk in town. She tried to pick a fight with people outside a noodle shop. I sat her down, got her out to my friends house(this was an amazing feat because i didnt speak the language or know where he lived exactly), and then i proceeded to be violently ill in the toilet.

http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/dz6qe/his_face_all_red/c1416tz

Based on the evidence collected (including author response), we can conclude that the monster was indeed a doppelganger, not the wolf.  The question that remains is whether the one in the hole, or the one in the village is the doppelganger.  The author is unwilling to say, and indeed it's possible she herself doesn't know.

Though, based on the fact that we now know it is a doppelganger, the best conclusion that I can draw is the following:

The doppelganger operates/lives in a hole.  It gave off the smell of lilacs to draw in a victim, or because it had already taken the shape of the brother, who we know grows lilacs, possibly has their scent on him.  Our protagonist shoots his brother, and throws him into the hole.  The doppelganger shows up in the village a few days later.  The protagonist ventures out into the forest and finds his brothers' body.  While the doppelganger has stolen his form, his soul cannot rest, or something along those lines.   

Back in the village, the doppelganger, being a beast and possessing no true intellect of its own, has begun to dig another hole to continue its life-cycle. 

edit: http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/dz6qe/his_face_all_red/c141m1n is also possible.  The monster in the hole is indeed the doppelganger, and the brother in the village just plans on murdering the protagonist for the lulz. ","1288577137"

"Health","t5_2qh9z","Moving from high meat intake to low meat intake diets have been shown to be very beneficial.[1] That study specifically finds a reduction of about 50g of meat per day giving a decreased risk of mortality from heart disease in a 10 year period of almost 30%.

A very good study is [2], it does a meta-analysis of the five biggest studies of vegetarian vs. meat eaters, and finds an increase in life expectancy of 5% on average, after controlling for lifestyle and nutritional factors. [3] found similar results.

While back home, I had cable that I paid $10 a month. Then I requested internet, they said it's $5 extra. When I asked for the DVR, they gave it to me. They also gave me the internet modem. Guess how much am I paying for all of it total? $15.","1288577203"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","There's plenty of abuse of the system and failed initiatives but to claim that the majority of people abuse the system is probably false for most programs. My thoughts on it are if I ever lose my job I'd be able to get unemployment, even if I have yet to. If I lose my job, I get to keep my insurance now when before if I lost my job and got sick I get the double 'fuck you' from life of having no income and then needing to spend money. Life isn't fair, yes, but to have a government who just takes that stance and shrugs their shoulders makes it worse. 

As for taxes, a flat tax with no deductions possible, just everyone pays 20% (Just a random number I pulled out of no where) would be fine with me but there would need to be serious penalties from fraud and a bunch of loopholes closed. The problem with the current tax code is that it's hard to know how much you actually owe and it's easy for the rich to find loopholes out of it. It creates a system so porous that [Google only payed a 2.4% rate.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html) That seriously needs to be reformed and if a flat tax would remedy this I'd support it.

However, a consumption tax I think is a nightmarish proposal. You'd essentially be shifting the tax burden even more on the middle class and poor just by percentage of spending. If you are spending paycheck to paycheck and there is a consumption tax of say, 20% for this example, then almost 20% of all the money you make is going to the government. If you make a large amount of money and then only spend a small amount of it then by percentage you are barely paying anything compared to what you are making. So instead of a flat tax proposal where you'd end up paying 20% no matter what you end up with the poor paying close to that 20% and the rich pay 5% or less. That's no way to fund a government or allow upward mobility. You'd make the wealth gap, which is the worst it's been in decades currently, even worse. ","1288577204"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","For all those calling her shallow for wanting the ring:

The ring might not have been what she wanted, the symbolism of GIVING her the ring is most likely what she is referring to.  Contrary to popular belief, women are often (not always, but often), not interested in material objects for material objects sake, they are interested in symbols.  Giving her the ring was a symbol of some kind (I'm not sure what from the OP's post), and that was what she wanted.  Its the same reason engagement rings are so often asked for, not because they want some material object, but because of the symbolism that that object represents (specifically the financial investment that the man is willing to make to be with her).

Don't get me wrong, I think it is overdone, and there are much better ways and means to symbolize devotion or love than a ring that costs 2 months salary, or really any material object without something more personal than money sunk into it, but don't go screaming ""she is so shallow"" because you think she wants the *ring*.

Take an entire head of garlic, drizzle olive oil on it, wrap it in aluminum foil and bake it in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes.  When cool, cut off the end and squeeze out the garlic (it will be mushy).

Cut up a parsnip into thin slices; cut the turnip the same way, dice up about two potatoes.  Boil until it's all soft, drain and let cool.

Press it through a potato ricer (this is crucial to getting a very smooth consistency).  Add the garlic, a brick of cream cheese, butter, salt and pepper.  Mix with a hand mixer until very smooth.  Put in ramekins and bake for about ten minutes.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Lesser of two evils my friend.  If we didn't send the aid the country would probably destabilize (I know, it's already pretty bad right now; but things could always get worse).  I am sure that the President has a lot more info than we do on stuff like this. 

Would you rather have the struggling government be taken over by rebels that are way worse?  Because it's already pretty much the social norm to have 'child soldiers' over there.  Hard to believe cultures are different from ours, am I right?  

Yeah it's wrong, yeah it would be easier to cut off everything and ignore them.  Keep in mind you're also dealing with people who refuse to use birth control because it makes them 'less of a man.'  And a whole bunch of other customs I'm sure I don't understand either.

The least we can do is try to offer some kind of stability to the region by keeping the current government in place.  Because you know, their leaders tend to get overthrown every other year.  Maybe if we give a little aid and stabilize things, we can work on your issues with their child soldiers down the road.  Because this is how diplomacy and dealing with other countries works when they are as screwed up as they are.  It is far better to keep a long leash on their current leadership than to have no leash at all and let things go all wacky like usual over in Africa.

Because, seriously, the easy thing to do is yell ""CHILD SOLDIERS ARE BAD AND WRONG!!""  The hard part is figuring out how to stop it and I don't see you offering and suggestions or insight.  And no, I don't think asking them to stop is going to work.  I don't even think educating them is going to work because they would probably rape and enslave anyone that goes over there (Which has happened to aid workers before).

See the US has a lot of money.  And when you think about it, our budget is pretty much gambling.  You have a lot of things you can bet on, and not all of the projects are going to work out and be a win.  So you have to play the field.  The more you spread the money around, the more of a chance you have of having a win.  Sort of like not putting all of your eggs in the same basket.  This is why our country seems to spend money on stupid things.  But you know, what if, for a mere investment of a couple of million dollars, what if something did happen for the better?  It's improbable, but not impossible.  

This is what is going on (I think).  We are just playing the field and using America's vast wealth to try to get a win for our best interests.  And it is in our best interest to not have Africa all fucked up.  Stability in the region would mean we could bring them the 'American Dream' of McDonalds and The Gap.  America's best interests include businesses and bringing American owned businesses to other parts of the world.  Now I know that corporations make way too much.  That should be fixed.  They should be taxed like they were 100 years ago (a lot).  This money that is being sent over there is seen as a gamble and an investment at the same time.  Sort of like putting your retirement into a mutual fund.  This is America's mutual fund. The money is fucking everywhere.","1288577309"

My only thought as to how it might make sense to call those plays interceptions is that it has something to do with the stupid new rule about receivers maintaining control all the way through when they go to the ground.  And announcers keep saying the receiver has to do some ""second act"", whatever the hell that means.

Don't ask me to answer your question and then take out historical context. There is no benefit to spending energy and structure without gain. In this case the R. Laryngeal nerve is coursing a path that could be done shorter and more direct (no I'm not talking about one end organ). 13ft of extra giraffe nerve is a waste and would not be designed. There is not a gain, unless one then backs up and says ""embryogenesis is perfect"", but that's flawed too because a perfect design wouldn't result in downstream waste. If there was a design, this would already be accounted for. God is perfect and could already see the result. 

No it won't branch earlier. It probably never will. That's not how evolution works. The nerve is where it is due to a common ancestor that didn't take an expensive path. As other features (neck, centralizations of nerves to our head) became more liekly to result in offspring the nerve got elongated in the same common (and altered) embryological process. It costs less to keep the costly elongated nerve than whatever gain had by other physical features needed to take place. There isn't a net gain or loss at this point for the nerve to alter offspring. We have enough food to create the nerve as is, fuck, create offspring with the nerve, and on and on and on. 
There is no end point of evolution. We aren't TRYING to get to some point. We aren't TRYING to get 6 fingers and are only at 5. 

Again, a perfect design would begin with embryological rules that didn't require downstream inefficiency.

But it is a rare mistep by the coen brothers - it lacks the deftness and light of touch that the original has and the story needs and as for Tom Hanks, his performance was nowhere near the calibre of Alec Guinness' in the original.

You are assuming that people are unable to separate their private views from their public obligations, but that is an assumption. You can look to John Kennedy's record to see if his Catholicism interfered in his politics, or if Harper's Catholicism undermines his politics.  
  
you asked why some labelled rob ford a homophobe, and i gave you my opinion of why, all that block of text may well be true, but it has nothing to do with the question.

Drinking alcohol in moderation isn't bad, and there are certain pleasures associated with it that I struggle to see how they are morally reprehensible, such as sharing a glass of good wine over dinner with your wife. The gambling aspect you act as if it was extremely common when there are hardly people that I know that have done it as a hobby, other than buying a lottery ticket every once in a while.

And of course Islam has a huge tribal aspect, how can you not know this? Even among ""fellow"" Muslim tribes, people are killed routinely for meddling with the ""wrong"" tribes. Not to mention honor killings due to daughters or wifes refusing to follow what the father, sorry, the ""family"" wants.

Also, LOL at Muslims not judging people by the color of their skins. Arabs are about the most racist people ever, since they are Mohammeds chosen people and all. Sorry if that interferes with your MLK quote but yeah that's the reality, ask any south asian that has lived there.

&gt;For example, Alexander the Great is believed to have had a relationship with Hephaestion, a lifelong friend.

And was ridiculed for it.

&gt; It does not need a social context because God's view of right and wrong is unchanging according to scripture.

I don't think that scripture says any such thing (that the specific ways that God wishes certain individuals to behave in certain times and in certain places are universal to all people at all times). In fact, I would argue that Scripture says the exact opposite.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Intuition is about knowing what the result should be without going through the full steps of the solution. As mian2zi3 said, developing intuition in a particular area requires solving many problems in that area.

For example, what should `[;\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} {\sqrt{n^{2} +n} -n};]` be? Well, if `[; n ;]` is very large, then `[; n^{2} +n ;]` is approximately `[; n^{2} ;]`, so `[; \sqrt{n^{2} +n} ;]` is approximately `[; \sqrt{n^{2}}=n ;]`, and `[; \sqrt{n^{2} +n} -n ;]`  is approximately `[; n-n=0 ;]`. So we expect our desired limit to be 0.

This is certainly not a rigorous proof of the value of the limit, but if we know what the limit should be, it can give us ideas about how to proceed with the proof.","1288577425"

Josh McDaniels isn't getting fired until after the 2011 season (assuming there is one). Bowlen has to pay Shanahan through the 2011 season, and McDaniels through 2012. No way he pays 3 HCs next year.

Turner should've been fired years ago. Not that I'm complaining, since watching Norv try to coach is always good for laughs.

I doubt Phillips gets fired before the end of the season. Jerry Jones doesn't seem to believe in firing HCs mid-season.

I think Singletary saved his job through the end of the season as well. But I wouldn't be surprised to see him gone after the season.

Fox's contract is up at the end of the season. No reason to fire him in mid-season; this year is gone already for the Panthers.

Mangini has actually done fairly well with that Browns team. Yes, they're 2-5, but they beat the Saints handily, and there've been some good revelations in players. That defense is actually fairly good. They're not going to compete this year or next, but I don't know if Holmgren will see a reason to make a change.

Greetings, Anonymous!

The Lulz Liberation Front would like to extend a cordial invitation to all of you to join a raid on the DUG east web site this Tuesday at 12:30PM. 

What's DUG East and why should anybody bother raiding them? DUG (Developing Unconventional Gas) East is a three-day conference of energy companies in Pittsburgh. Its purpose is to promote hydrofracking, a method of extracting natural gas from shale that generates millions of gallons of highly toxic waste water. Hydrofracking threatens to poison water supplies across New York and Pennsylvania. Disgusting details can be found at http://shaleshock.org. The conference is sponsored by Halliburton, among others, and their lunchtime speaker is none other than everybody's favorite Turdblossom, Karl Rove.

WTF is a Lulz Liberation Front?  We're anarchists who hate hydrofracking and love teh lulz. We aim to shut down the DUG East web site for the duration of the conference.

What's this really going to accomplish? It will accomplish lulz. EPIC lulz.

What do? The usual. Get the LOIC, point it at dugeast.com (65.71.36.135), at 12:30 PM EST Tuesday FIRE ALL LAZERS!!! Newfag instructions and more at http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dzaiv/instructions_for_raid/

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sry no I don't put the senile in with that. I should have clarified. My apologies. So to clarify my statement. I have met plenty of dumbass people who are 60,70,80 that were not senile. Or mentally handicapped.

I don't like how our society portrays the mentally handicapped or those that have mental deficiencies. I am talking about people who would not be rated as such being dumbasses. Lets say with an IQ of 80-110 or so, and yes you can have a decently high IQ and still be a dumbass. IQ = how much you know and your ability to recall it as fast as possible. Think of it like a hard drive. If the hard drive is heavily fragmented and the response times and recall data is less then the IQ would be less than one that is less fragmented. 

So again I will reiterate my point. None of what I said relates to any one of any mental deficiency. Not saying some of the tea partiers aren't mentally handicapped in some way but a lot of them are pretty much in the normal range mentally. However, do I really need to add the label dumbass? ""I am against socialism - Take your government hands off of my social security""

Edit - I would like to add that younger or older people meeting up in a short amount of time doesn't make some one a dumbass. Well it depends on how short if you are saying 5 seconds to an hour or so? Sure. But a day or week? No. If you are of average intelligence or a little above and can read people fairly well. You can get to know some one fairly easily in that short period of time. Also you can be smart about it as well. Like meeting some one for the first time I suggest doing so in a crowded place or some where in public and stay at that public place until you are more than comfortable with them. If not then you can just leave. If you are then good. That provides a good safe buffer. Also females I would suggest if you meet some one new in a short or hell long amount of time. Maybe bring a male friend along or brother or some one you trust. If they really love or care about you they shouldn't have a problem with you protecting your safety. If you feel uncomfortable and want to back out of it you should be able to and the other person should be understanding of that and you shouldn't feel bad about it. ","1288577479"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Oh oh oh!  Good Question!  This gets into the difference between a priori arguments and a posteriori arguments.

A priori arguments are arguments which we know to be true based on the definitions of the terms used.  ""Two plus two equals four"" is a good example.  There is no evidence that lead us to that conclusion; rather, the definitions necessitate the answer.  Like ""All bachelors are single.""

A posteriori arguments are based on observation and inductive reasoning. ""Some bachelors are happy."" is an aposteriori statement.  We can only learn whether bachelors are happy by seeing and observing.

The argument ""God exists because he has the characteristic of always existing."" is an a priori argument.  That is, a theist has simply defined god as an answer to the question that he posed.

An athiest can make the same fallacious argument by defining matter to simply exist.  ""Matter has the characteristic of always existing.""  Notice this get us no closer to understanding whether that is true or not.  We have simply defined god or matter as an answer to the question posed.

My argument:  ""There never was nothing"" is a posteriori. It is based on the observation that we have never witnessed matter being created nor destroyed. If such evidence were presented that matter and energy can be created or destroyed, then I would have to reevaluate my argument.

The theist can make the same a posteriori argument for god; however, we can see that it is flimsy.  The theist would have to argue that we know god is always existing because the bible tells us so.  Most atheists would reject this as no evidence at all.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It's wrong to exclude others from the possibility of marriage due to their religion? What should you base your marriage on, if not your religion, culture, and common interests? Religion and faith are a HUGE part of people's lives and it's difficult to have a solid, lasting marriage if you are not on the same page when it comes to morals, values, raising children, etc. 

My point is not that people should only marry within their religion. My point is that if people choose to be a member of their religion, they should not be judged for marrying within. 

Many faiths strongly encourage marrying only from within, including LDS (Mormon), Judaism, Baha'i, Jehovah's Witnesses, and many Christian denominations. Full disclosure: I'm Catholic. If I brought home a non-Catholic (and for the matter, non-Irish) boy, my parents would be fine, but my grandma (who helped raise me) would be concerned. Not because the guy was not good enough, but she would worry if we would have a lasting marriage. The (tiny!) differences between Protestants and Catholics still make a difference, especially when it comes to raising kiddos. Personally, I will be marrying an Irish-Catholic because I chose to, not because I'm excluding others. I would hope that, not matter what religion you are and marry within, you are healthy and happy.

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","Ah, use-mention error.  Cold logic.  Logic doesn't work when it comes to emotion.

You see, I had a black friend in the army and we called ourselves nigger regularly because we felt were being treated like a nigger.  Made to do the shitty jobs, looked down and thought poorly of because of our rather ignorant and poor NCO.  One time I thought it was my buddy standing there and I said, ""Put a nigger behind the trigger,"" meaning that here we go with another shitty job.  

It wasn't my friend.  It was someone else altogether.

And there I stood, a 27 year old man, crying like a baby saying how sorry I was because I didn't want him to think I was racist.  Why?  Because no matter how much reappropriation, how much you and your friends call each other names like faggot and nigger and what have you, you can never fully escape what that word has done.

Nigger is the word Klansmen use right before they lynch or beat a black man.  Faggot is the last word a gay man hears before he goes unconscious from the beating.  No ammount of ""oh no, I don't mean like you are a nigger,"" will never fully disarm what the word has come to mean.  Emotions are always tied behind words.  You can't coldly detach words from thoughts and ideas, no more than you can detach your head from your body and live.

So when you call that guy that cut you off in traffic a faggot, you still have the seeds of anger, hate, and disgust that the homophobe does when he is beating that transgendered woman to death.  It's not the same blind hate, not the same loathing that causes you to physically harm, but the seeds are there.  Faggot, Nigger, Cunt, Kike, Dune Coon, or what have you, no matter how much you wish to pretend that it's cool because they are your friend, or ""not mean it that way,"" it still carries the impact in some small way that it is meant by the person who uses it in such a hateful way to fuel their rage.

No amount of approaching it from cold logic will ever take away the impact of what those words mean down on their fundamental level.  A demeaning, condescending, belittling and dehumanizing way.  To look at it from a pure logic viewpoint is to refuse to recognize that words are made by people.  People who are emotionally driven, and aware even on sub-conscious levels of what they are saying has at some point been used to harm someone.","1288577540"

In my experience:

1.  Distance makes relationships nearly impossible in all but the best situations.

3.  She is now giving you ""red flags"" and making you miserable because you are supposed to ""man up"" and break up with her.  If you do not, she will do EVERYTHING in her power to make you miserable until you do, up to and including screwing another guy.

4.  Counseling is for couples who are together and having problems.  

You need to read the book ""The Way of the Superior Man"" by D. Dueda, and the book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" by Dr. Glover.  Either learn and grow from this experience, or suffer until you do.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This really great formulas that exist which try hard to simulate randomness.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator

many are complex, but for a beginner, try this:

x = (x + y) mod z

x is the result, z is the number of numbers to choose from (like z would be 10 is you wanted any number 0-9).  all numbers are integers, and y is just a number that you pick, which you find to produce pretty random results.

keep in mind that there are very few reasons to use such a formula.  The one ive found is for programming embedded microcontrollers. 

Most environments have a library for that kind of thing.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Your second point might actually make a lot of sense. A lot of games do feel like they were designed by people who were following a sort of manual of formulaic game design, where everything is streamlined and everything is convenient and everything has a nice calculated risk/reward ratio. Find the NPC who gives a quest, do it, get rewarded. Find the dungeon, do it, get rewarded. Everything ends up making a certain sort of ""game-sense."" More thing seem systematic now. More things seem carefully calculated and made to fit in with some overarching theme of balance and engineered ""gaming fun."" 
  
Maybe some older games were developed to be something more than just games. I feel like older MMOs and RPGs were about big worlds that players could go into, big worlds that happened to be games. Some of the newer RPGs feel like games that just happen to be about big worlds. I'm really bad at articulating this sort of stuff (because I am not a student of game design nor am I an experienced critic of games).   
  
I mean, look at Morrowind. It had horrible quest directions, it was easy to get lost, travel was inconvenient and slow, there were ""too many skills,"" a lot of things were useless -- but I say I had a lot more fun playing that beautiful mess of a game than I did playing the much ""nicer"" Oblivion.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Dear Friends of Hawaii,

For many months now, Hawaii has been going through a financial crisis like the rest of the Mainland US. On Hawaii's News Channels and in the Newspaper we read and hear about Hawaii's homeless, affordable housing shortage, job loss, a new law saying that the homeless cannot sleep on the side-walks, but where will they go?  We also hear about many other social issues facing Hawaii's future and Waikiki.

You might be interested in learning more about this world-changing project to help humanity in Hawaii. HDSC will provide 300 jobs, 1,000 construction jobs plus over 1,000 business start-ups and entrepreneurial program start-ups and help thousands of people in need per month in Hawaii. We expect to be self sufficient and not take tax payers money through state funding &amp;amp; city &amp;amp; county funding by becoming self-sufficient.

Today, Hawaii is in a crisis with many problems - The Hawaiian Islands have approximately 26,000 to 28,000 homeless with 10,000 homeless alone on the Island of Oahu. Hawaii also has a population of over 4,000 to 6,000 men and women that are incarcerated. Due to the high costs and prison overcrowding, approximately 2,000 of Hawaii's imprisoned men have been moved to Arizona. Also, there are nearly 8,000 to 10,000 men and women that are on probation and approximately 4,000 children whose parents are in prison. Studies show that 90% of these youth will end up in prison like their parents. This is a whole new crime wave getting ready to hit Oahu &amp;amp; Waikiki.

Hawaii has 100 active gangs that have an overall total of 4,000 to 6,000 gang members (gang markings are in almost every community in Hawaii with graffiti &amp;amp; shoes hanging from telephone wires). Every month, one woman dies due to ""Domestic Violence"" and at least one person commits suicide. Hawaii is rated 5th in the US for the drug use of Methamphetamine, also simply known as Meth. Hawaii was once #1 for Meth use. We have 300,000 to 500,000 youth and adults in Human Trafficking in Hawaii and the US Mainland. Oahu has over 900,000 911 calls a year.

What is the answer to these problems? We believe that the Hawaii Dream Service Center (HDSC) has the solution. This Service Center will provide temporary housing, permanent housing, job skills training and teaching including schools, etc., for many of the Hawaiian population described above. 

Currently, there are approximately 150 Dream Centers around the world to help people that are in need that are hurting, homeless, gang members, and the incarcerated.  This project will be located on 204 acres in Kunia (Waipahu) and will be dedicated to helping Hawaii's people in need and will make a paradigm shift like never before to address Hawaii's ever growing social issues.

Our team has been working on the plans and proposals for twelve years by building relationships with the Federal Government, State of Hawaii, City, County, Churches, Neighborhood Boards, Community Leaders, Ministries, Prisons and others.


We hope that you will be as excited about this project as we are and have the vision to help humanity in Hawaii. We need your help.  Please visit our website at www.hawaiidreamservicecenter.org and make a difference.

&gt;MILLER: Mr. bin Laden, you have issued a fatwah calling on Muslims to kill Americans where they can, when they can. Is that directed at all Americans, just the American military, just the Americans in Saudi Arabia? 

&gt;OSAMA BIN LADEN: Allah has ordered us to glorify the truth and to defend Muslim land, especially the Arab peninsula ... against the unbelievers.

His teeth sang in their individual sockets like tuning forks, each one pitch-perfect and clear as ethanol.  His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed and polished, the joints lubricated with a film of silicone.

"science","t5_mouw","What exactly has the Hagia Sophia got to do with science? It was extremely influential on architecture, but architecture isn't science. Architecture doesn't involve testing a hypothesis in order to prove or disprove some natural phenomenon like physics, or chemistry, or biology. The pyramids - same argument. While there's mathematics involved in everything we do (whether we know it or not), math isn't commonly thought of as a science; but this is contested.

Back in those historical times, nobody was using aborted fetuses the size of a pinhead to spear medical research. Religion wasn't stepping on the toes of science as much as is happening today, because in those early days, science wasn't eroding religious belief like it is now. I can't speak so much for Islam as I can for Christianity, because I'm not as familiar with it.

I'm sorry - we're not talking about arts at all. That has nothing to do with our discussion. However David has been pissed on (figuratively) by many Christians for being nude, and therefore in their eyes, pornographic. Let's stay on topic though.

KKK was religiously motivated, and they persecuted even Christians that weren't protestant. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism#United_States

Re: religion and homosexuality, yes while it's contested, Christianity is commonly accepted as being against it, as is Islam and many other religions, especially Judaism. It doesn't matter that some people have abandoned the verses the condemn it, the fact is, their religious textbook prohibits it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_homosexuality#Christianity

People ignore all parts of the bible that doesn't fit with their beliefs. The bible, as a whole is cherry picked in order to support what somebody wants it to support. That doesn't mean there aren't people who believe everything it says and follow it to the letter as best as possible. There are all kinds of religious folk along the spectrum - the label means little.

DADT shouldn't been enacted in the first place. What you probably don't realize about gay guys is that they're not all desperate for cock and don't get turned on by everyone around them if they're naked. I'm guessing you're a straight male, so I'll ask you this: do you get turned on by every woman you meet?

You've missed my point entirely. You seem to think I'm arguing that all religious people are evil and that religion is 100% harmful. You appear to militant when I'm being moderate, and closed minded when I'm being open minded. Yes, we're arguing opposing cases, but you're misinterpreting my sentiment.

I'm not knocking on the religious people that don't enforce their beliefs on other people. I'm not saying people shouldn't believe what they want. What I'm fundamentally saying is that people can do whatever the hell they want so long as it does as little harm to others as possible. Frankly, I don't care if someone believes rainbows are a result of UFOs and people will be anally probed for eternity if they don't eat 16 berries a day; I'll give a damn if they try to get legislation enacted that makes everyone eat 16 berries a day.

Religion isn't irrelevant. It is a fundamental driving force behind many people's thinking, globally. It impacts the decisions people make in the long-term, the wars countries wage, and the progress that's made over all.

There's good and bad in everything, but religion, while it's not 100% bad, has a bad track record.","1288577676"

The leader of the church at the time gave a sermon that basically stated how the majority of the beliefs that we'd built our entire lives around had been wrong. The church experienced a huge splinter and after a little bit of time we left because it was almost too painful to continue in this new version of the church that felt like the old one but was so different.

My grandparents on both sides and other family members went to different splinter groups so the biggest problem was that we were leaving our entire social group, family group, and way of life.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","**1. One who opens the set, owns the set. **
He gets first choice of target.This is plain and simple. If you open you get first choice of the target. If you are coming into the set make sure that you have already worked out a code like “have you seen jimmy” to signify if the person wants a wing.

**2. The primary purpose of wing is to help his friend get his target.** 
Again straight forward, you are not there to compete you are there to DHV your friend and occupy the obstacle. 

**3. Don't steal a target. **
See previous law of winging if you don't get this. NOTE: Stealing the target happens a lot because most people don't understand buying temperature. You are not there to take away attraction or attention you are there to occupy the obstacle. 

**4. Always agree with your wing. **
Never take the girls side over him. He is always right. No matter WHAT he says always agree with him. Most guys trying to compete by being Aggressors or Competitors over women, YOU WILL NOT! 

**5. Wing doesn't run the game: His partner gets all the attention. **
The Wing is just there to have support his friend by laughing at his jokes and building RAPPORT with the group, nothing else. This means that the wing's attention should be focused on the obstacle and building a connection with her. 

**6. Wing doesn't hit on anyone until he is sure who is the partner's target in the set.**
Another very important rule to follow is that you MUST know who the target is before you do anything stupid. When it doubt ask which the bad one is. The bad one will be the target. 

**7. Do not enter an opened set unless you are sure you are invited. **
If you enter a set make sure to first DHV your friend and tell how you guys met, buy him a drink or just do something to raise his value in general.
 
**8. Once you are talking to the obstacle get her back to her friends. **
You want the backs of the targets to be against each other, to accomplish this slowly shift to your right or left whichever is positioning her to face AWAY from her friend. This will allow your friend to get much more personal without fear of persecution from her friend. 

**9. If anyone comes in the set distract them!**
If an AMOG comes into the set then you are to befriend him and take him out of the equation to the best of your ability, same with girls. Everyone who is not your friend's target is an obstacle and therefore it is the job of the wing to occupy them! 

Hope this helps,

Then dig out the sand.
Light the top of the log and swat out any (0-3) fires (especially on the sides of the log and underside of the log above) that spread except for the top part of the log.  Lighting the underside of the log above seemed to do the trick of lighting the top of the bottom log without the log above burning, but it could be superstition.

The gap is small enough that a monster only needs to brush/jump against it to catch fire, and the small hole keeps items from burning.  If something gets caught in it, the items will be safely ejected.

Please, be careful when building around flammable materials, and fire can jump around and burn without restrictions on SMP (such as obsidian).

          if yourAge + herAge &lt;= 50

                    BreakUp()

Take a look at the global results on page 6. The black line represents actual data and the colored sections represent forcings. Please note that the warming in the 30's/40's 
are not able to be calculated in the models' parameters. After the inclusion of CO2 as a forcing agent, suddenly there is a correlation with temperatures. Only after about 1970. 
The models do not cacullate the warming which actually occurred prior to adding in CO2 forcing....even when the claim was that the warming in the 30's and 40's was NOT manmade but had natural causes. 
Now IF warming that actually occurred was not able to be calculated by the models, and they have to add CO2 forcing to get the models to run in the second part of the century......what if? the increase is actually due to the same type occurrence as happened in the first part of the last century?

I know supposedly that has all been calculated away....And that is one of the reasons that GISS tries to downplay earlier temperatures, to make it seem not as hot then compared to now.","1288577769"

"science","t5_mouw","As shady as patent law may be, nobody is issuing patents for random sequences. You have to figure out what something is before a patent is issued for it.

I said this elsewhere in the thread, but I agree that patenting human genes is, for the most part, bullshit. Considering how commonly researched humans are, and how few products are likely to result from our genes, I can't see any reason why they should exist.

However, it isn't as simple as all that. Remember that a gene is nothing but a blueprint for a protein. Proteins can be drugs, reagents, or chemical stabilizers among other things. For example, vancomycin, the current antibiotic of last resort, was discovered in a rare organism living in the soil of Borneo. Because it's a biological product, it was produced by a gene. To me, this seems like a much more logical patent - they really did have to go out and discover it, and nobody is going to be doing much research on it in the future.

Now, you'd think ""why not just patent vancomycin""? You certainly could, there wouldn't be the slightest question of the validity of it. However, since the gene is the blueprint for it, it would be relatively simple to isolate the gene and insert it in another organism for mass production. You could even add tags to the end of it so it isn't exactly vancomycin, but it's going to do the same thing.","1288577797"

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","We have an Aussie... and he sheds a fair amount. He's a great dog- no nipping, a little more counter surfing than we'd like, but they really are amazing intelligent dogs. Not that poodles are bad, (in fact, I hear they're ridiculously cool as well) I just felt like plugging aussies a little bit. :)

We did go through a breeder. We live in a part of Oregon that has pit bulls shipped in from Cali to be adopted. You can't find dogs besides pitbulls or pit mixes. Everyone around here has a pit, and they're great dogs (when they come from the right circumstances), but we wanted an aussie. 

We started looking for puppies in March, and found a breeder that was planning a litter for May. She had been breeding Aussies for a while, and invited us to meet her dog before the puppies came (right after she became pregnant) so we would know what she was like. She also directed us to the Stud's website/breeder, if we had questions for them.  

She quizzed us. Aussies aren't for everyone, and she wanted to make sure we were an appropriate family for this breed of dog. We didn't have to quiz her. She told us everything about how she raised the puppies, she showed us where they would be born, where they would sleep, play, etc... what they would eat when their mom started weaning them... EVERYTHING. She also told us about the potential health problems that aussies can have. She showed us her dog's certificates of health (that were recent- many things have to be re-checked prior to each litter). She has pictures of her dog wining championships, and herding sheep, and all of that business. She also invited us to come visit the puppies while they were growing up. We went up to Washington to visit three times before we came home with a pup. When we came home with the pup, he was almost 9 weeks old, he had finished his first vaccinations/puppy well-check, his eyes had been CERF'd, and he had been structurally assessed to decide whether he was pet or show quality. The puppies were all very laid back, and used to being touched all over. They had completed the neurological stimulation series that the armed forces puts working dogs through. We had to sign a contract, and we got copies of not only our dog's health history, but his mother's health information too.  We still email back and forth- especially when I have questions, and we met up last weekend for a little reunion. We'll get our AKC registration papers once we provide proof that he's been neutered. 

It really is a fun and wonderful experience going through a breeder. We know every little thing about the history of our dog. We have someone with a sibling and the mother of the dog that we can contact any time for help or advice.  I know I'll probably get downvoted for saying breeders are great, but when they are competent and responsible... they are great! We have the dog that we want. He's true to type, and we knew exactly what we were getting when we brought him home. I know this is long, but I hope it helps! :)","1288577827"

Even if their research does point to a new medical tech, it will be developed here, because investors can make back their money and some (gasp) profit that makes their investment worthwhile in comparison to say a snack food company.

Take a look at Russia for an example of what happens when the government decides what technologies are best, instead of just providing a little boost to basic research. Ternary computers, ftw?

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","Entropic disorder isn't easy to define conceptually.  My understanding is that a definable pattern or distinction represents an ordered state.  When you pour cream into a cup of coffee, for example, the cream and the coffee are initially separate, and there is a thermal gradient between the two.  Both of these disparities represent an unstable ordered state, so the grouped molecules of the cream rapidly dissipate and spread throughout the coffee, and the temperature equilibrates in the process.  The more evenly the two liquids are mixed, the more disordered the overall state of the cup of coffee, since there is now one encompassing pattern describing the whole system.

Or consider Knomez' note on nuclear fusion.  When two hydrogen nuclei combine to form deuterium, the pairing creates a fixed pattern, which, to a degree, increases the order of the system.  However, the overall disorder is increased because the process also releases photons, which are basically unbounded energy.  The energy had been tied up in matter, a more highly ordered state of energy, but was released to propagate freely.","1288577907"

You feel that some how that healthcare is a right that shouldn't be taken from you just because you can't pay for it.  That you should also be payed despite not being employed.  While I certainly understand the plight you put forward here I don't think the government should be involved in making sure you as an individual stay solvent or healthy.

That's the whole point of a flat tax.  There are no loopholes.  Everyone pays the same percentage regardless of income and there are no deductions.  A fair tax (federal sales tax) has been put forward as a way to tax all people fairly based on the amount of ""stuff"" they buy.  The rich pay more as they buy more and the poor pay less as they buy less.  Either way there are no loopholes and no deductions.  

I don't understand your logic in the last paragraph here.  The rich would pay that federal sales tax on everything they purchase.  They would easily pay more then the poor as they wouldn't be buying bologna as .99/lbs but fillet at $19/lbs.  The more you spend the more you pay. It also rewards people for saving, which I think is a good thing.  

As with all things though it's always a balance somewhere.  All of these can be abused and will be abused or taken advantage of in some way I'm sure.  what it does though is make one rule that applies to everyone.  That's a level playing field.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Look it doesn't bother me that the death penalty is applied in Muslim countries as long as people are not wrongfully convicted.  It's not like it's extremely difficult for people to not ""practice witchcraft"" or engage in homosexual acts.  You don't just accidentally commit those crimes; the criminals know the punishment, so they accepted the risk.  Also, state execution is not within the legal definition of ""murder.""

Also, I don't know what you mean by ""core texts.""  The only core text is the Qur'an itself, and not all of these punishments are mentioned in it like you are saying.

Furthermore, by ""religious people"", you must be referring specifically to Christians, because most religions don't typically refer to all of their religious practices and texts as ""the word of God.""  In Islam, only the Qur'an is the word of God, and beyond that what other things I choose to agree with are not the word of God.  Islam specifically understands that there are multiple possible interpretations to Islam and that the practice of it is always open to human error.  We shouldn't satisfy ourselves by letting our religion stay stagnant as people like you might prefer, when it is incumbent upon us to continue to study and apply our reasoning.

Again you're accusing me of believing what I believe.  Of course I agree with the things I picked; I chose my own religion.  If I didn't believe something wasn't true, I wouldn't bother disagreeing with it in the first place, so of course I believe the things I disagree with are misinterpreted.

It's a shame Luther didn't believe in an intermediate state. This is really his personal heresy that broke down two elements of the historic Christian faith: veneration of the saints and shrinking the Christian canon by removing whatever didn't agree with soul sleep (I'm looking at you, 2 Maccabees). A number of things that are considered ""essential"" to Lutheranism really wouldn't have been an insurmountable obstacle to an Orthodox-Lutheran communion: priesthood of all believers is believed by both, for instance, though both sides have similar notions of a ""consecrated"" priesthood usually accompanied by a ""calling."" Anyway, remove the involvement of the blessed dead in our everyday lives and you remove a core part of the Christian faith. Christianity becomes another piece of modern, fashionable liberal sensibilities that can rationalize away the General Resurrection by removing it as an eschatological expectation yet still claim orthodoxy.","1288578009"

There's a bunch of websites and phone apps like [Daily Burn](http://dailyburn.com/) that help you do this, hopefully people will link some other good ones here.","1288578032"

It also really depends on whether or not you would consider killing your neighbors and killing the aid workers sent there to help your country as someone who is fighting against an occupation force. People always love the ""well if the US was invaded wouldn't you attack the invading troops?"" question except that question/argument has some major flaws. I would not attack my neighbors. I would not bomb markets filled with civilians. And if the US was run by a corrupt dictator who lived in luxury while his people starved and hunted down and murdered those who dared speak out against him and a foreign country came in and removed him and then had the decency to stick around and help get things up and running again, I would not attack the foreign troops.

So yes, it is entirely the fault of the insurgents and terrorists. Muqtada al Sadr didn't have to be a power hungry psychopath. Al Qaeda in Iraq didn't have to try and turn neighbors against each other. The former Iraqi Army members and Fedayeen Saddam didn't have to continue the fight after they had lost and a new, democratic government was made. The Iraqi people actually voted on their constitution. The US Constitution came about because delegates of twelve states (Rhode Island didn't show up) decided to go ahead and dissolve the Articles of Confederation without really telling any citizens about it and adopt the Constitution. And the creation of the US Constitution was done in secret and only nine states had to ratify it.","1288578077"

out with a girl who I want to sleep with I get on top and rest one of my

it's working you can start to rub a little more and if she doesn't 
stop you then, my friend, she is allowing you to turn her on.

Dilma has pros and cons in that regard. In the positive side, there is no mid term election for the Houses in Brazil, elections are ""in block"", so she will not be jeopardized by a hostile congress in two years. On the other hand, the Brazilian party system is pulverized, completely different from the two-party system of the US, and Dilma's majority is in fact given by a coalition of parties that eventually may fragment.

You just need to remember one thing.  It never gets any easier than it is right now.  Delaying it only hurts the other person more.  It feels terrible to hurt someone else but there is no saving them from it.  To put it bluntly.  There is nothing you can do more for them than to be honest, prompt, decisive and final.  

Lastly remember one thing, and this is a clarification.  The ""cut all contact"" bit of the classic RA advice is not advice to make it easier on you (the dumper).

Native Koreans tend to be less laid back. It is part of their (my?) culture to be respectful, especially to those that are your seniors. When you go into a store, let's say, you will be treated as a superior, no matter how old you are. Try to reciprocate this with good manners, which I'm sure you already do since you are gonna be teaching. 

Socially, just be courteous and generous. By all means, you should speak your mind when you disagree with something, but do so in a polite manner and never throw a fit. Act in a professional manner like you would in a classroom. 

That being said, you will have a blast! Food is great, especially if you like beef, seafood and spicy things. The language is a bit hard to learn, but you'll eventually pick it up since you are there. I'm not sure how it is now, but I remember a while ago when one of my American friends went that he received a lot of attention from the locals. Koreans love it when other nationals get a glimpse of their country.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Dude, this is insane!!!!! This is NOT a healthy relationship, at all. If there's anything you can learn by posting this message, is to go back and re-read what is actually going on in your relationship. And then ask yourself, how long can you put up with this? 

If you've spoken to her about her insecurities and you haven't seen substantive change, then listening to everything that every fiber in your body is telling you is probably what is in your best interest. 

If you decide to break up with her, remember that you CANNOT be responsible for her feelings. She may pull all sorts of crazy stunts  to get you back (i.e., sleeping with ex)... and it may work, but dude, this chick is not mentally healthy. That said, you can ONLY be responsible for your feelings in this situation. You may care about her a lot, but in the end you have to do what is in your best interest since her needs are bringing you down. She isn't being reasonable, not even in the slightest bit, about her demands on your time. It's ludicrous!

I hope that in 5 years time you look back on this relationship and ask yourself, why didn't you leave sooner? There's so many other amazing women out there that will be respectful and cool and be able to fulfill their needs without you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It never stopped raining since the bomb went off.

That was good.  It kept the zombies at bay.  They were fierce, but not smart, and the rain confused them.

It gave Dan and Jessica a head start.  Just enough.  When they first fled the building, he had held her hand.  She has wished for it for the last year that they had worked together.  But not like this.

For two days, they never spoke.  Not about Jessica's husbad.  Not about what they had left behind.  Or Dan's past life.  The one he had never really lived.  

By day four, they couldn't keep their mouths shut.  But all they spoke of was the weather.  ""Hot,"" said one.  ""Wet,"" said the other.  ""Miserable,"" they both agreed.

By two weeks, they stopped seeing other survivors.  But they never stopped holding hands.  

Jessica had thought of this so many times. She was the receptionist at ORBITZ.  A major studio in LA.  And Dan was and writer.  Just a run of the mill story guy.  Like so many others in Southern California.  

She had thought of touching him.  His hand, his arm, his mouth.  She never dreamed it would happen.  Then again, she never dreamed the world would end.  But apparantly, that's what it took to bring them together.  

Dan's hair grew longer.  So did his beard.  Sometimes they found a car and would drive it until it ran out of gas.  Walk for a while, then find another one.  As they reached northern California, they started driving and walking off road.  Zombies tended to keep to where their previos kills had been, so once they got deep into the mountains bordeering Oregon, they rarely saw any.  That was a blessing.  Now, though hungry and dirty and tired, they could finally start to relax.  

They had driven the van up a tiny logging road that ran up the side of a mountain.  They eventually parked near a small waterfall.  Clear, glacial water trickled downt the side of a stone wall with enough force to make a perfect shower.  The water was cold and clean and sweet.  

The van had very little gas left.  Not enough to make it back down the mountain.  They instinctively knew they should stop here.  The van was stocked with enough food for them to get by for a few weeks if they were careful.  

They set up camp.  They used ropes to raise their food in bags high up into the trees to keep away animals.  They started a fire.  They had never dared to before.  But so far from what was left of civilization, they began to feel brave again.  The back of the van floor made a bed.

""I need a shower,"" Jessica said.  ""I can't remember the last time I was clean.""  

""I'm starting to feel like there's a lot I can't remember,"" Danl answered.

""I know what you mean,"" Jessica said.  ""It's like life was a dream and we've woken up to find ourselves in this nightmare.""

Jessica went first, taking a blanket with her.  The water of the tiny waterfall was freezing.  But she didnt' care.  It was clean.  And for the first time in 3 weeks, so was she.  After rinsing off, she wrapped herself in the blanket and went back to camp.  

Dan, ever the gentleman, never peaked as she washed.  But he couldn't help but notice her nipples, erect from the cold, were clearly visible through the thin blanket.

""You look cold,"" he said.  

""It's a good change after the head and the rain.""  she said.

""Good point,"" he answered, as he went to the fall for his own shower.  

He returned shortly, also wrapped in a blanket and sat with her by their fire.  She had heated soup and she handed him a bowl full.

""God,"" he said as he hungrily ate the first warm meal he had had in weeks.  ""I almost feel like a real person again.""

""Me too,"" said Jessica.  ""They're all dead, aren't they?"" she said to him.  ""Everyone else.""

""I doubt it,"" he answered.  ""There's got to be someone else.  Like us.""

""Dave is dead,"" Jessica said.  ""I can just tell.""  She looked down at her wedding ring.  Dan squeezed her hand.  ""Did you have have a girlfriend or wife or anything?  I've seen you every day, walking into work, for that last couple years.  But we never really talked.""

Dan cringed inwardly.  ""Naw.  Not me.  A mom, that's all.""

""Oh,"" said Jessica.  

""I never had a girlfriend,"" Dan said.  He didn't know why he said it.  No point in keeping secrets now, though.

Jessica looked surprised.  Dan was tall, rugged, in his late 20's. He build was smaller but still very masculine.  A catch for any girl.  ""Never?""

""Never."" Danl said.  ""I've always been shy or something.  I dunno.""  Jessica thought about Dan.  And about Dave.  She had always secretly longed for Dan.  And now having him so close, and being so alone, she found herself wanting him even more.  She hadn't had sex in a month and it was starting to nag at her.  Even in this miserable state.  But with the shower and the fire and the warm food, her libido was quickly returning.

""Well, if you're ever interested, I know this girl.  She's kind of grungy.  But she's recently become available.""  Dan laughed slightly.  

""Yeah, I guess it is sort of our job to rebuild the human race.  Oh god, that's a scary thought.  All of humanity built of the genes of a fuck up like me.""

""You're not a fuck up,"" Jessica said.  ""You're brilliant.  You're one of the best writers around. Everyone at the studio always talked about you.""  

""Sure, I can write. But other things in life have always been a mystery to me.  Women, for one.   But it was never an issue.  No girl has ever wanted me, I can tell you that for free.""

Jessica bit her lip.  She hesitated.  ""I...."" she started.  ""I wanted you.""

Dan stared at her.  ""It's ok,"" she went on, ""I never expect you'd feel the same way.  Please dont' worry, I just dont' want you to think that no one ever wanted you.""  She stared into her soup.  ""I wanted you every day.""  Dan's mouth gaped.  He looked at Jessica as though he were seeing her for the first time.  Her dark brown hair and eyes.  Her small, heart shaped face.  Her thin, tired body.  They looked into one another's eyes.

""Jess,"" he said, ""I had no idea.""  She laughed.

""I know, I wanted it that way.  I am,"" she stopped.  ""I WAS a married woman.""

Maybe it was the end of the world.  Maybe it was the warmth and food that gave him courage.  Maybe it was her words.  She wanted him.  She had for years.  Inside, he suddenly started feeling that the man he always wanted to be could be becoming a reality.

""You look cold,"" he said to her and put an arm around her shivering shoulders.  She felt so small.  He rubbed her back gently, leaned towards her ear and whispered, ""I want you too.""  

She reached up and stroked his long, unkempt hair, looking deeply into his eyes.  She leaned in and kissed him.  Inside, his heart throbbed with an excitement he had never felt.  Never dreamed he *could* feel.  His crotch began to get hot and he could feel his penis rising under the blanket, no pants to hold it down.

They kissed passionately, with all the inhibition that comes with the end of the world.  As they stopped for breath, Jessica let the blanket slide over her shoulders, exposing her naked breasts.  Her small pink nipples were hard from the cold and from arousal.  Dan stared.  And then started to laugh.  ""Is this real?  I mean, I never, NEVER thought in my life,"" he paused.  ""I've never been with a woman.  I just want you to know.""  

""Good,"" Jessica said, smiling.  ""Then I can be your teacher.  You have a lot a remedial work to do.""  She reached for his large hands and placed them on her small breasts.  He massaged gently, working his thumb towards the nipple.  Then squeezing and playing with her erect tits, his member throbbing

Jessica stood up, keeping the blanket around her waist.  She guided him to the open back of the van.  ""Now my turn,"" she said.  She reached down and slid the blanket off Dan's body.  His prick was fully visible in the firelight.  Hard as a rock and standing straight out.  She gasped with delight when she saw his size.  She used all her willpower to keep from getting on her knees and sucking him off right there.  But she wanted to wait.  She wanted this to last.  

She laid back in the van.  He followed.  She pulled the blanket away from her legs, exposing everything from her waist down.  ""Now,"" she said, ""I'm goign to show you how to take care of a woman.""  She positioned herself so he was between her legs, now slightly open.  He almost died as he waited to see that place between them.

""Now,"" she said, ""You can start by rubbing my lips.""  Dan placed one hand on her soft mound, covered in soft black hair.  He rubbed gently and deeply.  Jessica moaned at the feeling.  ""Now spread the lips apart,"" she said.  Dan gently used his thumbs to open her, pressing her legs farther apart.  She was beautiful, her wetness glistening in the moonlight.  ""Find my clit,"" she told him.  ""Above the opening.""  

Dan used one hand to keep her spread open and the other to rub the small, firm spot above her vagina.  It became harder the more he rubbed.  Jessica was gasping with delight.  She began to thrust her hips forward.  ""Two fingers inside me.""  she said.  ""I need it so bad.""  He immediately slid two fingers into her pussy, all the while rubbing her engorged clit.  ""Oooh,"" Jessica said, her cunt hungrilly eating his large fingers.  She thrust more, bucking and swaying.  She had to stop or she would come.  

Out of breath and full of desire, she sat up and in one movement pushed Dan to the floor.  She raised her body to his head, draping one breast above his mouth. He sucked in the nipple, gently biting, teasing and sucking at it's firmness.  She stradled his large body, rubbing her moist pussy against his middle as shocks went from her breast to her cunt.  

She rubbed her boobs slowly down his body until she found his tremendous prick.  He reached down, squeezing her boobs together and rubbing his throbbing member between them.  Oh god, he needed to cum.  He needed to cum in her.

But she wasn't finished yet.  She slid herself between his legs, forcing them apart.  With one hand, she grabbed his waiting penis.  Her other hand found his balls.  And her mouth, his cock.  Dan never could have imagined the pleasure that came with a beautiful girl sucking his cock.  He had tried, but the real thing was nothing like his day dreams.  She bobbed and thrust and groaned, taking his cock all the way to the base. He was almost screaming, everything in him straining not to cum into her mouth.  

""I can't take it anymore, Jess, I need you.  I need you now.""  He pulled her off his prick and laid her back on the floor.  She smiled at him as he positioned himself between her spread legs.  His hand guided his cock to her opening.  He rubbed the tip on the outside for a moment.  Then with no hesitation, he plunged into her warmth.  

Jessica screamed.  It was so good it was almost surreal.  She placed her legs on his shoulders, giving him full access to her womanhood.  She was so wet he slid easily in and out.  In and out.  The pace and the intensity rose.  She came first, crying out with pleasure.  Moments later, Dan followed, filling her waiting hole with his hot cum.  ""Oh god,"" he said, ""There is nothing like a warm pussy.  Nothing fucking like it.""

He waited inside her until his heart calmed down and he caught his breath.  Then he rolled off her, taking her into his warm arms and pulling the blanket over them both.  

She said with contentment and stretched against him.  The end of the world was going a lot better than she expected.  ","1288578129"

How I took it for granted that my 1991 BMW 525iA (A for Automatic) with around 150k miles on the clock took me to my fastest traveling speed ever of 256kmh or 155mph.  Now we have mothers bitching at their sons over facebook wall comments relating to how fast they went on the Autobahn.  

How after I cracked the cylinder head in my 1991 525ia, after the headgasket failed and I didn't stop driving when it was overheating (that was a good lesson though, nearly had the same thing happen to me with my current car) that my loving parents... well actually it was more luck and a irrational mother, gifted me a brand new 2003 BMW 530iA (my dad bought it for my mom, but moms was like fuck that, I want a convertible son) so my dad bought a 2004 BMW 325Cic for my mom, and I got a pimp brand new BMW to drive around Deutschland now.  Since the 2003 530i was U.S. Spec, the top speed was limited to 130mph, which was okay, because I once drove from Schweinfurt Germany, to Amsterdam in 3 hours (very early on a Sunday morning, left around 4am, no traffic) doing my best to maintain 130mph the whole way from Schweinfurt, to the border of the Netherlands.  I would've gotten to Amsterdam faster since it took me 2 hours to get to the Netherlands from Schweinfurt, and an hour of putting along the snelweg (dutch autobahn) at 130kmh averaging 30mpg.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I'm not obsessed with Ayn Rand by any means. But anyone who claims to be a Libertarian or has libertarian views should learn more about her and read some of her work. 

It was Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand that sparked my interest in the moral and economic side of politics. 

Ayn Rand was a flawed human being that was fairly controversial because of her atheism, her love life and some of her somewhat militant views on certain subjects. 

Near the end of her life I think she came to term with many of these things. They are quite evident in the video's of hers that I watched on Youtube. 

People who obsess over these types of individuals annoy me just like anyone else. I take bits and pieces of countless individual to make up a solid foundation for my own personal beliefs. 

Its the principles which these people stand for that I respect, not neccesarily their personal lives or some of the things they have said and done in the past. 

Perfect example is Thomas Jefferson who owned slaves. Ayn Rand fooled around with younger men while she was married. And people like Ron Paul and Milton Friedman are just excellent examples of individual who love and cherish freedom. 

Its really quite amazing to think about. If you could put many of these classical Liberals, Libertarians or even a few conservatives in the same room they probably wouldn't get along with one another. They might even want to slug one another in the face, lol. 

But I compare it to the Rush the band, they make great music (IMO) but none of them can stand to be on the same tour bus with one another. Its the collection of ideas what the things these people stand for or stood for that I hope people never forget. ","1288578177"

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","There's got to be more to it than this.  I've created only 1 portal of my own, and have roughly 5-6 now.  

First time I entered the portal, I got a Nether equivalent.  This was fine.  I built a crappy little stone house that surrounded the portal  and then decided to go back to the normal realm.  Once I left, I ended up with a 2nd real-world portal.  I covered both sides of this second portal in dirt and then re-entered my first real-world portal.  Instead of returning to the same Nether portal, I ended up in an entirely NEW Nether portal.  I then died in Hell...so I can't say for sure if I would have gotten a third real-world portal :/.

In any case, it makes it very tough to construct any kind of base in the Nether if each time you enter you arrive in a new location.","1288578193"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I mainly shop at [bodybuilding.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com) &amp; [iherb](http://www.iherb.com).  They both have very good prices.

Whichever is cheaper at the time.

If I lived in the US instead of Canada I would probably order [Life Force Multiple](http://www.iherb.com/Source-Naturals-Life-Force-Multiple-No-Iron-120-Tablets/1259?at=0) for a multi but since I can't get it across the border I order [Orange Triad](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/clabs/orangetriad.html).  With either of these, I don't use the full dosage as I find it unnecessary.  With the Orange Triad I use 2-3 tabs a day since I eat pretty healthy for the most part.

Along with whey protein and creatine, that's everything I need right there.","1288578195"
