The vast majority of the posters in this subreddit are clearly children. If you want to prove me wrong, you do the survey.

Yes Whiney Dad worry about woman never being able to live up to the girls in the game, no guy will ever live up to being Duke Nukem either.

In short I think he's a terrible father, all he's doing is perpetuating the growth that we're going to have a nation of whining simpering people that have no sense of humor and instead would rather blog about it then explain to their kids what satire is.

My dad was a Man's man.  He played guitar, worked on Harleys, slept with tons of women (after the divorce), apologized when he was wrong and knew when he should and shouldn't say things.  Not to mention he was only 5'8'"" and was a tough SOB.  But, he could also explain ""the ghost in the machine"", treat people with respect, charm the pants off anyone, and teach my sister and I how to be good people.

I sit there sort of stunned and few something wet running down my face.   The guy who appeared to be in charge comes over, asks what happened.  I tell him the other guy hit me.

I used it to fill in the gaps when things came up that I needed to pay for and couldn't afford at the moment.  Obviously not ideal but people sometimes need or want to pay for things when they can't afford them.  I am mainly pissed off because BoA bought out my bank and doubled the rate so now paying it off is priority number one.  Sure I can only blame myself for being less than perfectly responsible but in the long run I take it as a lesson in prioritizing.  Now that I am in a situation that allows for more savings I will not need to use credit as often in the future.  

Right now my main issue is how much to save and how much to put toward paying off the balance.  In theory I would want to put every extra cent into paying off this high interest debt but at the same time I want at least some cushion in savings so that I am not tempted or forced to use credit for emergencies or just flexibility.","1306886411"

But, I was arguing for the scientifically decided ""cut off"" time for abortions based on legal rights.

Baby's have legal rights. This is reflected in child abuse laws and act's that give killers more time for killing a pregnant woman.

Based on that, I think there should be a scientifically proved time at which the fetus is considered a baby and abortions should be illegal based on that scientifically found time frame. We already give babies rights once they're born, yet part of the time before they're born they are already developed, feel pain and are considered a person if killed.

"MusicCritics","t5_2seti","Hey guys, this is the first installment of a new thing I want to do, where I'll be taking popular examples of slightly obscure or less heard of music genres and examining them more closely.

I want to start off with a genre that isn't so obscure, I thought the popular Yoruba influenced Afrobeat was a good place to start. Since it is not too unlike many popular genres in western culture. And, who better than the father of Afrobeat himself, Fela Kuti. Fela is a superb musician, who was very skilled on many different instruments. Though, he mainly composed most of his songs on keyboards and would routinely play sax at live shows. 

Afrobeat is a complex genre that blends traditional Yoruba music with funk, jazz, and rock, as well as West African chanting rhythms. The music often blends many different melodies creating a polyrhythmic structure.  Fela's band in particular often used two saxophonists and two bassists to reach an extreme meshing of melodic rhythms.

 The end result is a very creative expression of traditional African music combined with more modern music styles. It's definitely worth looking more into. Fela is obviously one of the key places to start, as well as his son Femi Kuti. Other notable performers and groups are Ade Bantu, Tony Allen, Sonny Okosun, Afrodizz, The Chicago Afrobeat Project, and Kokolo. Hope you enjoy exploring this great music genre.","1306886437"

I meant to comment on your original posting, but refrained, since it seemed to have taken off well before I got there.

I will only say this: the fact that you played in college, and that it wasn't until college that someone suggested you might have potential for the minor leagues tells me that you'd have more chance playing the lottery than making the majors. This has nothing to do with whom you fancy.

Potential big league players are such at the age of 17 or 18. They will not make the show until six or seven years later, if ever. College is too late. 

On the one hand, the disgrace with which your teammates treated you is a shame; on the other, every player on every team ever has been mocked for the reason which is  most easy. If you had been a hetero with red hair, you would have been mocked for that (although perhaps not as ruthlessly).

Do what you love, and love what you do. There are precious few ballplayers who have a math background to fall back upon. And it's a damn shame that you were given grief because you bravely insisted on forcing people to respect your sexuality.

But here's where you're going to get angry with me: Nobody really cares who you sleep with. Nobody really cares about what happens off the field (provided it doesn't hurt your performance). At least until you throw it in their faces.

Personally I don't give a damn, but I recognize that there is an unofficial ban on open gays in sports. My opinion is that a sportsman need not say a damn thing about who he or she goes home with.

But unless you're Jackie fucking Robinson, you probably don't want to take the fight on by yourself. 

In any sense, don't worry. You weren't going to make the show anyway (right now there's a player that plays bigger, is stronger, faster, hits better, steals better, throws better, and is hungrier than you'll ever be).

So fuck baseball, and fuck the minors. Instead, and quite literally, fuck whom you want to fuck ...

Really? Protections for children, the elderly, and the mentally ill are just ""social contracts,"" and have no moral basis? What about sexual consent laws? Those don't have any moral basis either - they're purely practical and contractual (e.g. you don't rape me I don't rape you)? Is that how you think our society operates?

Our society is grounded in morals. Without morals, we are laboring single-person corporations who abide by regulation alone.

18 hours might be a stretch on the battery, until you get into custom ROMs and underclock the CPU when it's idle. The battery door is notoriously hard to get into and you'll have a major problem if you break it - the phone doesn't power on without the door.

If `:=` is the ""first assignment"" operator, `x +:= 1` (shorthand for `x := x + 1`) would define a variable that already exists by referencing the same variable. The semantics would be confusing if the left-hand `x` referred to a different variable than the implied right-hand `x`.

The only meaningful solution is to namespace the variables, but there's no point in doing so explicitly if you could already just rename the variables into something completely different to avoid the problem (or use `nonlocal` to mess with non-local variables).","1306886458"

Language is interesting in that if enough people use a term incorrectly, it becomes correct. So one day, things might change.

The issue I have with this is that I watch a video of a former Miss USA woman being groped by the TSA. She says that they touched her vagina. So then I think, ""Wait, they fingered you to inspect for drugs?"" Miss USA is a role model for girls and is making an allegation. It perpetuates the error for younger people and causes confusion for anyone taking her words seriously.

It's similar to think of me saying someone touched my penis, then they point to my penis, and I say, ""No, what's wrong with you, I'm talking about here,"" and then I point to my scrotum. Why is it more acceptable to make that mistake with a female than with a male.","1306886460"

Why are there more homeless men than women? More boys dropping out of school, and less guys going to college? WAY more men in jail? More men killing themselves? The law clearly favours women, and basically every career involving children has become off limits to men. 

If our society was so spectacular for men, this shit wouldn't be going on.

Yeah, there are a tiny number of elite men who have more power than women. The VAST majority of men don't. Then when we have feminists going ""Hey, don't look at us, that's your own fault! It's because we live in a man loving patriarchy... OUR hands are clean and WE'RE the eternal victims here!"", it's not exactly helping.

Tychus's whole character was ""This guy is going to betray you."" and there was very little else to him.

2. Each player has a safe box in which monsters cannot spawn and a spawn range. The spawn range sits at 1.2 * screen width and height (in each direction from the player) while the safe box has 0.55 the screen width and height in each direction. Furthermore, if a monster is over 2 screens away from the player, it is no longer considered active and new mobs may be spawned that replaces the inactive ones.

Think of it this way.
If you have the 2010 model of a car and buy the 2012 model, then that's an upgrade; however, if you simply pay to get a new layer of paint on your car, then that isn't really an upgrade. There is a very distinct difference between the two situations. The second never impacts your cars performance.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","Be interesting to see what the price difference is, tho as I re-read your original post a large portion of the cost you are incurring is from the ground mounts.  That may be a catch-22 situation.  More expensive panels = less install cost with everything that goes along with that.   

One thing to consider is it may be better to maximize your ROI versus maximizing net output.  By that I mean find out from them what a roof mount system would cost and what it would produce.  it will likely be a smaller system but if the cost per watt installed is say $2 less it may be a much quicker repay time frame.    If they can talk you into a more expensive system to 'maximize production per panel' which nets them 15k more in install costs they'd do it in a heart beat.  

Also those early morning hours are not too productive.  My 3.2 kw system peaks at about 2600 watts at the middle of the day.  In the early morning it may be at 400-600 watts until the sun is much more overhead.

There are studies showing that people driving under the influence of marijuana are actually BETTER drivers. Not to say that people should be allowed to drive under the influence but if it was legalized there would be a good chance that a breathalyzer for cannabis would be high in demand and would be made almost immediately.

As far as age restriction goes, most kids would say its MUCH harder to get alcohol than it is to get weed. Drug dealers don't care about age, liqour stores do. 

Bullshit, It has proven medical uses. On-top of that recreational use is safe. It does not cause lung cancer, it does not cause brown lung, it does not kill brain cells, and it does not cause mental illness. 

People can just as easily sneak a shot of alcohol in a flask at work if not easier.

Weed is not physically addictive like alcohol. More like gambling. Alcohol is MUCH more addictive and its laughable that you think its not. Weed causes no hangover, or withdrawal. 

Just because you think its trashing doesn't mean it should be illegal. I think cigs are trashy, I think they should be legal.

I used to smoke daily and still smoke occasionally and I can list several ways it has harmed/continues to harm me. I would say marijuana should be decriminalized since no one should go to jail over a stupid plant, but why do we have to legalize it?

Tax revenue sure would be nice, but I just don't believe marijuana is that necessary. I'd make medical marijuana available in all states but I'd take a second thought before making it completely legal. 


Why not just decriminalize it, make medical available in all states, and call it a day? Why do we need to make it more prevalent? Because dumbasses think they're better at everything while high? I'm more creative, but thats about it. Everyone is preaching how great weed is but there are SEVERAL downsides to it that everyone ignores.

I want an answer to this question,

Why do we need to go beyond decriminalization, and medical use, all the way to legalization? And if you think we do, why stop at weed and not go to ecstasy/cocaine/heroine?","1306886520"

The difference is that because there was no supreme court precedent, lower courts applied the law differently. So in some states, if destruction of evidence was prompted by police knocking at the door, that meant it didn't justify a search. In those states, things have changed. Police are free to knock on your door and doing so doesn't disqualify them from claiming exigent circumstances if they hear evidence being destroyed.","1306886522"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Was out painting with a few friends in an abandoned factory area (before I cop all the downvotes, we were only painting on these abandoned warehouses, not houses), there were 4 of us &amp; we were all hitting this one giant wall - one guy was up a ladder, one was laying a fill in throwie &amp; me and another guy were just bombing all over.   It was a pretty open street, right off a main road - cars would've been able to see us from 100m either way..but it was late so we were having fun.  As usual, we were keeping our eyes open for anything we had to run from - and suddenly a car chimes in from the end that comes off the busy road.  We stop, put our cans in our belts &amp; just start walking away from the car (walking in the same direction the car was driving).  One friend stopped and looked back, trying to work out whether it was a cab or a cop car..it was dark &amp; there was minimal street lighting so he wasn't able to tell at first - but as it got closer, we realised it was a cop car.  We acted cool, didn't run or anything - because we didn't know if the cop had seen us getting up.  

The cop drives up to us &amp; slows down, sees that we all have backpacks &amp; tells us to put our bags down and get up against the wall.  We do so, but we keep our bags right in front of us and make sure they're zipped up.  He stays in the car (he is clearly very overweight, so it's possible that he was expecting a bit of a chase) and starts asking us questions in an awkward mannor - using phrases like ""are you boys out for a spray?"" ""let us see your andhays"" etc..finally he asks us what he have in the bags.  3 of us are wise enough to not answer any of his questions (he hasn't asked for ID yet, thankfully) but one of my friends who hasn't really dealt with the police in this type of situation before decides to OPEN UP HIS BACKPACK, SHOW THE CANS TO THE OFFICER AND SAY ""yeah sorry officer, we have paint - here it is.""

The rest of us are standing there brain-palming all thinking ""What the fuck did you just do to us.""  The cop tells my friend to put the bag down &amp; tells us all to stay there while he gets on his radio &amp; calls for backup.  He informs us that he has a dog in the car (he obviously doesn't, as we can see through the windows) and that if we run, he will set the dog on us.  Anyway, as he's on the radio, one of my friends (funnily enough, a guy who doesn't actually paint and who isn't the kind of guy to take the initiative in a situation like this) whispers something along the lines of ""I can't get done for this shit dudes, I'll love my job and my parents will kick me out.  On the count of three, we fucking run - are you guys in?"".  It shot through our heads the shit that we could get into, and we all whisper ""yep"".  He counts down from three, the cop is still on the radio and isn't paying attention to us - and we hit the legs.

If you can imagine that this T is where we are, the top of the T is the street we're on, the bottom of the T is where we run.  I don't know what the cop did at this moment in time, but we were running while ditching our bags over fence.  My pants were falling down because I had them loosened in order to fit 2+ cans in my belt, my friends were in the same situation - so we're running AS FAST AS WE CAN in the middle of nowhere while trying to tighten our pants.  Obviously the details of where we ran won't mean anything to people here, so I'll just go through what happened:

- We got rid of the cans, but we could see the flashing lights of the car behind us.  We run around blocks trying to loose the car, and eventually hide in someone's backyard.  A woman comes out of her house and starts yelling ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY YARD, I'VE CALLED THE POLICE AND THEY'RE ALMOST HERE"".  We apologize and gtfo of her yard, running up her street and trying to work out where the car is (at this point we've only run around the block, so we pretty much know where the car is going to be coming from).  We hide behind big bins, but after a while we realize that one of our friends is missing - we have no idea when we lost him or where he is *will cover this later*

- We realize that the girlfriend of one of our friends lives somewhere near where we are, so we try and work out where her apartment is and start moving.  We've lost the cop car by now, but we can't do anything because I had driven to the area that we were painting &amp; if you remember the 'T', my car was parked on the bottom line.  We ran past my car, and for all we know - the cop is still hanging around the street taking photos of what we'd done (they do this in our area).  We try and keep in the shadows while moving to where the friends girlfriend's place is.  Long story short, we got there - tried to call her but her phone was off.  We didn't know which house she was, so we just hung around in the car park for a while.  Someone yells ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF OUR CARPARK, WE'VE CALLED THE COPS"".  We shit brix.

- We wander around, trying to hide just until shit blows over.  We're trying to call the friend who went missing, but then stop calling - thinking that if he's been caught, the cop will have his phone and will put 2 + 2 together..not that they would track the call or anything hi-tech, but they would have our numbers.  We figure we can leave the car there (we were only a suburb away from where 2/3 of us lived) and start heading towards the main road closest to where we are to catch a bus.  As we get close to the main road, 2 cop cars drive towards us.  Again, we hit the legs and hide in an apartment carpark - we all had jackets on so we take our jackets off and hide them in a trailer along with the rest of the markers we had on us.  We start walking towards the car, taking an extreme diversion so we can see whether the cop car is near my car.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","A *lot* of languages (around a quarter of them) mark evidentiality on their verbs, but English (and most European languages) don't. This means that, for example, in Eastern Pomo, you would conjugate a verb differently depending on whether:

* You experienced the action firsthand (""Cheetos make you throw up. I know because I ate some cheetos and I threw up."")
* You had direct evidence that it happened (""Cheetos make you throw up. I know, because I saw Elmer eat cheetos and then saw him throw up."")
* You had circumstantial evidence that it happened (""Cheetos make you throw up. I know, because I bought a bunch of cheetos for my friends, and when I came by the next day, there was vomit everywhere."")
* Or, you're reporting what you've been told (""Cheetos make you throw up. I know, because I heard about it on Oprah."")

Other languages have other systems, though. Check out the [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidentiality) for more details.

I should note, though, that you *can* make these distinctions in English, as I've done above, but you don't *have* to. If you said ""Cheetos make you throw up."" in the first way to a Pomo speaking guy, and later he found out that you learned that from Oprah, he'd be mad at you for lying to him. Whereas in English, it would only be a lie if you explicitly said you experienced it firsthand.","1306886533"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I met this girl at a friend's house party. Hooked up with her. Got her email. Later, friended her on Facebook, talked to her online almost everyday for a good two weeks or so. She lived a few towns over, about 45 minute drive, so we couldn't really meet up, but I was banking on running into her again so I could hook up with her again. One day, she tells me that she's coming to a friend's birthday party and she's gonna be right near me, and asks what I'm doing that Friday. I say nothing, and she implies that we might be able to hang out afterwords. I tell her yeah maybe we can do something (still hoping to hook up with her afterwords. Keep in mind she had mentioned that she enjoyed it the first time we did it at the house party). I was in class at the time, and for some stupid reason I decided to message my friend (the guy who's house party I had met her at) and mention that I might hook up with her that Friday. Later, I get home and have a bunch of messages from her bitching me out. I message her and ask what's up. Turns out that moments after I talked to him, this asshole messages her and tells her that I said I'm going out with her and I think we're dating. I say no. She shows me a part of the conversation he sent her. I say that's not what I said (he edited out where he asked if we were dating and I said no just hooking up). She calls me a stalker and blocks me. I email him and ask what the fuck. He doesn't get back to me until I email him multiple times, and basically tells me to fuck off and stop bothering him about it. I delete him from messenger/Facebook. Never found out what his motivation was (everything seemed fine the last time I talked to him at the party).

Oh, and I forgot to mention that the reason I couldn't prove it is because I didn't automatically save MSN conversations at the time. Since then, I had to change my settings so I'd always have proof of what I said. Sad, huh? ","1306886537"

"occult","t5_2qhmc","&gt;Even though the two are different experiences I see a state of cosmic consciousness as a stepping stone to astral projection, for me.

OK :)  But in my opinion, having experienced both, astral projection is roughly 1000 times easier than cosmic consciousness.  But that's just me.  I think astral projection is a realistic goal for almost anyone, just like lucid dreaming.  Cosmic consciousness without drugs, while sober, is not so easy.

&gt;It is easier now for me to experience my consciousness outside my body after practicing by visualizing the event to occur. My consciousness slowly started to shift from my body to where I was visualizing it. Eventually they are the same and then I find myself exactly where I was visualizing.

Nice! :)  I like this.

&gt;I cannot forget rituals, not specifically in the context of astral projection, I am a perfecting Rosicrucian so rituals are just a part of life.

Perfecting?  Do you mean practicing?

I am generally against rituals.  But I am not a Rosicrucian.  So you might be a good person to ask, what is the main premise of Rosicrucianism, and are you enjoying it?  What have you learned from it?

I think that a ritual can be a potent help when it's conscious and fresh.  But the more some ritual gets repeated, the more rote and robotic it becomes.  It loses its freshness and becomes just a bunch of motions to go through.  So I don't discount the rituals altogether, but I think for the most part they tend to degrade and to lose potency.  I also agree with Austin Osman Spare that rituals have at least a degree of insincerity to them.  For example, if I want to walk I walk.  I don't perform a ritual so that I may walk.  Why?  Because my walking is sincere.  It's something I am truly capable of doing.  So performing a ritual is like a reminder of one's incapability and impotence.  I always thought so on my own, even before I read about Spare.  But like I said before, I don't think rituals are completely useless, because sometimes we need every help we can get and even if walking on crutches is not the same thing, it may be better than nothing.

So if I were to express this in numbers, while I can admit that rituals can help (when they are fresh, before they had a chance to become robotic, boring and rote), I would break it down as rituals:3 to no-rituals:7, in terms of the score, where the score represents efficacy or importance.","1306886545"

People with 20 years ad experience still have books full of scam ads. The difference is they don't admit it's made up.

I don't know much about pharma. The pharma creatives I've met are more like doctors - with a huge medical knowledge and very little creative freedom. But if a very creative person with a fascinating book happened to have 2 years in pharma earning good money, I would never hold that against them.

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","Side story: At GDC in San Francisco a few years ago, CCP Games (of Eve Online) was quietly handing out invitations to developers for an exclusive after-conference party, as a recruiting event.  This is the first and only time I've been invited to a cool party.

My work friends and I show up, it's like 10pm, at a cool club in SF that CCP had completely rented out.  The music was a custom mix of Eve's soundtrack, and the screens were showing gameplay.  Unlimited free drinks and snacks.  They had a great club atmosphere; perfect dark lighting, perfect music volume, good corners for talking, good seating, and so on.  It was absolutely amazing to be having a party with a bunch of developers.  We got to meet guys from other companies, talk shop, talk about CCP - incredible experience.

There were sexy waitresses going around serving drinks.  We got buzzed enough to start flirting with one.  Here comes the point of this story: CCP Games had ONLY hired people who were true gamers.  It wasn't flaunted, but as we started to talk with one friendly girl, turns out she was a huge WoW player, with a Warlock and as much experience as any of us.  Completely blew my mind.

IMB should take care of fire immune/highly-resistant enemies until you get Fire Storm, which is only 35% resistible.

As for distance, you really should melee some weaker enemies to try and build up Fighting skill and help remedy your fragility. However, you are so fragile that most things will destroy you in melee range faster than you can blink. Conjure Flame is very useful for holding things off in tight corridors, yes. Personally, I think getting in range for Sticky Flame is too risky with a Deep Elf. If you were going for a more Hybrid-y HEFE, then it would probably be worth it, but Deep Elves are just so damn fragile. Most things that are very fast aren't *too much* of a threat. Dogs (hounds, war dogs, jackals, etc) are pretty fast and hard hitting, but they don't have a ton of hp so you can blast them pretty easily. Imps... imps are a bitch, best to just lure them up one level, wait for them to blink, then proceed exploring as normal. Once you get Mystic Blast you can laugh them off, though. Later on, Orb Guardians are fast as fuck, but by then you can just Fire Storm their asses off. That's all the super fast monsters I can think of right now, but I'm probably missing a lot.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; Maybe a part of being a decent person always means to be constantly sad, often hopeless and at awe because a person like that sees everything clearly in all its ugliness.

On this planet, that certainly seems to be the case, unfortunately.  I do think that there are some humans that are sufficiently developed to be able to see the troubles and yet be able to rise above them, but that ability certainly doesn't apply to everyone.

&gt; The most puzzling thing, though at least for me, is that once in a while (granted rarely) you encounter a nice and decent human being who tries with all his might to ""live decently in an indecent world"".

I would actually say that *most* of us actually try to do this very thing.  This planet is a very difficult one, however, and often pushes many with even very good intentions to do very negative and counterproductive things.

&gt; if this planet is what you say it is, how come they ended up here?

I would say it's because a personality isn't ""all good"" or ""all bad"".  Inside even the worst of us, there is some good, and inside even the best of us, there is some bad.  In other words, there are souls that, even though they may be here because of some previous indiscretion or level of ignorance, they are *still* trying to do what they can to ""go toward the light"" so to speak.  As such, even those souls that deserve to be prisoners here try to do what they can to be granted their parole - and oftentime that includes learning to act in a more intelligent, selfless, and loving manner like the actions of the activist in Brazil which you described above.

As well, there are said to be certain, very advanced souls that purposefully incarnate here in order to help educate others.  Often, due to the great level of ignorance here, these souls *do* indeed meet with what appear to be very horrendous and untimely deaths.

&gt; how can a human race produce such monsters and such almost saints simultaneously? How is it even possible?

I think the answer to that lies in first realizing that it is not the human race itself that is responsible for producing anything.  The human race is the *effect* - not the cause.  The cause - i.e. the reason - behind our existence here lies in the ability of forces much stronger and more knowledgeable than you or I.  *They* are the ones in charge of who and what does or does not manifest and incarnate on this planet, and the decisions they make result in a mixture of different levels of development here.

This planet can be seen as a K-12 grade school in the cosmic ghetto.  As such, you *will* indeed get a lot of uneducated cretins.  You *will* get a lot of violent know-nothings.  However - and as is definitely the case in even the worse inner city schools - along with the throng of future criminals, you will also find brilliant and prodigiously talented kids that rise above the negativity.  This planet seems no different in that regard.

&gt; If human race is vile, then it should be homogeneously vile

and perhaps it *is* homogeneously vile.  Homogeny, however, still admits a certain level of discrepancy.  Homogeny does not mean ""completely"" or ""100%"".  It means ""overall"".  I think the conditions on this planet can easily make a race ""overall vile"" - yes - but all I have to do is look in the mirror to know that, for as much ignorance and asshole and jerk and fuckwad is in me, there is also at least as much love and compassion there as well; and since I know I am no different than anyone else, I also know that the same applies to you and everyone (regardless of how we may see them otherwise).

&gt; the tiniest minority is decent and trying to resist/actively counteract evil, and the rest are true psychopaths that are unfortunately always in position of power. This is something I cannot wrap my mind around.

Taking nothing away from the human capacity for ignorance and evil, I shall say that I am not certain that every being in a position of power on this planet is in fact a human at all.","1306886588"

So the problem we as Christians face is two fold:

1. The average Christian has no knowledge of the Bible as a BOOK.  Forget the whole Word of God aspect and study it as a really old book and learn how it was put together, when stuff was added to it, when stuff was removed, etc.  If the average Christian did this and was well versed in the history of the Bible as a work of literature then they could deal with problem #2.

2. To the average atheist zealot (I like atheists.  Any people that are willing to do good in the world without the belief in some eternal reward are pretty good people.  However, zealots of any religion/lifestyle/hobby disgust me) who argues the only proof that Jesus existed is in ONE book, the average Christian is ill prepared to defend their belief.  The atheist zealot has probably not studied the Bible in any detail, and I don't expect him/her to.  But the Christian that hasn't studied the Bible as a book can't explain how different books of the Bible and written by different people at different times, some at the same time, others years apart from each other.","1306886601"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Also the CBO has updated their numbers to 2007. Now why is that important? The Bush tax cuts are in the more current years. [http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=226](http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=226).

Good - now you see the taxes are progressive, with the rich carrying most of the tax base by total and by percentage. What tax rates would satisfy you? It seems you want to tax the rich more, even though they pay quite a bit. What amount is enough? The Bush tax cuts lowered everyones taxes. I agree we should undo them, and raise *everyone's* taxes.

&gt;I personally think we should have a corporate tax but I understand your point. The reason I think we need one is to modify corporate behavior.

We do have corporate taxes. They are given tax incentives to incentivize behavior, just like personal income taxes. There are also laws regulating behavior of both corporations and individuals. I don't understand your comment.

&gt;Having a few families with most of the money.

If you read the Congressional link I posted above you'll see estate taxes were instituted to finance wars, not to stop the rich. You'll also see empirical evidence that even though many people claim it is now used to stop the rich, it has little effect for that. Among the many studies on this claim comes the quote **""only about 2 percent of inequality was attributable to the unequal distribution of inherited wealth""**. Read the article, especially the part about inheritance taxes in practice. They do not do what you want them to do.

&gt;Again 5% of the population in the US holds 65% of all the wealth.

Do you think they took wealth that is somehow rightfully yours? If a doctor works hard and earns multiples of what the average person earns, did he take from the people? If an entrepeneur starts a business and it grows and he is wealthy, do I have a right to tell him to give me some? The reason few hold so much is only a few have the brains, work ethic, persistence, and drive to make new businesses. Of the 5% you mention (15 million people) how many do you think are doctors, lawyers, or own their own self-started business? They got rich because people paid them for things the people wanted. Now you claim the people should take the money back?

Since you ignored this last time, I repeat: show me how the lower groups ever catch up in total taxes by $ amount or by rate. If you cannot then you have to admit the rich pay more in taxes than any other group by both percentage and by total. If the rich already pay a disproportionate amount of taxes, and you want to raise their taxes, how much is enough? How do you know what the right rate is?

This does use the OS networking stack and shouldnt be an issue.

Doing anything except the localhost would require me to use a proxy class to handle whether I am playing MP or SP. This adds more effort.

My pastor is from Kentucky, has the accent, but is sort of presents rabbit-chasing, semi-academic sermons that are more circular than outright logical in progression and definitely not emotional. 

There's one time where I felt ""called out"" in a sermon but it was more of the content than the tone. 

The yelling, dramatic tone, I'm not used to. I mean, I went to camps with people from the South (Baptists from Alabama are my FAVORITE--to make fun of... is that bad?) and I heard some there. One time, in a bible study at camp we were all allowed to put one serious and one light-hearted question in a hat to address as a group anonymously. 

I put ""Why are southern people so loud (serious)?"".

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Certain subreddits are more karma-centric than others; this is especially true of the very large and generally less serious subreddits, like /r/pics. I know it's a cliche piece of advice, but abandon the larger subreddits (or at least come to peace with their karma-centric atmosphere) and look to smaller, higher quality subreddits for great discussion. /r/math and /r/physics, for example, have some of the most intellectually stimulating and pleasurable threads on reddit, and fit my own interests perfectly. Find similar smaller communities to fit your tastes.

This is all really a product of reddit becoming more popular, and if you want to avoid some of the negative effects that come with crowds, find smaller subreddits. There is a ton of really high quality content in these subreddits. What makes reddit different from any other message board is its ability to adapt to changes like this and maintain quality by allowing smaller communities to still flourish even when the larger communities are inundated with habits practiced by ""the mob"".

/r/pics is like pop music: it can be fun, but you should expect there to be some loss of quality when there's such a focus on mass appeal; smaller subreddits can replace them if you're looking for higher quality content and community. This is why the subreddit model succeeds.","1306886653"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Wow, a lot of talk about the back brake, but not a lot about the physics at play here.  Yes, both brakes, are important.  Yes the front brake is better than the rear.

When you’re riding along, both tires have about the same amount of traction (yes I’m simplifying here).

When you start to brake you apply, let’s say 50 percent of your full braking power front and rear.  That is to say 50 percent of what the lever is capable of.  As you do so, your weight will transfer forward.  As that happens your front tire gains traction, as it has more weight on it.  Awesome, that means you can begin to apply more front brake.  The bad news is that that weight is coming from somewhere, the rear tire; your rear tire now has less traction than it had before.  You need to brake less with your rear brake as the weight transfers forward.
Halfway through your braking maneuver, your front brake will be at 75 percent of what the lever can do, and the rear 25 percent.  This will transfer even more weight forward.

As you come to a stop, you can be applying much more front brake than you thought possible, and you should have pretty much stopped using the rear.

When I watch riders practicing this, usually the first time they come in and take this very gradual stop, applying 50 percent of the possible power with both levers and just holding it there.  As they continue to practice, they start using their front brake more and more effectively, they transfer more weight, and they start skidding their rear tire.  While they’re using the front more effectively, and moving more weight forward, they haven’t yet changed how they brake with their rear brake.  The really critical thing to notice is that the rear doesn’t start skidding right away, it starts skidding about halfway through the maneuver, when they’re still applying 50 percent of the force on the rear lever, but the weight transfers off the rear tire.

The point is to start slowly, don’t grab the front brake, squeeze it like you would a lemon.  As you do that, back off of your rear brake.

1. Girl in my class in 6th grade. Did not think she liked me, just thought she was cute and nice. She never found out I liked her.

2. Another girl from my class in 7th and 8th grades. Again, didn't think she liked me, I liked her because of mutual involvement in school plays or some weird shit like that. She probably knew I liked her. Nothing came of it then. Now I go to parties at her house a lot, I'd call her a friend. 

3. A girl two years older than me, during my freshman year. Didn't think she liked me, just thought she was attractive and I found her to be interesting (liked to talk about politics and stuff). I told her I liked her but nothing ever came of it. 

4. Yet another girl in my grade, during my sophomore year. The usual, thought she was cute and all, but didn't think she liked me. Went about things an awful way eliminating the minor chance I may have had with her. Either way, her and I are friends now.

5. A girl a year younger than me, early in my junior year. I had gotten to know her well, thought she liked me (and I wasn't the only one who thought that), and developed a liking for her mostly because of that. Her and I are good friends now. In fact, we're texting as I write this.

6. Another girl a year younger than me, now (late in my junior year). I don't think she likes me. Why do I like her? I just think she's really cute. 

**TL;DR: I have, but only really once.**","1306886663"

It's not like if shit hits the fan I can just go back move back home,  my dad passed away a few years ago and the rest of my family lives in south america. 

Although I am lucky to have my mom's support and I feel very lucky for that but the best should would be able to do would send a couple of 200 dollars every month which is alot of money in Paraguay but wouldn't go really fan in Canada, especially in Vancouver.  For me to survive I need a constant flow of income for rent, food etc. but it seems that if you want an actual career in something these days you must bite the bullet and take that unpaid internship which doesn't even guarentees a full time paying job without a year or so.

From late 1943 onwards the Germans in Italy and on the Western Front could barely step outside to take a piss without being strafed or bombed. If the Soviets had swept the Luftwaffe from the skies at the start and been able to bomb Germany at will, they would have had much more success much earlier. They still deserve enormous credit for taking the bulk of the German assault, certainly. The USA gets extra credit for fighting on two vastly different fronts across the world from each other while supplying the Allies with huge amounts of military equipment and supplies. They also saved Western Europe from communism. Both efforts were legendary.","1306886666"

Student loans are guaranteed by the federal government which is why theoverture specified them.  Also other people being delinquent as well doesn't excuse you from doing so.  Most people are delinquent because they seriously cannot afford them.  It seems to me that you can afford them (at least in the near term) and are deciding whether or not to pay them. ","1306886674"

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","A lot has already been said, and I applaud you for putting yourself out there to be critiqued. Painful as it may be, it's a great way to avoid developing bad habits.

My critique is a functional one, and very common among restaurant/nightlife websites: maximize the information that's presented on the main page. The main page here, as it is on most restaurant sites, is a high-level sales pitch for the restaurant. It doesn't really get around to telling me what kind of restaurant it is until the next to last sentence. I also probably already know everything presented there that would affect my decision.

When i go to a restaurant's website, I didn't get there by accident or directly from a search engine. Roughly 100% of the time, I am accessing the site via a link from some sort of review site (yelp, some food critic's individual review, etc.). I probably already want to go there. I already have most of the information that I want, but the site I'm coming from didn't have all of the information necessary to make a decision. Are they open? Can I get a seat? Is the menu likely to have changed for some reason (seasonal, daily, weekly, event)? So, now I'm going to the restaurant site to ""fill in the gaps"". I want to see hours and I want an address and phone number on the main page and god help you if I can't at least cut and paste them. Unless there are many locations, this doesn't take up much page space and it cuts down on nav bloat and unnecessary page loads. 

This isn't so severe for places that require reservations, particularly in a large city where you have no hope of obtaining one at the last minute, but I may not be in the most favorable conditions, internetwise, if I'm trying to get this information while I'm on the hoof. If I'm accessing the site from a mobile device with a weak signal or slow connection, the last thing i want to see is that I have to load yet another page to get the one line of information that I care about. If I'm out with friends and we are trying to decide where to go, we are likely performing similar searches in parallel and that restaurant just lost the race.","1306886686"

I've never been to the Edge Coffeehouse but if they can support our crowd I don't see any reason why we can't have at least one meetup there.  Of course whenever discussion of light rail construction comes up on this subreddit the general consensus seems to be that any business that dies because of the construction deserved it and is a small price to pay for ""progress.""  Maybe we don't want to support this guy because a giant apartment complex could be built in that coffee shop's place so the ""progress"" could be even greater.

You can also find out which one is negative by looking at the graphs.

If you can remember the identity: exp(i theta) = cos(theta) + i sin(theta), then just differentiate to get i exp(i theta) = cos'(theta) + i sin'(theta) and multiply by -i to get exp(i theta) = sin'(theta) - i cos'(theta) = cos(theta) + i sin(theta) which tells you that sin'(theta) = cos(theta) and -cos'(theta) = sin(theta) (which is the same as cos'(theta) = -sin(theta))","1306886690"

http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx

Gas has gone up 83% in the last 6 years (not 100%).  **But** 2005 is an outlier (at first I thought 6-years seemed too arbitrary a number until I saw the figures) so if you use a 5-year figure, gas prices have gone up only 35% in the last 5 years.  That's 35% total or about 6% per year.

Your estimates seem to use best-case scenarios.  Also, don't forget financing fees, unless you intend on paying cash ~$45,000 upfront.

This covered everything from Domain Registration and DNS setup to the installation and deployment the necessary software (DotNetNuke, ASPDotNetStorefront, etc) along with extensive on-site business and gov't/municipal IT support. However, since the economy pulled back, people have been curtailing their advertising budget - and if you want to talk about a business where chasing down the payments is nearly 50% of the job... yikes.

Anyway, so lost that job and a good 7+yrs of quality 'career time' - I'm 37 now. I spent about 1-2mos looking and was lucky enough to have a friend point me to a IT Position at a local communications company. Even though I'm extremely over-qualified for the position, I still needed about 1-2mos of training for my new duties - mainly hardware provisioning, first level IT support, and inventory control (working the warehouse)... it's not a glorious job, but it pays better than the last job, has WAAAY better benefits, opportunity for growth, and when I go home at the end of the day I get to just leave work behind (something I hadn't done for a loooong time and am appreciating the break).

Now, like myst1227 said - there's a high likelihood of flight when better opportunities present themselves (""The money is at the door""). However, a wise employer can often keep employees around by just keeping them happy (challenge them if they're bored, incentives, good atmosphere, opportunity for growth and/or education, etc).

Yes you put people into boxes and then discount their position because all people not in your box don't count.

&gt; Well, unless you consider the fact that I'm living in a safer house built to code designed to mitigate the risk of fire to be an example of tyranny.

Well I suppose you'll be the first volunteer to live their life according to some code made up  by government bureaucrats(FYI it's designed to bring the most wealth back to the politicians with the most influence, not make you healthy and happy)

&gt; Wild speculation

Because it's never happened before? Because the drug war in mexico is nothing really?

&gt;  Alcohol is taxed heavily. Cigarettes are taxed heavily because they're unhealthy.

You're so misguided it's painful to argue with you. Do you know what vice tax means? The reason alcohol and tobacco are taxed is because they were seen as immoral. It had nothing to do with health. Perhaps today that is the case, however this is not a good argument for healthcare since people who abuse those substances die earlier and end up costing far less in total healthcare. It's about control plain and simple.

&gt; ""Socialized medicine"" is just another form of regulation.

No, it is not.

&gt; The end result of socialized healthcare in the US is a healthier population.

Of course, back to the tyranny of good intentions.

&gt;  But, I don't consider the expansion of civil liberties and pulling back on services provided by the government to be the same thing.

How can it not be? Expanded services required expanded revenue.

&gt; If ""simple education"" sufficed, we wouldn't be having this discussion, would we?

Tell you what lets take all the money put towards entitlements and instead make it for education. No that's a terrible idea, it would lead to still more graft and corruption. How about instead all services provided by the government are contingent on passing a related test. Free courses are offered (and paid for those who can afford it)

Finally: 

&gt; There is no solution that will make everyone happy, but there are policies that work better for more people than others.

At this point, I'm overqualified for my job since I make it a point to expand my knowledge and job skills daily and I was 'qualified' on the day I was hired two years ago.  I was out of work for almost 2 months a few years ago and it WAS stressful, but I worked my whole network of friends/contacts and applied for a lot of jobs I certainly did not want to work.  Was the employment market different then?  Of course.  I moved to find a job I wanted and am always growing and maintaining connections to ensure I have options at all times just in case I am suddenly without a job.  

I never said it was easy.  I am saying it is very hard for me to believe that people simply cannot find a job.  If you're unemployed, you have a LOT of time to find work.  The problem is that it is very easy to play the waiting game (look for jobs, send resumes, follow up in a few days, wait, repeat) and justify sitting in front of the computer or watching tv instead of actively pursuing a job.  That's the reason it took me 2 months to actually find a new job.  Unemployment is actually pretty awesome if you don't consider paying the bills or eating anything other than Ramen.

EDIT: It just really gets on my nerves when unemployed people start implying that getting a job is just luck.  That is the first sign of resignation to your self-imposed station in life.  It's a way of rationalizing why you're in the state you're in while choosing to remain in that state.

"space","t5_2qh87","Sorry guys, but this is absolutely, positively, 100% fake. This is from a BBC simulation for a documentary they did a long time ago, and the Apollo 11 moonwalkers absolutely did not see or film the *Luna 15* probe as it passed overhead while they were on the lunar surface. If you are at all familiar with the Apollo 11 TV camera system used during that mission, it is easy to tell just looking at this video that this is definitely not authentic *Westinghouse* Lunar TV camera footage we are seeing there. It is just a BBC sim shot on Earth on a sound-stage.

*Luna 15* was a last ditch unmanned effort by the Soviets to upstage the Americans by returning a small sample of the Moon to Earth before the Apollo 11 crew could get back. *Luna 15* was launched a week before Apollo 11, and was designed so that the unmanned lander would touch down in *Mare Crisium* at the same time Armstrong and Aldrin were on the lunar surface at *Mare Tranquillitatis*, over 1000 kms away. After touchdown, the *Luna 15* unmanned lander would then scoop up a small sample of lunar surface material, drop it into a transport cask, and then the small capsule return rocket would blast off from the Moon and return the sample to Earth. If all worked as planned, the *Luna 15* sample would beat the Apollo 11 crew and their samples back to Earth by a few hours.  

Unfortunately for the Soviets, *Luna 15* crapped out shortly after it began automated descent and the lander ended up smacking into the lunar surface in *Mare Crisium* at unsurvivable speed, destroying the lander and ending the Russkies efforts to beat the Apollo 11 crew back to Earth with samples of the lunar regolith.

According to the official historical record of Apollo 11, the crew never saw or filmed the *Luna 15* probe at any point during their mission. This footage is just not real.  ","1306886744"

They were just making shit up. Booga Booga. 

Smedly Butler said it best nearly 100 years ago: 

    ""War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small 'inside' group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.""

In another often cited quote from the book Butler says:

    ""I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916.

Just to clarify, the appleTV Plex client is great for what it is: a jailbroken app on a device without an official API.  The install process is cumbersome, and it's definitely still in beta form; however, if you have an appleTV, jailbreaking and installing Plex is a no-brainer.

I've also never tried the relatively new Roku Plex client; however, I wouldn't assume it's the same experience as the AppleTV client since I assume you can install it without jailbreaking your device.  The officially supported install method (and presumably the official API) could make it drastically different in its current form.

Also, what problems did you have getting PleXBMC running?  I just downloaded the latest version and had it running (on the same machine) within 10 minutes.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","I disagree with your first sentence.  Had he wanted to, President Obama could've pursued gun control (instead of health care reform), trotted out a bunch of injured cops and deceased cops wives, and passed a bill similar to the Clinton ban through the Democratic congress in 2009.  It seems to me that while he FEELS strongly about gun control, he thinks other issues are far more important.  Of course I have no real way of knowing this, however, he only speaks of gun control when he's with people who see the worst part of guns.  The examples I'm referring to are his meeting w/ Brady and the press conference w/ Calderon. 

Also, while Running_Bear does accurately quote the president, he doesn't mention that President Obama didn't actually say ANYTHING about gun control in the prepared speech, it was only after he was pressed during the Q&amp;A.  Also, the rest of his response doesn't really seem to threatening to me...

&gt;PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, we did discuss this extensively in our meetings. I have not backed off at all from my belief that the gun -- the assault weapons ban made sense. And I continue to believe that we can respect and honor the Second Amendment rights in our Constitution, the rights of sportsmen and hunters and homeowners who want to keep their families safe to lawfully bear arms, while dealing with assault weapons that, as we now know, here in Mexico, are helping to fuel extraordinary violence -- violence in our own country, as well.
Now, having said that, I think none of us are under any illusion that reinstating that ban would be easy. And so, what we've focused on is how we can improve our enforcement of existing laws, because even under current law, trafficking illegal firearms, sending them across a border, is illegal. That's something that we can stop.
And so our focus is to work with Secretary Napolitano, Attorney General Holder, our entire Homeland Security team, ATF, border security, everybody who is involved in this, to coordinate with our counterparts in Mexico to significantly ramp up our enforcement of existing laws. And in fact, I've asked Eric Holder to do a complete review of how our enforcement operations are currently working and make sure that we're cutting down on the loopholes that are resulting in some of these drug trafficking problems.
The last point I would make is that there are going to be some opportunities where I think we can build some strong consensus. I'll give you one example, and that is the issue of gun tracing. The tracing of bullets and ballistics and gun information that have been used in major crimes -- that's information that we are still not giving to law enforcement, as a consequence of provisions that have been blocked in the United States Congress, and those are the areas where I think that we can make some significant progress early.
That doesn’t mean that we're steering away from the issue of the assault guns ban, but it does mean that we want to act with urgency, promptly, now. And I think we can make significant progress.","1306886802"

Sometimes the best way to attain your goals is through not trying so hard to attain them. I'm happy being alone, and I will continue to stay happy. I think I'm in a much better position than someone who's desperately chasing down every possible lead.

Wanting things badly that you can't have = unhappiness. You can choose to be happy by not being so fixated on a few goals. For instance, you may be happier with more social status, but striving after social status generally makes you miserable.

Auto-ISO is one of the stronger features of Nikon cameras, it's on all their DSLRs and some of their point-and-shoots.

It operates exactly as the parent poster described: you set the minium shutter speed that you want, then the maximum allowable ISO.

It's not legal everywhere in the US. In fact, most states have restrictions on all forms of gambling. But some states have expressly forbidden online gambling, including poker.

&gt; what exactly does electronic transferring of funds mean.

Just a few years ago, electronic funds transfer was lightly regulated. Now it's a ridiculous disaster of regulations making it almost impossible to follow the law unless you have an army of lawyers, and deep pockets.

&gt; That makes no sense to even have online poker legal if there is absolutely no way they can transfer funds...

It was the easy way (boo! terrorism!!) to regulate online gambling sites (run by international companies), some of which may have been set up to launder money.

There's a park by my high school that's really close in walking range. So I'd always go there, but there would be a lot of park security around (for drug use prevention and so on). So one day we see the park security van drive down the road near where me and my friends were sitting, and one of us gets the bright idea to shout ""Fuck, hide your weed!"". The car jolts to a stop, and then we get the idea we're about to get fucked (as a stoner/wannabe gangster was with us). Everybody was good friends with each other, but we got up, and ran the fuck down the field as fast as we could to a tunnel at the back at the park. We hid for a good hour. Supposedly, a friend walking towards us saw the security guards chase and look for us for about 30 minutes.
TLDR; about to get interrogated and (possibly) arrested by park police for the (possible) possession of weed, then ran to safety at a nearby car dealership.

Context: We knew a man who worked as park security that was really nice and always gave us stickers on Wednesday (bitches love stickers). We always joked around with him, hence the outburst. What we didn't know that it wasn't him. Whoops.","1306886819"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;My general rule for a conclusive answer on the internet is an undeniable source or citation, and/or a consensus response from several individuals. That lowers the chance that you have one person that could easily be wrong, or lying. (Not that I have any reason to think that about the responder on r/askreddit, just a general assumption that I make.)


Consensus on the internet doesn't show what is right. Most people on the internet don't know much at all about the law. I gave a bunch of examples that have to do with what constitutes state sponsorship of religion as well as cases that highlight what does not because those are the things that are considered in court rulings. Precedents don't rely on exactly the same court case but on aspects of court cases.

Further, citing the ACLU is not the same thing as citing what is and what is not legal. By their nature they have to be contrary to many things and will pursue things whether or not precedent has been established. The EEOC does protect you from needing to participate. The problem with your interpretation is you seem to think you are forced to participate by being there. It may be a required part of your job to attend the meeting, however a principal engaging in prayer is not forcing you to participate. Consider that you want him to stop as a condition of employment.

The cases I cited cited very specific things that stand or fall together. If a court rules 5 things constitute a violation and you show up with three things, it isn't a a violation.

&gt;Edit: If I did commit karma jacking, it wasn't intentional on my part. I'd have posted it in r/atheism if I had wanted to do that. LOL

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Ok the first push you make at 10 minutes, you make this because you really over prepared for some sort of 6 gate or 5 gate robo timing. If you look at this point his army is 30 supply behind but your drones and probes are only 6 different. A lot of your supply is tied up in your army and when he force fields you off you lose all of that supply you had tied into that roaches, it also costs you 400 minerals (1200 to you and you did 800 damage so cutting the difference). Now your 6 drone lead is being cut into as he constantly just produces them 2 by 2 and you still mass roaches. This over abundance of roaches is simply due to lack of map presence. You don't have either of the Xelnaga towers with your lings and you don't have any overlords or zerlings by any of the expansions or in the middle of the map (there is a space on xel naga where you can nicely position an OL in the middle). 

Taking a look then at the mid game (15 minutes is when he gets his 3rd so we'll take it from then) you have a 6 drone deficit and 45 roaches. Now although roaches are a good unit, having your whole army composed of them is a sure fire way to get killed. Look at his army comp, stalker, sentry and immortal the perfect composition to counter your roaches (which at the 15 minute mark are tied in upgrades at 1/1 and robo units generally get a much better bonus from upgrades). When he took his 3rd you at least have both xelnaga towers, so you could consider splitting his forces, drops, nydus run bys (on xel naga worse players won't block the back of the base, allowing for easy ling harass). This is just a petite thing, but you can also keep your army active, from 12:00 to 16:00 your roach ball just sits on the natural. Try clearing your gold rocks, pushing the front (if you do this carefully you can burn sentry energy just don't over extend).

The fight at 16 minutes is an interesting one, you have so much tech yet you haven't used any of it, you have 2 evo chambers an infestation pit, a hydralisk den, a roach warren, spire all on 2 base! 3 bases couldn't even support all of that if you're using the units. You hold off the attack but that was a common problem day 9 listed in one of his dailies not to long back, the daily in particular was of Sen vs a protoss (I cannot find the game unfortunately). The basic premise of the problem is that zerg gets these basic units to start, the roach and the hydralisk, they're a good mid game army but as you hit late game and the protoss gets immortals colossus and void rays they really just don't make the cut. You need to start transitioning into infestors, broodlords, ultras and banelings against certain compositions. 

Obviously at 18 minutes you make the right call to an extent, you need to push and try to stop his 3rd going up, a few things that would help. The tech mentioned earlier, drops or run bys during the fight, creep spread (hydras are bad but without creep they're simply worthless). Coming out of the fight you produce 16 corruptors, now note up until they point you have seen 1 colossus. Now granted your greater spire is nearing completion, but look at your money - 350 : 5. You literally went into overkill on the corruptors, cutting that number back to 5-6 would mean you could actually get some broodlords and drones :p.

21 minutes the protoss takes a 4th, now this is mega oh shit moment for you. Watch any high level ZvP and you know if a protoss gets a safe comfortable 4th that you're in trouble. 8 gas is enough to do a lot of things for a protoss. But unfortunately you can't abuse any terrain as you've stuck to the roach hydra corruptor mix, and due to your over production of corruptors you're only able to make 3 broodlords (and he already has blink stalkers). He pushes you at just the right time before your broodlords hit and your roach hydra just melts under the colossus stalker mix. Due to being 40 drones behind your simply can't do the standard 300 supply army and from here the game just snowballs. 

Look at some of the tabs at the end: Units lost you lost 7k more, and 155 units, with zerglings thats somewhere in the region of 100 larvae, that could be so many things, but instead its money down the drain :(.
Drones, he almost doubles you! Income showing the same thing.

Really your game can be fixed in a few key ways, first of all:

Scouting, you made so many roaches at the beginning but you never actually used them to any effect, all they did was cut into your drone count. If you're ever unsure as a zerg just make defense til you're comfortable and then drone up (you can catch up very quickly with an inject over 2 hatcheries giving you 10+ drones a time).

Harass, you can cut into your workers heavily if you do the same to him, lings in the back door, drop tech, nydusses, baneling mines, hell even zergligns under expos are all ways to just slow him down and cut into his late game army.

Finally don't go into an over the top macro sense, just take the information you're given and make an educated assessment, you saw 1 colossus in your fight and you made 16 corruptors! If you're unsure you can sacrifice 2-3 overlords to scout the base and/or army, 300 minerals isn't much to pay when compared to 2000+ mineral and gas.

Anyway I'm sorry for the wall of text and I hope some of it helps, if I find the daily I'll make sure to link it in here. Anyway good luck, for the swarm and all that \o/

"wow","t5_2qio8","As a holy paladin (speaking from a holy priest perspective) your main priority is tanks. As much as the devs have tried to make all classes suitable for all roles, paladins are still most used for tank healing. 

Therefore keep the tanks alive and people will stay happy (hopefully - some people are hard to please!). Oh and read up on any tacts. For Cho'Gall make sure to agree between other healers who will be healing the Cho'Gall tank while adds are up.

Trash for BoT is pretty easy. The two large trash mobs after the Twin Drakes make an AoE on the ground which is easily visible. It will appear as dots in loads of places (a bit like Magmaw) and you get a couple of seconds to get away. I've seen loads of people die on that. Most other trash has nothing you need to worry about as a healer. 

Halfus is very healing intensive at the start. Don't be afraid to burn most of your mana for the first minute or so of the fight while the raid takes down adds. Apart from that just follow tacts on wowpedia/wowhead/(site of your choice).

Twin Drakes - Valiona - Dispel the debuff as soon as people are grouped up. The sooner it is dispelled the less damage it will deal, although the total damage dealt when dispelled is shared between everyone within a small range (10yd?) of the target - hence grouping up.
Theralion - Group up with ranged and follow them wherever they go. Look to see where Valiona is using her 'Deep Breath' like ability which will cover 1/3 the room. Someone will likely call out which side for you, if not just make sure you're looking out for it!

Twilight Council - Trash - Stay out of AoE.
Council - As a healer you have the easiest job here by far. Just keep people alive in ph1. In ph2 get the correct buff to avoid the specific raid-wide AoE that will kill you if you have the wrong buff. In ph3 make sure to stay in range of tanks and avoid puddles.

Cho'Gall - Avoid anything that appears on the floor. As mentioned earlier agree with your raid who is healing the Cho'Gall tank during adds. Ph2 is often very healing intensive, though this is no reason not to keep everyone alive in ph1 as it is predominantly a dps race (kill the bad guy before everyone gets full corrupted blood and dies - though tentacles will kill you before that).

I'd put gonewilding somewhere around the level of blatantly ogling women on the street. Assuming it's passive, it borders on the disrespectful, but not on infidelity.

Drunk dude was in a dance off with big guy in the green when big dude dances up and just shoves him for no good reason.  Drunk dude starts of dancing and yelling about something we don't have info about and becomes more and more aggressive in posture with every shove from the big dudes until he snaps and hits the guy.  At one point the big dude throws him on the ground for whispering something in his ear, really?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is probably too buried for people to see, but here are some of my counter-arguments against legalization.

1. People say that it will help the economy because it will be taxable. This is greatly exaggerated. If it were legalized, two things would happen. The price would plummet because more people would be willing to sell it, and less people would buy it because it is so easy to grow (I know I would just grow it if there were no legal ramifications). So all in all, there would be very little in the way of economic benefits.

2. People say that if people want to smoke now they can, and if it were legalized it could be regulated and made safer (this is assuming the number of users wont go up). This argument ignores the massive social stigma that comes with something being illegal. If pot was legalized, that would essentially be the government saying ""yea, this drug is totally fine for you,"" so many more people would use it. So long as you agree that pot is at least a little bit bad for your health (as most people do), legalization would have an obvious negative effect on society.

Those are just a few of the arguments that I have, but I'm going to stop now so as to not bore you. Personally, I think the USA should adopt much more relaxed punishments for possession (my home city Ann Arbor has a $25 fine for possession, for example), but not legalize it. ","1306886856"

* There are a lot of assholes in the world that will walk on whoever they can.  Unfortunately that most frequently ends up being the best people; who take on everything they possibly can and always do their best.

* Some people will lash back, ""what are you fucking kidding me, I can't do that"", whereas people in your situation will say ""yeah I'll see what I can do"".  The problem goes back to assholes; they will always pile more stuff on you as long as you say ok.

* I think you just have to realize when you're being walked on.  I would simply state that you have something personal you need to deal with (I dunno, big breakup, a friend that needs your help; something that can't be verified true or false), and that you can only work the hours you're scheduled.

* Don't decline any new responsibilities, just say that you are busy, have a lot on your mind, and will address everything as soon as you can get to it.  This is a firm but non-belligerent way of setting your ground rules.

* Put your resume out there.  No further comment.

I have seen a lot of great people come and go in the companies I've worked for, and I've seen a bunch of assholes come and stick.  A lot of time, the 'great people' that have a lot on their plates leave behind a lot.

What you are primarily worried about, I'm afraid, is kind of inevitable.  I knew a lot of people that did 100x more good than anyone recognized them for, and when they left, there was only the void.

Most likely, you will leave such a void.  Just make sure you save/backup all your emails, take a ton of screenshots, and save everything you have.  If you're really making that much of a difference, you can take it to someone that will credit you for it.

The way we've been playing, a first level edge isn't going to become obsolete with time, but it will probably grow in strength. The game isn't about hours of reading, character tweaking/power leveling, it's about ""fast furious fun!"".

  2. It shots like this, it is often useful to have an assistant at the other end to provide the silhouette of a human figure, even if tiny. Memorable pictures tend to have a human form in them someplace. As is, while striking, it is not especially memorable.
  3. the cloudy texture in the floor: if an added special effect, it works poorly. If it is left over buffing marks, the this is a flaw in the site, and you'll need to see if you can find a way to use them to advantage. 
  4. The white triangle at the end is totally blown out. Texture there would be nice. Probably need a second exposure to bring that in.
  5. The orange outside building fades out, this can be brought in line so that it retains its color throughout. This will contribute to the overall effect.
  6. Sky - tends to go towards being blown out as you approach the center. some sort of texture, such as intermittent clouds, would be very nice.

If he can quit stabbing at the puck with his glove-hand, he may develop into a decent Manny Fernandez-type (An average-to-above-average goalie good enough to take you deep in the playoffs, but not someone who has what it takes to win it all on a year-to-year basis).  He's always got a smile on this face and it's hard not to be on his side in his battle for everyday NHL work.

I know who WON'T be starting: J-S Giguere or Jonas Gustavsson.  Giguere will go to free agency on July 1st and I wouldn't be surprised if the Leafs tried to run Gustavsson through waivers at some point this summer.  If he gets to the Marlies without getting claimed then great, but if he's claimed by another team, we'd lose him for good.  Regardless, I'd be surprised if either of them was still on the roster on opening night.  I think a Reimer-Scrivens combo should at least get a chance to start the season.

Another option is free agency.  Ilya Bryzgalov, Tomas Vokoun &amp; Dwayne Roloson are just a sampling of goaltenders who look poised to test the free agent market this summer.","1306886879"

It was no industry study, but a study by one of the most popular nature conservation organisations in Germany ([Link to the english webpage](http://www.nabu.de/en/index.html)) 

The good thing about the hydro-storage is, that you nearly don't loose energy. Because you regain the energy you lost by pumping the water in the upper lake, by letting it flow back (down) through the turbines. 

You might be right that in some areas the hydro-storage lakes might effect the nature negativly, or worse destroy it. But i think that depends in the realization. Here in Germany for example we have the fortune that there are many lakes suitable for this purpose, and they are mostly embeded in the nature. That also explains why we already have about 30-40 storage lakes. 

And since Norway (and also other scandinavian countrys) have always used this concept to produce and to store their energy, i would say it seems to function very good. 
But you are right, if nothing of the infrastructure is given (by the inviroment), it might take a lot of time to get things working.","1306886888"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","So what you're saying is that because life has no inherent morality we have no place attempting to make it a less brutal and disgusting thing than it already is? And your points about ""Mother Nature"" don't even jive with your idea of the world. If the world isn't fair or unfair, since ""morality is not black and white"", then this ""Mother Nature"" is not always trying to kill us, it simply is.

For not meaning to draw a comparison that is *exactly* what you do. And if you think we needed to subjugate natives so we could survive you're even more heinously mistaken. We (white males in power) needed to subjugate natives so we could get rich. It's been shown time and again that it's all we give a shit about. We even move natives from reservations already established, some even doing fairly well, because that land ends up having uranium or is good for growing cotton or grazing cattle or any of the other things the sick fucks think it's their manifest destiny to do.

In any case, if there is no place for morality in nature then how, pray tell, did humans evolve morality as a mechanism for survival in groups? Does this, humans, a part of nature, evolving morality naturally, not contradict your statement? 

At any rate I reject wholesale the notion that man exists to survive and take from his neighbor what might enrich him. All the other animals might do it but I have the benefit of a highly evolved brain, a full frontal lobe even, and believe that it is my duty to use this brain to better the life of not only myself but the lives of my fellows. These fellows include any human, even those callous ones such as yourself.

From the meaninglessness of life I create my own. I see the struggle of many and wish to reduce it that all humans may some day live in peace. It will not be realized in my lifetime or perhaps any lifetime but I can only hope to advance a rather Nietzschian project of preparing the way for those to come.","1306886890"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I did it for three months. It was the by-product of contract work, and mismanagement, I had read about it before and implemented a variation out of necessity. Almost everyone I was working with did, but a couple people couldn't seem to operate on such little sleep. The first week or two were miserable and driving was probably really dangerous.

Basically, I would sleep from 11 until about 1:30, and take a 15 - 20 minute nap in the middle of the day, and sometimes two. One day a week I would sleep as long as I could but I would usually wake up after about 6 hours.

Like I said, after 2 weeks I started to feel normal to better than my previous sleep schedule, but I may have also been easier frustrated. I noticed that others I was working with seemed to have a shorter temper. 

It's been about 5 years, but sometimes I feel like my body tries to go back to that sleep schedule, but I'm miserable when it happens.

Maintaining an iron man schedule requires a serious commitment. You pretty much need to fall asleep and wake up at the same time every night, then take your nap at pretty much the same time. Caffeine and alcohol are pretty much off limits too. My body adopted the sleep schedule as it's natural cycle but it only took two nights of binge drinking in about a month to throw it off. I'd imagine that getting sick would be similar to drinking too.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In my home town there was a town square with an old hotel about a block away. The building was an abandoned seven stories tall hotel that had burnt in the mid 1910's. It was still structerly sound, and was in the process of being restored. 

At the time the building was completely stripped. No windows, wiring, or elevator(there was a shaft). My buddies and I got the bright idea to throw off an old broken tv off the roof just to be little shits. [This style TV](/http://www.craftycrafty.tv/assets_c/2009/02/fish-tv-thumb-410x308-78536.jpg ""Except ours was bigger, and wasn't a fish tank"")

So we sneak it over a fence, and carry it up all seven flights of stairs to the rooftop. We decide at the last second that it would be awesome if we threw off a flaming TV. So one of my friends pours paint thinner all over it and lights it. As we push it off I see a cop car pull up to a stop sign very close to the old hotel.

From the cops angle, he had a front row seat to watch a large flaming tv hit the ground. As soon as it the tv hits the ground his light go on, and he pulls up to the TV which was on the opposite side of the hotel our entrance was on. We immedialty realize he is down there, and we take off down the stairs. I flew down those stairs faster then I have ever gone down stairs. We get down to the ground floor and climb over the fence. After that it was a dead sprint back to my house making sure that I stayed out the cops line of sight.","1306886900"

Their nature was a result of the Overmind being programmed to destroy all life. They are free of that but are being controlled by brood mothers of varying ideas of what to do with the broods.  It's also worth nothing that even in two previewed levels, Kerrigan is still a bit of a fierce bitch.    

What I meant was, the races aren't completely good or evil as a race.  Good humans (Raynor), bad humans (Mengsk). Same with the warring Protoss factions such as the high templars superiority complex in SC.  The Zerg arc now is similar to the Orc arc that culminated with Grom freeing them from the demon bloodlust curse.  The zerg, now nearly decimated and scattered, have to unite and find their place in the universe and Kerrigan has to wrest control back for them to do so.  

Former enemies uniting against a common ""black"" is a common theme, especially in Blizzard games.  Just as Warcraft had the Burning Legion, SC2 has the Xel'naga.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Above all you have no idea about how criminal justice works.

Central question in this case: When can you be held responsible for a deed you committed?

Someone mixes a drug into your (non alcoholic) drink. You suddenly pass out in the driver's seat and steer your car into a school bus. According to your answer, you should be held responsible and go to jail for that. After all you should have just controlled the effects of the drug and held your malfunctioning brain in check!

No?

Someone mixes a drug into your drink. You are in a state of confusion, fear, hallucinating wildly and can't think straight. Then you attack someone. Obviously you should have just controlled the effects of the drug. You are guilty for all the consequences. Because you obviously could just have returned to normal, if you only just wanted it enough.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","&gt;ACC's workplace accident compensation scheme will be opened up to private competition from October next year, the Government said today. 
....
&gt;Among the proposals is an extension to more employers of the Accredited Employer Programme from April next year.”
 
 
The company for whom I work, have been on this programme for a while now.  It is quite a good system in my opinion. The company pays a much lower ACC levy, and has to foot the bill for any costs incurred for injuries to workers. I have no idea what the current requirements are for a company to qualify for this scheme, but I imagine it is only available to pretty large companies.
 
 I sit on the Health and Safety Committee, and it is something the company takes very seriously. There is massive funding for H&amp;S, as it is in their best interests to reduce the costs associated with injuries around the workplace.
 
We have monthly site inspections done by members of the committee, and we also meet monthly to discuss issues that have arisen over that period. Any issue that is raised by anyone is investigated thoroughly, and the “eliminate, isolate, minimise” strategy is applied to all risks. We have a very low accident rate as a company, and it costs the company a hell of a lot less by spending money preventing accidents rather than treating them.
 
I know some people are against the privatisation of ACC as it means less money is spent on treatment; however if money is spent on making a workplace safer rather than treating injuries then I’m all for the scheme.

The figure we encounter in the gospel stories is a little higher than subsistence level. Also, there's always an issue that Marxian historians try to idealise Jesus as a proletarian voice of the marginalised and oppressed. While Jesus most definitely had his eyes on the poor and orphaned and persecuted, I don't think of his program as egalitarian, I think that this is a weird anachronistic idealism that some scholars, notably John Dominic Crossan, Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza and Gerd Theissen, have read into the data. There seems to be a bit of an ideological motivation at hand to somehow ""save"" earliest Christianity from sounding ""mythological"" or from it believing something that we may call weird or strange. I think it's better to anticipate the alien nature of the historical Jesus and note that while contemporary Western culture may not believe his mythology any-more, Jesus most definitely did believe his own myth.","1306886931"

Here's three quick steps to getting your own experience:


1. Start a blog on the topic/industry you want to get into. Sure, it's not much, but you'll get a far better understanding of the industry, issues and major people/companies in the industry than if you did nothing. Sometimes you just need to take the initiative and show you're doing one or two things that thousands of other applicants aren't.


2. Go Pro with your blog and register it as a website (through someone like wordpress) and interview the people in the industry you want to work for when you have at least three months of content on your website. You will then have the name, business card, and a direct relationship with the people, and within the companies you want to be involved with. You never know where that might go. After the interview has been published, ask them if they wouldn't mind catching up for lunch/coffee etc in a month or so, and then hit them up about opportunities.


3. Volunteer your time to charities and other non-profits that are related to your field. NFP's and charities are ALWAYS crying out for help, donate your time and you never know who you might run in to, meet, etc. Even if you don't meet anyone, after just six months you will have a professional reference from an organisation to put on your resume.

You just need to stand out from the crowd. Think outside the box and maybe even think about looking outside the country for experience.","1306886951"

Somewhat crazy story? Sure thing..

Basically we recently (this tuesday.. a week ago from now.) went out to a bar, me and my closest set of friends (we're a bunch of 5 guys and 1 uber-hot-girl... in total.) suddenly in a minute of boredom me and the girl starts squeezing eachother to see who is the strongest, I'm genuily impressed by her arms, I did however say that my breasts are way stronger than hers.
""Here, just feel, nothing but muscles."" (I know how silly it is, and this is so out of my character that everyone completely got it, including her.) But she got a good feel, then the tables were turned when she said ""Now you feel mine and we can compare.""

It ended up that we for a full 20 minutes feel eachothers breasts, outside, inside shirt / bra etc etc, while all our friends watch in amazement what the fuck we are doing.

Fast forward an hour later, she goes home, we move places and sits down with a group of 5 girls, small table, but we have loads of chairs, but I decided that fuck sitting behind someone on a chair, so when one of the girl stands up and bends over to listen more closely to what her friend is saying I sneak in under and steal her chair, she sat down, realized that I'm there and said ""Oh wow, aren't you a clever one?"" Well ofcourse I am, I'm sitting here and you're not aren't I?

We start talking.. Basically this girl does NOTHING but discuss her own breasts, how large they were and that no, they were infact not operated, she's very happy about them etc etc... Basically her whole personality was about her breasts.. This too ends up with me being literally FORCED to feel them up and guess size, guess weight, guess fucking everything, in the middle of this she says to one of her friends. ""It was such a long time ago someone touched me like this."" I was freaked out by how desperate she sounded.. I pushed her away, she played it of by bending forward and talking to her friend... Now my friend on the other side of the table decided that ""Hey, what if I put my foot up the other side of the table and carefully caress her buttom to get me into 'trouble', said and done he did.. Didn't really end up in me getting in trouble, I was more or less forced to keep doing what I never did in the first place...

And now, I got two rules when it comes to sex..
Never put your dick in someone who is drunker than you, and never put your dick in crazy... I decided she was a perfect case of the second rule and decided that she was a no-go.

He did nothing to help the minor league teams that feed into the NHL, so the team had fewer players growing into NHL careers and fewer prospects to make solid trades. It was finally turning around after Waddell was promoted (!) and the GM job was given to someone else. Winnipeg will be getting a nice young team that is getting better.

"Rift","t5_2s4an","On the subject of Call of Spring... sadly, it doesn't increase healing caused by Lifegiving Veil. That leaves it only increasing the healing from Bloom and Flourish.

Essentially you have five ""extra"" points to spread around that you can spend on survival or healing (though you have to be sure to get 32 in Chloro).

You could grab Neddra's Essence and/or Shadow Life if you want the extra safety. You could grab Raised in Nature if you feel you need the extra hit points (note: once you have good gear, this will give you more hp-per-point than Vitality). I'm comfortable enough with raid buffs and five stacks of Searing Vitality up that I don't feel the lack of those. If I really need to I can use a healing potion in a pinch since it's almost impossible for a Chloro to run out of mana.

For healing you can grab Call of Spring or Circle of Life, aka +15% healing on Flourish/Bloom or +25% crit chance on Flourish/Bloom. If I'm using Flourish, then the raid is somehow in trouble. I want that Flourish to crit so that the healing gets back on track. In fact, I want it to crit so badly that I've macroed [Insignia of the Deep](http://rift.zam.com/en/item/A9908ABB0601010101/Insignia-of-the-Deep) onto it. Between gear, raid buffs, that trinket, and Circle of Life I basically have a 70% chance to give the raid almost a full heal.

Damage for consistency, crit for burst. If I'm using Flourish/Bloom, I want burst.

That's the way I play Chloro. Other people use Flourish/Bloom as a normal thing; for them, taking Call of Spring instead of Circle of Life makes sense.

---

On the subject of Neddra's Influence, you have the following DoTs:

* Withering Vine
* Nature's Corrosion via Vile Spores
* Nature's Corrosion via Ruin (which stacks with the one from Vile Spores)
* Corrosion if needed
* Wild Growth if needed
* Mortality if needed to save yourself or help with AoE dps
* Devouring Shadows if needed to help with AoE dps
* Dark Touch if needed to help with single-target dps

That's a lot of DoTs. The first three in particular matter: the first two should almost always be active and the third is active much of the time.

---

On the subject of Elementalist, compare +5% crit to the +40 Str/Dex/Wis/Int and +50 End from Archon. Archon wins the third soul hands down.

---

On the subject of Neddra's Torture, the simple fact is that you have better places to put your points and usually better things to do with the cooldown required to cast it. Spec-wise, look at what I have: what would you sacrifice to get +3% damage that you have to spend a cooldown every 20 seconds to cast?

Also, I'm not sure if it stacks with the increase in magic damage taken from Bard or Archon. I haven't tested it, but I suspect it doesn't.

---

On the subject of your NecroLock build, there's a lot of customization that can be done with NecroLock, and it's largely ""to each his own"". That said, there are a couple of things I would definitely change.

First, Clattering Bones. The Necromancer tank can't hold aggro for crap and you can't keep it healed indefinitely, so there's really no situation to ever use it. The small buffs from Clattering Bones don't help anywhere near enough to make the Necro tank useful.

Second, Neddra's Grasp/Radiate Death. The short version is that it's a waste of a global cooldown. Any other DoT you have does more damage and the same is true of a Void Bolt. Even with Radiate Death specced, it's not worth using compared to Grave Rot, Devouring Shadows, Mortality, or (if nothing else) a quick bit of Soul Purge.

Other than those, you've made solid decisions. The only other thing to look at is getting Defile from 38 points in Warlock via getting Improved Void Bolt and something else. Those dramatically increase your single-target dps, making NecroLock viable as a dungeon dps spec if the fight has specific needs (e.g. a purge is needed, or there's a huge amount of constant movement, or you'll have to be keeping yourself alive, or... you get the idea).

Nevertheless, I am pretty sure ATI performance and stability are not that bad. F15 is somewhat unstable and does not seems to play well with proprietary drivers. I would go with Ubuntu or SUSE witch actually are the targets for every catalyst driver release.

nVidia does a better job at this point, they release a new driver for each new kernel and/or X.org version (they don't target distros!), and you or your distro can recompile some parts of the driver that interface with the kernel, giving you a much better support, even though you do get a binary blob after all.","1306887015"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Were you following the revolution in Egypt? Throughout the protests, the military didn't intervene and actually protected the civilians when the regime's police got violent. That's why they retained support from the populace and are in power right now

Wow you're naive.  The military is in power because they have the guns and nobody can force them to leave.  The protesters wanted an interim government led by someone like El Baradei, and wanted the entirety of the former regime dismantled and the emergency law repealed.  They got basically none of that.  [After Mubarak stepped down the military tried to clear the square with force](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/20114921821599558.html), killing at least 1 person and injuring around 70.   [They attempted to clear the square again ~2 days later with similar tactics.](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/20114121849525309.html)

You're right that the military didn't fire on the protesters when Mubarak was in power.  [But they did try to clear the square as early February 13th, long before Mubarak's ouster.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12442270)  It can't be said that the military was on the side of the protesters, they just knew they couldn't get away with a full on massacre.  If they had simply massacred the protesters they faced the existential threat of losing their US military aid.  So they basically decided to remain neutral so they wouldn't be caught up in the shit storm.

You're also wrong to assume that US support was specifically for the Egyptian military.  The State dept cleared exports of tear gas for the Egyptian police, and sent the FBI as advisors to train them.  US support could be said to be not only for the military but for the police state as a whole.

&gt; Like I've said, US sales to Saudi Arabia are modern tanks and jets that are meant for other tanks and jets, and not for crowd control. The real obstacle to the protests are the Saudi police and security forces armed with assault rifles, and not the army that is meant to fight a conventional war against large forces.

You're wrong.  [Modern tanks and helicopters piloted by Saudi Arabia were, in fact, used to quell the protests in Bahrain](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/201131643831976772.html).","1306887018"

"economy","t5_2qhpn","A simple metric for those looking to evaluate whether home prices are too high or too low is to compare them with median incomes. If the median household income in a town cannot justify a conventional mortgage in the same town, prices are generally too high. 

An old rule of thumb was that your house should cost 2.5 x income. More precise guidelines factor in current interest rates (which are very low) against a certain percentage of income as an ongoing housing cost (often something like 35% or 38% of income). So most people can probably afford more than income times 2.5 these days.

The point is, you can use whatever multiplier or assumptions you want, but if homes are not affordable to the people who would want to live there, prices are too high. Some parts of the world are more desirable than others, and some places will have certain inherited-wealth premiums that allow people to buy homes they otherwise could not afford, etc. But there still has to be some sane relationship between the price of housing and local incomes, or the coyote has surely run off the cliff. And by those metrics, current housing prices in most markets are only just starting to reach justifiable levels. 

Compounding the problem is oversupply and a shortage of available wealth/savings to draw upon, meaning that it is likely that homes prices will dip somewhat below historical or ""true"" value-trajectories due to a surplus of available homes and a shortage of down-payment money, not to mention market skepticism and pessimism. 

Nevertheless, overall, home-ownership is still a pretty good financial decision over a 30-year time-horizon, compared to paying rent, since home prices tend to slightly outpace inflation in the long run, as do rents. Over time, people tend to live closer together, so land- and real-estate values tend to increase just slightly higher than overall inflation. In that sense, it's not that a home is a ""good investment"", it's that rent is a bad one, and you are **much** better off paying a fixed mortgage for 30 years and then owning a home free and clear, than you are paying the same in rent, inflation-adjusted, in perpetuity.

Where the comparison gets murkier and tricker is when you compare home-ownership to *cheaper* rent, with the difference re-invested in, say, stocks. 

This is a fairer and more accurate way to evaluate in a purely economic sense, but it is flawed in a practical sense. Most people do not rent the same home they would buy and then reinvest the difference, most people tend to live in or rent the nicest home they can afford. IOW, most renters are not saving the difference, they are instead spending it on a better rental. Moreover, adding ""maintenance"" costs to the homeowner's column but not the renter's column is often deceptive, since the homeowner is commonly improving the value of the home somewhat over time. If the renter wants a nicer bathroom or a deck, they typically have to pay more rent, in perpetuity, while the homeowner can add the improvement with a one-time cost that partially increases the value of the home, in addition to adding whatever ongoing value it offers the homeowner. 

The situation becomes even more complicated when we look at tax implications, which usually tend to benefit the homeowner. Not only is the mortgage interest tax-deductible, but so are equity loans taken against the value of the home. This essentially allows the homeowner to ""spend"" their gains (or re-invest them) in ways that are not usually possible to the renter with similar stock-market gains. 

This kind of stuff makes simple comparisons of buy-vs-rent very apples-to-oranges. The variables are complex but nontrivial. A strict financial comparison ignores taxes and situational variables, but assuming that ""all else is equal"" is not a realistic assumption over a 30-year time-horizon, and some very obvious lifestyle or personal values issues can massively alter the input assumptions.

For example, if you expect to move frequently, then any benefits of hoe-ownership are usually completely negated or reversed in the transactional costs. If you plan to have non-spousal roommates in order to afford a nicer place, renting usually a much better idea, since the biggest variable is no longer financial, but personal (i.e. how well you get along with the roomies over time). Given the high likelihood that one or both of you will become dissatisfied with the living situation, the long-term assumptions in the ownership scenario become almost meaningless. 

As a general rule of thumb, if you plan to stay in one place for a long time with fairly predictable lifestyle requirements, most real-world people will do better owning than renting, by a pretty wide margin. But the margins are much slimmer for hypothetical people, and the margins are also slim in relation to overall housing expenditure. So if there are variables in your life that are significantly bigger than, say, the rate of rental inflation, then it makes a lot of sense to rent. ","1306887021"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Well, yes, but to put it in perspective, a lot of it is the result of him getting massively fucked in the 1920s, after which he became much more business-savvy.

The details: The [woman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Winkler) who distributed the Felix The Cat cartoons agreed to finance and distribute [a cartoon series by Walt Disney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_comedies) because [the guy who owned Felix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Sullivan_\(film_producer\)) was a drunk and a dick. From her experience with the Felix the Cat cartoons, she was careful to retain ownership of anything Disney created that she distributed. 

Disney's people (led by Ub Iwerks) then created a second series of cartoons called [Oswald the Lucky Rabbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_The_Lucky_Rabbit) when she lost control of Felix. She then got married and retired to let [her husband](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Mintz) take control of her business's operations. Her husband then basically forced Disney out by offering him a pay cut and a decrease in budget to stay on while also going behind his back to secure the services of everyone on Disney's staff in the event that Disney should leave. Only two of Disney's employees stayed loyal: his old friend Ub Iwerks and a young animator named [Les Clark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Clark).

Since Disney didn't own the characters, he was SOL. On the train ride back to LA from this fateful meeting in New York, the three men came up with Mickey Mouse. While Ub Iwerks is likely responsible for all of the initial character design, Disney wasn't going to get fucked again and, from then on, he retained as much ownership over anything created under him as he could.

This wasn't unheard of, though, as the other major animation producers of the time did the same thing even though staff animators were probably most responsible for the characters: [Max Fleischer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Fleischer)'s Betty Boop, [Walter Lantz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lantz)'s Woody Woodpecker, and [Leon Schlesinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Schlesinger)'s Looney Tunes. In fact, Leon Schlesinger learned this the hard way since his first cartoon hit was [Bosko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosko), and his [creators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harman_and_Ising) were careful to own the rights to the character, having been two of the animators that were stolen away from Disney and saw what happened.

TL;DR: The whole of late silent/early sound animation is quite a clusterfuck of backstabbing and inbreeding and is well worth reading up on.","1306887036"

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","I posted this in another thread but i thought it could add some discussion to this thread. 

I tried to find out when she may have been kidnapped. . . 1) The first time she gets 'sick' is when they're all in the Oval Office and she sees one of the Silence. There's a weird flashy scene that cuts to the Silence on the plateau from the picnic scene and Amy says, ""I remember."" 

2) Perhaps, then, it's the scene immediately following? She walks into the Bathroom only to encounter a Silence. Her Ganger would have no clue what's going on because of the Silence's memory augmentation. She's told in that exact scene, ""you will tell the Doctor what he must know and what he shouldnt (somehing like that). . . . "". 

3) Another thing to look at with those scenes is that Amy's reaction to the memory wipe is very different then everyone else's. She remembers the one from the plateau. She shouldnt remember. She remembers tidbits from her conversation in the bathroom about telling the Doctor something. All of this leads me to think It may have actually happened sometime before they even get the letter.

A guy on the other thread said maybe looking through the late episodes of S05 might eludicate some hint or clue as to when she was kidnapped.

&gt; Our clue is that in TIA she told the Doctor she was pregnant but in DOTM she told him she wasn't.

I think this is huge and a very good spot on your part; but, she had already seen the midwife 'hallucination' before the end of TIA. I think the hallucinations are the biggest timestamp as to when she was actually taken.","1306887040"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not going to argue whether or not something is addictive right now, because that's stupid. People enjoy things that make them happy, right?

Here's my deal, If people are concerned about availability and frequency based on legality, consider this: 

I am a 19 year old male, I am not involved in drugs at all. However, I know that within 5 minutes I could get pot. If I couldn't get the pot, though, I could probably get pills. If pills don't work out, somebody will be able to supply me with heroin, and it's cheaper anyways. I don't live by the city right now, but I know I'm close enough to find crack pretty damn easily. I don't know about meth, but I can absolutely score amphetamines, and I'm not even near a college town. Cocaine is available within the next two streets from my house. 

I do still have plenty of trouble getting my hands on alcohol, though. Especially on the weekends, it can be damn near impossible. 

So forget all the *awful* consequences that come with smoking pot, and consider how it's legality is not stopping me from getting it, and is certainly not making it any safer.","1306887061"

If you owned a restaurant and were constantly hiring and rehiring employees, how long would you really remember if one of your buddies said ""I had this guy named Joe Smith who left me in a bind""? You'd probably forget it almost immediately unless your buddy had some memorable story about how much Joe Smith sucks. No restaurant owner is going to call every other restaurant owner to ask about every potential hire.

&gt;To whom it may concern,

&gt;I am writing to express my extreme disappointment in AdShel's decision to remove advertising for the Rip &amp; Roll campaign under pressure from the ACL.

&gt;The ACL claims that images of condoms are presexualising children. Condoms are available at all supermarkets, within eye level of children, right next to the paracetamol. Children as young as eleven receive instruction on the purpose and use of condoms as a part of their curriculum. Ads that include enormous billboards promote condoms without any controversy. Clearly, Australia as a society has no issue with allowing children to receive healthy messages about safe sex. It's obvious that the ACL is using this condom excuse to obfuscate their own homophobic agenda.

&gt;I'm confused as to why AdShel would bow to this pressure, when support for same-sex marriage in this country has reached a majority, and tolerance for LGBT individuals is even higher. The ACL and their homophobic attitudes represent a very, very small yet vocal and organised minority. I feel that AdShel is doing a disservice to the community at large by bowing to this pressure. Incidence of STI, including HIV, is rising amongst the whole community, not just gay men. Any promotion of condoms and safe sex is a valuable health message that needs to be seen.

Geography may be one of the factors is creating alliances but it's not the only one nor is it the most important. In Europe, geography was less important in creating alliances than blood lines, for a long time. Germany lost because it broke its alliance. Russians were able to stand because they received help from US and UK after switching sides (USSR was considered an axis power - The Urals were not as helpful as as the American war effort). Fighting a proxy war was safer for the US because the geography was not enough to protect it from an all out war. The 60 year conflict is older than 60 years and it's a war for land not for safety. Japan was always an expansionist power and an economical alliance with the US was in its interest. It welcomed American businessmen and it sent its people to train in American military schools.

&gt;""Live"" refs/linesman.

It seems like could be coming in nhl 12. They say ""Everything is live""

&gt;A ""toe the line"" feature

If they put this in, I would probably disable it. At times I would have supported it, but now I'm fairly good at staying onside. I have a certain rhythm to how I skate, and I wouldn't like it if I was suddenly ""snapped"" to the line. If it wasn't automatic and it forced you to push a button, what's the point? If you're aware you're about to go offside, then just turn back, rather than pressing this extra button. If they could somehow do it without causing me to lose my pace, I would be all for it, for example, a leg stretch that didn't cost me any speed. 

&gt;Reworking of scouting and drafting. Even with maxed out scouting and constant adjusting of scout assignments, it still feels like a bit of a crapshoot. Make the projections as accurate as they are in real life.

They are a crapshoot in real life, and I feel the game is pretty good at the way they do the entry draft as far as possibility of getting a great player. They could certainly jazz it up, but as far as a simulation goes, it's not bad. I bring you to the 1999 NHL entry draft.

4- Pavel Brendl

5- Tim Connolly

8- Taylor Pyatt

10- Branislav Mezei

whether or not you agree with that is up to you.

question for you and everyone else:

the police tried to kick them out. they tried leading them out, they tried handcuffing them. the people you see being hit are resisting arrest. 
i am not justifying, i am simply asking: how should the police then react when someone is physically resisting arrest after being warned to leave for over half an hour?

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","What do you like about SW? What don't you like?

I love Savage Worlds for fast paced play, I was getting fed up with long, drawn out combats (which Savage Worlds can have at times, but I feel as thought it is less often) when I first discovered the system.  It really struck a chord with me.  With minimal modifiers though and such a high player success rate early on, the biggest thing I don't like about Savage Worlds is how difficult it is to get a sense of growth in a long term campaign.  But, that really isn't what the system is about (not campaigns, but the huge character growth level ups).  A lesser complaint, but still one that bugs me from time to time, is the Shaken condition, it sucks to be running a BBEG who stays shaken the entire fight but never gets wounded due to die rolls, or similar to keep a player shaken for an entire combat.  That's not anything major though, and generous application of Bennies can solve that problem.

Have you played before? Would you again? Would you like to?

Yes, yes, and yes.

Any good SW stories to share?

*cough* shameless plug *cough* I ran a game at a convention recently and posted the session on Troll in the Corner, it seemed to be a blast for those involved and I've gotten a lot of positive feedback from listeners as well.  Part [1](http://trollitc.com/2011/05/interface-zero-at-ravencon/), [2](http://trollitc.com/2011/05/interface-zero-at-ravencon2/), [3](http://trollitc.com/2011/05/interface-zero-at-ravencon3/), and [4](http://trollitc.com/2011/05/interface-zero-at-ravencon4/).

Do you play with a Plot Point Campaign? Which one?

I have run 50 Fathoms and Necessary Evil, though neither to completion.  I'm not great at playing Game Master for Super Powered games, just isn't my thing as a GM, though as a player I love them, so I wouldn't do Necessary Evil again, but 50 Fathoms was great and I'm eager to try it again when it comes out after the new Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition later this year.

What house rules do you apply to SW?

I have experimented, though none have been applied permanently, with a few different things.  Spirit instead of Guts, as many settings do, variable Wound levels (anything from 1 to 10 to keep players guessing), and a few weird mechanics I've blogged about on Troll ITC, but weren't spectacular or terribly specific to Savage Worlds.

Do you have any questions about SW?

Not at this time, no.

"travel","t5_2qh41","I don't think you can make a direct comparison between safe doses of radiation exposure from conventional X-rays and these devices.  Because the energy from back-scatter scanners does not penetrate the skin, all the energy is absorbed in the most superficial cell layers.  This concentrating effect, especially after multiple scans, could theoretically increase risk of skin cancers or cataracts, but as far as my Pubmed searches have panned out, there is no good data out there for this sort of device.  Hence, the manufacturers have extrapolated data from other types of radiation, knowing that it sounds good enough for them to get away with it.

Perhaps more significantly, I am not comfortable with the idea of this sort of equipment being maintained by the sort of person who gets employed by the TSA.  For instance, if the scanning beam were to stop moving mid-scan, you could get a focal exposure to a high dose of radiation to a single spot of skin.

Even if the risk were what they say it is, I estimated that you'll get a couple of lethal cases of cancer per year from this device, given the millions of scans that occur annually.  When you compare this risk to zero proven benefit (such scanning has never been shown to reduce the risk of death or injury to passengers), I don't think its use is justifiable.

Thus, although I think the risk is likely minimal, and because I don't have a problem with being frisked, I choose to opt out of these scans.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm pretty indifferent to it all.  I do not use marijuana nor do I necessarily want to surround myself with people that do.  Just my preference.

However, I think people are a little delusional about legalization solving all of the problems.  This is what I think:

1.  Legalizing pot will not end the war on drugs.  There are many other drugs still left.  The only way to end the war on drugs would be to make every drug legal.  I was always under the impression that cocaine/big ticket drugs were targeted more than pot, although still inclusive of pot.

2.  If you don't legalize every drug, there will just be a shift from pot to other drugs amongst the drug dealers.  I don't think it will lower crime rates, really.  I think reddit's view on this is very skewed.  The ones that are being arrested most often are not the white kid from surburbia.  But, this is what we care about most...so, meh.  

3.  *Selling* pot will still be illegal for most people - in order to sell something, you must have proper zoning/licenses.  Plus the taxation would probably be very high. 

4.  Large companies (probably tobacco industry) will take over the manufacture of it.  I'm not really sure of the differences between growing weed and tobacco, but you could grow your own tobacco and people don't.  This takeover of the industry would be quite detrimental to the small-time sellers.  I know that this is probably a bad argument and I admit it has flaws, but I remember reading about a woman who sold weed (and showed up to court with weed in her pocket) in front of her kids.  She did it to supplement her income.  If pot were legal, why would people go to her when they could go to the store and buy it legally?  I believe she would just switch to selling drugs that weren't easy to come by rather than going a legit route, because if she were about going legit, she could grow and sell tobacco/various other items/etc but didn't.  There's no market for small-time sellers of tobacco. 

5.  People seem in denial about the health dangers - they're about equal to alcohol.  Whether one should be legal vs. the other, I'm not going to comment on.

6.  There are health benefits for purified THC.  Not the preferred consumption of most people.  Most people smoke it.  There are many articles that say it's protective and many articles that say it is detrimental.  Until it is known for sure, I would not be in favor of it being smoked (but eating, vaporizing would be largely more acceptable to me).  I cannot think of how ever inhaling smoke would be beneficial - it just seems like an irritant to me.  Some have argued that it causes your defenses to build up.  But, that would be like saying suffering a minor heart attack is a good idea because it helps build cardioprotection for later events.  While true, it's better not to have the heart attack at all.  Also, most chemotherapeutic agents to fight cancer are deadly to healthy cells and you would never use them in a healthy person as protection against cancer.  I'm not sure how THC works in that it could differentiate between cancer cells vs normal cells.  I'm not saying it's not possible, I just don't know enough about it.

7.  There are no proven benefits for it's legalization for recreational use.  And health risks are largely unknown, especially long term.  

But, the more I think about it, it should be decriminalized.  I just don't think any of the reasons why it should be legalized are convincing enough.    ","1306887245"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I hate credit cards and would never use them except for the following:

1) If you don't use a credit card, you can't get the kind of credit you need for a loan on a house.  I'm still on the fence about if I even want to get a loan on a house since, if you really save well, you can usually pay for a house in cash long before you'd ever pay off a house loan.  Nonetheless, you need to build credit.

2) Cash back rewards.  I set my credit card to pay off in full each month automatically.  I always keep at least a 5 grand buffer in my checking account in case of emergencies and that also ensures that my card will always get paid off.  That way, I get 1.5% back on every purchase that I can dump into my Fidelity brokerage account.  Everything else gets dumped into my Roth IRA and the moment I hit the annual maximum on that I dump the rest into mutual funds.

I'm 24.  Mark my words people.  I will get out of the rat race by age 45.  I'm not saying this to brag, but to encourage you.  What you sow now, you will reap later.  If you sow debt now, you will reap debt later.  If you sow investments now, you will reap huge returns later.

No matter how little you can invest, invest it.  You will not regret it later.  ...unless you're dead, but honestly, you won't care then.","1306887251"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","- As we're walking towards the car, one friend tells us that he's going to split - because he's dropped his phone somewhere and he needs to find it (it was his work phone, he didn't really have an option) so we say ok, we'll catch you later.  Me and my last friend get back to my car, everything is sweet - and it turns out our missing friend was UNDER MY CAR.  Instead of running down the bottom of the T, he had dipped into someones back yard and was hiding under someones porch and had heard the cop doing his thing.  Apparently he had been hanging out on the street for 15 minutes yelling YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN A LOT LESS TROUBLE IF YOU GIVE YOURSELVES UP NOW BOYS. 

- We all jump in the car and start rolling away, but my mate tells me to slow down so he can jump out and find his bag that he threw over a fence.  I do, and I get out too and see if I can get my bag (I had thrown it over this massive 12ft fence) but sadly the gate was locked and I couldn't get in.  I realized that the bag had my full name and mobile number on it..so I was a bit worried, but nothing came of it - I guess the people who owned the house had just chucked it out or whatever. 

- I jump back in the car with one of my 2 mates, but the other is walking up and down the street trying to work out where his bag is - I suppose we had been so scared that he didn't remember which house he chucked it into.  We're sitting in my car with the lights on ready to roll, as we see a car coming up behind us.  It was a cop car.  I chuck the lights off and whisper to my friend in the passenger seat ""get down, cop car behind us"".  We get right the fuck down in the front seats, slowly lowering our seats so the cop can't see our heads or anything.  The cop must have seen my friend who was still looking for his bag, parks behind us and gets out.  When I saw parks behind us, I mean with a foot between the back of my car and the front of the cop car.  We figure we're all fucked, but we keep our mouths shut and our heads down.

- The cop gets my friend, sits him down on the curb opposite my car (it's a one way street, so there's only like 15ft between my drivers side and where the cop had my friend sitting down) and starts asking him questions.  We can hear EVERYTHING, and my friend in the passenger side has his bag full of paint with him in the car.  My thought process was something along the lines of ""the cop must know we're in the car, he parked behind us and saw us with our lights on.  He's dealing with *our friend* and then he's going to come get us"".  My mate is trying to calm me down, assuring me that he doesn't know we're in the car.

- A few minutes later, 2 new cop cars pull up and park in this one way street - one in front of my car and one parallel to my car on the other side of the street, where my friend was originally sitting.  We can't see anything now, but we can hear at least 3 cops talking to our friend asking him where his friends (us) were.  He knew full well that we were in the car RIGHT NEXT TO THE COPS WHO WERE ASKING, and he was laughing and shit - but didn't give us up (top dude, right?).  So this goes on for about 40 minutes - the cops get my friends phone and call his parents explaining the situation.  Now ANOTHER cop car rocks up with a backpack full of paint and a blackbook (sketchbook).  From the car we hear them talking about it, and we hear our friend saying ""that isn't mine"".  We later found out that it wasn't actually one of our bags, the cops had just found another backpack in someones front yard full of paint.  At the time I was worried that it was the bag with my name and number on it, but it wasn't so whatever.

- We wait around for the cops to leave, they take our friend - and we drive to our OTHER friend's (the one who went looking for his phone) house.  On the way we pick up our jackets/markers that we had hidden in the trailer earlier.  We told him everything, and he said that our friend who got busted had called him and given him his half of the story - we were all AMAZED that we had gotten away with it.  FYI, the cops had absolutely nothing on the friend that they caught - other than one cop saying ""yeah he looks like one of the ones I saw painting"", so he got away clean.","1306887252"

I spent some time in Wakayama, on our way round the coast to get to Katsuura and see a world heritage site that I forget the name of. Long waterfall. Pretty temple built by it. Shuttle busses to get up there- but on the three hour train ride, we passed countless other mountains stretching off into the distance. I didn't see many roads leading away from them, and these trains were hardly regular, which suggests that in the inaka, there are generally less people living next to and clambering up their local mountain?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No one is saying cannabis isn't psychologically addictive. Hell I'll admit it, I am psychologically addicted to pot. I smoke weed everyday and will always oblige if someone offers me some. It helps me sleep and I love how it improves music, sex, food, etc. 

The other week my dealer went out of town without telling me first, so I was pretty much without a supplier for close to 2 weeks. My first night, I had some trouble sleeping...and that was it. I woke up the next day feeling completely normal and focused. No withdrawals, I wasn't craving pot throughout my work days. 

Yes, pot is psychologically addictive, but so is everything. The repercussions of a pot addiction is no where near that of chemically addictive substances. Quitting cigarettes was one of the worst experiences of my life, a 2 week break from smoking pot after many years of heavy smoking was a mild discomfort. ","1306887257"

"Endo","t5_2s8ot","Thanks for the support! It does feel like people who don't have the illness don't know anything about it. It's almost too exhausting to talk to them since they want to talk fertility drugs and adoption and depending on the severity of the illness (in my case, it's super aggressive) drugs aren't an option and for me personally adoption isn't something I would pursue...but I suppose if I get bit by the baby bug I may later. It is almost an assumption that they know something about my body or my pain that I somehow missed in all my years...

I wonder if it would be easier if I had woken up and had the doctors tell me that they had to take everything out. At least then it would have been final. But since I technically *can* have kids, it feels selfish to in a sense choose my own peace of mind and lack of pain over the possibility of a kid someday...as if I have to choose between my own life pain free and  a kid I don't even know I want to have or even could have (because of course the loss of fertility is already present and I'd be coming to it later). It's like this weird limbo land...I feel like I'm being forced to figure this out now instead of being able to come to it as I feel or don't feel the need...and I suppose in a sense we are. 

I spent all this time knowing that I could have a kid if I wanted, now, knowing the level of pain I was in - debilitating, non-functioning, agony - there is no way I could handle it. I know that intellectually and physically, but it's like I still want my options so I keep looking for the loophole. Isn't it my choice? Isn't it my right as a woman to be able to have a kid whenever I choose? It's such a strange thing to have your own reproductive system limit your reproductive options...And then there's this whole womanhood thing...where I just don't work...one of the major defining characteristics of what it means to be woman and my body is actively destroying it. 

My brain keeps spinning and right now I think I too am a little lost but also moving forward. I suppose in certain situations, that is all we can do. It's nice to know we don't have to move forward alone. :) ","1306887258"

For example, I'm in my final year of a ling degree (well, 6 classes + thesis left). But if I wanted to switch to psych, anthropology, history, or other humanities/social sciences, at my uni I could do it in a year (if I had special permission to take a course and its prereq at the same time).

I don't know if my advice is any good for you, but Park Ranger would be tough, depending on the anthro classes you have (here, Parks Canada generally looks to hire people with degrees in Zoology/Geology/GIS, Ecotourism, or environmental stuff). Trades are awesome and important, but from what I understand there's way more apprentices then there are people to take them.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Meh, maybe. Libraries in their current inception are very different than libraries as the began. In the beginning they were private institutions that were closed and expensive. Members libraries, monasteries, universities all had collections of books but they were expensive and more limited than books as we receive them today.

Andrew Carnegie (of the hall) benefited from accessing the library of a rich man in his area that allowed poor workers to visit his library on Saturdays. This inspired him to create a series of Carnegie libraries that adhered to the same principal, and have acted as the model for contemporary lending libraries. The New York Library system is still largely based on Carnegie Libraries I believe, and his first one in Braddock had an opera house, a swimming pool and a social club. His philanthropic streak (combined with conditions that he asked the receiving towns to adhere to and rules he put in place in the library system) opened up the possibility of reading to a whole new set of people that before would be lucky to get access to a book. 

But he was rich enough to do whatever he wanted and I bet Bill Gates or Google could do the same today no matter what restrictions their running into with their book projects (and while google may have stepped back from their plans, that's not quitting). It's not as if lending libraries grew up in some idealist utopia where copyright was less stringent and fairer, but what we have today in the west is largely thanks to the will of one man that wanted to bring reading to more people, and anyone determined enough could probably do it again (although maybe no in America this time).","1306887263"

When I was about 10 years old, I worked on a pig farm for a local farmer. I was getting paid pretty well, I would imagine, for a kid my age, but this hardly made up for the work conditions. I would work 11 or 12 hour days shoveling pig shit and worse. ""What could be worse than pig shit?"" you ask? Well, one of the farrowing houses that he owned hadn't been used in quite some time, and it had a layer of hog shit about 3 feet deep. You would think that the shit would have dried up after being there for so long, but after you broke through the crust on the top, it was a thick maggot infested mess beneath. I was working my way through this quagmire of terror when I ""struck gold"" and by gold I mean a dead piglet that I managed to cut in half with my shovel. Very few things make me dry heave (including seeing a dead cow explode) but that was one of them. That and a bucket full of liquefied dead pigs","1306887269"

We had a holocaust survivor come to our school to talk about her experience .  When the assembly was starting and all the students were walking through the halls to go over to it, my biology teacher didn't excuse us to go.  She just kept teaching.  

I raised my hand and said ""Aren't we going to the assembly"" because I felt I may never hear someone speak live about the concentration camps.  My teacher, who was German, says ""The Jews didn't have it all that bad during the war.  We Germans had it much worse.  We didn't have electricity at times."" And then made a reference about not being able to use electric hair curlers for her hair.

&gt;yes there is. I believe in evolution.

yes I accept the fact of evolution as well.

however human intelligence has not increased very much if at all in the last 100,000 years.  we are no smarter than the Cro-Magnon man eating grubs off of rotten logs. we are no smarter than the extinct neanderthal (and possibly less intelligent as their brains were larger than ours)

evolution does not favor intelligence after you have become the dominant species on the planet and no longer have natural predators. which happened about 100,000 years ago.

in fact if you take the idiocracy approach, stupidity will far out reproduce intelligence.

so you're theory that europeans are more evolved/intelligent than africans since they came on the scene later, while valid, is not correct.

when choosing a mate 100,000 years go a female is more likely to select the strong healthy fit male who is a good hunter and likely to produce strong fit offspring.  selecting a weakling who can do abstract maths in his head does not help her.

however in some cases I could see intelligence being beneficial, for instance a man may be smart and hence invent a better spear or arrow or some kind of thing that makes his life easier and makes his tribe stronger, in which case he may gain great notoriety among his peers and then have his selection amongst female mates.

I believe this is also a factor.

but as far as modern humans are concerned our cognitive abilities are quite equal across the board.

how we choose to use or not use those abilities and also our environmental factors play a much larger role.

if Einstein were born a peasant in Cambodia instead of in a first world nation like Germany he more than likely would not have become a famous physicist.

Fun anecdote:  When I was a teenager I did one of those ""zoo teens"" volunteer jobs that most zoos have.

This was 50+ years ago, when that sort of shit was totally acceptable.  They were sold to different circuses when they were still sub-adults (kids?).  Decades later, both elephants eventually ended up at the Birmingham zoo.  

When the two girls were introduced to each other, they went *nuts*.  Trumpeting, joyfully wrecking things, caressing each other with their trunks, the whole nine yards.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","First you say 

&gt;Most mainstream Christians believe that coming to Christ is a personal choice and you can't be coerced into it (at least most Christians I've met). Christianity is a relationship with God and you can't be forced or scared into a relationship with someone.

then go on to say 

&gt;You can be too, salvation is available to everyone. There are no ""chosen ones"".

That doesn't sound like a choice to me, more like the illusion of choice. 

&gt;What about Jesus' miracles and the prophecies about him?

You mean the book that was written about him? The one that laid out prophecies in part 1, and then these prophecies were fulfilled in part 2? 

&gt;Another point, Christians are called to give 1/10 of their income to a charity of some kind, but they don't have to. It is their personal choice how much they give, if anything.

I'm curious as to where you came up with the 1/10 number, and why it's a choice? All I know is [Matthew 19:21](http://bible.cc/matthew/19-21.htm) and [Luke 12:33](http://bible.cc/luke/12-33.htm) which tell you to sell all of your possessions.","1306887279"

Anyway, it's not just the ratio of the omegas, but how much you take in, in general. A diet high in omega 6 is simply not healthy. Omega 6s have been proven to contribute to a variety of horrible things that can befall you (heart attacks, thrombotic stroke, arrhythmia, arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammation, mood disorders, obesity, and cancer). 

It's not really the supplement so much as it is the rest of the baggage that comes along, as I said above. Foods high in omega 6 tend to be (high in antibiotics use, disease, low nutritional value) for meat and otherwise horrible for you (processed foods). A low calorie supplement encourages you to go to poor food sources for primary food, which I can't say I agree with. The fish oil may work out fine, but you might be trading off in other areas when you pick up ABC generic beef. 

I mean, I'm not one to preach. Ultimately it's up to you. I would just prefer to stay on the safe side, especially with all the misinformation that goes around surrounding dieting, and back myself up with the research. Research shows I should limit my omega 6 as much as possible. That doesn't mean counteract it with omega 3 pills and hope for the best. I'd rather not chance it. ","1306887289"

I would further argue that Ashcroft and co-conspirators may well have violated [18 USC 242](http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC00242.html) on this and several other occasions (Padilla, etc.) while he was in office, but that is a separate matter that will never be resolved as it is too political.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; it sounds like you think a gravitational wave can displace matter.

&gt; it's a change in the distances between fixed coordinate points

I tried to be very careful to be sure I associated displacement and  velocity with space, not the objects.  I understand this part.

&gt;you might be under the impression that gravitational radiation carries momentum

I guess I was under the impression that I wasn't sure if there was a difference between distorting empty space and distorting space occupied by a massive point-like object.

&gt;I haven't the foggiest idea what you're trying to learn here, so perhaps none of that was helpful at all

It helped.  What I wanted to learn, and did, was the behavior and properties of a point mass occupying space that is both quickly accelerating and moving at near light speeds.  It does nothing it wasn't doing before.  

What got me wondering was that object B appears to be observing object A accelerate/gain relative velocity.  Since I didn't know what would really happen, but one possibility in my mind seemed interesting, I asked the question.  

Here's another related question.  If you could mark a point in space time with a highlighter, that point would appear displaced to a remote observer when a gravitational wave crossed that space (assuming we have really good eyesight).  What would that same remote observer see if instead a massive object was placed near the highlighted point such that it now lies in a curved part of space-time?  If I've truly learned anything, the answer is it would not appear displaced (crosses fingers)

One thing is certain, every major military power has spent some time thinking about how to take down a modern carrier. Some of those resulting plans would most certainly work. What most people don't consider is that the whole battle group doesn't sink when the carrier does, these are still formidable ships. Survivors will be recovered, as will helicopters and hopefully the planes.

It seems that people have this notion that a modern carrier is invincible and that when a single vulnerability is found, they become useless. It's not useless when we have two more show up two days later, and another two three days after that.

if it doesn't have that switch, you might consider opening it up to see if it does (do not open a laptop).  if it doesn't, you probably need to switch out the power supply.  You could go to the trouble of getting a big transformer, but they're expensive and you'll do better in the long run to get the replacement powersupply.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Quick thoughts:

I don't know about the labels, labels (like conservative and liberal) are hard to define with any consensus so I'll go on my best guess. This is not fault of yours but rather that one persons' liberal is another's progressive is another's conservative is another's heresy is another's orthodoxy ad nauseam-- but I think that's a difference between those camps. Whether humans have original sin.

What I think: I believe that, yes, humanity is depraved. Sin affects our entire being and there's nothing we can do to earn God's favor. But he provided the means by which to correct our fallen state and be, so to speak, in his family even though we did not deserve it at all.

And so when you are a Christian you are not what you once were but your are not yet what you are going to be, that is, perfected. Not anything more than human by particularly and fully human. More human than you were before. Getting to be how God intended humanity to be is the goal. And the resurrection promises that final harmony. Humanity must completely reject and repent of their, and here's that word, sinful, nature.

On the other hand, that isn't to say people are worthless. They are made in the image of God. They are not just masters but caretakers of creation (when we screw that one up, that's another part of our depravity). But God still entrusts us to do his work here on earth. God still loves us even when we don't deserve it.

In short, God chooses to mind us out of great love and it is undeserved. But at the same time, God chose to create us in his image, not because he was lacking, but because he chose to out of his own goodness love something and make important what did not have to be. I call it love, others might call it stupidity or foolishness.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","&gt; SRV &amp; Double Trouble first performed at Montreux in '82. The lineup for that night featured primarly acoustic sets, while Vaughan and Double Trouble went on stage highly amplified and several audience members started to boo.
But despite the stunned dejection that SRV felt after persevering through a uncompromising set, this was the turning point in SRV's career, leading to post-show encounters with Jackson Browne and David Bowie, who proved instrumental in bringing Stevie's music to an appreciative global audience.

&gt;When Stevie, Chris, and Tommy returned to Switzerland three years later, with organist Reese Wynans adding rich new dimension to the Double Trouble sound, the Montreux crowd was primed for a rip-snorting set, and SRV's jubilant response is a joyous thing to witness. One of SRV's favorite bluesmen, Johnny Copeland, appears for a three-song triumph in a set that's uniformly superior and ecstatically energized.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I will not name the district, but I was intimately involved in it. It's in the Midwestern USA. This district was very vocal in its claims of being under-funded and as a result, under-performing.

I took the time to find and read the school district's budget for the previous year (they are public information). The average teacher in my district (by my, I mean the one I was involved in looking at) received a base salary around 52,000USD; this is in a city where the average person's income was 34,000USD.

In the personnel expenditures was a table of ""grandfathered contracts""; there was a 4 year negotiation between the teachers and the district that culminated in a new contract. Those teachers with less than five years remaining before retirement were allowed to remain under their old contract (The pay scale was lowered). The average salary for those teachers was around $72,000. In addition to the salaries, teachers received anywhere from 8,000-22,000USD in benefits (pension contributions, health insurance contributions...grandfathered contracts also provided for family members). The grandfathered contracts were not factored into the general district average as they would have bumped it up.

This same district was forced to pay 240,000 USD in severance to a superintendent who failed to perform his duties. This superintendent was also provided with a full pension equal to 60% of his 185,000USD annual salary once he reached the age of 65. The next superintendent was in a similar arrangement, albeit less expensive.

Some of the gems included: 50K for a culinary accessory that was never used due to its installation in a non-sanitary location violating health code, 750K for a landscaping improvement to a facility that needed structural work badly (the landscaping was fine, the structural work would have cost 250K), 200K per year into technology that was never used (They would throw out 500+ 2 year old computers every 12-18 months)...etc.

The budget office would sign any request it was given with few questions asked; the board would hire family over competence...a staff roster was filled with the same surnames.

The annual budget for this district was between 30-40 Million USD; the student population was under 4K. Average per student expenditure was usually 7.5-8K; this same district spends much more now. High school graduation rate was under 60% in that year.

I won't go into more detail as it's easy enough to guess the district if you know some of the details...but many of the ""problems"" voiced by the teachers/administration as being the cause of the poor academic results were complete and utter bullshit. 

The funny thing about schools in the USA is that no one ever bothers to actually read the budgets in depth; they go through the overview and leave it at that. Schools and non-profits have wonderful accounting tricks that allow you to show 97% of money going towards a program when in reality they spent it on food/trips/salaries...

There are plenty of wonderful teachers in districts across the US; they make an impression on the kids they teach. The ones everyone hears are those that play the game of politics well; many good teachers end up getting sick of the politics and leaving to do something else. The bad ones tend to push them out. At least this is my experience.","1306887346"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","The most important thing to remember in this situation is, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. It really isn't. It feels that way, but it's not. 

You can't control the fact that her mother took her own life. That is a crippling blow to ANYONE at ANY point in their life, and you can't say that she **wouldn't** be in the same place depression-wise if you were still married. Divorce is hard, absolutely, but so is being in a relationship you aren't truly happy in. In my life, those have been the times that I have been the most depressed-I just felt like I had no soul anymore. 

YOU DID NOT THROW HER TO THE WOLVES. I know it feels that way, and if you had initiated the divorce the day after her mother took her life, I might agree with you. But you put your happiness first (which is the most important thing to do in anyone's life), and then this event happened. You did your best to support her through that period-you have done the exact opposite of throwing her to the wolves. 

It sounds like she needs to seek professional help (I'm sure others have said the same thing). It's more likely (no offense intended) that it isn't **you** she is missing as much as she is missing stability, familiarity, the comfort that everything is normal and okay. 

Another reason she should seriously considering seeking a psychologist or psychiatrist is-depression runs in families. You didn't allude to the circumstances surrounding her mother's death (and I'm not requesting that you do) but if it *was* due to some form of depression, she may be at risk for similar events. And no one wants that. 

Best of luck to you, and her-but please please PLEASE keep reminding yourself, that it's not your fault that her life fell apart. It's very possible that without the loss of her mother, she would be thriving at this point. And you most certainly were not involved in the loss of her mother. Keep making yourself happy because that is all that you can control. 

Sending love and hope your way. ","1306887348"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I've played it a decent amount and have a good deal of experience in 1v1 pvp. The new patch is excellent but a tad weak in certain areas. It's overall a patch that makes a lot of very slight changes so that the game can be a touch more balanced and there is no dramatic change that I've seen as of yet. Essentially, they've done well in not making retarded over the top changes for once.

However because the changes to a previously lacking and ""meh"" doctrine like the armour company are subtle rather than changing the status quo I feel it's still lacking a little. The M8 rush is still much, much more viable than a sherman rush, even when you're winning with the map advantage. The croc is still at 110 fuel and isn't that much better with the flamer. I had a croc at point blanc get 25 kills in about 2 minutes against a mass of infanty. The ostwind @ 40 fuel is still far better imo with similar armour, anti-light vehicle power and would have killed the lot in 50 seconds tops.

I would say, if the circumstance comes around again, go easier on the strictness, because it doesn't seem to be working for you. You are in an unfortunate situation where your daughter can play both her parents off each other, but there is no use denying the reality of the situation.

&gt; As for meeting people, I have to be shoved, tricked, forced and swindled into it. I just cannot go out and meet people. Damn I'm lonely...

Practice social interactions. Too hard to make connections if your anxiety level is already high. Force yourself into social groups, even if it wears you out. I find I am dead tired the day after, and sweaty the day of. Oh well...

&gt; I do exercise whenever I have a little bit of energy, but this depression has just got me beat.

You will have to do a little bit of motion to release the energy for exercise. In a depressed state, motivation follows action, so force yourself into a small distasteful action to ""prime the pump"".

&gt; I'm smooth with the manners, just painfully shy.

You are focusing on the ""how you say it"" when you should be focusing on the ""what you are saying"". Your job is to find out as much about the other person as possible, to form as complete a picture as you can. It is not a trick, it is a mindset. People like themselves, and they like people who take an interest, pay attention to what they say, repeat back what they understand, notice exactly the things that are most remarkable about the person. Get their name, find out what their name means, find out why they got the name, repeat the name, form the association in your mind so you can later recall the name.

&gt; My birthday was just a small example. It really hurt when my entire family chose to ignore my birthday yet they never fail to celebrate for everyone else.

Yeah, it hurts. You may have no alternative but to be radically forgiving to them, because you need as much human interaction as you can get. Nobody likes to be stepped on and marginalized, but nobody likes to be completely isolated either. I recommend you practice radical forgiveness to the people closest to you, because ultimately it would be the most loving and cherishing thing to do to yourself.

Your rig runs at a higher resolution than 1080p? Please, do tell us about your computer from the future!  

Also, if you are buying your games legally, they are typically not cheaper. I just bought GTA IV for PS3 for $12, that same game costs $20 on Steam right now... if you want to buy it used, you'll end up getting it in a week from eBay and still paying close to retail from shipping.

You didn't share any specs, and judging by your complete ignorance of even the most basic technogical terminology (higher resolution than 1080p... I lol'd), your PC is probably a stock $300 Dell from Staples.

hmm. I have not had that experience. Personally I am not in the market for the expensive bikes. I know about the store due to the weekly 30mi group rides. But the owner is a great guy and mechanically skilled. Previously worked with plane engines and mechanics @ Lunken.

For my parts I typically go second hand or online because that's more of my style. But Brett has been excellent on his labor. My 34 year old road bike had a bent deraileur (my own fault) and I've struggled with it for weeks. He fixed it right up and it runs smooth as silk.

The thing we have to remember is that the modern bike market is splitting into sub-markets. He doesn't compete with someone like campus cycles in anything other than labor costs for repairs. A typical client of a high-end bike store like Element Cycles is a competitive cyclist who bikes for a big university and is interested in that top 3% of performance bikes. Know what I mean?

When I go out with the group ride, I'm the only guy without clipless pedals. When I went on the OTR Bike+Brew, no one had clipless pedals in the group of 30. That was my first realization of how diverse the bike culture is.

It is usually not a good idea to argue with a cop when you have tons of equipment on you because they will find a reason to take you to jail, even if you're notconvicted it's still a pain in the ass..... The cop that confronted me was, like others, very ignorant of the law and used his badge as intimidation, like I'm sure he does with everyone he meets.... There is really no loopholes with photography, there is actually a clear black and white, the problem is most cops simply dont know the law and like to fuck with people out of place...... My advice: always be polite, clearly state that you're a photographer and ask if youre violating any law, always ask for name and badge number (they are required to give it up), if possible discretely video recordthe incident (the supreme court ruled that public servants do not have the right to privacy while on duty),make sure your letter to IA is well worded......

My dad warned me not to go too close, because the long grass at the edge would be hiding where the edge actually was (ie, I wouldn't be able to see where I was walking). Being a silly child, I didn't listen, walked over, fell into the canal between the concrete edge and the boat.

Luckily, however, my dad wasn't an idiot. He guessed I'd do that, and was ready to grab my arm and pull me back.

If you live outside of these major areas where the hebes are all around, yeah I can see that it might get a little tribal because we often feel out of place.  Some people are brought up to believe (and not totally without reason) that most people are at least a little bit antisemitic until proven otherwise.

Agnostic is either understood to be 'we don't know' or 'we can't know'; I usually take it as the first. 

Personally, and I mean no offense, I scoff at the idea of a god. As I said before, if we ever meet him, it, them, her, whatever, it can't be a god. It has to be a creature of some sorts, obeying natural laws like any other; it exists within the physical realm, doesn't it? 

Of course you could say there are 'other realms', but even if we find such an otherworldly claim to be true, then it has to contain things that we still can't define as a god? They'll obey other laws... every situation, every particle, every being has to be constrained by a set of natural physical laws. To say otherwise is one of the typical ""extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence"" situations.

I mean, suppose I claim an invisible pink unicorn is in every nook and cranny of our planet. Who's to say I'm wrong or right? There is no proof either for or against, and that's why the burden of proof remains to those who claim the existence of those gods.

You have to get the timing right for both, as a tool you want to make it so he sees the rocket and moves where you want him, but as a weapon firing at the start of the turn makes the rockets a lot more effective.

I've won a number of games because I've had my rockets/grenades lined up to be ready at the start of turns or because my opponent hasn't and I've been able to dodge what could have been deadly blows. 

I've even found that in executing strategies where I may become visible to a unit but I'm ""sneaking"" around to execute another unit that timing is important, if my unit is visible and I do not eliminate my target before the turn ends he can respond, but if in one turn I become visible and kill the target he cannot respond!

Normally I'm on his side against the rest of gunnit in this debate, saying cops should be more restrained. But I would say someone pointing a firearm at you is pretty much always a justification for shooting them.

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","&gt;It appears that you have missed the point. A person can memorize the material to succeed on an exam and end up with very little understanding of what they memorized.

No, I get the point, but went *one point further*: having a store of facts is *necessary* to master material and have a deep understanding. Merely learning facts is not understanding, but one cannot have understanding without knowing the facts. Statements like the OP made is a disservice to those who get more inclined to avoid learning facts, in the same way poor students at math love Einstein's quote about his difficulties in math. 

Most students that get good go through this sequence: memorize facts on a subject, ponder those facts and how they interrelate, and over time get a good understanding of those facts. The OP and related comments seem to imply that memorizing is something to be looked down upon, and it is not. It is necessary to understanding.

For example, no one understands calculus immediately, but learns how to move symbols, some weird terminology, and some basic facts. Only by playing with these facts, doing tons of problems, memorizing more and more ways to move the symbols, moving the symbols enough, and toying with them does one gain enough understanding to where calculus becomes a powerful tool. Memorization comes first, then understanding, in almost every area of learning.

Most people in all countries do not care to master understanding when all they want and need is to pass a class. But don't downplay having a large store of memorized facts to test new information against.","1306887408"

People are not born with a fully formed understanding of race relations. The only way we learn is by spending time and asking questions and staying open minded.

1. Help reduce discrimination of atheists by presenting us as, well, human; as opposed to the immoral heathens that many fundamentalists see us as. Or by helping other atheists deal with discrimination in their lives.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to train exotic animals.  Myself and a coworker were driving to pick up a very rare striped hyena to bring to the park.  We using a method where we put a crate at one end of the enclosure, and use fencing to slowly close the amount of space in the enclosure until the hyena had nowhere to go but into the transport crate.  We each grabbed a panel of chain link fencing and started moving in, and he began to run back and forth as fast as he could along the far side of the fence. 
 As we moved in, he began panicking, and would try to get by the fencing held by another guy we were working with.  He decided to close off the route, and the next time the hyena came running, he went head first into the fence.  He barreled over, and didn't move.  We thought he knocked himself out and we weren't sure what to do.  You don't want to get up close to a hyena and have him wake up all pissed off.  After a while, we noticed he was having trouble breathing.  We figured that he had somehow broken his neck, which was really strange because they have extremely strong necks. Once we determined he couldn't move, we picked him up and put him in the transport.
We spent the rest of the day trying to find a vet that would see him.  No one wanted anything do with him, and it really pissed us off.  He was basically dying in the bed of the pick-up truck.  
We eventually found a vet on the other side of the state. After an exam, we found out he did have a broken neck, and we had to put him down.  It turns out that his original owner fed him only dog food until he was one, and that his bones had not strengthened properly as a result of the diet, causing him to break his neck on a hit that should've done him absolutely no harm.  That whole day was a mindfuck that I will never forget.

Imagine zooming into a fractal on your computer - how does a finite machine hold an infinite amount of information?  

The ying &amp; yang, positive &amp; negative, love &amp; hate, personal battles &amp; triumphs, all echo the nature of reality and it's fractal repetitive nature.  Fractals are feedback loops - point a video camera at a TV that it's hooked up to and you will see it first hand.  Life is a feedback loop, where the output of two humans is the input of another.  The same holds true with our universe, it's all just energy, and we are all part of it. ","1306887429"

Do you think the government felt that way about the postal service, back in the 1790s?

I would point out, to provide context, that fully 20% of the population still supported King George III. By comparison, I doubt there are 1,000 Americans who support al-Qaeda.

So, when the stakes were higher, the government was more circumspect?

They'll keep the same relative orientation to each other in all 3 dimensions.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Pop-ups are *generally* annoying, but they become worse when you have many apps making use of the push notification system. As an example, if I'm playing a game, I may want to know that something is trying to get my attention, but I don't want it to pull my attention away without my having to do something to allow that (other than allowing push messages for apps). Gaming is just one example of why pop ups became quickly dated and are no longer appropriate.

Another example of bad design is the fact that multiple messages received while the device is locked can easily be lost because the user is forced to either read them, one-by-one, and do *nothing*, or launch the app that is sending a push notification and *lose* all the other notifications waiting in line. That's not elegant at all. I should be able, at the very least, to see a list of push notifications that I have received and do something with each one, out of order, if I wish, at my own convenience, not when it's convenient for my phone. I'm the user and the device exists to serve me. That demands a more elegant solution four years into the platform's life.

To put it more simply, the iOS push notification system is designed around the needs of the applications. They need to tell me something and they will take priority over whatever I'm doing. It should be designed around the user (me) and not interrupt when another task is being performed.

A simple, more elegant solution is required. Google seems to have built a notification system around the end user and I see no reason why Apple shouldn't copy the general idea and use it in iOS. The notifications on Android devices are out of the way, but the user is still told about them. The focus is not stolen by a notification and the user can browse the messages when it is convenient.","1306887454"

"intj","t5_2qowo","It's difficult to diagnose the situation without having more information, but if this problem is more about building a relationship with a potential lover then I'd suggest that you focus on doing activities together that you both enjoy. Work on being positive during those activities and show her that you can be both serious but still have a good sense of humor. 

One flirting technique that I've learned is to give ambiguous compliments. Compliments that could be construed as referring her actions or her looks. If she's up for it she will reciprocate in some similar fashion and then you know the game is on. ;)

It's entirely possible that you are doing nothing wrong and that you simply haven't found the right girl/girls yet. With that in mind you should meet and practice your technique on as many women as possible.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's just a color that stains your lips.  There are a ton of different kinds, and some of them last longer than others.  The short-lived ones are like a pen you color your lips with, it's usually pretty tasty stuff even, but it only lasts a couple hours and not through a meal (but it doesn't get all smear-y or leave marks on other things like cheeks).  It's like synthetic berry juice.
The higher-end stains may wear longer, but I'm a freshly graduated college kid so $5-8 for a lipstick is pretty much all that fits into my budget. But I'd suggest looking at Sephora or Ulta, that's where I go to splurge on make-up.

If I'm looking to wear red all day, or for a brighter unnatural red, I go with maybelline superstay type lipstick: http://www.maybelline.com/products/51/lips/lip-color/superstay-24-color/all-day-cherry/015?shadeId=277  The idea is that you clean your lips off, put one side on which is more traditional lipstick textured, but you let it dry and then it won't come off come hell or high water without some kind of make-up remover or the skin on your lips start to peel. You can seriously eat apples without fucking up your  lipstick with this stuff. There is a chapstick type side on the other end to keep it shiny and to keep your lips hydrated. 

Hope that helps :) ","1306887462"

Since then I've re-read the series entire at least three times, and have re-read all the preceding books prior to the release of the next.  

Each time I've re-read the books, I've discovered new and different details, plus I think one of the more interesting things for me is in the intervening almost-15 years, it seems like my own interpretation of some stuff has changed.  I find that being over 40 instead of in my mid-20s is also a huge difference and has vastly changed my overall perception of certain characters; some that seemed all noble and cool to my younger self now just make me roll my eyes.

And people are so fucking petty when it comes to what their food looks like - if your carrot isn't uniform it must be inedible. SO much food is wasted because of the way our food industry operates. 

The cow in the paddock is the most amazing near-closed sustainable food system we could have for meat. We don't need to factory farm it - it is completely ineffecient (of course, this depends on whether you measure efficiency in terms of your wallet). If everyone ate meat only one or two days a week like we are meant to instead of for every single meal, or chose to eat only free-roaming meat, or ideally, only eat meat they hunted and killed themselves, the world would be better for it - economically, culturally, socially, and in terms of health.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I tend to flip flop on this issue often. 

Living in San Francisco, you tend to see many types of smokers. Old, young, homeless, professionals, students, hippies stuck in 1970, tourists, adults mentally and emotionally crippled with high school levels of maturity, you see all types. 

I tend to think that if alcohol is legal and regulated, so should marijuana. Just like alcohol effects people in different ways, so does marijuana. Blatant legalization, without restrictions and regulations I am not in favor of and fear for its repercussions on our society. I would expect a result similar to the society crippling opium problems in Asia's past if it were that freely available and accepted.  

One problem with marijuana is regulating potency and determining a level for which the typical person is over the edge. You can't quickly just take a breathalyser or urine test and determine if you are over a legal safety limit. You can quickly tell if someone is high, but not necessarily how high and how functional.

There is no consensus on its benefits or problems, there are as many studies about its negative affects on people as there are that refute them or propose positive effects. I don't disagree that there are beneficial benefits, but I also do not deny that it has noticeable negative effects. 

Most of the studies I have read over the years involve test methodologies that rarely follow any large sample for 20 years or more. They are usually short term and focused on a specific issue, not the larger landscape and other effects that come with it. With such small research samples and focused research, you really have no confidence in many of the results good or bad. Studies that purport positive benefits neglect to focus in detail on the negative effects observed during the studies, and vice versa. For example, You don't read about how many people's glaucoma problems improved in a study about the psychotic effects of smoking. No study really focuses on or attempts to really understand what a person may have lost in life until a decade or two passes and they realize they smoked away that much of their lives instead of actually living it.

Sure its been around for most of history, and the non smokable uses are mighty epic with regards to clothing and textiles and other uses beyond getting high. 

The amotivational and psychological problems over time can be very crippling on a person's potential, but hey, its their choice to mess up their lives with something that they feel alleviates the problems right?

Well, its my choice and vote to not have my tax dollars subsidizing your laziness, health problems, and self induced limitations because you want to get high. 

At my age we all have friends who have smoked regularly for 20 years or far more, some are very successful, functional, and casual about it; and just as many have turned into the dude from The Big Lewbowski, barely able to function in society, and no interest in the things that used to drive them and make them interesting people. They got stuck in time 20 years ago and have not really grown as a person since then. For others, it was a gateway to other things that eventually killed them. I agree with all the stories, I probably have a friend who fits every single good or bad story about pot use to the letter. 

Arguments about sober folks causing the same problems or having similar psychological issues is pointless and off topic, and akin to saying ""look at the shiny object over here and lets take a tangent, or lets compare this apple to this orange."" 

This is a drug that will cause these issues in people who would never have had them in the first place had they not been regular smokers.   

Today's pot is significantly stronger than the pot of the 60's and earlier generations and era's. The short term memory problems and time distortion effects are crippling for a lot of jobs and, like a drunk, have potentially fatal consequences for having a clouded absentminded head space. The effects can also have impacts on your brain and body functions many days after using it.

If it could be regulated in quality and potency, and limits could be set and measured for legal intoxication limits, it would be a lot easier to win support to legalize it.

&gt;If Islam is to take credit for ""The Golden Age"" (if indeed there existed such a thing), does it also take fault for the current state of the Muslim world? Or is it a case of Islam takes credit when things were good but external factors are to blame when things go wrong?&lt;

In this case, 'hate the player, not the game'.

&gt;Depends who you're asking, do you think the Pagan Arabs thought Muhammad bought only good? Their entire culture was wiped out. As were the Jewish tribes of Mecca and Medina. I'm not sure you're ready for the worst of Muhammad's crimes. Most people accuse me of lying or making things up...&lt;

It doesn't matter what they thought. They used to worship many gods, bury their newborn girls alive, start wars and kill for stupid reasons. Islam came to bring a law which satisfies the rights of God and society.

&gt;I am glad it is not practiced the way it was practiced. There are penalties in Islam for things we would not consider crimes today.&lt;

Islamic law is a very big field, I see you've looked into the 'punishment' section of the law which is in fact the last to be implemented if an Islamic state were present. Islam claims that the laws are absolute and divine, of course as time progresses society will shift in its views and morals. I don't know what else to tell you other than it is what it is. I'm not knowledgeable enough to talk on this specific issue.

All the other statements I've answered in the other comments and threads, and I'm not one to repeat myself so Ill skip to the end.

Sorry Brother, Islam does ""agree"" with science. Maybe in the future we'll have the tools to prove and disprove current scientific fact/theories that give the possibility of what Islam claims. Science isn't scientism.

In the end, as a Muslim, I say what Abu Bakr (RA) once said. If the Prophet said it, then it's true.

If Islam says it, then I will believe it. It is the primary source of truth I have, science will agree, if it doesn't then humans did something wrong.

It encourages what some cultural scientists call the ""drive by"", where someone does something intentionally negative/harmful to someone else, but no actual information about what's going on is shared.  So no one is allowed to learn anything other than ""someone was feeling negative for some reason"" and it's not even helpful to the individual causing the harm, as it doesn't help solve their problem (whatever it happened to be that caused them to feel defensive/offensive).  (Sorry, I can't find the original online community effectiveness research that talked about this.  It was really well done, and maybe I'll have some time later to track it down.)

In the book Honest Signals, MIT professor Sandy Pentland talks about the effectiveness (in problem solving) of a social group being primarily about the emotional state (as evidenced by tone, pattern, and speed and of the voice, mostly) of each individual.  We can tell who to trust and listen to based on their emotional state.  Obviously text-only discussions miss a whole lot of that necessary evidence, but at least we can get a little bit of the information we need to decide who has the more valuable information based on the ""tone"" of writing they offer.  But when the only communication you get from someone is a ""negative"", it messes everyone in the group up.  Of course, the upvote has a similar problem, since it doesn't convey any information about the voter other than they are feeling ""positive"" about *something*.  Ideally, Pentland suggests, each *unique bit of information* being offered by one or more individuals would be presented at the same level of value (votes).  This eliminates the wasted ""Me too!"" votes, and allows everyone to have an opportunity to have as much information as possible (in order to make the best decision).","1306887505"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think you'll find that most women would be pretty creeped out by this. 

I'm not very articulate but I'll try to explain part of the reason this might be. 

Women grow up knowing that (not that I think we necessarily *should* be taught some of these things, just that we are) we need to protect ourselves from sexual assault / predators / rapists etc. Men are normally stronger than we are, the majority of adult rape is carried out by men and they are often in positions of power over us. We grow up knowing that if we dress too slutty, or are thought of as ""easy"" that we may even bring this type of assault down on ourselves. 
Women feel threat in men's sexual advances in a way that I don't believe men can really understand without some serious thought. 
Not in all advances, of course! Just saying that we are much more aware of the possibility of having something like that happen then man can ever be. 

So I think someone coming up to us like that, even if we find them attractive, is creepy and somewhat scary.","1306887525"

My personal experience is buying server space that allows you to use FTP to upload stuff. Download [Joomla](http://joomla.org), which is free and open source and follow the instructions to install it on to your web server, which I think just amounts to dropping files in the main directory. Also register a domain through any company that does that sort of thing, like [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com), and link it to your server through the GoDaddy account screen online. Once Joomla is installed you can install templates via downloading and FTPing them into your server and edit them to your liking there. If you learn a bit of CSS and html you'll be able to get quite a lot out of almost any template. Learning to do all of this yourself gives you ultimate control and freedom, and is really quite easy.

What I seriously recommend, in response to a question like ""How can you love your children if..."" is to question why she thinks that way.  There are multiple reasons it's important to do this:

* If you can't answer the question yourself of why she thinks that, it means you don't understand how she thinks on a pretty important subject, and you should try to understand her better.

* She may not be able to articulate immediately why she thinks that, and the exercise of trying to articulate it may help her recognize that it doesn't make sense.

* People love to be listened to, and that's particularly true of many wives.  If it's clear that you're honestly trying to understand what she believes and want to hear what she has to say, that alone can go a *long* way towards making her feel better, because she'll feel that you're valuing her perspective, etc.

One important question in all this: are you sure this episode wasn't associated with PMS?  I've known quite a few perfectly rational women who could turn into nothing short of raving lunatics when suffering from PMS.  In that case, in my experience, it can be a good idea to try to raise the subject when she's on a more even keel, and find out which of the things she said are things that she feels are issues even when she's not having a tantrum.

I'm not trying to be mean about her looks, btw; I'm no prize myself by this girls face looked like the fucking moon. Also, turns out she's not very interesting either.

Anyway, after chatting for a bit the greasiest looking dude I've ever seen slithers in and makes a three-some out of our two-some. This guy was trouble. If AIDS wore skin and hair gel it would look like this guy. From the conversation, it was clear the two had been talking earlier in the night. Nonetheless, I'm assuming whatever evolutionary path has led this girl this far will at least leave her with the wherewithall to avoid someone who is clearly a disease carrier. Just as I'm thinking that, she politely makes her excuses and heads out of the club with Hepatitis Harry. I shrug; mission accomplished I guess. My mate heads home with his love interest, and it's only once I've smoked an entire pack of cigarettes and am crying outside in the rain that I realize how truly depressing it is to be palmed off by the ugliest girl I've ever seen, in favour of the ugliest guy I've ever seen.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;It's just the illusion of choice if it is already known what decision you are going to make.

Why is that so? I don't agree with that. ""Unpredictability"" is not inherent to the definition of ""choice.""

Here's a story.

&gt;Let's say we decide to build a house. We start construction, months go by, and finally I'm sitting on top of the house, pounding in nails. Right as finish pounding the last nail in, completing the house, a person walks by and says, ""Hey, you believe in God, right?""

&gt;""Yeah,"" I say.

&gt;He says, ""And you just finished building a house, right?""

&gt;""That's right,"" I say.

&gt;""So do you believe that, from the foundation of the world, God knew that you would build this house,"" he says.

&gt;""Yep,"" I say.

&gt;""Well,"" he says, ""that means you didn't build a house. You just had the illusion of building a house.""

That's an absurd thing for the passerby to say, isn't it? Clearly I built the house. Building a house is a process. It involves laying a foundation, raising the structure, connecting it all together, installing wiring, appliances, putting a roof on top, etc.

I did all of those things. So, I built a house.

Similarly, making a choice is a process. It involves sets of stimuli, some internal, creating a neural chain reaction that yields an emergent conscious evaluation of a menu of imaginary options, weighing pros, cons, risks, rewards, or just saying ""whatever, I'll go with my gut,"" finally resolving in the form of a choice.

I do all of those things. Thus, I make choices.

The difference between decisionmaking and house-building is that decisionmaking processes are so often obfuscated within a mysterious neural medium of which we have little understanding. Furthermore, the particular choices that other people make are very often surprising and unpredictable, which is directly related to the fact that these processes are ill-understood and hidden.

This high correlation between ""other people's choices"" and ""unpredictability"" makes it seem like ""unpredictable"" is part of the definition of ""choice.""

But it's not.

A choice is just a deliberate action taken from an imagined menu of imaginary potential options. Making a choice is a process, just as building a house is a process. I make real choices even though God determines them from the beginning of the world, just as I build real houses even though God determines them from the beginning of the world.","1306887567"

When I teach those things, I point out that poetry is art, and art is what makes us human. No other species creates beauty for the sake of beauty, as far as I've encountered. 

There is also a critical thinking aspect. What better place to find and think about figurative language? Our lives are steeped in metaphor, and most people don't even realize it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was raised in a Jewish household, but have ""left"" the faith... hope I can help a bit here..

I've found this may largely depend on the parents / grandparents. If there are direct relatives who survived WW2, they have a very huge sense of community and want to preserve it as much as possible. In my case, my grandfather was dating a non-jewish girl before the war, they may have even married. Her parents made her leave him etc etc. Cut to 50 years later, they were NOT happy about me marrying a non-jew.

My father would come home and go on and on endlessly about how he met someone and thought they were Jewish (I think he's a tribesman, he'd say). If they find some things ""from Israel"" better, it's likely because that's what they grew up with. Some food my wife grew up with and raves about is ""meh"" to me. I'm sure there's some food or something similar that you enjoy but others think is meh.

In this poor fellow, the force that caused the concussion is pretty much the same force that can cause a subdural hematoma in the brain, essentially this is a tearing of very small veins that contain a lot of blood. So if this guy has a bleed going on in his brain along with a decreased ability to create a clot due to the alcohol, that means the damaged vessels in his brain will likely not stop bleeding causing a buildup of blood within a limited space, being his skull, will then press on his brain causing a herniation of the brain into the spinal canal and eventually causing respiratory distress (to stop breathing). That's why you don't get into fights while drunk.

&gt;
&gt;* Eventually the lines become distorted that it is far more efficiently to become a ""hermit,"" barter, avoid dollars and any taxable activities, and do basically everything yourself (hoping the tax-goons don't decide to hunt you down for income you never received).
&gt;
&gt;I think we're quickly approaching the last bullet-point. I never thought I'd sound like ""those crazy conspiracy theorist types"" ... but it is not different from calling someone a slut to prevent them from exploring their sexuality.

**I think for many individuals (especially those with zero debt, some investing ""savvy"" and a base of capital to ""play"" with) we have already LONG surpassed that point.**

If you can minimize your expenses, then ""working""; in terms of wages, salaries, and/or self-employment profits -- all of which will be subject to a 15.3% payroll tax {from dollar #1 on up} **PLUS** -- for amounts over ""poverty line"" numbers {minimal tax ""credits"" for living that do not approach even a BARE minimum of the costs of living AND maintaining a ""working"" job -- i.e. transport, clothing, etc. most of which therefore must be paid for with AFTER tax net income} -- being subject to 20% and higher INCOME taxes; AND then on top of that being charged +5% sales taxes and a bevvy of excise taxes and licenses, permits, and other fees.

By comparison, any long term capital gains (with ""long term"" being the ridiculous arbitrary minimum of 1 year) are TOTALLY UN-taxed in terms of ""payroll"" taxes, and only taxed *minimally* as INCOME on the amounts ABOVE the &gt; $33K (single) or $67K (married).

And quite frankly, one would be a FOOL to work a salary job for $40K or $60K or even $100K a year if one can has no debt, can minimize their expenses and manage to make around $20K or $25K in annual capital gains. (Because not only will the wage/salary/profits be taxed at near or above 40%~50%, but your capital gains will be taxed at 25% or higher as well.)

So a single man (let's say mid 40's or 50's) who earns say $50K a year in salary and can (investing wisely) garner $20K in long-term capital gains -- for a total gross income of $70K -- will essentially PAY some $8K in payroll taxes (for the ""privilege"" of working); and *another* $8K in income taxes (roughly Fed + State); AND he will then be subject to another $3K (15%) in tax on his long term cap gains (or worse $5K -- 25% on short term gains).  And in addition, he's probably blowing somewhere between $10K to $15K annually due to commuting to/from a job that is just 1/2 hour away.

So the lion's share of the $50K in ""wage"" income -- some ~$33K (or about 67% of the $50k)  -- will end up going to taxes or expenses DUE TO HAVING THE JOB.  In effect, if he is working 12 months, he only gains anything from the LAST 4 months of labor... the first 8 months going to pay for his commute and the taxes ON the wages.

Conversely, if this same individual were to simply sit at home (minimizing travel to minimize expenses) -- and be happy with his or her $20K of long term cap gain ""investment"" income -- not too difficult if they have $0 debts -- and they will essentially pay NO taxes at all (and no commute charges) -- or if his cap gains are ""short term"" -- well, even still, rather than being taxed at the TOP rates, he will be able to avoid the payroll taxes, offset his earnings with the standard deductions, and end up paying the LOWEST tax rate (10%) on the half of his cap gain income that IS subject to taxes (so maybe $1K a year).

PLUS, of course, that individual would have the equivalent of a FULL TIME JOB'S worth of hours 2,000+ hours of time (actually MORE if count ""commuting"" time) to use as he wishes...  basically that person would essentially be ""FREE"", with LOTS of time to do whatever hobbies, inventions, writing, or other interests suit their fancy, or to do whatever is needed for work on the home or property (and **it no longer matters** if a DIY project takes 2 hours or even 4 hours to complete, when a professional could do it in 1 hour or less... because the ""FREE"" person has PLENTY of time available; they are NOT tired/exhausted/frustrated by a job, and do NOT have to try to cram DIY work into evenings and weekends, etc.)

And if one comes up with business and/or product ideas, one can ""putter"" around with them at one's leisure... for the pure pleasure of the intellectual exercise... and not worry much about whether they are actually put into the market (at least not yet) -- one has the ability to delay THAT form of gratification either until a better economy or business-environment comes back around, or potentially just to let it go forever...  Because seriously?  What more will be gained by lots of ridiculous heavy-lifting labor?  Why work your ass off for 2,000+ hours for such little gain?

Not really ""idle RICH"" -- but ""idle content and financially secure"".  So long as you don't hanker after things designed to impress (mega yachts and European vacations)... one can easily live the life of a ""hermit"" (or as I prefer... a ""country gentleman"").

Great advice.

A few possible explanations:

1. She has buyer's remorse. She feels like a slut for making out with you so soon after breaking up with her bf.

2. Imagine attraction more like a volume knob then a light switch. It doesn't just go off/on, but from mute to extra loud and everything in between. Where the knob is turned to (how attracted she is to you) can vary day by day, and has just as much to do with how she's feeling / what's going on in her life as anything you're doing. Right now she's not as attracted to you as she was previously. How a woman feels about you is closely linked to their current emotional state, which can vary massively from day to day. It's not like with a man, where for him a hot woman is just as hot tomorrow as she is today.

What this sort of argument does is assume that the different genders are homogeneous groups. Now, I'm not saying that there aren't differences between males and females as a whole. Statistics are great and often useful, but they can and should only serve to inform us about tendencies within a group, not to define individuals. The problem is that we don't deal well with probabilistic reasoning. We tend to assume universal quantifiers and assign binary truth values to arbitrary entities in situations where the approach is simply not applicable.","1306887610"

Right now, w informally ~4.8 sigma, this won't likely be a statistical fluke. 5 sigma is generally considered discovery. But there could be a systematic error somewhere (though they recently excluded some possible causes for such error, including the top voted explanation on the link I gave, I think) since what you have is essentially a smallish bump on a graph of many events; if this background of events is not somehow accounted for properly... 

So what is needed is independent confirmation. There's another detector in Tevatron, called D0, that should have seen this too, and then there's the LHC and its two detectors.

FTFY.

It's true that some tribes have benefited, but the vast majority have not.
I'd suggest reading this:  http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ngisc/research/nagaming.html

In many of the cases, casino companies saw a loophole in a gaming law and most of the contracts are between the company and the state where the reservation is, *not* between the tribe and the casino, since Native Americans do not own the reservation land.  Since the casino companies are the ones fronting the money for the venture, they retain the majority of profits (over 50%).  The Indian Gaming Commission also regulates how the tribes can spend the money.  So, yes, it has helped in some small ways, but tribes do not see the majority of that money and it's just another way that corporations and the government have found to screw over Native American tribes.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Actually, there are several details that make this a more muddied discussion. Before people go freely eating non-Zabiha, we need to understand that while a majority of the ulema agree that the meat of the People of the Book is permissible, the vast majority make that statement with reservations that the *method* of the slaughter is critical. 

It is the state of a great many slaughterhouses in the west (I cannot speak for Canada but this is true for the States) due not slaughter in the manner that is appropriate according to the Sunnah. And I am not taking about saying ""Bismillah,"" but other factors of the slaughter. In many cases, when animals are stunned, they are dead before the knife even reaches their throats. In this situation the animal must now be considered carrion and is no longer permissible. In several other instances, the animals are decapitated or the blood is not drained. 

And of course then you get into a more deep discussion, who are the People of the Book? Trinitarian Christians, in general, are not considered a part of this group. Furthermore, at slaughterhouses with no religious affiliation the slaughterers can be atheist, polytheist, etc. And clearly meat slaughtered by their hands is not permissible. And it is even more challenging that in many factory slaughterhouses no human hand is involved in the slaughter of the animal.

[This article expounds on the above link, with proofs from both the Quran and the Sunnah](http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7&amp;ID=2035). In particular, there is the important verse (Al An`am 6:121):

**And do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience.**

If we take this in combination with the verse from Surah Ma'idah quoted above, we see that the food of the People of the Book is permissible, ONLY when the name of Allah is mentioned. This is the case of kosher slaughter and Christians during the time of the Prophet [](/pbuh).

It sounds like zabiha meat is available to you, and I agree that it is not as convenient as going to a local grocery store or ordering a steak at any restaurant. But consider the consequences. There is a hadith that knowingly consuming that which is impermissible can invalidate your prayers for 40 days. Is it really that much more of a burden to be careful? When you eat out, is seafood not available?

Do try to get some feedback on the paper so that you don't press any crank buttons -- maybe here if you're OK with sharing it?

In terms of the destination, that shouldn't be hard.  Look at where similar papers have been sent in the past.  If you're writing an appropriate literature review to put your paper in context, it should be an easy task to pick the journal where your work would be most at home.

Basically, the Lacks' were unaware of Henrietta's contribution to science, and even after they found out her cells were still alive, and doctors proceeded to run tests on the surviving Lackses themselves, they remained oblivious as to what any of this actually meant: no doctor even bothered to explain to the family--none of whom had a high school education--what a cell even was. This last part of the book is more emotional than the preceding sections and all took place within the space between the knowledge and opportunities of the scientists who work with HeLa and Henrietta's actual children.

Churches, relics, idols, etc., are all physical objects in religion, yes; but they are all products of individual religions, and not likely to yield any evidence on the origin of religion as a whole. Keep in mind that religion and the belief in the supernatural precede recorded history.

So does natural selection and abiogenesis. But we still study them with science.

&gt; IMO, the closest one can come to scientific approach to OP's question would be through the social science of anthropology. I've heard several good lectures from anthropologists over the years that have had many good theories about religion, but none that would claim to have an answer on the subject of its origin or ""cause.""

I agree that the scientific answer is murky. That does not mean that the question is unscientific. Many scientific questions do not yet have clear answers.

&gt; For example, an anthropologist could speculate on the genetic advantages of a population that had religious rules against incest. He could likewise point to the benefits to that population that resulted from the social order and control afforded by religion, or to the medical benefits of religious restriction of consumption of bottom-feeders and other unclean foods. These are based upon scientific principles, but still amount to theories and speculation. Interesting for lectures and discussion among scientists, but not likely to yield any concrete answers. 

You can't know what science will discover. For example, religion-oriented parts of the brain, or religion-oriented genes. Or patterns for which cultures develop which kinds of religions.

&gt; That's why I say it is more of a philosophical question.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","With my daughter we took her nap away at age 4 b/c the only preschool I could get her into was an afternoon one.  It took a few weeks to adjust, but she's totally fine w/ it now.  

My son went through many ups and downs with naps, but now is back to going down for nap (around 1pm-3/4pm with a firm 8pm bedtime) really well.  He really fiercely (!!) fought the nap time for several weeks, and still whines about it on occasion, but I insist.  I will read him books, sing songs and even lay down for a little while if it helps him wind down.  I found that THIS was his real problem, he was loosing the ability to wind down and lay still to fall asleep during the day.  So, I tried to help him regain this skill.  It's a little harder b/c he knows his big sis is down stairs playing w/o him.

I know he needs his nap still b/c if I were to let him skip and he were on a car drive at ~3pm or later, he would definitely fall asleep in the car.  That's my litmus test...  

As they say - every kid is different.

**Belief** in this context means you support the legitimacy of a claim (1) and you have either **some supporting** scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale, AND/OR **no conflicting** scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale. For example, I believe so-and-so will recover from an illness, because of their prognosis and treatment.

It is possible that faith and belief can mean the same thing in the event that there is no scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale for the argument or counter-argument. My interpretation of (1) is that someone lacks the faith in god's existence, which is when someone ""believes"" (using the word loosely here) that god exists and either doesn't care or is unable to defend that faith-based pro-god's existence position using science, evidence, and/or logic.","1306887639"

As RangerSix said, the tactics are quite ... persuasive. I don't know how others react, but sitting through it, you kind of want to make the purchase out of pity and also they do have you momentarily convinced that it is a good deal.

If you haven't done it before, the standard pitch has two parts. First, they give a presentation to all the marks, I mean customers, then they assign you to salespeople for one-on-one pitches. What worked for my parents one time is that they mentioned a negative experience a relative had with a time share, and after 10 minutes of the saleswoman trying to change their mind, they were free to go.

The biggest lesson to learn is to not be afraid to appear rude. The way they get you is by having you feel like you owe them or feel pity (e.g. you feel some obligation because of the free/discounted trip or whatever). You also have to consider what 2 hours of you and your spouse's time is worth on a vacation. For instance, I've heard of some really cheap-ass timeshare gimmicks, where you spend 2 hours to get a raffle ticket. Not worth it. A free cabin when skiing, or even a boat? Go for it.

My interpretation of (1) is that someone believes god doesn't exist and is able/willing to argue the case scientifically, evidentiarily, and/or logically.","1306887653"

So if you trust the camera's meter, you can work much faster. Instead of worrying about absolute settings, the exposure lock button and exposure compensation dial become your best friends.

But photography is a deeply personal activity and there are many ways of achieving the same results. If full manual is working for you - and you're getting results that you're happy with - keep doing whatever you're doing.","1306887657"

"canada","t5_2qh68","There are clear divisions between the responsibilities of the legislatures at the federal and provincial level. While some are ambiguous, such as health care and transportation, for the most part each deals with different issues.

The federal government has no say in how the Quebec legislature determines its composition. It could, but won't, move back to having a dual legislature like it did prior to 1968. The federal government has no business interfering in how the provinces decide to make laws within provincial jurisdiction. 

If you're advocating for the abolishment of the Senate I would contend that you wish to see the office of the Prime Minister become even more powerful. Over the course of Canada's existence the Senate has done substantial work on legislation, often improving it. Having longer terms in the Senate allows for greater continuity and less volatility than what currently exists in the House of Commons. ","1306887671"

As for tl;dr . . . I was not using that charming little phrase myself.  I was saying I disapprove of it.  I find that almost every important insight I've gained has come from reading, so I don't like the laziness of not bothering to read something that someway addresses somebody's criticism of an idea.  I've seen people post tl;dr to my posts before, and in no way bothering to examine what was actually said.

As for your last point, I hope you take some encouragement from Al Gore's _The Assault on Reason_.  He felt that the Internet is a gateway to a community of people to can organize change and advance discourse.  The Internet is similar to what the American founding fathers understood as the entry ticket to public discourse: literacy.  If you could read and write, you could create pamphlets and participate.  

TV is one-way and has dominated mass communication for a long time.  The Internet is a tool that shows promise.  Maybe it's too late for all this.  George Carlin was quite candid that he thought humanity was ""circling the drain"" and there was simply nothing that could be done to stop it.

I say that you have more credibility because if you were a writer and activist in the 80's, then you have much more experience than I do (I was born in '82).  But never forget how infectious and tenacious an idea can be once it catches on.  ","1306887675"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","**Lack of belief in god's existence** (1)

**God** in this context can represent the Yahweh, the abstract deistic creator (be it interventionist or non-interventionist), and/or multiple gods.

**Existence** in this context means there is a god in any realm of the physical, metaphysical, spirtual, etc...

**Belief** in this context means you support the legitimacy of a claim (1) and you have either **some supporting** scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale, AND/OR **no conflicting** scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale. For example, I believe so-and-so will recover from an illness, because of their prognosis and treatment.

To the contrary, **faith** is simply that you support the legitimacy of a claim (1) in the event that there is either **some conflicting** scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale, AND/OR **no supporting** scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale. For example, I have faith that so-and-so will reawaken from their coma, despite the doctors' grim prognosis.

It is possible that faith and belief can mean the same thing in the event that there is no scientific, evidentiary, and/or logical rationale for the argument or counter-argument. My interpretation of (1) is that someone lacks the belief in god's existence, which is when someone believes that god exists and is able/willing to argue the case for god's existence scientifically, evidentiarily, and/or logically.","1306887707"

1. too much god damn money. 
2. when i was involved my life revolved around paintball. I never had a girlfriend and if i did she was not hot.
3. i was complete shit in school because all i worried about was paintball.

Im not going to lie, i was pretty good at my peak.
Was it fun? Yea.
Would i do it agian?
No.

i might pick up a gun and play some recball here and there in the next couple years but i will never compete again.

Its just not for me anymore.

As for your question though, yes the ""hk"" clique is what i am referring to.
As in, the 12 year olds who talk to shit to everyone because they think they look good with the cloths their parents buy them(and 90% of the time all those kids suck dick at paintball)

I used to rep HK when I played. about a year or 2 before i stopped i stopped ""repping"" it because i saw through the bullshit and actually met half of the kids who regularly post on that forum.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I studied for software engineering. IMO, the difference is like in construction. A builder (programmer) vs the architect and everything else (software engineer). It's just that to be a software engineer you have to know how to do good programming and many things else. 

Imagine a company requires a accounting system. A software engineer, would gather the requirements. Analyze them with the client. Do the technical requirements. (In what plattform? Scalability? Portability? Critical System?) Calculate how much would it cost and in how long. Do the technical design. (Planning how is going to be programmed how many classes, and how they are gonna interact). Design test cases and acceptance tests. Plan the tasks. Do the programming. Test the software (stress tests, compatbility tests, integration tests) and review it with the client. Of course this is done by many software engineers. So even if programming is not your stronghold you can still be a good software engineer if you are good on something else.","1306887727"

But their ""packs"" inevitably disperse as they move away from the urban centers.  Additionally, ten zombies are easy to take, assuming they are the shambling kind.  If you are any good, you can stake out the grocery store, sniper the ones outside and you're probably left with only one or two inside, depending on the size of the store.  It's probably actually safer to raid a residential house where there are few people and rooms.  You can't take all the food at a grocery store anyway.

Additionally, you only have to last as long as it takes for a human body to rot.  After that, you organize the survivors and mop up.  But then, it depends on the kind of zombie you're fighting.","1306887734"

Also, you were probably not being serious, but creating an r/fixie would definitely just be the cause of a lot of trouble. You would have to appoint mods to filter through both r/FGB and r/fixie and any post which was moved from the former to the later would basically be labeled as a ""stupid, ignorant question"" which will only cause more threads and arguments about something that ultimately really has nothing to do with bicycles at all.","1306887767"

I'm not taking anything away from Wilt or his skill (he's one of the best centers, if not THE best center ever), but that particular ordeal seems pretty shady. For a long time, both teams would foul each other, the opponents to stop Wilt from getting the ball and Wilt's team to get him the ball.

The game was out of reach already, yet Wilt stayed in, which is pretty unsportsmanlike if you ask me. I think it diminishes the accomplishment a great deal. For example, I think if Kobe stayed in that one game against the Mavs where he scored 60 in 3 quarters, he would have had another 80 point game...but I digress.","1306887769"

*Falling ~200 feet down a cliff.  I was saved by the avalanche i started which provided a nice snowy cushion at the bottom.

*Went off the road (passenger in a car) while cornering way to fast and the car glanced off of a light pole, taking out the side mirror (on my side).  Then managed to stop about 2 meters away from the edge of a 4 lane highway we would have plowed across.

*Hitting a tree doing about 35 Km/h on my mountain bike (1st helmet I wrecked).

*Accidentally stopping for a drink (of water) only to realize I had just put myself between a momma black bear and her two cubs.  Never pedalled so fast in my life. 

*Catapulting myself over my handlebars into another tree (helmet #2).

*Loosing control at the bottom of a big paved hill when I tried to turn and hit a gravel patch.  Probably doing about 60 Km/h.  Me and the bike slid into a big concrete curb.  (Helmet #3).

In every case I walked away with only scratches and scrapes. I've never broken a bone.  This is why I try to be a good person- I need all the freaking real-life Karma I can get, because I must owe the universe quite a bit.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","No offence but can you (we / them / everybody) stop calling it ""Panic Breaking"". You're trying to do an Emergency Stop and all Panic does is imply lack of control ;)

When breaking (and especially emergency breaking) you want to be using mostly your front and a little on the back to stop it trying to overtake the front. If you use too much on the back then it tends to lock up and slide side to side (and then you're outta control and potentially ruining a good tire).

The other things I think are worth bearing in mind are that lots of riders tend to panic and pull both the break and the clutch at the same time. Engine breaking is a good way of dispersing energy, so don't pull the clutch until the last second (to avoid stall). In some situations I've found myself stomping down on the gear change (without hitting the clutch) at vaguely appropriate speeds to give me more engine breaking, however there is chance that it will cause you to loose control of the back wheel. It sounds like you're doing this at the moment... Its quite surprising how easy it is to lock the rear wheel and not notice until you stop travelling in a straight line.

If you have ABS then you can get away with slamming on the breaks hard but if you don't then this is a good recipe for things getting messy (especially in poor traction conditions). If you lock your wheels then you've lost traction on the road, and at that point the breaking stops being optimal. Cadence Breaking is a technique for feathering your breaks (eg releasing them slightly just before they lock up). This gives you more control and more breaking force.
-On a side note, even if you do have ABS, its useful to practise being without it... I did my test on a bike with ABS and then didn't think the first time I went out on my new ""big bike"" that didn't have it :(

Breaking whilst turning (or turning whilst breaking) usually gets messy. If you have to suddenly change direction whilst you're in the middle of trying to slow down, then I'd recommend releasing the breaks whilst you try and ""turn"". Locking up usually hurts...

(This is my own conjecture) Yes you can turn tighter at lower speeds, however it's also worth noting that if you're in the middle of a turn and start breaking then all the forces go funny and the bike is going to try and rise upright (or just lowside and wipe out) and more force will end up going forward before the main breaking takes effect. In practise, if you're cutting a turn a little bit tight and suddenly panic and try and slow down, then it can go even wider than trying to keep your line.

Emergency breaking happens, but try your best not to panic; even when things are going to hell.","1306887829"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I think you're overestimating how much China cares about North Korea. 

It's a satellite state, only so far as they keep themselves on the chain that China is holding them by. If the North were to collapse in on itself, or perform any sort of agressive act that goes beyond the skirmishes they've engaged in so far, China would cease to support them financially. 

China may be North Korea's only ally at this point, but I think that China also has become a nation that knows a thing or two about keeping itself afloat. 40 years ago, you would be totally right, but now, China has far more interest in the United States as it's chief trading partner, and the country that owes them the most money through debt. A proxy war with America would be silly.

I think a more probable ""worst case scenario"" would be civil war in North Korea in which the South, and the U.S. become involved, but China does not involve itself in. I could see China essentially having a policy of holding its border, wherein any refugees that try to cross into China would be denied, and any military action that strayed into China would be met with aggression.

At the same time any such civil war would probably be between competing military factions. The smarter faction would simply say to South Korea: ""Back us, and we'll give up after this is all over."" 

A war between South Korea and North Korea would be a bad thing. The U.S. would be involved. Assuming China does not support the North, the U.S. would have to conduct a rapid campaign of decimating the North's ill equipped armored forces, air forces, and navy. As much manpower as the North has, their only strengths are their closeness to Seoul, and the aforementioned large number of ground troops. Their lack of any sort of modern military technology, using what is more often than not 40+ year old tech would mean an easy win. Modified Soviet tank designs and Mig 21s would be no match against Abrams tanks and a carrier full of American warplanes. 

At the end of the day I think the best we could hope for is this: 

A power vacuum which leads to the government collapsing East Germany style.

South Korean forces (with U.S. backing) move in, secure the country, and it's eventually incorporated into a new Korea (and I can imagine the months of footage, documents, and horrifying information pouring out as concentration camps are liberated, the malnourished masses of the incredibly impoverished are finally fed, and the for the first time in decades North Koreans will know the reality of the west).

Some people thing if a Church is big and has a nice sound system, there must be something wrong theologically. Strangely, by the same reasoning, they should have a problem with Piper. Going to an ""Armenian""-leaning Church, the complainers do also have a problem with him. At least they're consistent. :).

I knew that it might be something serious but I was also thinking that if this turns out to be some stupid thing then I'll be pissed she made me leave. We get half way home and I finally get her to tell me why we left. She received a phone call that said my mother had been shot but she didn't know anything else. Being that my mother lived in a whole different country we were heading home just to sit by the phone. The whole drive I started praying to a God I doubted. We get home and I run in and my other aunts are there. They tell me my mother was shot but last they heard she was ok. I almost collapsed on the floor. It was the single most terrifying hour of my life. She'd been held up at gun point trying to enter her garage and the men had shot through the window when she tried to drive off. She'd gotten out of the car afterward, gave them everything and tried to run in the opposite direction to lead them away form my sister who was upstairs. There's a scar on the bridge of her nose from where the glass hit her. But that's all. She moved here to the states and we live together.","1306887836"

"investing","t5_2qhhq","I think both of those things are actually basically true. There are big caveats to both of them, however, and I think most of the caveats relate to franchise companies that are relatively new.
Regarding the royalty, one problem is that if the parent co. gets any royalties from a franchisee, it's more than zero. It's almost never a progressive scale - so that even if you're losing money, the parent co. earns something. That is a disincentive to care (much) whether you're making much money.

As for the upfront fee, usually a decent chunk goes to just a straight licensing fee, say $25 to 50 grand. Which again, to a new company, might be significant when they get it from a dozen or so franchisees.

Two more things to beware of: new franchise companies are mainly looking to expand quickly so that brand awareness is increased. Half of what these people are selling you is their brand, and if they can recruit enough franchisees quickly, they can build their brand and not have to take the time to build it themselves. 

The other thing: be absolutely frightened of companies that sell franchises on behalf of the parent company. These companies only make money when a new franchisee opens, they typically get half of whatever the signup/license fee is. They have no incentive whatsoever to see that you're making a good decision, only to sell as many franchises as possible, so they will talk up your franchise like it's the greatest idea ever, and they will always phrase things so that if you have problems/don't make money, it's your fault (""You'll make a lot if you're dedicated enough and are willing to put in the hours..."").

All in all, I think buying a franchise might be a good idea, as long as you have worked in the industry a little bit, are really sure that you're emotionally the right kind of person to own a business, and don't get sucked into the overly optimistic hype.","1306887839"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Former claims adjuster for a major insurance company here:
From the sounds of it you will be under your damage deductible.  If that is true, you will be held responsible for all the damages to your car until it reaches the deductible. You don't HAVE to pay to fix your car, so no money spent there.

As for the other car I would have them go to a body shop of their choice and a body shop of your choice and compare quotes.  That way you can get the better deal.  From the sounds of it (and I'm going on a baseball sized dent in a plastic bumper without any cracks and no paint damage), you're looking at around $500 depending on the standard rates in your area.   They should be able to jump pop the thing out with a heat gun as long as there is no paint damage.  If there is paint damage you will see a much heftier bill because they will remove the bumper, repair the damage and replace the same, raising the labor costs.

The real son-of-a-bitch will be if there are reported injuries.  Were there any injuries listed on the PR.  Im not sure how litigious TX is but here in FL, it's out of control.  We have lawyers going through public police reports on file, finding any listed injuries and soliciting them if they were not at fault, then showing them movies about ""what can happen if unknown injuries go untreated."" Then they send them to the Chiropractor they are in cahoots with and the insurance money is gone like that (snap).  Its a fucking cluster fuck down here.  

Point being, your insurance company will cover it if they need to, but depending on your company and claims history it could cause your premium to increase.   If you have a clean claims history then you may see a small increase but not a bank buster, especially if they don't have to pay out on anything.

The real beauty of your situation is that it was a rental car, so no one really gives a fuck about the car itself, I just hope you hit an honest, healthy person.","1306887840"

"math","t5_2qh0n","One obvious reason to care about field extensions arises from the complex numbers, which are a field extension of the real field. In this case we can see very geometrically things that we cannot see in the real field alone, and sometimes knowing that something holds in the complex field tells us something about the real field itself, as when real definite integrals are computed using the technique of residues in the complex plane.

As for why we don't always work inside the algebraic closure, it's because in a sense the totality of ways that a field can be extended carries extra information. Dually, examining all subgroups of a group gives extra information about the group. This arises in the classic Galois connection associating fields intermediate between a base field and a finite Galois extension with subgroups of the Galois group of the Galois extension. This connection can be used to prove some classic results, which others here have commented on.

I'll instead say that one way to detect that this connector between two categories is fundamental is to notice that this same connection arises elsewhere in settings that feel unconnected. And we find indeed the same sort of Galois connections in the topology of covering spaces: given a sufficiently nice topological space (roughly, one that has a universal covering), there is a bijection between (isomorphism classes of) (path-connected) covering spaces and (conjugacy classes of) subgroups of the fundamental group of the base space.","1306887895"

First year I didn't even know what BASc, BSc, BA, honours, etc mean. Things got really shitty into advanced math courses, I was fourth year and there was no light at the end of the tunnel.Now I'm in process of transferring to BSc computer science which is realistic for me.

So yeah, if you pick a new program or college, make sure you have a plan for all your years of study. A very, very precise plan. Don't deviate from it no matter what. Keep track of your GPA. You should know what it is at any given moment. Go to profs, often, make them remember your name. Many marks are lost due to poor marking so appeal everything, even if you are happy with it.

That is just from my own experience. I had to learn those things myself because there was no one to explain them to me.","1306887900"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Well, it's slow right now so I'll break it down.

&gt; With the capped attack speed you will most likely not have the ~200 base damage

Vayne has 183.5 attack damage at level 18 with Final Hour and zero items, runes, or masteries.  This is the best innate attack damage in the game except for Master Yi with Double Wuju Style (224).

&gt; If your attack speed is capped, 2.5, then you are getting silver bolt every .833 seconds

1.2 seconds : 2.5 attacks / second = 3 attacks / 1.2 seconds

Max cooldown on Tumble is also 1.2 seconds.  Silver Bolts doesn't scale while Tumble has retarded scaling (more to follow) and moves you almost 75% the distance of Ezreal's Arcane Shift.

Auto attacks scale with an AD ratio of (1 + (1 + Critical Damage/100) * (Critical Chance/100)).  This can be multiplied by 1.04 if you have Havoc.  Let's ignore the possibility of Critical Damage runes, but acknowledge that they would be useful on Vayne.  In this case an auto attack has a maximum AD ratio of 3.744.  What is retarded is that Vayne has an additional 75% bonus damage on Tumble that no other carry has access to giving it a maximum AD ratio of **4.52**.  Forget attack speed as a primary stat, Vayne has the *best scaling ability in the game* at the same time as having *the highest innate attack damage* outside of Master Yi's nifty trick.   At level 18 with the Offensive Mastery tree and *only 3830g*, Infinity Edge, Vayne has 266.5 attack damage and Tumble has an AD ratio of 2.27.  Before mitigation auto attacks deal 472 physical damage, Tumble deals 605 physical damage (2s cooldown), and you've still got 6000 gold to spend.  ***Holy Fuck***.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Even above his transcendent talent and insane physical attributes, MJ benefited from several changes to basketball and the NBA. First off, he didn't explode until the wheels had fallen off of some of the powerhouses of the 80's (Showtime Lakers, Bird Celtics, Erving 76ers, Bad Boys Pistons), leaving them in rebuilding mode. Second, he was probably the first NBA athlete to reach such a high level of media exposure, as evident in the creation of luxury basketball shoes and the GOAT sports movie, Space Jam.

But above all that, MJ benefited from the rapid expansion of the NBA that occured during his career (by my count, the creation of about 6 new teams). Due to multiple expansion drafts, the NBA saw the refinement of a few teams into highly talented squads (Bulls, Suns, Jazz, etc.), at the expense of new expansion teams, which had historically terrible rosters (Wolves, Raptors, amongst others).

Of course, MJ still managed to vanquish those insanely elite 90's teams, and that's why he's considered the GOAT. But some of his other records (72-10 season in particular, in my opinion) definitely received a boost from playing in a highly imbalanced league.

Edit: This is based on readings of NBA history, since I was a bit too young to fully appreciate 90's basketball. So I might have the wrong idea; let me know if I made any blatant mistakes.","1306887906"

Two things really:  there seems to be a strong sense of entitlement in these threads, most ppl believe they're owed a job. ""I went to college, got that Bxxxx, give me a job!"" It doesn't work that way. You've got a earn that job as you're not only competing with a local market but the whole world. 
The second thing that REALLY bothers me is that there is no sense of entrepreneurialism here, ppl are waiting for someone to give them a job. What happened to making your own opportunities, making your own job? Information on anything has never been easier to find, setting up your own small business (on the 'net) is has barely any upfront cost and is so low risk. And the learning experience is life changing, it changes your whole perspective on working, understanding costs, management, etc... once you have solid understanding of these you'll be vital in any business.
In this world today: if you're job can be broken down into simple steps or put in a manual you can find some one else (or a team even) that can do it cheaper. You need to remain innovative, driven to learn (in our ever changing world) and strive for efficiency.

He's not considering your feelings, OP. Committed, considerate and self-confident SOs do so automatically, of their own accord. He's manipulating yours to make himself feel better. 

... and getting naked massages? I'm don't even ... 

OP, the only reason you are putting up with all this is because you lack a bit of self-confidence yourself. Partners in any longer relationship tend to have similar confidence levels, though the insecurities may differ. 

Please step up here and make decisions consistent with the highest self-esteem. Tell him to put a cork in it, and buy a back massager.

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;One thing was that some of those kids were in fact marginally developing

Well, the boundaries are fluid sometimes and it depends on the ""margin"", but in general once it gets  truly noticeable they get covered. At a latter age they can go topless again, as adults, but that is a different matter.

&gt;Guys can go topless, they have breasts too, they just don't get bigger with age

Well, yes, but the level of sexualisation that female breasts possess is not symmetrical with male breasts. It can be nature, it can be culture, it can anything, but it is what it is.

&gt;It's just a body part, if you are retarded enough to sexualize a child, topless or not, I am sure the swim suit will suffice anyway.

You are right, and until a decade ago I remember seeing toddlers in the beach (in Spain and Portugal, but could be more widespread) completely naked. Fuck, *I* have pictures of myself completely naked in the beach (well, with a hat on. Useful, that) during the 80's it was apparently something that parents did without great concern when dealing with toddlers (I mean &lt;3 year olds here, perhaps a bit less on average).

With the passing of time and the overall higher visibility of paedophilia it all but disappeared.

&gt;So to your point, morality is morality in my mind, I would much rather, if I had a kid, for her to be completely naked around a moral man than fully clothed around an immoral pervert.

Quite. People however tend to conform to societal norms and be rather defensive about how they present their kids, especially when confronted with all the talk about child molesters. In case of doubt, better to cover it up, it's I guess the common feeling.","1306887971"

You can also verify where all of your loans are using this website: https://www.nslds.ed.gov and type in all your information (SS, DOB, First 2 Initials of your last name, PIN)

I also spoke with my Dad who advised me to write a check out (with the specific Loan ID in the memo) and send it in.  Supposedly, this requires them to apply that to the specific loan with which the Loan ID is listed.

"golf","t5_2qhcs","it depends on what your goals are. blades give you a lot of feedback, and you are forced to hit it dead centre everytime. i think they are good and conducive towards improving your game for beginners with an incredible amount of patience. but if you get it off the centre, then the ball doesn't go anywhere. it has zero forgiveness unlike the perimeteral weighted clubs which are clubs that are for beginners. if you want to enjoy a round of golf, while learning the game, then the taylor made burners are fine. if you don't mind shanking the ball every single shot and you have the superhuman patience to keep training till your swing is perfect, then blades (a cheap and old set) would be good for you. then again, they aren't a beginners club.

I finished around 11, and I knew that tickets went on sale at 12, so I ran over to Steve's on University Ave and jumped in at the end of the line.  I was late so I didn't get my hopes up too much, but there was still a chance.  I waited in line for 45 minutes, getting closer and closer to the door, only to have them run out of tickets TWO people in front of me.

The remaining line was only about eight people, so I thought one of the other locations might have had a smaller turnout.  I decided that Steve's in Middleton would be my best bet, since it was the farthest location from downtown that would be selling tickets.  I jumped in my truck and drove out there, and lo and behold, they were still selling tickets.  I got in line and waited for another 45 minutes only to have them run out of tickets TWO people in front of me AGAIN.

Frustrated and with no hope I went home to prepare to put my check in the mail for the drawing.  After I browsed reddit for a while to calm down, I checked the Great Taste website and saw a tweet that their location on Johnson St had had 12 tickets left over... over two hours prior, not even worth checking out at that point.

I've met more self-important freshman engineering majors than I've met self-important graduate students.

Back on topic, I applied to all sorts of jobs. I've got certifications in other fields beyond my own, even spent 4 months jumping through hoops to get licensed as a teacher before discovering they were axing teachers left and right. I had a decent chance at getting a job since they've gone into a mode where they fire people after their first year and hire some new people to replace them, repeating over and over, but the only way to get a job for a year in that cycle is to know people - and despite my best efforts at whoring myself out to anyone that would let me sit down in their office that came to nothing.

At some point you need a job of some kind just to pay the costs of driving around applying to jobs. I have friends who can only apply to jobs online because they've got no means to get around to ask about jobs - and you look real impressive walking in for an application covered in sweat because you've hiked around 10-20 miles on foot in 100* weather.

If you actually read the source you linked to, you'll notice they only condemn unhealthy levels of thinness, where lack of body fat puts a persons health at risk.

As a feminist, I believe that women are constrained by unrealistic expectations of how they should look and what they should do to maintain their bodies. I think it's unfair to say that a woman *cannot be beautiful/successful/good* unless she rips hair out, puts tons of makeup on her face, and has perky tits. However, I'm not saying that women who do these things aren't beautiful, and nor am I saying that a healthy body isn't something to be strived for - for people of all genders. A healthy body looks different for each person, we're not all clones, and I think demonizing women who are healthy and beautiful because their bodies don't fit the current western beauty standard is sad. I don't want women to be fat, I want them to be fit and healthy. I just refuse to condemn women because they don't look like the young, white, rich, thin, flawless ladies in the magazines.","1306887999"

Since they make us dependent on cars we suburban-dwellers hardly walk anywhere, which means we're less healthy, and since we have to drive more and frequently get stuck in traffic, we're more stressed.

They also, as I said before, consume massive amounts of land, which is bad for local ecosystems, and in turn, bad for our well being, as well as destroying a lot of farmland which causes food shortages and other problems.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Like I said, its a middle of the run panel, German, with top warranties across the board. Suntech we can get for 1.70 but we dont touch them. You can find chinese panels for cheap, but we dont touch those either. Warranty &amp; performance issues.

As far as pricing for CA, you are looking at nothing cheaper than 5.25 from a reputable contractor using good quality materials and taking all liability. 6.00-6.25 for groud mounts, a little cheaper if large sized res system.

I also mentioned Evergreen leaving the US, leaving behind tax incentives and loans defaulted, so warranties may be an issue, but overall a decent panel.

Roof warranties may not be important for some DIYers. Most people feel better with a contractor doing the roof penetrations, electrical work, conduit runs, etc.

2.50 is cheap, regarless. Copper wire is getting more expensive by the day, and may not be substantial if it is a short run. Contractors are paying 1.80 per watt, with discounts on large orders.

We do not buy from sunelec as they sometimes sell off-warranty/remanufactured/blemished/reconditioned modules which will not carry warranties. Same thing with inverters.

A solid contractor will put the best system available at the cheapest price with some profit in it. There are enough contractors in our area to maintain healthy prices, enough new, small ones looking for work to keep prices lower than normal.

Go ahead and buy sunelec or chinese, but beware. SolarCity went cheap a while back and ended up in a huge mess. REC as well, had to deal with a big recall from chinese modules. Cheap is not always better. 

Just to keep in mind, this is a system that is supposed to be in place producing money for 25+ years. If you think the savings are worth it, go for it, but beware.

Also, we've had calls on DIYers looking for us to do the ""final 20%"" work and we will not touch those jobs. Maybe an electrician will do it, but not a solar contractor. Taking on the liability of your wiring, or maybe assuming liability from your work will keep us away, and warranties can be an issue in the future. Best of luck!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Short answer: saying ""that's so retarded"" is **not** as bad as saying ""that's so gay.""

Long answer: unlike homosexuality, mental retardation is by and large a negative quality. It has an overwhelmingly adverse effect (save in the rare cases of savants, whose images are usually not the ones being invoked by the use of the words ""retard"" and ""retarded"" in the context you're talking about). So for one to say ""that's gay"" in the same way he might say ""that's retarded"" would be to imply that the two are somehow comparable in desirability and/or effect. It is this assumption of the inherent defectiveness of homosexuality that is offensive.

I'm not saying it shouldn't be considered insensitive to throw around ""retard"" as a descriptive word when the user really has little-to-no understanding of people with actual disabilities. There isn't really any defense for the thoughtless exploitation of real issues such as those faced by handicapped people. But, in *some* cases, it might truly be appropriate to describe a ill-conceived action as retarded, i.e. equivalent of something a retard would do, given his/her impairment(s). The same simply can't be said of ""gay.""","1306888006"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","So now we have moved into the realm of individuals as adding value because of the coincidental (but not necessary) feelings others might have for them. I do not think you will get out cleanly here in either direction you could take this. First, people really care about animals at times, and genuinely do so more than a person or a mentally retarded person for instance. It appears to have a lot to do with proximity. A pet dog is probably worth more to some people than some stranger they haven't met. How does this calculus work then?

Second, supposing a person has no friends and no family. Now you are in a hole. We can stipulate out of your argument here by hypothetically supposing an individual who does not have anyone at all who actually even knows who they are for instance (except say the nurse who changes his clothes, but cares nothing for him). This will create problems for you, because what obligation do we have to treat them any certain way?

Once you get how to pack tangiers you will never go back.

Tangiers Phunnel bowls are the best bowls by far. I prefer the small or mini(discontinued) for everyday use as they'll last 2-5 hours.

The best coals are definitely golden canary, you can find them at ultimate hookah for about 9.50 a pack with weekend discounts, and are what is the type of coal (japanese coals) recommended by the grandmaster of death himself, eric of tangiers. He uses Fumari Japanese coals at his lounge now, but golden canaries are essentially the same, and what he used to use.

As for vortex bowls. It originally was Erics design. He discarded it due to the fact it never smoked as well as the Phunnel. Then a couple years back I believe it was Sahara Smoke began making the vortex bowl. Eric didn't care because he knew it was a sub par design compared to the phunnel. If you meet eric and pick his brain about tangiers, smoking, hell life in general, you'll realize how much of a perfectionist he is and why the vortex bowl if it didn't get his okay, simply isn't worth it.

As for hoses, the OP is right. Narbish's are the best in my opinion. They definitely win for best build quality and draw for any washable hose.

How the hell is it a false dichotomy? You cannot be both a theist and an atheist at the same time. That's a contradiction. 

&gt;SO if 'therichclique' honestly doesn't know, won't/can't decide whether there is a god or not - he is somehow atheist? 

He would be an apatheist, which is an atheistic position, yes. 

Again, atheism, literally means NOT THEISM. Just like asymmetrical means not symmetrical, and atypical means not typical. 

Either you hold a belief in a god (which would make you a theist), or you don't (which would make you an atheist).

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","&gt; Sunni Islam, pretty much the middle path that hasn't broken off.

I hope you are you aware of Sufis, Deobandis, Barelvis, Salafis and the differences between them (and how they label some of the others false). And, most likely, you might be saying the Shias got it right had you been born a Shia. Or perhaps an Ahmadi.  So, there are a lot of disagreements, with each of them proclaiming themselves followers of ""true"" Islam. They all base their beliefs on the same unchanged texts but interpret differently. In the end, most people will proclaim whatever they are following is ""true"" Islam. Having the most followers does not necessarily make it the right version. 

&gt; Islam pretty much says the purpose of life is to worship God, live a good life, and reproduce as to advance as a species in the world.

Well, the only purpose of life is to worship God--everything else you said after that is due to religious injunctions. There is a certain freedom in how to live out the life (be a doctor, fight crime) but the purpose has to be worshiping God. I hope you remember the hadith about 3 people who were punished despite doing good deeds, because their deeds were not for the sake of God. So, every Muslim has the same purpose in life--to worship God. Also, ""live a good life"" is constrained by the Islamic definition of ""good"", so it cannot be just anything a person wants.","1306888022"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Like I said, its a middle of the run panel, German, with top warranties across the board. Suntech we can get for 1.70 but we dont touch them. You can find chinese panels for cheap, but we dont touch those either. Warranty &amp; performance issues.

As far as pricing for CA, you are looking at nothing cheaper than 5.25 from a reputable contractor using good quality materials and taking all liability. 6.00-6.25 for groud mounts, a little cheaper if large sized res system.

I also mentioned Evergreen leaving the US, leaving behind tax incentives and loans defaulted, so warranties may be an issue, but overall a decent panel.

Roof warranties may not be important for some DIYers. Most people feel better with a contractor doing the roof penetrations, electrical work, conduit runs, etc.

2.50 is cheap, regarless. Copper wire is getting more expensive by the day, and may not be substantial if it is a short run. Contractors are paying 1.80 per watt, with discounts on large orders.

We do not buy from sunelec as they sometimes sell off-warranty/remanufactured/blemished/reconditioned modules which will not carry warranties. Same thing with inverters.

A solid contractor will put the best system available at the cheapest price with some profit in it. There are enough contractors in our area to maintain healthy prices, enough new, small ones looking for work to keep prices lower than normal.

Go ahead and buy sunelec or chinese, but beware. SolarCity went cheap a while back and ended up in a huge mess. REC as well, had to deal with a big recall from chinese modules. Cheap is not always better. 

Just to keep in mind, this is a system that is supposed to be in place producing money for 25+ years. If you think the savings are worth it, go for it, but beware.

Also, we've had calls on DIYers looking for us to do the ""final 20%"" work and we will not touch those jobs. Maybe an electrician will do it, but not a solar contractor. Taking on the liability of your wiring, or maybe assuming liability from your work will keep us away, and warranties can be an issue in the future. Best of luck!

I see the coal v. nuclear debate in this frame: while climate change will disrupt the planet's ecosystem and perhaps make areas unsuitable for large scale human habitation - no areas will become outright deadly poisonous because of coal use.

The mosque, which has an overview of the entire city from its tower, is basically right in front of the insurgent main base. If you go up there with a sniper rifle/marksman/SAW, you can easily pick off entire squads spawning. Makes it a fantastic place to be a sniper.

However, you also can't see directly below you and can only hear the enemy approaching as they climb the ladder. That's bad, you don't want close-quarters as a marksman.

So one guy comes up the ladder after me, but he does a stupid thing and announces his presence by shooting up the ladder first, trying to catch me looking down. I position myself at the peak with my rifle out, he pops his head up, and BAM one kill.

Then another guy comes up. He does the same thing, BAM another kill. 

Then another.

And another. 

I figure that I'm dead if I stay up there because they have line of sight with RPGs from their main base. I start climbing down, run into another guy, slide down the ladder, pick him off from the base with my rifle, and run like hell down into the belly of the mosque.

As soon as I reach the stairwell, a guy enters through the bottom door trying to get me. I shoot him with the rifle right as he opens fire at me and catch a bullet, going BLOODYSCREENSOREAL. My squad is outside of the mosque and across the street and I have to get to the medic if I want to survive another minute. 

Two guys died as I was descending the stairwell, another in the main lobby. I run out the door, shoot at but miss the guy watching it, take another bullet (now black and white), and somehow manage to take him out as he runs in for a stab. 

At that point, gary (a dumptruck filled with artillery shells) detonates on an APC that was driving along the main road and I just kind of randomly die. ","1306888028"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Just curious, would you agree that tasers at close range would be more of an appropriate choice, as long as the other person isn't carrying a firearm of course?

Absolutely.  The problem with a situation like this is that the police officer's traditional less-than-lethal options (pepper spray, nightstick) require the officer to move within striking range of the suspect's knife.  Tasers have a longer range than those options, allowing the officer to subdue a suspect without resorting to lethal force.

[Unfortunately, Officer Birk probably wouldn't have used a taser even if he had been carrying one when he confronted Mr. Williams.](https://www.kuow.org/program.php?id=21469)  Seattle police officers are trained to only use tasers against armed suspects if there is another officer present to provide ""lethal cover"" in case the less-than-lethal option fails.  I understand SPD's reasoning for this policy, but it still seems to diminish what I feel is the best reason to equip officers with tasers in the first place.

&gt;As you can tell I try to find ways around a police officer killing another person. The reason is in a situation like that you don't know the person's story. Perhaps the person needs counceling because they are mentally unstable, perhaps they've gone through a tough patch of sorts, etc. I guess I try to see the better side of a person even at their worst

I completely understand where you are coming from.  I actually live in Seattle, so I've been following this story since the day after it happened.","1306888035"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Basketball wasn't as popular then as it is today. There were probably tons of athletes that could have but didn't play basketball. When you have more players playing, of course the talent pool is gonna be greater.

Wilt was the most physically dominant player, and most players just couldn't match up. There weren't many or any other 7 footers he had to deal with. I honestly have no idea how he would fare against Shaq, David Robinson, Hakeem, Ewing, Dwight Howard, etc, today. But I'd bet everything I have against him averaging 50 ppg in a season.  

Also, Wilt took so many more shot attempts than Michael during his highest scoring seasons. During his 50.4 ppg season, he averaged 39.5 FG attempts and 17 Free Throw attempts per game. When you're getting that many shots, it's not surprising to average that many points. I think in the modern era, it's next to impossible to average that many shot attempts. 

Also, the rules were different then, and I'm sure there are some other factors I'm missing. For argument's sake though, let's say it wasn't a weaker era of Basketball. Wilt's PPG career average is still basically equal to Jordan's. Shouldn't someone who once averaged 50 ppg, have a career average much larger than Jordan's? Jordan's highest season was 37 ppg. 
This just shows that MJ was a better scorer for longer.

Don't always drop things just to give them attention, because I think that weirds some people out if you do it too much. Plus it's that whole playing hard to get thing. If you can get away with it, some kind of casual touch can be a good indicator that you're comfortable with someone, and you can judge how they react and maybe see if they like you too.

However, local cafe's each have their own feel and quality level, which has to be determined. Sometimes people just dont feel like taking the risk.


Also, while local cafes tend to serve better food (in my opinion), they also tend to be more expensive and quite a bit slower.

Edit to add: One benefit to locally owned places is that capitalism is REALLY working them. If their food sucks, they go out of business pretty quickly. So the ones that are around for a while tend to offer a lot of value. McDonalds, OTOH, is less susceptible to capitalism as they have a ""McEconomy"" which they can tap into.","1306888045"

This happens to women as well, women feel pressure to wear makeup and have overly expensive shoes etc because of other women.  Women also frequently put each other down due to intelligence more so then the average man (after a certain age of course, high school is brutal for smart, shy boys, its pretty brutal for just about everyone in fact)

No comics ever get posted about boys absolutely losing their cool over losing to a girl at a video game.  I've even dated guys I couldn't even play Madden with because their friends would give them so much shit over losing to a girl.

"ideasfortheadmins","t5_2qqhi","For this to work we would need a lot of people pretty dedicated to sifting through spam for quite a bit of time. The inherent problem with a modless subreddit is that there would have to be a voting system that would kill spam. 

The way I see it, this could go two ways. 

a)the amount of spam votes would be pretty low to strictly enforce spam limits...but if this was the case, a small group of trolls could probably mark everything as spam, keeping it from public view. 

b)conversely, the amount of spam votes would be too high, and spam would flood the new filters, to a point that even people dedicated to making reddit nicer would be to bogged down with post voting/deletion work that they (or at least I) would get fed up.

Also there would need to be a level level of across the board opinions about what is decent content and what is not.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It's not really the case; the problem is that for many kids education is not something that follows them *outside* of school.

If you look at individual cases, high-performing kids usually are immersed in a lifestyle conducive to learning. Their parents encourage questions, reading, educational activities...even taking an interest in their children's education makes a positive impact. It's like they are at school 24/7.

Kids who don't do well usually don't have those reinforcement mechanisms. Reading may be frowned upon, parents may not be apathetic (or working 2 jobs and not around enough to do much)...and they'll usually be surrounded by kids that have similar circumstances therefore reinforcing the cycle.

I think it would work better to take kids from under-performing districts and put them into top tier schools from an early age. If they are expected to reach high standards, they will. If you set the bar really low...then why are you surprised when they clear it every time and not a higher one?","1306888064"

The Language Instinct is a very good introduction to the science of language, or basically Chomskyan linguistics. Though when reading it, realise it's more a book about how the brain produces language, than about language itself.","1306888087"
"askseddit","t5_2s7xh","I went on a day2 with a girl in September last year. It went well, but her life situation was complicated. I was even more of a noob then than I am now so I fucked it up by too aggressively trying to get her out on a day 3, so she told me she didn't want to see me again. The attraction was strong though.

Three weeks ago I text her out of the blue. Went on a date 3 days later. Two weeks ago I fclosed her.

So yeah, no problem. In your case though, I'd steer clear of her since you had a oneitis for her. It's also easier to hookup with a girl you dumped, as compared to one who dumped you. Much easier I'd guess. Girls do the dumping far more often than they get dumped. Dumping them is a DHV, getting dumped a DLV.","1306888087"

Final:

NZ vs AUS - NZ Win

Right now, on paper this is how I reckon it would pan out. New Zealand have to win or else they will be disowned. However, it's a World Cup and anything can happen. 

Being an Irishman - I reckon Ireland have got the trick of peaking at the right time, with the Magners and Heineken in Ireland and more importantly in the key provinces they could upset Australia's youth with Irelands experienced heads and come first in the group. If they manage it - and on their day they can beat anyone, they *could* make it to the final. If Kidney uses the bench as a weapon and not as cover, we will do great. Remains to be seen what he will do.

You must also remember that upsets **will** happen. Samoa or Fiji could easily get out of the group. Wales just aren't that strong. Scotland could beat the Argies, they aren't as strong as they were 4 years ago. I think France are a disaster at the moment, Lièvremont couldn't coach an Under-8's team to victory, but there is obviously class in the team and they are always strong. No thanks to the coach, just to the players strength. I know they GS the 6Nations in 2010 but I don't think that was due to Lièvremont.

I think Australia are a great team, they will most likely do it. I would back them anyway except if they come up against NZ in the final. If NZ make it to the final I can only see them winning it.","1306888097"

After I got out of college, I had no ""real"" job for 6 months. I still got by giving drum lessons, writing for some shitty local newspaper, and babysitting my nephew.  In that time, I realized I should never have gone to college in the first place.  Now I'm working towards opening a small craft brewery, recording my band's first full-length, and writing some mildly interesting science-fiction sex fantasies.  I pay rent and student loans by working in a headshop, which is great cause I can still write, work on beer recipes, and compose music at that job.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think I know why.

 It's because they are overcompensating for something. Individually, they feel they can't measure up, so they cling to their ethnicity as a way of feeling better about themselves and feed their own ego. 

Other races certainly do this as well, however other races are quite a bit more discrete about it because it is socially taboo in multicultural countries. Jews don't have this inhibition (because everyone is afraid to criticize them) and it is biting them in the ass.

I rarely mention my ancestry, and I feel deep exasperation for people who are related to my ethnicity for mentioning it to others who most likely don't care about our race since we live in a multicultural country where cultures are blurred together.

The United States, Israel, and perhaps Britain are the only countries where Jews can express this childish behavior without being criticized because they just shoot back accusations of anti-semitism.   

Nationalism is the juvenile one-upsmanship game that is played to feed people's fragile egos much like some sports-fan hooligan roots for his/her football team. At least sport fans don't feel the need to create more countries and borders in this world.

In my experience the ones that have been most likely to mention their heritage have been people claiming to be Jewish, or would most likley be non-chalantly making references/jokes in regards to Judaism or Israel.

Im quite sick and tired of all the Israel, Jew, Holocaust -related obsession in the media. Other races have suffered more than they have yet they don't get nearly the level of attention, nor should they need to. It should simply be a matter of fact and history.... period.

"Iowa","t5_2qn1h","Maybe you should learn to understand where corn meal comes from? It's not just possible, it's how you get it.

Sweet corn - eaten as a vegetable

field corn - utilized as a cereal

(assuming we're talking kernels and can ignore silage and what not)

The article you posted has nothing to do with the shift to ethanol versus food availability as far as I can see.

e.g.

http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/18173/

&gt;According to the United States Department of Agriculture, this year the country is going to use 18 to 20 percent of its total corn crop for the production of ethanol, and by next year that will jump to 25 percent. And **that increase, says Marshall Martin, an agriculture economist at Purdue University, ""is the main driver behind the price increase for corn.""** 

&gt;The jump in corn prices is already affecting the cost of food. The **most notable example: in Mexico**, which gets much of its corn from the United States, the price of corn tortillas has doubled in the past year, according to press reports, setting off large protest marches in Mexico City. **It's almost certain that most of the rise in corn prices is due to the U.S. ethanol policy, says David Victor, director of the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University.** 


http://www.economist.com/node/10250420

&gt;In 2000 around 15m tonnes of America's maize crop was turned into ethanol; this year the quantity is likely to be around 85m tonnes. America is easily the world's largest maize exporter—and it now uses more of its maize crop for ethanol than it sells abroad.

&gt;**Ethanol is the dominant reason for this year's increase in grain prices.** It accounts for the rise in the price of maize because the federal government has in practice waded into the market to mop up about one-third of America's corn harvest. **A big expansion of the ethanol programme in 2005 explains why maize prices started rising in the first place.**

...
&gt;But overall, enormous numbers of the poor—both urban and landless labourers—are net buyers of food, not net sellers. **They have already been hard hit: witness the riots that took place in Mexico over tortilla prices earlier this year.** **According to IFPRI, the expansion of ethanol and other biofuels could reduce calorie intake by another 4-8% in Africa and 2-5% in Asia by 2020.** For some countries, such as Afghanistan and Nigeria, which are only just above subsistence levels, such a fall in living standards could be catastrophic.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","There is a movie titled I-Robot. It's basically where humans create robots, and the robots have 3 laws. 

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.


In the movie the robots all basically enslave the humans because humans are a threat to themselves and blah blah, one robot has free will and doesn't follow the laws, and the story moves on. That one robot saves the day.

In the end he's all like, what is the purpose of life? That you define your own purpose.. etc. etc. 

The purpose of life in Islam in a nutshell is to worship God, live a good and full life, and procreate to advance the species. As long as you fulfill the rights of God, and the rights of the creation (people, animals, the environmental...etc.) then you can do whatever you want in life. If you want to be an artist you can do that, if you want to stop wars and feed the homeless, you can do that too. If you want to do nothing and make money, you can also do that.  As long as you don't void the rights of God or the creation, which is talked about in the Islamic doctrine.

I love that you're asking the question! you should look at /r/philosophy sometime maybe, I am quite a fan of philosophy in general and I find myself pondering questions like this often.  However you use the term moral, and that's probably not what you want, you probably mean is it *ethical*.  Something is moral if your moral code says it is okay, so the question of if something is moral or not just requires you to know your moral code and apply it.  Ethics on the other hand is much more broad! Morality is a form of ethics, but ethics typically always has more then one answer or way of looking at things.  With morality it is just; you look it up on your moral code, and either it is moral or it isn't.

Now then.  Ethics.  This situtation is ethical in some frameworks and not ethical in others.  There are some systems that say that all the matters is how many people benefit and how may people are hurt, and if more people benefit then are hurt, the action is ethical.  This is called utilitarianism and under it this action could quite possibly be ethical.  Another system is called ontological, and in that framework an action is ethical if it follows a rule most of us agree on (that is over simplifying it..!).  Under that system this action is probably unethical, but an ontological ethics follower would argue it is never right to ""screw people over"" regardless of the consequences.

There are a lot of systems so I could really go on and on without reaching a stopping point, so I""m just going to artificially create one here.

To make a long story short, I ran a command that ended abnormally without throwing an error. That command wiped out the internal routing table and since they'd already switched half the network over too it, everything went down. I was finishing up, and not noticing anything wrong, I headed home.

A few hours later I got a panicked call saying that everything was down and nobody knows why. I drove in, checked the switch and noticed the routing table was empty. Called operations and had them restore the data from tape.

Come Monday, my boss had been chewed out by the client and wanted to chew me out. I called the client (in their presence) and apologized for the outage, I once again suggested a development switch (in as nice of a way as possible). I took full responsibility for the problem and told them I'd done everything I could as quickly as possible to restore service as soon as I'd been notified. The client, while still pissed, accepted my apology and decided a development switch was a good idea (got one 2 weeks later).

TL;DR Man up, admit you fucked up to your boss and or clients, and most importantly have a good plan of how to get back on track.","1306888140"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","His response -- if I recall correctly -- is just that humans *can* act otherwise, but animals *cannot*. Since you can't be obligated to do something which you are not able to do (*ought implies can*), animals don't have moral obligations. But people can (and some do) do otherwise (i.e. they do not kill or inflict pain on animals, intentionally at least through food), it is clear that people can do otherwise which makes the obligation bind.

You can think of like children for instance (or mentally retarded people for that matter). We don't think they are culpable for what they do because we don't see them as sufficiently able to police and guide their own behavior. They don't really have moral obligations then, just like animals don't.","1306888141"

For example, step fathers have a much higher abuse rate than biological fathers.  This makes quite a bit of sense in terms of evolutionary thinking.  However, we can recognize, and then mitigate this behavior through cognition.

Heck, we are even capable of saying ""I don't care if I pass my genes on.""  I still have the urge to fuck, but I put a condom on.  I recognize that I have biological urges, but I'm able to surpass them.

"education","t5_2qhlm","Regarding number 2 and your experience, it is likely that whatever criteria are applied, talented teachers will be let go.  The question is whether the current situation (of using seniority) is a significantly impacting teacher quality and whether the proposals of these billionaires has any likelihood of improving things.  As Bruce Baker [has said](http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/thinking-through-cost-benefit-analysis-and-layoff-policies/), ""The tradeoff being made in this case is a tradeoff  NOT between “keeping quality teachers” versus “keeping old, dead wood” ..., but rather the tradeoff between laying off teachers on the unfortunately crude basis of seniority only, versus laying off teachers on a marginally-better-than-random, roll-of-the-dice basis.  I would argue the latter may actually be more problematic for the future quality of the teaching workforce!  Yes, pundits seem to think that destabilizing the teaching workforce can only make it better. How could it possibly get worse, they argue? Substantially increasing the uncertainty of career earnings for teachers can certainly make it worse.""  

Regardless of what our layoff policies are, I would argue that debate over them amounts to re-arranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.  That is, any difference in these policies is dwarfed by the negative impact of the drastic budget cuts facing districts across the country.  I don't think it's an accident that this is how the ed policy discussion is being framed.  It's a classic Shock Doctrine approach of manufacturing a crisis to force concessions from working people.

1. It is claimed that Paul opposes abortion and would attempt to ban it.

2. A person responds that Paul would not ban abortion because it would be unconstitutional and Paul believes the federal government has no right to do so.

3. Evidence is provided that Paul has tried to ban certain types of abortion and would like to change the definition of life.

4. All of a sudden it is ok that Paul would ban it because he believes it is life, when originally the whole fucking reason the debate started was because someone wanted to insist he wouldn't ban abortion.  Also, Paul believes life starts at conception. If it is ok for him to vote the way he did because, as you claim, he believes partial-birth abortion is done to a being that is a human life, then by that same logic Paul, who believes life starts at conception, would also be able to vote/sign law that bans abortion completely.

Answer:
Blue Waffles

When someone refers to a ""Blue Waffle,"" they're not referring to your typical blueberry breakfast-food. 

A ""waffle"" is a slang term for ""vagina."" And a ""Blue Waffle"" is a slang term for a severe vaginal infection. 

It's basically a slang term for an extremely nasty or severe vaginal infection/STD on the vagina. The infection could cause lesions on the outside of the vagina, as well as bruising, which causes it to look blue in color.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not sure if I saved his life or not, but I did help someone.

I was on my way home from work at about 11pm, so the freeways were pretty empty. I have about a 15 mile drive from work to home, and I was on the phone with my GF. I see something blocking the on ramp thing up ahead of me, and slow down to make sure something isnt going to jump out in front of me.

As I get closer I see that its a single car accident. The guy had taken the ramp to fast or something and hit a guard rail. I stop about 1/4 mile after the accident, hop out of the car and run to the accident. I hang up the phone with my GF as soon as I get to the accident.

As I got closer I saw that the guy hit the rail so hard that the left side wheels were ripped off the car, and all the windows were shattered. As I approach the car, the guy gets out of the passenger side and asks me to help him push his car back onto the road. Not going to happen, I tell him and he begins to insist that I help him push the car. I offer to let him use my phone to call a family member, and a tow truck. He refuses and starts to rub his head. As he brought his hand off his head I saw blood on his hand. I immediately called the police. I know I should have called them earlier, but I wanted to make sure the guy was OK before I called. I dont know why, but I did.

As soon as the phone is dialing, he tells me not to call the police, that he is fine, and he doesnt want to cause any trouble with the police. At this point I am ignoring what he is saying. I thought he was woozy, and not thinking clearly and thats why he was asking me to help push his car. I offer to let him sit in my warm car, while the police arrive (October in Minnesota), he refused and began to walk away from the accident.

Now I am explaining the situation to dispatch, and trying to keep this guy from running. He runs across 3 lanes of freeway, gets to the median and screams at me ""Hey! It wasnt me, it was my cousin! Tell them that!"", then takes off across the other 3 lanes of freeway. He turns around again and yells ""Hey, my cousin was driving, remember!"". I see a state trooper arriving as I yell back at the guy ""I cant hear you, youre too far away. Come back!"", at which point he runs across all 6 lanes of freeway and the median right as the trooper arrives. All of this happened while I was on the phone to dispatch, after the officer stopped I told dispatch that the officer was there and she said with a slight chuckle ""Good job. Thank you for calling in.""

The trooper took the guy, and told me to get in my car and reverse it back to the accident. Two ambulances, two fire trucks, three state troopers, two city police, and what I can best describe as a SWAT truck showed up. The police took my statement, asking about the guys cousin and if I smelled the alcohol on him.

**TL;DR:** Stopped a bleeding drunk driver from running from an accident.","1306888170"

I'm going to get a little rude here, and do forgive me, but I've had seven hours of sleep since I think Sunday (today's Tuesday, isn't it?), and TIL that it might be possible to get [DTs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_tremens) from lack of sleep. (my sleep problems have been going on for almost 10 years). 

FUCKING TELL HIM when something's the matter. Stand-up comedians have made CAREERS out of telling jokes about their wives/GFs just sitting and sighing when something's wrong. 

The joke usually goes along the lines of 

W/GF: -heavy sigh-
-
Guy: Honey, what's wrong?
-
W/GF: Oh, *nothing*

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Umm hate to break it to you, but according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, it is also a noun in addition to an adjective, and the noun definition implies a noncommittal to a belief in god(s).

ag·nos·tic - noun \ag-ˈnäs-tik, əg-\

1: a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable; broadly : one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god 


http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic


So according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, saying ""I'm agnostic"" does in fact mean something, it means I'm ""one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god.""  You are incorrect in saying this means nothing.  Next time you should look up a word in the dictionary before acting like you are an expert.","1306888197"

China and the North have a strained relationship.

It's like feeding a wild dog that you have in the ally next to your house, because even though it would be better to get rid of it, you're better off feeding the dog than letting it go after the neighborhood kids. Mostly because the neighborhood kids have a big friend (the U.S.) that will come over and annoy the shit out of you if let the dog do what it wants.

"Assistance","t5_2s25d","Wow,

My heart goes out to you on this one, and I wish there was more that someone, anyone could do to help.

It's literally, to me anyway, the most noble thing in the world, to *feel* for another being, be that an animal, or a  human. I've been on the receiving end of r/assistance's help, to get me back on my feet. I've seen some wonderful people do some wonderful things for myself and for others here, so I DO now know for certain, that there really is love and compassion in this world, and not just for one's  immediate friends and family.

As for  how to make your cat feel better (this is killing me, I have two cats myself, and they are very near to my heart), I can't offer much advice. What I WOULD say, is stay away from any of the folk remedies that you're bound to run into. I've seen sprays that you put into animal's water that claims to loosen their joints and make them feel better.

A lot of those are homeopathic remedies, and I know I might get flamed for this, but I'm firmly against the marketing of those sorts of medicines for any use. I've always felt that any effect received by someone from them has to be chalked up to a placebo effect, if anything.

Now, a placebo effect might work if it were a human taking such a remedy, but since you can't relay to your cat that he'll feel better after you spray his water with something, I don't think placebo would work for the poor little guy.

I'd say that you're doing just about all you can. Prednasone is a steroid and will help strengthen the muscles in his body. This will relieve a lot of the pressure off of his skeletal system that is weak in those parts. Prednasone, because it's a steroid, takes time to work. In the immediate-sense, it will reduce swelling, which might be giving poor Leo a little bit of relief.

Your love for your cat is probably the best medicine aside from what your vet is doing for him. I know there IS such a thing as ""kitty vicodin,"" but I would think that if your vet thought he was in that much pain, he might've already given it to you to give to him. It could be though, that since this will be a chronic condition, they don't want to give your cat narcotics and get him used to having that, since the only way to continue the pain relief would be to continue the narcotics.

I'm so sorry for your cat, but I want you to know that your Leo knows how much you love him! Your care, the things you've tried to do for him, taking him to the vet, and... well, he probably doesn't know that you made a reddit post for  him - but he certainly knows he's loved and that he's in good hands!

Best of luck to you and your kitty. I hope the best for both of you!","1306888224"

I tried my best not to make you think it is from the Saudi males but I guess I didn't express it enough. Please remember that we are talking about a general condition where male individuals can be harmful.

We cannot say that it is as safe for a woman to drive alone in a none-urban place as it is for a man. We'd be fooling ourselves if we think otherwise. Women are defenseless and are easy to prey on. The prohibition is aiming to close all doors which could lead to rape/theft on females. But of course, it also does close some good doors as well. If you know what I mean.","1306888272"

I think its so easy to protest, and become upset, but that takes the focus away from being a Christ-like example, in some instances.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think we're agreeing on some points that may need to be clarified. The big cartels will run shit, yes. They will destroy the other smaller ones, I agree. I understand the comparison between American mafia back around prohibition and the cartels in that they run all over the police and authorities. Like you said though, the groups who get forced out of the drug trade will end up doing petty crime and more run of the mill stuff. This would, like I said, result in a lot more shit going wrong for more people with more victims/casualties as the same amount of people try to grab pieces of a smaller pie. The people who displaced won't all be killed by the big cartels, and many of them will still be criminals. If it's not drugs, its going to be something else. The difference between the Mafia and the cartels is that the people in the Mafia, if displaced, had other options. Many of the people who are into the Mexican crime scene do not have other options, and will do what it takes for them to survive/thrive. It's a little different. I do see your points though.

Maybe you know him? (Douchebag #1's name)"" while we were hanging out together drinking coffee. I burst into tears and ran to the restroom, and my friends explained to him that Douchebag was my boyfriend, and he (unwittingly; I did NOT know this other dude prior to that night) exposed my BF's cheating.

Second - walked in on him pulling up his pants with the slut in the bed naked. We had been together for 13 years, and he slept with her in the house WE bought together, that I put the entire down payment on. He would never own up to it, except to say that he was no longer attracted to me.

The average conversation is normally around 55 dB SPL.

* 
The Audio Engineering Society recommends not exceeding 85 dB SPL when in the studio for extended periods of time without frequent breaks or hearing protection.

* 
The threshold of physical pain in humans is approximately 150 dB SPL, varying from person to person.
* 
The highest (theoretically) possible dB SPL reading in Earth's atmosphere is 212 dB SPL. This is only possible with nuclear bombs.


Keeping in mind that the decibel scale is logarithmic (6 decibel increase = approx. twice the pascal force of the sound wave)...  **To do that sort of damage to the human body in that amount of time (Internal/Bleeding, vomiting, hearing failure) would require sustained exposure to no less than 175 dB SPL, or the approximate equivalent of a stun grenade's peak transient.** This would make the car literally shake itself to pieces and shatter the windows, giving the delinquents an easy escape.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I had been planning to launch a technology site for a little over a month before I solicited interest from others. At that time, I had no serious ideas about a name. In my view, a name comes last. I had given it zero thought.

Once it was time to actually put a name on it, I had nothing but corny ideas. All of the other suggestions were corny, too, but there was something about “Ars Technica” that had a beautiful ring to it even if it was hopelessly of secure and doomed to be misrecognized as A R S Technica. For me personally, it was the fusion of two of my passions at the time that sold it: Latin and Greek (techne is a Greek word, and it was brought into Latin). On a practical level, it was the only name we had that wasn't beyond ridiculous.

Jon Stokes gets credit for suggesting it. I hate to think of what we might have been stuck with were it not for Jon's suggestion!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","No. It is not basic fact.  You are making statements about Danish law, a subject about which you know absolutely nothing. You are then proceeding to argue about it with someone who is (allegedly) a Danish citizen.

You know nothing about Danish law. Stop arguing with a Danish citizen (regardless of whether that Danish citizen is actually correct).

Second, you are still incorrect. People have been storing food for thousands of years.  How do you think our ancestors ate during the winter? They harvested crops and stored them in dry locations (or one of many other ways to preserve them) to be slowly eaten throughout the winter. This is very basic.  On top of the fact that pesticides and genetic modifications have very little to do with the lifespan of a plant after it has been harvested.  The genetic modifications are designed to make the vegetables larger (an idea I am not opposed to; that's what domestication has always been about), the pesticides are designed to keep bugs from eating them *while they're growing*. The most important factor for keeping the vegetables safe for market is keeping them in a dry, closed environment away from bugs. Scientists are currently working on methods to prevent early deterioration of plants after they have been harvested, but this level of biotechnology is not in common use.

Also, forgiveness of debt is taxable income, so that makes it hard for the mortgage holder.  I don't know, maybe you could structure the redo as a home sale, so you wouldn't get whacked on the forgiveness.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt; The range of “normalcy” grows narrower every decade as the new Diagnostic Manual for psychiatrists is released. With the inception of the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders) back in 1952, there were only 106 mental disorders invented. Now, with the DSM-IV, there are over 300 mental disorders

Um, the second and third sentences don't really provide evidence for the first, though the author seems to believe they do. New disorders are added not so much because more things are considered abnormal, but because old diagnoses are considered vague or inaccurate and get split off into separate, more detailed ones. Indeed, behaviour that was considered ""abnormal"" when the first DSM was released in '52 is not in the DSM-IV because it's considered normal now.

Which isn't to say that new behaviour patterns *haven't* been added, but that a simplistic count of the number of separate labels tells you nothing about ""The range of “normalcy”"" and whether it's growing narrower or not. 

Also, this is [a way more interesting article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/magazine/10psyche-t.html) discussing how mental illness is shaped by culture, and therefore varies around the globe.

Sure, if enough people vote my third-party, that party will get a statistically significant 1% of popular vote, no electoral votes, and the media will talk about it for three days. After that, it will be forgotten, and people will be running the country that I had no hand in electing.""

This assumes A) that the media will change based on the vote count and that it will somehow not be beholden to corporate or political interests  B) that only through the media can your voice be heard, the same media that lies and ignores you already unless you have a view they consider relevant  C) that anyone having a hand in electing a party has a say in the running of the government.

You don't have a voice in the RNC and DNC and that's why you shouldn't vote for them.

""At least if the opposing party gets a close second, that might be relevant inasmuch as it could moderate the elected person a bit, as he is clearly 'on thin ice.' (not that that theory always works)""

When has this EVER worked?

""your conscience doesn't get to vote in congress. Only the winner does.""

Yes and that winner can be anybody.  Sonny Bono was a Senator.  Al Franken IS a Senator.  I don't think looking at them ten years prior to their election you would've considered them political pay dirt.

Bernie Sanders is a Socialist and he's in Congress right now.

You can't have your argument both ways.  If your vote matters, then giving it to the third party matters.  If your vote doesn't matter, then at least you're voting with your conscience.","1306888384"

We had all just finished finals and were going to have a bonfire with our textbooks to celebrate, so we hopped the gate to the old sand quarry across from the school and had our small (maybe 2 foot wide) bonfire in the middle of the road.  Almost zero risk of fire spreading.

Cops show up, we see them driving down the long road to the quarry and everyone just bolts...  I have no idea why, there wasnt even anything illegal going on.  

I run about 15 feet into the knee high grass, and my glasses come flying off my face in the pitch dark.  I know I wont make it back to the dorm without them, so I stop dead and look around real quick, but cant find them.  

By that point, the cop is to the campfire, maybe 15 feet from me, and looking around.  Im just right there crouched in the weeds trying to feel around silently for my glasses.  He shines his light right over me a couple times, and I know im caught.   But for some reason he never sees me, puts out the fire with an extinguisher, and takes some girls flip flops that were there...

If a loved one became a deranged serial killer and murdered all your friends, you'd hate them because they were a deranged serial killer, but you'd still love the person they used to be, and (assuming they couldn't be cured), you'd likely say, ""Sometimes, I wish you had died instead of becoming a serial killer.""

**EDIT:** Oh, I think the contention is that he should have dropped the 'sometimes', but I mean, being reminded of who she used to be, I don't think it'd be easy for him to say he'd want her gone entirely (and it turned out he was right in feeling that hesitation to have wanted her totally eradicated).","1306888402"

His followers were ready to fight by his side, but being the boss that he his, Musashi denied their help, saying that his battles were his to fight alone.  Anyway, Musashi believed just as much in mental battles as he did in the physical ones, and a favorite tactic of his was to show up late to duals.  This would anger his opponent, causing them to lose focus and would make them not fight as well.  However, for this one battle, Musashi decided he would outsmart his opponents in another way.  The two men showed up with an army of 100 soldiers, and they knew Musashi's ways.  They showed up early and were anticipating Musashi being late, so they told all their soldiers to take it easy and relax for a while.  All of the sudden, Musashi sprang from a nearby tree and killed all 100 men.  Legend has it that he left with only a rip in his clothing from an arrow.  Boss status.

 Push ups could do a bit I suppose but you'll peak pretty quickly. It's so much easier to gain muscle doing weighted workouts like benching. Many people superset (means doing one exercise right after another) weighted bench with pushups though.","1306888419"
"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I agree with all of the above!  I certainly never said no woman ever changes her mind in EITHER direction.  I'm sure there are many examples of woman who choose one way and then regret their decision.  In fact, I'm pretty sure there are examples all over the place of woman AND men who make choices in life and come to regret the things they did or didn't do once it's too late.

I was never arguing that, nor am I saying that I don't think ANYONE should have children.  That would be ridiculous.  I also don't think I'm better than people who decide to- I just think I'm focusing that energy elsewhere.  

I'm not exactly sure where in my comment I led you to believe I thought either of these things, so I'm just going to quote myself from elsewhere in the thread:

&gt;I fully support other people's decisions to have children, but when I find them judging my own decision I can't help wondering how well they'd take it if I started ""oh that's too bad"", or ""I'm sorry"" when they tell me they have kids.

On top of that I removed all of the vents and cleaned with one of those bristly long wire things all the way down them. I used some industrial cleaning solution that smelled like ""clean"" (couldn't place the smell past that) that I got from wal mart for this step.
The most important thing after that is to replace your cabin air filter. Remove it and get a nice quality one. This makes sure the smell doesn't come back.
Long story short about 350 dollars down and I had a car that looked and smelled brand new. It was SPOTLESS from the detailing, smelled like nothing from the cleaning, and the smell did not come back.

Most educated folks probably think evolution was just god's mechanism of creation or something like that.
So as of now, I compromise. If they ask me to go to church with them, I go and think about stuff in general while others pray. Oh, and I do kinda like sermons. They either tend to be pearls of wisdom or hilariously funny(from my pov). So win-win :D","1306888450"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Both my wife and I have been in and out of college, we are not unfamiliar with the grant/loan/scholarship thing.  I think the risk of elitism is worth encouraging competition among students, and ensuring the cream of the crop get an unburdened chance to take things as far as they possibly can.  Not only do they benefit, but society does as well.   

Offering preferential treatment to minorities just because they are minorities is a load of horseshit.  Under Etherreal Rule, this would not be allowed.  The same applies to preferential treatment for athletes.  

The problem with the current system is, everyone is eager to mortgage their future financial status with easy loans in order to get the success that the all important college degree promises.  Unfortunately, this has some serious side effects:

* Lowering the initial barrier to entry has resulted in enhanced cost later, both in interest payments and inflating education costs due to pure demand.  

* Lowering the initial barrier to entry has devalued college education on the whole.  Too many low paying jobs now require a 4 year degree when a good training program should be sufficient.  

*The influx of students has created a glut of diploma mills and harmed the overall quality of education.  

The Big Liberal Promise of cheap college for everyone sounds good on the surface, but on the whole, is a net loss for the middle class.  Instead of easy money to any student who wants to attend, we should focus on spending that money in a more effective manner.  I believe my proposal addresses that.

is that a bad thing?  I am not afraid of the boogey man word ""communism""

and I believe that all economic system have their pros and cons and that a mix mash between all systems is the best approach so far.

&gt;Shouldn't one give his kids something nice if he has a lot of money? Why can't a superior education be one of those things?

here is my problem with giving the rich a superior education than
the poor.

it creates an almost unbreakable cycle of the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer.

I am strongly against any such system that will exacerbate that cycle.

it is in much greater advantage for humanity and society as a whole for **everyone** to have access to the best possible education. (except for the ultra-wealthy who which to consolidate and keep their wealth and power)

and when you call me a communist I say that it is the american dream for a poor man to bring himself up through class ranks and make himself a great success.

when private education is far superior to public education it greatly impedes that goal.

I also have a big problem with the wealthy passing down their wealth to their offspring and believe this amount should be greatly limited.

money = power in every essence of the definition.

so when the wealthy hand down their wealth they hand down their power to their children and so on and so forth.

the founders of america knew this was a horrible thing which is why they were so resistant to monarchy.  the handing down of un-earned power creates tyranny.

this is why america has turned into the oligarchy it is today.  where such a huge amount of the overall wealth of the nation is in the hands of a few families.

&gt;What about the ability to go overseas every summer to become a well-rounded person?

this is far different than an education system.  learning done in ones own private time should not be limited or governed.  however when it comes to ""schooling and education"" as we know it.  I believe the best course of action for society is for everyone to have access to the best education possible.","1306888496"

inventory 1-4 = d-pad

be wary of overly compressing signals, the punch and dynamics helps tracks cut through the mix. try motown/new york compression if you need to increase presence but don't want to lose the punch (basically, mix a compressed signal with the uncompressed to get the best of both worlds, also consider EQing both signals separately) ","1306888519"

Plus, as I'm not a 'cab' guy, Napa just doesn't do it for me. Also, the wine tends to be pricy. In Oakville is the Oakville Grocery; it's a **must** for sandwiches for the road.

But take my advice; head up to Healdsburg and take Westside Road, then River Road out to Jenner (the coast). Swing by William Selyem (my favorite California Pinot Noir producer), and see if they have a tasting room (I'm in *the* industry, so I don't always know who is open to the public.) It's not the cheapest wine around (probably about $50, but if you like Pinot, I think it'll be well worth it), but you'll pay about what you'd pay for a mediocre Cab in Napa and get something much better.

Surroundings-wise, you won't do better than this area. The drive between Healdsburg and Forrestville will knock your socks off, especially this time of year.

Started by picking them up at thrift stores, and since I just bought a ebook reader, I downloaded a bunch of them for free, since they're all out of copyright.  You can look on the site for your particular reader, [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/?node=2245146011), for example, has a bunch of free classics listed for you.  Just pick some that you've heard of, or that look interesting.  I've been really enjoying Frankenstein and Dracula lately, for example.  

In terms of more contemporary stuff, I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman.  I also really liked Little Brother by Cory Doctorow, and a lot of his stuff is available online for free, because he's awesome like that.  I haven't actually read anything of Doctorow's, other than Little Brother, but I have several on my reading list.  Harry Potter and the Hunger Games trilogy were also very good... though Hunger Games tended to drop off a bit, in my opinion.  

Hope this gives you suggestions!  Books are generally found by word of mouth, so find other people who like reading and find out what they like.   Enjoy reading and good luck finding stuff!","1306888533"

When I reached new chunks, sky islands were generated rather than normal land. This is the result. If you die, head to around x= -200, z= -100. I left Steve in a disorienting situation for you to negotiate.

If you explore this save, no new sky world chunks will be generated besides what's already there. I haven't crossed the wide chasm yet, but there will be solid land on the other side if I ever manage to do so.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;we don't need this comment every single time someone brings up free speech.

Then stop bringing up free speech in inappropriate contexts. ""Free speech"" has specific, powerful meanings, and by using the term incorrectly you're misappropriating the force of those meanings. Free speech as you're defining it is a nebulous, undefined social ideal, and the way it's being used here is, frankly, hypocritical. If free speech as you define it really was the issue here, then people wouldn't be so quick to condemn the father. But for the fact that we're commenting in a semi-anonymous forum rather than directly to the man's face, we're doing *exactly what he did* - trying to get someone to stop saying/doing something because we don't like what he's saying/doing.

It's all well and good to say ""the right to express their ideas without someone actively pursuing a method to ban or control what someone else says,"" but from whose perspective? The father has as much a right to make his displeasure known as the store has to display its advertisements.

In fact, you're exaggerating the situation. By your own definition, this isn't an affront on ""free speech,"" because the man didn't try to ban or control what someone else said - *he approached an employee and asked them a question, and they told him no*. If you don't think that's an exercise of free speech on both parties' parts, you have some serious rethinking to do.","1306888545"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Met a beautiful girl, went back to her apartment where she tells me she's a go go dancer and points to a pole in her living room. We're drinking, laughing, having a grand old time. I'm in a good mood since, well, if you're a straight male who doesn't get that many girls, let alone one this hot, you'd be excited too. I'm there for about an hour when a knock on the door happens. It's her ex and he claims to have left something there.

No biggie, he'll be in and out of her apartment and then I'll be in and out of her. Wrong. Ex ends up staying, as do I, because I'm stubborn.

So, now the ex joins the festivities. We're all drinking and NOW she gets on the pole, in loose fitting booty shorts with no underwear on and proceeds to show us more than just her moves.  He was cool and all, but each of us wanted the other to leave for the whole time.  I wish I could give you all a better ending, but I took the hint and left them alone after that.

The next day they were back together and have been since, which is two years. 

TL;DR: Hung out with a super hot go go dancer, ex showed up just in time to fuck me over, neither of us will leave, I eventually cave and go home forever alone.","1306888552"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In college a friend and I were wrapping up a fruitful night of tagging billboards with political slogans.  One was against the bank bailouts, which had just happened, and it ended up on the local news. 

For some reason, near home, we saw a billboard for some department store with a huge face of some model on it and decided to paint some facial hair onto it. Climbed all the way up and as we're finishing we see two cop cars pull into the adjacent alley.  Crap.

We both rush down off the billboard, jumping onto the roof of a dry-cleaners below, then scurrying over to its yard where we might have a shot at jumping the fence before being caught.  But we're too slow.  Two cops are already on the other side of the fence, shining their flashlights at us and telling us to stop trying to hide. My friend and I run around a bit, unsuccessfully trying to find another way out of the yard, and getting separated.  Finally, I come out and start to climb the fence with the cops on the other side.  I pause at the top, gauging whether I leap over him and dash away, but decide it's too risky.  The cop cuffs me for a few minutes, takes my ID info down, and says I'll be arrested at home in a few days.  

The other cop finally jumps the fence and searches around for my friend.  Looks everywhere with his flashlight, including under the dry cleaners' two vans in the yard, doesn't find him and gives up.  Cops take off.

Around an hour that night, I call my friend.  He seems out of breath and whispers, ""Are they gone?""  ""Uh yeah I think so.  Where are you?""  ""I'm under the van.""  ""Under the van?  But I knew he would look under there, and he did!""  ""I know!  But I'm like, up in the van.  He didn't see anything.""

Turns out he'd held himself so far up against the chassis of the van, spread-eagle like a ninja on a ceiling, that when the cop looked down there he didn't see anything.  We met up later and he was grinning ear-to-ear.  Pretty sure he's out sailing up the East Coast right now.

TL;DR My friend successfully hid himself in the chassis of a van, ninja-like, from the cops.","1306888553"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","One thing that riles me is the commonly expressed stereotype that Android users just ""don't buy apps"" as if there's some kind of psychological trait shared by all Android users.   This might have been arguable back when Android had 8% of the market, mostly geeks and early adopters (only a year or so ago) but it is outright impossible for it to be true when you have 35% of the market (and growing).   There is no way to have that market share and not be primarily mainstream consumers who buy things no more or less than anyone else.  If there are reasons they aren't buying then it is about the platform, the technology, the market, etc, all things that are rapidly evolving and changing.

I think the Android market has incredible potential precisely because it hasn't been  tapped yet.   This is why Amazon is chasing it - they can see this mass of consumers waiting to buy stuff if only someone not entirely incompetent at marketing and consumer savvy offers it to them.","1306888578"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Actually, it's a thermistor.

WIKIPASTE:

&gt; PTC thermistors are used as timers in the degaussing coil circuit of most CRT displays and televisions. When the display unit is initially switched on, current flows through the thermistor and degaussing coil. The coil and thermistor are intentionally sized so that the current flow will heat the thermistor to the point that the degaussing coil shuts off in under a second. For effective degaussing, it is necessary that the magnitude of the alternating magnetic field produced by the degaussing coil decreases smoothly and continuously, rather than sharply switching off or decreasing in steps; the PTC thermistor accomplishes this naturally as it heats up. A degaussing circuit using a PTC thermistor is simple, reliable (for its simplicity), and inexpensive.

So, if you do it again straight away, the thermistor is still hot and won't pass as much current.

Edit: To degauss the monitor you need to use a big oscillating field. So you have a sine wave, and using a thermistor causes the amplitude to decrease over time, like [this](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot%5BSin%5Bx%5D%2Fx%2C+{x%2C+0%2C+40}%5D).","1306888594"

It was little more than a tutorial combined with jokes at MW2's expense; ""pussy ass heartbeat monitors"" and ""snowmobiles are for sissy's"". They really tried to match COD with over the top bullshit when it came to the ending too and frankly that has no place in a battlefield game. Thank god the multiplayer was superb.

COD is what it is, love it or hate it; cheesy action, scripted stories, fast paced multiplayer etc. Battlefield should stick to its own formula and if BF3 has a great single player, well awesome.

It was way past midnight during the monsoon, we were drunk and had just been hit in the head by MPs and tossed outside in the pouring rain in the back alley. My wingman was puking  like crazy, cheap rotgut we had been drinking all night, all week, I mean. Anyway, these nuns were coming up he road trying to get in out of the rain... I stood up and asked the Mother Superior if she would like to bring her nuns into our place, a cheap but leak-less apartment about 10 of us rented by the month. She didn't understand English very well but I motioned that they were welcome and she obliged. Once inside the nuns, about 6 of them, began taking off their overcoat like rainwear. Underneath each was the usual black and white outfit commonly seen anywhere nus hang out. Anyway, after warming up in the apartment, I began talking to the Mother and learned she had been in Vietnam about 6 years and had originally come from South Africa. We talked for what seemed like hours until my best ever wingman walked over and told her ""You know he wants to fuck you, right?"" He laughed at the funny joke he had played on me thinking he had destroyed any chance I might have with Mother. She frowned and shook her head but looked up at me and whispered, we would have to go somewhere else first"" I immediately sobered up  and asked her if she wanted to take a walk since the rain has stopped pouring down. We went outside, back to the alley and for 45 minutes this nun blew me, fucked me frontways, sideways, left, right and made me even get on bottom while she rode me like she hadn't ridden in years. We finished, she gathered up her crew and left without any other words. The morning light came and when my wingman finally got his ass out of bed, he walked in and said ""Sorry I fucked you up last night. I was drink and didn't know what I was doing"" I said, that's ok, man. I understand. I never told him what a great wingman he really was. Good times.. good times...  ","1306888610"

We'd occasionally see a lone pelican flying along the shore when before there would be a dozen of them flying in formation. Same with the seagulls, sandpipers, and dragonflies.

"HeroesofNewerth","t5_2r497","here's another thing you could do, just an idea:

create a php script which loads each of all of the xml responses, and caches the results, and converts them to json. this is easy because theres a toJSON method in php. it'll also be easy to deserialize the php objects in the api calls.

create a jsonp api for the hon API. so someone could go to yoursite.com/heroes?callback=myCallbackFunction
this will return the json of the heroes, and then call myCallbackFunction and pass the data as parameter. this way people can embed script tags on their site to get the json data, without any cross domain issues.

so on my site i could just do:

&lt;script src='yoursite.com/heroes?callback=myCallbackFunction'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function myCallbackFunction(herodata)
{
    myApp.heroes = herodata;

Other, more recent bands include Kylesa, Baroness, Valient Thorr, Clutch, and Red Fang. A lot of bands, like Mastodon, are from Atlanta and/or part of Relapse Records.

That being said, I also don't think there's anything wrong with you wanting a relationship and deciding to choose other dating options if he's still not ready to take the plunge. 

I akin this to how I handle relationships. I want to make sure that I won't lose interest 6 months down the road. While it's a scummy thing to do, it has happened and I won't stay in a relationship I'm not feeling right about. I want to make sure we're both compatible and I fulfill her needs as well as she fills mine. I don't think there's anything wrong with that either. Too many relationships start in a whirlwind and end just as abruptly.

Some libraries still do this (e.g. syntax highlighters), but it's very very naughty. It conflicts with the regular use of classes and can cause some issues if there is any overlap with the classes you use in your stylesheets.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","IMO, this whole discussion shows why Barca are the by far the best team in the world and possibly the greatest ever, there is just seemingly no way to stop them. The way they play football is seemingly impossible to counter, press them high up the pitch &amp; they simply pass triangles through your spaced out players &amp; split your defence with a seemingly impossible through ball. Defend deep &amp; they'll just dribble &amp; one-two their way through apparently impregnable walls of players. Not to mention that even if you work out a way to nullify their strategy, they have so many individually talented players (read: every single one of them is technically brilliant) that you have to rely on most of the team having an off day to avoid being beaten by a moment of magic. When they play well, they are seemingly unstoppable.

FWIW, my plan for beating Barca: Barca win by playing simple football incredibly well, to stop them you only need a simple tactic but you need to implement it perfectly. Barca mainly play through a ridiculous amount of short, simple passes (believe it or not), that through technically brilliant one-touch football &amp; the incredible vision of their players allows them to pass through defences as if they weren't there.

To put it simply, to outclass Barca, you need to constantly hassle them &amp; cut down their passing options, thus killing their play style. Make them pass backwards, outmuscle them, prevent them from building up any sort of rhythm, look at the first 10 minutes of the final when Barca were nervous &amp; kept on losing the ball. Most importantly, their midfield quartet (Biscuits, Xavi, Iniesta &amp; Messi) are the heart of the team &amp; by marking &amp; closing down all of them you will greatly reduce their effectiveness.

What part of your business produces the most green benefit?  Is it the few pounds of carbon you aren't adding with gas mowers or is it the acreage of lawn that you convert from sterile green water sponge to a naturally sustainable and healthy environment?

Use the old-timey mower when work is slow or for special occasions or whatever.  Otherwise, be efficient with your time so you can put it to the most good and make your business the best it can be.

If you're selling Coca leaves for a ""little between your check and gum"" it would take quite a while to accumulate necessary amounts to be able to make cocaine, also it would be prohibitively expensive.

You'll never remove the demand, if you think that you can remove the demand you are either seriously delusional, or you believe that you have a moral philosophy which puts you on a higher plane.   But the reality is that mammals like to alter their consciousness, little kids will spin around, hold their breath, huff glue, huff compressed air.  Other mammals eat marijuana, they eat fermenting vegetables, cats like catnip, etc. etc.

So you can either manage it so that doesn't present itself as a bigger problem to the general populace (legalization), you still have the impact of the drug use, but that is all.  It's a self selecting problem.

Or you can try to deny a human what he feels he needs, thereby keeping the first problem the impact of drug use, a second problem, people who are only interested in Marijuana being exposed to all types of illegal drugs.  All the while creating a bigger third and forth problem (Criminals profiting, criminals using violence to conduct business), and the unintended consequence of a fifth problem, needing to create a para-milatary type of police force, to contend with the Criminals.  Which leads to a sixth problem the police become only equipped to deal with para-military type operations, which means you have an eighth problem the general populace is actually at risk from the police, which leads to the ninth problem that the general populace distrusts the police.  Which is what we have now, I'm sure I'm forgetting about a handful of problems.  Oh yeah prison overcrowding for Marijuana possession, which means we need private companies to run prisons because we have so many and they cost so much.  The cost of law enforcement going up because we need to have these para-military type police forces, which means they need to be privatized.

So either legal or illegal you still have the impact of the drug use.  If however it's kept illegal you create 10+ more problems.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Only ""ironic"" if you don't know or understand what Juvenile Diabetes is, or is caused by.

Also called Type 1, juvenile diabetes is an autoimmune disorder where the body turns against and destroys the portions of the pancreas (islets of langerhans) responsible for producing insulin. It doesn't have anything to do with diet or lifestyle, and generally occurs in young patients (though not always). My brother was diagnosed in the 7th grade, for example. 

Type II, or what they used to call ""adult onset"" diabetes, is the one strongly associated with weight and lifestyle choices. Not everyone who has this problem is chubby and sedentary, but when you hear a large adult complain about their diabetes, odds are they have type II. This isn't caused by sugar intake, either, to be perfectly clear, but does at least have a correlation with lifestyle generally.

(There's a third kind that happens to some pregnant women called gestational diabetes, but the big 2 are the ones I list above.)

Do I have to explain this to you again? 

&gt;That's like saying 'you are republican or democrat' - even in a two party system you share common parts from either or alternativly reject the notion entirely and fall into 'undeceided'.

You've severely misunderstood the entire definition and concept of atheism. It only addresses one single specific issue, namely theistic belief. Any beliefs, values etc. in addition to that is outside of its scope.

If you hold a belief in a deity, you're a theist. 

If you do not hold a belief in a deity, you're an atheist. 

Atheist literally means 'not theist'.

Even if that difference were caused by sexism (which I don't think it entirely is), it would not be sexist to acknowledge its existence and to make predictions based on it.

Society has certain expectations of men and different expectations of women (some of which are probably nothing more than sexist values enshrined in the culture, but some of them may have underlying biological or psychological roots - it's pretty complex).  Given that those expectations are different, however, it means that certain actions mean that the individual is actively thwarting those expectations if they're a woman, but not if they're a man.  That means that guesses as to the underlying factors that would cause someone to choose to thwart society's expectations apply to one, but not the other.

Is it sexist to talk about a woman's biological clock ticking in her mid to late thirties when you wouldn't say that of a man?  No, because the situations aren't the same.","1306888722"

There is almost no chance that you are going to get a positive response. Either don't do the one night stand, or don't do something that you think is too risky. However, if you rephrased the question ""Have you been recently tested for STDs"" you would increase the probability of having a better response. I'm not disagreeing with your concern for safety. But at the end of the day, there is little chance that you will not kill the mood, based on how people emotionally function. My suggestion is either take the risk, or don't go down on the girl if you want to get laid. If you really don't care if you get laid or not, then ask. It is up to you. No right or wrong answer. But I find the whole concept in engaging in promiscuous sex, and in a moment of passion, stopping the energy and suddenly being ""safe"" a little odd. Promiscuous sex is inherently risky. Even if they are not offended, they will lie if they want to get their rocks off. And never ask a girl if she is clean. What girl would respond ""No, I'm dirty."" If you don't want to have sex with women unless they have been recently tested, then ask them if they have been tested. But if you are that concerned, it sounds like you should not be having one night stands or sex on the first date. Wait until the relationship has matured enough to be able to ask the question in a non-offensive way. Or, just fuck her with a condom on and don't go down on her, and don't let her go down on you without a condom. ","1306888733"

Julian stared into himself through the bathroom mirror.

Time ticked to ten minutes, and his new mask was ready

To perform for the crowd he would soon give himself before.

____________________________________________________________

Julian and his hair, sat and stayed right there,

By the park bench where he saw the concrete hearts of

Passersby who toiled tiredly at the arts of moving and sweating.

It was here, that money felt its grasp and Julian knew that

Friends could not be earned by clothes nor could the populace

Be swayed by odes of spikes and studs and metal leather belts.

And on this which Julian declared his day,

The oozes of product marketed by the suits in the building on his right

He poured across his sea of hair, this chemical atrocity,

Proving he'd be bound no more by the chains of corporate monstrosity.

____________________________________________________________

And leaving his perch upon the park bench,

Julian returned to his nurture station, this loving nest,

Built by unfair business practice, ethics lost to reason.

Julian washed out his hair and resigned his life of treason.

And most importantly, how are they supposed to get them to stop? Suing them won't do shit, for the reasons I listed above.

"occult","t5_2qhmc","As a Rosicrucian we say we are perfecting to remind us of the great work we have to do. 

The main premise of the Rosicrucian's is a planned method of study regarding metaphysics. It is non denominational with a lot of reference to Egyptology. It starts with basic philosophical concepts to help build a foundation of knowledge. As time passes the same topics are discussed again in greater detail and experiments and applications are given so the student can gain insight and practical experience while shaping their paradigm from what often is a very restricted way of thinking. Nothing is forced, no phone calls, no harrasing, no handing out flowers at the airport. lol.

For anyone with a background in metaphysics the beginning studies are difficult because the concepts are familiar. 

Rituals are a large part of Rosicrucian tradition, from blessing your food, to periods of study and meditations. For instance, with blessing the food you perform many tasks at once.

Water has been tested after being blessed by Yogis and there is a change on a molecular level. The act of blessing gives us pause, recognition to the Universe and we always ask to share the benefits we gain spiritually from the food with all others. There is also the Pavlovian response of blessing the food. The body automatically begins to prepare for digestion as soon as you start thinking about the blessing this makes you a  more efficient machine. And another benefit, for those of us who meditate, it is a reminder to take the time to be here and now and enjoy the food to the fullest extent your senses can.

Probably the most important part of rituals are they set into motion the intent behind them. From this physical world intent my be our most powerful force available to us.

Rituals also remind us to be humble. Perhaps my favorite slice of the pie. Some people are lucky enough to already be mindful, aware, thankful, humble, and here and now every moment of their lives and the rest of us are working on it.","1306888773"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","&gt;""Sorry, I thought was obvious that I was exaggerating a tiny bit. But in my exaggeration I tried show how I feel people are acting in regards to this.""

&gt;""I was also not intending to imply Frailed was saying that.""

I was aware. My point was that someone (Frailed) took the time to reply to you and give you his reason for disliking the iOS notification system, and your response was about how you feel about the people who you say have ""rage"" about a feature they simply do not like. Did Frailed not show you that not everyone is enraged? In fact, I don't know that I've seen much rage about this. I'd invite you to post linked to this rage.

I was simply pointing out that he didn't seem to conform to the stereotype that you've created in your own mind about those who dislike the iOS push notification system, yet you still replied to him and pushed the stereotype. That was the point I was trying to make. Again, I guess I just don't see the ""rage"" you are talking about. I see lots of people who dislike a feature and who are vocal about that. That's not rage.

&gt;""I just can't get my head why people would want to buy a new phone just because of the notifications.""

What do you mean? Do you mean that people are switching from the iPhone to an Android device simply because of the push notifications system? I haven't heard anything about this happening. I'm not saying that a few people haven't because a few people will do *anything*, but it's certainly not happening in numbers that are meaningful. Further, those who really hate the iOS push notification system can (and do) jailbreak their iPhones and install a utility that mimics the Android notification system. Maybe that's not what you meant, though, and I'm reading it wrong...

If you mean that people are going to replace their iPhone 4 with the next model just to get a new notification system, that's also not the case. iOS 4 is the current version and it runs on the iPhone 4, but iOS 5 will also run on that same model iPhone, so no one is talking about getting a new iPhone in order to get a new push notification system. They'll get it whether they get a new iPhone or not (assuming they have an iPhone 4 right now, and iOS 5 *might* even run on the 3GS, although we don't know that yet).","1306888776"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","The problem with bickering is that it snowballs quickly into a habit, especially when you're in a comfortable relationship because bickering becomes part of what defines that comfort after a while if you let it get out of hand. 

The strategies you want to use are open communication. I know that sounds silly when talking about stopping pointless and hurtful chatter, but it's true. You need to let your boyfriend know what things he often does to get you upset, and he needs to work on not doing those things -and visa versa- you both need to work on being more aware of the other. Bickering is generally based on annoyances from previous bickering, so you need to air out those annoyances and deal with them now. Respectfully air these out, otherwise you are once more stuck with even more bickering. 

It's a great sign that you're both not only aware of the bickering problem, but that you're worried about it. That means that you are both willing and capable of change, and that's really all you need. Talk it through.","1306888793"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I tried it a little bit. I don't recall details, I just remember finding it massively disappointing because I was comparing it to the original Deadlands rules. The magic in the original Deadlands was very distinctive, and each type of magic-user had totally different rules and a very different flavor. This made it a bitch to GM but gave it a very distinctive feel. Savage Worlds took all the magic use, prechewed it all, and then spat it all out at you. Every magic user worked basically the same way and none of them were very interesting. And then they tried to distinguish between the classes by limiting what kinds of effects each one could make... so the blessed were the only ones who could heal people. Which then makes the blessed into your garden variety cleric, and suddenly you've got AD&amp;D classes, pretty much.

Ugh. For me, one of the most distinctive mental pictures from the Deadlands original rules was the healing magic that Hucksters had: a hex that let you heal nasty wounds, but you had to sit beside the wounded person and all you could do was compulsively play hand after hand of solitaire poker, for hours at a time. It was a really distinctive piece of flavor, that really made me visualize the hexslingers as completely distinct from the shaman and so forth.

In the Savage Worlds Deadlands sourcebook, there isn't anything like that. It's all just flat and frankly uninteresting.

I'm probably not being fair to Savage Worlds: the original Deadlands rules were among the most intriguing I have ever seen, and the new ones were among the least, and that colored my vision of the entire system. But honestly, I like rules-heavy systems that integrate heavily with their worlds (D&amp;D 1st through 3.5 ed, Shadowrun), rules-heavy systems that are very generic (GURPS, Hero System), rules-light systems that integrate heavily with their worlds (Feng Shui), and rules-light systems that are very generic (can't think of any off the top of my head, but I know there are several that I've played). Savage Worlds just didn't excite me.

I just remembered what one of the other problems I had with it was: in my introduction to it (testing a game for a convention for a friend), I borrowed a book, and we had the setting described to us. I came up with three character concepts and sat down with the rulebook and couldn't make any of them work. It was just bad luck that I picked things that there was no convenient way to model in Savage Worlds, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.","1306888796"

I then find out that secretly this was a three way call and that burned friend was listening in but not speaking (I was 28 at the time). This information was then funneled to his sister in-law who would then cause trouble at my new job (she worked there). I then told third friend how burned friend slept with his ex-girlfriend and her roommate on the same night and then boasted the story to all of our mutual friends (true). I am almost certain that his sister in-law was on the line, possibly in addition to his wife because I have never not heard such uncomfortable silence as I did on that call.

So we ought to teach creationism alongside evolution in schools? It seems as if your line of reasoning supports this conclusion. Just because there is a loud group of people with an alternative idea does not automatically give the idea weight or merit. Creationism does a terrible job of explaining the origins of life because it insists on its own story, not the fossil evidence from the real world. Austrians run into similar problems with their own little narrative and ""fossil evidence,"" so like creationists they just throw it away entirely.

There are numerous other parallels here. Heck, why not let miasma theories of disease into medical journals? Because they fail the litmus test of science. Just like the Austrian school.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My worst living situations haven't been nearly as bad as the ones already mentioned, but here goes.

My first story is from subleasing 3 months at an apartment with one of my friends. The girls that used to live there told us we'd have the 4 bedroom townhome to ourselves. Wrong. We lived with the most obnoxious surprise roommate. While the actual apartment wasn't bad, living with her was. We'd constantly have 5 people in our living room at any given hour partying/whatever, some that she didn't even know (some that had sex on my couch that I got to walk in on). I worked at 4am each morning so this was complete shit. She'd leave out dirty pans with standing grease for weeks and also left food (as in entire pork chops) on the floors of our apartment and patio. On top of living in the shithole she created and having to clean everything before our move-out day, she never paid the bills. This left us with the electric and gas bill for her and her 5 friends for those three months. The bills cost as much as my rent if not more, basically.

My second story is my current situation. I live on a second floor apartment. Basically everything was fine until the downstairs neighbors moved in. They have no regard for anyone and are constantly at my door threatening to beat the shit out of us. Supposedly this is because we asked them to turn their music off when it set off a car alarm. They did this for 18 hours a day for the first month they lived here and I've had to call the cops on them countless times because of violence/excessive noise. Now they just play their music at that level for a few hours during any point of the day or if they notice I'm home. But the violence and wall-punching continues and management won't do anything about it. So we're moving. At least management isn't replacing the millionth window they've broken at their place.","1306888811"

"reddit.com","t5_6","First, having and using a credit card is *not* the same thing as being in debt. I have three normal cards and one healthcare card, but I have never made an interest payment and never will. In fact, these companies pay *me*; I get a 3% rebate on all Amazon purchases, a 5% rebate at groceries and drugstores, and 1-1.5% back on everything else.

Second, there's a big difference between responsible and irresponsible uses of debt. In economics, there is a notion that debt is a way for people or organizations to equalize their spending power over their lifetimes. You're borrowing against expected future resources to pay for today's costs.

If you're using those resources to build your economic or intellectual capital, e.g. by buying a home or by going to school, then it can be a very wise and responsible decision. (It can also be a terrible idea, but the point is that both are possible.)

For example: I financed a large part of my education with private student loans; I took out $60,000 at 5-6% interest. I now have a very well-paying job, and my loans will be fully paid off in a few months, about two years after graduation. Without that education, I would be *significantly* worse off.

Yes, there are some people who simply do not have the knowledge or discipline to use credit properly. But that doesn't change the fact that debt is a very effective economic tool for many people.","1306888818"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt;To start with... I think you are somewhat conflating anarchist and socialist -- which happens a lot. Socialism, as it is most commonly conceived, usually implies a bureaucratic form of government -- and guess what, anarchists are opposed to that.

What?  Anarchist have been calling themselves socialist from the very beginning.  I'm obviously not using a definition used by most people.  I'm also not using the definition of anarchism used by most people but I don't know why I'm telling you this.  All anarchist from Proudhon, Bakunin, to Kropotkin all called themselves socialist.  The (A) FAQ to the book No Gods No Masters all refer to anarchist as socialist.  None of them use socialism to mean bureaucratic form of government and are all against it.   

&gt;Beyond that... there is more to being an anarchist than owning the means of production -- much more.In fact, I don't think that's  necessarily part of the anarchist criteria at all. Anarchists primarily are opposed to centralized power and in favor of personal and collective freedom -- whether or not individuals or groups want to own the factories they work at.

Please tell me specifically, do you think workers should run, operate, or own their workplace.  That's what anarchist mean by being a socialist.  If you don't believe that, please give me the alternative. (And please don't go around this question by saying there is more to anarchism.  I know that.  Everybody here knows that).    

The problem here is that anarchist believe in decentralized power and the best way to achieve this is by socialization.  Again, I'm obviously not using this in a statist way.  

&gt;And anarchists are opposed to BOTH of those things. No need to confuse the issue by pretending otherwise.

Anarchist are leftist because they are socialist.  The left/right divide has nothing to do with the state.  Never has either.  If you are an anarchist you are by definition a leftist.  Sorry.  Just look up the term left-wing politics.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics  It actually mentions Anarchist in the first paragraph.  

You are not beyond the political spectrum.  You are apart of it.  I don't get to call myself a timeless-spaceless-ist.  I am a left-ist.  I believe that workers should own and run the workplace which makes me a socialist and a leftist.  

&gt;The point is... you don't need Marx to be opposed to these things. You don't need Marxist roots to be an anarchist. 

I said as much in my original post. I'm not particularly influenced by Marx.  However, anarchism as a political, economic, and social movement originated in reaction to Marx.  Many of the anarchist including Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin agreed with many aspect of what Marx had to say while also rejecting other aspects of his work. Either way, Marx has played a heavy role in anarchism even if anarchist aren't explicitly Marxist.  

&gt;Again... no need to confuse the issue.

Like most post-left anarchist it is you who is confusing the issue.  You have not and will not define anything.  When you do, you leave yourself out of your own analysis.  All anarchist are socialist and are therefore leftist.  Sorry.  I hate calling myself a socialist too but that's what I am. Furthermore, you have still not told be how post-left anarchist have made any differences in society.  What issues trump the protest movement that you so hate?  I mean, that's one of the big post-left anarchist positions yet I can't think of anything productive and transformative they've done. Please let us all know.

here is an example of how i will wear my pants.

1. i have a 33 waist- i will buy my pants at a 36 waist so they are baggy.(the baggier the more bounces you get as well as that is just the ""style"" on the field. I say this becuase that is what you are interested in)

2. If your son wears an Adult small t-shirt buy him an adult large jersey.


Also, if it doesnt end up fitting correctly(the jersey should be Huge. Honestly. The pants on the other hand should be able to be tightened so they dont fall off his waist. if the pants fall off his waist they are too big)","1306888837"

Think of it this way.  Government is a cancer, and lobbyists are the anti-bodies that businesses use to protect themselves from the destructive power of government.  Currently, the most ""fit"" businesses are the ones who have the best lobbyist/immune system, who can destroy the power of government, or better yet, use government to destroy a competitor.  

In the absence of a cancer like government, businesses could fire all their lobbyists, and use the savings to increase corporate profits.  And merge into one super-conglomerate that treats the entire world like a company store, wringing every last bit of value of human life away from nearly every inhabitant of the planet, and turning a small group of oligopolists into gods.

"hxcsny","t5_2sie2","Holly, I did see your ideas in education in earliest posts.  I said to myself that you are a wonderful teacher with a lot of ideas and initatives.  HXNY is lucky to have you as a teacher.  However with additional posts from you, it seemed the tone changed.  I guessed you were just angry at something.  Anyway that is not my point.  

My point is about you message that I need to clarify.  By the way, I did not know Min personally and did not know he was your husband.  Apparently he sent the message to me instead of just the parents in G1C1 as you mentioned.  This has gone beyond the intended targets as mentioned.  I believe the message even went to hundreds of other parents, like me, who had no interests in knowing any speculated accusations without hard evidence. 

Do you know the famous ""The Martians are coming."" in 1938?  It caused panic to the public.  Is it a responsible act to blindly pass something that was spread by **anonymous** without concrete evidence?  His intention may be good in providing information to his fellow parents.  However was it something reasonable to do by an educated adult when it was sent to hundreds of other parents?

Just to remind you that he also added his own statement in the forwarded message about one female candidate has zero interest in education.  In this case, he was not just passing the message with impartial mindset but with intention to influence other parents.

I feel very sorry about the way you felt how the message was replied to your husband.  It was meant to serve as a reminder to people that adults should behave like adults and deal with issues in mature and constructive ways.

Yes, everyone has the rights to know the facts and truth.  However only the educated ones know when and where to stop spreading of rumors.  谣言止于智者. 难道有人不愿做为智者,而甘愿做被牵着鼻子走的人?

At the end, I felt exactly the same way in your conclusion regarding the officials in HXNY.  However during a crisis like this, we need to keep a cool head to work together and not to be taken advantages of by those bad-apples who try to break up the School.  Don’t you think so too?

Purportedly, we're stepping in to bomb the hell out of Gaddafi because he's being inhumane, attacking his own people who just want him to go away because they've dealt with his bullshit too long.  Gaddafi wants to stay in power, so he hires mercenaries and drags out the parts of the military who like him enough to shoot his own people.

The UN and the US say ""This must stop!  Silly Libyan, Gaddafi!  You can't kill other Libyans!""  And so we send in the warplanes, the bombs, the ships, the special forces, to keep him from squashing the resistance.  Effectively, we're interfering in a civil war..  Frankly, it's not our fucking business.  We're pretty broke over here as it is and I really thing we have our own house to clean before we can go stomping around in other peoples' countries.

""But!"" you say, ""He's killing his own people!""  And I think that's reprehensible.  I don't like him, and I'm glad *somebody's* bombing the shit out of him.  But to assume that we're doing it because the US Gov't is full of Good Guys(tm) is naive.  The weight of evidence piles up that we're not doing it ""because Gaddafi is killing his own people and needs to be stopped.""  We're probably doing it because he's sitting on gobs of oil (see the Lockerbie bomber being released with secret backroom negotiations taking place to grant BP better access to Libyan oil: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6814939.ece ).  Just like the major reasons we stormed into Iraq were bacause Bush Jr. wanted a war to play because every great president is defined by a war (...and that's not a direct quote, but that's paraphrasing what he said to a journalist well before he even got into office...) as well as the fact that Good Ol'e Cheney wanted his buddies at Halliburton to get stinking rich (and the evidence for that is the no-bid contracts that went to his buddies in spite of the fact that they were responsible for the deaths not only of US soldiers, due to shoddy work, but also to contractors they hired for pennies on the dollar to drive half-destroyed trucks across the most heavily contested terrain in the country)...  And yet it was called ""Operation Iraqi Freedom!"".

The other major problem I have with the assumption that we're just out there doing good is that Syria's rulers are killing their own people...  Same in Bahrain...  but what do we do?  A whole lot of nothing.  We even turn a blind eye while our ""allies,"" the Saudis, march into Bahrain to provide ""security forces"" to their neighbor...  You know, in the form of military personnel...  But we can't piss of the Saudis!  They're the ones who vote to produce more oil to bring the price of a barrel down every time the US starts wincing from the economic pressures.

The simple fact of the matter is that the US runs on oil.  Our government and our business leaders have guaranteed that that will be the case for as long as oil can be purchased...  For fuck's sake, the automotive industry back in the day bought up all the mass transit systems they could and dismantled them because it was direct competition for their cars, and they wanted more money.  Anything that the Gov't can do to get more oil cheaper to the US, they will.  That is the sole major factor in all of our dealings in the Middle East.  That's been the case since the end of WWII.  That was Rumsfeld's and Wolfowitz's major concern for nearly forty years, and that's on the record.  That's why they were two of the loudest people cheering for the invasion of Iraq.

You accuse me of having no sense of context or nuance.  I have plenty of context, and I laid some of it out for you.  I also have plenty of nuance, but the simple matter of the fact is that the people who are making the decision have no nuance.  They're about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the side of the head.  It's not my fault that they making it so obvious.  You also tell me that I have no interest in knowing the truth, or care about what the best policies are.  I don't give two shits about points.  I look at my karma and laugh when I get down-voted.  I make sure I'm very well aware of what's happening, and I make it my business to research when I can.  You look at one link that happens to reference information on an Alex Jones website and completely ignore that I also linked to Fox News (which I personally detest) and Uganda's Leading Website.  They all say the same thing, corroborating the information set forth by a retired Colonel and an active duty Lt. Colonel in an interview. (No boots on the ground, my ass!)

At this point, the US can not leave Gaddafi in power.  We've screwed that particular pooch.  There have also been many reports coming out of news sources such as Al Jazeera and NPR, both of which I consider to be fine reporting agencies, that the rebels in Libya are running out of cash.  There was even an interview on NPR with the guy they got over there to be their finance minister, and he had to resort to robbing the local state banks to pay for things.  The money they stole was a paltry sum, so they're negotiating with the banks who have all of Gaddafi's funds frozen, trying to get loans with those accounts being used as collateral.  They're broke!  They can't pay for weapons, they can't pay for food, they can't pay for salaries, they have no source of income that they can use for international purchases, as all the money they stole from the bank is paper.  You can't buy shit on the international markets with paper.  We've thrown our lot in with them and can't afford to let Gaddafi win...  therefore, since they rebels are broke, untrained, and likely to lose...  they're going to need *somebody's* boots.  My prediction is that we'll have to augment the special forces units already there with some ground-pounding grunts.  I may be wrong, but I'm very likely correct in assuming that the rebels will be getting some serious under-the-table assistance from the US and the UN.

So, now that I've written this book (which I fully expect you will not read), one would think it's quite obvious that I'm no half-wit conspiracy theorist.  I understand a certain amount of economics and diplomacy and have read enough history and current events to see trends.  I base my opinions on those trends and the best you can muster as an argument against me is ""Herp-derp, Alex Jones lizard Bilderberg aliens!"".  I don't even care about the court of public opinion, so you and your friends (or alternate accounts) can vote me down all you want.  It doesn't change the fact that you're making ad hominem attacks instead of arguments and you have yet to say anything here worth to two cents.

I signed up for exactly that reason (actually, to avoid being homeless a third time) - I picked an MOS (military job) that more or less guaranteed I wouldn't be kicking down doors, 25B - Information System Operator/Analyst and spent six years either working directly with computers or working in a unit that specialized in computers (being the supply monkey for a Signal unit is still better than being in combat).

I did deploy to Iraq, and during my year spent there I spent 8 hours a day staring at a video feed to make sure it wasn't disrupted.  If it ever was, I ran to a server room to cycle power on the equipment there, which fixed the problem 99% of the time.

We got mortared twice.

Now I'm done with active duty and in college, courtesy of the GI Bill.   It also pays my rent.  I don't live in a palace, mind you, but I don't live in a fucking dump where I have to keep large dogs and a shotgun for fear of being robbed and murdered, either.

If you decide to go the military route to get yourself into a better position to pursue a civilian career, and you make the right choices regarding branch and military job, then you actually stand a pretty good chance of making it out in one piece, GI Bill in hand.

On the other hand, if you sign up as an infantryman you'll get what you asked for.

Edit:  For the record, I've never approved of the wars in the middle east, but guess what?   The Department of Defense is going to fill those boots one way or another, so I might as well get my college paid for in the meantime.   

My best buddy is about to start law school.  He already has something like 30,000 dollars in student debt.   By the time he's done with law school it'll be closer to 80,000.    Assuming he can get hired at a law firm right away, he should be able to pay that off in less than two years.

I have zero debt, and enough savings to give me plenty of wiggle room when it comes to life emergencies like flat tires.  And I'm still saving since I'm living off the GI Bill.   I don't really know what I want to do for a career (suppose I could become a systems engineer), but I've got time to think about it.

Also, I'd like to let everyone know that Chihuly works are kind of over-hyped. They look really cool in pictures and also they look really nice solo in a hotel lobby or in an atrium, but as the subject of an entire exhibit, it is kind of boring.  Honestly, the man hit on something that people like and its almost effortless to churn out these ideas over and over and over, each one just like the last. And the kicker is that Chihuly hasn't handled glass in years, he has assistants that do all the work for him.  Sadly, he even displays his ""paintings"" as if his work as a glass artist would give them any clout.  They're so basic in content and subject matter and so amateur in technique.

Bumbershoot in Seattle had laser ticket scanners for their entry to the main stage area. Their exit policy was a single 16 year old volunteer. Crying. With a bingo dauber. That was out of ink. The sign indicated you had to get a stamp (daub?) to be readmitted. People were SCREAMING at this poor girl and not a One Reel employee was to be seen. This 'stamp for re-entry' thing obviously turned out to be false due to their massive failure to provide even mildly acceptable exit procedures. The POINT of laser ticket scanning for re-entry is that you can also scan at the exit, which prevents me from getting two people in, exiting alone and then using the same ticket again. Wrist bands do the same thing and cost less than the $5600 a good wireless hand scanner costs. Fucking amatures. Also, this festival has been going on for roughly 35 or so years, so it's not like they're new to this. I also heard the will call lines were like 3 hours long but I can't confirm that.

I quit smoking weed with no trouble and from my point of view, the people who seem 'addicted' don't really want to quit; this may even be due to personal opinions of users, personalities, etc. So the real issue is to look at all variables in conjunction with marijuana instead of claiming it IS definitively addictive.","1306888880"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Heh. I think I am pretty confident nowadays. I suppose I was just saying all that on reddit because nobody else wants to listen. It's better than just talking to myself about it.

Sometimes you might feel like she's ignoring you and stuff, you know? When really it's just paranoia... but you're never sure, so you panic about it.

The evidence thus far is that she does like me. But as I said, some things just confuse me and leave me thinking about it, when I probably don't need to.

It's illogical, I know. I might send her a text and not get a response back for a few hours. My brain creates all these wacky ideas for why she might not be replying. 95% of the time though, nothing at all obscure was going on. She had to go and take the dog for a walk. Something like that.

The way she talks about her male friends makes me anxious, but again, I don't think I'm being rational. She said the other day: ""We met some guys from &lt;suchandsuch&gt; so we're gonna hang out with them instead of going to &lt;randomplace&gt;.

My immediate thought is: ""Oh god! She'll be swept off her feet by her new found friends!""

If I were to be rational (which isn't always easy in these scenarios) I'd have thought: ""She's probably talking about just a bunch of friends, maybe even girls, she's referred to her girl-friends as guys before... no need to panic.""

Sometimes I even think she's trying to get me to be jealous. I'm sure she'd deny that, but she speaks to me differently from my other male friends who know her... I'm pretty sure she's not trying to discourage me. She'd just be straight forward about it. She was to a friend of mine. (That was a bad week. He told me he liked her, and I was about to tell him the exact same thing. I didn't after that - I was pretty sure she wasn't especially interested so I didn't say anything to him.) May have been the wrong decision... in the past now anyway.

In conclusion, I'm just speaking my mind. It's nice, even if nobody is listening. I know I sound worried, but I think everyone is like that. I do my best to be rational about it, and it definitely helps. I'm not a push over, and I am confident around her. I can tell her most things without fear.

We'll see how it goes.","1306888881"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I agree with you. I became suspicious when the title simply said ""muslims"" did it, not radical or fanatical muslims - I'm an atheist, and as concerned about religious violence as anyone else, but this article was clearly written to demonize muslims as a group, and not much else. You can't claim to have reason on your side without being reasonable yourself, and when it's this easy to discredit the original source (based on an in my opinion more trustworthy source) it should raise an eyebrow. 

I'll probably get down voted for this, but as a secular humanist the demonizing of muslims going on in Europe concerns me almost as much as islam itself does. It creates hatred for a group of people of whom the vast majority will be innocent, and we all remember what happened the last time we allowed that to happen. Islam - along with the rest of religion - should be fought by attacking the IDEA of religion, not the people who practices it - that is a battle no one can win, and one that could very well lead to a new world war. Little by little, rational and reasonable people must speak up, always respecting other people, without respecting their ideas. 

This article - at least in this form - stinks of propaganda. That being said, the sad part is that I wouldn't be surprised if it was true, but I accept nothing without evidence, so for now I'll go with the version that actually names a source - to me, that counts.","1306888886"

"anime","t5_2qh22","I think he's always been trying to show how love can only be suppressed but not eradicated. If he was trying to show that you don't always end up with your first love, then he would have ended the story with Asuka. Imo, he did not spend very much time developing Asuka as a character prior and during the dating period. Yeah there's some form of it while she's dating Haruto. However, it felt very weak and subtle compare to even Akari or Nanami, let alone Eba. To top it off, Haruto always says something like ""No one can understand this but this is nice"" referring to the fact that the two of them just hang around together in his room with no romantic progress. It alludes to the idea that he thinks he's in love with Asuka but it's not as deep as his suppressed feelings for Eba. If the author had paired up Haruto with Akari or Nanami, this manga would have been a lot more intense imo.


You're right, it'll be interesting to see how he deals with Asuka and his friends with Eba. I think the only way to salvage this is to have him run away with Eba after breaking up with Asuka. Having everyone just forgive him is just too conveniently easy. It creates little depth. But I do think the manga's going to end soon too. I hope there's enough screen time of Haruto and Eba dating officially together before the end though because there's a lackluster of that for nearly half the manga.","1306888887"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","&gt;Their nature was a result of the Overmind being programmed to destroy all life.

See, this is SC2 retcons you're bringing in. In SC1, the overmind was just a Xel'Naga experiment that backfired, like a loose tiger in a zoo eating all the caretakers and moving out to the streets.

&gt;Kerrigan is still a bit of a fierce bitch.

Nope. She tries hard to be ""badass"", which just comes off as extremely schizophrenic when she also says something like ""Oh, I did some bad things back then, didn't I? :C""

&gt;What I meant was, the races aren't completely good or evil as a race.

**That's not what black and white morality is!** A whole race doesn't have to be evil for the story to be mostly black and white. All you need is this: Bad people are BAD, good people are GOOD. (As opposed to gray morality, and the real world, where every single person is a mix of both to varying degrees.)

But fair enough, I do agree that the races aren't one-dimensional, but that's beside the point.

&gt;The Zerg arc now is similar to the Orc arc that culminated with Grom freeing them from the demon bloodlust curse. 

This is not a good thing. It's formulaic and predictable. 

&gt;Former enemies uniting against a common ""black"" is a common theme, especially in Blizzard games. Just as Warcraft had the Burning Legion, SC2 has the Xel'naga. I'll be interested to see how the Protoss storyline unfolds now that these creatures they've largely worshipped as gods are bent on destroying them.

Exactly. Recently (post-BW), Blizzard have been prone to using the same tired old plots in all their games, as well as removing any sense of gray morality.

This is fine, by the way, for fantasy or sci-fi, but they're continuing a story here. A story that was a very different beast. It makes the two games feel disconnected and is the one reason why a lot of the fans of the SC1 campaign are rather disappointed. I don't want Warcraft 3 in space, I want a continuation of Brood Wars.","1306888898"

&gt;AND/OR have the option public moderation logs, ban disputes, or otherwise some form of checks and balances to moderator's power.

While I certainly agree with the sentiment that large subreddits should not give (potential) total control to the most senior mod, I wouldn't go so far as ask the admins to create a special moderation system like the one you describe. Since these sorts of incidents are (as far as I'm aware) quite rare, I think it would be better for the admins to establish an policy of being willing to use their power to unseat mods, or to lower their seniority, **in subreddits of (say) more than 10,000 subscribers or so,** *only when the community is overwhelmingly in favor of it, and other mods support it as well.*

Asking the admins to create a system for such a rare event is not needed, **if** the admins are willing to step in on behalf of the community and manually change whatever needs to be changed.

&gt;AND/OR have the option public moderation logs, ban disputes, or otherwise some form of checks and balances to moderator's power.

Simply providing the community with that sort of information alone isn't going to help oust a rogue mod. Allowing the option for such information to be open would be a great idea, though.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","What part of your back was feeling affected? Typically lower back pain that is induced from riding is caused by tight IT bands. They essentially stretch from the outside of your knee to your bottom of your lower back. When cycling, or more typically running, your legs tighten and your lower back begins to compensate for this lack of motion and power output. Unfortunately your lower back isn't nearly as strong as your legs and it runs out of energy and pain occurs quickly. Be sure to stretch before every ride, every time you stop and especially post ride too.

As per the upper body, as mentioned by others, core workouts will help along with realigning your riding posture. It sounds like you might be riding in a too aggressive stance. The bike fitter should be able to refocus and make adjustments that will help.

I had similar issues, more so on focused on my lower back, after on my first long rides (STP) and found that getting a solid bike fit and constant stretching and core workouts help out immensely.","1306888901"

Both insects and birds are sensitive to the UV light that the web reflects. As some insects are attracted to UV, they fly towards it. Birds and other large animals, on the other hand, see an obstacle and avoid it.

The argument for it not being intended to make the spider look bigger is that it really doesn't want to advertise its location to predatory birds and wasps. Why make yourself a more visible target?

TL;DR: The spider doesn't want to make itself look bigger as this will attract predatory birds and wasps.","1306888904"

"ADD","t5_2r82v","I loved your video. I actually subscribed to your channel just because of it... I've still to check out the rest of the fun and random ones. =P

I understand not all of us react the same way to adhd, but I can say that I'm pretty much just like you. It was really hard to watch your video because I could pretty much see myself saying those same words, that I've actually said many times before. I also hate having to admit I'm somewhat limited by adhd, but the way college is, I have no other choice. I need as much leverage as I can get because I always miss my deadlines. I'm forgetful when it comes to simple, mundane tasks. I almost always forget, for example, my student id. As a consequence, I usually get barred on my way to class. It's exasperating when you have to explain to some administrative personnel that you are forgetful and however much you try to remember things, it's just not something you can control. I'm actually having problems with this right now, and I've been barred and exposed to a very humiliating lecture while standing outside the building I was supposed to go in for class, with people passing by an just watching me try to explain my way in from outside the bars. (I'm seriously considering a lawsuit for abuse of authority and opprobium)

The meds are also a problem. I get tachycardia when I use my medication for more than 4 days straight. I eat less too.

Classes are a drag, even the interesting ones. Assignments don't get done until a couple of hours before the deadline (from scratch), when they do. I can do so much more than the people surrounding me... It's not that I'm better or smarter, it's just that I really could, if the system let me.

I went through school flawlessly, without effort. It was varied. Many classes a day. For a while, everything was new and sparkly. Then it was all too easy and insipid, but easy enough. If you sit on the back of the class you can talk your way through classes. I would also skip classes a lot, and still manage the best grades in my class. =\ Now it's the other way around... I can't even miss classes because here we have a law that demands a 75% attendance ratio, and adhd is not considered a learning disorder... not by the law.

Sorry... too much. I actually felt like sharing. I usually do. You said you do too, in a way. You said you were shameless. Yet I don't think you are. I might be mistaken here. After all, I'm using myself as a reference, but I think you were actually pretty embarrassed while making that video. Your eyes looked like that to me. I also think I'm very shameless at times, but the truth is that I'm very, very shy. It's just that I get this impulse, this urge to do things. I go all out and only when it's done that I get to feel embarrassed. It's like my reactions are too fast even for my own emotions. If I'm given a proper warning  though, like if I have to make a presentation, I get time enough to feel self-conscious about it as hell.

Good luck to you. I know you'll need it too.","1306888907"

[**The Orange Box**](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/) is a logical first step, considering it has the first Portal, as well as Half Life 2 (plus Ep1 and 2), and Team Fortress 2, which -- aside from the Left4Dead games -- is a pretty well rounded Source-game experience.

Also, I just finished playing through **The Witcher 2** (incidentally bought through Amazon instead of Steam, but it's on Steam and that's beside the point), and it's one of the best action / RPGs I've played in a long, long time. [The first one](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20900/) is solid, too. It's often on sale, but right now it's $20.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt;It's pretty easy. You write up a complaint that a task was not completed.

I don't know if you've ever been in a plant, but generally a ""task"" is something accomplished by a group of people working together on a shift; things like mail sorting are not an individual effort. If a shift is slow, it's usually because one or more people are not performing up to standard. The problem is as it stands there is no objective way to single out the individuals not doing their jobs. 

Here's a concrete example: when mail enters the plant it is scanned by OCR machines. When the machine can't figure out the postal code by itself an image of the piece is sent to a room where a bunch of people are sitting at terminals. their job is to look at the image and enter the required information. Some people are really good at this and others literally type in anything because they don't want to be there (but have to be, which is another discussion altogether).

The only metric a supervisor has access to is overall shift performance in terms of speed and accuracy because the labour agreement has forced them to deactivate any features of the system which log individual productivity metrics for operators. There is no effective way to identify the individuals who need training or who type in anything.

That being said, overall, while universal healthcare doesn't provide the very best in all cases, it does seem to do as good a job on average of keeping people alive.  Life expectancies are just as good if not better in those countries (although there are many factors contributing to this).

So, other countries provide on average, as good care as the US at a much lower cost.  How do they do this?  Their drugs aren't as expensive, they don't over prescribe treatments that are only intended to cover the doctors ass from lawsuits.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","It sounds like you're in a really tough place, and that you might need something a bit more...effective? Specific? A lot of people will see improvements if they see a therapist they like, almost regardless of what kind of therapy it is, especially if the things they're going through are relatively commonplace (generalized anxiety, depression, etc.). But when someone's been through the sort of things you have, sometimes it takes more than the whole ""sitting on the couch, working through unconscious processes and things that have happened in your past"" approach (which is called the ""psychodynamic"" approach). There are other types of therapy which have been shown to be more effective than that; unfortunately, most people wouldn't know about them unless they're active in the field of psychology. So if you go to see any old therapist, you may not be getting the kind of treatment that's most helpful for your situation, but you have no way of knowing.

Having you ever heard of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)? It's a kind of therapy used to treat Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which is a very severe disorder that's basically centered around a heavily unstable or fractured sense of self. People with BPD have a very high need for love or approval, they'll engage in a lot of self-destructive behaviors, and their sense of self (and identity) fluctuates very wildly. They were typically seen as very hard to treat; conventional therapies didn't work for them. What DBT does is use a number of different techniques to help create mindfulness (an awareness of one's own cognitive and emotional processes) and help to both accept and regulate those emotions. While I don't think you have borderline personality disorder, it does sound like a lot of what you're going through is an unstable sense of self. DBT wouldn't necessarily help with the PTSD specific symptoms (fear, nightmares), but it could help you build up self-esteem and a stable identity, which could help you handle the other things you're going through. It's something to look into, and see if it sounds like something you might be open to.

Of course, if you do look for that kind of therapy, you want it to be with someone you feel comfortable with, and someone who you think you could be open to about what's really going on in your mind. This is 1) important, and 2) hard, because for a lot of people (myself included), it can be really easy to talk to just about anyone in therapy, but really hard to feel 100% comfortable. Before even seeing a specific therapist, I'd look around and see what you can find out about him or her. If they have even a paragraph or two that they've written about themselves and their practice, that can help you judge whether they sound like someone you'd be comfortable with. It's strange to say, but...be quick to judge, and be quick to reject someone. You'll want to feel better about whoever you end up seeing than you did about any of the three therapists you'd had before; if you're not more confident in the therapist, then it's hard to be more confident in the therapy as a whole, and that can keep it from working as well for you as it could otherwise.

Sorry that this was kind of long; hopefully some of the information in here will be helpful to you. Good luck, and stay strong; you really do sound like a very mature and resilient person. It's just a matter of finding a therapist who you can trust and work well with, who also has an approach or orientation that's well-suited to your particular situation (I feel that DBT would be the right approach for you, but someone else, yourself included, may have a different opinion, and that's totally okay). *Hugs* Hang in there.","1306888938"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are actually some pretty good reasons for this in women's clothing, even if that doesn't make it any less frustrating. My favorite explanation comes from Fashion Incubator's series on [Why women's clothing can't be sized like men's](http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/why-isnt-womens-clothing-sized-like-mens/). I also really like her suggestion for a labelling solution in [Part 2](http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/why-isn%E2%80%99t-women%E2%80%99s-clothing-sized-like-men%E2%80%99s-pt-2/).

Mathematically, men need 2 measurements on clothes (waist and inseam), so they have n^2 possible types of clothes. (If you have 5 different waist sizes and 5 different pant sizes, you'd need 5x5 or 25 total different sizes to fit all possible waist/inseam combinations).

Women need **3** measurements on clothing (waist, hip and inseam), so they would have to have n^3 different sizes to fit all combinations. For only 5 different hip, waist and inseam measurements you'd need 125 different sizes. Since manufacturers aren't going to make 125 different sizes for each different item of clothing they make (and, in fact, the number would be much larger because there is a much more than 5-inch variation in women's sizes), they have to try to figure out what the ""average"" size of their specific demographic is. Since, for example, the target demographic of Talbot's probably has a very different target demographic than Express, their ""average woman"" has a very different figure. Right now it's hard to make sizing that makes sense.


The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/business/25sizing.html?_r=1) also recently did an article on this exact issue with a really cool [graphic](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2011/04/24/business/20110425_SIZE_graphic.html?ref=business) that shows the size variations in a size 8 alone.

As it stands, you don't know the final pressure and temperature.  That is 2 unknowns.  That suggests that you only really need 2 independent equations to solve for pressure and temp.  Well, you have the Peng-Robinson and the enthalpy differntial equation ( dH = dU + d(PV) ).  Between the 2, you should be able to differentiate Peng-Robinson to get terms of (dP vs dT), (dP vs dV), or (dV vs dT) and substitute in to the enthalpy equation and solve for the missing variable.

Note, I haven't tried to solve it this way and it might be a huge dead end.  But it sounds pretty at least.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I know Kansas law, where one of these new laws was passed.  You do not have to prove citizenship to get a DL or state ID card.  If you are a foreign national you only need a passport from your country to get an ID and not be planning on leaving within 60 days, a work visa or a couple of other options.  Also, Kansas doesn't issue free ID cards.

Again in my other comments I said I don't necessarily have a problem with proving identity at the polling place, but I would prefer that you could use your social security number to verify your ID as you could when you registered to vote.

My main issue is with the new requirement when registering to vote that requires you to provide a copy of a birth certificate or other document that proves citizenship.  Proving citizenship was already done through providing part of your social security number so that the election office could verify your identity.  This new requirement is claimed to be aimed at stopping illegal immigrants, but there aren't any illegals voting.  This will hurt students and registration drives the most.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","The bottom line here is you made some huge sacrifices to be with someone who pushed you away. The biggest lesson you can take away from this is to be more cautious about allowing romance to interfere with your logic. It's tough though, because love and lust make us irrational. It's absolutely possible to do without hardening your heart. Be more careful about who you let into your life.

You started birth control for him. You took red-eye bus to see him even after you were laid off. But did you tell him you were going to do any of this for him, or did you just go through with it because of how you felt? Did you make these sacrifices because you wanted to please him?

When you're not meeting someone face-to-face, you get a different impression of them. You don't see their quirks, their body language, or bad habits. Their reactions are more raw and your interactions are more personal.

Jumping into sex never makes a situation any easier. My opinion (which differs from many, I'm sure) is that sex should be shared between two people who love and trust each other, and it should be used to show that they care for each other. Everyone is entitled to feel how they want about sex, I've found that this has saved me many times from making situations worse than they'd be otherwise.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I work at an upscale sports bar, in a busy, affluent suburb of DC. I worked a few jobs in high school and college as a waitress, and realized that bartenders make twice as much. I worked for a year at a DC nightclub, and after a year at a professional job, went back to it and was hired at the bar I work at now. At the nightclub, I was making the same salary as I am now, so the yearly salary I earn took no time at all. When I transitioned from the nightclub scene to the sports bar, although the business wasn't as crazy or hectic, I still ended up making the same amount of money. 

My drink advice is this: don't ever order a girl something without asking what she likes first... and just because it's expensive, doesn't mean she'll be impressed. Guys at the bar buy girls shots of Patron all the time, and they usually end up getting poured out.

If she likes bourbon, try a Caramel Apple, a new twist on the standard Washington Apple shooter: 1 oz. Crown Royale, 1/2 oz. Apple Pucker, 1/2 oz. Butterscotch Schnapps, cranberry juice.

If she wants something that's not too sweet, order a Raspberry Kamikaze: equal parts raspberry vodka, Triple Sec, and lime juice.

If she wants something where she can't taste the alcohol, ask for a White Gummy Bear: 1 oz. raspberry vodka, 1/2 oz. peach schnapps, dash of sour mix, Sprite.

(Any of those can also be made as a drink.) 

If you're trying to get her drunk on a budget, and she likes fruity drinks that pack a punch, try a Rum Runner... it's the alcohol-equivalent of a Long Island Iced Tea, but usually cheaper, and it's rare that anyone can drink more than 2 or 3. (1 oz. light rum, 1 oz. dark rum, 1 oz. Malibu rum, pineapple juice, orange juice, dash of grenadine, floater of Bacardi 151).","1306888984"

All I mean to say is that animals AND humans get more value based on how others view them.
People would care more about a run over family dog than a stray that would die of rabies. I think the same goes for humans. 
The value of a being, to me at least, is what it contributes to society: emotionally, functionally, or whatever else it can do.

So a mentally retarded person with no family would be put in an institution, right? I sometimes drive my grandfather to see his friend who has Alzheimers. There are many patients there living terrible lives. Virtually no one visits them and they have no real rights or privileges. They can't walk around by themselves, feed themselves or wash themselves.

"politics","t5_2cneq","No, the point being that I was trying to make is that with as scarce as knowledge is for the particular field, he was not in a position where he needed to negotiate for anything lower, as while pickings might be slightly slimmer, they aren't exactly impossible to find (heck, he mentioned doing a contract for $50/hour in his last contract). However, he didn't mention whether or not the company actually got what they wanted yet or not. Just that 3 months later, the kid they hired was still working on it (however, progress on it wasn't mentioned, and which is understandable, as I would expect a NDA for the kid would have prevented him from talking about the details about it). So, they got what they paid for. Which is more or less what I was trying to get at.

I was also responding to this portion, instead of to him directly:

&gt; Especially when pickings are small and business is harder to get. What I've found that may encourage you, is that at the end of the day, time to fulfill a project specs will win. Hiring a cheap employee always sounds good when you don't know how to create something yourself. But as a business owner, it doesn't take long to figure out the mistake you've made.

We won't know for certain what exactly will happen on this, but making assumptions on how the kid hired for the job was fresh and inexperienced, it's most likely that at some point, the project will be canceled, it won't meet expectations after failing to meet its schedule, or they end up purchasing something instead, when they find that they can't wait for the project to finish.

I happen to be within the same field, so I can understand how such decisions, while they might seem to be rather simple at first, end up biting the employers in the long term, which frankyphillips also pointed out. And when someone's been once bitten by bad software, they generally are less willing to make the same sort of mistake a second time around.","1306889005"

It drives me nuts when sites try to do geolocation when serving up sites with different languages.

You should *default* to the language specified by the user's browser header, but always allow the user to change the preferred language and save this setting.

Keep in mind that *language* and *locale* are different. You should never assume that just because a user wants a page in a specific language, they also want the page served in a specific locale. For example, things like the formatting of dates, currency, numbers, etc. can be very different depending on locale and are somewhat independent of language. 

An easy to understand real-world example of differences in locales is US English vs UK English. They're both English, but there are lots of things that are different between the 2 locales that can sometimes necessitate completely different choice of words based on the different locales.

For further reading, I suggest you read the W3C's article on this subject:

I like your single class idea, or if you want to have selectable characters, the idea from WirelessFlower for the 3 class system could work well! I'm assuming this will be a character based story, though, so that type of customization may not fit well with your game. 

Also something else I had thought of - since the concept of the show is about friendship, perhaps there is a way you could work that into your game? For example, if the friendship between two ponies (or more) is strong, then perhaps they could perform some sort of combined attack (for example, Rainbow Dash zips around an enemy causing them to dizzy, then Applejack comes in for a powerful takedown kick). The player could increase the friendship levels between ponies by performing small side quests for them, or through some sort of conversation wheel, a la Mass Effect.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","jumping with 3 is entirely possible, and sometimes a good plan.  I learned it on Badwater.  Playing offence, a demo can put 3 stickies at the gate and jump-detonate a little bit away from the stickies, leaving you with about 15 hp as you fly.  I'll then airstrafe to the roof that RED always puts sentreis on, land on the healthpack to survive, and stickyspam the sentries.  

If you wanna learn how to do it, try detonating the stickies at different times and you jump past them.  Badwater is good to learn because there's the rail right outside the gate, which is useful for learning the timing.  First detonate at the first rail, then the second, etc. until you get it.","1306889058"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sorry, I was in the country for a few days with no internet. I completely forgot about asking, so I left a FB message last night before bed and got the message earlier... Dubai is a beautiful city, infused with rich modern western and Indian culture. It is perhaps, the most beautiful city I have been in. With regards to living and teaching here, it would no longer be my first choice. If you are looking for a short term experience than I would say give it a try, however, if you are looking for a several year commitment then a place like South Korea or Beijing would be a better bet. Currently, the market for English teachers here is very competitive and does not pay the greatest... 1 bedroom apartments typically cost upwards of 50,000 per year alone.. My best advice is to shop around.. Look at every possible employer and try to figure out a good deal. If you have experience teaching English overseas, you could negotiate a very good deal for yourself. Some placed will happily pay for your living arrangements in-order to bring  you on as a teacher.

IIRC, they determined that women and men were equally into the idea of casual sex when you control for their judgement of how good it's likely to be. The confound in the ""random stranger propositions you"" argument is that it gives a different impression to men from the impression it gives to women.

I remember people always commenting about how much autotune there is on the show, and I never realized/noticed it until recently. I already know Matt Morrison has a good voice (otherwise he wouldn't be on Broadway) so I was really confused when I noticed that when he got up onstage to sing that solo in the finale, the song was autotuned.

I don't use it because it doesn't have optical ins/outs, just spdif. However, it is well known that MOTU gear doesn't always play nice with PC's. If you're a Mac user I'd recommend stepping up to the MOTU 828-mk3. If there's anything you should put more money into it's your audio interface and your monitors. Go for the gold and get the 828. It's only a couple hundred dollars more and if you find a used one it's usually the same price as a new Ultralite.

Also, they (MOTU interfaces) have DC-coupled outs, so if you wanted to send CV signals to analog gear from your computer using a program like Volta or the Expert Sleepers plugins, you could do that as well. This obviates the need for a midi-cv converter, but it's perhaps not as flexible. Still, it's a nice feature that MOTU interfaces have which many other companies don't offer.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Hanover, NH - right on the Border with Vermont - about 1/2 way up the state. I go to college up here, but, I'm originally from just South of Boston so my wardrobe doesn't change too much.

9 out of 12 months of the year, it's cold as shit up here. I go to a rural campus, literally - the Wal-Mart in the next town is one of the big attractions, and we are surrounded by woodlands. Personally, I love it, and have adopted a very ""outdoorsy"", ""outing club"", ""faux-mil"" style. In the winter and cold months (ie. always) - it's M72 Swiss wool dress pants, a wicking poly undershirt, and nice thick CK sweaters (generally autumnal patterns, but, more iron grey and navy blue in the depths of winter). The goal in the cold months is practicality - NOT fashion. Half of the stuff out here would look simply ridiculous when it's -25F outside with windchill. Most of campus turns into multicoloured North Face marshmallows around this time. Stable Footwear is an absolute must. I know MFA gets a bit snooty at Merrels, but, considering I wear 9"" water-proof snowshoeing boots for months at a time (without socks no less), I think that fashion has to take a backseat to practicality: if the town hasn't plowed out campus, you'll have to get through 3' or 4' of snow just to get to your classes.

That makes these few warm months, only within the past 3 weeks it's been warm around here, so interesting. I drop from wool long pants to lighter (color and material) khakis and eventually I've started wearing khaki short-shorts (about 3"" above the knee). I tan quite easily so, the affront of pasty white legs is missing, but, it's still a bit of a statement. I try to wear nice button down shirts and am absolutely in love with my national costume: Guyabera, khakis, and dress shoes. As it is, I'll wear more mobile boots with the outfit unless I'm going to something where I won't have to move around campus.

This is overall a very good thing, as it gives us faster programs.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The funniness is the situations, you're kind of supposed to see past the comic and read the story, but you can't read the story if you don't understand the comic.  Its a hard thing to explain.  Think of the rage faces as being a simple pictographic language in themselves, a particular face communicates more then the words themselves do.  So in reading one, you have to read the situation and at the same time translate the meaning of the faces and overlap them together.  Sometimes the meaning of the words and the meaning of the faces are in conflict, creating humor, or sometimes the underlying situation itself is funny but only fully comprehendable if you consider the translation of the meanings of the faces.

Now.. full disclosure..! I don't particularly find most rage comics funny either..! (I do some!) But I do understand why they are funny.  I think they are really interesting; being a nerd and an academic, I think rage comics are an academic curiosity in shared culture and linguistics.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you're in the front, it seems like you're half way down before you even pick up speed. 

Also, I found this during a quick google search. Interesting:

""To understand how this works, imagine a coaster train reaching the top of a hill. As it ascends, it slows down because gravity is pulling on it from behind. But when the first car makes it over the apex, gravity starts pulling that car down the other side of the hill. Because of gravity's pull, the first car starts to accelerate, which accelerates the second car, which accelerates the third car and so on. In this way, all of the rear cars are accelerated by the motion of the first car, so they all start accelerating at different points along the track. By the time the last car moves over the hump, gravity has already accelerated the first car a good bit. Consequently, the rear car will have a higher acceleration at the top of the hill than the first car did. This increased force essentially whips the car over the top, briefly pushing up on the riders so that they almost fly out of their seats.

For many people, this is the best spot on a roller coaster throughout the ride because all the twists and turns are more pronounced. But in most coasters, you can't see the track very well from the rear car: Your line of sight is blocked by the people in front of you. The visual component of the roller-coaster ride is important because it gives you a sense of speed and peril -- coaster designers intentionally weave the track around all sorts of obstacles to make you feel like the ride is out of control. In a typical coaster design, the riders in the front car get an unobstructed view of all these obstacles whipping past them. In a coaster that has seats facing backward, the rear car offers the best of both worlds -- you get a great view and the most intense ride.

The best seat on a coaster, then, is a matter of personal taste. If you love the feeling of weightlessness, head for the back. If you want the best view of the action, head for the front.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It appears that neither your basic physics nor your ""ride specialist"" training covered basic concerns of momentum, then.  While you're correct that all cars move at the same speed and that the ""faster"" comment is silly, there is a significant difference between the front and the back.  The front car crests a hill at the slowest possible speed, while the back car crests each hill at the fastest.  This means that your body's momentum, trying to keep you going in a straight line, will experience more intense effects from the change of direction, which intensifies that ""negative gravity"" feeling.  A lot of people swear by the back car because they love the so-called ""hang time"".","1306889135"

There's almost always a group of people gaming in some fashion at any given moment—whether TF2, Left For Dead, Eve, RIFT, StarCraft, or crappy flash versions of Pictionary and Apples to Apples.

"climbing","t5_2qk72","I would try washing with something that kills bacteria such as lysol but I've tried this and it doesn't work too well. I also froze them and that doesn't do much either. I once tried saturating it in rubbing alochol but that seriously took the color off and made everything blue. 

What I've found to work the best is to wash the shoe by hand and then use some kind of foot powder after every day of climbing. I keep dr scholls in a tiny medicine zip lock bag that I use to pour some into the shoe and then tap the shoes together to disperse it.
You should also let the shoe air out but not in direct sun. The foot powder also helps to keep your foot dry the next time you climb.

Also if your shoe is a bit loose, you can also wear athletic type socks to keep the inside of your shoe clean and your foot clean. The upside of this is you don't have to scrub your feet after climbing. Do not wear socks in your ""good"" pair of shoes because it will stretch it out. I have cheapo pair of shoes that are loose and I don't mind stretching them out and it also is very comfortable for walking around outdoors. Some people may say that you are a noob for wearing socks just to let you know. Personally I wear my junk shoes outdoors with socks all the time because its super comfortable and I can switch into my regular shoes easily because I have socks on and my climbing shoes don't stink too bad","1306889163"

- Queen vomit puts warpgates to shame. (And allows you to remax your army epicly fast in the endgame)
- Mules are the dumbest looking unit in the game. That's legitimately the only reason I don't play terran. I refuse to use mules.

The car I hit was a rental that does care about the car and there was paint damage (sad day). The person I hit definitely seemed like an honest very friendly person and I still have her information, I think she'd vouch for me if I needed it. This lady was on a business trip and the circumstances required her to call for an accident report so that it wouldn't come back to cost her a bunch of many. I was in support of this since this person was very nice and it definitely wasn't her fault. The rental company has a separate company who owns all the cars by the name of PurCo and they have sent me a bill for the damages of $1345 covering parts, labor, loss of use, and administrative fees. The main issue I'm worried about is whether I should pay the bill or some part of it and hope that my premium doesn't go up anyway or just let my insurance company handle it and deal with the premium spike.

With regard to efficiency, steel wheels on steel rails is the most efficient. Human-powered pedal machines with steel wheels on rails are the best way to minimize rolling resistance. A great deal can be done, with enclosed cockpits in e.g. teardrop shapes, to reduce wind resistance, even when using rubber tires. Rubber tires are the best for normal roads because with steel one would hop over every bump, with energy lost to vertical motion. With rubber, there is a very nice regain of energy as the rubber restores itself after deforming over the bump. If I recall correctly, the book states that the human body can convert only about 1/3rd of its calories into motion. The book states that bicycles are ""near optimum"".

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","So I tested this out and I know exactly why it happens.

The system believes a zergling costs 25 (true) and a baneling costs 50 plus a zergling (also true). When you make two zerglings, the spending correctly shows 50. When you morph one, the spending shows 100 because technically you haven't spent the zergling yet, you can still back out. Once the zergling morphs, the system tries to add the zergling whose value is 25 to the spending as you've now spent it. The problem is that it is counting the 25 minerals that zergling cost twice. So despite the fact that you've only spent 100 resources, it says 125.

After the baneling is made, for whatever reason the system maintains that a zergling costs 25 and a baneling costs 50. Which results in misleading army/units lost tabs.

They could fix the spending tab by preventing the system from including the cost of the unit as 'spent' during morphing. Or they could fix the Army/Units Lost by changing the value of banelings to 75. But either way morphing units are going to be when it comes to the values displayed.

The only real solution I can think of is to assume the value of a baneling is (the total creation value), but for the purposes of the spending tab they need to subtract the value of the unit it morphs from so that it doesn't add the value twice.","1306889246"

"skyrim","t5_2s837","There was a Morrowind mod (combat enhanced maybe?) that made it so you could swing your weapon several different ways; moving left or right while attacking would cause a horizontal slash motion, moving forward or back would result in a stabbing motion, and standing still would just be a regular chop. Each weapon type had varying yet appropriate damage for each type of attack. 

Maybe you can see where I'm going with this. If they puts spears in the game, you could chop-attack with it, but it wouldn't be very effective. Unless you had a halberd or something, running and stabbing would cause the most damage.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I think an infinitesimal leap of faith is necessary to escape solipsism.  In the same sense that we cannot directly experience cause and effect relationships, but through data and experimentation we can posit a pattern.  Of course, gravity is never proven in the sense that everything could still fall apart as we know it tomorrow (there's an infinitentially small chance that the relationship is coincidental), but through induction we've found it to be reliably true.  Here we see that just because you cannot deduce something doesn't make it untrue.  All a solipsist is really saying is that I cannot deduce the existence of other consciousness, therefore I can't believe that other people are out there, but once again, that's a poor argument since you also cannot deduce there are *not* people out there.  It's like a blind person denying the existence of color because it's something they can't experience.  You haven't the tools to verify it other than through induction.  Induction tells us that people out there act like us, feel similarly in similar situations, and possess knowledge, memories, and motive independent from your own.  

It may be a leap of faith that the induction is properly displaying the relational connection between your consciousness and how you act, and how they act, but it's a bigger leap of faith still to assume that they don't exist.  If you don't have the tools to deduce it directly from raw experience, you must go with induction.","1306889256"

This happened way back in the 80s. GF and I were on the way home from the beach, with her friend and the friend's 2 little kids lying asleep next to her on the bench seat in back. About 2am I got to a yellow light. At first I was going to roll through it, changed my mind and started to step on the brake, then changed my mind again to avoid spilling the 2 kids onto the floor by stopping too abruptly (old bus, no seat belts in back). By now I was way the hell too late and I rolled through the red light. It was bar closing time and there was an unusual amount of traffic around. Everything suddenly lit up as a cop several cars behind me turned his flashers on. He tried to maneuver around traffic, but the other cars had stopped for the light and wouldn't budge to let him out.  

I was very familiar with that intersection and knew it was a long light with left-turn lights in all directions, so I knew I had some time. I drove carefully to the next corner, deliberately not hurrying so it would look like I was clueless rather than fleeing. Made a full legal stop at a stop sign and turned. As soon as I got around the corner and was out of sight of the cop I floored my trusty bus for all it was worth. Turned into a housing tract, made a couple more turns, parked behind a big van in front of a house and shut everything down. We sat and listened to music for about 15 minutes before I drove the ladies the rest of the way home, no problem. 

Not exactly Dukes of Hazzard, but pretty cool to elude the law in a 20-year-old hippy-wagon. In reality the cop probably said screw it by the time the traffic light changed.

Not to mention that it makes the prints we're looking at relatively anonymous. We get prints of criminals and prints of people who are not - people applying for certain jobs that require background checks. The likelihood of the prints of someone you know coming across your screen is pretty high.

Oh, not to mention shoving information into a database that is extraneous to the job that needs to be done does nothing but slow down *everything*.

Ron Paul has some positions that are most unpopular amongst his peers, some of which he holds unapologetically.  I applaud him for that.  He comes with some positions which I'm not entirely sure I support, or which I reluctantly support (such as transferring the power to legislate marriage to the states)... but I'm far less worried about him usurping the White House in the name of Theocracy or the Police State than I am of any Republican or Democrat.

Republicans do a terrible job at convincing people that they're open-minded and for individual freedom, so when they stab you in the back, it isn't all that terribly surprising.  Democrats, however, do a great job at it... which makes it all the more painful when you see Al Franken standing behind the knife in your back.

Some newer games would not be maxed out with a 6950. 2 6850s in CF would still perform much better if you are trying to stick to that price range and get the most out of your money/stay future proof.

A single card would be simpler and more energy efficient than using two cards in cross fire, but at the ~$300 price range you'll get more bang for your buck with two cards in cross fire. With that being said, if you want to spend less, a factory overclocked 560 ti outperforms a 6950 and usually will cost you less. ","1306889303"

quote where i did so, i think your on the edge of liable there ;)

i dismissed nothing, so there no argument to be had. i actually agree that there is a lot of atheists over here, and i also agree many are annoying.  so its not addressing it because i am dismissing it, ( a charge you only so happily paint me with) but because there was no real argument made over his point, because i don't disagree with it. 

I hoped share some perspective to him, hoping maybe he'd see what it was like for every other person around here that isn't a christian. 

tldr:

what you are accusing me of:

Illegitimate use of tu quoque

listed example on wiki: ""He cannot accuse me of libel because he was just successfully sued for libel.""

What actually happened:

told brenwolf that the annoying feeling he has about that is what everyone else who is not christian feels about things far more dire than the internet.

I made no dismissal, i was pointing out thats the reality for everyone else.  I see no way to accuse someone of an argument fallacy when no real argument was being made. last time i checked pointing out the overlooked obvious is not a fallacy. but of course you will think as you will.

How about all those nice Ethiopians turned down by Italian offices as they arrived in boat loads. Not wanted here!

Lets also mention Albanians and Georgians wanting to live and work in Russia. They can expect problems for sure. 

The UK has such a high influx of foreigners, luckily some of these make up for the local work force. However it was a huge deciding factor in allowing Romania to join the EU. As a result a great deal of EU states feel like the ""2nd division"" IE: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania.

TL;DR at bottom, whole thing is a good read for anyone who feels 'dumb on finance'.

I agree, I get that some people struggle to make ends meet on minimum wage let alone put aside 10% of their paycheque and I don't want to go into socio-economic factors behind poverty because i think i'd be out of my depth pretty quickly.

In reality, wealth returning assets for people living on or below the poverty line are very different to you or me, the average joe. You can go to work and save $5k and put it in a managed fund and earn a return never having done anything but work and save. Do this your entire life and still you are likely to die only slightly above your station (now upper middle class) - but you will have drawn an income or an increase in your wealth from that investment in the asset.

Someone living below the poverty line isn't going to buy shares or a rental property, or numerous other assets unless they have the cash.

For them a wealth returning (saving) asset is more likely to be one that either a) lowers a current cost (food-garden, bus fare-car rent-buy house) or b) is a secondary income (sell your 'tomatoes', repair things for cash with skills you learnt in a course, etc).

Poverty sucks and being poor (just getting by) sucks. The reason finance is at the top of this thread is likely because people who understand the scope of it get why some people remain in poverty for generations. I suggest reading or listening to the podcasts of [1] freakonomics for interesting realworld economic examples from drugs to hookers to donuts.

To illustrate one concept, the power of compounding:

I make $100 a year. I save $1 a year and invest it in the bank for 50 years. At year 50, that $1 is now worth $117.39 given a 10% per year compounding interest. Add together all the interest and added dollars for all the years (1-50) and you have $1280.30 for your actual outlay of $50 real dollar bills over 50 years.
NOW, take that money from your generation and give it to your children to invest for a further 50 years and you have $151,458.42. (please note i'm ignoring all sorts of other things like consumer price index/inflation/etc actually i'll touch on inflation)

So as you can see, that small amount of saving (whilst it may seem a large % of your paycheque) at the time grows exponentially by compounding on each years returns. If however you don't save that 10% of your pay to put aside to invest in an asset that won't instantly lose you money (a brand new car loses $1000's the moment it drives off the lot, a used car less so.) like say a brand new iphone you don't get that money, you get nothing but your iphone and iphones don't buy houses and food and lifestyles.

Inflation/debt

Now apply that same concept to the price of goods/the value of your money - A $1 apple rises in price at 3%p.a. - A wealth returning asset for someone who is struggling to pay for the rising cost of groceries can earn a (saving) of $1 for every apple they don't have to pay for by eating them from their garden and still have that $1 (assuming it was going to be spent on apples) to invest.

Similarly if you have credit card debt, you are now paying $500 compounding daily (interest is accrued daily and then that interest if still there tomorrow is charged interest on interest) at an effective rate generally around 20%p.a. The bank will forever let you pay out to just cover the interest of your debt and maintain that 'maxxed out card' because it is ""free money"".

I'm not sure if i answered what you were looking for a lot of this is geared at someone who quite literally has near no knowledge of basic finance

TL;DR

Compounding (interest) Returns turns your 10% payday savings into much more when you withdraw it and that amount on withdrawal will be much larger if you invest now rather than 1yr from now. People living on or below the poverty line usually struggle to balance their income against their expenses (interest/bills/food/drugs/whatever) and don't invest because of living on the poverty line coupled with poor knowledge of financing being a barrier to 'getting into it'. Those who save and invest become richer while the poor remain poor.

TL;DR, TL;DR

Save $1 and invest it at $1x((1+(%interest paid to you by bank)) ^\ number of years invested) = $$ @10yrs = $$$ @11yrs = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ @50 yrs.","1306889342"

Why is it that you can brutalize a chicken. How far down the scale have they gone that warrants that? How far down does a thing need to go down the scale to be treated like that.

No seriously, You've got it wrong. I'm not a liar. Recognising that you might be wrong is the first step to correcting what you do have wrong. It is at least truth that everybody could be wrong about something. Anybody who says there is no chance they are wrong *are* wrong in at least that. 

Also, you shouldn't listen to people as a method to discover truth, at least not if you have to rely on their personal experiences to do so. You shouldn't take anybody at their word. However, accepting a valid argument is fine, because it's verifiable by your own mind.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","This actually comes down to the idea of the definition of ""God"" in itself. Let's take the Big Bang for example. The idea and evidence points to the existence of a point in time of ""Creation"" per se, but when all atoms in the universe were differentiated, isotopes created, all mass created at this point in time. Before that, time did not exist, nor did atoms, nor do we really know anything about ""before"" the big bang, because asking what came ""before"" time is not rationally sound.  This is all accepted in the scientific community. 

Then, take the Sunni Muslim notion of God. Essentially, boiled down to its most basic tenet, is that we believe there was a first cause. Atheists and scientists have essentially already accepted the notion that there was a first cause. Scientists have effectively proved there was a first cause - that model won out over the Eternal universe model among the scientific community. This is sunni muslim belief. 

Now, saying that we have ""shunted"" the truth by simply accepting there was a first cause before proof is silly. Even scientists accepted this notion before they could prove it, or had the instruments to show it. They just simply conjectured rationally that there must have been a Big Bang. Muslims accept the notion of a first cause from rationality (one source of truth) and Science accepts the notion of a first cause from empiricism (another valid source of truth). 

If anything, accepting that the Big Bang occurred is, according to your criteria, a valid reason for believing (nay, knowing it as truth) in a First Cause.  Now, since the first cause has been proved rationally as well as empirically, other characteristics of God are based on other rational proofs, but I believe that science will vindicate Islam in these respects as well. Just not sure how, just like many early scientists before there time.

I made my own choice to stop taking my medication after a year, and I wasn't depressed then, and no one considered me depressed either. My family never knew I stopped taking them until years later.

I would say they misdiagnosed me - symptoms are symptoms, not 100% causes. Plus, if you look through the DSM IV you will see many different 'problems' share many of the same 'symptoms'.

In my case, I got in trouble with the law because I was hanging out with the wrong people, went from having straight A's and perfect attendance in school to getting mostly C's and B's. Why is this? Because school was pointless, I realized it was a waste of my time, and I was far more interested in other things. I ended up graduating high school with a 3.5 GPA without doing most of my homework, and without attending quite a few classes.

So these 'warning signs' of depression were in reality me learning and understanding the world, choosing what I believed was right and, honestly, being a teenager.","1306889369"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Actually, the hedonic, or opponent-process, theory of addiction has been quite firmly refuted. It 100% does not explain why people continue to use drugs when there is significant harm associated with it (rats will continue to administer cocaine, even when it is paired with an electrical shock). There is something else going with addiction that is both psychological and physiological, as seen in research done by Josh Berke, Robinson, and Berridge. Marijuana may not cause the harm that drugs like heroin, alcohol, and prescription opiods can; however, it does still have SOME negative consequences for the user and there are people who will continue to use it, even when it starts to affect their personal lives which, according to the DMS, is part of the criteria. I'm not claiming to know everything, or even a fraction of a percent of what is known about addiction but I can tell you that Marijuana can be addictive, just like anything else, and that this addiction can manifest itself in many ways.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Electrons are responsible for the energy difference. Later, some more on how to do the calculation.

The universe becomes optically thin to neutrinos at a bit before 1 second, if I remember correctly. From that point forward, neutrinos basically just had fixed energies, except for redshifting due to cosmological expansion (once in a while the odd neutrino scatters off of something, but this is not important).

Usually, you need lots of interactions to set up a thermal equilibrium and give you a blackbody spectrum. However, it is something of a coincidence that if you start with a blackbody distribution of energies and then redshift each of the individual frequencies (taking into account the number density decreasing at the same time), you again end up with a blackbody distribution! This is true both for neutrinos and photons.

That's why the CMB is such a good blackbody, you see -- it's not currently interacting with much (since the universe is optically thin), so nothing is *keeping* it in thermal equilibrium. It just transforms from a blackbody to another blackbody because of how the math works out.

So, back to the early universe. Neutrinos ""froze out"", but they kept the same blackbody distribution they had (except for redshifting the whole while). If that was all that happened, you would see the neutrinos and photons with the same temperature as one another today.

However, very soon after the neutrinos froze out, another interaction froze out. This interaction is
e^+ + e^- &lt;--&gt; 2 photons.
The forward reaction was allowed to proceed any time an electron met a positron. However, there were not nearly enough high energy photons for the backward reaction to happen (just because the universe was expanding and cooling). All the entropy[1] from the electrons and positrons ended up as photons. This effectively heated the photon temperature.

This is why the photons are now hotter than the neutrinos.


[1] It is entropy which is conserved, since the expansion of the universe is adiabatic. The expansion is adiabatic since the Hubble time is long compared to the thermalization time of one of these fluids of electrons and photons.

The conservation of entropy actually allows you to calculate the ratio of the neutrino temperature to photon temperature pretty simply. You just need to know that the entropy density of a fluid is proportional to T^3, times a degeneracy parameter which varies from particle to particle depending on whether it's a fermion or boson (fermions have an extra factor), and how many species there are (e.g. there are three type of neutrinos times 2 for particles and antiparticles, but there is just 1 type of electron times 2 for antiparticles). The entropy is the entropy density times volume, so that is proportional to sum(g_i (a T_i)^3) where a is the scale factor and g_i is the degeneracy factor of particle i. Then it's just a bit of math!

P.S. Temperature follows a very simple law in a cosmological spacetime. The product aT is constant, unless one of these freezeouts occurs that heats a species.","1306889391"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;If you goal is to have a savings account then do you really need to spend them? 

Isn't that the point of a currency? Right now people are not thinking about Bitcoin as a medium of transfer and are just looking at them as stores of value that are appreciating. The appreciation of BC is dependent on new people demanding the coins, however those people are not likely to view the currency as a medium of transfer either. As it stands there is a very limited economy for BitCoins which, IMO, is unlikely to grow quickly because the majority of bitcoins ""users"" are interested in holding onto their coins (for appreciation) rather than spending them.

At some point the influx of new users will slow (because BC is unlikely to transcend a small niche of users) and appreciation will drop. At this point people will be more incentivized to spend (because they aren't forgoing so much future value). However, if an infrastructure to trade the coins hasn't been built up, you're likely to see an outflow from BC that will devalue the currency completely. 

This is all just conjecture. If a real economy were to form (beyond the developer for hire stuff that currently exists) the currency could survive. However I think it's unlikely to happen given the inherent deflation the currency exhibits.","1306889400"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","You know, I dislike using suffering as the reason to grant certain protections to animals. I wont call them rights because my opinion is that rights come with responsibilities; that is to respect the rights of other organisms with rights. Obviously that's not going to happen with non-human animals, so call them protected, because that's really what we're talking about. Protecting the life of animals from human beings.

Now, I don't think the line should be drawn with the ability to suffer. Sure, it's a noble goal to prevent suffering, but I don't think it makes a meaningful difference in the world to prevent suffering. That is what we want to do right? Modify human behavior to be less destructive towards our planet-mates. With that goal in mind, a strategy of respecting living things regardless of their ""status"" is the only effective option.

Let's be clear here. To a non-biologist, and to many biologists even, there isn't a clear distinction between animals and non-animals. The ability to suffer is not the scientific classification of metazoans. I am familiar with the distinctions as well as the diversity of non-metazoan protists that display characteristics a non-biologist might consider animal-like. 

I don't think metazoans or the macroscopic animals have any characteristic that makes them deserving of special protection over the non-metazoans or the microscopic organisms. Instead, all organisms deserve to be permitted to live their life without unnecessary human intervention.

What does this mean? We need to be stewards of the planet, not just of ourselves, nor ourselves and dolphins, apes, and dogs. We use ecosystems for short term gain, and all the inhabitants suffer (in the metaphorical sense). The former forest tribes, the endangered great apes, the flying squirrels, the trees and herbs, the algae and protists, and the bacteria and viruses. The environment that supported a whole network of life now asymptotically supports human economic development.

The only way to protect all living things is to have human economic development be commensal with healthy ecosystems, which can only exist when the inhabitants can live out a normal life. ","1306889420"

That said, there's a trend in the States to milk the ever-loving shit out of anything that will make a person/corporation (one in the same now, right?) money. It's the reason shows like The Office or Will and Grace drag on for five+ seasons past their prime. Not that those shows depreciate in quality necessarily, but after a while the formula gets old, stale, boring. If you look at series in other countries, they'll often have only two season (The Office UK comes to mind) so that the show remains forever loved and forever fresh. While I love AD, by the third season it began to fade. I think it ended at absolutely the perfect time. 

It goes without saying, however, that studios couldn't care less about the legacy of their programming: it's all about dat $$, and AD had likely dropped significantly in the ratings and was no longer ""financially viable,"" or whatever horseshit drivel those assholes try to make us believe.

"programming","t5_2fwo","In practice, yeah, while the IL is much easier to translate, there are a lot of optimization opportunities I miss out on, and some that end up being much harder.

For one example, if you try to write to a multidimensional array of structs in C#, the generated MSIL roughly translates to this:

    Struct&amp; temporaryReference = &amp;array.Get(y, x);
    temporaryReference = new Struct(...)

Yes, that's taking a reference to the return value of an arbitrary function. Yes, it's then writing into the reference. No, this doesn't really make any sense. It works, though!

The correct code for that would just be:
    array.Set(y, x, new Struct(...))
But the semantics of value types in MSIL make that hard to express. The original C# is way easier to understand than the IL, and in practice, I still can't generate the 'right' code for that case without breaking other cases... right now it becomes:
    var temporaryReference = array.GetReference(y, x);
    temporaryReference.value = new Struct(...);
Which works, but is suboptimal.

Many more cases like that have cropped up, and my only real choice is to try and document them in a clear test case so it's less likely that I will break them without noticing.","1306889432"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","This is a job, if you worked as a salesman, and your shift is from 8-12 ( Idra trains 4 hours a day ) if some jerk then knows your time and knows when your free and comes in just to go on  a test drive to annoy you and waste time then you'd be mad. I think because a lot of the community play this as a game instead of a job they don't understand how frustrating this might be.

And while your saying this is only 9 minutes etc, but imagine if your stream sniped 6 times in a night each game last 20 minutes plus ( Destiny goes heavy spines, Idra very MACRO ) that's 1/2 of your work time gone. Idra has played the ROOT team so many times that playing them again will provide little knowledge to him.

Idra does gg, gl hf and even uses please. But this is just annoying. I mean thousands of people watch idra more than anyone he is kinda the face of NA starcraft, so beating him is a pride issue. You know what's really gm  on idra's part.

NEVER uploading a replay, I've never heard of IDRA uploading a replay of him stomping someone, yet you almost ALWAYS see a game with IDRA losing? Because some arrogant player just beat him and when 'lol lol lol, IDRA sucks. Watch me cheese him and prove how much he sucks' Idra even took a while to start streaming and even then I'm  sure it was for money.

Idra while he is BM doesn't like to show-off he says it how it is. Yes it's BM, but ask yourself WHY DO YOU KEEP WATCHING HIS STREAM?

IDRA is a fantastic player
The ROOT team are fantastic players

Stream sniping shoud stop it's just immature. Especially since they are either doing it so they can get so many extra matches against a player when they say 'I'll go 8 pool, see how IDRA reacts.' Just so in a tournament they'll have all the extra information. That's kinda cheating.","1306889443"
"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;&gt;Homosexual debate.

OK, your attempt at logical arguments are far from logical. Yes, one cannot procreate through the act of homosexual intercourse but given that last time I checked homosexuality accounts for roughly 2-3% of the population, we're not going to have any issues with the human race dying due to mass gayness. You say it should be frowned upon because it doesn't result in offspring but I really thing we, as a species, are welllll beyond worrying about such matters. Because of this, any disagreement with homosexuality on those grounds is *entirely* illogical. Don't confuse logical thinking with the assumption that we should follow natures 'design'. 

Logic dictates that we should aim for the most happiness for the most people. Homosexuality between consenting adults has no bearing on other people and so logically there's no sound reason to be against it. Your religion may say it's wrong, but we both live in free countries and your religion shouldn't dictate how others live their lives.

&gt;&gt;Science/proof/Dawkins video.

The reason for my position that God needs to be proven to exist - well it's simple. The onus on proof is on s/he who asserts it. That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. 

You (I assume) don't believe in Zeus, Ra, Odin, Thor or any number of the other mythical gods that people have believed in in the past. Why not? Also, why is faith a positive thing? Believing something to be true when there is simply 0 evidence for it? Again I point you to tarot cards, homoeopathy. Faith opens ones mind to believing that which has no evidence and that's a dangerous thing.

&gt;&gt;John Adams quote etc.

You say no one forces people to be Christian, that's great and that's as it should be. Unfortunately people are forced to follow religious dogma - homosexuals not being allowed to marry for example. I hate to break it to you but the concept of marriage is far *far* older than Christianity it does not belong to you guys. There are plenty of other cases like this. Stem cell research being blocked for so long on religious principles despite the fact that it has the potential to help *so* many people. You may not like it but the US was founded on secular principles, to ensure that religious tyranny would never take over again. However people seem to be willing to toss that aside so that their religion can take charge again. 

&gt;&gt;Love

Well, that's your opinion but I disagree. The brain is an *incredibly* complex organ and we have a long way to go until we understand it. Just because it seems so complex does not mean that it is, in any way, supernatural.

&gt;&gt;Agnostics.

I don't want to get all schoolground about this but it strikes me that religious folk would be far more afraid to let go of the baseless belief in a deity. It means we're on our own here. My position, as I've said, is that I lack belief in God. It cannot be disproved therefore I won't actively believe one doesn't exist, but I will hold it in the same position as other supernatural silliness. Stating one is too afraid to believe is a little silly - am I too afraid to believe in Neptune? Zeus? Are you?
You say agnostics want to believe in God - why on earth would I? Having an eternal parent in the sky that sees all, knows all and judges all you do? Sounds terrible - sounds like (not my term) a celestial North Korea...

I agree, people all over the shop have a warped idea of the bible. Would it surprise you to learn that statistically speaking, atheists know the bible better than Christians? A running joke in /r/atheism is that the best way to deconvert a Christian is to get them to read the bible in full.

Answer me one thing - why is the bible more relevant than the polytheistic Hinduism for example. That is to say a religion that is *entirely* separate from the three main Abrahamic religions. If you were born in India it's highly likely you'd be Hindu, Sikh or similar. China, perhaps Buddhist. It strikes me as so obvious that one is born in to a religion and then after decades of indoctrination is convinced that theirs must be the correct one. Doesn't that seem a little silly? 


edit: Fair enough on your beliefs about abortion &amp; the death penalty. I admire that at least you're consistent in that respect. I disagree with the death penalty for logical reasons. It's more expensive than putting people in prison for life (if you allow for fair trials and appeals, as clearly you should when a persons life is at stake). Also, it has been shown to not be a deterrent. Abortion is more tricky, though I did read an article where a woman nearly died because of complications 5 months in to the pregnancy. The doctor refused to perform an abortion despite the fact that not doing so would result in both the mothers death AND that of the foetus. What's worse is that he didn't even (as he was supposed to) contact another doctor who was willing to perform the operation. The reason for saying this is that I don't believe that abortion should be always refused, life is a little more complex than that. Logically speaking, as there's no evidence for a soul, one can't necessarily say life begins at conception and so the debate on abortion gets a little muddier. However, that's an entirely separate debate. 

edit2: Had a thought. You say that belief in God requires faith - on this we agree. God is unfalsifiable and as such cannot be proven or disproved. 

Say we've just met. I'm educated, intelligent (enough) and have never been exposed to any religions. You tell me about the bible, about God. Why on earth would I think you're anything but insane? How does one get to the point of faith without simply opening ones mind to every crackpot theory? Why should I choose to have faith in your god as opposed to any of the masses of others that have existed in history? ","1306889445"

"FL_Studio","t5_2rig0","I rigged up FL Studio for live performances on a laptop and actually did several of them using a technique I developed.  It's quite difficult to set up and was limited, but it was easy to use on stage.  

I reasoned that FL Delay 2 (effect) had a 8-beat maximum timing, and I wanted at least 32 beats, so I rigged up a series of 4 formula controllers that worked as counters.  Counters A,B,C,and D had simple IF statements that would cycle them for 8 of the 32 beats.  While playing, A would turn on and be ""listening"" (if I held a key), then 8 beats later it would mute and B would turn on and listen (if I held a key).  same with C and D. 

To be honest, it was a pain in the ass.  But it did produce that exact effect.  It started to degrade quality after about 3-4 minutes of looping as well.  I hope Image-line someday creates a loopmaker plugin for this purpose.  I used to brainstorm using this tool all the time.

That's just not true though.  
I know where the other guy's coming from. I'm really tall, and short drunk people always feel like they have to start something with me when I'm minding my own business. Height has no factor in how much respect I have for someone. These guys just shame themselves when they let their insecurities dictate their actions. You're gonna lose a hell of a lot more respect by being an insecure asshole than by being short.  
It's just so childish to bring others down to prove yourself. It's the life blood of grade-school. People should have grown out of that attitude. It's shameful and pathetic and makes the person look like nothing more than a child.  
The best way to prove that your own height doesn't affect your life is by not showing your insecurities and by *not letting it affect your life*. I'm a tall freak; I don't give a fuck. We've all got our own insecurities; taking them out on innocent bystanders is idiotic. ","1306889460"

"beer","t5_2qhg1","I do not understand the criteria. If Lagunitas is available, so may be Maximus or one of their seasonals at the same price. IPA is good, but they have better. Where's some really available stuff, like Sierra Nevada or a nice German lager you can grab at any grocier? If Samuel Adams, why not their seasonal 12 pack? Four to six kinds of beers for the burgeoning craft beer drinker.

I don't know, I just think this list is an after-thought. Here's mine:

1. Sam Adams seasonal 12-pack. ~12$. A whole range of tasty beers to try, and it gets updated every three months. It's like a beer of the month club delivered right to your grocery store!  If you are also in the mood right now Sam Adams has Nobel Pils, which I have yet to find a single person who does not like it.

2. Sierra Nevada 6-pack. &lt;10$. Just get whatever sixer the gas station has. It'll at least have Pale Ale, an American classic. They may have the seasonal like Glissade, which is good too. If you come upon a sixer of Torpedo, check out one of /r/beer's favorite single IPAs. A real introduction to why we love IPA.

3. Stone 22 ounce bomber. &lt;6$. Whatever bomber there is where you are is good. Smoked porter? Good. Sublimely self-righteous? Good. Vertical epic? Good. Everyone loves Stone, and here's a big ol' bottle to try them out. Enjoy in a glass.

4. Spaten Optimator pint. &lt;$3. Everyone loves Optimator. You'll love it, too. Get drunk and ponder why the logo is of two shovels.

5. Lagunitas seasonal sixer. &lt;10$. Lagunitas is my favorite. Every season is a miracle in a bottle. It's not Christmas without Brown Shugga', and it ain't the Superbowl without Hairy Eyeball. A bit of a commitment to purchase, but check the alcohol percentage. This'll get ya drunk.

6. New Belgium Mothership Wit sixer. ~8$. Easy summer drinking. I'm including this because I'm starting to run out of breweries that I know distribute nationally, and I know this is in all but a few states. Witbier is easy to drink and a great transition into craft beer. If you don't have it locally, Hoegaarden is another good wit. Just don't tell /r/beer... it's owned it part by Budweiser.

7. Rogue 22 ounce bomber. &lt;8$. This is another brewery that I think distributes nationally, but I'm not entirely sure. All their bombers are pretty tasty. If you can find Dead Guy ale in a six-pack I'd start there. They are often marked up a ways in the grocier, so try to find them at a liquor store.

8. CANADIAN BONUS Unibroue corked bomber. &lt;10$. La Fin Du Monde is a great beer to get into, and if you think you're up to the challenge, Trois Pistoles is fantastic. Their high alcohol content will get you tipsy, their great taste will leave you for more.

it would be nice to know exactly what they're looking for in terms of clearance. i was assigned a nuke spot on my first visit to meps, which lead me to believe that things would be ok, and then after my math waiver kicked back out and they tried to assign me a different rate until i could take the NAPT, and for that rate (CTI), they did the prescreen for the clearance, and that's when she said i was ineligible for it, so idk what the deal is exactly.

You're missing some irony, guy. 

&gt;Well I suppose you'll be the first volunteer to live their life according to some code made up by government bureaucrats(FYI it's designed to bring the most wealth back to the politicians with the most influence, not make you healthy and happy)

It's kinda ignorant to assume that every regulation serves that purpose. Sure, the most important ones seem to, but, believe it or not, there are regulations out there that actually *gasp* do good things for people. 

&gt;Because it's never happened before? Because the drug war in mexico is nothing really?

No, because there's no direct correlation between universal healthcare and the drug violence in Mexico. The drug war is a separate issue entirely. You can't just assert that ""universal healthcare will create a new prohibition"" and expect me not to get a chuckle out of your line of reasoning. Sure, the drug war is real. Health care is *not* the cause. 

&gt;You're so misguided it's painful to argue with you. Do you know what vice tax means? The reason alcohol and tobacco are taxed is because they were seen as immoral. It had nothing to do with health. Perhaps today that is the case, however this is not a good argument for healthcare since people who abuse those substances die earlier and end up costing far less in total healthcare. It's about control plain and simple.

How is taxing unhealthy foods not a vice tax? Same thing, different name. Semantics. The impetus for implementing the policies may be a little different, but it is *the same policy*. 

&gt;No, it is not.

I disagree.

&gt;Of course, back to the tyranny of good intentions.

No, I just have a different idea about the role of government. I'm as opposed to tyranny as you are, I just don't think things like universal healthcare can reasonably be considered tyrannical.

&gt;How can it not be? Expanded services required expanded revenue.

civil liberty–noun Usually, civil liberties.
1. the freedom of a citizen to exercise customary rights, as of speech or assembly, without unwarranted or arbitrary interference by the government. 

Being taxed at a higher rate doesn't mean your civil liberties are being eroded. Having access to health care does not mean you civil liberties are being eroded.

&gt;You do not know what that is. No one does.

Then why the fuck are you arguing with me? I have my beliefs. I stated them. You've denigrated and insulted me and been dismissive of my positions. But you don't know if they're wrong. No one does, right? You're somebody aren't you? If you sincerely believe that no one knows what will work best for most people, please, step aside, and let those of us who are willing to take risks have a go. The only way things will improve is if they change, and regressing back to one hundred percent completely free market solutions isn't going to improve anything. We've been down that road. That's why we have anti-trust laws and labor protections. Our system is a failure in its current state. It needs change. It needs to evolve, not devolve. Perhaps you should, too.

iii. Muhammad prescribed the death penalty for pre-marital sex, *leaving* Islam, criticising him and further to that waged 65 military campaigns *all* of them successful. Do you think somebody should be killed for leaving Islam? Or for defending their hometown and women folk from enslavement and *worse?*

&gt;Islamic law is a very big field, I see you've looked into the 'punishment' section of the law which is in fact the last to be implemented if an Islamic state were present.

I judge Islam based on how the most perfect Muslim *ever* practiced it. This was the original Islam to which you were referring right?

&gt;Islam claims that the laws are absolute and divine

Of course it does. Please refer back to 1).

&gt;of course as time progresses society will shift in its views and morals.

Some things are *never* justified. We haven't gotten to the worst of it yet.

&gt;I don't know what else to tell you other than it is what it is. I'm not knowledgeable enough to talk on this specific issue.

Fair play. I appreciate your honesty. Not enough people say *I don't know* when that is the case.

&gt;In the end, as a Muslim, I say what Abu Bakr (RA) once said. If the Prophet said it, then it's true.

Does that mean you believe it is moral and just that blasphemers should be put to death?

&gt;If Islam says it, then I will believe it. It is the primary source of truth I have

Do you have a reason to pick the Qur'an over any other book?

&gt;science will agree, if it doesn't then humans did something wrong.

How do you feel about claims of scientific revelation from the Bhagavant Gita, Guru Grants Sahib, the Torah, Talmud, Tanakh and The New Testament? Why should I believe your claims of scientific revelation over say, The Gita?

Finally, does that mean any observed evidence which contradicts Islam will be disregarded on account of your faith? Will *any* piece of evidence change your mind? Please answer this last question.

EDIT: should people who say ""#?%$ Muhammad"" meet this fate: **WARNING: NSFL** [Beheading of Nick Berg](http://jblog.jackcjohnson.com/Videos/muslim-videos/172.aspx) **WARNING: NSFL**

^That btw, is the single most horrific thing I will ever see in my life. I want you to see first hand what Muhammad prescribed for anyone who ""insulted"" him.

Do you believe this is a fitting punishment for blasphemers?","1306889512"

"reddit.com","t5_6","My parents always supported Ma n Pa businesses when I was growing up. Instead of eating at chain restaurants, we would eat at little one location shops, especially Bay Street Diner in downtown Port Orchard, which is now gone. Our family became pretty close with the owners, a big bad Vietnam Vet and his Vietnamese wife. They would constantly discount our meals and sometimes my brother and I would ride our bikes downtown and stop in, and we'd get free sodas and sometimes food. 

When my dad lost his job, my parents had virtually nothing to fall back on. My mom was working as much as she could at a little law office, where she was a paralegal, and she was barely keeping us afloat financially. The law firm's biggest client was Kitsap Transit, as the owner of the firm was close friends with the chairman. He had been authorized to take funds from KT's account for legal expenses that occurred. A year after my dad lost his job, my mom was doing bookkeeping for the firm to earn some extra money. She immediately noticed that funds in the account weren't matching up with what was on the books. She did further digging and discovered that her boss had stolen a whopping $168,000 from the account for personal expenses. My mom has always done what is right, so she turned all the evidence in to the prosecutor's office and quit her job. 

Now both of my parents were unemployed, and we were sinking fast. The owner's of the Bay Street Diner stepped up and donated a ton of non-perishable food to help us out. They asked for nothing in return, they just wanted to support us in our time of need. That made me realize how important some small businesses can be, so I shop there whenever I can, even though sometimes the prices can be higher. 

Thanks to the Bay Street Diner, we had a years supply of pudding mix. So...much...pudding.","1306889523"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","In all honesty I do insurance in Canada and it may completely vary but I'll give a few thoughts/suggestions. 

$400 per month seems high, especially for just liability insurance. 

With my company someone who pays on a 6 month policy pays more than someone who pays on a year policy. If you're on a month to month basis ask them to switch it over to a year policy. 

This is really different, but why would you have a deductible if you just have basic coverages? Where I am from the basic coverages only cover bodily injury and property damage so I am not sure where the deductible falls into place. It sounds to be like you have full coverage (collision and comprehensive) and you're just not aware of this. 

Tell your company that your car is for pleasure use only it makes a difference where I am. 

Tell them your mileage it makes a difference here. 

I don't know how insurance works in the US or why you feel like they're conning you, I'd never do that. Be upfront about your past history (claims, tickets, prior insurance) and there shouldn't be an issue. Honestly though go to a place like Allstate or Statefarm and get them to do a quote in person and when you sign up sign the application in front of them that will outline the price. 

Also if you live at home try and get discounts like 'multi car' or home/auto bundled. 

Where I live it does make a big difference (especially for males) to turn 25 and we can do that change IMMEDIATELY. 

Like I said it's tough being in a different country, but honestly that seems very high for just liability coverage. 

Oh and it is true that we drive rates based on postal codes aka 'territories' there's two postal codes in my city that when told to me (during a quote) I cringe and think ""this isn't gonna happen"". ","1306889529"

The key is to use them responsibly.  Despite all the personal finance classes in high school and college, this is a lesson that everyone has to learn for themselves. Either directly, or by watching someone they know get caught in the trap.

In my case, it was my neighbors at an apartment I used to live at. They wanted to buy a house, so they went out looking and found one they liked.  They were filling out the mortgage application, when the wife said: ""Honey, there's something I've been meaning to tell you...""

Turns out she had 2 credit cards that he didn't know about, and she had run up $14,000 on them by buying lunch for her coworkers, shoes &amp; clothes, and just trivial BS.  Needless to say, they didn't get the house, and sometime later, got divorced over the issue.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Well my comment was mostly a joke, but let's but honest math is a lot for useful than art, at least in the way ""useful"" is usually used, which was really the joke. Willis meant creative thinking has a higher abstract value to your life, or is maybe more useful in daily life, I misconstrued his words to take ""useful"" in the sense of useful to the world, in which case there can be no doubt.

Math is the foundation of pretty much all science and technology. So sure you can say programming computers, managing finance, calculating risk, building bridges, etc is all idle play, but it's a tough sell to say the least. When you say something like this:

&gt;I want to be cool in the summer, so I bought an air conditioner. It's purpose is to keep me cool, but what purpose is that? Keeping me cool serves no purpose other than itself.

You have actually unintentionally shown what I'm talking about. If math and engineering have built that air conditioner they have been useful. In other words they were used to accomplish a goal outside of themselves (cooling you), which you desired. So you can debate if keeping you cool is worthwhile, but you can't debate that math was useful to doing something.

Art on the other hand is something complete different, it isn't used to accomplish other things, it is the end goal. It is done for itself, and so people can enjoy it ultimately (as itself). Whether it is *better* or *more valuable* than math is debatable, but whether it is *more useful* is a very difficult argument, if not a all out ridiculous one.

Personally I'm not anti-art, but I really couldn't resist the joke.","1306889534"

In the case of that example (WiFi), you're correct, and I've even done it myself.

I'm sure there are *some* who overreact, but I don't think it's the vast majority, and the OP seemed to be making the case that it was (in his original post and in his comments). I guess I haven't seen it, or my definition of apeshit is different. ;-)

I see people complaining about it, and I see them saying that they hate the iOS notification system, but I don't see this as rage. Perhaps it's simply a matter of perspective and we see it differently. Some people complain about it more than others and some people use language that leaves a lot to be desired, but I have seen several reasoned arguments for a change to the notification system, as well as mockups and UI demonstration videos. This is all very good for iOS.

&gt;""And it's often brought up as a serious flaw.""

I think, as design goes, it is a major flaw. As I see it, the iOS notification system is designed to give the *applications* priority over the user. If I'm doing something (playing a game, to use my earlier example), I see absolutely no reason why my game should be paused so that another app can tell me something. I can be told that other apps need my attention without pausing the game and pulling focus away. Then, I can decide if the other apps should get my attention. Android does this. The design should be user-centric, not app-centric. I don't think Apple would design it this way today if the iPhone debuted tomorrow. In Apple's defense, they were reinventing the smartphone UI to a large extent and notifications were something they had to tackle. I think Android simply has a better system, but it came later and Google learned from Apple. ","1306889553"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I propose you have no clue what you are talking about. Fusion is only theoretically feasible with light elements (H, He being the best). The (final, nonradioactive) waste from commercial (U-235) fission is Pb-207 (stable). In theory you could get some energy from breaking it further, but good luck.

[Here's a graph](http://www.alaskajohn.com/physics/charts/binding_energy.jpg). Every thing to the left of Fe-56 can (in theory) produce energy under fusion, everything to the right can under fission. (ignoring the energy you have to put in to force it to occur).

The amount of change in binding energy per nucleon is the energy released, if you look at H/He you see this is a lot (which is why people are interested in fusion), and if you look at U-235 decay you see it isn't as much. The difference is in fusion you have a couple nucleons, (1-4) and in fission you have a lot (200+).

Hence fusion will almost never be practical, and more relevantly nuclear waste is physically/mathematically impossible to be useful as a fusion material. The only way it could help fusion is if you use it to some how breed tritium (but I'm not sure how many neutrons the waste produces).","1306889558"

Former UCF RA here:

The parking permits expire at midnight and are meant more for day events.  Just park off-campus and have a friend take you on campus.  Or walk. It's not far to the Libra community.  I think the F garage (behind the arena) might not require a decal at all, but that's on the far north end of campus.

Dorms aren't co-ed (ie: you won't get placed with roommates of the opposite gender) however visiting is pretty common.  Remember that you're responsible for your guest (ie: if they do stupid crap, you will get the penalty for it), but other than that it's free reign.

The rules in the housing handbook states you can't have a guest over for more than 5 or 7 nights per semester (I forget, been awhile since I read that), but honestly it's more a clause to protect your roommates and you from annoying guests/mooches (and UCF from overbearing parents) than anything else.  The RAs won't enforce it unless a roommate complains so if your guest is respectful and you work it out with your roommates, I doubt you'll have an issue.  Hopefully your roommates will have the same courtesy.","1306889562"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I dunno about the team with the best chance of beating them. Their regular season head-to-head record aside (3-0 in favor of Chicago), I think the Heat are a hard match up for the Bulls. Even a player as good as Rose can't deal with being guarded by James and Wade for the better part of the game. And as soft as Bosh is, Boozer is equally as soft, and Boozer had a memorably awful series on both ends of the court.

I think, from a match up standpoint, the Mavs look better on paper against the Heat than the Bulls. Miami has no answer defensively for Dirk, and, as old as Shawn Marion is getting these days, he's still an adequate defender on James. Not to mention that the Mavs don't run any plays for Marion, so he can focus on D. The Bulls were hurt in the series against the Heat because they were using Deng as the primary defender on James, but Deng's also one of their leading scorers. Deng was too tired from hustling on D to be an effective scorer. He pretty much disappeared after game 1.

And Bosh won't have as good a series now that he'll have Tyson Chandler in his grill. Noah did an adequate job on Bosh, but Thibodeau didn't switch Joakim onto Bosh until game 4 (an egregious coaching mistake for the ""coach of the year"" if you ask me). While Noah's got the hustle, Chandler is a better defender and longer than Noah.

Still, I think the series is up in the air. If Caron Butler hadn't gotten injured, I'd give the nod to Dallas. Of course, if Wade and James are both clicking, then it's all over, no matter how unconscious Dirk plays.","1306889577"

"WritersGroup","t5_2rh95","Not bad. You seem to know what you want to do in the scene, so that's a big head-start. I have a few changes to suggest, however. 
&gt;The man’s eyes held a gaze of blurred contempt, with a strong look of apathy. Blood and perspiration covered him all over, with his long disheveled brown hair hiding his face. He was dirty.

First off, you can cut the last sentence entirely. We got that he was dirty from the description, so it's just taking up space. 

Second, ""covered him all over"" is a bit redundant, but it's a good thing to describe him, so I'd say to just cut it to ""covered him.""

Finally, your description of the look in his eyes is a bit off. With two entirely different looks in them, you should either cut one or make them separate and longer. I'd suggest changing ""blurred contempt"" (not even sure what that looks like), and expanding on ""a strong look of apathy.""

Aside from that, I was rather put-off by the opening lines of ""the Big Bad."" I couldn't help but feel like he was repeating himself with different words, and that just made him seem insane to me. It's the right type of dialogue for him to be saying (threatening, menacing, etc), but he doesn't need to say it thrice over.

Two last things. I think you have a great chance to compare the unnamed man taking his chances with the bullet and his bad gambling habits, and the last line of dialogue seems out of place. ""The Big Bad"" seemed rather calm before shooting the man, and now he's just stating that he's annoyed.

Really though, you have made this far more entertaining than the other people in the writing class I'm in. Not that it is saying much, but you seem to have potential, from the little we have seen so far.

EDIT: I might add more later, but I have to get to class now. I hope this has helped some.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","well, I'm pretty sure you have all the tools you need (this proof is using only what you should know already) - the trick is to get the right idea of how to your the tools; unfortunately being able to find the right idea comes only with practice, practice, practice...

e.g. many times proofs with divisibility come down to writing down [all the possibilities](http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/fea7c/difference_of_powers_of_2_divides_difference_of/c1fbj1s) - i mean there are not that many for 3 and 5 residue classes; also it helps to just start writing things down, even if it is not 100% the right track you find something that will be useful - e.g. when I was writing down (9) and if b = d/4 it took me a split second to realize that then a must also be d/4 and then the LCM would be just d - thus that option wasn't possible - I didn't know it when I started writing down the proof. This part of proving a statement is called analysis (not that kind that deals with calculus!) you basically analyze what is given what that means as well as where you need to get to and then you try to bring those two closer and closer together until you connect them through rigorous steps; inevitably there will be paths (tries) that don't lead anywhere, but hopefully sooner or later you'll realize what you need to do and then it is just a matter of using the tools you have to get there...","1306889590"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was younger I was told that if I took something from Walmart I could then return it the next day and get money on a card. So, like any enterprising youngster, I went to test the theory. I went in and found some camcorder batteries that were like 120 dollars a piece and took two of them. I went to the bathroom and removed the security sticker so the alarm wouldn't go off and proceed out the door.

I got through the alarms and a man grabs me on the arm, and at the moment I knew I was fucked. So, I ran, in flip flops, across the parking lot faster than I've ever ran before. I kicked the off halfway because they were becoming cumbersome. I get to the side of the parking lot and climb over the fence next to the highway. I walk down the highway a bit and hide the batteries in a ditch. When I came back out an officer on a motorcycle was coming down the road and blue lighted. I darted across the highway and the cop followed. I ran into a grove of pine trees(or something like that) and started barreling through it all as it was rather thick. The cop was getting smacked by the branches I was pushing out of my way.

The whole time the cop was telling me he was going to kick my ass and was going to shoot me when I stopped running. So, I kept on going. I found a group of three trees in a triangle and climbed up about 20 feet and saw the officer looking for me. By this time there were six cops all with flashlights looking for me. I waited for almost an hour until I heard one of them say that son of a bitch got away. I waited like 30 more minutes and continued through the woods. I ran up on an apartment complex and saw a mexican guy next to his truck and asked if he could take me back to my place. He didn't understand english, so I had to use my elementary spanish to get a ride. He gave me a ride back and I don't think I'll ever be that lucky again.","1306889619"

What about a Lambic / Gueuze?  What about a chardonnay like Tripel or a dry acidic Saison?  A trappist quad?  I don't think any of those have what you'd describe as a 'beer' flavor.  Not so incedentally this is usually what I start off with when trying to educate non-beer drinkers about beer.  Begin with something they can relate to (Kasteel Rouge or Monks Cafe are usually my starting points, because they taste like juice), and if they like it try to expand on that.

Like I said, I think most people just haven't been exposed to the broader spectrum of flavors possible within a beer.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","There's a few reasons mono-colored decks might use fetch lands:

* Deck-thinning. Fetch lands allow your deck to have more lands at the beginning of the game (and more chances to draw land when you need land), and then take lands out of your deck as the game progresses, making it so you'll draw useful cards later on.

* Shuffle effects. With cards like Brainstorm and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, you can put cards you don't like on top of your deck, shuffle them away with a fetch land, and draw something else.

* Landfall triggers. Steppe Lynx and Plated Geopede are very strong when you can trigger them twice on the same turn.

* Filling the graveyard. In older formats, they are helpful for cards with Threshold, and cards like Grim Lavamancer.

As for that specific deck, it's mostly the first two points. Blue Sun's Zenith is the main win condition. If you lose it, Time Spiral can shuffle it back into your deck, or you can Cunning Wish for the other Zenith in the sideboard, or a Brain Freeze to mill your opponent out.","1306889625"

This doesn't mean that all attractive women are like this.  Furthermore, you're admitting that you have met women that seem like nice people.

After a minute or two, he was joined by 2 more. My friend who was driving went off-road and put a little distance in between us and the cops, so I had him get back on the road, and when he slowed down enough, I jumped out and started walking like nothing happened. Cops drove right past me and chased him. In the second, I was sitting in the passenger seat of my own car(a 1978 Pontiac Grand Prix), rolling a joint and drinking a beer(it was about 11 PM), and my friend who we'll call Scott was driving. Anyways, I had just gotten it rolled when a cop lit us up. Scott just looked at me like his whole world was about to end, so I screamed at him ""PUNCH IT!!!"", and he did. We lived in a little podunk one-cow town in the East Bay, so there weren't that many people out, so I just started yelling directions, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, LEFT, and so on, and somehow, somewhere along the way we lost the cop. Eventually I had him park in someone's driveway, and I sparked that joint up, finished my beer, took off and ditched my car in the Safeway parking lot and we walked home without any further incident.

Personally, I do support the death penalty only if the person convicted is 100% guaranteed guilty and I would always error in favor of life even, even if that means having no one get the death penalty.  But that brings about the question of getting convicted for any major length of stay in jail.  As there are a very slim minority of innocents convicted to death, there are a slim minority sentenced to major lengths in jail including life without parole.  You could of easily said ""You can't divorce the institution of Criminal Justice from the risk of convicting innocent people""  Is having an innocent person spending their life in jail an acceptable risk?

Nebraska, on the other hand, should be excellent. 1982 and 1994 alone should make the fans a little agitated. Each program has effectively cost the other a national title, and both fanbases probably feel a little cheated over it. I respect the Huskers and I think they're a quality program, so I hope we can develop a real rivalry that, while passionate, is also a positive one.

I also think Wisconsin has some potential as a rivalry, but we'll have to see. Nebraska is definitely a big opportunity to develop a real in-conference rival, assuming Iowa doesn't try and steal them first. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Also, as another [poster noted](http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/hof8x/practicing_panic_stops_advice_needed/c1x2gl4) most guys aren't using their front brake properly.  Up until a month ago I'd have to put myself into that category.  

When you start practicing hard stops relying completely upon the front you start to see just how much more force the wheel can take without slipping.  Chances are most 2 wheeled brakers are only using half of the available traction of their front tire.  That means that with a good front brake only stop I can probably stop faster than any of them.  

Of course both brakes handled perfectly is ideal.. but if I had to pick one to master first I'd go with the front and then start incorporating more and more rear once my front brake skills were as close to perfect as they are going to get.  I wish I had tried this 10 years ago.  Just goes to show.. you never know everything.  ","1306889636"

Today I went out and bought weights at Dick's so tonight's Sculpt was with 13 lbs and MAN did I feel it.  I didn't think the add'l 5 lbs would make such a difference but it did.  Exercises like heavy pants and bicep curls were still fairly easy but back scratchers and swimmer's presses were ridiculous.

When you do pushups and chair lifts, do you do the alternate versions?  I tried tonight to do a regular pushup and could only do 3.  Doing them on my knees instead of my feet is the only way I can get to 15.  Same with the chair lifts; i bend my knees or else i can barely do 2 or 3.  

Overall I'm happy with my progress.  I haven't seen a lot of weight loss, but I'm not following a strict diet either.  I watch what I eat and cut out fast food and soda, but that's about it.  This morning I was 261.4.  I guess 5 lbs isn't bad, though.  How about you?","1306889639"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I want it so I can play with my little brother. He constantly asks me to play games with him, but all he has is a DS. I bought him a PS3 but his mom broke it and told me video games were the root of all evil. Then I tried with an Xbox 360. He was able to get about half way through Halo Reach before his mom did the same thing. My brother hides the games I buy him for DS, and uses his little sisters pink DS to play games on. He only gets to see me about once a month because I live in Toronto and he lives in AZ, plus his mother hates me. (It's a long story, basically I called child services on her for beating him.)

He has a shitty life at home, and the dream of being able to get away from his mother and be with me is the only thing that keeps him going in school.  I'd love for him to be able to play DS with me online, instead of just constantly sharing the system on some basic minigames in wario ware. I'd love to hack both our systems so he only had an SD card to hide instead of tons of little cartidges.

I've tried steam, and other systems but every time his mother manages to take them away or break them. She's obsessed with making everything perfect for my little sister and wouldn't dare touch the DS. I just miss my little brother and I want to be there for him when I can't be. I don't get to call, text, or chat with him. Hes sometimes suicidal, and begs for me to find a way to be there more often than I am. My bank account is basically empty from flying to see him, we've cut back on the electric, and water in the entire house, and we're basically broke. My husband can understand flying to see him but he doesn't understand the need for a DS or games in general. Hes quickly becoming less sympathetic to the flights and I'm hoping that I can let my little brother down easy by promising him we'll ALWAYS be in touch and able to play.



My brother is 14. He lives in a small town called Amado. They have no car, no running water and the electric gets shut off a lot. He steals neighbors wi-fi and uses well water from a nearby ranch. My (our) mother makes him work ridiculously hard for all the neighbors to pay for her meth habit. He doesn't have almost any free time, and when I come to visit it's a huge relief for him to just stay with me in a hotel with AC and a place to watch TV.

Fingers crossed..

Right across the street is a McDonalds that is almost always empty. I'm convinced that the McDonalds only stays open to leach off of customers who don't know yet why people wait 30-45 minutes (because that's how long the wait can be when this place is packed) for a delicious White Mana burger.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I agree.  I think there is a higher proportion of younger women on this forum (eg college-age, judging by so many posts that reference school) and many (most?) young women of around 20 don't know if they want children yet, or think that they don't.  Of those that don't, some will never want them, others may change their mind in a decade or so, and others may sadly end up in the ""40+ TTC"" section in fertility forums struggling physically, financially and emotionally to bear children, but not manage it.

All respect to those that prefer to remain childless, but there is nothing shameful about wanting to have children.  Nor is there anything shameful about it being a ""biological urge"".  I've read posts on here where a young woman feels she needs to fight the desire for children just because it's biological, and others weigh in and agree with her.

Well - sex is just a biological urge, no one *needs* sex - and yet we spend endless time celebrating it and encouraging it (despite the risks and downside that it can have) - so why not the same for the ""biological clock"" urge?  If you have that urge - celebrate it.  It's not weak or shameful. If you don't, great for you.  It's about choice.  And critically it's about accepting that people's choices can and do change - both ways.  There are also women who start out wanting children who end up preferring to be child free.","1306889673"

The Human rights museum is an ill-conceived, idea that isn't going to be attracting any tourists anyways. It only serves to highlight the horrors of a discriminated against people who aren't even discriminated against anymore.

The new airport means more pollution, more noise, and more ill spent tax dollars. How is that a good thing?

No body is going to get excited over buses.

At least having booze in grocery stores will make it easier for all the kids to rip off booze from safe way. And perhaps help you forget your living in a frozen bug infested swamp.

And Winnipeg has always been a center for transportation and shipping. That,s reason they built a city at the intersection of TWO IMPORTANT SHIPPING RIVERS. It hasn't made anything remotely cool.

What they don't tell you:

1.  Your former statement, ""I'll graduate with 2 years of real world experience"" is almost totally false.  When a job asks for ""2 years of experience"" they **do not** count internship experience.  It's a plus to having no internships, of course, but in the shooting out resumés/landing interviews game its barely a help.

2.  Your latter statement, ""I have a good chance of getting hired right out of college at the place I currently have an internship at"" is enormously on the money.  *This* is the value of an internship - it gets your foot in the door and as long as you're competent, gives a company a reason to hire you.

Her conclusion is two-fold: (1) that it's better to be addicted to something relatively harmless than to something very harmful; (2) that playing video games can be a heck of a lot better than becoming an alcoholic, and she even explains how it can be a great bonding experience as well. The idea is that if he's going to have an addiction, it's better that it's video games than alcohol or drugs. Maybe instead of trying to change her brother and ultimately swap one addiction for another one (likely more harmful), her brother's girlfriend should instead try to embrace his love of video games.

We have to pick a side if we want the conflict to end with a united libyia we have to support the rebels OR gaddafi 

if your not willing to do that we have option number 3 spliting the country into east and west libyia all well and good for those in the east. But gaddafi isn't going to step down unless he is forced to otherwise he would have gone already. What we would see is very drawn out negotations with Gaddafi draging his feet at every opportunity. And at the same time he'd be rounding up any opposition he could find and haveing them executed (as hes already been doing)

Eventualy the rebels would rise up again unhappy with our botched attempt to get gaddafi to step down and try to get rid of gaddafi themselfs, you saw the protests he is as unpopular in the west as the east, so then what we bomb them in order to maintain the cease-fire. 

So now we're in a situation where we are bombing the arab spring and keeping gaddafi in power. So that we can remove gaddafi from power with minimun lost of civilian life. Thats just crazy situation for everyone involved and im sure you can see why NATO didn't do as you suggest.","1306889741"

* Get a % of money up front.

* Don't do work for free. This includes mock-ups and anything else the client thinks they can con you into doing before they ""decide"" to go with you.

* Get a % of money up front. (yes, it's worth repeating)

* Get referrals. ""Do you know of anyone that could use my services? Can you think of just one person I could try to contact?""

* Offer referral deals. Example: 10% rebate/refund check for every paying customer you refer to me. Refer 10 paying customers and your job was free. (adjust % as necessary)

* Learn the basics of selling &amp; closing. You'll essentially be selling your services and since you won't have a sales team, you really should learn how.

* Incorporate.  File for an LLC in your state. (use legalzoom.com)

* Pay your taxes. You might need to pay quarterly taxes. Look that up for your state/locale. When federal tax time comes around you'll want to file a schedule C with your 1040. Don't forget self-employment tax. Turbotax is great for this.

Don't let extra time in school or a few more years deciding your future get in the way.  Trust me, it's more important to find something you want to do as opposed to finding something quicker.

Park Ranger sounds good to me, but you might have to be willing to move to somewhere remote in order to find a job.  

On a personal note, I lied to myself for a few years saying that I wanna be a engineer for the money.  I knew that's not what I really wanted.  After thinking about it, I knew I wanted to pursue being a teacher.  I've lost a few years coming up with the decision, but I'm happier with my path now.","1306889748"
"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; I want competition in the market.

Um, Libertarians are about protecting property rights, not about fostering competition.  Sure, some Libertarians lie to themselves (and others) that freeing businesses from government regulation would somehow magically make businesses compete like mad and drive down prices, rather than what anyone with two functioning neurons knows would happen, every corporation merging into every other corporation to drain every last drop of profit out of everything.

&gt; Patents are a government created construct that is used to create artificial scarcity where there is none.

Yeah... that's what the Native Americans thought about *land*.  You can't *own the earth*.  You can't *control mother nature*.  These are intangible items.

This is the future, and all the created wealth that is allowing the ultra-wealthy to buy the US government at the expense of the American citizenry is intangible wealth created from intangible commodities, like derivatives and movie rights and stock swaps, and collateralized debt obligations and software and royalties and music and mortgages and  lottery tickets and taxpayer bailouts.  These are intangible items only given value through an artificial scarcity, just like you think patents are.

Look, historically Libertarianism has been used to justify unmitigated greed, and the idea it's okay to cause misery and suffering as long as it makes you rich.  In contemporary politics, it's used to justify the idea that you can refuse to serve black people in restaurants. 

Look, I was a Libertarian once, I read Atlas Shrugged when I was 13 and felt like she was describing me, an incipient superman who is better than everyone around me.  But I grew out of it, and if you mistakenly think that Libertarian philosophy is compatible with reducing corporate profits to save human life, then you'll either grow out of being a Libertarian when you understand it better, or you'll go on being the worlds dumbest Libertarian.

Many times the cops would pa-troll the hood looking for kids in the houses. We'd hide out and what not, but it got to the point where the cops would just come running into the houses when we were there and we go running. Sometimes up to 10 cops would show up to chase six or seven kids. I never got caught.

Then again when I was 16 in my friends car... we went around a turn on I-20 in Atlanta at about 100mph, and the cop hit is sirens on the inside of the turn. We ran.... too the next exit. Pulled off on an exit and rolled up into a club behind a dumpster and jumped out like we had been there the whole time.

Then once on my motorcycle in the middle of Arizona.... well 20 bikes vs 2 cops, not gonna happen.

Then once in indonesia...

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One snowy December evening I was sitting around getting drunk with my buddies and someone suggested we needed an XMAS tree for the house. At about 2am 2 of us stumbled down to the local supermarket and each grabbed a tree. We lived in a relatively rural area so the store closed at 8pm and nobody lived too close.

Like a gift from little baby jesus the trees were lined up outside waiting for our drunken hands to take hold. We each grabbed one and proceeded to get the hell out of there. As we were walking back home we saw some blue lights heading in our direction. Someone must have either heard us or seen us and called it in. The road we were on had no cover and there we were, underage, intoxicated and carrying stolen christmas trees. Just as the cop car was getting within our line of sight one of us had the bright idea to just plant the trees in the snow and hide behind them. With only a few seconds to spare we pushed the stems into the snow, ducked down and held our breath. The cop whizzed by and never slowed down. We hauled ass home and never saw another car.

That Christmas I had an awesome tree that I decorated with Natty cans. ","1306889786"

Until the guy who yelled about the cops being at the party didn't break a stride and ran right out the sliding glass back door to the patio and kept going.

Everyone got up and ran out the back as the cops came through the house.  I myself heard a female police officer RIGHT BEHIND ME yelling at me to stop, which I did not do.  In fact, I ran faster, over her protests.

This was just down the street from my house, so I knew the neighborhood well, and I lost her pretty quick by running around through various weird yards that I had known from playing hide-and-go seek throughout my childhood.

Nearly two-thirds of the US population lives within 100 miles of the border, according to the ACLU, and the border zone encompasses scores of major metropolitan areas and even entire states.

&gt;Customs and Border Patrol, a component of DHS, was authorized by Congress to operate within a ""reasonable"" distance of the border, and that distance has been set at 100 miles in regulations governing CBP, the ACLU says. The authorization has been in place for decades, but complaints about abuses of the extended border zone began to ramp up as CBP was expanded and folded into DHS after 9/11. ...

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt; Why then, stop with animals? Plants don't have nervous systems, but deprive one of sunlight or water and you can observe clear evidence that it suffers as a result. I might add that a blade of grass is far less likely to infringe upon my rights than a mosquito or a dog, shouldn't we give it the same courtesy?

Singer (and most people, really) have a different idea of suffering to you. The usual definition of suffering is the subjective experience of a negative sensation or emotion. Plants can't suffer because they have no brain to produce this *subjective experience*. If they react to negative stimuli, it's because of a reflex, not because of a conscious reaction to avoid suffering. That's why it makes sense to stop at animals.

&gt; In fact, if you really believe that all animals have rights, isn't it our duty therefore to try and convict all carnivores? Face it, the natural world is full of brutality. We humans may have partial success isolating ourselves from the ""law of the jungle"" but it's absurd to force the laws of man on all of biology.

Yes, it would be absurd to force the laws of man on all of biology, since they can't understand our laws enough to be reasonably expected to follow them. Which is precisely why they are not considered moral agents: they don't know that the suffering they cause is bad. Humans are in a special position where we are the *only* species on earth that can act as moral agents, which puts the responsibility for ethical behaviour on *us*. Well ok, some other mammals might be able to be taught to understand the basics of ""good"" and ""bad"" behaviour, but humans are certainly the custodians of morality.","1306889809"

&gt;For, as a federal court in Chicago held yesterday, the statute that shields web sites from liability for defamatory posts by their users can indeed result in situations where there is no remedy for speech adjudged to be defamatory, and thus outside the protections of the First Amendment. See, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 339 (1974) (""there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact"").

The case is Blockowicz v. Williams. The above link gives a good summary and the ruling itself.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; gnostic isn't ""just knows"" it's ""possessing intellectual or esoteric knowledge of spiritual things""

These are *not* mutually exclusive. Yes, gnostics claim to possess knowledge. So do non-gnostics. What distinguishes the gnostics is *how* they believe knowledge can be acquired. Gnostics believe in *internal, experiential knowledge of God*. As in enlightenment, as in ""know in your heart"", as in closing our eyes and *just knowing*, because God wants you to know:  

[The word 'Gnosticism' is a modern construction, though based on an antiquated linguistic expression: it comes from the Greek word meaning 'knowledge', gnosis. However, **gnosis itself refers to a very specialised form of knowledge**, deriving both from the exact meaning of the original Greek term and its usage in Platonist philosophy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism)

[Ancient Greek was capable of discerning between several different forms of knowing. These different forms may be described in English as being propositional knowledge, indicative of knowledge acquired indirectly through the reports of others or otherwise by inference (such as ""I know of George Bush"" or ""I know Berlin is in Germany""), and empirical knowledge acquired by direct participation or acquaintance (such as ""I know George Bush personally"" or ""I know Berlin, having visited"").](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism)

[Gnosis refers to knowledge of the second kind. Therefore, **in a religious context, to be 'Gnostic' should be understood as being reliant not on knowledge in a general sense, but as being *specially receptive to mystical or esoteric experiences of direct participation with the divine.*** Indeed, in most Gnostic systems the sufficient cause of salvation is this 'knowledge of' ('acquaintance with') the divine. This is **commonly identified with a process of inward 'knowing' or self-exploration**, comparable to that encouraged by Plotinus (c. 205–270 AD).""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism)
  
  
**It was this form of ""knowing"" that Huxley was rejecting when he coined the word ""agnostic"":**


[""Agnostic was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 to describe his philosophy which **rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge. Early Christian church leaders used the Greek word gnosis (knowledge) to describe ""spiritual knowledge.""**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism)

&gt; gnostic is NOT 'just knows'...its knows with evidence

That's what *agnostic* means: acquiring knowledge by reasoning about evidence, which Huxley called ""the fundamental axiom of modern science"". He was explicitly rejecting the gnostic idea that you could have mystical knowledge. If ""gnostic"" meant ""knowing with evidence"", he never would have coined the word ""agnostic""; it would be redundant.","1306889820"

"AcademicPhilosophy","t5_2r7v0","I have access to JSTOR through my university. I also get access to a number of other philosophy journals where JSTOR is lacking. Check the websites of the philosophers whose papers you are trying to locate; often they'll have links to drafts. Worse comes to worse, email the philosopher, or request it through some kind of interlibrary loan if you have access to it. I hope that is somewhat helpful...ask a professor you know well to help you out with this as well if your university's article access is lacking or it is totally abstruse or convoluted. 

It is perfectly okay if a sample doesn't reflect your passions. Even better in your case: you prefer epistemology, however philosophy of mind is a close enough neighbor. However, I don't think even dialectical proximity matters all that much. If you have a professor suggesting you use a paper as your sample, you ought to heed her advise, and at least begin looking at it, rereading literature, getting comments, and even submitting to a low-key, fast-turn-around journal for an anonymous referee's comments (again, ask your professor). Unless pursuing this paper would bore you to a level at which you don't see yourself ever completing it (out of lack of motivation or whatever), then do something else. 

If you do go for the phil of mind paper, in your personal statements, just make sure the reader will understand that your interests diverge from the content of your sample (if it's a good paper, no one will mind). Lastly, make sure the paper is in a neighborhood of 20 pages long (some places are okay with 15, but every place will surely be okay with 20) and even more importantly: make sure it delves deeply into the topic at hand, and engages with the contemporary literature in a thoughtful and coherent way. I've read one professor on a PhD selection committee blog about something like the following: often, before committing to reading an entire sample, I will flip to approximately the middle and see if the author is getting into the nitty-gritty of an issue or debate.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think when I said that addiction is as subjective as psychiatry I mean that both ways. As much as psychiatry is a medicine, so is addiction medicine. But in the same ways that psychiatry becomes a subjective 'soft science' I think addiction medicine has the same problem. 

Where do you draw the line between someone who acts a certain way, and a disease? It's not an easy question, and certainly not one that I have the answer to. In the same vein, where do you draw the line between someone who smokes too much pot and the disease of addiction. 

I think everyone can agree on the extremes. The 32 year old stoner with no future who hasn't been 24 hours sober in 10 years is probably an addict. The guy who occasionally lights up a joint after work to help himself relax is probably fine. But there is a lot of room between those two folks. 

I also don't thin that drugs are made illegal because of addictive potential. I know that's an often used excuse, but I don't think it's true. If addictiveness was a main criteria we wouldn't stand for gambling, alcohol and fast food. Not to mention all of the addictive controlled substances that are perfectly legal like vicodin and adderal. 

I don't really know why certain drugs are made illegal, maybe its just bad policy. Someone probably has a better idea than me. ","1306889833"

These quotes are so frequently upvoted because people like to relate to each other through shared experience. Rage comics fill that same niche in multiple ways - they're often about a relateable experience, and they use repeated symbols which are accepted to represent a relateable emotion.

That sort of covers why they're popular, but not really why some people find them funny. A lot of them aren't funny - you're supposed to go 'Hah yes that happens to me also', not 'LOL what a funny joke'. Some of them are funny because people use the repeated symbols in a novel way, or to represent a situation that's funny in itself. If you don't understand what the symbols mean, or do but think the symbols are stupid, that's probably why you don't find the 'funny' rage comics funny.

[Femicide in El Salvador, 160 such torture-killings in the first three months of 2011](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America-Monitor/2011/0524/Violence-against-women-rises-in-El-Salvador). 

What is femicide? 

&gt; Murders defined in this way typically involve sexual violence, mutilation, and torture, with the mangled bodies of victims often left in public places.

It goes on, and interesting to keep in mind the rightful outrage for what happened to one Syrian kid, compared to the so many others suffering a similar fate that go mostly unnoticed.

&gt; Hundreds of women’s bodies have been found, often mutilated and raped, with little action from local law enforcement. As organized crime has spread south from Mexico into El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras over the last 15 years, vicious killings of women appear to have followed. Some observers have warned that the killings of women in the region are reaching ""epidemic"" levels.

In fairness, I doubt it is Christian thinking fueling the Latin American ultra-violence that mirrors what is being done by various Arab regimes, and mirrors similar torture-killings in sub-saharan Africa. IMO it is a symptom of a failed country where people are reduced to the crudest form of tribalism. Same can be said for where routine torture-killings take place elsewhere in the world, the violence is usually done against members of different groups within the same country. (Syria's Assad is from a small minority tribe, and I wouldn't be surprised if most of his security apparatus is from the same tribe, and on odds alone the kid is likely not from Assad's tribe.)","1306889864"

"MTB","t5_2qo3d","A moment about suspension If I may.

after the frame and perhaps wheels/tires this is hugely important. Suspension forks are not just springs and oil baths with an orifice (well actually thats all they are), suspension keeps you on the trail and finds grip in areas where you would not other wise suspension also covers your ass when you screw up.  However cheap suspension is very likely worse than no suspension. it is heavy slow to rebound nearly impossible to tune (if anybody knows what that preload lever does on suntour and rst forks please tell me) the features on it rarely work for long.  If you can get a fork from a major do it There will come a time where you are riding you will run out of talent you will look at your fork and go, ""this is all on you  man"".  

When buying a used bike look for theses brands of frok or shock

* Cannondales with a lefty or headshock (super proprietary but ok if the bike is in good shape)

* DT Swiss (boutique and expensive as hell but light and innovative)

* FOX (fork is probably due for a rebuild as soon as you get it otherwise stanchion wear can be pretty severe)

* ROCK SHOX (judy era or newer is best however the old stuff is ok if its low miles)

* Marzocchi (bombproof but heavy 07 and older are made in italy except for a few 03 and older are entirely italian)

* Manitou (be careful their old stuff is good newer stuff is iffy brand new stuff should be fine

* White Brothers  (dont know much but they do make a tandem fork for you tandem mtbers)

* X fusion (primarily an aftermarket all mountain fork)

* there are a few other boutique brands I doubt you will run into them

AVOID USED BICYCLES WITH

* SR SUNTOUR (they sell some aftermarket forks that are pretty high end however I am so wary of their low end i do not trust their top tier stuff.

* RST (rapid suspension technology)(impossible to get parts for impossible to contact easily the worst suspension I have ever ridden seriously fuck these guys mountain bikes below $400 should all be rigid)

On a new bike sr suntour and rst are probably ok the elastomers are fresh in them or they have upped their qc.

Your lbs should have somebody there that can help you out with suspenison settings (sag, rebound, and compression damping if available) 

Also have your fork rebuilt on its service intervals or inspect it regularly.  Bicycle forks are INSANELY expensive. rebuilds are relatively cheap.  shops should charge around 100 to rebuild the fork+ parts some do it for less others more suck it up a new fork is 5 times that.

P.S. I cannot stress how much you should not use bikesdirect if you dont know what you are doing.  improperly assembling a bicycle and riding it on the road is dangerous off road it can be down right fatal. A bike shop will build and properly tune the bike so that you can have fun off road.  If you buy the bd bike and have a shop build it they will and will charge you several hours worth of labor to undo what you did wrong assembling it and to get it working properly in the first place.  Quality control on bd bicycles is not what it is on trek specialized and giant even though they are all made in taiwan especially since a professional mechanic is not looking at it.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I understand that scaling down is not very hard as AMD has already done it once on the same architecture (55 to 40nm), but there are still reasons that this move makes no sense.

* AMD would have to change from the semiconductor foundry that currently produces AMD GPUs and CPUs TSMC since it skipped and cannot produce on the 32nm process.

* AMD has newer generations of GPUs that produces more GFLOPS/Watt even on the same 40nm selling for as low as 35$ to consumers(and thats the entire card, not just the GPU.)

I guess its still possible that they want the r700 for some backwards compatability reasons. The chart also says that they will use an IBM POWER6 processor, which will be 5 years old at the time of project cafe release, so atleast it is internally consistent. ","1306889882"

Obviously people would fight to have one, just to sell and get rich, but it will not be a real success because the same people will continue to use their iPhones, Androids and Blackberries to talk. 

The only solution for them is: 

* fire all top managers starting with Ballmer.
* change the company name or better create another company.
* hire someone with vision, a talent.
* make people work with passion, build a culture.
* spend at least 5 years developing something cool and new.

Sure it's a better deal than going to the movies once a month every month for 5-7 years but saying it's 7 years of entertainment just isn't true.

Hell even when I was playing very regularly I wouldn't even say I was entertained half the time. I was killing time or grinding mobs (or quest chains back in the day) to get atunement, or wiping on new bosses/content. 

Sure it was fun in the end when we did it but most of my enjoyment wasn't even from the game it was from the people I played with. People I continue to talk to on forums or play other games with that don't cost me $15 a month. 

Personally I get more time/enjoyment out of buying a lot of the $10-$15 indie games on steam and playing those with friends.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, you also need to look at it this way.  Firefly was definitely original and awesome, and the story arc with Christina Hendricks was the greatest thing to happen to Christina Hendricks enthusiasts since Mad Men, but the series run was a scant 14 episodes, which clocks in at under 10 hours, plus another two hours for Serenity.

While it's quality entertainment, for sure, if OP is looking to get really into a more expansive show's universe over the course of the summer, shows that had multiple season runs have the obvious advantage of longer, more detailed story arcs.  

Naturally, shows like Firefly, Rome, and Deadwood are amazing and had shorter runs, so it depends if OP is looking for something he can bang out in a week and be glad that he watched, or if he wants to invest the time into watching tens of hours of other classic TV shows.","1306889905"
"sex","t5_2qh3p","I have vaginismus too. So, *hugs*. Feel free to ask me absolutely anything.

My husband and I have a fantastic sex life in spite of my condition, because we enjoy whatever sexual activities are fun and comfortable for both of us.

Vaginismus is very common in women and can be caused by so many things. For example, runners and dancers can get it because their pelvic muscles are held tightly during their exercise. You don't have to worry about assigning blame - you can just work on fixing it together.

I would recommend telling her parents and trying to use their health insurance. Another name for the condition is high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction, which may sound less scary to share.

A urogynaecologist (urogynecologist in US English) is a sexual pain specialist and can refer your girlfriend on to other treatment. Pelvic floor physiotherapy is one of the best treatments with a high success rate, using the techniques of biofeedback (to understand how the muscles work and gain conscious control) and myofascial release (to massage away tight spots in the muscles) among others. Your girlfriend may also benefit from sex therapy at the same time to feel better about her situation and work around/through her issue.

[Heal Pelvic Pain by Amy Stein](http://www.healpelvicpain.com/) is the best book about how to resolve vaginismus (and other pelvic pain disorders). It shows you how to do the stretching and tells you how to do internal and external massage. It's only US$10 for Kindle/Kindle reader, is cheap in print, or you can get it out at a library.

Question: why can't she touch herself without underwear? Is it because it hurts? If so, she may have vulvodynia as well as vaginismus. A urogynaecologist will be able to pin down the diagnosis further. If this is just something you have self diagnosed, it would be worthwhile for her to get swabbed by her regular doctor for common infections that can also cause pain.","1306889905"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Are you talking about 1 night or long term? 

First off, don't drink at a bar. 

If you are talking long term, get some kind of prescription that reacts with alcohol (for a $5.00 copay or whatev). This will greatly reduce the amount of alcohol you need to get drunk, thus lowering your cost. Then, get a liquor with high potency that you can mix. I would recommend everclear (151 is potent but has a strong flavor that is harder to mask). Then get your favorite Juice or pop, or whatever. Take a pill, and you will only need 1 or 2 shots of everclear in a glass of juice that should taste delish. My rough estimate is that you can get pretty messed up for $2-3 a day over the span of a few weeks. Also, don't do this, because its not good for you. 

Short term? YOu're best off splitting the bil with some other low-budget drinkers. Get a half-gallon of liquor and your favorite mixers. $7-$8 dollars should do the trick if roughyl 4 people split the half gallon.

I finally realized god was going to do nothing to help me. I'd been latched on to the idea that even if this life sucked, heaven would be there to lick my wounds. I only clung to religion a little longer because the fear of hell was so instilled in me it was almost impossible to eject.

Murder (which suicide also counts as) is one of the seven deadly sins, which are the seven hardest to absolve yourself of. To sit there and say someone who (hypothetically) was going to kill themselves and their kids because of the oncoming Rapture (which would make no sense, because if you ARE Christian then the rapture is nothing to fear in itself), mulled it over in their head and said ""Oh, well, maybe there's a way to absolve my sins in the afterlife! I can kill myself and my kids no problem!!""

No. It wouldn't happen like that. A Christian person, who has no reason to fear the Rapture whatsoever, would not justify committing a mortal sin by saying ""Well maybe I can atone later in the afterlife even though that's never explicitly stated in my religious texts.""

I take no issue in arguing with you as long as you have an argument, but you don't. If you think of any actual facts and not random deflections to other things, that's great, but until then I'm not going to argue this anymore.","1306889932"

It has more college graduates per capita than any country in the Middle East (this is significant since Israel is immediately surrounded by 22 Arab countries that are 640 times bigger than the Jewish State). It produces more scientific papers per capita than any other nation: 109 per 10,000 people. Its citizens hold more patents per person than do citizens of any other nation. If you use a computer, cell phone, text messaging or voice mail, you’re likely using technology first developed in Israel. For more on why Israel matters, visit our site.

Fast forward to Arab countries. Arab countries don’t allow freedom of speech, religion, voting &amp; sexual orientation. Saudi Arabia arrests women for driving. Egypt conducts “virginity checks on female protesters.” Libya is accused of raping and libeling women. Iran hangs homosexuals on a regular basis and has earned the top slot for world leader in child executions. Afghanistan is known for marrying and beating child brides. Palestinians have assassinated those suspected of helping Israel.","1306889958"

I later realized that this might be particularly due to the lower (by observation only) number of kids in urban vs suburban groups of friends, but it's definitely a phenomenon, anyway.

There are only two children in my own network of friends, but they are NEVER without a babysitter, have dozens of ""aunts"" and ""uncles"", and are welcomed as junior members of the group to all events that aren't strictly child-unfriendly.

The TLDR I got from hours of browsing awhile ago was that in the UK, you could cover the entire island with wind/solar/nuclear plants and still come up short to the current energy demands and that in addition to these technologies we're either going to have to increase how efficient everything is drastically or drastically reduce energy usage.","1306889969"

"PHP","t5_2qh38","I'd need to play around a bit to make sure this works, but this should be an option if MySQL has a string aggregation function that will roll up rows to a list.  I know I've been able to find custom functions for Oracle and SQL Server that do it.

What I would do would be to join the student and student's classes table together to get a list of the classes the student completed, grouping by student's ID and name.  I'd then do the same to the classes and class_requirements table, grouping by class_id and class_name.  I'd then join these two queries together with a subquery, joining them where the two lists of a student's completed classes is equal to the list of the classes requirements.  It would look something like this:

    SELECT	s.id, s.student_name, to_list(scc.class_id) as completed_classes
    FROM	students s
    JOIN	student_classes_completed scc ON s.id=scc.student_id
    JOIN	(
                     SELECT 	c.class_id, c.class_name, to_list(cr.requires_class_id) as required_classes
                     FROM 	classes c
                     JOIN 	class_requirements cr ON c.class_id=cr.class_id
                     GROUP BY c.class_id, c.class_name
              ) requirements
           ON 	to_list(scc.student_id)=requirements.required_classes
    GROUP BY s.id, s.student_name

You'd probably have to find a string aggregation function that will order the value within it.  You should be able to find something online to do it and then you'll just build it as a custom or user-defined function in MySQL.  You also don't need to the completed_classes portion in the initial select, but I would keep it in there just to see what's going on as I was building the two queries.

I've never had to work much with MySQL, but know it has its limitations.  Hopefully it'll allow something similar to what I've described as it should be what you're looking for.  The query will be pretty slow though due to the function and subquery.","1306890002"

And, personally, I feel like the connection between the artist and the audience is much harder to create these days since the human element of hand-drawn animation is completely absent from children's movies.  It sucks!  Even more shows on TV use flash animation with static limbs and character charts that reduce the amount of creativity in animation to absolute zero.  

I'm not sure, but Lilo &amp; Stitch is the last 2D animated film that comes to my mind, and I think it's made a bigger impression in animation than all the computer animated quick-buck movies made in the past decade.  Hopefully people will realize that 2D animation can still be successful if it's treated with the same care that Pixar films have been.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My friends and I used to sneak out of our houses a lot and go on late night/early morning walks around when we were 15/16. The easiest way to get into the next suburb where there was a lot more awesome shit was through a very dimly lit path, with a fenced off bush land on one side and a sound barrier on the other. In other words, a very long creepy as fuck path with little light and no where to run. 

Coming home from one of these walks one night, as we got into the path we saw a car in the distance shining a light around and eventually at us. We thought nothing of it - probably just cops, and we weren't doing anything wrong. Turns out it wasn't. 

As we got to the end of the path the car was sitting there. The bombed out brown shit box. Definitely not cops. Just as we thought we might have to turn back, some guy jumped over the fence by the bush land and landed behind us. Then three guys appeared in front of us; one was brandishing a pitchfork, another a sledgehammer, and the last had some chains and random tools. 

My friend - not exactly a big guy, but tall at least - stood in front of us ready to take the fall (heroic, non?). Thankfully, as he stepped a little further into the light, the attackers recognized him and put their weapons down. They were pretty friendly after that. 

Turned out that someone had called the lead guys little sister a slut after fucking her, or something, and they had gone to his house to bash him (although, they said ""kill""). He ran, and they were out looking for him. 

I remember him saying ""It's a good thing I saw who you were, man. I was about to fucking kill you."" 

**TL;DR: Ran into a bunch of people carrying weapons on a small dim path with no escape, almost got mistaken for someone who they were out to kill.**  ","1306890031"

Should your guy be stationary? Quick travel is nice in some games, but they usually give you things to do along the way. Horse travel was meh in AC, but that horse goes a million miles an hour. Dead Space is in space and on a ship so the only place to go is point A or point B . . . maybe even C. In AC on the way to a mission, there are civilians to help, viewpoints to scale, etc. Games are getting a lot better with travel. Fallout has fast travel which I use, but sometimes not, because a whole bunch of random encounters could occur if you walk to your destination. Red Dead Redemption has wagons to take you from town to town, but there's people to save, criminals to take down, people to duel, and mini missions along the way. **My point** is that when I play an older game, I try to remember how new or old it is and think about other games out at that time and compare it to that. AC was giving the freerunning assassin thing a try. Dead Space was putting out an intense survival horror game in space. They were pretty unique at the time they came out.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","After reading just half the thread (tl;drr) I've got my two cents to be overlooked. 

- I have no experience because I can't find a job. 
Experience is the easiest thing to get. Whatever career you want to go into (example: tech) then start out by learning as much as you can. The internet is your best friend with the worlds resources at your fingertips. Once you got a grasp on it start out by helping friends and family (or breaking and fixing your own stuff). You can leverage that in a future interview by citing specific times you were able to utilize your skill set to fix a problem. 

-I can't find a job because I have no experience
So you've got the experience thing taken care of. Great. The next step is realizing that life works in mysterious ways. For example: I can spend 15 minutes writing and re-writing this post so it can be ignored, but you just never know. My time as a sales person at Petco and loading beer on trucks for Budweiser has lead to knowing more contacts that lead to finding my current job. At the end of day it's more important to keep a roof over your head, food in your belly and the bills paid. Throw yourself out there for jobs you're not crazy about (manual labor? chucking newspapers?)

 It's amazing how your mindset changes once you have a job you want to leave as opposed to wanting a job you don't have. ","1306890052"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Ironic you should say that.  Islam considers atheism amongst the hight of arrogance. 

That is, atheism is just another religion/creed whose followers are committing shirk just the same.  Instead of replacing god with some idol they are replacing him with the Ego. With the self.  They are the center of their own world and their whims are effectively worshiped.   For example, Pharaoh is considered amongst the highest of arrogant individuals since he literally believed himself a demi-god amongst men. (Obviously I don't mean this for every single atheist out there; but it does seem to hold for strong/positive atheists). 

No offense, but it sounds like a circular statement.  Since you don't believe in a divine source (and you also think you're right without a doubt), you think muslims have arrogance for claiming a divine source for the Quran because you don't believe in a divine source.

If the professor teaches well, and the students learn and study, then 100% should be the received score.  If a student is receiving 25% and getting an A, then you are either not teaching well, your students are not studying and learning well, or your test is not a good one.

Thus, a bell curve should not be necessary.  So, in the liberal arts, either the professors are better, the students are better, or the tests are better.","1306890076"

Rhymesayers is at the base of the Minneapolis/Midwest hip hop explosion over the past 15 years. P.O.S/Doomtree, Mac Lethal/Black Clover Records, Brother Ali, Eyedea &amp; Abilities, Blueprint and MF DOOM are some of the artists that are currently or formerly signed to Rhymesayers. I was unaware of Dynospectrum until just now, but wikipedia had my back. It was a group, in the loosest sense of the word, which included Slug, Ant, and one of their Rhymesayers co-founders, Beyond (Musab), as well as others.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; I don't think a majority of the opposition to his policies is because he was black

I think there's a fair share of opposition to Obama that has nothing to do with his policies.  The Affordable Care Act was *Bob Dole's* health care plan back in '96.  The Birth Certificate conspiracy has absolutely nothing to do with Obama's political agenda, either.  It's purely a fabrication of anti-black and anti-immigrant sentiment.

I wish we could focus more on policy, but the witch doctor photos and the kool-aid / fried chicken / watermelon photo shop jobs and the conspiracy theories and the backhanded slurs (Rush's stirring rendition of Barack the Magic Negro - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_the_Magic_Negro) don't touch policy at all.

&gt; and a large part of that was his race. He got black voters mobilized as all hell, if nothing else.

The numbers tell a different story.  Democrats typically draw the black vote in the 90%+ percentage and Obama didn't particularly outperform Kerry or Gore.  Obama's GOTV operation was exceptionally good, but it was as good among college students and urban professionals and independent voters, irregardless of race.

Had Obama been white, he'd still be the same passionate, articulate, progressive candidate so many people supported.  I don't see any evidence that race moved his poll numbers.

&gt; Meh, even when he tries, he fails. Look at the recent kerfluffle over Israel.

Really?  You're going to use the 1000 year old conflict that Obama failed to resolve in 3 years of office as proof that his foreign policy has failed?  If that's your litmus test, we haven't had a successful foreign policy in all of American history.

&gt; Jobs are up, but not as much as population growth, and unemployment claims are still rising. If we used the same metrics as the Reagan administration, inflation would be over 10%, and unemployment hovering around 20%.

That makes no sense whatsoever.  Jobs are *up*, as opposed to *down*.  That's a vast improvement from January '09 when we were hemorrhaging millions of jobs a year.  Inflation isn't over 10%.  Unemployment isn't anywhere near 20%.  I'm not sure what these ""Reagan metrics"" are, but they have nothing to do with reality.

&gt; That ""uncertain business climate"" has not dissipated at all

Wall Street disagrees with you, to the tune of about 4500 points on the DOW.

&gt; His stimulus program was an utter failure, the unemployment rate is worse than his projection with no stimulus

His projections were wrong.  That doesn't mean his stimulus program was a failure at all.  The Detroit auto industry went from billion dollar deficits to billion dollar profits.  Housing prices stabilized.  And we haven't had another Lehman Brothers to date.  Employment *is* up, ""Reagan metrics"" be damned.  GDP is *growing* not shrinking.

&gt; Neither fixed a single problem

?!  Do you even know what the problems were?  Bankruptcies.  Lots of bankruptcies.  Are these firms still going bankrupt?  No?  Then clearly the problem was fixed.

&gt; How about rearranging our healthcare system so that at any point, anyone actually considers cost versus quality? 

Pitch a proposal, then.  Put forward a plan that covers the maximum number of people at a minimum cost.  The Affordable Care Act tackles that problem - it drives down costs and increases insurance enrollment.  No other legislation to date has come close to closing the insurance gap or reducing health care overhead.

&gt; Hell, I'd settle for ending the pathetic facade that our system in any way whatsoever resembles a market, much less a free one.

Perhaps you would.  But ""get rid of all health care in the US and start from scratch"" isn't a popular political position right now.  I doubt your legislation would pass.

&gt; But between the power of the bully pulpit, and the utter feckless cowardice on congressmen in defending their powers from the executive branch, I don't know that that's the case anymore.

The GOP Senate filibustered over 300 bills between '09 and '11.  That is three times more filibusters than at any other year in history.  They dragged the entire federal government to a halt.  Oooooh, but the President has the *bully pulpit*.  He can call a Press Conference and be on TV for 30 minutes.

The Congressmen haven't given up jack shit for power.  You don't see Boehner rolling over to Obama's budget demands.  You don't see Senator McConnell signing off on judicial nominees left and right.  Congress maintains its grip on power when it chooses to.

Congress matters.  The question is whether Congress matters **to you, the voter** or whether you'll keep aiming at and blaming the guy in the Oval Office as though he single-handedly rules the world.","1306890083"

In fact, many, many foods contain compounds that are, to some degree (and of course, in the proper context) ""toxic"" (I use the term as loosely as possible). When you read a claim that ""this product contains ___ and is therefore toxic/dangerous/unhealthy"" you must consider the fact that that the dose makes the poison (IIRC Paracelsus said it first: Sola dosis facet venenum). He doesn't make any mention as to how much ammonia is present, which is the deciding factor. Nonetheless, from that man's answer:
&gt;According to the Times, the FDA has signed off on the use of ammonia in meat, concluding that it is safe when used as a processing agent in foods.

All of this is besides the point, since if you needed a reason to cease consuming fast food burgers, you need look no further than the sheer number of calories. A McDonald's  cheeseburger contains 300kcal ([source](http://www.mcdonalds.ca/NutritionCalculator/index_en.html)) and is hardly satiating (for me personally, anyway I would require at a minimum of two). 

I'm not trying to defend Mickey D's by any means, I think many of the people I know frequent the restaurant all too often. But once in a while, a greasy burger hits the spot.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;  Four thousand years before Christ, Sumerian women created the divine drink of beer. Viking women brewed in Norse society. European Ale Wives were so successful as cottage brewers they were taxed. Artisanal women lost their domination of the daily ritual of brewing during the Industrial Revolution. Today's brewing trade is controlled by men. The collaboration of two Craft companies both led by women, New Glarud Brewing and Wyermann Malting, is unique. You hold the result ""Two Women"" a Classic Country Lager brewed with Weyermann's floor malted Bohemian malt and Hallertau Mittelfrueh hops. A tempting and graceful classic lager found...

"books","t5_2qh4i","I had no intention of resolving any debate. I only meant to encourage him to think both as a philosopher and as a scientist. You're absolutely right about Stat Mech and things like the Equipartition Theorem and all that do work like how you said. It was all meant to be more in spirit than literally, I suppose. I encourage my fellow scientists to think philosophically as well as scientifically. I don't think having a one-track mind is a good thing. I often run into problems in Physics when other physicists are very afraid to ask ""why"" because it is not ""in the province of Science."" They're right, insofar as I would not submit a ""why"" paper to Nature... but it's good, I think, for overall intellectual development to ask any kind of question, even if it's beyond the field's strictest definitions. It's also fun.

You have to cut me some slack, it was 5 AM here when I wrote that after a night of Reddit instead of sleep, so it might not even be terribly coherent. I assure you I certainly did not mean to resolve the free-will debate in favor of the affirmative. That debate will probably never be resolved. I merely wanted to encourage asking the deep questions and thinking in different ways.

Also, I freely admit to a bias. I find the ideas of von Mises and Hayek so much to my liking that when I think of Economics I immediately think of Praxeology and Catallactics.

I would never deny her any favor she needed, she lived by herself at 16 and didn't have a car so I would give her a ride to the vet or the laundry, and we would talk and talk about everything and it always was a pleasure to help her. Then it started to get out of hand. She would only talk to me if she needed something, she even started to ask me for money and groceries, and I understood it was hard for her to live by herself but it wasn't the same since then, she wouldn't even say a word to me all day, just a thanks at the end of the day.

I felt depressed for a while because I thought she was only using me, and one day I confronted her and told her how I was feeling and she said that I was a selfish asshole and that she couldn't believe I thought of her like that, and since then she hasn't answered the phone or let me go to her house.

It was very hard for me because she was my only friend, and to think she just used me for her ends, always gets me in a deep depression.

TL;DR: a girl I thought was my best friend was only using me for rides and food, and she doesn't want to speak to me because I told her I felt used.","1306890124"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was drinking in a dorm room with a few friends.  At about two A.M. two of them decided to find some females to bring back.  We continue drinking for about 30 minutes or so, and then start to worry that they had lost their way, being the drunkest of the bunch.  So we go out looking for them completely tanked.  As we are stumbling across campus, we start to hear shouting and pounding footsteps from between the two buildings in front of us.

Cue said lost friends sprinting out of the ally.  One's shirt was tattered up to his right elbow, and his arm was bloody.  As soon as the other saw us, he screams ""FUCKING RUN!!"" and two police officers come tearing ass out of the ally behind them.  Most of us were underage at the time, so we quickly turned tail and fled.  The ensuing chase led us in a big circle around campus, through ever shortcut, tunnel, and ally we knew of.  We ended up losing the cops by doubling back through a series of alleyways.

When we got back, we learned that the two did indeed get lost, and in the process one tripped and put his hand through the window of a parked car in full view of two cops.  I realized the next day that the cops would have never stopped chasing them to harass me for underage drinking, so I really shouldn't have been a part of that.  Damn liquor.  Great memory though.","1306890124"

Now that I live in the city and they're all around I try to frequent them as much as possible.  I go to the local grocery store, avoid the chain near my work, and frequent the many amazing local restaurants in my neighborhood.  There's this one little kebab place that has the most amazing Afghan takeout.  I try to visit this place at least once a week because it's so good and even if I'm not particularly in the mood, it still beats McDonalds by a mile and I'd be really upset if they went out of business due to lack of customers.  I've got my friend hooked on their kebabs now and he'll drive out of his comfort zone to get it.

However I still see the appeal of the big chains.  When I'm driving somewhere I'm not familiar with I'll often find myself in a chain because I know what to expect.  When you're in an unfamiliar place this can be a very powerful feeling and that comfort will often override any desire to support the little guy.  I imagine this phenomena is especially powerful in a country like mine (USA) where things tend to be very far apart.","1306890127"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was about 17 I was coming down from skiing on Mt. Hood, I was feeling sciencey so I threw my car in neutral and coasted because I wanted to see if I could go the whole stretch (around 25 miles) in neutral.
At one point I was coming up on a long flat but curvy stretch so I was trying to build up speed, and when I looked down I was going between 90 and 95 mph. At precisely this moment I come around a corner and pass a cop, who slams on his brakes and actually slammed so hard he went a little off the side of the road. It was a pretty narrow two lane highway and it was taking him a while to turn around, and he hadn't flipped on his lights yet so I thought I'd keep going until he did. I was around the corner and came up to a turn for another ski resort so I turned up the road and parked in the lot for a half hour or so. Eventually I saw a convoy of snowmobilers with huge lifted pickups and giant trailers heading out so I decided to plop myself in the middle of them and hope for the best.
We get about 5 miles down the road and there were two cop cars, one on either side of the road. One had his radar gun out and the other was kneeling beside the road (I'm not sure why, I can't imagine them using a spike strip for speeding, and I can't think of another reason for him to be kneeling.).
It's kind of a lame story but it's the only time I've ever ""ran"" from the cops and escaped.","1306890129"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Here are is reference to one study, based in Jamaica, that was fairly large and extensive:

http://patients4medicalmarijuana.wordpress.com/2009/12/20/marijuana-cannabis-use-in-pregnancy-dr-melanie-dreher/

- further on the study referenced above: http://www.ccrmg.org/journal/06spr/dreher.html

Here is a breakdown of the studies available re: cannabis in pregnancy  http://www.mothering.com/pregnancy-birth/use-of-marijuana-during-pregnancy  (they have a great, comprehensive list of sources at the end of the article that are easily referenced)

I think it's interesting that when women are pregnant we demonize them for drinking an occasional glass of wine or beer, sitting in a hot tub, eating sushi, etc. When we should really be concerned about the prescription drugs that women are casually given during pregnancy (everything from Phenegren for nausea to Percocet for back pain) and the narcotics given *during labor* that are seen as ""safe"".

When you look at the risk/benefit ratio of certain medications during pregnancy, you have to consider cannabis for some of the ailments we are prescribing more dangerous medications to women for.  i.e., antinausea/antiemitic drugs are generally NOT THAT SAFE for pregnancy, definitely much more risky than cannabis, and most don't work nearly as well.  (These drugs knock a mother out and may quell her nausea for a bit, but they certainly won't increase appetite like cannabis will - something that is a BENEFIT to a woman with severe hyperemesis/morning  sickness.)

I get tired of pregnant women being treated like children under the public domain. The War on Drugs has tried repeatedly to PROVE that cannabis is DANGEROUS in pregnancy and they cannot provide solid studies to back it up.  ""Might be harmful"" is a wide term and one that applies to ibuprofen, most antidepressants, antianxiety meds, etc.

What we DO know is that it's more the route of delivery (smoking vs tincture or eating) that poses SOME risk, but even then it's very very small.

What about women that eat at McDonald's every day while they're pregnant?  Women that consume large amounts of soda?  Candy?  Women that smoke a couple cigarettes a day? Women who are injected with heavy narcotics right before their babies are born as pain relief in labor?  These situations pose far more risk to unborn babies than cannabis.

I think there is a fine line between the punitive attitude about what pregnant women should/should not be doing and an informed public.  Why is it hard to imagine that the information we've been fed over the last 30 years re: cannabis in pregnancy be skewed to exaggerate harm?  With what we know to be true about cannabis in general, it is that hard of a stretch to imagine that there might be very little, if any, harm to a developing fetus?  Of course, if you were to do a general Google search, the vast majority of links are going to be pointing to old or flawed studies (if they cite at all) that say NO NO NO NO NO!  This is to be expected in our current culture regarding litigation in pregnancy/birth, control over women's bodies during childbearing, and the War on Drugs.

tl;dr:  Overwhelming solid studies show that cannabis in and of itself does not lend to higher birth complications/fetal anomolies. The mode of administration and other lifestyle factors (smoking cigarettes, poor nutrition, low socioeconomic status, use of other drugs) may impact cannabis use in pregnancy, but the studies are available that show it's not as harmful as many other substances women blindly consume daily during pregnancy and during birth.","1306890133"

I suspect some connection between the fact that I am blind in one eye (ambliopia, so both eyes work the brain just ignores one) and me having trouble with visualization and image recall. 

Comsic consciousness comes easier for me. I can surrender to the experience and non judgmentally allow it to happen. My mind fills with colors and fractals and it is a lot like going under anesthesia. One moment your awake and lucid and then you are just gone. I feel expanded, connected, concepts and images stream into me and I could really just stay there. 

I think connecting cosmically is easier for me because I don't have to do anything, just experience it. For some reason I put a lot of pressure on myself regarding astral projection. Again, I was told it was intentional (by myself of course) so I guess I have some more work to do.

No it does not.  While I admit my bias wants me to believe her analysis is correct I'm too intellectually honest for that. I will however continue to bring her analysis up because Vegetarians love the data she is working with, and thus those who are intellectually honest themselves will change their thinking.  I'm not asking anyone change the way they eat, but hopefully they will realize that there isn't actually evidence that a vegetarian diet is better than a diet with low junk food that includes meat - not to be confused with the standard diet that includes junk food (I intentionally did not define junk food because while everyone agrees it exists we don't have agreement on what exactly is junk).

Minger did what looks like a good analysis of the data.  If you want to attack her work that is fine. However all I'm seeing is ad hominem attacks on her person, not on the work she has done. This indicates a logical fallacy on your part, and re-enforces my thinking that her work is correct - if it was not you would do the analysis yourself and point out why it is wrong.

We might be able to break into positive productivity if we didn't spend so much time training them up and assigning them real coding work.

Movies, like music, theatre, etc. can be an incredible insightful or moving art form, but I'd argue more often than not they have been simply a means to entertain and make money. 

Why do you think Family Guy is one of the more popular shows on television, it literally is a series of ""unrelated sort of funny moments"", and the same can be said of many shows and movies. 

You claim that people who want to be purely entertained (who don't give a shit about quality of writing or mise-en-scene) are what's wrong with your business? It's fucking Hollywood, they are your business! Lowest common denominator entertainment creates a situation financially where real artistic projects can now be funded, where actors can now afford to take a pay cut to do a better film (which has a smaller budget anyway because less people want to see quality than strings of explosions or dick and fart jokes.)

Seriously, I can sympathize with being annoyed by hugely popular films that I perceive to be crap, but saying, ""Hey average joe, you shouldn't want cheap entertainment, you need to appreciate this as art!"" Fuck that shit. If you appreciate the mere existence of the industry you work in, you should probably be thankful of those people.

With regards to your question about tolerating chemo, you misunderstand the primary mechanism of weight loss in most cancer patients.  While nausea and vomiting are commonly associated with many conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, the majority of weight loss from advanced cancer is felt to be due to a metabolic problem (cachexia).  When patients become so sick from chemo that they lose weight, we will usually reduce the chemo dose to make the effects more tolerable, rather than keep going at such high doses.

With regards to umbapumba's comment, we really try hard to avoid needing to feed a patient with a tube or parenterally, unless it's absolutely unavoidable (i.e. esophageal cancer), because most studies have shown that parenteral and tube feedings don't do a lot to prolong life in cancer patients.","1306890172"

"chess","t5_2qhr7","I don't like your second move. It basically locks your dark-squared Bishop in a useless position for the foreseeable future. I think it also caused you to push the b-pawn to try and extricate that Bishop, which was part of why his Queen made your life a little unpleasant for a while: if that b-pawn hadn't moved then it would have been defending your Knight and that whole thing probably would have been a nonissue. 

Move the Bishop first, then push that pawn to get the other one out. You were lucky that he decided to trade his strong Knight for that worthless Bishop later on, although really you both had plenty of worthless pieces that should have been better positioned at that point. (This is common among beginners.)

Sometimes you do have to make a pawn move like this, (Black does in one variation of the Queen's Gambit, 1.d4 d5 2. c4 e6, for instance) but here there was no reason. Your d-pawn didn't need defending; the chief advantage of 1. d4 as opposed to 1. e4 is that the Queen protects that pawn, making it hard to attack. And if he did attack it, say with a Pawn, there would be plenty of time for you to defend. Black's second move was questionable for the same reason, but at least it wasn't quite so counterproductive (although his Knight might have liked to use that square).

Your attacking play later on was good, but it would have been nice to bring your other pieces into it. You missed lots of opportunities to do this; one example that jumps out at me is move 35 where you could have played Bxh5 with check. Not that check is anything special in and of itself, but if you can use it to bring up reinforcements while he has no time to regroup, that's even better than bringing up reinforcements with quiet moves. Which would still have been worthwhile. 

Finally, SenseiCAY is right: be careful and don't give things away. Your opponent's willingness to give up his Queen for a Rook for no reason gave you a game-winning advantage, and then you lost the game by giving your Queen away. These were the defining moments of the game; I'd say every other mistake you made pales in comparison, not counting tactical opportunities you didn't notice. (I think the third biggest mistake was the fact that you two didn't develop your pieces well, so for much of the game you were playing without those as well). No point dwelling on this too much, but I'd probably be remiss if I didn't mention that more practice will really help you more than anything I tell you. Tactics study too; we can give you some links if you would be interested in this.","1306890185"

I was just making a suggestion. The FACT remains that the people DID kill themselves, and their children, BECAUSE OF THEIR BELIEFS. How can YOU argue this? (There were the same stories in EUTimes and CNN, if you need your ""reliable sources""). If these people were sensible adults with clear heads, most likely they would be believing this shit anyways.

How do Christians in the military go about killing and everything is hunky dory? I guess they are just not religious? Right? How do they murder another person even though their faith says its a deadly sin.

One day, we were in the store looking at all the stuff we wouldn't buy (King Cobra, Twinkies, pork skins, etc) and one of the members of the family who owns the store asked us what we'd buy if they carried it.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I hate to admit it but we did the same thing and it worked.  My 3 year old son went through a major ""power struggle"" phase and my efforts to give him choices, time-outs, explain rules, talk about feelings, etc. were not working so my husband decided to try locking him in his room as punishment.  I wasn't very comfortable with it but I didn't know what else to do.  It only took a couple of times for him to get the message that his bad behavior wasn't going to be tolerated.

The first time he (the 3 year old) freaked out (not terrified, just very mad and upset) so my husband checked on him every couple of minutes and asked if he was ready to stop crying and talk... my son would yell, ""NO!"" and the door was closed again.  He continued until my son finally gave in and said, ""I'm ready.""

The next day, my husband tried the tactic again and after about a minute my son came to the door and called out, ""Come back, I'm ready!""  They talked about the behaviour and that was that.

He still misbehaves occasionally but it is manageable now (by removing the priviledge/toy he is abusing).  We don't have the power struggle issues and haven't had to lock his door again.  However, the lock is still on his door if it ever comes to that again.

We still have a time-out chair in his room but don't close the door when we use it.  My son has an awesome bedroom and loves it.  He sleeps well and plays in his room by himself all the time.","1306890200"

I'm not sure why I think the one is more intimate than the other--maybe because with a blowjob, the giver is still a certain distance from the recipient.  With cunnilingus, the parts in question are flush to the rest of the woman's body, forcing more closeness. Also, the positioning: I'd say that the positions for blowjobs are a lot less vulnerable than those for cunnilingus.    

As a woman, I would definitely reject this stranger's offer, because sexual activity is so mental for me. If I didn't know and trust this person, I wouldn't be comfortable/relaxed enough during the act to enjoy it at all.","1306890202"

This also provides you vital info about its whereabouts in case you're hiding from it. You then wait for an opportunity to run at the vehicle at an angle perpendicular to its motion -- you'll want to arrive at the enemy vehicle's side or back. Attach two C4s, run in the direction opposite of the tank's movement, count two Mississippis, and enjoy your kill!

Edit: [Diagram of how to do that](http://i.imgur.com/tlPbW.png). Note that this doesn't work too well if the tank driver is smart enough to allow his machine gunner to lay down fire in the direction opposite the main cannon. From my experience though, most tank drivers either don't have a machine gunner or start shooting at the machine gun's current target instead of letting the other guy cover the main cannon's blind spots.","1306890211"

"audio","t5_2qhms","Hmm 6 hours, no comments, I'll see what I can do if you still want help. Given your budget, you may be putting too much emphasis on ""matching"". There is no reason to switch out your polk sub for another one just because the brand name matches, especially for a sub which will add little coloration to the sound anyway. Plus the polk sub is a good one. 

You should definitely look into getting some rear speakers, and again, you don't necessarily need them to match perfectly, just find some that are in your price range and that you think sound nice. If they happen to be a pair of paradigm's, that's great. 

One route you could go if you want to ""match"", since you have the polk sub already and a BB gift card, you could get Polk rear speakers (just their bookshelf's) and maybe down the road get a polk center and fronts. (this is assuming you even like the polk sound). That would eventually lead you to a matched system, but as I said before, I don't personally think this is necessary unless you have a higher end system. 

So with $200 You could get a pair of really nice rear speakers and save whatever you have left over, then just live with the 5 channel system for a bit and then make a decision what needs improvement next (probably the fronts). You can upgrade in steps and tailor the sound over a longer period of time.","1306890213"

I do disagree with your reasoning against satire. Often satire is used as a surreptitious method of attacking a paradigm without explicitly stating so, occasionally, where one doesn't have the freedom to do so. For example, were an Iranian satirist to find prominence taking a cleverly-disguised, controversial stance against their domestic regime, I could see that as a potentially valuable and thought-provoking case for inclusion.","1306890245"

No matter how you use it, there's a current societal connection between ""faggot"" and homosexuality, and there's no avoiding that connection for the time being.

That person is responsible for finding the customer's books, answering phone calls, and placing orders on top of returning any misplaced books to their proper locations and straightening the shelves for the opening crew.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Here's my first stab at an implementation, and bear with me I'm posting this only to get an idea across, I haven't actually run any of the code below; and you've probably already considered something similar but I'll put it out there anyway:

MSIL-&gt;JS generated code doesn't get access a jsobject that contains the struct data itself; it's instead given access to a 'handle' object that contains a prototype containing the compiled implementation of the methods on the struct, as well as getter and setter methods that are used instead of allowing direct field access to any non-private fields on the struct.

The handle object, internally consists of two pieces of state: a reference to an underlying jsobject that actually contains the state data of the struct, and a flag that indicates whether this handle has a private underlying object or if it's been shared with another handle.

The handle object also has a clone method, which creates a new handle pointing to the same underlying jsobject, and sets the 'private' flag on both handles to false.

All the methods on the handle object that mutate the underlying struct data first perform a check -- if the handle's private flag is not set, then the underlying jsobject is memberwise-cloned, and the handle is updated to reference that new clone instead; and the private flag on the handle is set to true.   If the handle's private flag is set, then nothing needs to happen and the method can run as normal.

A quick example, given the C# struct:

    struct MyStruct
    {
        string A;
        public string B;

        public void C(string value)
        {
            this.A = value;
        }

        public string D()
        {
            return this.A + "" "" + this.B;
        }
    }

Codegen the struct to javascript as something similar to the following:

    var MyStruct$State = function() {
        this.A = null;
        this.B = null;
    }
    MyStruct$State.prototype.$clone = function() {
        var result = new MyStruct$State();
        result.A = this.A;
        result.B = this.B;
        return result;
    }

    var MyStruct$Handle = function() {
    }
    MyStruct$Handle.createNew = function() {
        var result = new MyStruct$Handle();
        result.$_state = new MyStruct$State();
        result.$_private = true;
        return result;
    }
    MyStruct$Handle.prototype.$clone = function() {
        var result = new MyStruct$Handle();
        result.$_state = this.$_state;
        result.$_private = false;
        this.$_private = false;
        return result;
    }
    MyStruct$Handle.prototype.$_makePrivate = function () {
        if (this.$_private == false) {
            this.$_state = this.$_state.$clone();
            this.$_private = true;
        }
    }
    MyStruct$Handle.prototype.get$B = function () {
        return this.$_state.B;
    }
    MyStruct$Handle.prototype.set$B = function (value) {
        this.$_makePrivate();
        this.$_state.B = value;
    }
    MyStruct$Handle.prototype.C = function (value) {
        this.$_makePrivate();
        this.$_state.A = value;
    }
    MyStruct$Handle.prototype.D = function () {
        // does not mutate the struct, no call to $_makePrivate necessary
        return this.$_state.A + "" "" + this.$_state.B;
    }

And as for the call site, codegen the following C# code:

    void Test()
    {
        MyStruct s1 = new MyStruct();
        s1.B = ""hello"";
        s1.C(""world"");

        MyStruct s2 = s1;
        s2.B = ""goodbye cruel"";

        Console.WriteLine(s1.D());
        Console.WriteLine(s2.D());
    }

To something similar to the following:

    function Test() {
        var s1 = Struct$Handle.createNew();
        s1.set$B(""hello"");
        s1.C(""world"");

        var s2 = s1.$clone();
        s2.set$B(""goodbye cruel"");

        Console.WriteLine(s1.D());
        Console.WriteLine(s2.D());
    }

You reduce the amount of data updated on a struct copy to just the reference copy and a set of two private flags; and still retain the ability to implement copy-on-write because the swapping out of the struct state is done *within* the handle rather than outside of it at the true call site.

The cost of doing double-indirection (callsite-&gt;handle-&gt;state) on each access to the struct might make the whole idea infeasible, though.","1306890279"

"Diablo","t5_2qore","It all depends on how Blizzard makes D3 IMO.  They really shit the bed bigtime with patch 1.10 because it made items which require infeasably rare runes, thus the only practical way to get them is to bot.  If in Diablo 3 they do the same thing and make items that have a 1/200k chance of dropping necessesary to be competitive, then there will be bots.  If they structure the end game in a better way then D2 (which I'm sure they will seeing as the endgame of WoW is not nearly as stacked as D2), then botting will probably still exist but it won't give the edge to the botters to anywhere near the degree that it does in D2.

In D2 the difference between someone who is playing legit and someone who is botting is just massive.  In a PvP situation you will get 1 shotted in most situations if you are the average legitimate player.","1306890287"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","On failed hockey markets, here's my take on Atlanta.

I'm what Atlanta natives call a *transplant*. I moved to Atlanta in 1997 from the Midwest and I've been a lifelong, die-hard hockey fan, player and evangelist. When the Thrasher's expansion was announced and the marketing campaigns began, guess who the organization **didn't** have to worry about attracting to the *new* sport? People like me! And there are lots of us here in Atlanta. Lots. (ok, maybe there's only 200 of us now, judging by the size of the tailgate party at Philips a few weekends ago... but let me explain)

The early marketing in Atlanta had success attracting new fans. The team broke records for NHL expansion attendance. Things were looking good.

Then, Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari; killing fan-favorite Dan Snyder just weeks before the start of the season. Suddenly, the prospects of a successful season for the burgeoning franchise were lost in the mangled remains of a sports car on the pavement of an upscale Atlanta neighborhood.

Along comes Atlanta Spirit who made no pretense of having interest in owning the Thrashers; they were hard-core basketball fans. The Thrasher's were their little red-headed step child.

After the Spirit took over, we had the lockout. One whole season lost. The season after the lockout? Dany Heatley demands a trade.

It's at this point that Atlanta Spirit start in-fighting and drawn-out litigation over a proposed trade with their darling Atlanta Hawks and so begins the inevitable descent into madness. The wind in the Thrashers' sails disappeared. The spectre of uncommitted, incompetent ownership and tightening purse strings plagued the team. High-profile players began to leave en masse. Casual fans stopped paying attention and a few die-hard fans decided to boycott the Atlanta Spirit for its ineptitude and unwillingness to invest in its hockey team.
 
We're now in 2011. 7 years after the Atlanta Spirit took the helm. The team operated at league minimum salary since 2007; players have abandoned the franchise repeatedly, citing, sometimes publicly, concerns about ownership and the future of the franchise.

You can point fingers at us Atlanta fans for being fair-weather (I'd prefer to say we're judicious with our entertainment dollars, especially when the proprietor of said entertainment shows public disdain for its patrons and refuses to peddle a quality product), but the fact of the matter is the Atlanta Spirit killed this franchise. Some will even claim its demise was intentional so the Spirit clowns could more easily dump their hockey team and get back to what they love - Basketball.

So, from all the Thrashers fans in Atlanta,

**FUCK. YOU. ATLANTA SPIRIT!!!**

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Neither Christianity, Judaism nor Islam force others into their beliefs.

Babies get baptized before they can make a choice. Children in religious families do not have a say in whether to listen to Christian indoctrination or not. They are sold religious beliefs as truths, including the concept of hell, sin, and sexuality being shameful. They are told that they are not divine and that ""god"" is something external that watches them all the time and will judge them based on a list of rules. Classic obedience conditioning.

And, let's not forget the massive number of people who were brutally tortured and killed because they wouldn't agree with the ridiculous claims of the religion.

&gt; It forms an elitist totalitarian society.

Every religion does that. The ones closer to the ""church"" have more power and say in important matters.

I'll leave the election to you. If you truly believe that electing the pope has anything to do with spirituality and not with political power instead, I have no arguments. It is amusing for me to see that people believe that this theater is real just because the costumes are so nice. Look at the faces under the fancy hats and you'll see demons in the flesh, corrupted to the depth of their beings.

&gt; Although I realize it can seem 'cool' to hate on religion, I wish more people realised that not all religious people are crazy extremists who only want creationism taught in schools (in fact, most if not all Christian people I know believe in evolution).

I dislike religion* because most of it betrays and twists the truth of its own origins, and rapes the souls and bodies of human children in order to achieve its power over them; I dislike it because it exterminated and continues to oppress the brightest and most courageous people; I dislike it because it turns people against each other in the name of love, thus twisting the meaning of the word beyond recognition; I hate it it because it makes people think they have answers to the misteries that require personal investigation and closes the doors for them to find their true divine nature. I dislike it because it is a manifestation of the very darkness it warns against.

""Christians"" ganged up in Cali and changed the law to prevent others from getting married. This is the typical movement of religious gangs/cults. Lies, hate, separation, exploitation, war. Not cool.

Nothing against you :)

*I feel grateful for the countless enlightened beings and teachers and beautiful lineages, including the ones practicing Christianity, Judaism, Sufism, etc. Each religion has its pocket of true seekers, the ones who practice the real teaching. You can spot them in history by the fact that they are usually exterminated as the ""officials'"" first order of business... as lies cannot coexist with the truth.","1306890310"

So I didn't want to do shit with this girl and my friend was in one of the rooms, not fucking yet but getting close. I decided it would be fun to throw my cat in the room. It was.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm not an American, but I do pay close attention to your politics. Here is my simplistic view on Ron Paul:

Ron Paul wants to basically completely abolish the federal government. This looks great to the younger generation because ""down with authority man"" is popular with that demographic.

What they miss, is that he is not anti-government. He is **pro-government**. He is just ""pro-state government"" versus pro-federal.

If a state wanted to give life sentences for pot possession or start their own drug war, Ron Paul is fine with that because it is done at the ""state level"". If a state wanted to remove all civil rights so companies can openly discriminate against minorities, he would be fine with that too. 

It's funny because with what power your states have now, they're already doing some pretty shocking things. And even with some strict regulations, corporations still find a way to screw up and corruption is already a big problem.

If Ron Paul's ideology was ever enacted, your country would fall, and fall hard. 

Thanks to your flawed two party voting system though, it's impossible that he'll get elected. There is no 1% chance, no .0001% chance, it's simply zero. Because of that, it wouldn't surprise me to find out that the GOP is astroturfing ""ron paul 2012"" on forums and communities to get that particular demographic to throw away their vote. It worked well enough with Nader. ","1306890314"

Basically, I just couldn't deal with the idea that bad things happen to good people, but I couldn't rationalize how humanity and the universe existed in the first place.  I had a vague notion of what evolution meant based on my (pitiful) high school biology class, but I couldn't conceive of life ""just coming to be"" or whatever.  So I figured there was a ""god"" or something.  Then I read *The Blind Watchmaker* and it all kind of made sense.  I think it was the description of the evolution of the eye that really made it click.  At that point it was like, ""Oh, well that's how it went down.

When his son (I'm assuming) takes over though (and Kim is dead), I have a feeling he will try to act like his father and grandfather but will probably end up making things worse. This is when we will probably begin to see the protests take place. Unfortunately, most will probably end up like Tienanmen Square until some government/military officials side with protesters. As much as I would like to see NK fix itself internally, I think international intervention would start here.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","* The GTX480 and the GTX570 are nearly identical performance wise. The only reason to get the GTX480 over the 570 would be for it's higher over-clocking potential and durability. If you're not doing that then you're essentially getting a hotter and more power hungry card for no reason because the 570 is overall a more efficient version of it. I have GTX480's and they get STUPID HOT and run very heavy on power. That being said I have them under water so now I can take full advantage of them.

* If you're looking for that power range, the 6950/6970 are really the better price vs performance cards at the moment. That being said I tend to stick with Nvidia myself regardless of the price vs performance differences. So I understand some of this may be personal preference for certain features.

* Depending on what you're doing, a 64gb SSD may feel very snug. I would recommend at least 128 (or two 64 in raid0) if you really want to be happy with it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This has nothing to do with rules of the road.  Insurance companies pay claims without police reports everyday.  Especially for minor accidents such as this.  ""At fault"" is always declared, and a citation will make proving ""at fault"" vs ""not at fault"" very easy.  If there is no police report, then both parties will under go recorded statements and if someone admits fault, it will hold up in court.

Insurance fraud happens everyday as well.  With minor claims, the companies do not care.  There is not an insurance company today with the man-power to investigate every instance of suspected fraud.  In a larger claim, say the vehicles were totaled and there were major injuries, and by some act of God there was no police report, then the insurance company would investigate the claim to determine who is at fault.  This includes recorded statements, examinations under oath, hell I've even seen a physicist called to a scene to determine the speed in which the car hit the tree prior to snapping in half.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","&gt;You would expect rape to skyrocket. There are more guys watching more porn more often. But, in fact, rape has gone down in America. Also, in Japan in the mid-'90s, they loosened their obscenity laws. Now rape is down there too. It certainly seems to be case that more access to porn is associated with less rape. Rather than making people want to go out and rape, it satisfies the urge.

From what little I know about the psychology of rape (disclaimer: I'm no psychologist), I'm lead to believe that the implied causation here is total bullshit. There should really be no causal relationship between porn availability and rape. Porn is about satisfying sexual urges. Rape is typically ***not*** about satisfying sexual urges, it's about exerting dominance.

They're extrapolating from two cases... I'd have to see their methodology to confirm for sure, but this passage right here sounds like bullshit.

Causal relationships should not be established unless there's a very solid theoretical relationship between the variables. No, I'm not talking about some theory you come up with sitting at your desk for a couple minutes, I'm talking about real theories backed up by real research. For more on this, you can read some papers by statistician David Freedman, for example ""[On Specifying Graphical Models for Causation, and the Identiﬁcation Problem](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/601.pdf).""

Huh?  The original Red Faction's tech was revolutionary and it made for an amazing game that people probably spent countless hours on just doing crazy things with explosives.  I probably spent dozens of hours even on the glass house tech demo.

Red Faction 2 was severely consolized and just an unforgivable sin - they almost totally removed and limited the tech that made the original so interesting and stuffed it full of mediocre shooterisms.  That was one of the biggest sequel disappointments I've ever had.

Red Faction: Guerrilla was a /terrible/ PC port and was basically unplayable for months.  I gave up on waiting for them to fix it (how could they leave it that broken for so long?).

But this is just a definition. Singer's definition is another.

I also belived that HAARP was for weatherwars and I was quite happy with myself for having figured it out, but then I got more and more data that indicated that this is not the case, its just a disinfo-story to hide the more sinister use of it for mind control. 

There was a story from the 90s that have been scrubbed from the net about a Australian collage graduate that manged to program his friends via a alphabet translated into 1 and 0s that could be transmitted via small electric shocks via the skin. When you had learned the language via hypnosis (ie. non-conscious) then he could send you stories or a text describing actions that you would do, and your brain would interfered them as your own actions generated by your own brain. His disappearance and the scrubbing suggests that he have been swallowed by some black project or is now working in some Deep underground base/facility..

Some sources for you if you want to see for yourself.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This was a house party in college. Early in the night I was talking with a couple of my buddies when the fat chick that lives on their hall came over. Thinking nothing of it, they let her in the conversation because, well, the party isn't much of anything yet.
Then all of a sudden, I'm drunk of my ass and this girl has decided to cling to me. Fearful of being forever alone, and being drunk, I figure ""Well, shit. I guess this is going to happen. Better just go along with it and hate myself later.""
So, there we were, I was leaning against the kitchen counter, she was pressed up right against me. She's fat, there's no way out. Thankfully I'm still staving her off my face.
This guy walks through the kitchen en route to the living room - where the keg is. He sees me, what's happening to me, and calls out, ""Hey man! Want a beer? Let's go get a beer.""
I thanked him and went to the keg, where I met a girl (short, skinny, and cute) who I then dated for 4+ years.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Would it hurt to provide a little context?  What do you consider 'delicious'?  What sort of budget are you working on?  Are we talking malt liquor, grain alcohol and boxed wine in your garage or are we talking about going out to a bar and trying to keep your tab under $40?

If we're talking about pure cost, [these guys](http://getdrunknotfat.com/?ob=5) have done some of the work.  You'll notice that the list is dominated by generic vodka, box wine &amp; cheap beer/malt-liquor.  If you're concerned with taste, you can automatically add a bit to the cost of getting drunk off the vodka to include a mixer.  With that in mind, strong beer &amp; box wine become more practical.  I suggest keeping them cold &amp; just getting used to the flavor - just find the ones that aren't terrible (hint : Olde English 800 is passable, if you get into much stronger beverages, taste suffers.  Similarly, Franzia is generally better than Carlo Rossi).

"canada","t5_2qh68","I'm well aware of the division of powers under sections 91 and 92 of the BNA Act and how they delineate the powers and responsibilities of the provinces as well as some federal powers in addition to the reserve clause.

I'm also well aware of the various senates that existed at the provincial level (in the case of PEI, until very recently, actually).  I don't see though how either of these facts have anything to do with your assertion that ""it's the federal legislature and the provinces have no business meddling in its affairs.""  This is a constitutional matter and the provinces are the key players in the matter according to the amending formulae.  Who better to speak up on this issue?

&gt;If you're advocating for the abolishment of the Senate I would contend that you wish to see the office of the Prime Minister become even more powerful.

I am not necessarily for or against abolishing the Senate.  If the Senate could be reformed in a way that was elected by some manner of PR and didn't give PEI (pop. 141,551) the same number of seats as Ontario (pop. 13,210,667), then I could get on board given the *caveat* that it would also depend on how aboriginal representation (post-Charlottetown) and double/triple majority situations would work.  However I think the odds of that happening are exceedingly unlikely so I generally think abolishing the Senate (which would only require approval under the 7/50 rule rather than the unanimity rule) is the preferable avenue even though it may not necessarily be the best avenue.

However, I don't agree with your contention that supporting abolishing the Senate means wishing to see the office of the prime minister become more powerful.  In fact, given that a majority of New Democrats support both abolishing the Senate and reducing the power of the prime minister, I don't see how you can possibly make this assertion with a straight face.  The senate affords the prime minister one of the strongest tools in his arsenal for maintaining power and rewarding dutiful loyalty—that is, namely, patronage.  Take a look at the PRI in Mexico and how they were able to maintain a popular support base base for most of the 20th Century using very similar techniques in addition to clientalism.  Once the PRI's power of patronage and other clientalistic favours started to wane, their grip on power collapsed.  I see no reason to accept your contention that a similar situation is impossible here in Canada especially since the Senate has rejected, I believe, a grand total of 4 bills since the 1990s and thus, by definition, does not serve as any meaningful check on the prime minister's power anyway.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When learning a new retail inventory control system, I was readjusting the points at which our inventory would come into the store.  e.g. I am basically telling the computer ""I want a new case to come in from our warehouse when there are 6 left.""

I was resetting an entire section of product, and by mishitting some of the keys on the gun, I didn't properly exit the screen on which I was to set the 'reorder point'.  When I scanned the UPC for the next item, THAT is what was saved as the reorder point (the first 5 digits of the UPC code).

So, the computer tried to order to bring our inventory level above that newly saved reorder point.  On our next delivery, we received 4 skids of strawberry-banana yogurt cups (about 40,000 units of them), and about 40 skids of store-brand frozen dinners. 

I admitted to the fuck up as early as possible, proposed a solution (gave up using the computer system until after receiving 'proper training'..which never happened and I eventually started using it again), and helped arrange the return of something like $100,000 worth of product that we didn't need.","1306890388"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","May 2009:  I was photographing nude models in a state park.  They warned me about ticks in the area, so I thought I was properly prepared.  The models walked away without any ticks.  Me?  I get home, and I discover 3 ticks on me... all in different spots in my body.  My husband and I tried to remove the ticks properly, but two kept their heads.  I thought I was going to be fine, buy my husband was paranoid and kept the ticks just in case.  About three or four days later, I'm sick and it's just getting worse and spots were showing up all over my skin (I thought they were my normal allergy hives).  I'm convinced it's the flu, and my husband is worried it's not... all the while repeating, ""I'm not kidding, you could have [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever)!"".  So we go to the doctor, give him the ticks, tell him my symptoms, and he runs the tests.  Doc says, ""Well, it's probably not, but we're going to put you on antibiotics anyways.""  A day later, he calls back to make sure I'm definitely taking my medication and that my fever didn't spike or the spots start to burst because apparently one of the ticks infected me with RMSF and the other had Lyme Disease.  He kept repeating that I definitely needed to finish the whole regiment or else it could come back and I was still at risk to dying.  I was off my feet for 4-5 days post doctor appointment, and it took about a month to recover from the muscle loss/fatigue.  I still have some of the spots under my skin from the blood vessels that didn't quite burst.  They look like freckles.  My husband isn't too keen with me pointing and say, ""Look honey!  I've got spots!"" lol

June 2010: I was shooting a full-day wedding event in a barn out in the country.  I come home, tired as well, and a spot on my arm is itching like crazy.  I scratch it for a few days, and finally my husband convinced me to go to the hospital.  We figured it was a spider bite, but that was fairly common for me during wedding season.  The skin was starting to blister and that wasn't normal.  So, I get to the doctor and he looks at me and basically goes, ""Yup.  That's a brown recluse bite all right.  Luckily, it's not too bad but take this antibiotic until it's done and don't scratch.  If you break the skin, you'll rupture it and end up with a hole in your body.""  He also told me to stop finding weird bugs everywhere.  :)

Shooting weddings in NC ended up with a few more bites than normal -- accidentally rolling over fire ant hill, multiple spider bites, getting trampled by people going for the bouquet.  Fun times. :)","1306890419"

Marijuana itself, I don't have any issue with.  Legalize it, whatever.  If they legalize it, the crime issue would dissipate (or find another market).  But I have an issue with the process of buying illegal drugs because people think they are morally right and causing other people grief.

The badge concept should be limited to only those who are serious about quitting. Issuing mass amounts of badges to everyone and anyone is impractical, because knowing stoners, they often forget about the decision they made to themselves and relapse into habitual behaviors. This is a system of self-accountability. If someone cannot hold to it, they should not ask for a badge and/or they should ask for their badge to be removed if they have relapsed. Your ""vision of what helps people really get better"" is irrelevant because everyone is different; different methods help different people.

If anything, if the badge system helps one person and only one person; it is worth it.

"compsci","t5_2qhmr","Some feedback on your code:

(casting is using the int() function there, or any of the other type functions which you will learn about.)

Much of the casting is superfluous in this code. In Python, you do not need to explicitly tell Python what the type of a variable or value is, it will automatically know. The means that the only time you need to cast a variable, is when it is of a type which you don't want. One such case is input from raw_input. The input you get back from that is going to be a string, so if you want an integer you need to use int() to turn the sting into an integer. Otherwise, if you give the variable what looks like an int, it's an int, for example:
    b = a - 1
    b = int(b)
The cast to int is not required, as the value you are setting b to is already an int. same with c = a c = int(c)
Now, with a = int(a), this can be useful to make sure that the value you receive from the user is an integer, but in general you can assume that the arguments will be of the required type.

Your use of the variable ""c"" is not required, as it's value is just the same as ""a"", which you never change. In other words, you can just use a where you use ""c"".

As others have said, it is best to avoid using global variables if you can. To avoid globals, you should research the ""return"" keyword.

You can also use ""elseif"", as I see you have noticed.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","That number doesn't make any sense, because CO2 doesn't simply decay away. Life on earth might play some kind of sequestration role if we allow forests to grow really big, but in general, once burned the carbon is in the atmosphere/the oceans for good. At least radioactive material stops being radioactive after awhile, and the most dangerous stuff almost by definition stops being radioactive pretty quickly.

The ""faults"" of nuclear power could perhaps be divided into two sections: 1) Possible accidents - nobody sees these as potential. 2) Waste - there is potential here because the vast majority of the energy locked up in the fuel is still there after the first time through the reactor.

The faults of solar and wind are fundamental differences between how we consume power and how it is generated/when it is there to generate from. By contrast, nuclear is a very good match.

I don't advocate casting wind and solar aside. I also don't advocate calling them a solution to the energy question right now for the same reason I don't advocate for fusion technology to be implemented right now; they're simply not ready for prime time, and the only reason we're seeing more of them right now is government is interested in paying lip service to environmentalism in order to win votes. In 5-20 years, it might be a very different story.

I'm a scientist, and maybe you are too. I think that telling the general public that now is the time for wind and solar when the numbers counterindicate that conclusion ultimately discredits all we work for. Without a strong trust in science and the scientific by the general public, we are *doomed* in the long game not only due to global warming, but whatever else comes next.","1306890451"

"wow","t5_2qio8","Both disc and holy are perfectly viable for raid healing and random heroics.

Disc, especially with a mastery heavy build, is superb for predictable AoE damage.  You can roll PoH on your raid parties to stack up strong DA bubbles before the burst hits, mitigating a lot of damage.  After a certain gear level (and more so for 25 man), PW:S spam also becomes a viable (if boring) method of raid healing.  Disc also has the two best mitigation cooldowns in the game in Power Word: Barrier and Pain Suppression, along with great burst healing in Penance.  

Holy also has it strengths, with Lightwell and CoH on top of PoH spam for raid heals.  Holy mastery is incredibly strong in a raid setting - to give you an example, the HoT is often 10% or more of my total healing, and is basically free healing. Guardian spirit is an incredibly useful tank cooldown and has saved many a wipe.

In the end, it comes down to what you enjoy the most.  Both specs are perfectly viable for either role (although each has a different strength).  The priest toolbox is shared between both specs, and the few spec specific spells won't break you one way or another.","1306890460"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt; What if I decide that I want to eat humans? Is your response simply ""Humans get rights, uh... because?""

Because we'll hunt you down and execute you. That good enough?

H. sapiens has human rights because the every member of the species gets it.

&gt; You are lambasting other arguments for not being rational

No, I'm lambasting them for trying to apply rationality where it does not belong. When we try to apply what looks like rationality to this problem, we discover that we end up with not just absurd results... those might be tolerable. We instead end up with abominable results. We find that suddenly we can dispose of people because they didn't quite make the cut at an IQ test and we have tyrants weeding out inferiors like they were culling livestock, and suddenly what language you speak or religion you practice decides whether or not you're a slave or a real human.

So let's not go there.

you are saying tiger woods has a right to say this, not only because tiger woods is american, but also because tiger woods is better than the other golfer, and this gives him the right to say anything he wants to?

going on from this, i imagine you would be horrified if some semi-pro sc2 player insulted idra for his play, because idra is better than him? what about if some top korean gave idra shit and told him to kill him self. i can imagine all you idra fanboys totally being calm and collected in that situation.

oh wait, no i don't. you would take /r/starcraft down with your fucking shitstorm.

After that, its basically juggling your dots and casting Mind blast as soon as you get shadow orbs to keep empowered shadow on yourself. You want to reapply them right before they run out. You cannot clip them anymore so its actually better refreshing it 1 second before it expires. Reapply Dots if you get a beneficial buff such as lust or Power Torrent as the DoT do damage based on the stats you had while casting them.

You should always have refreshed your dots before casting Dark Archangel since it removes your Dark Evangelism stacks and it takes 2 mind flay to get them back.

Use your shadowfiend on CD as an extra dps cooldown.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","It's undoubtedly a combination of mixing and mastering, but the key is to create really good mixes. I believe the best thing a producer can do is learn everything they can about putting together a detailed mix and keep the mastering tools to a bare minimum. Less dynamic processing, more frequency control. If you have multiple compression stages on both individual and master track, your not really hearing the mix. 

Have you read any books on the subject? If not, maybe try [Mixing Audio: Concepts, Practices and Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Audio-Concepts-Practices-Tools/dp/0240520688/ref=pd_sim_b_3) to start with. Something as simple as carving out frequency ranges for every single part and enforcing a ""no crossover"" rule can enhance the clarity of a mix tenfold.

Now, that being said, if your parts don't have detail on their own, then there is a bigger issue. This could be anything from poor sound design to poor playback conditions, but if you listen to other mixes on the same system and they sound great then it's probably the former. Do you layer your sounds? How much care to you take crafting the attack of the sounds you use? Most of a sound's character happens in the first few hundred milliseconds, so the attack is crucial in the definition of percussive, bass, or lead sound. Pads usually need lots of creative layering to make them stand out, assuming that's even what you want from a pad.

Another thing that many people aren't aware of: be careful with EQ. If you're not using a linear phase EQ, it's pretty easy to destroy a sound with the color introduced by phase shifting. Even then, too much Lin-Ph EQ can suck all the life out of a sound. Sometimes you have to give up on a sound if you find yourself applying an excessive amount of EQ just to tame offending frequencies. Either that or write around the sound more than you otherwise would.

Okay, that's my thoughts on possible fixes. Hope it helps you and good luck!

No, but nor does defacing the PBS website. It's a childish act that cannot and will not in any way whatsoever do anything to make Manning's situation better. PBS had nothing to do with Manning's current predicament, nor can they do anything to change it. Defacing their website is childish, not moral or ""standing up for what is right."" Although I would be very curious to read your explanation of how this was in fact a moral and right action to take.

&gt;The fact is I couldn't care less about effective propaganda and the opinions of the stupid masses.

Of couse not. You after all ""understand public perception very well"" except for the fact that it's a tool that can make or break you. All the moralizing in the world doesn't mean jack shit if you don't get masses of people motivated and to your side. You don't have to respect the masses, but you DO have to use them... if you want things to work out for your side. 

&gt;the mere fact that they actually stood up and did something in the face of evil is the only thing that matters.

No, the mere fact that you and they are so fucking stupid that you think that defacing a news-site will make a difference is what happened. And you're right, it is the only thing that matters since it makes the pro Manning side look like insane, immature assholes... a position we normally reserve for the right-wingers in this country but it's certainly not their domain alone. Any jackass can earn the right to look like insane, immature assholes. Hacking news organizations and thinking that they (not the government) are ""the face of evil"" is a great start down that road.

And you know what? Fuck it, I'm not even going to bother reading or responding to the rest of your shit.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Both issues to me are ones in which one has to make a decision without knowing absolutely the truth of the matter.

My personal take on it is to look at every situation uniquely, and not prescribe some pre-made formula to it, and always try to do what is the most fair, the most just, and the most good.

For example, if my family was starving, or so poor that I couldn't eat vegan, I would probably kill an animal for food.  I would do my best to avoid such a situation in the first place, though, and then do my best to do it in the least cruel way possible.  

With abortion, I feel the same.  Don't get pregnant if you don't want a baby.  Don't put yourself in the situation where you are likely to get pregnant if you don't want a baby.  Don't kill the baby just because you made a mistake - live with the decisions that you chose to make.  

On the other-hand if you were raped, or have to make a ""mother dies or baby dies"" decision, or similar, then an abortion might be the most moral decision depending on the unique set of circumstances.  Such a decision would be heart-wrenching for me, and I do not know with certainty which direction is the most right, so I refuse to judge someone else on whatever direction they chose.  Also, I don't see why an abortion pre-sentience would be any worse than a period, and I doubt (but do not know if) sentience occurs very early in fetal development, so maybe that's OK regardless.  

I guess that makes me mostly ""pro choice"", but with fairly strong limits.","1306890532"

Every one of these characters dies as a result of reciprocal violence. Rocket on the other hand, who had as much reason as Ned to take revenge on little Ze, lives because he transcends the cycle of violence.

It's simple: live by the sword, die by the sword. Violence begets violence, and it's always tragic even when it's justified. 

So there's the self preservation argument for avoiding violence, the escalation of which will catch up to you eventually. More fundamentally, though violence isn't really good or justified in its own right. No moral person feels good after killing someone, no matter how deserving. It's not even a good feeling fight somebody and win. The people who are drawn to vengeance are usually inexperienced fighters, immature, or psychopaths. 

So yeah, defending yourself with violence is a choice. Most of the time it's not a very good one and usually not necessary. There are other ways to diffuse situations nonviolently. In City of God, Rocket is a master of this art. We can learn from him.","1306890532"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","TL;DR  I shit myself at Arlington National Cemetary

When I was 13 my I went to private school, and the set field trip for that year was to Washington D.C. 
One morning our group of 30 or so kids got up early to go to Arlington, VA to visit the [cemetery](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/) there.  I forgot to take my morning dump.
Anyways, we get there and right around the tomb of the unknown soldiers I start getting this urge.  It slowly builds and builds as our tour guide talks and talks.  I couldn't take it anymore and asked the teacher where the nearest bathroom was.  His answer: at least a half a mile walk.

Here I am running to the nearest toilet over a half mile away clenching my butt cheeks like it's no ones business.  All the while the pressure is still building.  Finally I am in sight of the bathroom: a converted outhouse, and I can barely contain myself.  50 yards away I feel a dribble.  10 yards away I can feel physical shit coming out of my butt.  In the bathroom I can start to smell it.  Finally I sit down on a toilet, my butt cheeks already wet, and I lay waste to the porcelain throne.  Mind you there are about 5 people who see me running into the bathroom and hear and smell the awesome shit that takes place.

After I was done cleaning myself up everyone was outside waiting for me.  Rumors spread.  Eventually I just gave up and told someone what had actually happened.  Needless to say I was known as the guy who shit his pants at Arlington to my 30 or so classmates for the rest of the year.  ","1306890548"

As long as you can pay off the minimum each month you're fine. Though the interest and finance charges are retroactive if you are late, so pay the minimum as soon as you get it and put more in as time goes on. 

One time I set my payment for a day after the due date (no clue why I did that) and didn't notice it on my statement till the next month when they called me wondering if anything has happened to me recently to not pay the minimum that month.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The tournaments I went to for GoW were much more reserved. These guys all knew each other extremely well and just were great friends. The psyching at those tournaments were limited to ribbing and inside jokes.

The CoD psyching was extreme though. Players would actually have ""posses"" of people harassing other competitors, to the point there were people throwing up in the bathrooms. This was ultimately a contributing factor to me quitting competitive gaming, as after the fun was taken out there was no point to play a ""game"". 

As for the NBA finals, I am absolutely praying that it's Dallas. Call me old fashioned, but I believe what the Heat did last summer violates the sanctity of competition and doesn't encourage a good competitive environment for everyone involved. This is happening all over the league (I do acknowledge that a lot of the burden for this should fall upon the Celts) with the rumors of Dwight moving to the Lakers and CP3 getting out of New Orleans at the next oppurtunity. You also have the Knicks who are going to turn a lot of heads next season.

So yes, I hope for anyone but Miami to win, as I believe what they have done ruins basketball in the competitive sense, but adds a lot to the marketing value. 

As a last note my favourite team is OKC, so it really goes to show you just how badly I dislike Miami. ","1306890553"

If I loan $100 out at 10% to 10 people.  And those ten people take out ten of these loans to loan out $100 to ten other people at 11%.  And those loan recipients ... blah blah blah who cares?  Loaning people money doesn't produce a tangible or beneficial product.  It facilitates the purchase of capital and the hiring of labor, but only if the loan actually goes towards purchase of capital and hiring of labor.  If we're just shuffling paper around in a big Ponzi scheme.

&gt; Credit is a useful, glorious service that allows all of us to be richer, and it's just as important as manufacturing, because without credit, there would be vastly less manufacturing.

But the only reason that credit is valuable is because it ultimately goes towards purchase of manufactured goods.  If you're just buying credit cards with your credit cards, you're treading water.

I don't mean to say that credit - and the people that provide the credit service - are totally useless.  But the value of their service is balanced on the assumption that your paper (or electronic) money is valuable.  And the thing that makes your money valuable is the material goods and services you can trade for it.  If you can't get a good or a service for your currency, credit cards are completely superfluous.  If your economy doesn't produce goods or services, you're living on borrowed time, waiting for someone to decide that the credit you are using to buy their tangible goods isn't good anymore.","1306890560"

Last year a close friend of mine who I lived with, we'll call him Jeff (because his name is Jeff) had an old friend visiting from California, his name is Nick. All three of us went to this party at a friend of a friends 'warehouse loft space' normally these sorts of things make me want to spew, but we wanted to show nick a good time, and Jeff and I wanted to makeout with cute crust punk girls.

So we went and ended up drinking too much, and figured we wouldn't be able to safely drive home. Luckily the girl that Nick was talking to all night was a pretty relaxed seeming straightedge pixie dream girl archetype, so we give her our keys and let her drive us home, she was such a bad driver that she would run over the sidewalk at every turn, and somehow kept accidently hitting the car in neutral, by the time we got home we were all so pumped up on adrenalin from thinking that we were going to die that we decided to all stay up a bit longer.

Thats when this girl let her crazy side out, she told us all about how she just got out of jail for helping her ex boyfriend sell heroin, how she set someones porch on fire for ""weeks of psychological abuse"" which turned out to be just completely ignoring her. When she went to the bathroom we all were trying to figure out a polite way to get her to leave, but she quickly came back after finding an acoustic guitar. 

She started singing elliott smith and butchering chords, Nick was horrified and Jeff noticed it and decided to roll with it like a true troll, he started making requests on behalf of Nick ""ohh do you know any Moldy Peaches?!? Nick absolutely loves them!"" Nick did not love them... Jeff then started making up all these crazy stories about Nick beating up nazi punks, starting a community garden in a poor part of town and being the opening band for a bunch of bands only this girl would care about. She believed every word of it and asked Nick a bunch of detailed questions, which jeff would usually answer and blame Nicks sheepishness on him just being modest

Later we put her to bed in a roommates bed whos out of town for a few days, and do a few more shots so we'll wake up drunk instead of hungover and all go to bed. A few hours later I'm woken up by the girl trying to climb into MY bed even though I easily said the least to her throughout the nick, I kick her out in the nicest way possible saying I just got out of a really serious relationship and I'm not ready to put myself out there yet. She says she understands and climbs out of my bed. 30 minutes later I hear the sounds of aggressive fucking, her high pitched noises sounded like a bike horn and it all lasted for only about 10 minutes This made me shudder but I wasn't going to get in anybodies way, we I figured we were all adult enough to risk whatever sort of STIs she might be carrying.

The next morning I wake to her sitting across from me, on my bed, singing me songs, I pretend I'm asleep but she just doesn't stop, for easily half an hour she is singing me every terrible song she knows, while my body is in a confused limbo between drunk and hungover. when she leaves I grab my phone to warn the others, I see that Jeff has left me a voicemail saying that he had some work he needed to do so hes left for the day, and another from nick saying ""im so sorry I did this to you"".

Turns out she tried to sleep with all of us the night before, but only jeff was into it, she left after sleeping with him to try and sleep with me, then nick, then back to jeff, and jeff ended up leaving his own house at 6:00 AM on a saturday to get away. 

She stayed at our house for almost a week and turned all of our food into terrible stews that tasted like cat butt and sweat.

TL;DR: Don't stick your dick in crazy no matter how cute, or else you'll have to sneak out of your own house.","1306890566"

On the other hand, any trading dealing with commodities is usually considered speculation because of the sheer volatility in those markets. Gold is an exception, because you can invest the money and reasonably expect a return. However, oil and the like, usually considered speculating.","1306890570"

Yeah, you could kill someone with the hammer, but the crime there would be the murder, not your intention to use it as something other than to hit nails with. This might not matter to people who use a hammer for the creator's intended purpose (or stepping out of our analogy, to people who use a PS3 to play games and watch movies), but the idea that they would try to enforce its 'proper' use without any legitimate ground should cause alarm for both camps.","1306890603"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Started when I was 36, conceived a month before my birthday, and had my son when I was 37. It took about 5 months to conceive, but we weren't really trying. We figured it would happen when it happened.

As for it being harder to conceive after 30 or 35, it really does depend on the lady. And man, for that matter. Someone can trot out statistics, but they don't mean much for the specific individuals involved.

One thing to note is for ladies 35+, your OB might label you as a high-risk pregnancy because of ""advanced maternal age."" Don't let this frighten you. For me, it really just meant, I got offered more tests to check for genetic issues and had more sonograms. I'm fairly laid back, so we did some of the tests, but not others.We didn't do the amnio et al, just the bloodwork.

If you want to get a basic idea of your chances in conceiving, make an appt with your OB to discuss your options. They can check your hormone levels, review your medical history to check for any potential problems, give you tips on tracking ovulation, and some even offer a transvaginal ultrasound to check out your internal lady bits to make sure anything is okay.","1306890647"
"techsupport","t5_2qioo","Looks like a dead hard drive is your issue. The flashing question mark folder indicates the computer is having troubles locating/reading the OS drive. If you have your original installer DVDs, put those in the disk drive, hold the C key as the computer boots to boot off the DVD, and run Disk Utility. Chose your main hard drive, select Repair Disk (not Repair Disk Permissions) from the First Aid column, and see if that helps.

A word of warning, if your hard drive is dying, you might want to not do anything at all to it until you verify you have a good backup of the info on that drive. If the drive is almost dead, which it sounds like, there is a small possibility a software like DiskWarrior can help you recover those, even if the drive doesn't boot an OS.","1306890647"

Look at Microsoft. They sold more now than ever before, Windows 7 did great, Sharepoint is taking off, etc... and their stock price is static. This is the chart for Activision (Blizzard) on the market: http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/dynamic_charting.aspx?selected=ATVI&amp;symbol=ATVI

Change it to 5 years, and see how it looks to you. The price hasn't gone that high, despite them acquiring Blizzard.

One, a gun safe in the house in plain view doesn't pose the immediate danger that a gun on the floor board within easy reach does. Now if the officer knocks on your door and there is a gun on table within 2 feet of you, the reaction of the officer might be different.  
Second, depending on the state the house and car are viewed in different manners. 
Third, if the guy had all the legal right to own the gun then confiscation should not or would not occur depending on the state. I know many states have the law that the weapon cannot be within easy reach and must be secured in either the trunk or a locked case while driving as well as unloaded.

These are all aspects that have to be taken into consideration. Once the gun was secured  if the person came up clean, the officer should have unloaded the gun and returned  and then  asked the individual to secure it in the trunk. I know if I was a police officer and I have a routine traffic stop and see a gun in easy reach, I would ask the people in the car to get out and secure the weapon to keep my own life safe wouldn't you.

If the class is taught well by the professor, the students work hard, and the test covers material that has been covered in the class period by the teaching of the professor and the studying of the student, then the curve should begin from 100% and go down.  

You seem to instead put all the blame on the test, taking none of the responsibility for getting a failing grade, and claim that you are smarter than me.

But, I should realize that I'm talking with someone who still thinks that ""English Major"" means ""coffee maker"".  Even with 40% of English majors go on to medical and law school (English actually being the preferred degree for law students).

But, go on, contribute to society with your degree in pharmaceutical genocidery.  Pat yourself on the back for saving the wealthiest 20% of America from having to deal with the problems associated with the common cold at a prescription price of $12 a pill.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Check the local pawn shops for bolt action .22. Bolt action will force you to line up each shot more carefully so you aren't just throwing an entire mag's worth of ammo down range in ten seconds (plus bolt action is more fun). Pawn shops mean cheap. Also, learning on iron sights will be more rewarding in the end.

You should be able to find a decent gun for around 100 dollars. Check the bolt to make sure it slides well (it'll be sticky because it probably hasn't been oiled for a while, but make sure nothing is obstructing it). If it has a magazine, make sure the magazine slides in and out easily. Check the bore as much as you can to make sure it's not obviously damaged.

My philosophy is don't spend a lot on your first gun. 100 dollars for a gun, 20-40 dollars for cleaning supplies, 20 dollars for a 525 round box of Federal bulk .22LR means about 150 for your first range trip. Spend a couple hours shooting to get comfortable with it. Then go to Dick's or Scheels and buy a 10/22 or a nice Marlin.

This is assuming you're still learning and haven't shot a few thousand rounds yet. If you have, then by all means, knock yourself out. Dick's and Scheels are good. Check for a Dunham around you too.","1306890745"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Okay. sigh. I'm gonna address this. first of all, I was braless in one of the pictures because I had to change quickly and didn't feel like putting on a bra. I wasn't trying show off my breast at all; I hadn't even really noticed it, and it wouldn't be a big deal if guys didn't have, like, nipple radar. second of all, I'm not showing off my cleavage, I'm just wearing tank tops. I like to wear tank tops, and I happen to have breasts. I really don't think the fact that I have breasts and nipples should mean that I can't wear what I want to. third of all, showing off my feet? that just makes me laugh.I'm usually barefoot 'cause that's how I like to be, and having my bare foot up on the table was a part of the clone's overall personality, not a chance to show off. 

as for the ""doing so in the total recognition of the fact that you'd get almost no attention were you a guy"" statement, you have obviously misconstrued me. I just meant that if I were a guy who took pretty much the exact same picture, NO ONE would accuse me of attention whoring. that's just not fair. It's like, if you're a girl that men happen to find attractive (which I realize is pretty much EVERY girl between the ages of 16 and 40--I don't think I'm special or crazy attractive, and it doesn't mean much for internet guys to be giving me compliments because I know they give them to plain/ugly girls as well) then the second you post a picture that includes you--no matter how hard you try to make it about something else--you get accused of attention whoring. it sucks, really. if you hate the way guys react to stuff like this, then take it up with them, not me. I'm just trying to be a human being that isn't completely and utterly judged on my gender. 

anyway, I took this picture years ago, when I was first learning to do clone pics in Photoshop. the idea of this one (and all the clone pictures) was to create different personalities through just visual cues, and I feel that I accomplished that. I honestly don't think any of them are even great pictures of me; for instance, I hate the way I look as the wine clone and am not a big fan of the beer clone look either--but I do think I accomplished what I meant to do, which is make a clone picture that looks real, exhibits different personalities, and is humorous. And I'm proud of it for that reason, and that's why I posted it. the fact that many men will drool over anything in a tank top is not my fault, nor should I be blamed for it. 

I've also posted plenty of other pictures that I happen to think are fun and funny--of my pet rats, my pet hedgehog, my cat, an emu that was terrifying--for the same reason. because I like sharing my pictures and talking to people about them.

so I appreciate your concern, or your fake concern in order to make your trolling seem more real--either way, but I don't feel bad about what I posted.

I kind of struggle with this notion, because for example in Milgram's experiment all participants were put in the same circumstances and yet some people just refused to deliver the shock.

Another issue I struggle with is that we have to take everything based on faith,everything... because nobody really knows what the fuck is going on here. It could be a ghetto, or it could not be a ghetto, there could be *they* or not, how do we know? We have to make a sense of this cruel world so we seek the explanation and we usually find one that satisfies us (like your explanation, I can totally believe in that) but it does not mean that it has anything to do with what is going on in reality.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I got away but by talking my way out of it instead of running.

This was rush hour, and as I cross the street on a green light, I nearly get run over by a bitch in a minivan. I had to jump out of the way or I would have been hit.

So I kick the side of the minivan in anger, in full view of a cop car. Then I cross the street, right in front of the cop car (waiting for the light), like a boss.

One of the pigs then yells at me:

— Hey you! What’s that with kicking cars?

— … I say nothing and stop by the cruiser, looking annoyed like when you miss your bus and have to wait 5 minutes for the next one.

— Show me some ID! (this was before I learned about [section 73 of the penal code](http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/rsq-c-c-25.1/latest/rsq-c-c-25.1.html#sec73), and a good 20 years before I watched “[Don’t talk to police](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc)”) he then barked. So I hand the pig a visit card (personal business card — back then, I lived in a “bad” area of town, but having visit cards is rather high-class, so that made the cop be unsure about me — especially that I was in a business suit).

— You know that’s vandalism? he then started to lecture me.

— You saw that she nearly ran me over while I had the right of way! I finally said.

The cop then dicked about with my visit card (I guess he ran it through the computer and got back nothing), handed it back to me and told me to leave, which was funny because the next thing I would have done was to say “okay, let me sit in the back [of the cruiser], and let’s go after that bitch who nearly killed me”.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Buying pot is not cheap at all.  The very fact that it is illegal means it is not cheap.  Drug dealers mark up for their risk and because they have no real competitors.  This is the reason why drug dealers are so against full legalization everywhere you look.  They would not be able to compete with a free market.

One tobacco plant yields about 3-4 ounces of tobacco and one pack of cigarettes (at let's say $10 for premium cigarettes) has approx. 0.65 oz of tobacco in it.  That's approx $15.40 per ounce of tobacco.  On the street, premium marijuana will run you anywhere from $40-$80 for 1/8th of an ounce (3.5 grams).  Marijuana yields anywhere from 3 oz to 1/2 lb per plant, depending on how you grow (outside, inside, hydro, etc.).  It is also much easier to grow since there is so little processing put into it.

Even with regulation and taxation the price would drop dramatically.  The only reason dispensaries can charge as much as they do now is because: they have no real competitors.  If people could grow their own--and trust me, they would--the price would level out at a fraction of what it is now.","1306890773"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Because you posted a lot of similar monitors, I'm gonna narrow it down step by step by eliminating the monitors that you posted that I wouldn't buy first, and I'll say why.

[ViewSonic](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824116421&amp;cm_re=ips_monitor-_-24-116-421-_-Product) I do not like this monitor's price.  It is too expensive for a 23"" 1080p monitor.  Also that ridiculously tall stand just looks goofy.

[NEC](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824002578&amp;cm_re=ips_monitor-_-24-002-578-_-Product) this monitor is also too expensive for what it is, and the response time (14ms) makes it pretty bad for gaming.  You may see trails or slight ghosting.

Those two monitors I would not buy.  The rest are all acceptable, but there are better values than others.  You must also factor in what is important to you.  

This [Asus](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236103&amp;nm_mc=EMC-IGNEFL053111&amp;cm_mmc=EMC-IGNEFL053111-_-EMC-053111-T-_-LCDMonitors-_-24236103-L07B) is really nice, but a little pricey for what you get.  But other than the price, no complaints.

[This Asus](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236123) is the same as the last one, but smaller.  Better value, in my opinion, but this one is priced to compete with this next monitor...

[Hanns-G](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824254052) This monitor looks like a steal of a deal.  The biggest drawback I can see is the low contrast ratio (800:1) but it is supposed to make that up with the dynamic contrast ratio.  This monitor is exactly the size you want, the ratio you want, (1920x1200 16:10) super bright. (400cd/m2)  Sometimes on monitors that are super bright like this, with low contrast ratios, you might get light leaks at the bottom and top of the screen.  This may have been resolved with LED backlights and dynamic contrast ratio.  These issues are the tradeoffs you get with a cheap monitor.

These last two are pretty similar.  They are both closer to the budget end of the spectrum, but they'll do fine for your purposes.  The difference is do you wanna pay an extra [$60 (50% more!)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236052) for an additional 2 inches of [screen space.](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236052)  With the money for the Asus, you are halfway to another monitor, which seems nicer to me.  If your games can't use a dual (or triple!) monitor feature, this may be lost on you.

So, I'd say that the 27"" Hanns-G is probably the best for you with a single monitor set up.  I'd argue that a 27"" monitor needs to start having a higher resolution though, maybe 2560x1600, for it to be a nice 27"" monitor.  At that price, I'd rather just get a smaller TV and use it for gaming at 720p, in addition to the small Hanns-G monitor (or if you can afford it the smaller Asus.)

If you can use dual monitors, it is pretty awesome to look at all the time.  Anytime you need to switch between windows, dual monitors really shine.  Writing a report?  One screen has your work, the other screen your research.  Or whatever combination.  It really helps you more than you realize before you try it.

Finally, I think it would be wisest for you to do what you think is best.  If you really want a massive monitor, go for it, because dual screens won't be able to replicate that.  Every time you use your computer, you'll use the monitor, so make sure you are happy with it.  If you decide on a large monitor, make sure you check out prices for TVs in that range, because you'll often save money (lots of competition between TV manufacturers.) ","1306890786"

For example, if you bred a new variety of tomato and patented it, you could then sue Monsanto if they grew it without your permission. (http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/plant/)

Monsanto cannot patent everything. They can only patent ideas which haven't been done before (i.e. putting a certain bacteria gene into a cotton plant). That's why they can't patent 'breathing air' and sue everyone on the planet. The patents have to follow rules, have a look at the link to see what those rules are.

Also an organic farmer (in principle) can sue a GM-farmer for tainting his field and causing him a loss in profit. Google gives several cases of potential lawsuits happening, but there does not yet seem to be a clear court decision.

I like trying out different titles to see what people like, didn't mean to upset anyone. 

My blog is (and will always be) an ad-free space. I started it at the beginning of the year to challenge myself as a writer, and to document the strains I come across. Beyond this, I wanted to give people a dignified/free space to read about Cannabis. Prior I had kept a lot of personal documentation to keep track of which varietals were helpful to me medicinally. On a hobby/passion level, to record aromas, smells, and effects. It was an easy transition to just blogging all of these in a more structured fashion. Point being, I have no reason to generate hits. I don't care if anyone reads my posts, I wrote all this shit down for my own personal gain before. 

I try to do as much research and cross reference as possible when writing up varietals, but it isn't always easy to garner correct information. 

At the end of the day, its a niche audience that wants to read self-indulgent pseudo prose about weed...Reddit has become a good place to find other people that are interested in my writing. 

I appreciate the information, the other thread has made me curious to the 'true story'. If you're interested in PMing me accurate details, I think I may compile all of the stories I have heard for a 'Story of Green Crack' sort of post.

I am currently getting treatment for it, after getting diagnosed with vaginismus/high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction. In the mean time, I enjoy a fantastic sex life with my husband - just leaving out intercourse. We love using hands, mouths, toys and other body parts with each other.","1306890816"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Short answer: Classic misdirection.

Last week the cat was let out of the bag on the Ryan Plan: Voters realized that the Republicans are trying to dismantle Medicare.

That's a major hit for the Republican Party, polling data shows that as much as 80% of people in this country found it unacceptable.

So the Republican leadership drums up this great idea: spin this debt ceiling thing into Democrats ""business as usual, wasteful washington spending"". 

If you listen close enough, you'll notice the Republicans do not cite specific programs. That is because the ""reckless"" spending they are accusing Obama of is mostly relief aid for the majority of the voters.

The new spending must occur, or else we default on our loans, our credit will tank, and China will invade us. (haha, joke. but seriously, they wouldn't be very happy if we default while they have untold fortunes invested in us)

However the Republicans can make a big stink out of it (because most people don't care enough to understand what's going on) and wash the Ryan Plan from public memory.

It's a desperate ploy. People are starting to realize just exactly what the Republican spending under Bush has done to this country.

The chickens are coming home to roost.","1306890820"

The district you're in is old, even though you're experienced you're still on the bottom of the totem poll. You get cut so they can pay for a fresh teacher who makes 25k less than you a year.

LOL. In my side of America we could only wish that could happen. Here, once you keep teaching for a decade or so, you can never be cut, no matter how bad you are. It's great for colleges, not so for little schools.

So what happens if a teacher sucks? The district moves them around through all of their schools in hopes that they don't affect their children as much. In New York, if teachers are really bad, they are dumped in a room, each school day for 7 hours, and paid full wages to do... nothing.

Whist allows for scientific play I suppose, but on the whole it is rather uninteresting and relies too much on conventions and constrained communication. If you fancy that sort of game, I should think you would prefer Bridge to Whist, but I digress. Piquet requires but two players, and will hold your interest long after you learn it. It does not require an eidetic memory to play well, and the game has more variety than Bridge or Whist. Piquet is also of considerable antiquity, at least four or five hundred years old. Indeed, the game is one of the few remaining games that survived the invention of the trump suit (even though that was ultimately borrowed from Tarot games).

"beer","t5_2qhg1","I'd be willing to accept ""I don't like the affects alcohol has on my body"" or ""I'm allergic to gluten"". These apply to a common thread that would be transitive across that set.

The issue arises with the blanket statement I don't like (broad food/drink category). Which, at least left on its own, implies that they are specifically referring to the taste. If it refers to some other aspect of that item people have a strong tendency to qualify what they don't like (eg. ""I don't like the texture of x""). I suspect the reason for this is it's often difficult to explain what you don't like about a specific flavor/taste so it just goes unsaid. My contention being that there is no common thread in ""beer"" when limiting it to taste alone.

What I'm looking for is not an admission that they're a beer lover, merely that the blanket statement ""I don't like beer"" is more than likely not true since there probably exists exceptions to it.

You can add this as a run script build phase in Xcode (I'm just guessing Unity builds Xcode projects you later compile, based on a random visit to their site a year or so ago), but it might better to look towards finding the cause rather than just duct-taping it, which would be the equivalent of my suggestion.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It's not ""We the People"", It's the Business who runs this country now, and when it comes to getting cheap cheap labor, the business and all the rich are addicted to slave labor. 
They can't have enough. 

Weather its the ReThugolCons or the DumORats, its all about flooding the US with the dirt poor from all over the world for cheap cheap slave labor. It has nothing what so ever to do with being white or black.

Americans are being replaced with scabs from all over the world in every state and industry. 
The British scabs are getting all the media, movie and TV slots. 
Are you not sick and tired of the very crude British accent 24/7 on American TV? Oh YES We are.

The Philippines are getting all the nursing jobs while all the American nurses are being laid-off and replaced. The Indians are the largest influx; they are bent on total takeover by any means including any and all kinds of Fraud. The Indian have been used to replace more American in every industry then all the other countries combined with H-1B/L1 visas. The Indians also have the largest influx with Visa over-stayers and Anchor Babies. Just between 2003 to 2008 over 75 million Indian entered the US and never left.

The Irish also have a very large influx of Visa over-stayers and illegals mostly in the north-east. And yes we all know about the millions of illegals the from south 
and north of our borders.
 
With over 30 years of open border and free pass to all business to do whatever they want, we are in the midst of becoming a third world just like all the cheap cheap labor we have allowed in.

Just like in real life, sorry there is no happy ending and again I am very sorry to say, but the worst is yet to come.  So who really cares? NO ONE!

"Military","t5_2qh8y","&gt; As a matter of fact, I think everyone starts with a reserve commission and then has to apply for a regular commission. Don't let anyone kids you, you're going to be on active duty for several years.

Although this was true when I joined in 2005, they changed the law soon after. All officer accession sources for active duty officers (OCS, NROTC, USNA) give you regular Navy commissions.

With that said, I definitely agree with talking to an officer recruiter, and even more specifically I believe the USNR has their own officer recruiters.

My understanding of the Reserve environment at this point is that you can be prevented from mobilizing to active duty for up to 2 years after you join, but after that it's possible to be called to active duty for IAs/GSAs, and by ""possible"" they mean you should expect to have it happen at least once during your time in the Reserves.","1306890848"

There wasn't a photo posted to @RepWeiner. Instead, an internet stalker sent a fake screenshot to the recipient. [Evidence here](http://errorlevelanalysis.com/permalink/428f7a2/). The area around **RepWeiner** is clearly a cutout, otherwise it would look similar to ""Upload"" or ""Popular"", which are both very clear and without that ""spray"" of distortion (actually image degradation that happens between two images) you see over ""RepWeiner"".

"gaming","t5_2qh03","As has been pointed out several times, the problem with pay-for services are two-fold:

* If the extra charge you pay isn't worth it, nobody will subscribe and it will be come one of the many things people will mock you for online
* If it is worth it and it adds some level of advantage to online play, it unbalances the game for those without the paid services, essentially discriminating against them unless they upgrade or gtfo.

It is just a move to milk the franchise, which given the current trend in the gaming industry is hardly a surprise. 

What is the greatest thing about this, though, is that it is purely self-inflicted. If people hadn't gone out in droves to buy DLC, pay for insanely priced ""Special/Collectors"" editions and paid for addon services (like the AH/Guild Chat on your phone for WoW) then these kind of blatant milk-the-consumer moves would probably require a lot more consideration on the part of the companies pushing them out.","1306890854"
