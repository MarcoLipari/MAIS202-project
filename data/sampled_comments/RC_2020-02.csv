so if you accept that you've just said that gender identity is a thing that exists and that someone can be a woman without being ""assigned female at birth"".... But they'll say it just means ""not trans"" and there's no reason gender critical people shouldn't like it... right?",1580515201

What about all the female people who due to fertility and ability to ovulate are confirmed to 100% female and would fall on the female extreme of the distribution even in your bimodal distribution model of reproductive sex? Your answer here seems to justify all these women being discriminated against and seen as naturally nurturing and wanting to get pregnant just for having the biological capacity to get pregnant as your counterargument to why a female person shouldn't be portrayed as wanting to get pregnant seems to rely on her not being fully female your model/not having the capacity to get pregnant.

"answers","t5_2qkeh","There is no precedent or constitutional framework for altering the results of an impeachment. That's not necessarily going to stop anyone who wants to from attempting to litigate that, and it's not necessarily going to stop the Supreme Court from deciding to hear the case and issue a ruling. Odds are that it won't happen in any meaningful way and even if someone does it's probably possible to keep it tied up in court until well past the end of what would be Trump's second term. 

Realistically the Supreme Court is incredibly unlikely to risk their credibility on what is constitutionally at best uncharted waters, especially when the public reaction would probably be constitutional amendments dramatically limiting their power.

It should also be noted that there is neither precedent nor law nor anything in the Constitution requiring that the Senate do anything with witnesses. They're not even required to give the House enough time to make their case and be comfortable, the way it's written they could have said, ""You have 10 minutes, go!"" 

Also it should be noted that at this point the Democrats are all but imploding. The obvious coming acquittal is going to galvanise Trump's campaign making him damn near a sure thing to get reelected, barring a major recession between now and Nov. The last thing that already weak appearing Democrats are going to want to do is appear to have lost the impeachment and be trying to appeal that to the Supreme Court.",1580515209

"ukfinance","t5_2szsm","A valuation is simply an indication to the buyer as to whether they are getting value from your purchase. They can then decide if they want to change their offer and/or walk away from the purchase.

The seller has no obligation to consider a revised offer. Please note, however, that as soon as a revised offer is made that the original offer is now void - and the seller has every valid reason to reject the revised offer, too.

What is a valuation, anyway? Somebody's ""professional"" guess as to what the property is worth? Phooey. A property is worth whatever somebody is willing to pay. That's the only true valuation that exists. There's a reason why you have mortgagee auctions - and that's because the only way a bank knows how much a property truly was worth is to let people bid on it.

Property, however, is special from a legal point of view. Unlike almost every other kind of sale - a property sale can only be conducted via a written contract. Until you sign on the dotted line *everything* is mere talk and not legally enforceable. So let your buyers try and bully you into accepting less. Are you prepared to walk away? If so, tell them no, and hey, you can tell them the property is now ¬£500 more expensive if you want.

The fact is these cheeky buyers would not be offering a smidgen less if they didn't want the property, they'd have walked away or offered an outrageously low amount. They're just trying it on, and it is more likely you could successfully bully them into paying more - after all they've already shelled out for solicitors.",1580515210

      * Jacket, down: Marmot model no longer available. Easily get me down to freezing. Packs small.
      * [Jacket, fleece, Arctyrx Delta LT](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/delta-lt-jacket): Jacket style for everyday wear. I like this a lot, very functional, looks good.
   * Bag, compression, full
      * T-shirt, blend v-neck: Some cotton/poly blend from Gap or somewhere with a picture on the front. Everyday wear.
      * [T-shirt, Uniqlo](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-packaged-dry-crew-neck-short-sleeve-t-shirt-418695.html?dwvar_418695_color=COL09&amp;cgid=men-t-shirts#start=15&amp;cgid=men-t-shirts): These are $5 cotton blend tees. The look good, hold their colors over time, are hard wearing, and dry really quick.
      * [Underwear, Weldon, Silver](https://mackweldon.com/products/silver-boxer-brief): Trying a mix of undies in the Kenya wet season to see how well each style dries. This is the 'heaviest' of the bunch, and the most comfy to wear. I suspect they will dry slow. We shall see.
      * [Underwear, Weldon, Mesh](https://mackweldon.com/products/airknitx-trunk?variant=30873543278705): Also comfy, similar to the Airism. Should dry faster, theoretically odor-resistant. We shall see.
      * [Underwear, Airism](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-airism-low-rise-boxer-briefs-405000.html?dwvar_405000_color=COL07&amp;cgid=men-underwear#start=69&amp;cgid=men-underwear): I don't really like these. Basically a plastic bag over your junk. But the dry quick and are light and pack small. Hoping the Weldons can replace these.
      * [Socks, Darn Tough](https://darntough.com/products/mens-ss18-vertex-no-show-tab-ultra-light-cushion?variant=854095560723): No cushion for quick dry, short, but long enough to wear comfortably.
   * Ziplock, sandwhich
      * Cable, USB A to USB C, long
      * Earphones
      * AC Adapter, universal
      * USB charger, 2-port
      * Power bank, battery, 3350 mAh
   * Ziplock, sandwhich
      * Clothes line
      * Tissues, Puffs 10-Pack
      * Meds, full
   * Toiletries bag, Eagle Creek
      * Nail scissors
      * Toothbrush: Cut down handle just for easier packing.
      * Razor: Generic safety razor. Never had an issue getting this on the plane.
      * Shower scrubber: I cut down a regular one to make it less dense and smaller to pack. May use a scrubby-glove next time.
   * Ziplock, sandwhich
      * Shampoo / shower gel: Body Works high concentrate stuff.  A pea size is all you need, so 3oz lasts forever.
      * Sunscreen, Factor 30, 1fl
      * Toothpaste
* Self (does not count towards total)
   * Wallet: Home made minimalist wallet made from ripstop nylon.
   * Underwear, Wirarpa
   * Socks, merino, long
   * T-shirt, Uniqlo
   * Pants, jeans: Because I wear them everyday, and they just work.
   * [Shirt, linen, blue](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=427535092#pdp-page-content): Dries quick, can be layered over a t-shirt and worn open, or buttoned up, or work under the Covert sweater.
   * Phone, Pixel 2
   * [Belt, black](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/nexus-belt/): Probably won't use this one, but something similar.
   * [Jacket, fleece, Arctyrx Covert](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/covert-1-2-zip-neck): Great thin fleece sweater. A little technical looking, but easily passes in everyday wear.
   * [Shoes, Sacony Jazz](https://www.saucony.com/en/jazz-low-pro-vegan/11839M.html): First time using these, but they are light, look like they will dry quick, and have a great sole-grip pattern for day hikes.

It has antibacterial/fungal benefits, reduces stress, mimics their natural environment. You can also do this with Rooibos tea, make sure it is organic and noncaffeinated (the only ingredient should be Rooibos tea) to be safe for your betta (you can float one bag in the tank for a few hours and let it mix with the water and release tannins, or steep it in a separate jar like the IALs).",1580515210

Franxx was a simuldub, so I saw episode 1 and 3 or 4 days later, I was in to record the show. I watched the show because I heard it had EVA parallels, and I enjoyed the world building a lot! I wish we had a few more episodes over all so we could have seen a bit more pay off for that build.

**- I saw in another question that you read manga. What series have you read in the past?**

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",1580515212

"redscarepod","t5_hq6n1","An Interesting story from a friend who is a nutritionist. 

The dairy industry had tons of whey as a byproduct from making other dairy products. They discover that bodybuilders have problems ingesting easily broken down proteins and start marketing whey protein to gym people. Even though a really fit person can only make use of 10-15 grams of protein after a workout when it‚Äôs absorbed quickly they start recommending scoops of 30-40grams, just for sales sake. Then they realize people are gaining weight and the bounce people are getting from the proteins isn‚Äôt that noticeable. 

So they start to add testosterone to whey powder because the industry is unregulated and there isn‚Äôt FDA testing for ingredients. That becomes widely known in exercise physiology circles and then endurance athletes start using tainted supplements as a defence when they are caught doping with testosterone. However it‚Äôs widely known they usually use a patch for slow and steady absorption and to bypass the gut. Once taken to doping trials they enter used up empty cans of protein powder as exhibits to prove they were not taking stereos. There are residues of testosterone in left over dust that regularly show up in test labs that try to find which brands of whey are contaminated. 

. However, some experts say that the busted athletes were likely taking huge amounts of Test in patch form form like what an old man takes. When they got busted they got clever and started adding testosterone to already empty cans of whey to manufacture an alibi.  They take these cans to labs and get results showing contamination and try to build an alibi. There are long lists of batches and manufacturers to avoid for these athletes so everyone knows which brands to buy in the first place. 

Anyways. Food is fucked when you scratch the surface.",1580515212

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","I have mixed feelings on this. On some levels, I feel like it's a bit predatory to force people to shell out so much money for charging cables. Recently, the charging cable for my laptop broke, and my mother, who had almost an identical laptop to mine, couldn't share her charging cable with me because it was just slightly bigger.

On the other hand, forcing every charging cable to be the same could potentially limit innovation a lot depending on the exact articles and terms of this bill. For example, we have some electronic devices now that can be charged wirelessly, and there are plenty of legitimate innovations being made to charging cables that aren't just slightly changing the shape to be an asshole.

There's also the issue of which charging cable are they going to go with? Is one company going to make all these charging cables, or are companies going to get the schematic to make them themselves? Is someone going to get a royalty from all the charging cables sold? It has the potential to make technology a lot more expensive depending on if the owner of this charging cable design institutes the concept of forced scarcity/exclusivity.

I guess, ultimately, I would need to see the terms and conditions of the law before I'd agree or disagree with it. I'd be all for punishing companies like Apple for only slightly changing their chargers for the sake of making more money rather than the chargers genuinely being much faster. As I said though, I think this law could very easily be abused depending on how it's written. I hope that isn't the case, though.",1580515214

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had a trio of friends in college, and we kept in touch fairly well after we all moved away. One girl, Emily, went back to her home""town"" (read: top ten biggest city in US) and it became clear after a few years that we were growing in different directions as people. 

But we were still close when I got engaged, and as I opted for an elopement, there would be no need for bridesmaids. I did, however, want a bachelorette party --- a cabin in the mountains and a trip down whitewater. LOW KEY. 

At every fucking turn, Emily was difficult. Dates didn't work. Cabin was ""too much"" ($130, but she spent over $1k on another bach party in Miami?! And expected HER party to be in fucking VEGAS?!) and finally, I handed it over to my friend to handle. She got the troops together, picked a date, and everyone agreed. 

On my birthday, six months previous, Emily bailed, but said nothing to me directly (I left the planning group for my own sanity). Wished me happy bday, even! Claimed she had a work trip to attend, suddenly, with 6 months notice, and I just kind of wrote it off as another notch against her as a friend. 

I got back from my bach party to find I was hidden from her Facebook...but she hadn't hidden my friend, who was able to confirm that Emily had actually gone to the beach that weekend with her newest set of friends. I deleted her from my entire life that day, along with the two other members of the trio (who couldn't be bothered to speak to me about any of it), and not one of them, Emily included, ever reached out again. 

I don't miss them, but sometimes I still get mad when I think about what a bitch she was (is).",1580515215

"Windows10","t5_2u9xs","&gt; It's unclear What sort of ""significant development"" could be done to an OS that isn't more or less forced. 

There's no end of things that could be significantly improved in Windows 10. But you know what, it works more or less and Microsoft isn't interested in pouring more resources into Windows than absolutely necessary in order to keep the platform functioning. 

That's the whole point of the article that was linked, there's no growth that Microsoft sees in Windows, but in the cloud they can grow exponentially. 

&gt;Creating a new App Platform with UWP is more or less the result of thinking they needed to do something significant and it seems to not have gotten us anywhere.

Perhaps, but that was when Microsoft was actually interested in the future of Windows. You casually gloss over that while UWP has been deprecated (as good as) it's not because Microsoft saw the light and the error of its ways - no, it's because UWP is a project to extend the Windows platform and that's not on Microsoft's radar any more.

&gt;To bastardize a Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry quote, ""Good software is created, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.""

Great - your wish will be fulfilled. Windows will not be developed any more, like it used to. It will run the apps and games it runs today and will be maintained into the future.

We tried everything to get them in her. She was just starting baby foods and everything just drizzles out. So we never knew how much she was actually getting. She was still a baby so no way to get her to swallow it without choking her and risking aspiration. I finally gave up when I tried breastfeeding her and slipping it in while she was sucking. The meds killed her appetite so no more breastfeeding so no more meds. Eventually the loss of appetite resulted in weight loss and she got herself a gtube. Holly cow so much easier to give meds to a kid that way. Now my just turned 6 yo is having to take adhd meds and I'm having issues with him. He's finally taking them reliably if i crush it up and he can suck down the syringe. We are switching to a longer lasting delayed release med now that he's 6 so no more crushing. I don't even know how I'm going to get him in a routine for this one. It's traumatic to hold him down and force it into him, but I can't get him to eat anything with it and he just yells crush it crush it over and over refusing to swallow it. Ugggh good luck momma.

Blaming your little sisters for your parent's shitty behavior is bad enough, but refusing to acknowledge your own part in it is even worse. OP could have said no and there would have been nothing the parents could do. OP opened herself/himself up to criticism as soon as they posted this egotistical trash.

I didn't say OP shouldn't be admitted to a law school, only that I very highly doubt they were because apparently OP has a pretty shitty work ethic. I worked and did school in ""high school"" (I was homeschooled), and I was not the only student who did so, far from it.  I work over 50 hour weeks and do school now and I have a 4.0. OP'S work ethic is trash, it makes it very apparent that they are a spoiled brat. Op's not going to survive law school if they even were admitted unless they grow the fuck up and quickly. 

OP ruined their sister's chance of getting into a good school because they hated her college admissions essay. They used their network to deny them admission, which is unethical to say the least. They believe themselves entitled to decide the future of their sibling based on their own petty dislike of their sibling's viewpoint. That is egotistical, entitled, and disgusting.

I‚Äôve had more than a few long-term relationships and a marriage. They‚Äôve included men with no kids, and with kids. I don‚Äôt recall that any of them didn‚Äôt speak to their kids. With the exception of only one, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was second. The one who put his kids first had a really dysfunctional, enmeshed relationship with them - one of them in particular. They were adults, yet he was always interfering in their lives - rescuing them when they got into trouble. He was dependent on one of them to make him happy - it was almost like he secretly wanted her to be his SO. It was weird. He constantly talked about her (she was gay), and it got to be annoying and boring - like he was living his life through her. When she wanted something, he jumped to provide it.

"MAU3","t5_sflfl","I don't have a Twitter account.

Koei Tecmo and Capcom are two different companies with their own standards and own ways of doing things. They also have their own agreements with Disney/Marvel.

The games are in two different genres with differing standards and differing appeals. The same number of sales could be considered great for one and horrible for the other. DLC for one could also take less time, effort, and money to make compared to DLC for the other.

One game is, at the time of this writing, console exclusive while the other never was exclusive to any system.

What's their source on MUA3 selling worse/the same as MvCI over the same amount of time? Without a source they might as well be pulling that out of their rear end.

And lastly why do I still occasionally see people try to pit the MvC series against the MUA series?

Maybe someone genuinely thought it was their own bike, with no intent to steal. Or a thousand other reasons.

In any case, it is not upon you to decide who is a thief (_especially_ not before the fact), it is not upon you to decide what punishment is appropriate, and it is not upon you to execute that punishment. Society realized that long ago. I hope some day you will join us.",1580515220
"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","I am with you. I was born and raised here. I was raised Christian in a rural area. I went to college and my whole perception changed. Everything I was told was BS.

They have us by the balls and given us no real independence. I just hope I am overreacting.

Fine - no problem, I happened to have the stone ability for that last fight, so I figured ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just transform to block it!‚Äù

Nope. Game killed me anyway. The attack just superseded the rules of the game for no good reason other than to screw over players who were using that particular power up. K.O, Threw the game cart across the room, never bothered to find it.

The brain is different. The brain starts as a mostly blank slate and then is filled up as you go. With language, with customs, with things you do reflexively in society to fit in.  It's a lot like a computer running apps.


Your brain creates automatic responses to certain stimulation. Your alarm clock in the morning starts you along and you do your morning routine. Deviating from that routine takes effort. 


I say all this to you so you can take a step back and change perspective. If you were raised in a Buddhist temple then likely a chanting of Ohm would strike you just as strongly as singing hymns.  You would judge yourself based on those rules instead of biblical rules.

"hockeyplayers","t5_2vs1b","If you're a high D player and you're playing B and C level defenders, you're probably not going to dangle them.  Honestly, if this is a typical beer league where backchecking is minimal, just enter the zone on the side so your forehand is facing the net (so left side if you shoot right),  cut across towards the middle to create some seperation between you and the defense by slowing slightly and shoot low and hard.  Best case the defender creates a screen, the goalie is moving laterally and you score.  Worst case you create a good rebound.  Sure the defender may block your shot but most of the time they're going to just get out the way and let the goalie deal with it.  Pucks hurt.",1580515221

"service_dogs","t5_2v0po","Totally correct, you bring up some great points. The airlines are honestly (just my opinion) a total money-laundering advantage racket.

I totally agree: Seats should be able to be removed per-flight and then taken back. Heck, throw in a seat or 2 into the cargo hold, or maybe even remove the middle seat from flights entirely (since almost nobody likes the middle seat). However, the seats are made by the companies in the sets of three, and each one cannot be completely removed as its own individual unit (except in the rare cases of first and business class seats, which are their own story and actually have footspace!) Even turning seats into theater-style folding seats would be even better because they can both keep their seat and allow extra space.

Musicians could also benefit from removal of the seat next to them. I'm a cello player, and although I've never taken my baby on the road, I would certainly appreciate the extra space for it.   


There are so many other advantages. The airline industry seriously needs more government oversight, feedback from actual passengers and to become less of a hassle.",1580515222

&gt;*Fake Moody curses students in class - ‚ÄúThe rest of the class was very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Sprout lets Neville take a beating from a flesh eating plant*  
&gt;  
&gt;Honestly, these don't sound bad at all. I definitely wouldn't care if I was a student. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;A teacher venting is a lot different from being picked on. If I was a student, I woudn't care.

Yet:

&gt; I expect ear-pulling was much more common back then, but in any case, I'd perfer it to having cockroach jars thrown at me when the glass could explode and cut me up.

So venting is fine as long as it comes from a drunk teacher who is angry at being exposed for a fraud, but venting is no longer fine when it comes, in private, from someone whose privacy has just been grossly violated and whose life has been endangered.

In any case, it's not really an argument. For example, I've had teachers like Snape, worse teachers, and better teachers, and some of the Snape-like ones have been my favourites. Doesn't mean Snape's behaviour is suddenly wonderful.

&gt; I still think being cruel on purpose is much worse than on accident, as far as I can tell, the only one really guilty of this was fake Moody and Snape. 

How do you define ""cruel on purpose""? Snape isn't out to get Neville, for example, he just has little tolerance for poor students, and tries to get him to pay attention by scaring him. A harsh method, but not necessarily less effective than what other teachers use. Neville has bad results in almost every class, except Herbology, where there is little magic involved. And in the end, he obtains the same grades for Potions and Transfiguration.

On the other hand, McGonagall's punishment, in PoA, is insanely cruel, and a pedagogical failure. Sure, her main purpose wasn't to traumatise Neville, but she knowingly and willingly employed extremely cruel and traumatic measures. So she accepted the possibility of traumatising Neville.

In reality, a teacher who tells a student they're terrible will not be sanctioned. A teacher who asks children to take care of leopards will be sent to prison, regardless of whether his intent was malicious or not.",1580515224

Not only this, but I will take it to only the most utterly logical conclusion, that if you did not die from my shank, you will most likely not die from the superlaser shot, and thus I will use my immense ties with the force to bring the Death Star down upon you, not only crushing you, but also blowing you up. If you for some reason have not died due to your forcefield, then I will use my anti-forcefield on you! No anti-anti forcefields, as those are far beyond your reach, and if you do say you use one then it will be faulty as it is nowhere NEAR obtainable for a simple, smooth-brained individual like you.",1580515226

Residential neighbourhoods are not war zones, or at least shouldn't be. Preventing the firing of stray bullets is necessarily a higher priority for the protection of the community. If a police officer reasonably believes a suspect might fire a weapon, lethal force has to be an option. 

Whether it's the first option or necessary at all will depend on the circumstances, but expecting them to wait until the guy actually starts shooting with no regard for where the shots go is stupid. 

Based on the facts being reported the officer's decision seems reasonable. It's regrettable that in reality there was no threat and a man died, but this isn't a scenario where the officer overreacted to an innocent situation. The suspect created a situation by his deliberate actions where a reasonable person could fear for his life. He got shot as a result.",1580515226

Pregnant women were targeted for murder, as their stomachs were often bayoneted, sometimes after rape.

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East estimated that 20,000 women, including some children and the elderly, were raped during the occupation. A large number of rapes were done systematically by the Japanese soldiers as they went from door to door, searching for girls, with many women being captured and gang raped. The women were often killed immediately after being raped, often through explicit mutilation or by penetrating vaginas with bayonets, long sticks of bamboo, or other objects. Young children were not exempt from these atrocities and were cut open to allow Japanese soldiers to rape them.",1580515228

Hiring and training a salesperson on your own is an even steeper learning curve than learning how to sell IMO. It looks like you have the marketing part down. I'd give it a go on my own. I'm an Engineer turned marketer myself and did the sales thing on my own for two years before starting my sales team. It definitely is a learning curve and unless you hire a pro, it can be a case of the blind leading the blind.

Bringing in a partner is definitely an option, lots of marketing agencies I've seen have a fullfilment/ops guy and a sales guy teamed up. It can definitely work. That takes time though. Finding a business partner is like looking for someone to marry. Don't rush in. Check out your network first and see if there are any takers. Go to networking events/conferences and look for people you gel with. It's. Process. Ideally  you partner up and split everything down the middle. Typically businesses like this have relatively little startup costs, so asking for capital upfront might not make too much sense. The real commitment is time. And finding a quality person that ALSO has the time/desire/interest to jump into biz with you even part-time can be a challenge. Given your comments in this thread about wanting a salesperson as a stop-gap solution I think you need an employee, not a partner (partner would be ideal though).

As for what kind of employee you can get, just depends on your local market. In the Seattle area I could get newbie sales reps for $15/hr base and the rest in commission pretty easily. Seasoned sales pros? Base needed to be closer to 6 figures plus bonuses. Very competitive market due to all the software companies. I'd recommend as low a base as you can And put commission on top. Target earnings let's say is $60K pero year, 30K base 30k commission (your local numbers may vary). Real sales people want the upside Commission can bring. Right now my sales team is 80% commission for their target earnings. They love it. They're pros.

What's your market like? Put up an ad on Craigslist/ZipRecruiter/Indeed and give it a go. I personally wouldn't want someone 100% commission because I think the quality of the persona goes down or may need to give up too quickly since your sales cycle may be 2-3 months and they need to eat today. The best sales people I've found have some sort of base.

"shiba","t5_2s5ny","From my experience with my shiba, positive reinforcement and time-outs (1 min or less in the bathroom) are what works best to get my boy to listen. However I can‚Äôt say I NEVER yell at him. For example sometimes when he is being mischievous, and we can tell he is up to something like getting ready to grab one of our shoes, we yell out his name in a stern tone and that‚Äôs usually enough to get his attention and then we redirect him with a toy and play with him for a while because going after our shoes just means he‚Äôs bored. My Shiba also hates being restrained so less is more when it comes to restraint and I make sure to let my vet and the vet techs know because they understand some dogs are like this. For example if I tried to grind his nails while someone else just holds him somewhat snug, he will lash out and try to bite because he gets scared. So I learned quickly that the only way he will let us trim his nails is if we give him a spoonful of peanut butter to keep him busy and happy while I work in his nails and he is perfectly content with that. Most shiba owners agree that positive reinforcement and consistency is key to training Shibas and usually the people that say ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not dominant they‚Äôll be a terror‚Äù are people that have never actually owned a shiba so don‚Äôt take what they say too seriously.",1580515230

My girlfriend never worked out in the gym before. She doesn‚Äôt eat a lot so she‚Äôs skinny. Because I work out so much, she wants to give it a try too. Our school has free gym so I went in with her to show her the ropes. We warmed up on the treadmill. I saw her boobs bouncing up and down and since she‚Äôs so pretty and the treadmill faced the main gym area, it seemed like some people were staring at her, particularly this Asian guy. I have never seen a guy make his stares that obvious, so I have never told a guy off for staring before. She wore a sports bra, but a very flimsy tank top, so the bouncing was obvious plus she has fake ones that are kind of distracting even without the bouncing. I told her that her boobs might be distracting other gym goers. She looked down and said she‚Äôs going to switch to the elliptical. 


After that we hit the weights and I told her that this Asian guy a few benches over was staring at her chest while she was running and when she was doing dumbbell chest press. She asked me if I was sure. I said I was. She said to not make a big deal out of it because it‚Äôs not his fault. On her third set, I saw the Asian guy staring our way again and I had to tell him off. I told him to stop leering at my girlfriend and work out those twig arms of his. He said he was sorry and walked out. My girlfriend said I was too rude and she wanted to leave now because everyone is looking our way and she‚Äôs feeling too self-conscious to work out any further. I apologized and told her I should have whispered that to him rather than letting people around us hear. She said I‚Äôm a dickhead for insulting that guy‚Äôs arms like that. I said he was disrespecting her and needs the wake up call to respect women. She still seems mad at me for making a scene.

They seem to have changed it.

https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bed3fa08028fc2f95eea31085984cc5e.webp

Palestine has become independent?  The illegal occupation is over?  Good.

&gt;The core question that Jewish respondents were asked was: Should Jewish patients be allowed to choose to be in a [hospital inpatient] room only with Jews? Thirty percent said they fully or mostly agreed with this statement.

&gt;The Arab respondents were asked the same question, in Arabic rather than in Hebrew, and with the words ‚ÄúArab‚Äù and ‚ÄúArabs‚Äù replacing ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù and ‚ÄúJews.‚Äù Twenty-one percent said they fully or mostly agreed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susya#Khirbet_Susya

&gt;Over the years, a number of media outlets have published evidence showing the segregation of Arab and Jewish patients in hospital inpatient wards, particularly maternity wards. Keshet and Popper-Giveon‚Äôs study shows that this appears to be a common occurrence based on unofficial policy. And of course those numbers of 30 percent and 21 percent show that this phenomenon has grassroots backing from patients themselves.

&gt;According to a nurse in a maternity ward who was interviewed for this study, ‚Äúit comes from Jewish patients. Arab patients have never asked me to do so. Jewish patients may ask me to do them a favor and not place them beside an Arab. I don‚Äôt know .... It‚Äôs a dilemma.‚Äù

&gt;The line between racism and a legitimate patient request is not always clear. ‚ÄúIn pediatric wards we also segregate nowadays,‚Äù said a (Jewish) doctor who was part of the study.

&gt;‚ÄúThe rationale is that there is a different mentality, different smells, different manners of behavior. There are differences. Peace and quiet on the ward is something that patients want,‚Äù the ""doctor"" said.

&gt;‚ÄúSometimes things are said that are unpleasant to my ears, such as ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to be with these Arabs, they stink, they bring the whole family here to visit.‚Äô... We try to address these problems but I can‚Äôt educate people.‚Äù

&gt;One Arab doctor who was interviewed told of an incident in which a Jewish woman refused to have an Arab boy placed in her son‚Äôs room.

&gt;As one hospital director put it, ‚ÄúI believe that only a small portion of this is blatant racism, such as a statement that ‚Äòthe female terrorist from East Jerusalem has arrived with the next terrorist,‚Äô put her in that room.‚Äù

&gt;Another (Jewish) nurse said: ‚ÄúSometimes, I feel hurt on their behalf, such as when people say they don‚Äôt want to share a room with them. I tell them they‚Äôre missing out and that it‚Äôs too bad. If only they got to know one another.‚Äù

&gt;Beneath this visible tip lies an established policy of separation, anchored in the very foundations of Israel‚Äôs rule over the territories. This rule stipulates freedom of movement for Jews but restrictions for Palestinians; permits for houses only in specific communities, rather than an egalitarian permit system based on just and fair criteria; eligibility for social benefits and welfare services for one side only; dispossession of the other side from its lands; and of course, different legal systems for people who live in the same territory, including different court systems, different punishments and more.",1580515232

*****

&gt; ECATEPEC, Edomex - Familiares y mototaxistas se manifestaron afuera del penal de Chiconautla para exigir la libertad de su l√≠der Jos√© Ad√°n Mart√≠nez Rojas, quien fue detenido supuestamente por tener conflictos por el control de una ruta de mototaxistas   De acuerdo a sus familiares, el 24 de enero de 2020 fue detenido en la colonia Ol√≠mpica Jajalpa por polic√≠as de investigaci√≥n a bordo de tres unidades y remitido al Ministerio P√∫blico de San Crist√≥bal Ecatepec.   

&gt; Sus familiares se√±alaron que Ad√°n Mart√≠nez fue acusado por Brian Alejandro Hern√°ndez Cigala, por la disputa de la coordinaci√≥n de la base de mototaxis.   

&gt; Anteriormente Ad√°n Hern√°ndez hab√≠a sido amenazado y golpeado por √ìscar Verdiguel Morales, alias ""El R√°bano"", de que si no hac√≠a caso, le pasar√≠a lo mismo que a F√©lix Alonso Garc√≠a R√≠os, chofer de mototaxi quien se neg√≥ a ceder a sus exigencias y por ello de igual forma est√° recluido en Chiconautla acusado de extorsi√≥n.   

&gt; El abogado del afectado, El√≠as Garc√≠a L√≥pez asegur√≥ que el l√≠der de mototaxis fue acusado de extorsi√≥n por cobrar cuotas en la organizaci√≥n, las cuales son usadas en caso de accidentes y para eventos, por lo que asegura que demostrar√°n que no hay elementos y que su detenci√≥n fue ilegal.   

&gt; ""Los polic√≠as nunca mostraron orden de aprehensi√≥n, ni citatorio, exijo que les hagan una investigaci√≥n porque los que acusan son gente conflictiva,¬† est√°n apadrinados por polic√≠as de investigaci√≥n y funcionarios del MP"", acus√≥ Blanca Estela Garc√≠a Ontiveros, una de las familiares del dirigente.

"Atelier","t5_2ysy9","All of Arland and dusk including lulua would be on the harder side, but even Sophie, firis and lydie and Suelle is harder than ryza.


In most of the other games let's imagine I want to do something dificult like make a max quality item with 3 specific traits. I'm going to need 4 max quality ingredients with those specific traits and that's going to take a lot of work to get, some traits may only show up on strange items that aren't related to my bomb, so you'll have to work that trait through a few different items... On top of that some games have a cost for traits, so you'll need to max out TP raising traits along with the special traits that you actually want on your item.


In ryza you don't need all of your ingredients to be max quality in order to make a max quality item, and you can just make the item and come back later with the traits that you want and add them one by one without needing to plan everything in advance.


It's actually really nice because in every other game if I mess up an item (miss one trait) I'll need to start over from scratch, but in ryza you can make a good item and come back later and make it better.",1580515233

"LittleMacMains","t5_38j24","I can feel that. I just think that the Smash team wouldn‚Äôt buff Mac without removing some good things about him. JoeK made a video over Mac, and he brought up the idea of removing super armor as it doesn‚Äôt fit Mac‚Äôs playstyle since it is the opposite of what one does in punch out: In punch out, Mac can‚Äôt trade attacks. I also think it would help players properly learn how to play Mac so they actually get punished for using Smashes all day. 

A really cool idea that pays tribute to Punch Out NES is when you avoid an attack at the ending frames of Mac‚Äôs dodge invuln, you either get reduced startup lag for one move, reduced startup lag and/or end lag for many moves briefly, or put the opponent in slow motion like his counter briefly (I really love the last one). 
In Punch out NES, when you time your dodge right to avoid an attack at the end of the dodge animation, you get to punch faster.",1580515233

"infj","t5_2r39a","The benefit of Ni in this situation is its desire to find and track patterns as well as a willingness to dive deeper in order to better understand those patterns. While Ni doesn't necessarily save all of the data that it sorts through like Si does it still SEES that data. It makes judgements on whether that data is relevant to the pattern being followed. 

I kind of see Ni like a math problem. It goes through all of the steps and does all of the work. When I comes to an answer it writes it down on a separate piece of paper and is basically like ""here is my conclusion."" Most of the time Ni views the scrap piece of paper where the problem was worked out as no longer relevant and will discard it (hence the poor Si). Now, in my personal experience Ni does save the scrap papers on important conclusions. When my Ni tells me to disregard my Fe it saves its work. Since it ""knows"" I won't easily accept a conclusion that tells me to disregard Fe it keeps track of the data a bit more. Or maybe it saves the info because it ""knows"" it's important I'm not sure. Accessing that data takes practice. It's not nicely filled away. It's more like sifting through a messy desk, but hey that's where Ni comes it. You basically demand Ni sort through it's own messy desk (rediscovering past patterns) to find the scraps of papers it worked the problems out on to show you. 

A quick and real example:

Ni: don't bother trying to have a relationship with your father.

Me: why?

Ni: he doesn't care about you.

Me: why do you say that?

Ni: he never listens when you try to tell him about your life.

Me: that's not true! He asks me about my life.

Ni: *sighs heavily**starts rummaging around for notes* No, he doesn't. Remember when you tried to tell him about your new boyfriend and he zoned out until you stopped talking? Remember when you tried to tell him about a problem in your life and he blew it off? Remember x, y, z, etc?

The notes your Ni fetches for you will never be as clear or detailed as a strong Si users, but they will still be helpful. And, tbf, I have only been able to do this when it ties into Fe in some way. I can go back and track the data when Ni says ""ignore your Fe"" or when my Ni reminds me of my Fe (sort of a ""No, that's important to you. Remember?"").",1580515233

"shitguncontrollerssay","t5_31tok","I really just want to remind people... that an amendment has never been stricken.

The only example that is close ... is the passing of the 21st amendment; which still needed to be ratified (requiring 38 States) by a 3/4ths majority of states.  Even that amendment only had language repealing the previous.

So ... what you need to do ... is convince 38 states to ratify a bill that says the 2nd Amendment is no more... Even then, no gun owner (the 100+ Million) is going to abide it ... just like most brewers didn't abide the 18th.  What you'd get is likely a massive civil upheaval long before it got ratified.

I'm not sure exactly who lives in the bigger fantasy world - Fudds who think their guns will get a pass or grabbers who think they'll take the 2nd off the board.

Edit: Additionally, how the hell is Bernie going to pack SCOTUS, when only three judges are even close to retirement age (RBG, Thomas, Breyer) and he's never going to be president?  How exactly does one intend to bypass congress?  What the fuck does this person actually think Bernie is going to do?  like give anything close to a political process that isn't waving a wand...

Edit Edit: Also, is this fucking guy unaware that Sanders has one of the better records for guns on the stage?

Edit Edit Edit: Further, and to be blunt, the first 10 Amendments known as the Bill of Rights - outline rights that are given to people, not by act of government, but by virtue that they are inalienable rights of the people and no act of government can void them without also voiding the consent of the governed - thus repealing them is inherently tyranny.   You cannot use an act of government to remove a right that is specifically endowed as a pre-political right.  Any such attempt is anathema to the very core of the documents they are written on.  This has literally been the corner stone of Constitutional Law since its ratification.

Correction - To ratify a new amendment 2/3rds of Congress needs to pass it for ratification, 3/4ths of states need to ratify it.  I fucked up my numbers.",1580515234

"ffxi","t5_2qn97","First, don't pull too many mobs, pull as many as you feel comfortable without getting overwhelmed.

Second, as someone already said, Carcharian Verve will give you a massive Aquaveil that will make you withstand 10+ spell interruptions. Always reapply it when Unbridled Learning is up. Forget RDM's standard Aquaveil spell. Diamondhide isn't that good because stoneskin will wear off quickly but always keep yourself with Occultation, Barrier Tusk and Cocoon.

Third, always start your cleaving with Subduction as it gives your mobs a very powerful Gravity status, allowing you to outrun them if you need space to reapply buffs or cure yourself. Just avoid wind-resisting enemies like pugs and porxies because they resist Gravity.

Fourth, your best damaging spells are Tenebral Crush, Spectral Floe and Entomb. Tenebral is a powerhouse, the same as Floe. Floe also gives a very brief Terror status on mobs. Entomb damages and petrify enemies, if you need a breather.

Fifth, having a sleep spell like Dream Flower set for emergencies is a good idea too.

Sixth, Magic Hammer is your best friend to recover your MP. But it'll only work on non-undead enemies that have a MP pool.

Seventh, about gear. NQ Jahkri set from Ambuscade is a very good starting point. Consider getting a Rosmerta's Cape with MAB augments as soon as possible as it helps a lot and it isn't very hard to get one. You should always Dual Wield clubs when cleaving. A Homestead wand on main hand and a Eminent Wand on your offhand is ok. ALWAYS put your best magic accuracy skill weapon on your main hand.

The rest is training. Cleaving isn't hard once you get the hang of it. Good luck!",1580515234

I decided to get these pens for everyday use for this year and so far they are great. The Lamy seems more consistent than the Kaweco as the Kaweco I find to be a bit scratchy at time (although this is probably because I am constantly changing my writing style in an attempt to make my handwriting neater). I use the Kaweco with the cap posted obviously and it seems very nicely weighted and balanced but my one gripe is that the threaded section where my fingers usually are gets a bit uncomfortablt to hold. I prefer the Lamy Al-Star without the cap posted otherwise it just feels a bit too top heavy.

I picked these pens because so far I have only been using some vintage pens and these seem to have overwhelming amounts of good reviews and recommendations and I wanted to experience and use some modern pens for everyday use. I didn't buy a TWSBI Eco or 580 because I'm not a fan of their aesthetics however, after seeing a few more colour options of the Eco I think that could be my next pen when I eventually need another...",1580515235

&amp;#x200B;

The big winner is EVE Online, and more of a depression quit than rage.

I played the game in beta with friends from my Asheron's Call guild, and we kept it up when it went live. I enjoyed it, though I never had any desire to get into one of the big corps or do much PvP. Played for a year or two, then left.

I came back to the game a few years later and decided to putter around a bit, working on an old goal: kitting out an industrial ship so it could fit an entire jet can of ore in one go. I was helped in this quest by a cache of Harvester V mining drones I'd inherited from the corp which were no longer available in game and so were hugely valuable. It was a ridiculously expensive ship for what it did, but I loved the Big Sexy Beast.

Then one day I was moving to a new base. This was in the days before safespace ganking was something you really had to worry about, so I was only a little nervous about putting my top shelf mining rig and a few hundred million ISK worth of drones in my ridiculously expensive space truck and flying a half hour long route. I made sure my route didn't go through any systems &lt; 0.4 security, so I was safe using autopilot for a few minutes while I went to grab a sandwich.

I got distracted talking to my girlfriend and took a bit longer than expected, but a few minutes sitting by a gate in safe space was nothing to worry about.. so I was really confused when I sat back down and was looking at a station docking bay background. It took me a moment to realize what I was seeing, and a few minutes looking at the map and the kill notice I'd received to figure out what happened: I'd accidentally clicked a star behind the one I'd been targeting when I set my route. The route was safe enough, but the final hop was a 0.4 security system rather than the 0.6 I'd been heading for. So my Beast made the journey safe and sound all on it's own, then sat at the gate waiting for my dumb ass to get back while some pirate in a frigate patiently blasted it to pieces.

I looked at my noob ship spinning in the station hangar contemplating the time and money it would take to replace everything, logged out and uninstalled the game.",1580515236

"MilitaryHistory","t5_2rlnr","The conflict hierarchy scale predates the Vietnam conflict.  The correct use of the terminology is important because it saves us from having to redefine under every circumstance.

When Harry Summers claims that the US ""never lost a battle in Vietnam"", he is correct under the generally understood terminology of the professional military. It is not the the military or his fault that laymen do not understand the scope of their definition of the term. (It has been a long time, but I believe Summers *did define* the military definition of a battle in his book, *On Strategy.*)

The important distinction here is that you are labeling his claim as a ""myth"".  To prove your point you then proceed to invent your own definition of what constitutes a 'battle'.  That is fine.  You are entitled to your opinion.  But it is unfair to the reader, and Colonel Summers argument, to not inform them that you have lowered the bar as to what constitutes a 'battle'.

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","Wow. Much bias.

Can you point to the unnecessary killings Edelgard committed in Crimson Flower? Also Claude takes basically the same path as Dimitri, how is his notably less violent?

The war in CF didn't have 5 years of a dukedom/kingdom conflict, nor a Leicester Alliance civil war, nor does it have the Gronder Field match which is described as the bloodiest battle in the war. Edelgard is shown to be willing to spare basically everyone she fights against, she even calls for Rhea to surrender.

""What Edelgard achieved was the equivalent of a dictatorship"" how is that any different from Dimitri being the King of a United Fodlan? Byleth being the King/Queen of a United Fodlan or Archbishop of a Church-ruled Fodlan? Every ending ends with a conquered Fodlan under a dictator.

She doesn't get rid of nobility immediately but her endings confirm that she spent her life reforming the nobility. It's more progress than anyone else did.

Claude manages to deal a devastating blow against TWSITD... and yet they still are mentioned as being around in his ending with Byleth. Edelgard is stated to have wiped them all out. While I wish we could see it, I don't see why we should ignore it just because we don't see it.

You are taking that ending in the worst way possible. The ending says the Church was rehabilitated under the supervision of the Church, it never states what that entails outside of the school now accepting students regardless of background and teaching practical subjects. 

How did Edelgard 'create a new TWSITD by taking over the church'? I know you said may as well, but I don't follow your logic here.",1580515237

She had no estate. She was broke and and ""retired"" and pissed away her 401k. And essentially homeless too.  Apparently being white means your privileged, according to all these social justice folks, but I've seen firsthand how it doesn't mean a thing. Not in the States, where the only thing that means shit is having money.  But I also think we suffer many of the same problems as the rest of the world and are doing alright considering.

"Nerf","t5_2qz7g","So a DC motor is not like an AC motor. If a DC motor stalls, you've got a fraction of a second before the motor destroys itself. There's also no telling of what exactly will happen to a circuit when that happens. That's why [A] blasters should have fuses, and [B] the standard practice of choosing a battery that can actually support stall current (sans fuse) is very dangerous. The only reason it doesn't happen more often is because it's actually really hard to stall a blaster.

-
Fuses are usually placed for each component of value in a circuit. In a Stryfoid, the entire circuit is just one loop, so one fuse will suffice. In a RapidStrike variant, it's possible that you will need more than one.


-
In a DC circuit, fuses are usually two wire components, and can go pretty much anywhere (in series) in the circuit. The cheap route is to get a blade fuse, like the ones for use in cars.  The socket should have external access for easy replacement. The fuse rating will take a bit of experimentation due to the nature of flywheels. You want a fuse rated just above the one that blows during regular use. Start with a rating just above running current. If the rating is too high, the fuse won't actually do anything.

-
You can also use reusable fuses, like thermistors, but it's much more time consuming to pick a correctly-rated one, since they're not widely available and you have to solder them in.",1580515238

As a rule of thumb, when you apply something a single pulse of acceleration to an object in orbit you don't change the point in its orbit now, it'll return there after one cycle. Which means if you managed to magically push a piece of debris into an orbit with a higher apogee, it would still have an LEO perigee, and the drag during that part of the orbit would bring the perigee down (again, remember the rule of thumb, you don't change the whole orbit at once, you change the other side of the orbit when you apply forces to a part of it). The orbit might be slightly longer lived than it was before, but not by much, and because of the increased drag (due to cross sectional area to mass ratios) on smaller pieces, the debris would re-enter fairly quickly regardless.",1580515239

"ZeroWaste","t5_2wf12","... why are you talking about global redistribution of wealth? For one thing, it would never work. We can't even get a national redistribution of wealth. If we wanted to start anywhere, it'd be with a national redistribution anyway, which would at least be theoretically attainable. Evening out the entire country's wealth would be a much less drastic difference in the quality of life than evening out the wealth of 7 billion people.   
  
&gt; I'm not in favor of this, I'm just sick of everyone saying, ""people who have more wealth than me should share"" but are unwilling to give up their own wealth.  
  
Realistically, people who have hundreds of millions and *billions* of dollars will have no drop to their quality of life even if they gave away 99% of it. We're not trying to get everyone to an equal dollar count here. The goal is to improve the quality of life of people at the bottom. Taking away a car from a poor family to give money to an even poorer family defeats the purpose if the first family loses their job because they can't get to work.",1580515239
"iamatotalpieceofshit","t5_3jj03","What practical use does a high capacity semi automatic rifle have for defense? If my home is getting broken into, I‚Äôm not going for my rifle.

You can get a Pro if you want, and if you do that it's going to primarily be because of the bigger display.

If I were doing photography I'd probably find a nice, preowned 2015 MacBook Pro (last model they made prior to making the newer ones with bad keyboards)... that would be a great bang for the buck, and a nice, large 15.6 in display. Plus, you get some USB A ports and some nice connectivity options. You should be able to get one of those for right around a thousand bucks, maybe a little more depending on the configuration.

Great bargain for what you're looking to do!

And, just get one with the regular Intel graphics, NOT the dedicated GPU, because you do not need it for photography. It'll be a more reliable machine WITHOUT the dedicated GPU (as sometimes they fail), and I think you'll get a bit more battery life as well.

"VGC","t5_2qp3k","Hey thanks for asking! Yeah so Leafeon I probably bring into about 33% of games. It's very dependant on the matchup obviously, especially because mine doesn't run Dig like most. Usually I will bring it against teams with a Gastrodon or with any water prescence or even enemy grass teams because of X Scissor. Sometimes it's hard to decide to bring it but it's Defense is so good it's sometimes worth it just for that. However, with Expert Belt (which was originally just kind of a silly idea that ended working well) and it's insane Attack stat, it can secure kills as a revenge sweeper really well so I usually leave it in the back.

Usually this team leads with Duraludon + Sableye to try and put early pressure on the enemy. Sableye can usually do the Trick gimmick to stop early Dmaxers which is resource denial and also gives me breathing room. Encore is so useful, either make a pokemon Protect over and over or Trick Room again or anything else. Before Sableye dies I try to make sure it uses Sunny day if I'm not bringing Ninetales, to setup the Charizard or Leafeon typically in the back.

Another lead is Ninetales + Zard and just trying to Heat Wave the enemy out early (this works well against some TR teams). I'll usually go Sableye + Ninetales against Snorlax teams (Incinerate their berries or try to Trick Snorlax out) though that is probably the teams hardest matchup. 

Usually I dynamax duraludon Charizard or Leafeon. Charizard does a lot of work outside of dynamax due to solar power but max rockfall to break the mirror is insanely powerful, especially if you have sableye to set sun the next turn again and cancel the sand. Most people don't expect it and it helps pick up a lot of KOs against Chandelure, Togekiss, etc. Duraludon is...Duraludon. Just good all around and pretty tanky.

Grimmsnarl was originally a support but does so much work as an attacker. It's insane. Sometimes I'm dynamaxing him and just killing the enemy (Conkeldurr usually) with Max Starfall. But Thunder wave is also good because the team has no speed control outside of Chlorophyll.

EV spreads are pretty standard - Zard is Timid max sp atk and speed, grimmsnarl and leafeon are adamant max attack and HP, duraludon is timid max speed and spatk, and sableye i actually don't remember the exact EVs but it's setup to be able to survive a moonblast from a max sp atk Whimsicott I believe. I don't remember the exact spread but it's a little wonky. The Ninetales spread is Timid with 84 HP, max speed, and the rest in sp atk. Honestly I don't remember why, but I knew at the time lol.

Hopefully that gives you some insight! It's a really fun team. It could be argued that Leafeon get switched out for someone with a better movepool (Iron Tail is so inaccurate and X Scissor is pretty unexciting) but it does a lot of work due to it's high attack and defense. Ninetales maybe eventually get swapped out because it is my least used pokemon, but it is a really strong to have just for Drought in some cases, and Will O Wisp is such great utility.",1580515240

Had several classes with him and while he wasn't the top of the class he ended up with enough AP credits to graduate college in 3 years. Never ""too proud"" to ask the rest of us nerds for help when he needed it.

The only time I saw him try to ""flex"" his popularity was trying *not* to be homecoming king because he really wanted to be prom king and the school had a policy of not letting previous ""royalty"" win for a second dance. It failed because he was *too* popular for anyone to not vote for him at homecoming.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","There's Regi, Joe, Victor, Rudy, and Roy (Future Man).  Rudy passed away several years ago, but they all had their instruments they had mastered.  They used to (maybe still do) play as a band together at 3rd and Lindsley in downtown Nashville.  Obviously with the all the touring, it was uncommon to see them all performing together, but I managed to do just that.  Rudy was playing sax.  Everyone else was playing what they're famous for playing.  Great show.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually took lessons from Regi when i first moved to nashville.  He always wore that big hat, but he was bald as can be under there, but he had long, legit dreads where he wasn't balding.  First thing you do when learning from Regi is he'll give you one of those 80's hair scrunchies to put around the end of the neck of the electric guitar.  Adjusting it's position would change the amount of a note would ring without being manually muted.  After the scrunchy was on, he'd start teaching that tapping technique that both he and Victor are known for.  Guy was freaky talented and he'd progressed to a point that I don't think he was playing by the same rules as most musicians (as far as what fits/sounds good vs. bad).  A fifty minute session might only be 20-30 minutes of playing and another 20-30 minutes of talking about just whatever.  He had some real jewels.  Firstly, we never went to the moon.  If we'd landed on the moon, ""there'd be some huge Nike sign or something up there.""  He also believed in a sort of cosmic harmony where he derived meaning out of what everyone else would say is coincidence...maybe apophenia.  A good example is that he believed that Nashville being known as Music City correlates to it being in Davidson County (i.e. David's Son County).  In the bible, David's most well known son and heir was Solomon, of whom the majority of the Book of Psalms (songs) is attributed.  He further bolstered the correlation by noting that all zip codes in our area start with ""37,"" which he argued was significant in that, according to him, the 3rd and 7th are what determines the root of a chord.  I didn't really understand that last part, but trusted that he knew a helluva lot more than I did.  He recommended a book that was actually pretty cool, but not directly related to music: A Beginner's Guide to Constructing the Universe.  It was largely about geometry in nature and history and delved into basic shapes and their mathematical and natural importance.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe he also mentioned not believing in paying taxes.  I got the impression that was a family thing - especially considering the Future Man's kerfuffle with the IRS.

Or he could've been friends with an Umber who died to wildling raids while their defenses were weakened cause theyd sent troops south for the rebellion and joined in order to get revenge. 

Maybe at the most he might've been supposed to go with Lyanna as escort and didn't cause he had no interest in following his sister around but I don't think Benjen had anything more to do with Lyannas kidnapping than that.",1580515241

They do it by saving a bit, borrowing a bit, learning practical skills.

Paperwork has very few costs. Insurance is a few bucks per month ... RV insurance, liability coverage. I park it in my yard. Motor oil is like $12 per gallon.

Diesel isn't cheap, but neither are airfares for other types of vacation.  


You could borrow $20k and buy an RV, second hand in okay-ish shape, or you could use that same money to build out a Skoolie the way you want it on a platform that is almost indestructible. It's up to you.

3. There‚Äôs a ton of novelties in multiple colors.

4. It‚Äôs readily available and can ship out tomorrow.

Overall it‚Äôs really not a terrible price when everything is considered IMO, but it is undoubtedly more expensive than a set that reaches a high MOQ during a groupbuy.

"China_Flu","t5_2dar36","Downvoting because even though I am not sold on the bioweapon angle either despite some very curious key differences in the proteins of this strain which preclude a dismissal out of hand without further study, your argument is so illogical and lacking any compelling thought or evidence as to be useless either way.   


There is verified evidence that there was a BSL4 lab in Wuhan working on an artificially modified nCoV.  (supposedly working towards a /vaccinecure)   


There are tons of examples in past times of militaries making bio weapons without cures. Just because you can weaponize a pathogen does not mean you can make a cure.   


This Virus currently is projected to kill less than 4 percent. Not sure where you're getting 8%. Doesnt matter if you think its useful as a weapon. All kinds of pathogens with all levels of lethality from the Common Cold to Marberg are studied by both civilian and military labs for all kinds of reasons. Often with multiple goals simultaneously.   


As far as China manufacturing and or designing a virus, how do you think vaccines are made? Viruses are cultured, modified, dissected, regrown combined and messed with in all kinds of ways for all kinds of reasons. Its a matter of record that they were doing just that with several strains of corona virus in multiple locations, including Wuhan.   


Your level of ignorance here is very evident and although I know you mean well, NONE of your post has even a slight basic understanding of epidemiology, virology or the daily workings of bio safety labs.",1580515243

The council had set an 'illegal' budget in which projected expenditure exceeded income. They were warned by the auditor that after they'd spent their allotted annual income, they wouldn't be allowed to spend any more.

They therefore hatched a plan to issue redundancy notices the specified period before the funding deadline, so they could negotiate right up to the wire for assistance from central government, without having to worry about actually breaking the law, in the expectation that central government would blink first, provide some funds, and the council could cancel the redundancy notice.
 
This basically worked - the council was granted loans to cover the deficit. Unfortunately for Militant, people didn't like their jobs being used as a negotiating tool, and the press rather gleefully spun the prospective redundancies as Liverpool's just deserts for voting Militant.",1580515245

"geopolitics","t5_2qhnn","Navigable rivers can be used to transport goods and people. Since transport on water is by far the cheapest form of transport having a good network of navigable rivers is a major advantage for a country. And before railways and roads became widespread they were even more important. 

Making rivers more navigable were some of the first major engineering works. And were essential to most major powers until the development of steam power. 

Today navigable rivers are no longer such a big deal, unless they are big enough for large barges, as small ships don't have the same advantages of scale compared to trucks.

In Europe most rivers were controlled, with locks and embankments to be made navigable but nowadays it only really makes economic sense on the big rivers. Even so in Germany river freight carries about as much freight as the railways. 

The yellow river isn't navigable because it almost runs dry in the lower reaches in the summer and has lots of dams in the upper reaches.",1580515246

With our injured crew coming back (except Rashford), we are starting to get good squad depth and looking a little less thin.

Defensively Shaw is looking good, Bailly and soon Tuanzebe are huge boosts. The rest of our senior defenders are all match fit so there should be good competition for places.

Pogba and Scott and will have a huge impact and it couldn't be more timely with the form of Matic, Juan and Fred and of course the arrival of Bruno. Hopefully all this will see a return to form for James and possibly even Lingard?

With that midfield it's should be certain that Martial Greenwood and now Ighalo (feels weird typing that) will get chances. Really hoping Martial takes full advantage. 

Keeping everyone fit is vital for this last stretch of the season, I think we have a real chance of fourth if we just. keep. them. fit.

[Nota Original](https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2020/01/31/recolectan-320-mil-llantas-abandonadas-en-calles-de-ecatepec-8150.html) | Reducido en un 36.43% | 31-01-2020 a las 15:12:03

*****

&gt; M√°s de 320 mil llantas han sido recolectadas con la campa√±a impulsada por el gobierno de Ecatepec para retirar neum√°ticos abandonados en la v√≠a p√∫blica y evitar que contaminen el medio ambiente o se conviertan en foco de infecci√≥n, al propiciar un h√°bitat para fauna nociva.   

&gt; Ricardo Gonz√°lez, t√©cnico de la Direcci√≥n de Ecolog√≠a y Medio Ambiente de Ecatepec, inform√≥ que en s√≥lo seis meses, desde su arranque, el 8 de agosto del a√±o pasado, a la fecha, fueron retiradas de las calles del municipio m√°s de 230 toneladas de llantas viejas.   

&gt; Apunt√≥ que tales recintos se localizan dentro de los deportivos Emiliano Zapata, Granjas Valle de Guadalupe y Siervo de la Naci√≥n, en los parques Bicentenario y Ecol√≥gico Eh√©catl, adem√°s del Multideportivo Las Am√©ricas, abiertos de 10: 00 a 18:00 horas, de lunes a viernes.   

&gt; Ricardo Gonz√°lez agreg√≥ que el material de estos neum√°ticos se utiliza sobre todo para la elaboraci√≥n de impermeabilizantes, por lo que pidi√≥ a la ciudadan√≠a tener conciencia de que requieren un adecuado confinamiento y no tirarlos en las calles o √°reas verdes.   

&gt; Refiri√≥ que la vida √∫til de las llantas es de tres a√±os aproximadamente y en Ecatepec existen 0.7 veh√≠culos por habitante, por lo que cada a√±o son desechados un mill√≥n 554 mil neum√°ticos, es decir cuatro mil 316 por d√≠a y la gran mayor√≠a termina en las calles.

I leased abroad for 5 years. Finding that ""home base"" was great, really allowed me to dig in to my home town and my new home country. That said, after a couple years it really sucked when we traveled - I remember in particular spending a month down in Argentina &amp; Uruguay, which was great, but financially it was a pain because we were still paying rent elsewhere. Trips like that are great, but they are money pits and you have to just be OK with going a bit broke before you come back to lick your wounds! 

I lucked into a situation now where we don't pay any rent at our abroad place. Unfortunately, it's not in the area/region where I'd prefer to live.

Your gf really does sound like she has a serious issue with food and as a first port of call should visit her gp, they can advise on if she needs to see a psychiatrist/therapist etc. Also, you don't have to be an unhealthy weight to have an eating disorder, orthorexia is a disorder where you are obsessed with the quality rather than quantity of the food, the food has to be ""pure"" and adhere to whatever strict set of rules the person has come up with. You should look into disorders some more. Because she seems to be suffering from traumatic childhood incidences and because she's willing to sort out her own food rather than expecting you to adhere to it, I will excuse her from being ruled an AH.

I didn't call you an AH cos you made your own food, it's more for your attitude, especially in your replies. I can'y help but call out the hypocrisy of you saying she doesn't like fancy food and eats food homeless people wouldn't touch but also saying you eat white person food with no spices. You don't sound like you've got the most varied and interesting diet either. Because you're being overly judgemental and hypocritical, I'm going to rule you the AH.

I would suggest going to the doc and also asking HER to pick out a recipe you can both cook together. I think the cookbook was a good idea but maybe if she goes off and picks a recipe first, it will be a gentler introduction.",1580515248

Fag propositions me for some kinky bullshit and I basically (and kindly) tell him to fuck off with that perverted shit. He takes offense  but comes back a few days later more aggressively. I had to pull a knife and put between us and warned him to never touch me. He backs off but now he's pissed. Two days later he sees me on the job and comes after me with a steel pipe and attempts to slam it down on my head. I duck, pipe smashes into my back leaving a huge bruise. It could have killed me. I grab the pipe and he demands I let it go. Nope. He refuses my commands to let it go himself. I reverse tension and he gets a light smack in the face and lets go. He comes back in to regain a grip on the pipe and I give him a more forceful strike across the face but well within the force needed to cause serious injury. I'm really not into hurting jackasses. His glasses break and he runs to call the police. The police refuse to do anything but I get a summons to court a week later. I show up and am charged with gay bashing. No attorney provided, I plead not guilty and challenge the judge for not setting a court date to plead my case and not providing me with an attorney. She enters a guilty plea for me and sentences me to eight days in jail. Most irregular court proceeding I've ever heard of. I get out and find out from the sales rep at a dealership where I worked that I now have a record of being a ""gay basher"". Today it would go down as a hate crime. I don't even hate fags, I just know they are unstable and creepy as hell.

Edit: I forgot to mention the fag actually admitted he caused the injury to my back which by the time the cops showed up was already a livid purple. He then admitted he attacked me without provocation because I made fun of him for being a faggot which was actually true. His name was Kevin. I called him Cornhole Kevin.",1580515249

Generally a very safe town - not hugely cheap as it's only an hour (if that) train ride to London and often people live in bstoke to commute to the city.

Smith is a self-acknowledged liar, in emails I received from him from a known public address, it was back-and-forth, so not spoofed.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","Actually, believe it or not, Trump is very pro gun. In February of 2019 a new bill was being passed around to make it illegal to purchase a gun commercially without first having a background check conducted on you to make sure that you aren't going to do something illegal with it, and Trump actually made statements that if the bill was passed to him he would veto it. It was only recently that he said he would try to get a stricter policy on guns following a string of mass shootings, which he still has done nothing about. 
And what do you mean by taking guns away without due process? I'm going to assume you mean the government straight up taking guns without any warrant or compensation. From felons, they are completely justified to do so both from a cautionary and legal standpoint. It hasn't and cannot happen against normal people, due to multiple amendments, namely the fifth and second. 
And even if Trump convinced the military to serve him, what are your guns going to do against a tank? A bombing plane? A nuke? Tens of thousands of highly trained, highly specialized soldiers a thousand times more experienced than just about anyone you can find on the street? Nothing. It's a pointless fantasy to think that any homegrown group could fight off the US military.

I applied for a loan last year and within 2 weeks had 8K sitting in my account with hardly any questions asked.  Paying it back 150pm over the next few years.  But got me out of a hole too.

Im unsure how much you might be able to get away with if not working / claiming benefit or help mind you.

Just assuming you are in the UK since you used the pound sign - Tesco do decent enough deals on loans. Although, without any address, I'm really unsure what else to suggest!

\-----

I watched a show a while ago and a guy was doing the the scrap lead/metal thing.  He put about 8-10 hours a day in and got about 200-250 quid for his efforts with scrap metal.  I guess it can be done.... these guys had a van and there were two of them running around picking up what they could when they pulled over at places.

\----

There are a few other things I guess we all could do to get a wad of cash quickly, but i'm not going to suggest half of them on here for legal reasons!

&amp;#x200B;

I just hope you can get creative and find a way to make something work for you, or even manage to pay up half of the amount and perhaps cut a deal to settle the rest over time.  At least some effort to pay-up with 50% or more of the amount would make the receiver perhaps re-think that they *MIGHT* just see the rest of the 10K they are after.",1580515253

The only sexism I have experienced in my current job is mainly from our clients who assume I have no idea what I am talking about and always ask ""can the boys help me out with... yada yada"". However, this doesn't mean I am going to take off my shirt and run up the street crying sexism.

I tell the customer I am more than competent to help and provide wonderful service to try and change their attitude against women in a male dominated industry.

Some opinions you can't change and they will stay sexist ass holes but I ain't going to let them ruin my day or stereotype all men as sexist for the behaviour of one.

I have never experienced special treatment for being a woman in my life.

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","I do a lot of student centered activities in my room (I flip lessons and do student centered activities daily)...since you‚Äôre new, it‚Äôs hard to find time to build good ones, so here is an easy way to start:  Task Cards

Take the questions you typically put on a review doc and put them each on a card...then build enough card sets for student groups to handle (I usually make 6-7 sets for a class).  Tell your students to grab random cards from their set and work through a review discussing answers.  You‚Äôre preparing them for an exam in that they don‚Äôt know what kind of questions will be thrown at them and you‚Äôre differentiating Bc each group is working on the different questions and tasks.

I find a place in the back of my room to put up the answers to the review questions and sometimes hints.  (I use QR code‚Äôs the students can use their phones to validate/seek answers etc).  The reason I put it across the room is that I can use it as assessment...I can see the pace students are working at when they are checking answers and I can also see what groups are going for help more often.  I target the slower groups or ones seeking hints for  guidance and help 1-1.

There are a lot of other things you can do, but this one is easy to start with and implement.  It involves taking something you already will give them (a study guide) and giving it in a different format.  You‚Äôre likely to see struggling students benefit Bc they can ask peers questions and they don‚Äôt get intimidated by the study guide as they deal with questions 1 by 1",1580515253

Yeah I guess it comes down to was she with Franklin at that age? Idk if she ever told us how old they were when they started dating. 

When Eva finally asked Celia what happened. Celia said ‚ÄúI got something in my eye and Kevin helped me wash it out‚Äù.  I think she got something in her eye, a speck of some sort, and she went to Kevin for help. He took that opportunity to ‚Äúhelp wash it out‚Äù with Draino.  And Celia, being young and naive as she is, thought it was the speck that caused all the damage, and Kevin was just genuinely trying to help.  

That‚Äôs how I interpreted it.  I like how it‚Äôs kind of left up for interpretation. I think the way you feel about the different characters, changes the way you interpret some of the incidents.  I hated Kevin early and often. So maybe that‚Äôs why I think this.",1580515254

FF2+ is perfect for microdose, then again going with something small liek dynavap allows for small amounts but then you have to mess with heating the end and then potentially burning yourself which i think is insane.  I don't screw with that.

Alternatively you could go with Glass Sherlock VG Vaporizer or Elev8r glass vaporizer if you want to stick to pure stuff.

I read that extrasynaptic NMDA causes LTP and concurrent extrasynaptic and synaptic NMDA activation cause an LTD effect.

&gt;I'm not able to follow. Your claims don't seem to match up with those wiki links. For example here you seem to imply Liberalism is very specifically a free market system.

&gt;&gt;Liberalism is by definition a free market system.

&gt;This is what the wiki page says.

&gt;&gt;Though all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain ""separate and often contradictory streams of thought"".

&gt;So, no, it's not. But then if you read further it says.

Learning the syntax of languages is secondary to learning why an algorithm is appropriate for the problem.

cheap gas = inflation stays in check and economy gets a boost, plus we don't rely on shitholes to produce it.. Because guess what.  Even though it hurts you to think about it.. WE USE 21 MILLION BBL OF OIL PER FUCKING DAY.. just here in America.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","One of the biological definitions of arms is actually ‚ÄúAnything resembling an arm; as, The fore limb of an animal, as of a bear.‚Äù  And yes, thanks to the wonders of evolution birds, whales and many creatures DO have what are, effectively, arms and legs. Due to how this *arrangement* of bones and muscles offers so many different ways of manifesting, it‚Äôs better to simply refer to them as *limbs*.  Fore limbs of most tetrapods fall into the same arrangement in our own arms. Radius, ulna, humerus, carpals, metacarpals and so on. There are variations but we can easily make out the similarities across the animal kingdom. 

You may evolve but you never stop being what you where - this has been reinforced heavily in modern biological phylogeny. 


The ‚Äúfun fact‚Äù isn‚Äôt just pop culture- it‚Äôs in their name.  Unguligrade of which horses are, means ‚Äúwalks on fingernails‚Äù. It comes from the Latin unguis - as hooves are made of the same material as our own fingernails, keratin. Walking on fingertips could technically be digitigrade, which describes dogs and cats. Apes are plantigrade, which means to talk on the soles of ones feet. 


As for you can‚Äôt seeming into a whale - well, yeah.  Even killer whales are huge, while humans are medium. Seeming cannot change one‚Äôs size beyond 1 foot smaller or taller.  So you‚Äôd have to change to a porpoise or dolphin. Except Cetaceans have lost their hind limbs over years of evolution - they strictly have a tail, with the pelvis only serving primarily for sexual purposes in modern dolphins according to some research. So since they lack hind limbs/legs, you cannot seeming into even a dolphin or porpoise. 

I would like to clarify however, a mistake. I earlier called the joints on the forelimbs of a horse to be the elbow, it is more accurately to describe it as the wrist.",1580515263

* *What are you looking for?:* Newbie-friendly MMORPG, but for thousands of hours. I don't like MMORPGs with almost no endgame content. I'd love to have second life in the game.
* *What games have you previously played?:* Tera Online (2k hours), BDO (300h), 4Story (idk, 6 years as kid in total). Others that I kinda liked: C9, Cabal Online, Metin2, Guild Wars 1, Aion.
* *What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?:* Semi-Casual, sometimes I play just 30 minutes per day, sometimes 6h, anyway I like to progress and climb up in rankings.
* *Any preferred mechanics?:* Very dynamic gameplay. I'd love to play class like Reaper from Tera or Striker from BDO in other MMORPG. Also, I loved PvE instances like those in Tera,
* *Anything specific you want to exclude?:* Solo playing 90% of time like in BDO, I like to play in party/guild from the beginning.",1580515263

I used gimballed aiming mode and never had any flight control problems unless I wanted to for demonstration purposes.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxlIZZj7f2Q&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxlIZZj7f2Q&amp;feature=youtu.be)

And here is a demonstration of what was a bit broken with hover mode, where if you tilted the ship while on land it would just whizz off at 100% speed even if you didn't touch the controls:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1oYg2838kE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1oYg2838kE&amp;feature=youtu.be)

It's an Everyman supercar, with incredible acceleration, great looks, and Audi level reliability, they're great cars, that being said they lack The panache of an Italian car. The soul of the car is cold and calculating and very German. 

AMG on the other hand tend to cost too much for the enjoyment you get out of them, however if you want a Grand touring car that can put power down, nobody does it better... But they're not sports cars. For the most part. 

The 911 is probably the most tame, and ultimately most practical. Ultimately it has almost a zero ""flash"" value... Unless you get something like a GT3
Even then, it's just a whisper of what makes it more special than a bare Bones 911.

There are others, the jags have looked incredible, the f-type for example. For that matter Aston Martin as well
The only thing exceptional and American would be something like a Ford GT, or a new Corvette.... The GT wouldn't be a bad choice, very unique, dripping with looks, and an exclusive car that's hard to get ahold of.... The Corvette has finally transitioned into a supercar... At the low end and a cheap one, but it's a mid-engine rear drive car with 700 horsepower... Nothing to sneeze at, but not very exclusive.

\- Values on the light side are in general pretty close together, or at the very least, the half tones are closer to highlights than to the shadow values

\- Decide on which parts are in shadow and which parts are in light. This is the important first step. With the shape on the left for example, you have made a surface that points upward as dark as the surface in shadow, even slightly darker.

\-In general, form shadows tend to be soft, while cast shadows tend to be sharp.

\- Usually, the darkest part of a form shadow is known as the core shadow, and it's generally the area slightly beyond the terminator (the line that divides the shadow and light side).

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Tell me, what comes to your mind when you hear the term ""Fandom?""

Be thorough. Include every interpretation of the word. 

Oh, and it is basic rules of engagement for any con-goer to never go alone. Strength in numbers. Young ladies like yourself are scouted out by the woefully thirsty and socially awkward, sure, but also the likes of manipulative social vampires and outright creeps who try to exclusively pick up girls at a con. Most people are generally great at conventions, but the more commonplace social outlets and accessible fandoms that are swamped by new people to geekdom, are also areas where the largest amount of predators like to gather. This is nothing exclusive to conventions, however. Sure, any new and upstart social environment is a place that always has this problem. From the alternative scenes back in the day, to the LGBT movement of nowadays. Which in a particularly recent case from Canada, has an undeniable example. 

This doesn't mean that you will have a bad time, however. You can always find someone in a con who can help you make sense of the place, and indeed in most of these places there are security, if push comes to shove. You can still always connect with people over cosplays or the details of the show itself, and most people like to have themselves a good obsessive geek out over things like that.",1580515267

However what I am still uncertain on is how much of an improvement are the other non Direct Drive wheels compared to the G27? The G27 is a wheel that came out many years ago. The Fanatec 2.5 wheel base though is much more recent and is not Direct Drive and is also half the price of the Direct Drive wheel bases that Fanatec offers. 

My budget is sort of floaty at this time. If someone can convince me that the Direct Drive wheel bases are like, 1000% better than the best non-direct drive wheel base, then I might go that route. However, I find that very hard to believe. I feel like any wheel would be an improvement compared to my G27 at this time.",1580515267

"MarvelStrikeForce","t5_4bjjb","I posted this in another thread with the same general topic:

&gt;***Most of the people in the top 2k have 4 to 5 Million TCP and are ALREADY only blitzing 4-6 times per day despite the 2hr cooldown allowing for more, not the other way around--  the people blitzing 10 times a day are the extreme outliers, not the norm.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*I put up 15M+ points and  finished in 1290th in Yo-Yo #2 despite having ""only"" 2.6M TCP. Being  able to blitz more than 6x per day (max possible with a 4-hr timer) is the only way you're going to put up these kinds of numbers in order to match those with 70-80% higher TCP.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I  took the time to look at every profile around my position in the Yo-Yo  Rankings... the result was almost exclusively players with 4M and higher TCP, who would have MUCH higher point totals if they were blitzing  8-9-10 times a day like I was.*

So, making the 4hr timer permanent will actually have the OPPOSITE effect that you want it to... it WILL NOT bring the point totals down, but WILL make it impossible for you to grind up to those totals.

And this, as a direct 2hr. vs. 4hr comparison:

&gt;*By comparison* \[to the recent Quake blitz\]*, Mantis' predictions were only slightly higher than Quake's despite the 2hr Cooldown AND it  being  quarter-blitz.  They were also similar for Elektra, Dr. Strange,  and Night Nurse (lol), etc.... all 2-hr cooldowns, and that's WITHOUT them being quarter-blitz.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*And there's this:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I finished 90th in this week's Quake blitz with 8.4M.I finished 86th in a Deadpool blitz with 8.7M a few months back... the ranking cutoff was for all practical purposes the same for both despite the latter having the 2hr timer.*",1580515267

So the man who threatened to hit me was issued a citation by police for a class C misdemeanor, ""Assault -- Threats,"" (written on the ticket) but not Battery. Nor did he even touch me.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Because your account is new (under 4 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed. Both conditions must be met in their entirety and no exceptions will be made at all.  

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/entitledparents requires all accounts to be at least **4 days old** AND have **at least 100 comment karma** in order to create new threads. Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit.  

Comment karma is *not* the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details. If you're on mobile, use your fucking browser. **Go to https://old.reddit.com/user/me/ to see both kinds of karma.** Use desktop mode. If you claim to have enough comment karma because you don't understand there are 2 kinds of karma, you will be banned.   

The moderators will no longer be manually approving posts. If your post gets removed and you choose to accumulate comment karma, you will need to post your story again; this post will not be automatically restored.  

Questions? Everything you could possibly ask us has been answered. Again: **if you ask us a question that can be answered by this message, you will be banned.**

It took a while to go from ‚Äòoh, this is nothing to worry about, people beat cancer all the time‚Äô to ‚Äòthis is serious, but he‚Äôll make it‚Äô to ‚Äòhe‚Äôs not going to beat this but with modern medicine he‚Äôll still have plenty of time left‚Äô to the phone call I got from my sister that he‚Äôd passed.  

With the gradual decline I did at least have a chance to travel back home and spend some time with him, which I‚Äôm very thankful for.  I still didn‚Äôt want to admit at the time that the last time I said goodbye was goodbye for good though.  

The service was emotional but also cathartic, it did honestly feel good to hear the other people who has been in his life share stories and memories.  

The immediate aftermath was almost a blur just because there was so much stuff that had to be done - helping my mother move accounts, vehicles, etc into her name, doing the ‚Äòshake hands and accept condolences‚Äô routine with relatives I hadn‚Äôt seen in over a decade (though I did obviously appreciate them coming out), helping my mother go through his things and pick what she wanted to keep out and what should be packed away, etc. 

The full impact probably didn‚Äôt even hit me until I‚Äôd flown back home after the funeral.  It would manifest in unexpected ways, like I‚Äôd see a promo for a movie and think ‚Äúoh, I bet dad would like that, I should tell him about it‚Äù or I‚Äôd go to a new restaurant and think ‚Äúoh, this type of place is right up dad‚Äôs alley, I should bring him here the next time he visits‚Äù only for the reality to hit me a moment later.  

As with all things time heals the wounds, and I can remember the good times with him without that tinge of loss for the most part.  When I cook one of the recipes he taught me, read the book series‚Äô he introduced me to, or listen to some of the music he loved and that was always playing when I was growing up I generally feel a warmth of his memory instead of the empty pang of loss now.",1580515271

So if a veteran comes in with his/her three kids, the military discount is ONLY applied to the burger he/she ate. The discount will not be applied towards ANY drinks, or anything the kids ate/drank, even though the veteran is the one paying for the ENTIRE ticket. I personally think that if they‚Äôre paying for everything, the discount should go towards what they are paying for. Our restaurant does a lot of other things that I would consider to be ‚Äúcheap‚Äù in order to save every last cent they can get. I understand that a restaurant is a very expensive business to keep running so it‚Äôs important to save money wherever possible, but I personally feel that if John over at table 3 risked his life to ensure that you have the freedom to continue running said restaurant, then he deserves that 10% discount on EVERYTHING he‚Äôs paying for, not only what he personally consumed.

"buffy","t5_2sd68","Just like Spuffy, the whole dilemna of Cangel was not whether or not the relationship would work but whether or not the feelings were there in the first place. They made a whole subplot of Angel never being sure enough of how he felt to say the L word to Cordelia in 6 years of knowing her. Even in his supposedly ""perfect day"" fantasy (which has a lot of parallels with the ""Surprise"" episode), he did not even feel the need to tell her that he loved her before jumping in bed with her (awkward lack of chemistry there btw). When you compare that to the unconditional and ardent way he cherished and desired Buffy (and never had any doubts about it), his interest in Cordelia feels really situational and insincere in comparison. Not to mention, my own personal experiences have biased me to the notion that if a person hasn't been your first option the whole time you knew them, you very likely are not really in love with them, just settling. In the end, the only thing I need to discredit Cangel as a legit endgame pairing is that as long as being with Buffy in ANY way remains an actual option, Cordelia does not even register on Angel's radar. For him, it was always Buffy and always will be Buffy. Any fanfiction who'd makes a shanshued Angel choose Cordelia over an alive and available Buffy is just OOC wish fulfilment.",1580515272

"korea","t5_2qiog","&gt;50 university students trying to get a job as a security guard

Exaggerated but sort of true. There are many examples of jobs where university students are in high competition to get it but security guard usually isn't one of them. But low level government or office positions that would seem pretty meager definitely suffer from over-competition. Think about it like this: jobs that take actual physical work (security guard is one) nobody wants. Sit down jobs like at an office with your own desk EVERYBODY wants and can be really hard to get.

&gt;loan sharks

Absolutely yes. More than in places like USA. In other countries people will go to payday loans or like that when they are in poverty and need cash. Korea has those places too but there are also plenty of loan sharks who will hound you to pay up. In fact some families will move pretty often just to try to avoid them.

&gt;semi-basements

Absolutely yes. I know lots of families who grew up living in semibasements and it sucked because of the dampness and yeah sometimes in rain it will flood but not like the giant flood in the movie (that can happen but it's like once in 5 years or something) 

Other stuff yeah the movie is basically right about. But for me the sticking points were like this: that family in insanely clever. Way more than a normal poverty family will be. Another thing is nowadays so many officetel are built so if those kids have like ANY drive (you can see they do) they would GTFO asap and move to their own oneroom and leave the parents in that shitty place. 

On the other hand the rich family in the movie is insanely rich if they live in that area. That is like 0.5% of Korea society. Most ""rich"" people don't live like that. 

Actually there's a kind of rule of thumb: if you live in your own house in Korea you are either super rich or super poor. Super rich because you could afford an actual detached house in a very nice area where the land price is insane but you have the cash to use that land JUST for 1 house and not a high density complex! Or super poor because you live in some old shack built by handwork 50 years ago and can't afford to move into even a shitty building that would have safer electric work and isn't crumbling. 

My take anyway",1580515273

"smallbusiness","t5_2qr34","I think this is a great idea. I‚Äôve seen it before and it worked on me (a fellow marketer)

I was buying a road bike last year and was shopping at lots of different bike shops (each shop carries different brands). One of the shops let me test ride several bikes. They tried to get me to pull the trigger but I told them I was going to keep looking at a few other shops. 

So what they did was give me a coupon that was good for 3 days for $150 off a bike (most bikes in this shop are $2k and up). It was a physical voucher and I‚Äôd never gotten anything like it before. Since it‚Äôs worth $150, I kept it around and took care of it. I went to a few other shops, and none of them offered me anything when I left. 

3 days later I went back and got a bike at that shop and used the $150 off voucher. It worked great for them. Then they upsold me $100 in warranty that probably cost them nothing, so it was even better for them. I was happy because then I felt like I was getting a free warranty. 

All in all, they secured a sale. The limited timeline on the voucher also sped up my timeline. I probably would have waited another week or two but the three day timeline got me back exactly 3 days later. I think it‚Äôs a great deal. Of course you only want to offer it when you know there is no chance for a sale that day. If it doesn‚Äôt work, then it‚Äôs no skin off your back (costs you nothing other than 5¬¢ in printing expense for the coupon). If it works then it‚Äôs a sale you may not have gotten otherwise.

Florida has gone Red 5 of 8 elections. Meaning FL and OH are closer to bipartisan tha CA and NY. Also they have a lower pooulation than CA alone. So don't gimme that crap that these are even remotely similar. 

Last I checked the U.S. was a union of states, not a cluster of people. Every state counts, not just whichever state can shove the most people in it. Without the electoral college to states with the highest populations would dictate the states that, coincidentally, produce the most tangible goods. Just look up water distribution vs location in the state of CA. That is what happens on a small scale when rural regions are overruled by urban areas.

You may not see a pic of her.

I think she wanted a kid cause it would lock some poor guy into giving her a free ride through life.

She told me about two of them after I refused to get back together after the 0300 phone call, so I‚Äôm pretty sure she was fucking  around on me the entire time we were together, multiple nights where she was supposed to be home by 9-10  ommunications were dead silent and sometimes she would be gone for more than 24 hours at a shot, she claimed she was clean but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she was using in secret. 

No she landed some 45 year old when she moved back to Ontario, few months later she was pregnant.  She was in her early 20s

She ended up having two kids with him.  And from what she told me she accused him of all the same shit she used to assume me of, I only know this cause she contacted me after about a year.

I think the worst I remember is a classmate who did their cardiac rehab rotation later than originally scheduled because they struggled with identifying heart sounds &amp; rhythms in the sim lab. Some people in my program had never set foot in a clinical setting, so we did a lot of role playing for interviewing &amp; interacting with patients (and their families). That was as important as practicing assessment skills.

I get your point of view.  While I'm a woman I haven't worn dresses or skirts since the single digits and will not do so in the future.  I didn't wear what might be traditionally expected of a bride *to my own wedding.*  I'm certainly not doing so for someone else's wedding.

At the same time, I've *never agreed to be a bridesmaid* in a traditional ceremony because I'm aware there are expectations that you may need to conform in some way as to the marrying couple's expectations for looks.  That might include makeup, hair, dressed, colors, level or formality &amp; overall appearance.  

I think that your sister, facing the strings that come with Other People's Money^TM is between a rock &amp; a hard place with your parents' demands.  She's caved.  So at this point the gracious thing to do it to say while you'd be happy to attend the wedding as a guest, you're realizing you cannot meet the duties of a bridesmaid and have thus opted to back out of being in the wedding party.

The reason for this is hopefully you'll go with cameras that record locally rather than a cloud service that has questionable interests, and for your own privacy it is better to not let the cameras be on the same VLAN and subnet as the devices you want to access the internet and have personal data on.  You can easily distinguish them this way and put them on either another router port or on a different VLAN to segment them off.

If you get good access points, such as Ubiquiti's line, you might also put different wireless devices on different VLANs as well. Either that or put all wireless on a separate VLAN or router port. This again is for security and privacy reasons. Why should a smart speaker, if you get those, be able to talk to your laptop and potentially be used to cause security issues that put your privacy at risk?

Every customer, from 3 major corporation stores, which is probably anywhere between 500-2,000 customers per day, per store, each with dozens of locations across the banned county. All of that is new paper needing to cut down trees for. 

Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking ""Damn, these republicans will cut their own nose to spite their face"". Here's the thing.......this was a democrat push for that law. Republicans tried to block it. Its one of the few times I agree with the republicans on local politics.

I don't even know how to explain that even though he promised he would come back, still love me, be proud of how I handled things I still felt abandoned. The physical presence was gone and I can't ease my heart and mind that he was coming back. My struggle caused suicidal thoughts and the deep feeling that I needed to run and get away before I got hurt. All that did was cause him to seek comfort elsewhere and withdraw. And so the cycle continued... I am working so hard on my abandonment issues now. He has been patient, but the pressure is overwhelming to him at times.

What happens if the offense manages those 10 yards? Do they get 4 attempts again?

When and why do the kicks happen? There's one after a touchdown by the scoring team, but why? When and why else is there a kick?

How many players are there? Is the roster for defense and offense completely different or do players take up roles for both situations?

And most importantly: Why is it even called football?",1580515281

I don't know why, it might be similar to why a lot of people dislike rolling low, despite there being no concrete reason for this.

(On the other hand, they like it when rolls that have special bonuses use different dice. I think this is because lets them kind of track the bonus and their base skill separately. E.g. ""gee, I would have failed with my d20 roll, but that extra d6 you gave me pushed me over the line!"")",1580515281

After that, I went to a 'newbie' modded server with very little people on it (like 0 most of the time) and a huge map of like 30x30 tiles, except I then realized that everything was just a giant grind to get not that far.

It's just that post war analysis allows us to see that the use of them wasn't necessarily needed for a Japanese surrender. Although we can look at it and see that they did help end the war, we don't know that if they weren't used and the Soviet's declared war all the same that the same result would of happened. In fact, given the strategic bombing survey it's likely that the Soviet declaration of war would of upturned the same results.

My point as well is that glorifying the use of the nukes in the form of a mascot would be the same as having the Twin Towers as a mascot in the Middle East, or even having a baby falling onto a bayonet as a mascot in Japan. It glorifies the deaths of innocent people who happened to get caught up in the war The mass killing of any civilian population is an atrocity no matter the circumstance, this IS an objective truth. Whether or not the killings are justified, acknowledging that the deaths of civilians is needed. Even the USAAF when they dropped the bombs understood this as for they asked the civilians to leave via leaflets. Killing civilians is horrible, even when needed",1580515283

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Some good info on these findings found on a comment in a linked article. 

""All four of the identified amino acid insertions are extremely short and are found in the genomes of many other organisms, not just HIV. In other words, the primary finding of this work are entirely a highly expected coincidence.

All organisms contain a DNA code that has the genetic instructions for development, functioning, and growth - this is known as the ""genome"". You can imagine each genome as a book of instructions. What these authors did is look in the genome book of the 2019 novel coronavirus and identified 4 sets of letters that aren't found in the genome book of SARs, a related coronavirus. They then compared these letters to the genome book of HIV, and found some places where they looked somewhat similar - but not even identical. However, because these sets of letters were so short, they are often found in many genome books by chance - they way you might search for the phrase ""can be there"" in Google Books and find that thousands of books contain those words - but this is not an example of plagarism.

Note here: We call these sets of letters ""insertions"" because they are in one genome, but not in a close relative - ""insertion"" does not imply human interference or engineering - it is an evolutionary term and refers to a natural evolutionary mutation.

Here are the four insertions:

TNGTKR

HKNNKS

RSYLTPGDSSSG

QTNSPRRA

These four insertions are protein sequences, that are encoded by a DNA sequence (which you may know uses molecular ""letters"" of A, G, C, and T to encode for proteins, which uses 20 molecular amino acid ""letters"").

You, dear reader, do not have to take anybody's word for it that these letters are a concidence - you can do the bioinformatics yourself!

If you would go to:
https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih....

You will arrive at a search engine for these genome books, kind of like the Google of biology. Click on ""Protein Blast"", because are going to search for these protein sequences.

Under where it says ""Enter accession number"", you can paste any one of the four sequences above.

And then you can hit the ""BLAST"" button at the bottom of the screen. In a few minutes you will get a set of results.

Let's go through the results for the longest sequence, ""RSYLTPGDSSSG"", together.

Under the ""Description"" field you can see resulting hits. The first hit you see is to ""spike glycoprotein [Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus]"" - this is good, because we know that this sequence came from this genome. Under ""Per. Id"" you can see the similarity of this sequence to other hits - in this case, you can start by seeing that this sequence is also found in Bat coronavirus, so isn't actually novel at all! And there are many comparative hits that as equally as good, or often better, than the HIV comparison.

Let's then take a look at the second sequence, ""HKNNKS"", together.

If you go through the same search process for this sequence and look again at the results, you can see hundreds of perfectly identical matches. Maybe you see Sipha flava - that's an Aphid, or Tetrahymena - that's an Amoeba. Drosophila is a fruit fly. Clearly this sequence is found in thousands of genomes.

Fortunately, the search has a built in way of answering the question ""How likely was this result to have occurred by chance?"". It is called the E-value, or Expect Value - the number of times we'd expect to see this result purely by chance. As you can see here, many of the E-values listed on this page are greater than 7829 - so we'd have expected to see 7829 instances of matches like these completely by chance! This is not evidence for gene transfer or gene similarity - it's simply a coincidence. As you now search for the other insertions described by this paper, you'll see that all of them hit hundreds of other genomes simply by chance. It is no surprise at all that they could have matches with some similarity in the HIV genome.

Congratulations! You are now a more careful and proficient bioinformatician than the authors of this paper.""

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","You continue to miss the point completely or willfully be pedantic to the point you can't see the forrest for the trees.   


All you've done is narrowed down your point even further, to apply literally only to you and your schooling district. What you described is not what the majority of the country has. So while in your specific bubble you may be right, in the majority of the country this is not so.   


Either you lived in a great school district with high incomes, or as you say you lived in a large diverse district, which further discredits your point, because that is not remotely the experience of most in the country. We have to remember that NYC of all places has the most segregated schooling system in the country. Most places don't have high wages for their entry level teachers, and a $100k+ tier that doesn't take ages to age into, and a system that protects teachers from facing reprimands or consequences for even the blatant misuse of funds like you seem to describe.  


If I were to tell you that plenty of teachers have to buy their own supplies that they use with the children like arts supplies etc, would you say that in your district all that is covered and not an expense for the teachers directly? That wouldn't change the fact that many places force teachers to subsidize children's educations directly out of pocket.   


Maybe your district is actually the perfect district and that should be expanded everywhere. The point of the matter is that it is not currently the norm throughout the nation. It being so in 1 place, does not mean no changes should be made.   


Also as an aside, if the problem you had with that teacher was that they lied and misused funds by assigning a substitute while doing something other than teaching, you could have said that. The affair is completely irrelevant to the matter. That whole point seemed driven by pure moral outrage in your first comment, completely sidestepping the real reason they should have faced any consequences.",1580515285
"legostarwars","t5_2tpjq","That was a BIG problem and the EU had a relatively simple explanation: it was 200,000 Battalions, with a million more on the way, eventually reaching something like 3 million Battalions (a Battalion is 576 Clones plus officers so the total is something like 7 or 8 Billion Clones).

Other sources tried to explain it differently as well (e.g. one stated 16 million more clones were ordered, Republic Commando threw in Spaarti Clones, etc.), but the Battalions explanation was basically universally accepted, more or less.

In the New Canon they have confirmed it is 1.2 million individual clones, plus the \~6 million more ordered in an episode of *The Clone Wars*. Despite the fact that literally isn't even enough clones to crew all the ships at the Battle of Coruscant in the start of Episode III which would require approximately \~9.5 million Clones (give or take, I did the exact math over in r/MawInstallation a few weeks ago but don't remember).",1580515285

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Farm Boy who gets magic sword is actually surprisingly rare in literature - it's a staple in RPGs and adventure games, and about as common as ""they met in an inn"" for D&amp;D, but in literature ... not so much.  Even in the Hobbit, Bilbo is effectively a middle aged local landowner, although he does get a magic sword.  

Lloyd Alexander's Prydain is probably the best fit overall, but it really isn't cliche ridden.  

Eddings' Belgariad has the farmer's nephew who goes on adventures then eventually gets a magic sword.  It's pretty much the only big example.  

Elizabeth Moon's Deed of Paksenarrion starts with Paks fleeing her family farm, never to return.  The rest of it mostly fits, although it takes a while to get the magic sword.  

Weis and Hickman's Darksword trilogy has the farmboy make his own *anti-magic* sword.  Fights plenty of fantasy creatures though.  

Carrot in Guards Guards in the Discworld is technically the son of a miner, he has one of the most unmagical swords the local wizard had ever seen, and ends up fighting a dragon.  Not really any quests involved though.",1580515285

I do care. Everyone should care, regardless of political affiliation the basic groundwork of our government is established in the constitution. It is a despicable and sad thing that these republican senators have collectively decided that Congress is not a co-equal branch of government any more, they've reduced their own power and authority and have given it to the president. No citizen should be above the law, including the president. 

The precedent this sets, if trump is acquitted in this trial with no witnesses, what's to stop future presidents from ignoring congress? If the president can't be held accountable to anyone, then what does that mean for the future of our government?

Congress holds the power of impeachment, that's in the constitution. If the branches of government are supposed to be co-equal, and the executive decides not to listen to the legislative, as was done in this case when the White House refused to turn over documents, and there's absolutely no consequence of that, how are the powers equal?

If you hear voices (father or not), seek professional help.  No fooling.  If the voices tell you to kill... no, it's not God or a demon or whatever. It's a serious mental health problem.

The command of Elohim in this passage is evil.  That's an easy one.  The Bible says as much in other places.  Yahweh countermands this evil instruction.  Yahweh saves the child.

These are not tricky issues.  It's not a head-scratcher.  This one is just so easy.  A combination of terrible translation, asleep-at-the-wheel pastoral guidance, and anti-intellectual innerantism have conspired to create a mysterious moral dilemma where there is none.

i know I‚Äôm a competitive applicant for most schools, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I just can‚Äôt afford it. it doesn‚Äôt help that my essays weren‚Äôt amazing either. i had really cool and inspiring stuff to talk about in them but I just did not have the time to polish them to the level that I would‚Äôve wanted.

this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm considering because I‚Äôve heard of rags to riches stories. it‚Äôs because I have an idea that I believe in. i haven‚Äôt been influenced by anyone else or anyone else‚Äôs stories to consider this. 

and if my business would fail, I‚Äôd probably just suck it up and go 50k in debt for a college degree.  but I have a lot of faith in it and tbh the only reason why it hasn‚Äôt happened yet is because I don‚Äôt have the funding and I‚Äôm not 18 yet. but despite my age, i have a lot of experience starting successful companies and can generally tell when something is going to work or not. I‚Äôve researched my idea inside and out and i have a solid understanding of what it entails. idk I guess I‚Äôm just thinking that if college doesn‚Äôt pan out in terms of cost, this might be the opportunity i need to start the business. and if college does pan out, it is something I‚Äôd do anyway once I get enough funding. idk.",1580515291

I mean, the CEO left the company in a mess. The investor should have shut it down, but believed in the product.

Draglubion has 8, seven sins has 12 and the other rank 8 you summoned (hope harbinger for quick spells or photon lord for nibiru etc) has 8. 1+12+8+8=29 Through Draglubion's effect only Numeron can attack that turn, but yeah.

"AskMenOver30","t5_2y9pw","I still like new music/artists but probably a lower percentage than when I was younger. Some of it is because I've heard so much great music in my life it's getting more rare to come across a novel sound. This may be the case with a lot of us as we age. 

I've always wanted to avoid becoming the old guy who thinks everything was better back in the day, so I make a deliberate effort to keep my ear open to some of the newer things out there. I find that today's artists are, on the whole, just as talented as the popular ones from my youth - but radio has changed its tastes in ways I don't like. 

Traditional radio still has enormous influence on which new artists break through, and they seem to have gone away from promoting artists who are reasonably talented vocalists or who use actual instruments on their songs. 

That's my biggest gripe - that singing and jamming/playing have somehow taken a backseat to artists who don't seem to know much about music aside from having an ear for catchy digital beats. I like a lot of that stuff as well, but I don't think it should be considered the standard for quality.",1580515295

I did not have time to dig into the court record myself, so I asked in the comments if anyone had a link to court decision directly. 

As a lawyer, I refuse to take any news opinion as to what was/wasn't decided by a court decision without reading it myself. News media often reports dicta as holdings, or fails to note significant findings in their reporting. You just get more information from reading the actual documents yourself. 

This holds true for any news story about any court decision. I have yet to find a single scenario where the news reports all relevant findings, or does so without glaring misrepresentations of the court's significant holdings. 

My comments/views have nothing to do with this story specifically, or the specific news source used here. They are born of a natural distrust of news outlets in their competency reporting on court cases, specifically after the Hot Coffee incident.",1580515296

He was walking in the way that I was approaching, so of course we both stop. I look at him and give him a smile and nod to let him know he could go first. Problem is, he didn't make any eye contact with me and kept his head down then proceeded to walk around two machines to get past me. 

I just remember thinking, he reminded me of myself when I was a kid. And I was a popular mark for bullies. 

I've known asian guys that command respect without acting like buffoony bro dudes but there's definitely a stereotype that asians are timid and passive. The black community had defiant figures like Malcolm X and Jack Johnson and I think this is because racism hit black people a lot harder so the blowback matched the intensity we were hit with. 

I've seen more and more asians developing awareness on their specific issues though so I think it's only a matter of time before the world starts to acknowledge it as well and watch their behavior.",1580515296

16 female in HS with social anxiety issues. I have a couple of friends, but not many. I'm not a huge talker,and sometimes freeze up in social situations.

Anyway, theres this loner girl in my year who has been pestering me since we started school to be friends. I've tried hanging out with her, but we just don't vibe well, nor do we have anything in common. She's not a particularly nice person either, she once hit me for not participating in a class discussion, among other things.

Anyway, my mum found out about her and keeps trying to pressure me to be friends with her. Telling me I will end up a very lonely person and why would I give up this oppurtunity to be friends with someone. It's constant. She knows where my mum parks, and she goes and has conversations with her, she has my mum feeling sorry for her.  I told my mum how she treats me and my mum just brushes off saying ""shes just lonely, you should feel sorry for her, she wants to be your friend""

One day, at school she asked me something personal, I told her I would rather not say. She kept trying to get it out of me, but I still very politely refused. After school, she went and found my mums car and told her that I refused to tell her. My mum told her instead, and when I got to the car she gave me this lecture about why I wouldn't talk to this person, and that I'm going to end up lonely if I don't start talking to people etc etc.

I have a couple of good friends already that I am more than happy to share things with, why should I have to be friends with this person, just because shes desperate to be my friend?

&gt; A.M.A.Z.O., was a nanotechnogical creation of the late Professor Ivo. Amazo's nanotechnology enabled him to copy any trait and characteristic of people and objects, by merely looking at them.

&gt; Originally, Amazo had the ability to copy one's powers, natural abilities, equipment, and DNA signature simply by looking at them.

&gt; Amazo first used his ability to replicate superhuman attributes and weaponry from six of the seven founding members of the Justice League. Subsequently, during Amazo's travels through the universe, he evolved to a nigh-omnipotent state that could easily outmatch the whole expanded League. In his enhanced state, he has flight, super strength, invulnerability, vast energy manipulation, psionic powers like telepathy and telekinesis, super-hearing, can teleport himself across unknown distances, shrink into a subatomic universe, shunt entire planets to other dimensions and just as easily bring them back unharmed with a blink of an eye. Amazo could effortlessly break through a force field created from the combined power of a few dozen Green Lanterns.

&gt; All of these enhancements have made Amazo quite possibly the single most powerful being ever known in the DCAU. Luthor also called A.M.A.Z.O. ""the most powerful creature in the universe"".",1580515300

I personally prefer the mechanics of M3, because you have an actual incentive to use different gear throughout the game. Problem is, it can get REALLY random at times, like doing very limited damage and having all enemies do extra damage while shooting 2x the bullets. And an issue I'm running into is that enemies still die way too fast sometimes. Especially if I get modifier that are actually in my favour.

Popheads clearly wanted to tell Robyn what to do‚Ä¶.

**Rosesmp3** This whole album is so full of classic songs that ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fucking Tell Me What to Do‚Äù always gets overlooked. One of my favorites.

**Ditacarlita** I can't imagine there being any song worse in this rate so it automatically gets a 0.

**Jexan13** repetitive but so relatable

**Waluigiest** She has songs like this (e.g. Beach 2k20) and they're all phenomenal. Mechanical club banger!!

**Qustomar** i think the lyrics r pretty good but musically the song is boring asf, there's no progression it just stays in the same spot

God this song is so bad like it's just awful I cannot truly express how much I dislike this song. This is a stain on an otherwise exceptional album

I love how weird and experimental this song is while still being listenable. Her droning voice over those robotic beats, it‚Äôs a neat effect.

My student loans are killing me. My depression is killing me. My closeted sexuality is killing me. My self destructive tendencies are killing me.

This song hits different.

i think the lyrics r pretty good but musically the song is boring asf, there's no progression it just stays in the same spot

Doesn't seem like much at first lyrically, but the repetition really pulls the whole song together. Just saying 'Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do' is the perfect thing after all that bullshit.",1580515300

Title: **Is the dealership/ bank legally allowed to change our contract?**

Original Post: 

&gt; My bf is financing a car from a used car dealership as of two days ago. They just called and want him to go up there tomorrow because they or the bank apparently calculated wrong and say that his YTD is literally $16 less than what they‚Äôre looking for. 
&gt; We have all the paperwork and the title and signed the million pieces of paper for it already. 
&gt; So, are they allowed to change the agreed amount of the payments? ($300/month) Because they did their calculation wrong?
&gt; I‚Äôm actually not even sure if they‚Äôre looking to raise the payments or change the interest rate or what. The sales guy wasn‚Äôt very descriptive and just wants him to bring more paystubs tomorrow..
&gt; (Having other problems with them as well.)

"cars","t5_2qhl2","For my car, changing the modes will change the following:

* Steering weight
* Suspension stiffness
* Throttle response
* Exhaust tone (leave it in Track nearly all the time anyhow)
* Rev hang

Tour gets the most usage out of me. For day-to-day driving on shitty LA roads, the soft suspension and light steering is nice. The revs hang a bit which is nice for lazy shifting. Throttle response is geared more towards light modulation, so most of the power and torque comes early and bottoms out around 50-60%.

Sport comes out when I'm in the mood for a bit more pep. Throttle reponse gets pushed more midrange, rev hangs lesson for quicker shifting, and the suspension and steering weight pick up a bit.

Track never gets used exclusively. The steering weight is artificially heavy and doesn't feel good. Throttle response gets pushed to the top end, so early-to-mid modulation doesn't feel linear in power delivery. The suspension gets a bit stiff for normal roads but it handles corners like it's on rails. I'll throw the suspension here when I'm canyon carving, otherwise, I never touch it.",1580515301

Perhaps you might bruise less in the same spot if your circulation is decreased there due to damage to the capillary network. Repetitive bruising of the muscles can lead to myositis ossificans where some of the injured muscle gets ossified and you get little calcium deposits growing in your muscle, this is seen sometimes in things like around the groins of people who ride on a saddle a lot.

All in all the bruises you get are probably not going to be significant healthwise, but they shouldn't be mistaken for a positive thing that will make you tougher (otherwise we would be intentionally bruising ourselves to train).

This lets u see the linear combinations of that gives you the general solution. Here‚Äôs some work for one of the problems.

I've been that way my whole life and it means I'd literally rather go to the dentist/have any medical procedure done than go to a social event. What is typical friendly touch, noise, sound, interaction and mingling for me is *hell*.

My point here is that growing up people kept forcing me to socialize in these sort of standard ways and environments because ""it was good for me"" and they thought eventually it would change my temperament. All it did was overwhelm and overload me and I'd end up overstimulated and then eventually shut down and miserable. I'd be so strung out I would get migraines and literally be sick. My anxiety would spike and I'd do anything to avoid the most everyday tiny interactions with anyone.
If people are kind and slow and understanding of my needs, then I can open up and enjoy socializing in my own way and in my own time.

Socializing is only good if it is positive for the organism. If it isn't you're just creating stress and further confirming for your dog (in this case) that other dogs are a problem. Even in the minority of cases where your dog eventually is left to acclimate she still doesn't enjoy it from the get go.

Stop forcing the dog park on her.
If she can politely cross another dog on a walk that's good enough.

There isn't much distance from the black knight targets and the drain.  Moreover, if your shots aren't great, you run the risk of the ball flying right back at you and heading for the drain or outlanes.  Your only hope is nudging enough but not tilting to save the ball, hitting MagnaSave early enough if the ball is flying to the right, or hoping your virtual kickback is on to the left :-) .  


It's a very physical game :-).  People shouldn't be abusing it of course, but nudging is a part of pinball.  If you don't like to nudge/shake games, I recommend not playing it unless you have pinpoint accuracy flipping :-).  


The other Black Knights are almost the same ... but BKSoR makes nudging an almost mandatory skill if you want to beat it :-).",1580515309

If people got rewarded relatively equally for participating and the person spamming only got a bit more than the others, I would expect most people to be cool with it because everyone completes the mission easier, faster, and at the expense of the spammer (duplicated traps or crafted traps).

Sure, if you're trying to craft a clever tunnel the spam will ruin it either way, but so could bumbling non-spamming players. 

And the scoring system would still be horribly broken even if the trap spam is fixed. So instead of trap spam it's a PL131 coming into your PL50 mission, trying to play the mission straight, but due to the ability imbalance gets all the points anyway. 

Fix the scoring system and the incentives to trap spam decrease tremendously; when it does occur it will be an annoyance for the most part but a benefit in some cases.",1580515311

I started watching the show back when it premiered in 2014, and is honestly the first show I've followed from start to finish. It's given me some of the best belly laughs and chuckles, and has also made me bawl like a child. I've always felt a certain connection to BoJack, even more now that he goes to rehab in the final season. When I first left treatment, the first half of Season 6 had come out already and everything I had done there was reflected in the show. Seeing him go through the steps...well, it was me at that moment. So to say that I am emotionally invested in the show is an understatement. They portray addiction, depression, and recovery so damn well. The View From Halfway Down was such a goddamn powerful episode. If you haven't ever watched BoJack before....just do it. Start from the beginning and just watch the show.

The United States profited hundreds of billions of dollars in dividends and interest from the money it lent out during the 2008 crisis. This money was collected by the US government and reduced the burden of taxation on American citizens.  It is one of the few great things Obama did.  The only reasonable argument you could make for these loans being 'socialism' is that they were given at relatively low interest rates.

Got home super excited, ran to my room powered on the snes, and the game was totally cartoony. I was so angry (I had major anger issued back then as a kid) i ripped the cartridge out and slammed it again the corner of my tv stand, promptly hearing a crack. I flipped it over and i had broken through the back of the cartidge.

But digging up the darkest parts of your character is too tempting an opportunity to pass up for professional actors. One of them would have put their foot down (probably Jester, Caduceus, or Yasha) before anyone could go in there to make a serious offer.

Jester going in there guaranteed that there would be no more bargaining. She would either succeed and walk away a great trickster, or she would fail and very likely initiate combat.

I'd chalk it up to a difference between players of a theatrical background and just pure gamers. D&amp;D doesn't have to strictly be about combat. You can have an entire campaign without violence, and sometimes non-violent resolutions are more interesting than battle. Certainly the case here.",1580515313

If it's genetic and Asta was just born without mana, then the same trait could potentially be passed on to his children, but if the reason Asta has no mana is because it was somehow taken from him when he was a baby or while he was in his mother's womb (like if forbidden magic or Spade Kingdom technology is involved), then the risk of his children inheriting the trait is probably low because it is not something related to his genetics.",1580515314

"careerguidance","t5_2t9i0","I don't think longevity at previous jobs should have anything to do with it. Good candidates have options, and not many companies value them enough to do what they need to do to keep them. I read recently that millennials are creating trends of lower tenure at jobs and leaving quickly for better options. I think the older generations had to deal with looser labor laws that made them have to commit more than the employers did. And that's why we have this bullshit culture in the states where you have to work through your vacations or be viewed as lazy. Fuck that noise. I will provide my employer as much respect as they offer me. An example - my father, a boomer in his 60s, practically killed himself for his employer for 30+ years. 80+ hour weeks every week, late nights, still on the phone and computer at home, trying to find wifi on vacation to send reports, etc. He has a heart condition and panic attacks from the stress. He ran a great company and was incredibly valued by his staff. His reward? He was unceremoniously fired the day he returned from vacation because ""we need more numbers and we're going in a different direction"". Not even a write up in his career. But now fuck off. They replaced him with a sleezebag half his age for half the price. The guy has run the place into the ground in less than 3 months, with potential lawsuits for harrassment in the works, and half their best employees jumping ship. That's what loyalty gets you folks. 

My first career was 15 years of commitment and then they mutually agreed to let me go because I was too expensive and am a woman with opinions. I was running my own department making more profit than any other department, but I hated the executive management team and their backwoods idiotic business ideas as much as I annoyed them with my expectations - logic, reason, and providing employees the resources they needed to do their jobs. Glad I left, kinda miss the industry, would not return.

My second career was 3.5 years tenure. I started at the bottom willingly, did not need a lot of money at the time due to spouse making bank, so my pay was to keep our lifestyle where we wanted it. I advanced into management in less than six months and was running a multi million dollar sales floor with 30+ employees in less than three years. I was becoming stressed and weary that the company was placing unrealistic expectations on sales staff and getting rid of extremely valuable personnel because they weren't hitting the targets. People who worked there for decades, treated customers like gold, won customer service and sales awards, and lost sleep at night thinking they could never do enough. The culture was starting to grate on me. Also, I knew my location would be closing when the lease was up (then two years away) and there was no relocation option that allowed me to stay in my current city, which I don't really want to leave. So I knew I needed a new job eventually, but wasn't actively looking. A friend called me and told me about the Logistics job I'm in now. Slightly better pay, no teams to manage, hourly (aka overtime), 8-5 M-F vs retail hours, virtually no dress code, and I get to sit at a desk vs running miles in heels for rich, ungrateful assholes every day. It was a no brainer. I put in my notice the following week.

This job was literally perfect for about the first year. I actually cried (I dont cry) telling family how much I loved it, and loved my coworkers, and loved our software systems (a big metric for me), and how my managers let us be autonomous and stood behind us when disputes arose. Then, corporate took over for the shareholders and we were absorbed into F500 fuck-the-end-user culture. So much good talent has already left nationwide because of the toxic corporate culture. We've begged them for adequate staffing so we can do our jobs thoroughly and correctly the first time, and we get nothing. Well nothing except incessant emails from corporate billing, IT, pricing, legal, etc telling us how to to our jobs according to how they think it should be done. And it can NEVER be done that way, but then they make us explain why and after a 50+ email chain going around in circles we get nowhere. I just can't take it anymore. I took this job for less stress, and I will not settle for this lack of work life balance.

So, onward and upward to the next adventure.

Edit: To add that I specifically do not want to move up the ladder. I want to come to work, do my job well, and go home. If my job stayed the way it was when I started I probably would have retired here, in the same job.",1580515317

It's an easy way to support the parks and it'll keep people out that need to be kept out. Like...the homeless. My views on the homeless are opposite of a lot of people I think. I feel like we need to help them out and do MORE for them. Give them a safe place to live because shelters are NOT safe. I guess my view is different because I've had to stand in line at a food bank because all our money was going towards keeping a roof over our heads, not our food. And we're in the same sort of pickle now too, money's running low and we have to start cutting out certain things to keep the house, pay the bills and so on and so forth. I might have to go back to standing in line at the food bank. It's a serious struggle and I'm just lucky we haven't lost the house yet.

I thought I'd just say that to clarify I'm not against the homeless like a lot of people in Seattle are...but I am against them camping in public land like city parks. They ruin it for everyone and they can easily trash the place/set fires. We don't need to risk our beautiful parks...we need to keep the paywall up.",1580515317

Confirm on Release:

Press edit button, &gt; press and hold left click &gt; select tiles &gt; release left click 

One's 6 actions, the other is 5 actions.

Confirm on release will be slower at first because of muscle memory, and having to relearn not holding left click to turbo build through an edit, but it is definitely faster for just raw editing due the less coordination required, rather than actions specifically.

"dresdenfiles","t5_2s64c","Wasn't it stated that Nicodemus has the ability to just pick someone to die once each year?  That's HOW he was going to take Harry out until Shiro substituted himself.  So if he decided to target the White Council, he could just nip them off one a year, starting with Langry, then Eb, etc. etc. etc.

I think Nic's motivations are much more complex than just wanting to destroy humanity.  I think he's *willing* to kill lots of people if it means boosting his power, but other than that I think people are largely irrelevant to him.  His goal is somehow related to defeating the Outsiders, and to a large degree that aligns with the goals of the White Council.  So I don't think he's much interested in the Council, except to the extent they interfere with his plans.",1580515318

I agree with this sentiment out of an idea of respecting the authors work, I just find it disrespectful to position yourself as a fan but not take the time to read the original work.

One time shortly after finishing a 5K run, another time was just stopping at the end of my driveway to pick up a dog poop bag (I run a figure 8 if my dog poops during a run I bag it and run with it, hence figure-eight allows a drop-off point as she always went poop about a 1/2 mile into our run).

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Labor is by no means perfect, the Labor Right for example has elements of it which are further right than the Liberal Party moderates for example. But, the difference is that:

- Labor is funded in part by unions, the membership of which are Australian, or people who live in Australia. Unlike the multinational corporations that provide the vast majority of the Liberal Party funding
- Labor Party representatives are not ideological nutjobs for most part. The Liberal Party has given us leaders like Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison, along with a deep bench of ideological crazies
- the Labor Party actually has a plan, and policies which are based on evidence and they have budgeted for. The Liberal Party went into the last election devoid of policy.

Objectively, and by the historical record, the Labor Party has hands down been better for Australia than the Coalition. To anyone who might disagree, just sit down and make a list of achievements in two columns. The Labor list will be longer and more significant than the Liberal list. 

You don't need to give your first vote to the Labor Party, that's the beauty of our system. However, you should most definitely put them above the Coalition on any ballot.",1580515323

"Kombucha","t5_2qx36","Well for Kombucha, Yunnan sourcing is great, their black tea is reasonably priced and delicious. Also their Yunnan Gold type teas have a very smooth almost chocolate malt taste, and is less astringent than a lot of black tea. Also if I‚Äôm using it in Kombucha I wouldn‚Äôt use some of the REALLY nice teas that I have for the first ferment. Speaking of that...

 I tend to rate things in their own separate sub categories because it‚Äôs hard to compare a good black tea to sencha, so I‚Äôll do that for you below. These are all sources of what I consider to be ‚Äúreally nice‚Äù tea.

For black tea I really like a smoother, more balanced tea, so my fave is Taiwanese style black teas (you haven‚Äôt lived until you‚Äôve tried it). I‚Äôve gotten really good stuff from Taiwan Tea Crafts (pro tip try their Yuchi Wild Mountain black, it has this awesome bread/pastry-like flavor that is hard to describe and very unique). I have also recently tried some fabulous black tea from Japan, from Thes Du Japon, it was really nuanced. 

I‚Äôm also a big fan of Taiwanese oolong usually from Floating Leaves, Tillerman teas, or Taiwan tea Crafts. All of those have really nice quality tea, pretty much the best you‚Äôre gonna find at a price that isn‚Äôt prohibitively expensive. (If you like roasted oolong, try Floating Leaves ‚Äò98 Metal Cask Dong Ding. It is one of the best teas I‚Äôve ever had, though it does have a price point to match. Worth every penny though, saved for special occasions or when you are feeling down.)

Then for Japanese green tea I buy from O-Cha (the one in Japan, there‚Äôs another one one the web but this one only sells Japanese greens). O-Cha is pretty much the cream of the crop, they pack all their tea in nitrogen flushed bags so that no oxygen can start to oxidize the leaves and the flavor really is better because of it. Try their Chiran sencha, it‚Äôs amazing. That particular tea was what got me hooked on sencha. Thes du Japon is also good.

I get my Chinese green teas from Teaspring, or my dragonwell from Tea Habitat.

My puerh I get almost exclusively from either Crimson Lotus or Bitterleaf. Both those companies have great info on where their puerh comes from. And I‚Äôve had good luck. I‚Äôm not really a puerh expert though, I tend to prefer young sheng as opposed to the aged stuff. 

Well this has turned into a novel lol. If you want to ‚Äúup your tea game‚Äù, you should join us over at teaforum.org. It‚Äôs the place where all the tea connoisseurs live. The type of people that have been drinking tea for decades and discuss things like the affect of spring water on flavor. I‚Äôm actually fairly newbie compared to a lot of people there and I‚Äôve learned a TON from hanging out there. All the tea I‚Äôve bought since getting recommendations there has been worlds better than I could find on my own. :)",1580515325

"TennisClash","t5_10tdy4","Yes, from what I can observe, matchmaking is still (mostly) based on the trophy count. Even among the 6 matches you lost (and those were opponents whose trophy count was likely above the average), the highest was at 941 when you were at 655 - which is still pretty similar.

But, man, you can't have it both ways: trying to unlock tour 6 by maximizing your trophies, and wining around about the game matching you up with opponents that are too hard for you. What were you expecting, to unlock tour 8 while getting matched only with opponents of your stats range? (That's what suggestions like ""mm should be based on stats/skills"" would imply.) The idea of ""unlocking tours"" and trophies is that to get there, you will have to reliably beat opponents of roughly that trophy count.

Edit: the reason your opponents' trophy count differs so much, is that you are playing tour 2, where you are an extreme outlier - there obviously aren't many 500+ trophy players there, so the game likely matches you with the strongest opponent it can find within reasonable queue time. Sometimes it will be someone with many less trophies than you, sometimes with more.",1580515325

"PSO2","t5_2sjei","Support in this game belongs mostly to the techer class, but most people with access to techs (force, techer, bouncer, phantom, hero, summoner) can use resta, anti, megiverse, zanverse, zondeel, or just throw some sol/star atomizers if you're feeling generous to your party. You just need to be close by to get exp, so leeching is a thing in this game, but most people below 75 won't care at that point. 

Your tech will mostly depend on your weapon's base technique, your weapon's technique affixes, your armor/unit tech affixes, your mag's tech level, and how good your customization/craft on the tech is. It is assumed that you will have the tech (like resta) at level 17 and an optimal skill tree like everyone else. Race/gender differences are there, but they are negligible at cap. It is basically mandatory that tech users get their main techs customized by another player once you're near endgame, but you can buy some custom techs off the player market.",1580515326

ARLINGTON EXISTS.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

We only rode three things before giving up. 

The third was more recently: Top Thrill Dragster. We had meant to get there right as it opened up but ran a bit late to the park, decided to give SteVe a second chance (we were decidedly unimpressed with ride #1 the day prior) and that put us about 20 minutes late to Dragster opening. I don't regret the wait- I absolutely loved Dragster (I love launches) but I don't think I'd wait 2 hours again. We only waited about 20 minutes for SteVe on day one of the trip and 40 on day 2.

"politics","t5_2cneq","A couple of things to bear in mind: this November is the first presidential election since 2016.  2016 went the way it did for the simple reason that many voters chose to stay home.  Sure trump supporters were and continue to be subjected to brainwashing by propaganda but the fact is if voter participation rates had been even 5% higher (and possible less) trump would have lost not only the popular vote but also the electoral college as well.  

Conservatives also love to forget 2018.  Despite what they‚Äôll try to tell you, the blue wave happened despite corrupt republicans gerrymandering and working to suppress votes.  Turnout was unprecedented for a mid-term election.

I consider this November to be a last chance.  If voters do their jobs, republicans will be ousted from the White House and senate and be further marginalized in the House of Representatives.  If the voters fail to achieve that, less comfortable means of revolution will be required.",1580515330

Your clones are not that impressive, you must be very ashamed.

Watch those wrist reposts

Are we blind, deploy the downvotes

Oh no the reposter

A repost to be sure and an unwelcome one

Guess I was wrong, there was no OC at all

Master, reposters

I don‚Äôt like reposts, they're rough, coarse, irritating and they get everywhere

now THiS is reposting

You'll try reposting that‚Äôs a bad trick

This is where the repost begins

We will watch your repost with no interest

I will deal with this repost slime myself

I don‚Äôt think the OC works

The ability to post does not make you original

Only a sith deals in reposts

Ironic. He could save others from reposts but not himself

It‚Äôs over OP, I have the high karma

You were supposed to destroy the reposters not join them!

What about the repost attack on the OC?

My powers have doubled since the last time I saw this post OP

You are on this subreddit, but we don‚Äôt give you the rank of OC

Fool, I have been trained in repost identification arts by Count Dooku

You are not doing this, the effort would kill you

I downvoted them all, they're dead, every single one of them. And not just the reposts, but the shit posts and the OC too. They're reposts, so I downvoted them like reposts. I hate them!

You ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagiarism the unwise, I though not, it‚Äôs not a story the mods would tell you. It‚Äôs a reddit legend. Darth plagiarism was a dark lord of reposting. So dumb and so unoriginal, he would use the sort by hot to find good posts and creat reposts. He had such low knowledge of posting he couldn‚Äôt even keep the karma he loved from dying. The dark side of reposting is the path to many disabilities some considered to be unnatural. He became so weak, the only thing he was still afraid of loosing was his reposts, witch eventually of course he didn‚Äôt. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice reposted his post. Ironic, he couldn‚Äôt keep others karma from dying, not even his own

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","A lot of couples therapists meet with each person individually as well to give them an opportunity to say things they might be uncomfortable saying in front of their SO. Then the therapists introduces it to them together in a more neutral and clear way. 

I don‚Äôt have experience with an impartial therapist so I have nothing to say on that end. It would suck feeling like you‚Äôre not being heard, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important for people to know they can therapist shop and aren‚Äôt bound to any of them. 

One of the big issues in OP‚Äôs post isn‚Äôt the lack of communication, it‚Äôs that the communication isn‚Äôt working. Which is why I think couples counseling is a good answer for that. Not someone to say ‚Äòyou‚Äôre wrong and they‚Äôre right‚Äô but instead figure out why the communication isn‚Äôt working. 

They both should do individual counseling, though. Shit, EVERYONE should have a therapist.",1580515331

The questions needs to be, if a current retiree back dated his lifetime of ss contributions and put it into free market, (given that his salary was SMALLER 20 years ago and thus their ss contribution due to the dollar being worth more, then would they be recieving more from the free market.

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","&gt; Swap out the navi for a 3 year old 30% weaker Nvidia card and AC:O runs faster, smoother, and that's after bumping up the settings even higher than I just had them.

AC:O is known to run faster with Nvidia hardware, so *part* of that is somewhat expected.

When I first picked up my 5700, I had crashing, stuttering, and overall low FPS. I found that it was resolved when I fixed my case-airflow, and RAM instability. That we are running almost the same hardware (2600X/Navi) and I am not having the issue inclines me to believe it's another factor. 

The down-clocking is not indicative that the card/driver is the problem. That stutter is occurring now that your new card is in, is *somewhat* indicative of it being a problem, but as we've both gotten at, it could well me something else. And there is a chance that whatever this something else is, won't affect a different architecture of card. So I wish you the best of luck there.


&gt; Even turned down slightly to ensure stability on 2nd gen ryzen

How far down? Are we talking 2133MHz - 2933MHz? Officially it only supports up to 2933MHz, but most people (who try) manage to get 3200MHz out of theirs. My system starts stuttering/low FPS when I clock it at 2666MHz and lower.

You don't mention any crashing issues, so the following probably isn't terribly applicable to you. But I wonder if it might provide more context. It's what I've taken to posting for people getting both performance and crashing issues with their 5700 cards.

&gt; When I switched from an 580 to a 5700, my system went from crashing 1-5 times a month (which I lived with for over a year), to crashing multiple times a day.

&gt; This increase in frequency made it much easier to track down the cause, it turned out my RAM was unstable with the default termination block settings my motherboard used for them. Once I figured out which setting it was, it became perfectly stable.

&gt; It seems as though the 5700 series is *much* more affected by unstable RAM than previous series. Consider checking if your RAM is stable.

&gt; Do you know what wattage your power supply is? Some have had issues with PSUs that could not keep up with their 5700. 600w is the minimum according to AMD, with 700w being the recommended.


Edit: 
&gt; So please spare me the uninformed bandwagon nonsense. I know the problem variable when I see it.

I have spoken with a number of people claiming that, and with help many have discovered the problem wasn't their card. I say this so you'll get where I'm coming from here.",1580515332

"politics","t5_2cneq","To be honest, it's the only argument against removal that is even worth debating ... because it's inherently honest, rather than the absolutely absurdist rhetoric spewed by the President's council. It is an argument that is not a defense of illegal action, but rather acknowledging that illegal actions occurred. That's an important point.

We have Lamar Alexander and Rubio both (and I've heard talk of as many as 5 Republican Senators) saying that the burden of proof for impeachable conduct was met, but we don't believe that removal is the best option for the country. They are basically admitting that the arguments made by the President's council were garbage compared to the mountain of evidence presented by the House. That's important.

The argument that ""proven impeachable conduct doesn't automatically end with removal from office based on the overall benefit to the nation"" is at least one that can be had ... acknowledging wrongdoing occurred rather than purely covering it up or trying to, in a display of near insanity, bend the law and constitution into pretzels to say things no one with a shred of common sense would accept.",1580515332

At this rate we'll have 4 other Em albums that go ""in the right direction"" and then we'll have an album that we can call great.

Em needs to stop trying to appeal to teenagers and pop audiences and actually try to do an album with a great concept. He needs to go out of his comfort zone and at least challenge himself with something other than doing fast flows and cramming syllables. Maybe working with other producers and not touching a beat would help him focus more on the writing quality. There are other amazing producers who can work with him and give him production that fits him. He doesn't need to produce 15 average beats by himself or with Luis Resto.

Like at this point I'm just not excited for ANY music from Em unless it's Bad Meets Evil. The last time I was excited to hear an album from Em was the MMLP2 and that's because of the name only tbh.

I just want this man to release one last amazing album and retire gracefully.",1580515333

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Honestly, nobody here can tell you if you're depressed because we're (mostly) not mental health professionals and (more importantly) nobody here is *your* doctor.

That being said, aside from losing interest in social media, have you lost interest in other things that you used to enjoy doing? Like if you used to go hiking, playing video games, making crafts, etc, do you not enjoy doing that anymore? Those types of things are more indicative of depression than the realization that social media is kind of attention whoring at it's worst. 

Also an indication of depression is significant weight loss or gain *without trying* but that also can be related to stresses. Appetite changes normally anyway, but significant would be like 20lbs +/- in a month.

The other person recommended a therapist, which is a good idea for some people. You can bounce ideas off of a professional and whether you're depressed or not it can help to just have someone else's input. Therapy isn't for everyone, and it's ok if you get a therapist and it doesn't work out for you. Sometimes you don't mesh with that therapist and need to try someone else. Sometimes therapy doesn't help at all.

I wish you the best of luck.",1580515334

"ChildrenFallingOver","t5_2yo2z","I grew up skateboarding, rollerblading, and riding bmx at skateparks. I don't think the skateboarder was in the wrong. I learned quickly the way the skateparks flow because of these type of incidents.

First off if you bring your child to a skatepark you should understand the risks that you are putting your child into and the risks you are putting on the riders. I've seen some far worst incidents happen because of parents negligence. The worst is to see them take it out on others by blaming them. It is a nice idea to bring your children to skatepark, but be away that there are potential risks.

Kid on the scooter... he should have some decent shoes. I grew up where I didnt have the luxury to have name brand. But soles with some grip that cover your toes, and they dont slip off easily can be a matter of limping home because you got hurt or riding home because it was a good session. I remember and incident that I had. I didnt have money to replace my shoes with a hole in the right sole. So, I duct tape them. I'm skate boarding with my duct taped shoes. Im going down a ramp. Then up and over a fun box. As I'm landing my right foot slips off the board (I'm regular. Not goofy). I end up eating it. Busted knee and rolled ankle... it could of been prevented if I just had a decent pair of shoes. You dont need name brand.... and a freaking helmet! It's insane the long term trauma you can obtain from a head injury especially from a young age.

How the skateboarder reacted wasn't bad. He obviously was frustrated, but he's a human who rides a piece of wood attached to four wheels... we cant even hold the president of the US to a higher standard. Sorry for bringing US politics into this. It's just a wild state of affairs we're in these days. But my point being is that the guy did show a little frustration but he didn't  leave. He got out of the way and came right back. We use to always joke around, ""never touch a bear's cubs."" This was because an incident very similar happened where kid cuts someone off kid gets hurt guy tries to help kid and then parent went off. I think he did the right thing here. Got out of the way, came back and didnt leave, noticed that mama bear was coming. Let her asses the situation.  And this is where it cuts off but I would say he just needs to talk to her. Things get taken to unnecessary levels and it's usually because of lack of communication. The guys I would roll with we would always speak with parents who brought young kids. Create that level of communication with them so that they learn also. People rarely understand the level of communication that happens within a skatepark because it's not always verbal.

To the parents please try to understand that a skatepark is not the same as a playground. Talk with the locals. I'm sure there will be a few bad seeds but dont let that spoil the bunch for you. For a lot of kids, the skatepark is their only outlet and might be their only escape from their harsh realities. That's what it was for me.  There are risks at skateparks and to fully understand them you may need to speak with the locals. Sometimes the best thing to do is take a moment to just watch and see how the traffic moves.

To the skatepark locals... this is the next generation. Take the time to reach out to parents. From what I've experienced they have no clue and dont even realize the dangers. Some see it the same as a playground and think that you guys dont like to share or their kids age is a burden. When we know that can be far from the truth.

Sorry for the long rant. Just seeing everyone point fingers at who is to blame. It's not one particular person's fault. It's just communication and understanding that needs to be had. I hope it happens and you lace that next trick.",1580515336

To me this beverage is completely soothing and delicious.

If I feel I need extra energy, I add some MCT oil (which doesn‚Äôt cause me digestive distress, though I‚Äôve heard it does for some people).

My method:  I open up the can of coconut milk, (carefully) put the contents into a quart-size mason jar, fill the jar up the rest of the way with hot water or hot green tea, put the lid on and shake. I drink half today, save the other half for tomorrow (reheat in microwave right in the jar for ~2 min). Voila!",1580515339

Afterwards though, you still have all the DLC weapons to grind as they come out, and you can begin enjoying yourself again with classes that are fun instead of trying to run a VLK 3.0x Dragunov on Shipment for double kills.

It‚Äôs not always the best, sometimes it‚Äôs 5 minutes, sometimes 5 hours but you won‚Äôt be waiting outside in some sketchy situation. And if your steady, I‚Äôll front, honestly I even encouraged it. Like with k2, don‚Äôt buy my oz for 80, buy the qp for 150, keep two for yourself and make your money on the other 2. Now you got 150, just take the pound for 450 that you‚Äôre going to spend anyways. 

That‚Äôs what fucking sucks though. I‚Äôd heard some of my people, why they were even talking like that with me around, idk, but that they need to keep junkies in their place. 

Oh yeah, I means there‚Äôs definitely situations where you got to make your ends meet. All you can do is give your guy a shot, but it isn‚Äôt worth losing out over waiting around on no responses or the likes. 

And that‚Äôs pretty awesome. That‚Äôs a nice little sustainable hustle. Make good without being hot as fuck. That‚Äôs kind of like what I did, but once I got that good good, I was paying 300 a ball, no breaks till a half. Prior my people were paying 200-250 a ball at the most, but I ended up getting them to pay 150 a gram. Everyone thought I lost my mind till they tried that shit, the first day I thought it may be too high and I‚Äôd just have to keep that coke for myself, but I started getting calls in the middle of the night. 

At that time though I was making bank of k2 though, only having around 3 grand into 50 pounds after it was all sprayed. I was trading what I had maybe 10 cents into for 20-30 bags of dope before I actually got on it. Someone thinks they‚Äôre making nice even on a big trade like on a qp or half pound, yet I was getting balls of crack for what I had like 10 bucks into, but than again these people were selling the spice for 10 a gram compared to my 80 an oz type prices.

I play solo, I have 2k badges on two characters, highest kills is 11, but I can go two weeks without a win eeeeeasy. Never got a win on an LTM this last event. Some nights I get slapped every round.

But the game is exceptional, playing non-multiplayer fps is just so boring now (finding it hard to finish Borderlands 3), and I've improved a lot since the start.  Crazy game, the highs and the lows, never played something so much since Planetside 2. I've actually put work into improving my aim, but being 40 has it's downsides when it comes to sheer speed of movement and tracking accuracy. I can afford a beast PC now but you can't buy good aim :D.

"lostgeneration","t5_2r40j","I‚Äôm a millennial, 35 in 7 weeks.

I am poorer today than when I was 21 and in school full time while working retail on the side.

My net worth is negative as I went bankrupt in 2017 and haven‚Äôt been able to gather the $3000 needed to discharge it. Not that it matters as I wouldn‚Äôt have ever been able to sign a mortgage without an R9 on my credit.

Here is what I have observed: the only millennials (not speaking of X as I am referencing the peers I grew up with) having kids are the very richest ones. With parents at the top of the banking and automotive industries. The very two industries bailed out by the people...

I‚Äôve wanted kids since I was one myself. I would have raised them in a social democratic belief system. 

They would have been my contribution to humanity - kids that understand how 20th C. capitalism brought the earth and humanity to the brink, and who are equipped with the critical knowledge to work towards equity for all.

I expect to live no longer than 70, after a lifetime of untreated disability and soul and body destroying work. Recently I‚Äôve been looking for books, fiction or not, that focus on the lives of scullery maids and other lower classes throughout history, because almost nothing in modern culture relates to my life. Movies and shows about suburban teenage angst in Beverley Hills... are there actually enough people whose lives this shit reflects to make it profitable? Or is it the byproduct of only the most mediocre people having access to the resources to make culture?

Probably both.

I look ahead to a future run by the richest, whitest kids of the richest, whitest folks who are the only ones with sufficient resources to raise kids today, and I know North American society will get a lot more stratified before it becomes equitable... if ever.",1580515343

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Your ""personal lenses"" are apparently quite distorted. This impeachment has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton (why you're bring her up is anyone's guess) or the 2016 election. The only people who keep harping on her and that election are Trump and his supporters who can't seem to move past that despite the fact they won it almost four years ago (sore winners much?).

This impeachment is solely about the fact Trump abused his power, got caught, and then obstructed justice to try to remain in office. The evidence already discovered by the House is more than enough to establish Trump's guilt for the two charges for which he was impeached. That evidence included firsthand recollection testimony from two non-partisan witnesses so I have no idea why you're claiming it was all biased hearsay, that's simply untrue. Further, what the Ukrainian President knew and did regarding Trump's abuse of power has absolutely zero bearing on Trump's culpability. Trump knew he was abusing his power by intentionally withholding aid until the Ukrainian President would officially announce an investigation into Hunter Biden (an arrangement explicitly described and corroborated by several insiders who will now not get to testify before the Senate because Republican Senators have voted not to allow those witnesses to testify). Trump's knowledge and intention are the only things that matter for determining his guilt, not what some other President of some other country knew, and there's plenty of witnesses and evidence to establish his knowledge and intention if only the Senate Republicans would bother moving past their partisan shortsightedness on at least this one issue.",1580515344

If you aren't going to be on HNIC then you are more than likely going to be at the mercy of the weird matinee scheduling the US teams love so much.

This will work fine. The chromel-to-screw connection will create a thermal EMF, and the screw-to-chromel connection will create the opposite-polarity thermal EMF. If the two screws are at exactly the same temperature (which they should be because the piece of metal is so short), the two thermal EMFs have equal magnitudes, so they cancel.",1580515344

Maria Bartiromo: 

&gt;""This morning though, there's this new worry, the coronavirus...You could seriously see the Chinese economy come to a halt.  Given the large percentage of global growth that China commands, does that actually threaten what you're just saying?""

Ross: 
&gt;""Well, first of all, every American's heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus, so I don't want to take a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease.  But the fact is, it does give businesses another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain, on top of all the other things.  Because you have SARS, you have the African swine [fever] there, now you have this. It's another risk factor that people need to take into account.  So I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America, some to US, probably some to Mexico as well.

Maria Bartiromo: 
&gt;""Ah, that's a good point, actually yeah, because these companies are going to have to do something, after they shut things down in China, is what you're saying.""

Ross: 
&gt;""Absolutely, and you've already heard Apple talking about figuring out how to replace some of the Chinese production, you had others also doing the same thing, so I think there's a confluence of factors that will make it...""

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

I know a lot of growers that don't mind, or even intentionally, grow moss on the surface. While it's not harmful to the plant, they also absorb nutrients, most of the time the same ones a growing plant is looking for. So I would consider changing mediums or leaving the cover off for some air circulation. But again I have never used that system so I could be completely wrong also lol",1580515346

I'm designing a frame bag that will hold a water bladder. Having never owned a frame bag before, idk the best way to hold the bladder. I was thinking about hanging it from a reinforced loop where the seat tube and top tube meet but then it may sway a lot? 

Another idea is creating a ""hammock"" pocket from the top above the zipper but then it may be difficult to get it in and out? 

My last idea would be to just let it flop to the bottom of the bag. 

FYI the front of the bag will be cut off as shown in the picture because I have downtube shifters. 

Any ideas? Thanks!!!",1580515346

You don't. No one who understands the system would claim Ambulances are private.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt;You can not have an economy without basic inputs as resources. And so long as the economy grows exponentially those basic inputs will be extracted exponentially.

This has not been the historic case. 

&gt; You could manipulate price signals to reduce consumption of basic  inputs, at that point you are placing your own artificial limits to  growth. 

Exactly. It serves as a double incentive, it reduces consumption as scarcity increases while also incentive people to find alternatives/less consumptive methods. 

&gt; What does that mean exactly? Could you show me the source ? 

The most easily accessible source is probably going to be starting with [More From Less](https://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Surprising-Learned-Resources_and/dp/1982103574). You can go down the rabbit hole from there. 

&gt; Thing is advanced complex technologies tend to require rarer resource  inputs, if civilization depends on these technologies for growth then  the limits become those rare inputs. 

Regenerative Ag is not, at least not for the most part. Nuclear is but we are not currently facing any resource crises I know of that would keep it from becoming wide spread. Yes, as per your follow up quote it is not without downsides and difficulties but many of these can be overcome. Some solutions exist now (Thorium) some do not but are realistic (sea water extraction). 

If it's too late, then it is too late. But in terms of solutions those exist. 

&gt; Explain. You want to impose limits on the consumption of rare inputs or  are you assuming we would always find new rare inputs in time to replace  depleted rare inputs even as demand for them grows exponentially? 

Either &amp; both. Double incentive as mentioned above. 

&gt; Which would require a lot of rocket launches.  You will get growth  pressures like Kepler Syndrom and possible ozone damage, not to mention  the rocket fuel needed. If rockets get more efficient they will get used  more, creating a rebound effect (Jevons Paradox) which increases the  total amount of fuel being used. 

Again, solvable. From space elevators to planetary colonization to potential non-liquid fuel sources. While I know it is fiction, it is decently well researched fiction (and a fun read) Delta-V is an interesting look at near future possibilities. 

&gt; When would energy get cheaper than it has already been in the past century? 

Fusion is the most obvious candidate. Should we ever solve that we may actually see a future of too cheap to meter type energy. Breakthroughs in solar power could also give us this. While some experts point to 2035 (going off memory here) as the inflection point for solar getting cheaper than conventional a notable breakthrough in the ability for solar to capture energy could lead to a massive and rapid decline in cost measured in resources needed per gigawatt captured. 

Barring climate change armageddon we are a long ways off from exhausting growth potential (assuming we make no really stupid mistakes along the way).",1580515347

This also means they have lots of Artists and Designers sitting around, because none of the stuff they were working on (that needs new code) can be progressed.

Hence Prisons - apparently, it's entirely existing functionality that they've re-used, plus new art assets.  Thus, CIG get to build a new gameplay loop, give us some new functionality, keep their teams busy, and implement something that was on the backlog (so it's not 'scope creep' etc).

About the only people that don't seem to be happy about it are those that don't pay attention to what CIG have said, and are complaining that it's not the functionality they personally were interested in.",1580515348

\- Tired of the hackers on PC

\- Tired of the terrible load times, even with an M.2

\- Tired of Managing hard drive space, unisntalling and re-installing, updating. 

\- There are 4 PC Gamers in my house, that is 4 Gaming rigs to buy every 2-3 years. Gets expensive. 

\- Buying the Gaming rigs consists of an incredible amount of research and build time. I don't have that time anymore. 

\- So far the input lag has been barely noticeable on my wireless laptop, but not at all on my hardwired Rig. 

\- The PC Building tradition will continue in my house, but the build will only need to cost about $350 rather than $1500-2000.  We will put some of the saved money toward good monitors, keyboards and mice.",1580515350

"lordsmobile","t5_3cvj4","I fight in forts every kvk and in DA.  I've bounced lots of solo troop rally blasts from dudes with more might than me and in mythic gear and slinging the same number of troops as me.

Starters...familiars.  You need 3 slots,and IMO, you need the 3 hp debuff fams, jaziek, terraspike and magmalord.  These guys debuff HP by 40%, and they provide as much of a boost if not more than gremlin/goblin/trickstar during the tests I've done.  You need 4 quick swaps.  You need to swap to cav/inf/ran or mix.  Mix is so you don't have your pants caught down by a dick who carpets your fort.

Start of defense, you need to know what he's sending.  If cav, swap to range pha and swap to range gear. If they beat you with this and you see they have roughly same gear level as you, fiddle with your heroes and comp.  Had a guy that kept knocking me out with range.  Well, inf is my weakest, so I modified my mix battalion for 2 inf heroes.  Sat in 4/3/3 troop comp, and bounced the guys next rally.  If they spam you with troops, wait for the last second of his rally, and port to another spot.  That should clear up your watchtower.  If they spam the base, you gotta put on your quick eyes to spot his coalition in all that mess.  You might be able to spot his gear, but if he's remotely crafty, this won't help you.  You could drop a scout when he marches, but again, crafty leads won't pop an attack boost until the last second.

I've never had good luck bouncing anything in my mix set.  You just do so much more damage with your specific attack set over mix.",1580515350

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He ' s got esprit up to here. Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night. His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air. A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren
hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest, Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.

When they gave him the job, they gave him a gun. The Deliverator never deals in cash, but someone might come after him anyway -- might want his car, or his cargo. The gun is tiny, acm-styled, lightweight, the kind of gun a fashion designer would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at five times the velocity of an SR-71 spy plane, and when you get done using it, you have to plug it into the cigarette lighter, because it runs on electricity.

The Deliverator never pulled that gun in anger, or in fear. He pulled it once in Gila Highlands. Some punks in Gila Highlands, a fancy Burbclave, wanted themselves a delivery, and they didn't want to pay for it. Thought they would impress the Deliverator with a baseball bat. The Deliverator took out his gun, centered its laser doohickey on that poised Louisville Slugger, fired it. The
recoil was immense, as though the weapon had blown up in his hand. The middle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of burning sawdust accelerating in all directions like a bursting star. Punk ended up holding this bat handle with milky smoke pouring out the end. Stupid look on his face. Didn't get nothing but trouble from the Deliverator.

Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment and relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren't afraid of the gun, so the
Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords need no demonstrations .



The Deliverator ' s car has enough poten≈£ial energy packed into its batteries to fire a pound of bacon into the Asteroid Belt. Unlike a bimbo box or a Burb beater, the Deliverator ' s car unloads that power through gaping, gleaming, polished sphincters. When the Deliverator puts the hammer down, shit happens .
You want to talk contact patches? Your car's tires have tiny contact patches, talk to the asphalt in four places the size of your tongue. The Deliverator ' s car has big sticky tires with contact patches the size of a fat lady's thighs. The Deliverator is in touch with the road, starts like a bad day, stops on a
peseta .



Why is the Deliverator so equipped? Because people rely on him. He is a roll model. This is America. People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you got a problem with that? Because they have a right to. And because they have guns and no one can fucking stop them. As a result, this country has one of the worst economies in the world. When it gets down to it -- talking trade balances here -- once we've brain-drained all our technology into other countries, once things have evened out, they 're making cars in Bolivia and microwave ovens in Tadzhikistan and selling them here -- once our edge in natural resources has been made irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North Dakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickel -- once the Invisible Hand has taken all those historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global layer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity -- y'know what? There's only four things we do better than anyone else

music
movies
microcode (software)
high-speed pizza delivery

The Deliverator used to make software. Still does, sometimes. But if life were a mellow elementary school run by well-meaning education Ph.D.s, the Deliverator ' s report card would say: ""Hiro is so bright and creative but needs to work harder on his cooperation skills.""

So now he has this other j ob . No brightness or creativity involved -- but no cooperation either. Just a single principie: The Deliverator stands tall, your pie in thirty minutes or you can have it free, shoot the driver, take his car, file a class-action suit. The Deliverator has been working this job for six months, a rich and lengthy tenure by his standards, and has never delivered a pizza in raore than twenty-one minutes.

Oh, they used to argue over times, many corporate driver-years lost to it: homeowners, red-faced and sweaty with their own lies, stinking of Old Spice and job-related stress, standing in their glowing yellow doorways brandishing their Seikos and waving at the clock over the kitchen sink, I swear, can't you guys
tell time?

Didn't happen anymore. Pizza delivery a major industry. A managed industry. People went to CosaNostra Pizza University four years just to learn it. Came in its doors unable to write an English sentence, from Abkhazia, Rwanda, Guanajuato, South Jersey, and came out knowing more about pizza than a Bedouin
knows about sand. And they had studied this problem. Graphed the frequency of doorway delivery-time disputes. Wired the early Deliverators to record, then analyze, the debating tactics, the voice-stress histograms, the distinctive grammatical structures employed by white middle-class Type A Burbclave occupants
who against all logic had decided that this was the place to take their personal Custerian stand against all that was stale and deadening in their lives: they were going to lie, or delude themselves, about the time of their phone call and get themselves a free pizza; no, they deserved a free pizza along with their
life, liberty, and pursuit of whatever, it was fucking inalienable. Sent psychologists out to these people 's houses, gave them a free TV set to submit to an anonymous interview, hooked them to polygraphs, studied their brain waves as they showed them choppy, inexplicable movies of porn queens and late-night car
crashes and Sammy Davis, Jr., put them in sweet-smelling, mauve-walled rooms and asked them questions about Ethics so perplexing that even a Jesuit couldn't respond without committing a venial sin.

The analysts at CosaNostra Pizza University concluded that it was just human nature and you couldn't fix it, and so they went for a quick cheap technical fix: smart boxes. The pizza box is a plastic carapace now, corrugated for stiffness, a little LED readout glowing on the side, telling the Deliverator how many trade imbalance-producing minutes have ticked away since the fateful phone
call. There are chips and stuff in there. The pizzas rest, a short stack of them, in slots behind the Deliverator ' s head. Each pizza glides into a slot like a circuit board into a computer, clicks into place as the smart box interfaces with the onboard system of the Deliverator ' s car. The address of the caller has already been inferred from his phone number and poured into the smart
box's built-in RAM. From there it is communicated to the car, which computes and projects the optimal route on a heads-up display, a glowing colored map traced out against the windshield so that the Deliverator does not even have to glance down.",1580515351

"OWConsole","t5_3f3wt","it's super easy to carry with tank even with poor healers or dps. I would watch your game play back and look at things like your positioning and cooldown management (ask questions like, did I waste my bubble/shield/vape/whatever when I could've just used cover? did my positioning allow me to get farmed and killed?) . these things are simple but important to improve.

I play around 3700 on Xbox. controllers are, yes, less reactive and more clunky than mnk, but they aren't holding you back. probably play around with your sensitivity and raise it some. I raised my sens to around 80/85 for heroes that aren't aim intensive. it's usually more important to be able to turn around quickly rather than have precise aim, especially as tank. I would put it lower for someone like zarya who requires more tracking, but preferably keep it higher rather than lower. this is also simple, but a big change that can help you react faster which is imperative to survival.

the biggest thing that will help you is to focus on your own gameplay. it does absolutely nothing to sit there and say ""I can't win, my healer sucks"". instead, just play your smartest, play your best, and adapt your playstyle depending on if your team backs you up or not. if your healers aren't the best, stop trying to be overly aggressive and play around them. if you see opportunities, take them. these are judgment calls and can make or break a game, and you will lose plenty, but it's important to always be learning, studying your gameplay, and improving. you will find yourself winning if you focus on yourself, and you will climb. a lot of times, if you die, it was your fault and something was punished, whether it be your cooldown usage, your positioning, or a mix of both. everytime you die think: what could I have done that might have prevented me from dying there? 

edit: wanted to add, voice chat is basically useless in lower ranks. most people don't make correct call outs nor do they follow up on others' call outs. it's better to focus on improving your own gamesense and positioning. things like ult and cooldown tracking will come with time. when I played in gold/Plat I usually just stayed out of teamchat and trusted my own gamesense. this is the best way to improve it, imo. if you really want to make callouts and if people are listening, make simple call outs like enemy positioning but don't expect much from your teammates.",1580515351

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Her skin texture looks a lot like fungal acne which makes perfect sense. Fungal acne thrives in humid environments like someone's skin when they go to a place like Bali. Then she was trying to treat it with chemical exfoliants that probably had ingredients that feed fungal acne. Pure aloe doesn't feed fungal acne so once she got rid of those chemical exfoliants and probably left Bali she kept her skin moisturized using only the aloe the fungal acne didn't have anything to feed on and went away.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","Historical anarchist critiques of *existing* civilization should not be conflated with modern-day anarcho-primitivist ideology. Perhaps the second quote bolsters your case to some degree, but the first and third examples remain subject to differing interpretations. 

&gt;
Point is, you don't have to accept these critiques, they are heavily debated and discussed and there are many anarchists like Kropotkin et al who disagree. But going around saying stuff like ""if you hate civilization then you hate disabled and trans people and you love genocide"" isn't really how you respond to anti-civ critiques from anarchists.

As I've said before, it is totally pointless to argue about whether anarcho-primitivists harbor animus towards specific marginalized populations. Consequences matter more than intentions - if industrial processes and modern medicine were abolished wholesale, then genocide would be an inevitable consequence.",1580515351

Best thing is - if possible in your archetype - to have your draw, ramp and answers be on-theme too. Not only is it pretty effective and can make some decks work well even without their commander out, but it's also more fun to forgo usual commander staple cards and find on-theme alternatives that work just as well. For example in a sacrifice-heavy deck (like Korvold), it's easy to have draw, ramp, removal, recursion all linked to saccing stuff and it feels so satisfying to discover all the small synergies and benefits that might not have been obious at first glance.",1580515351

"HomeServer","t5_2sxqm","&gt; Well, for one I don't see how I could hook up my mirrored WD reds on this SBC

You can connect SATA drives to it. The NAS case and eSATA adapter are in the Pine64 store.

&gt;Concerning my Python scripts, I require an up to date version of the conda environment and associated libraries.

Not familiar with it. Some quick googling tells me you can build it for ARM.

&gt; This seems to idle at around 10-20W measured at the socket according to redditors with similar systems.

The Rockpro64 idles at like 4.5W and maxes at like 8.5W under full CPU load... we aren't talking a few watts, we are talking a few multiples. Again, you emphasized power consumption and needs well low enough for it to handle without a problem. That build is about 5x faster than a Rockpro64, so it's not a bad option unless you really wanted power savings. Basically it will use about ~3x more power, but it is 5x faster. If the power difference doesn't matter then it is better because faster... just remember though, that the needs you outlined wouldn't even be taxing on the Rockpro64 so it's seemingly wasted electricity. 


&gt;SBCs are perfectly fine for a dedicated, non-critical task.

The Rockpro64 was engineered specifically with a NAS in mind... your experience with other SBC's doesn't apply here.",1580515351

"Eragon","t5_2qyfi","It's all right! And I wanna clarify that I wasn't trying to diss on Eragon I know some people criticize it by saying Paolini took too many ideas from WoT and Star Wars and LoTR but personally I don't find that as a bad thing, everyone takes inspiration from somewhere even Jordan from Tolkien and Tolkien from norse myhology, and Paolini evolved those ideas into his own thing. Without Eragon back in high school I might've never given older fantasy a try.

Yeah Jordan's passing before finishing his series must've been really hard on people at the time, but I'm glad they chose Brandon Sanderson to finish since he did an amazing job and I don't know if I would've read WoT if it wasn't for that. Long story short Brandon became my favorite author a few years back and I read EVERYTHING from him even reading another series just to read those last books from him.

I'll give you a recommendation, WoT is probably not the best fantasy series to get back into reading since it's such a commitment (14 books) so if you want to dip your toes back into fantasy try Mistborn or Elantris first and then once you feel comfortable reading longer series give WoT a try!",1580515352

Well, the MSM attack in packs that follow a logic of their own, and if they decided to pick at something about Warren one month it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with Warren. 

But what was actually happening around then, is Bernie would say (in a self-assured, matter-of-fact tone) that yeah your taxes could go up but your overall costs would come down.   When they asked Warren about that she would act hesitant, and try to do anything she could to avoid what might get turned into an ""I will raise your taxes"" sound bite.   

In all honesty, the critical difference here is Bernie *sounds* like he's being up front, and Warren, on that particularly point, *sounded* like she was dodging.   Talking to the American people is like talking to dogs: you can say anything, it's your tone of voice that's important.",1580515352

"TheRightCantMeme","t5_3p1as","The Confederate States of America were literal rebels against the US.

These are the same people who generally lean to the right politically and therefore tend to agree with the meme posted by OP.

"tolkienfans","t5_2r6jm","&gt;I‚Äôve never heard of people criticising something for having ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù morality

It's a way of calling it 'childish' in not so many words, like when children play 'Cops and Robbers' or 'Cowboys and Indians', where one side is clearly bad and wears black hats, and the other is clearly good and wears white. Examples tend to focus on the depictions of the black riders, orcs and other foes as ugly and unsympathetic. That's generally a connotation of 'black and white'. 

Another is that it's 'immature', childishly blind to 'moral' shades of grey. Examples of this might includes complaints about there being no sex (explicit or otherwise), little in terms of gratuitous violence, and little mention of politics, religion or society. Why aren't there more women, races and sexual orientations is very recent gripe. I suppose the idea is that unless the story isn't solving the issues of elvish abortion and dwarven homosexual representation properly it's not 'good literature'.

[Here](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/11/in-middle-earth-must-all-hobbits-be-white/343239/) are [a few](https://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jan/08lord.htm) [examples](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/12/05/the-dragons-egg). Though there are many, *many* more. ['Epic Pooh' by Moorcock](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/en361fantastika/bibliography/2.7moorcock_m.1978epic_pooh.pdf) is [rather infamous](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/anti-tolkien), though IMO, it was mostly a publicity stunt. It's flattering for an author to imagine themselves jousting against John as a writer, though very few approach his stature. The rest are comparative Don Quixotes or children on ponies (like Rowling, Rothfuss, Sanderson, some Jordan and so on) tilting against Johns battle hardened knight. I even like one or two of Moorcocks stories, but he's awfully self indulgent, pretentious, jealous and not half as good a writer, more annoyed at Johns works influence and success than concerned with his own. Peculiarly much of his work (e.g. Elric) seems very 'seventies' and dated, while Johns is timeless.",1580515353

"polymerclay","t5_2s48h","I've gotten my acrylic sheet work surfaces from the scrap bin at Tap Plastics.  But clayers without ""plastics"" stores where things like replacement light panels can be ordered/made, might use the (usually thinner) acrylic sheets inside picture frames, or plastic sheets from Home Depot (employees can cut them down to smaller sizes if needed), or just wherever they can find them.  

Ceramic tiles can be purchased at most any store like Home Depot, Lowes, and some other hardware stores, or at tile stores.    
*Ceramic* tiles used as baking surfaces, however, will leave shiny spots anywhere they were in contact with hot or curing polymer clay (because any very-smooth baking surface can do that) and they may also heat up higher than the temp in an oven's cavity (which can create darkening/scorching where they touch the clay).  And ceramic tiles will also stick to raw clay more easily before baking. 

Blades like X-Acto blades and others that are held with one hand, or have handles for use with one hand, won't work well for many polymer clay tasks, and they're rigid and thicker than blades used for those tasks.  So they might work okay for some things, but not at all well for others. There's more info on both kinds of blades on the Cutters &amp; Blades page at my site linked to above, if interested.",1580515354

You just listed the Arabic versions of Biblical names found in the Quran, a completely separate work. 

There is no agenda to make Jesus or any other Biblical characters white... their names morphed as they passed through the phonologies of different languages into which the Bible was translated over time. E.g., the J in Jesus underwent a completely regular sound change like nearly every other J in English, from Latin Iesus, from Ancient Greek Iesous,  from Biblical Hebrew Yeshua, itself a contraction of Yehoshua, whence the name Joshua.

"morbidquestions","t5_37wph","I'm a camp counselor. Knowing how stringent safety regulations are (at my camp, anyway), we would most likely get shut down for the week (which is typically the length of time most campers spend here). EDIT: I originally said that I doubted we would cease operations for the entire summer, but in the process of writing this, I realized that, yeah, we probably would.

Like, if a camper were to die violently in a public place, then that would be a whole thing. We would absolutely, 100% get shut down for the week, and I would say there is a 95% chance we would get shut down for the remainder of the summer while various agencies probe the hell out of us to see if we can be held responsible for what happened in court, and if we can continue operations. This is just the system working as it should. If a camper died of some medical condition, preventable or otherwise, we would also end up tits-deep in legal hot water and get investigated.

But in the short term (as in the sequence of events that would happen in the minutes and hours after we realize a camper has passed away), things would look something like this. First, someone's gotta call 911 to see if we can resuscitate. Then, we would have to contact our leadership team via walkie, but it would probably involve asking them to check their phone or otherwise find another way of communicating, because we have to be very careful about what we say on walkie. You have to assume everyone can hear it, even if you're not on the main channel.

After the message has been spread around in such a way that campers can't hear, 100% of our efforts are going to be focused on continuing with our day in such a way that campers won't know what's going on. This might involve rearranging programming activities at the last minute so as to keep campers away from the scene in progress, or just having everyone stay where they are until things have resolved. This is basically a high-stakes game of play pretend. As counselors, it's our job to come up with an excuse, because if campers find out, there is going to be immediate hysteria.  You would be shocked at how good counselors are at lying to their campers. Why are we staying in the woods for an extra hour? We're looking for fairies. Why are we staying in our cabins with the blinds closed? Our camp director is super hungry, and if she finds us, she's gonna eat us. Logic goes out the window with tiny children. You can be either slightly more honest or significantly more creative with older campers (our camp serves ages 6-18, so there's a big, big range), but you still do not want them to see any of what's going on, if you can help it.

TL;DR: A long game of ""prevent the campers from finding out about the medical emergency by any means necessary,"" followed by months and months of legal turmoil.",1580515357

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I've run a campaign of Dragon Age, which Fantasy Age &amp; Modern Age are based on.

It's a pleasant, fast system, easy to make characters in, with a lot of combat options. But it's very combat-oriented. Level scaling has some problems, at higher levels fights tend to last forever, because damage doesn't keep up with HP and defense skill growth.

Dragon Age's monsters and magic are limited to what was in the first videogame, though adapted heavily to the tabletop. My players rapidly discovered that there was no reason for Mages and non-Humans to obey the Chantry's restrictions (low-powered Human Warriors as described stood no chance) and went murderhobo on it, which wasn't really in spirit of the campaign but they had fun.

Fantasy Age + Companion has much more magic and monsters, and Companion makes the game more useful out of combat. I haven't read the full version of Modern Age, just the quickstart and the Expanse preview, but it seems more flexible. There's also a Midgard Bestiary and adaptations of Green Ronin's Freeport series.

If you want to see it in action, the Wil Wheaton-hosted Titansgrave Youtube series is fun. The module as published is just that very railroaded adventure, not enough of a sourcebook to really run the setting without a lot of work, and the sourcebook is tied up in a legal dispute with the video producers.",1580515357

"BoJackHorseman","t5_2zzfr","Firefly Ep 1 with commentary has Joss Whedon talk about how it would go to adverts if the screen went to black for too long, so he had the screen instead go to the darkest colour possible instead so the audience had a few silent moments to reflect on what you‚Äôve just seen before the barrage of advert noise.

So yeah always been of the view that what the creator puts out is a very specific vision, timing and pauses is everything and if they want me to pause for 20-30 seconds then I I‚Äôll get a better experience for doing so.

That said I‚Äôm bad at not skipping the end credits because it‚Äôs a default setting, I wish the default was the same as the opening credits. Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to simply reflect on what you saw.",1580515357
"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","I wouldn't worry too much about Bloomberg. If anything, Bloomberg doing well probably helps Bernie by taking votes from Biden.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","Hey,

In the future, do you think other countries like Germany or France will leave the EU and we create another union, then more countries will leave the EU to join this new union, alongside countries that aren't in Europe?

In this scenario, I could see a war in Europe if / when the power shifts over to this new union, or will a war be unlikely and the EU fades into history?

Based on this scenario, it changes the meaning of being a remainer or leaver. If the EU goes downhill from here, why would you want to remain on a sinking ship?

As a remainer, I'd feel more comfortable voting leave if it meant other countries left at the same time and created a new union.

A union is a good thing.

Thoughts?",1580515357

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

I wouldn't try enhancing to high lvls at that gear lvl yet however. Just keep following the mainquest and you' get better gear.

Armor stones can be used to enhance armor to +15 (one lvl at a time). Weapon stones do the same for weapons. Hard shards can be heated with armor stones to make concentrated armor stones which enhance armor from +15 to PEN. Combine sharps with weapon stones for concentrated weaponstones (weapons from +15 to PEN). flawless blackstones are for force enhancing (e.g. guaranteed enhancement between +13-+15). Enhancing is rng, although for weaps/armor the first +7 lvls are usually guaranteed. it'll say the % chance of succeeding in the enhance menu.",1580515362

"fednews","t5_2xy8z","It may be a factor in promotions, but it's not the main factor. I started as a GS 6 with over 10 years experience in my career field. I just got my 13 in November. I'm a vet and when I was hired I was finishing my bachelor's. I completed my bachelor's shortly after promotion to 12. And I completed my masters 3 years after that. I was a 12 for 6 years before being promoted and my degrees were directly related. So I actually learned things I could apply on the job.

But I can tell you my field knowledge, work ethic, and interpersonal skills probably had a far greater role in my promotions. That being said, managers often receive many, many applicants and their documents are often rated and ranked to decide who receives interviews. Exp in the field is obviously valued more, but having the right degree could help boost you to the top. I've been a manager for several years as well so this is personal experience.

Finally, some of the best employees I have worked with have had little to no post high school education. And I've worked with do nothing, ignorant, assholes who have doctorates. I'm sure all of us have had similar experiences. So, yes, it helps, but it's not as important as other things.

Edit: also, to decide what masters to get I looked at the backgrounds of as many 12+ and ses people in my field and nearly all of them had a specific masters degree. So that's what I got.
And before I was even hired I had a highly valued professional certification my field.
My degrees were from brick and mortar state universities. The Masters was an online program. But it was fully accredited. Both my masters and Bach were also accredited by special accreditors for those fields. While managers probably don't care about that I think I got more out of them than I would have if I got u o p degrees.",1580515363

It has a larger, more blurred ‚ÄúTOOL AENIMA‚Äù print on spine, only Zoo logo on back (no BMG logo) smaller barcode¬†*(1 ¬º‚Äù L x 5/8‚Äù h)*,¬†barcode is 61422-31087-1,¬†**catalog number on spine 61422-31087-1**. Also a larger Zoo logo on spine*(logo is ¬º‚Äù diameter)* (as compared to the 72445-11087-1 pressing.) The vinyl labels are significantly different as well. The back bottom reads: ‚ÄúThe Zoo Entertainment logo is a trademark of Volcano Entertainment. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ñó ¬© 1996 Volcano Entertainment LLC 1540 Broadway New York, NY 10036 ‚Ä¢ Warning All Rights reserved ‚Ä¢ Unauthorized Duplication Is A Violation OF Applicable Laws ‚Ä¢ Manufactured and Distributed by BMG Entertainment, New York, NY ‚Ä¢ Printed in U.S.A. ‚Ä¢ 61422-31087-1‚Äù,¬†Has Tool Aenima sticker front top left of shrink wrap,¬†Has Parental Advisory Sticker on bottom right of front sleeve,¬†Shrink wrap sealed from front top to bottom center of back sleeve side,¬†Some copies have cut-out indicating promotional copy.

If it's truly mint the Hype Stickers are there. I own a 2nd pressing. [Toolvinyl.com](https://Toolvinyl.com)'s description is very precise.

If it's Mint, it could see for $1000. I purchased my VG+ copy for about $300. And the $300 was cheap. The seller noted that there was some noticeable crackle on the record. This was actually incorrect. The last track on side 1 is Useful Idiot. Useful Idiot is a recording of blank gramophone, it's recorded crackle. People avoided the listing because of the crackle notation. Absolutely no reason a Sealed copy wouldn't sell for $1000. None. It would sell fast, as well. I would auction it.",1580515364

What year was it that white people stopped being racist because they saw black people as an inferior subspecies and started being racist because black people were poor?

you have it backwards. what year was it, rather, that white people stopped being racist because black people were slaves and started being racist because they saw black people as an inferior subspecies? slavery predates and is the historical originator of racism.

&gt; Combat racism though safeguards against racism and I mean in all its forms. School desegregation efforts, getting more black people in positions of power, actually punishing racist institutions, and of course redistributing wealth directly to black people are all things that can be done to help. It'll take time but it took 400 years to get to where we are today anyway.

the only actionable policy here is wealth redistribution.

&gt; India has the same GDP per capita as Nigeria that's just false.

wrong. india is about 30% wealthier per capita than nigeria, and a hugely disproportionate share of indian immigrants are brahmins.

Your other complaint is that the book is fictional. Yes, it is fictional. But fiction is not the same as bullshit. Fiction purports to tell us real truths through the use of unreal events.

* You could hold a single button to continuously attack
* You could hold a single button to continuously block
* Because of #1 and #2, you the player needed absolutely zero dexterity or reaction time to play the game, removing almost all challenge from it
* Magic as consumables is always a FF no-no. Why Square hasn't learned from that mistake is beyond me.

Note that KH3 (and KH1/2) didn't have any of these problems. So for FF15 to be modeled after KH's battle system to have all these issues was just sad.

Starting in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan &amp; Georgia. There needs to be a rebellious effort with getting people registered to vote now. Not in Sept or Oct bc it will be far too late. What is it going to take?! There are too many able bodied people that don‚Äôt ever bother to vote and fellow Americans need them to Stand the Fuck Up &amp; Vote!

Don‚Äôt tell them Who to vote for Please just get them to the booth. Using a mobile tool to verify your status is the easiest step I can think of then follow directions from there based on location.

My suggestion is using https://votesaveamerica.com/

We can‚Äôt just throw money at this. We need boots on the ground getting voters to turn out. There is too much at stake and these are some scary motherfuckers that are in power right now. This is only their first act of saying We didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.

Please think of what it would take to combat widespread voter suppression bc that is the front lines. For now.",1580515368

The major differences are that on mine, the mouse is reversed, the actuation distance is significantly shorter(~3-5mm), I assumed control with one foot(left clicking is big toe, right clicking is left side of foot, potentially an issue if your friend has impacted fine motor control of her foot), the hinge is a thinner curve on mine with a more rigid ""pedal"" section, and there are no endstops on mine.

To make any more suggestions or comments though, we would probably need to talk to your friend more and see what movements are easier for her to make(the localized-bending pedal design of mine or the thinner bendier pedal of yours. Mine I designed specifically for the foot to rest on the pedals and mostly using the toes to push the buttons. Yours looks like it would take more of an ankle movement to actuate, but I can't be certain. Also, I am no physical therapist or an engineer of any kind.). The actuation distance would also be very important, and could be adjusted with the inclusion of a couple of screws where the pedal hits the mouse. Also the angle of the foot should be observed to prevent discomfort from the foot being angled too far towards the shin, which your design is significantly better at avoiding without becoming overly large.",1580515368

**""Ahhh,""** Ambrose let out a satisfied sigh as his backside hit the warmth cushion of the bed. *Finally,* he thought, feeling wearing after a long day of tedious work. It wasn't hard labor, mainly going over documents and records, while being constantly interrupted, but walking around was enough to get his muscles feeling weary regardless.

Shifting in his bed, he rolled onto his side, allowing his head to sink into the pillow as he pulled the thick, soft blanket over him. He practically looked like a rolled-up sausage at then. But it was no matter, slowly his eyes closed as he wore a comforting smile and sleep washed over him.

*2 seconds later...*

Knock. Knock.

Ambrose's eyes shot wide open, startled by the noise. Anger began to course through his veins then as he shook, yanking the blanket off of him violently. **""Fuck sake!""** He shouted. **""Can a man not get a second of rest without another blasted interruption!?""** The sound of his bare feet stomping toward the door could be heard clearly on the other side, giving the ground a slight rumble.

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/entitledparents requires all accounts to be at least **4 days old** AND have **at least 100 comment karma** in order to create new threads. Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit.  

Comment karma is *not* the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details. If you're on mobile, use your fucking browser. **Go to https://old.reddit.com/user/me/ to see both kinds of karma.** Use desktop mode. If you claim to have enough comment karma because you don't understand there are 2 kinds of karma, you will be banned.

There have been a few people coming on here and claiming the weapon balance is ‚Äúfine‚Äù becuase all they play is HC. I know that sounds crazy but a lot of people have actually said that on this sub. 

I think the M4 is the most dominant rifle in the game; and frankly, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really close. Its base stats combined with its versatility make it an extremely dominant weapon. The kilo is the close second stats wise but it‚Äôs not as good due to its lack of versatility.

The FAL, AK47, TAR21, and Oden are in a good place. The Oden is pretty strong of those 4 while the FAL is the most underwhelming of that group but overall those are fine. 

The SCAR, M13, and Famas should probably receive greater buffs. The M13 has poor stats compared to the M4 and Kilo. It also kinda has versatility issues because the blackout rounds are pretty bad given the fact that they‚Äôre only available in 30 rounds. 

The SCAR is okay stat-wise but has major versatility issues. You have to use certain attachments on the SCAR for it to be viable. Most of its attachments are pretty bad and have no place in the game. 

The famas is just bad for a burst gun. If there was a full auto option then that could potentially fix all of the famas‚Äô issues. It just has really bad range for a burst gun.",1580515371

She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do.

I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Bernie to be president and fix this broken country.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O brexit, enfim, aconteceu. Depois de tr√™s anos e meio do referendo votado pelos brit√¢nicos e tr√™s adiamentos de prazo, o Reino Unido [iniciou sua separa√ß√£o da Uni√£o Europeia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/e-se-o-brexit-fosse-contado-como-o-divorcio-de-um-casal.shtml) (UE) nesta sexta-feira (31), ap√≥s 47 anos como membro. √â o primeiro dos 28 pa√≠ses a sair do bloco desde sua cria√ß√£o, em 1958.

 Em Londres,[ a noite hist√≥rica ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/parlamento-europeu-ratifica-acordo-do-brexit-e-abre-caminho-para-saida-britanica.shtml)foi comemorada pelos apoiadores do [brexit](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2019/brexit/) na pra√ßa do Parlamento. Eles come√ßaram a encher o gramado entre o Pal√°cio e a Abadia de Westminster no in√≠cio da tarde e ali ficaram, mesmo com frio e garoa, at√© a hora t√£o esperada.

 No momento que oficializou a sa√≠da, √†s 23h (hor√°rio local, 20h em Bras√≠lia e 0h em Bruxelas, onde fica a Comiss√£o Europeia), a celebra√ß√£o ganhou ares de R√©veillon. Em um tel√£o, foi exibida uma contagem regressiva, seguida pelo hino ""God Save the Queen"" (Deus salve a rainha).

  

 Pela pra√ßa do Parlamento cheia de bandeiras do Reino Unido, as Union Jacks, circularam brit√¢nicos com placas com frases como ‚Äúindependence day‚Äù (dia da independ√™ncia) e ‚Äúour country again‚Äù (nosso pa√≠s de novo), cartazes com ataques a emissoras de TV e de apoio a Boris e ao presidente dos EUA, 

[Donald ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/06/trump-diz-querer-acordo-substancial-com-reino-unido-apos-brexit.shtml)[Trump](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/06/trump-diz-querer-acordo-substancial-com-reino-unido-apos-brexit.shtml).

 Pouco depois das 21h, um palco montado na lateral da abadia conduziu o p√∫blico. Empres√°rios e pol√≠ticos que ficaram famosos por defender o brexit discursaram, como Tim Martin, dono de uma rede de pubs, e Michelle Dewberry, que venceu a vers√£o inglesa do reality show ‚ÄúO Aprendiz‚Äù.

 √Äs 22h (19h em Bras√≠lia), o primeiro-ministro Boris Johnson, ciente de que metade do pa√≠s ainda se sente derrotada e com movimentos de independ√™ncia ganhando for√ßa, foi √† TV pregar a uni√£o. ""Nosso trabalho como governo, o meu trabalho, √© unir o pa√≠s e nos levar adiante"", disse.

  ""√â o in√≠cio de uma nova era em que n√£o aceitamos mais que suas escolhas de vida, as escolhas de vida da sua fam√≠lia, dependam de qual parte do pa√≠s voc√™ cresceu"", afirmou. ""Este √© o momento em que come√ßamos a nos unir e a subir de n√≠vel.""

 Boris prometeu ainda uma ""nova era"" de coopera√ß√£o com a UE e disse esperar que a sa√≠da se torne um ""sucesso impressionante"". ""Isso n√£o √© o fim, mas um come√ßo"", disse. ""N√≥s desejamos que esse seja o come√ßo de uma nova era de coopera√ß√£o amig√°vel entre a UE e uma Gr√£-Bretanha cheia de energia.""

 No mesmo hor√°rio, uma proje√ß√£o de luzes na fachada da resid√™ncia oficial do primeiro-ministro, no n√∫mero 10 da rua Downing, iniciou a contagem regressiva da √∫ltima hora antes do brexit. 

 Alvo de debate nas √∫ltimas semanas, o sino do Big Ben, o rel√≥gio que fica na torre do Parlamento, n√£o badalou. A torre est√° em reforma e, para que o sino fosse reativado, o custo seria de 500 mil libras para os cofres p√∫blicos. Alguns presentes, no entanto, levaram seus pr√≥prios sinos. 

 Organizado pelo grupo Leave Means Leave (sair significa sair), o evento teve como estrela Nigel Farage, pol√≠tico que defende a sa√≠da do Reino Unido da UE h√° quase 30 anos. 

 ""A guerra acabou: n√≥s ganhamos‚Äù, disse √† multid√£o. ""Esse √© o momento mais importante da hist√≥ria moderna da nossa grande na√ß√£o.‚Äù

 L√≠der do Partido do Brexit, ele comandou a contagem regressiva. Junto a outros 72 representantes brit√¢nicos, deixou nesta sexta seu cargo no [Parlamento Europeu](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/brexit-entra-em-vigor-com-ameaca-ao-balanco-de-poder-na-uniao-europeia.shtml).

 Esse √© um dos poucos efeitos imediatos do brexit. Os eurodeputados do Reino Unido n√£o participar√£o mais das decis√µes tomadas pela Casa, e o pa√≠s encerrou sua atua√ß√£o em todas as institui√ß√µes e os compromissos da UE.

 Nesta sexta, o Parlamento Europeu e outras institui√ß√µes ligadas ao bloco, como o Conselho da UE, retiraram as bandeiras do Reino Unido de suas fachadas nas sedes em Bruxelas e em Estrasburgo (Fran√ßa). A bandeira da Uni√£o Europeia, por sua vez, foi removida da embaixada brit√¢nica na UE em Bruxelas. 

 J√° o livre com√©rcio e a circula√ß√£o de pessoas n√£o ser√£o alterados at√© pelo menos 31 de dezembro de 2020. Essa √© a data para o fim do per√≠odo de transi√ß√£o que come√ßa agora e, durante o qual, Reino Unido e UE ter√£o que negociar e definir os detalhes das regras que v√£o reger a nova rela√ß√£o. 

 Outro vencedor desta noite foi Boris, que assumiu o cargo em julho de 2019 com a promessa de concretizar o brexit. L√≠der do Partido Conservador, ele foi um dos pol√≠ticos por tr√°s da campanha do Vote Leave (vote pela sa√≠da) durante o referendo de junho de 2016. 

 O brexit foi decidido ali: 52% dos brit√¢nicos votaram a favor da sa√≠da do pa√≠s do bloco, enquanto 48% foram contra. 

 Uma divis√£o n√£o s√≥ entre os eleitores (17,4 milh√µes x 16,1 milh√µes), mas tamb√©m entre os pa√≠ses que formam o Reino Unido. Enquanto Inglaterra (53,4%) e Pa√≠s de Gales (52,5%) tiveram maioria pr√≥-brexit, [Esc√≥cia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/musica-cantada-apos-aprovacao-do-brexit-marca-inicio-de-ano-novo-na-escocia.shtml) (62%) e Irlanda do Norte (55,8%) tiveram maioria contra.

 O argumento dos euroc√©ticos √© que a Uni√£o Europeia imp√µe controle excessivo sobre os pa√≠ses, amea√ßando suas escolhas e decis√µes.

 ‚ÄúEsperamos muito tempo por este dia. Amo a Europa, mas detesto a Uni√£o Europeia. Eles querem nos controlar, fazer nossas leis, pegar nosso dinheiro‚Äù, diz Julie, educadora que prefere n√£o revelar o sobrenome e veio de Yorkshire (320 km de Londres) para a festa do brexit.

 ‚ÄúQueremos fazer com√©rcio com outros pa√≠ses, especialmente os da Commonwealth, n√£o s√≥ um pequeno bloco de 28 pa√≠ses‚Äù, afirmou.

 Para Julie, a pior parte da espera de mais de tr√™s anos foi ser considerada ‚Äúracista‚Äù e ‚Äúsem intelig√™ncia‚Äù por grupos antibrexit. ‚ÄúFomos estereotipados de uma forma muito ruim, demonizados. √â horr√≠vel.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúAgora poderemos fazer o que quisermos, quando quisermos, porque todas as leis e regula√ß√µes ser√£o feitas aqui em Londres, e n√£o na Europa‚Äù, comemorava Kevin Russell, que veio de Milton Keynes (74 km da capital).

 Pela manh√£, o discurso da primeira-ministra escocesa, Nicola Sturgeon, foi na dire√ß√£o oposta do de Boris. L√≠der do partido nacionalista escoc√™s (SNP) e antibrexit, ela disse que o momento era de ""tristeza tingida de raiva"" e que a independ√™ncia da Esc√≥cia ""nunca esteve t√£o pr√≥xima"". 

 ""O brexit colocou a Esc√≥cia no caminho errado. Precisamos voltar para o caminho certo assim que poss√≠vel"", afirmou.

 Em Londres, onde 60% dos eleitores votaram pela perman√™ncia na UE, o prefeito Sadiq Khan declarou que a cidade vai ""continuar recebendo ideias e talentos de todas as partes do mundo, independentemente da cor da pele, do passaporte e da bandeira nacional"".

 Na tarde de sexta, ele abriu a prefeitura para oferecer ""apoio jur√≠dico e emocional"" para cidad√£os da UE que residem na capital. 

 Das mais de 3 milh√µes de pessoas da UE que vivem no Reino Unido, 1 milh√£o est√° na cidade. E todos os que est√£o no pa√≠s h√° mais de cinco anos podem se inscrever, at√© junho de 2021, em um programa de perman√™ncia de longo prazo, chamado de ""settlement scheme"". 

 Parte desses europeus do continente participou na quinta de mais uma rodada de protestos antibrexit, com vig√≠lias e caminhadas para lamentar a ‚Äúdespedida"".

 Mas a noite foi mesmo dos que se op√µem √† Uni√£o Europeia. E n√£o s√≥ brit√¢nicos. Uma dezena de franceses aproveitou a ocasi√£o para divulgar o movimento ""frexit"". 

 ‚ÄúHoje, com a Uni√£o Europeia, a Fran√ßa n√£o pode fazer nada por sua economia. Viemos aqui para mostrar que muitos franceses tamb√©m querem sair do bloco‚Äù, diz Mattis Lebrun, estudante parisiense que mora em Bristol (170 km de Londres).",1580515377

"askanatheist","t5_2s9m8","&gt;I identify the baseline expectation for one to consider him/herself an atheist is belief that no God--capitalized, lowercase, singular, plural, neutral, involved, distant, etc.--exists.

The broader definition is that there is no belief that a god exists, I would argue that that is the baseline.

&gt;Beyond that, I recognize ideas about atheism can be as varied as the atheists who possess them. 

Well, atheism is a single position on a single issue. Atheists, like men with moustaches, can have varied ideas and positions about anything else.

&gt;I wonder if any of you think it is possible to misrepresent atheism given how broad its ideas can be after the baseline.

When someone says atheism is the belief that no gods exist, rather than the lack of belief that any gods exist, you kinda are misrepresenting it.

&gt;An example of this to me would be praying. Why would an atheist pray? To whom would an atheist pray?

If you're praying to a god that you believe in, then you demonstrably are not an atheist.",1580515377

"TechNewsToday","t5_2sjnq","There were so many things that could have been done differently, with little effort, to have it make more sense. As one small example, instead of having Euron nonsensically snipe her dragon out of the air from behind a mountain, they could have had that be the thing that sent Daenerys into a psychotic rage by having the damn dragon die at the battle of King‚Äôs Landing. I also think the night king should have gotten a hold of Daenerys at the Battle of Winterfell, forcing Jon to stab the night king through Dany, at her urging. Thus fulfilling the Azor Ahai prophesy by killing his true love, and granting Jon lightbringer. Then Dany could have either survived somehow (maybe Valyrian steel/dragon glass can‚Äôt hurt her, like fire?) Or Melisandre was there she maybe could have brought Dany back. Just spitballing, but I would‚Äôve done a lot of things differently. Having Arya take out the Night King made zero sense, and was only scripted to be unexpected, as the only consideration.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Well nothing in real science is certain, it's built right into the scientific method, rigorous testing and retesting of the same experiment. Even findings we declare as ""laws of physics"" are still uncertain, Newton's Law were shown again and again to be the truth for hundreds of years. It wasn't until the 1900s when we started developing special relativity that we found out Newton's laws are actually incorrect and totally fall apart if you start talking about large enough (or small enough) things.

My point is that good science will never claim 100% certainty on anything, and IPCC is particularly good at giving the context of how certain they are on things which is one of the reasons I consider them as a reliable source. Almost any statement they make that isn't a direct measurement ends with a confidence level. For example (From AR5 pg: 371):

&gt;Projected changes in mean and extreme winds and waves were assigned low confidence (Seneviratne et al., 2012) owing to limited studies. Although there has been an increase in studies addressing future wave climate change (Hemer et al., 2013), generally low confidence remains in projected wave climate change (except for medium confidence over the Southern Ocean), and this is due to uncertainties in future winds, particularly those associated with storms (see WGI AR5 Section 13.7).

It's not that everything has large uncertainty. We know there is more CO2 in the atmosphere now than 10 years ago, you can just measure that. Through known physical properties we know that certain molecules will trap electromagnetic energy from the sun (some better than others), so the statement that more of these molecules will increase the earth's temperature can be said with high confidence (though not 100%). The claim that this will produce a positive feedback loop and have an exponential or polynomial acceleration is something that must be said with low confidence and high uncertainty because there are far too many variables to have an accurate prediction.

We do sound quite alike :). It was that sort of refusal to blindly trust others that lead me to research it as much as I have and reach my current opinion on the matter. I actually have been skeptical of climate change my whole life, I was taught by my parents that it was just political crap by the Democrats. But every time I discussed it, everyone's goal seamed to be to disprove it, rather than actually figure out what's going on. So I felt I needed to look at it myself. Luckily I have kind of a sciencey background, my college made me take a bunch of physics classes, so I was able to start from base concepts and at least prove to myself that greenhouse gasses actually do function to trap energy from the sun (which gets converted into heat). From there it was a matter of finding information to expand on that from a source that seemed scientifically rigorous and relatively apolitical. All of that research is why I speak relatively highly of IPCC. They aren't to be trusted unconditionally but they seem to be interested in the actual information, usually not falling in line with the naratives of either ""side"".

As for Carbon Dioxide, I definitely agree it is absolutely essential for life. We are, after all, carbon based life forms. When you burn us we literally emit CO2 when our carbon combines with oxygen in the air. We also breath out CO2 as a way to get rid of some of the carbon from all of the carbon based life forms we eat. It's really really important. This is were I get really upset when people talk about ""killing the earth"". The earth has been through so much more, it freezes, it gets hit by asteroids, it doesn't give a crap about the CO2 level. This isn't some righteous undertaking, it's pure self interest, we need the world to be in the exact state we as humans like. Humans are incredible in that they adapt their environment to them, rather than the other way around. The world's climate is no different. In that respect rising CO2 levels may be an issue.

Ignoring all other variables I would expect increasing CO2 to initially cause a boom in plant life, as plants of course breath CO2. Shortly after we would have an increase in oxygen since all of those plants are exhaling oxygen out. In that sense this is quite good, as long as it's not enough to cause oxygen poisoning, increased oxygen seems to be a positive for humans. We see it when athletes come down from high altitudes, they perform better due to more oxygen. The issue with CO2 isn't that it's a poison or anything like that, the issue is that it has the right qualities to cause a greenhouse effect. I highly suggest looking up how exactly greenhouse gasses work if you haven't already because it's core to the climate change discussion. Essentially different molecules absorb different frequencies of light. Carbon dioxide particularly likes light around the infrared spectrum. A lot of light comes in from the sun in the visible spectrum, so it passes right through CO2. But then it hits the earth and loses a little bit of energy, you can feel the energy it loses when the light hits your skin. When light loses energy it's wavelength shifts, so it shifts down to the infrared spectrum. When it bounces back up to leave the earth, it hits CO2 and now that it's in a spectrum CO2 likes, it absorbs it, keeping that energy in the earth and heating it up. This would suggest that higher CO2 levels will end up warming the planet.

How that will effect us is still up to debate. There's some reasonable looking theories that suggest that it will self regulate. In one of ICPP's AR reports they talk about how increased temperature could cause more evaporated water, which means more clouds that tend to reflect a lot of light, keeping this whole green house effect from growing out of control. Other reasonable looking theories suggest there will be a feedback loop causing rapid temperature growth. Life in general on earth would probably be fine but humans may find it less hospitable. Ultimately we don't know and anyone who tells you they do with confidence probably has a political agenda. What we do know is that we do pretty well at our current temperature so it makes sense to me to at least curb our greenhouse gas output where it is not too unreasonable or expensive to do so.

I looked into The  Verde Island, that was a pretty interesting read, good suggestion. I actually love this example because it plays pretty well into my current understanding. Higher CO2, plus all of that nutrient rich volcanic soil causes flourishing life, new species, and I suspect higher oxygen levels as well though I can't find a direct statement on the fact.

Anyway, if you actually read all of this then I must apologize for writing you a whole book haha. Your post definitely made me think and writing it all out helps me make sure I agree with my own thoughts and they make sense to me. If you have any counter comments I'd be very interested in hearing them, though this thread has gotten pretty long at this point so I wouldn't blame you for leaving it here :).

The next girl at the table had a lute in her hands and at least three more musical instruments strapped to her back. Her nametag read: Gloria.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Gloria said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bard‚Ä¶ in case you couldn‚Äôt tell.‚Äù

‚ÄúKinda obvious,‚Äù Sheon said, then held his hand to his chest. ‚ÄúWarrior.‚Äù

‚ÄúWanna hear a song?‚Äù she said with a wink. ‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôll fall in love once I start singing.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure!‚Äù

Sheon was genuinely excited - he loved artistic women. But when she placed her hands on the strings, everything went downhill. She plucked at the chords sloppily, making them sound ugly and out of tune. And just when he thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse, she started singing.

‚ô´*The lion and the bear, taxed by the woods, leaves the woods, finds the trees.*

*Don‚Äôt allow, your honey to waste, the bear will come, and tax you.*‚ô´

This continued for the duration of their time together. The lyrics were ridiculous, and none of it rhymed. All Sheon could do was sit there and withstand it ‚Äì counting seconds until the gong eventually rang again.

‚ÄúWhat did you think?‚Äù Gloria asked.

In an effort to be polite and not upset her, Sheon just smiled and gave a thumbs up while leaving the table. He plopped into the next seat, broken and feeling hopeless.  *Yeah...I‚Äôm not going to find love here.*

Shoen stared at the woman across from him, who was *clearly* a beastmaster. A wolf and a giant lizard sat on either side of her. She wore patches of animal fur, covering little surface area and showing off her tattooed tribal makings. Her nametag read: Tanya.

‚ÄúSometin wrong,‚Äù she said in her thick accent.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Sheon said, barely putting any effort into the response. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ a little discouraged. Things haven‚Äôt been going great.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Tanya said. ‚ÄúNot yu. Sometin wrong wit dis place. Ma companions, day smell sometin day don‚Äôt like. *I* smell it tu. Ma nose strong. Yu keep an eye on dat skinney boi op at da stage.‚Äù

Sheon looked at the host again. The man *did* seem weird. Covered slightly by the tilt of his black fedora, his eyes glowed. The more Sheon thought about it, the more concerned he became. This place was on the outskirts of the kingdom, far away from authority. Most events charged coin to attend, but this one didn‚Äôt. As he scanned the room once more, his heart sank as he noticed the unnecessarily large amount of tables, chairs, and other pieces of furniture scattered throughout the room.

This was a trap.

Sheon stood, and as fast as lightning, drew his sword.

‚ÄúMimics!‚Äù he yelled, loud enough to reach over the room‚Äôs chatter.

Sheon lifted his sword above his head, and swept down with a long slice. After piercing through the wood, the sword met flesh, and the table screeched in pain. He yanked the sword out just as the creature began to sprout arms out of its sides. Tanya‚Äôs beasts didn‚Äôt hesitate to jump on the creature and start ripping it apart.

Chaos broke loose in the tavern. Countless furniture pieces sprouted teeth and limbs, and most of them took an immediate bite out of whoever was sitting closest. After the pre-emptive attack, the mimics doubled the attendees.

Sheon watched in shock as everyone battled around him. A radiant light came from Miley, who ran from person to person trying to heal wounds and revive those who were dead or unconscious. A bubble surrounded her, acting as a force field and repelling some of the creatures - but, there were too many of them. The mimics swarmed her, shattering through the bubble and eating her alive.

Gloria stood on one of the few tables that *wasn‚Äôt* a mimic, and attempted to sing something that would empower the remaining survivors. She plucked nervously at the lute strings and her quivering voice prevented any harmony from coming out. Desperate, she tried using her instruments as blunt objects, breaking them on the nearby mimics. It did nothing, and they gobbled her up after she fell off the table.

To his left, Tanya had problems of her own. Her companions managed to rip apart quite a few mimics, but grew tired and eventually took fatal wounds. Losing her animals put her in a rage, and she began using her own sharp claws to rend the monstrosities. Her tunnel vision allowed one of the creatures to get behind her ‚Äì which bit her head off.

Sheon was about to flee until he saw her ‚Äì Leena, fighting toward the center of the room. He watched, mesmerized as she demonstrated what her invented class was capable of. She was throwing orbs Sheon had never seen before. They were black, with a tiny bit of sparkling rope sticking out the top. The orbs would fly into the mouths of the mimics, and the creatures would burst with fire.

The wooden boxes acted as companion-ish instruments. Lenna threw them, and when they landed, they constructed themselves into miniature versions of the magical towers used to defend the kingdoms boarders. The little mechanized turrets automatically aimed and fired magic missiles at whichever enemy was closest ‚Äì and with four of them active at once, they were doing quite a bit of damage. Her creativity, fierceness, originality, and beauty were intoxicating ‚Äì and Sheon fell in love instantly.

Despite Leena‚Äôs incredible display, she was beginning to become overrun. Sheon leapt in to block a particularly large mimic just before it grabbed her. Then he thrusted his sword strait into its mouth. The mimic screeched before dying, and Sheon turned to check on Leena. She gave him a thankful smile, and he smiled back. They danced with each other. He blocked and sliced, giving her time to prep and throw more exploding orbs. Mimics fell one by one, and after a blur of combat, the creatures all died at the mercy of Sheon and Leena.

After checking the stage Sheon noticed the host - whatever he was ‚Äì had escaped. *Until next time.* He thought.

Sheon knew it was going to be a hassle getting the blood cleaned off his sword and shield, but nothing bothered him right now, because *there* she was.

So much happened outside the camera view and on other lanes, while the camera was locked onto the junglers for some reason. And, when literally all players are farming, I don't want to watch a jungle path, I can see that on the minimap. I would rather watch the lanes. Any lane.
And while I agree Selfmade did a good job, it wasn't nearly as good as the casters made it out to be, I don't understand where this focus came from. Hylissang did a fucking god-tier job on Thresh with amazing hooks, positioning, predictions etc, and gets half the amount of praise. Selfmade did a lot of good, but also did a few mistakes that even cost them some kills.

If the casters would point out and mention what Hyli did good, he should've easily won mvp. But I think the  exaggerated jungle hype won people over.. I'm even at the point where I'm suspicious to if the casters were told to focus and say good things about Selfmade..",1580515379

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O Senado americano decidiu nesta sexta-feira (31) que n√£o convocar√° novas testemunhas para depor no [processo de impeachment](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/trump-pede-rejeicao-rapida-de-impeachment-no-senado.shtml) do presidente Donald Trump, abrindo assim caminho para sua absolvi√ß√£o. 

 A medida era considerada a √∫ltima tentativa dos democratas para prolongar o processo contra o presidente dos EUA, mas a proposta foi derrubada com 51 votos contr√°rios e 49 a favor, ap√≥s mais de quatro horas de debate no plen√°rio.

 A maioria republicana na Casa, que barrou a proposta, tamb√©m deve absolver Trump na vota√ß√£o final, que ainda n√£o tem data para ocorrer.

 A expectativa era de que os senadores decidissem j√° nesta sexta o futuro de Trump, mas uma ala dos republicanos defende que a quest√£o fique para a pr√≥xima semana. 

 Caso isso aconte√ßa, a vota√ß√£o do impeachment deve coincidir com o in√≠cio das prim√°rias democratas, na segunda-feira (3/2), em Iowa.

 Quatro dos pr√©-candidatos do partido s√£o senadores ‚ÄîBernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar e Michael Bennet‚Äî, e a expectativa √© que eles fossem ao estado para participar dos √∫ltimos eventos de campanha dessa prim√°ria com o impeachment j√° resolvido.

  Assim, se a vota√ß√£o final do impeachment for adiada, eles podem ser obrigados a permanecer em Washington.

 O presidente √© acusado de abuso de poder por [pressionar o presidente da Ucr√¢nia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/09/trump-pediu-a-ucrania-para-investigar-filho-de-biden-mostra-transcricao-de-conversa.shtml), Volodimir Zelenski, a investigar [Joe Biden](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/10/biden-apoia-abertamente-impeachment-de-trump-pela-primeira-vez.shtml), l√≠der nas pesquisas entre os democratas para ser o candidato √† Presid√™ncia na elei√ß√£o de 2020 e ex-vice-presidente durante a gest√£o de Barack Obama. 

 Em 16 de janeiro, um √≥rg√£o do Congresso respons√°vel por auditar as contas do governo federal concluiu que Trump violou a lei ao reter uma ajuda militar de US$ 391 milh√µes para a Ucr√¢nia. 

 A verba foi aprovada pelos deputados para ajudar Kiev a [combater os separatistas apoiados pela R√∫ssia na parte oriental do pa√≠s](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/pressionado-putin-dilui-comemoracoes-por-anexacao-da-crimeia.shtml), mas retida pela Casa Branca como uma maneira de pressionar Zelenski a investigar Joe Biden e seu filho Hunter, que trabalhou no conselho de uma empresa de g√°s ucraniana.

 Para Trump, Biden teria agido para demitir um contestado procurador-geral da Ucr√¢nia que investigou a empresa de g√°s na qual o filho atuou.

 Hunter, por√©m, nunca foi alvo do inqu√©rito, e as apura√ß√µes se concentravam no per√≠odo anterior √† sua chegada √† companhia. 

 O presidente americano tamb√©m √© acusado de[ obstruir o Congresso](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/12/relatorio-de-impeachment-da-camara-acusa-trump-de-abuso-de-poder.shtml) ao atrapalhar as investiga√ß√µes depois que o epis√≥dio foi descoberto. O republicano nega todas as acusa√ß√µes e afirma que a oposi√ß√£o tenta fazer uma ca√ßa √†s bruxas contra seu governo.

 Os democratas defendiam a convoca√ß√£o de testemunhas, principalmente o ex-assessor da Casa Branca John Bolton, mas a maior parte dos republicanos era contra. 

 Bolton, [ex-assessor de Seguran√ßa Nacional](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/revelacao-de-ex-assessor-de-trump-pressiona-senadores-por-novos-depoimentos.shtml), escreveu um livro ainda n√£o publicado no qual detalha [que Trump disse a ele querer congelar a ajuda financeira √† Ucr√¢nia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/trump-condicionou-envio-a-ucrania-de-ajuda-a-abertura-inqueritos-diz-livro-de-john-bolton.shtml) at√© Kiev abrir investiga√ß√µes contra rivais democratas. A Casa Branca vetou a publica√ß√£o do manuscrito.

 Nesta sexta, o jornal The New York Times revelou que Bolton tamb√©m relata na obra que mais de dois meses antes de Trump [pedir ao presidente da Ucr√¢nia em um telefonema para investigar seus advers√°rios pol√≠ticos,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/09/leia-a-integra-da-transcricao-da-conversa-entre-trump-e-o-presidente-da-ucrania.shtml) o presidente o instruiu a ajud√°-lo na tarefa.

 Nesse cen√°rio, a oposi√ß√£o, que conta com 47 assentos no Senado, precisava do apoio de ao menos quatro republicanos moderados para conseguir autorizar as convoca√ß√µes. 

 Os democratas at√© conseguiram convencer dois republicanos ‚ÄîMitt Romney e Susan Collins‚Äî, mas os outros dois senadores que estavam em d√∫vida, Lisa Murkowski e Lamar Alexander, anunciaram ao longo desta sexta-feira que iriam votar contra o projeto, o que inviabilizou a aprova√ß√£o. 

 ""Dada a natureza partid√°ria desse impeachment desde o in√≠cio, cheguei √† conclus√£o de que n√£o haver√° um julgamento justo no Senado. N√£o acredito que a continua√ß√£o desse processo mude nada. √â triste para para admitir que, como institui√ß√£o, o Congresso fracassou "", afirmou Murkowski ao justificar seu voto.

 J√° Alexander chegou a criticar Trump ao anunciar sua decis√£o contr√°ria √† convoca√ß√£o de testemunhas e disse que o presidente agiu de maneira ""inapropriada ao pedir para um l√≠der estrangeiro investigar um advers√°rio pol√≠tico e barrar o envio de ajuda dos Estados Unidos para encorajar a investiga√ß√£o"". 

 Para o senador pelo estado do Tennessee, por√©m, isso n√£o √© motivo suficiente para aprovar o afastamento de um presidente. Outros senadores republicanos indicaram que concordam com ele na cr√≠tica √†s a√ß√µes de Trump. 

 L√≠der dos democratas no Senado, Chuck Schumer criticou a decis√£o dos advers√°rios.

 ""Se meus colegas republicanos se recusam at√© mesmo a convocar testemunhas e a ver documentos neste julgamento, este pa√≠s se encaminha para a maior opera√ß√£o de oculta√ß√£o desde Watergate"", disse ele, referindo-se ao esc√¢ndalo que levou o ent√£o presidente Richard Nixon a renunciar em 1974.

 A [novela sobre a convoca√ß√£o ou n√£o das testemunhas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/disputa-sobre-testemunhas-pode-marcar-fim-de-impeachment-de-trump.shtml) vinha se arrastando desde 18 de dezembro, quando a C√¢mara dos Representantes (equivalente √† C√¢mara dos Deputados) aprovou o impeachment contra o presidente, levando √† sua fase seguinte.

 O l√≠der dos republicanos no Senado, [Mitch McConnell](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/01/no-senado-defesa-de-trump-minimiza-revelacoes-de-manuscrito-de-ex-assessor.shtml), defendeu desde o in√≠cio que a Casa n√£o precisava convocar as testemunhas porque quem deveria ter feito isso eram os deputados.

 Mas a presidente da C√¢mara, a democrata Nancy Peolsi, recusou-se por 20 dias a enviar os artigos de impeachment para os senadores caso eles n√£o autorizassem a convoca√ß√£o de testemunhas. 

 No in√≠cio de janeiro, no entanto, ela acabou cedendo √† press√£o e decidiu enviar as acusa√ß√µes mesmo sem garantias de que as testemunhas seriam chamadas.

 Os democratas passaram ent√£o a pressionar os republicanos moderados para que autorizassem a convoca√ß√£o, mas no fim a estrat√©gia n√£o funcionou. 

 Desde o in√≠cio do processo, analistas consideravam pouco prov√°vel que a oposi√ß√£o conseguisse os dois ter√ßos do Senado necess√°rios para remover Trump do cargo. Permitir o depoimento de novas testemunhas, contudo, poderia provocar danos pol√≠ticos ao presidente enquanto ele busca a reelei√ß√£o.",1580515383

Part of why he's disliked within the party ranks is that he withheld his support for a long time during the previous primary and avoided the call to unity long after the campaign was lost.

"GovernmentBuilding","t5_27gdxa","Thanks for the response.

&gt; I guess my main question would be ""why?"" ie what process was it that led to them coming up with that formula.

It was changed from the previous 149 because urbanisation caused few rural constituencies to become mockery of local representation, there were 50 (exactly half of pre-1960 fptp constituencies) local districts back then with roughly equal population. It was decided that the number of constituencies needs to grow with population and land area needs to play some role (all land (except *Rainy Mountains*) is treated as if it had its pop. density increased by half of national pop. density).

&gt; ""why?"" D'Hondt will give you pretty proportionate outcomes, ... so it just seems a bit unnecessary.

Many D'Hodnt elections are actualy ran this way, where Hare quota seats are given first, which greatly simplifies the whole process. Top up seast being given after constituency seats makes a few elected independents not increase the size of the assembly.

&gt;&gt; preferential voting

&gt; What kind?

I meant to say approval voting, not preferential. I kinda have ""preferential"" associated with open list PR and by extension approval voting (here in Czech Republic, you can give up to 4 preferential votes to candidates on the list of the party you vote for, with candidates who get a vote on at lest 5% of the ballot taking priority).

&gt;&gt; a party-candidate bonus

&gt;&gt; A candidate must have at least valid ballots / 2 votes to win the seat.

The 50% constituency threshold was meant so that the local representatives are consensus based (also being a bit of an anti-bullet voting measure), but a third of the constituencies haven't elected anybody, so the party bonus was added (which only counts for the 50% threshold). The *Legislative Assembly* is mainly meant to be ideology based, so they don't want too many independents there. The *Insular Council*, on the other hand, is meant to be personality based (and there are many independents there).

&gt; Talk me through this.

The system I described is meant to be a extension of D21 voting method. The voters have both positive and negative votes and they can give a negative vote for each two positive votes they have given. The candidates who get negative score are eliminated. I don't have next round fleshed out yet.

&gt; Fine in principle but STV allocates all the seats so there would be no remaining seats?

The STV elections wouldn't have a amout of seats to fill, only a quota, the election is over, when there are less remaining votes than the quota (so no additional seat can be filled).

This system allows small minorities to be directly represented without needing an 10+ or even 20+ seats STV election.",1580515386

"EscapefromTarkov","t5_3aq6o","Somethings I noticed... Not arguing for or against either but. In that video you posted, when he fires on an empty mag you can see him lean forward. This means he likely flinches and pushes against the recoil when firing, so it appears to recoil less, though this is improper shooting and will throw your accuracy off. It's also recoiling heavily, IMO so much so he can only fire in 3 shot bursts, while your in game video is attempting full mag dumps...   


Real world 12.7x55 loads are much heavier than what you posted. I'm seeing 911gr, 744gr, and 1173gr loads listed which are FAR heavier than  the 260gr load in the 9x39. A heavy projectile like that will certainly cause a lot of recoil. 16-17grams (9x39) vs 48-76grams(12.7x55)  


You also have to factor in gas and bolt systems. For example, the AA-12 and Barretta shotguns typically have MUCH less bucking and muzzle rise compared to a Saiga12 using the same ammo because of recoil damping systems within the action.   
[https://youtu.be/WOoUVeyaY\_8?t=286](https://youtu.be/WOoUVeyaY_8?t=286)  


I think the recoil level is probably reasonable, due to that, but I'm sure the weapon could be balanced in other ways. It also has incredibly high base damage, which I believe is the point of the round, big bore, 'stopping power'   
If you want big pen, you need specially designed AP rounds, and also, importantly, velocity (which of course means more recoil) subsonic rounds are going to be handicapped in penetration for obvious reasons. In this game, you just have to accept certain calibers and projectiles are mainly best suited for 'soft' targets or one's wearing 'noob' armor that has low ballistic rating.",1580515386

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Correction on my part. You can get the DLC Pokemon for free.

Although in the Free version you can't transfer any Pokemon from Bank, you can trade Pokemon using Pokemon Go, Let's Go and SwSh.

The only issue is that you can't tell people what pokemon you want. You have to hope to find a room that is willing to trade you the Pokemon you want since you can only participate for the free version.

In order to get any DLC Pokemon or new Pokemon, this is the process:

1. Transfer Go, Let's Go or SwSh into Home.
2. Then use the Home app to trade with people.
3. You can use one wonder trade per time while holding 30 Pokemon max
4. You can only join rooms to trade, but can't open one yourself.

Basically Home gives you a free online way to trade by using a mobile app.

It is annoying to do, but it is best thing free players can do at this point instead of finding people locally.",1580515386

I want to be capable of asking for help.‚Äù Over time you can change that to ‚ÄúI am grateful I am making progress in asking others for help.‚Äù

It also helped me to start asking for help with the things in my life on which I was not attaching such an enormous emotional price tag. For example, I am completely capable of spring cleaning my house but I would ask for a sober sister to come help me. I practiced my ‚Äúseeking help‚Äù muscles, got my house cleaned and enjoyed fellowship. Slowly it has helped me be able to ask for help when I feel like I am drowning. It doesn‚Äôt happen often anymore but it still can. 

One of my major conflicts is this feeling that I look weak or silly if I need help. It helps me to understand that even if that were true, weakness is a better outcome than drunkeness. And finally, it really helps me to remember how good I feel when someone asks for my help. Asking another for help is a way of giving that gift to others.",1580515387

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A atriz Carolina Ferraz deu uma bronca nesta sexta (31) em Regina Duarte, que est√° assumindo a pasta da Cultura no governo Bolsonaro. Por √°udio, Ferraz pede para que Regina retire sua imagem de uma postagem que a colega de profiss√£o publicou no Instagram.

 Regina postou, mais cedo nesta sexta-feira (31), uma colagem com o retrato de artistas que estariam apoiando seu ingresso no governo. Ela aceitou nesta quarta assumir a pasta da Cultura.

 ""Regina n√£o imaginei que voc√™ fosse colocar minha foto ou a foto de qualquer um, n√©, colega nosso, sem at√© comentar ou pedir autoriza√ß√£o da gente, n√©"", inicia Ferraz.

 A Folha confirmou a autoria da mensagem enviada pelo WhatsApp. Ou√ßa aqui o √°udio:‚Äã

 ""Realmente, tor√ßo para que voc√™ consiga exercer e fazer a diferen√ßa em um governo que desprestigia tanto a classe art√≠stica, que persegue tanto a classe art√≠stica.""

  ""Voc√™, sendo uma artista que eu conhe√ßo h√° mais de 30 anos, espero que voc√™ fa√ßa a diferen√ßa. Mas eu n√£o quero ser usada como algu√©m que est√° ali no seu instagram, porque d√° a entender que eu apoio o governo Bolsonaro e eu n√£o apoio, Regina. Eu nunca aprovei e nunca compactuei com esse governo e inclusive n√£o votei no Bolsonaro.""

 No fim da mensagem, Ferraz pede ""com todo o carinho"", para que a colega pe√ßa √† sua equipe que retire a imagem da internet.

 Regina [est√° assumindo o comando da Secretaria Especial da Cultura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/regina-duarte-assume-orgao-dominado-por-defensores-de-guerra-cultural.shtml), ap√≥s a queda do dramaturgo Roberto Alvim, demitido por ter copiado frases do nazista Joseph Goebbels em um pronunciamento oficial.

 Na colagem que a atriz publicou, h√° fotos dos atores Carolina Ferraz, Marcio Garcia, Ary Fontoura, Mait√™ Proen√ßa, Beth Goulart e da autora de novelas Gloria Perez, entre outros.

 S√£o artistas que manifestaram apoio √† atriz durante o[ ""noivado""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/01/regina-duarte-diz-que-noivado-com-bolsonaro-foi-excelente-e-que-ainda-esta-tomando-pe-da-cultura.shtml) com Bolsonaro, termo usado por Regina para se referir ao per√≠odo em que estudou a estrutura da pasta, antes de aceitar a proposta.

 ""B√≥ra l√°, queridos, pela pluralidade cultural do nosso amado Brasil"", escreveu, com as imagens.

 A postagem da atriz soa como resposta aos diversos ataques da pr√≥pria classe art√≠stica. Entre os mais agressivos, [Jos√© de Abreu ](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/celebridades/2020/01/kim-kataguiri-diz-que-jose-de-abreu-age-como-terrorista-ao-atacar-regina-duarte.shtml)chegou a dizer em tom amea√ßador que poderia contar algum segredo dela: ""Eu sei o que fizemos na sua casa na Barra"", escreveu o ator no Instagram.

 ""Muita gente da classe apoia a Regina Duarte, mas n√£o tem coragem de vir a p√∫blico"", disse Proen√ßa, em uma entrevista ao jornal O Globo.

 ""Sei que voc√™ ir√° exercer a sua fun√ß√£o com o total comprometimento. Fico na torcida para que aqueles que criticam apenas para fomentar a oposi√ß√£o saibam avaliar os atos e n√£o as bandeiras"", disse Marcio Garcia, tamb√©m na rede social. ""Torcendo por todos n√≥s"", escreveu o ator Luiz Fernando Guimar√£es.",1580515388

For the first 90 years after independence, slavery was legal, genocide of the natives was ongoing, and even those black people who weren‚Äôt slaves were considered second-class citizens, along with women. For 100 years after that, large portions of the country had in place what was effectively a system of apartheid that continued to keep people of color in a separate caste. It‚Äôs only on the last half century that we‚Äôve seen anything approaching democracy in this country, and even that period has been plagued by inequality of race, gender, and social standing. 

I‚Äôm not pointing this out to be an asshole, but just to make the point that the systems we‚Äôve had in place over the centuries are not immaculate and faultless. These founding myths are helping no one. Our institutions change and evolve. Sometimes, they become obsolete and need to be replaced entirely. But for most of this country‚Äôs history, our government has been, in one way or another, undemocratic, if not outright anti-democratic.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Beware of reading the Quran in an English translation. People blatantly twist the words from the original meaning to push propaganda. For example, you‚Äôll see a verse that calls the moon a ‚Äúlight‚Äù.

[And made the moon therein a [reflected] light and made the sun a burning lamp?](https://quran.com/71/16)

However, the actual word used for ‚Äúlight‚Äù does not give any indication that it is a reflected light. The wording in parenthesis is entirely fictional, created by people who wanted to keep the Quran up with the times where we know that the moon doesn‚Äôt actually produce light on its own. The word used is ‚Äúnoor‚Äù, which also happens to be one of Allah‚Äôs 99 names- the 93rd, in fact. The lord is certainly not calling himself a ‚Äúreflected light‚Äù there at all.

This was just one example. Point is, you will have to be extremely wary of English translations, for both Quran and Hadith. People have had years to twist the translations into tricks and traps for newcomers. 

I suggest a basic knowledge of Arabic letters, grammar, and vocabulary. Muslims will be extremely vicious about this and will accuse you of being ignorant of the language, nevermind the fact that the lord of the universe was pathetically restricted to one human language.

I got a good job that pays me more than before but the fact that I have to pay so much to the government is insane since I get no benefits at all as a single dude. I don‚Äôt even make that much money.

I had to pay first month last month and security to move which set me back and I had plans for the tax return. Most of my return is going to go to pay NY state back. Just hate the situation I am in.

The Elite of the country can solve the whole crisis with one decision; cut the fortunes of the 1% (who were getting paid 15 to 20% interest rates on their deposits), but none of the elite power has the interest, the competence nor willingness to do any actual reform and prefer to seek IMF intervention (still floating for now, but that's where we headed it seems).",1580515390

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","A lot of people in this thread claiming it's the format/coding, that's not true and my evidence is that theres billions of scripts for things like LocateCursorDown(): etc (not the right code line but point valid) you can write scripts to move your mouse around and click, if your script can put the mouse on the box and click theres nothing stopping it from working as the code is registered identical to if you do it yourself. I use scripts to skip several ""I'm not a bot"" things on my computer at home or to automatically maintain things like inventory clearing on games etc 

Ie, if me moving my mouse tells the code in the background LocateCursorLeft(): and my script has the exact same ""LocateCursorLeft():"" theres no way for the site to distinguish my movement from my scripts movement

Edit someone below me pointed out bots dont have a mouse to move and just use a command to directly acknowledge the link its told to click (despite cursor not being on it) afaik and in my experience this isnt the case, you can actually use code lines to move the cursor, and I've yet to find a browser link myself that a line of code can acknowledge and open without a RunLink(): command or physical click, though I'm really new to coding and they most definitely can be correct and not something I've crossed yet",1580515390

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; The most maintainable systems I‚Äôve seen had architects that pushed for:

&gt;  Fewer features by being choosy about which features to implement

Makes sense.

&gt; Fewer technologies rather than more - e.g. avoiding polyglot microservices

Makes sense.

&gt; Sticking to the same patterns over time, even if they‚Äôre imperfect (but good enough)

Well ... not so sure.

&gt; Fewer services, technologies, 3rd party components, etc

Makes sense.

&gt; Fewer lines of code, relying more on third-party libraries and services

Well ...

left-pad.

Becoming too dependent on external code is not always great - see the
adChromium monoculture run by Google. KDE used to have konqueror!
Even if only 3 people used it globally ... that's better than letting Google
act as the de-facto web-controller and control the flow of information to
you.

&gt; Cleaning up old unused parts

Makes sense.

&gt; Fewer moving parts overall

Makes sense.

Unfortunately, many of these ""best practice"" are also living in lala
wonderland. Less code is better, ok - and you get more features
with less code? Rarely. Some languages are more awful than
others too, so have a higher maintenance code.

I think many of these articles are quite bad, because they are like
assuming that we are in control of everything, at all times, and able
to solve everything too. So they illustrate all that works well but ...
... reality isn't quite the same way. Something is not right here when
articles refer to paradise, but reality has all these mega-code bases
that are awful to work with.",1580515390

In 2016, people in Wales received 79 pounds per capita from the EU according to Cardiff University.

Because: 79-50=29. I'd gain money! 

However, according to your example: 

I would have to pay you 50 pounds. You would pay me 23. I would lose 27 pounds! I'd lose money! 

Because: 23-50= -27. 

And anyway where did you pull 23 pounds from? If you don't live in the UK, why get involved now at all? Why are you commenting? Also, just send me the 29 quid on PayPal please.

"neuro","t5_2qu9b",""" At the neuro-computational level, these ideas are realised in the hierarchical organisation of the brain. Prior expectations are realised top-down via NMDA and GABA signalling. Any mismatch between those priors and incoming information is signalled bottom-up via AMPA receptors. The impact of a given PE on future predictions is governed by its precision (or inverse variance). This computational motif is recapitulated across successive layers in a hierarchical manner ‚Äì moving away from raw sensory data, the representations become increasingly complex, multifaceted ([Mesulam, 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5105325/#bibr79-0269881116650087)) and perhaps distant from the immediate evidence of perception. The priors from the level above impact the signals from the level below. Different neuromodulators (dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, oxytocin) may implement the precision of priors and PEs in particular processing hierarchies. ""

Cats are very territorial and most will be happiest spending their lives in the same place with the same basic routine. They do usually want some novelty within that routine, though. They want new things to play with and ""hunt,"" and will often get bored with old toys. 

Cats can definitely get bored living indoors, but they're much less likely to if they have things to do--toys to play with, places to climb, surfaces to scratch, interesting things to smell and chew on, a window where they can watch what's happening outside, and people or other pets to interact with. 

Some easy ways to make your indoor cat's life more interesting: make sure she has some place comfy to sit and watch out a window--people jokingly call this cat TV since they'll basically binge watch all day. Also, buy or make her some foraging toys that allow her to ""hunt"" treats during the day. This will help keep her both physically and cognitively active.",1580515394

Are you still going to apply for internships through the APPIC match system? If so, then it makes no difference where you are.

&gt;And I still think it fits based on your description anyway. 

It's literally APPIC's definition. Go ahead and ask them.

&gt;It's not a phone session. It's diagnostic. 

Phone session is just the name for the category, it can be either assessment or intervention.

&gt;Your telling me if I'm conducting a clinical interview over the phone due to geographical challenges that doesn't count as client contact? 

Yes, that's what the definition is. This is not to say that I agree it should be this, but rather that this is what the rules are. Telehealth can count as client contact hours, but it requires videoconferencing, not just phone calls or audio. What you have been describing doesn't count. 

&gt;Because my professional college disagrees. 

APPIC defines these activity categories, not your university or the college of psychology in Canada. It's their system that they have authority to regulate. If you are planning to apply for internships through APPIC, you have to use their definitions, not your own, your university's, or the college's.

Yes, I think it's possible.
No, I don't think most people are in the right places to be found. Men at bars are usually there for sex/hookups. Go to a bookstore, bookclub, cooking class, charity event. That's where relationship-minded men are.

I also believe how men view you is important. A big issue with being gay is ""who's the girl?"" ""Who's the man?"" Well, whenever I actively pursue a guy, it never goes well. I have this ""if I don't make him notice me, I'll miss out"". But if you think about it, you don't want to have to do a production to get noticed. You want to just be yourself and have someone find it interesting and alluring. So for me personally, I have to let guys approach me. Apparently I'm intimidating so approaching men makes them nervous. So ask your friends what vibe you give off. It's not to care what other people think, but have an idea of if you should approach or wait to be approached. Men don't know you and operate off of vibes. So check your body language to see if it's inviting. Don't cross your arms, etc. Look up inviting body language.",1580515396

Anyways, I personally think part 2 (AKA the second half of TV season 1, with Joseph) and part 3 (TV seasons 2 and 3, with Jotaro) were the best parts, but part 1 (the first half of TV season 1, with Jonathan) is the only part that I'd consider significantly weaker than the others.",1580515396

Third, he would be responsible at all times for the care of the dog. I put my foot down about it and said I would no longer be helping once the baby was born because I would have my hands full. I also reminded him that the dog was not happy, and even though he liked having her, she would be much happier with a family that could devote the time and energy to her. I also reminded him that we could ask for an ""open adoption"" sort of thing where we could come visit her or get updates occasionally. This is what swayed him, I think. He came around to the fact that it was selfish to keep her but still not want to put any effort into her care. It did take awhile, though.

"muacjdiscussion","t5_342em","I have actually depotted all my palettes and have them in general colour families with complete eye looks of my own invention in each row.

So for example, for neutrals (or purples or pinks or warms or cools) I have a z-palette and each row in that Z-palette makes a complete eye look from inner corner colours, transition colours, lid colours (matte shimmer glitter), outer corner colours etc. About 10-12 shadows each row, including contrasting pops. I have a complete disregard for brands - it‚Äôs all about what works with each shadow‚Äôs undertones and prominent shimmers etc.

These palettes often get pulled out together and just like you do I will pick and choose elements from each palette if I am after something even more unique than I have already put together. Creativity is fun.

Having them in complete-eye-look-rows with several variations available in each row makes a grab and go day easy, with multiple variations to suit outfits. But it also saves me re-swatching to figure out undertones in shadows - you know, when a shadow actually looks completely different on the skin compared to its pan colour, like when a neutral-looking skin-tone shadow in a pan actually shows up purple or apricot on the skin.

By swatching them once and arranging them in similar colour families, I know they blend well together without having to think twice about it. If I want to do a cool + warm look (which I like to do), I know I need to be careful when grabbing a colour from a different palette and do minimal blending to retain the true colour.",1580515397

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A DPU (Defensoria P√∫blica da Uni√£o) pediu nesta sexta-feira (31) ao presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal, Dias Toffoli, a suspens√£o de [uma liminar concedida pelo ministro Luiz ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/fux-suspende-juiz-das-garantias-por-tempo-indeterminado.shtml)[Fux](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/fux-suspende-juiz-das-garantias-por-tempo-indeterminado.shtml) que adiou por tempo indeterminado a implanta√ß√£o do juiz das garantias.

 [A nova figura,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/lei-do-juiz-das-garantias-poe-em-xeque-poder-de-bretas-na-lava-jato-do-rio.shtml) criada pelo Congresso no pacote anticrime e sancionada em dezembro pelo presidente Jair Bolsonaro, era prevista na lei para entrar em vigor em 23 de janeiro.

 Respons√°vel pelo plant√£o do STF durante o recesso, Toffoli inicialmente [prorrogou o prazo de implanta√ß√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/toffoli-prorroga-em-6-meses-prazo-para-implantar-juiz-das-garantias.shtml) do juiz das garantias por seis meses (180 dias). Um dos argumentos √© que n√£o haveria tempo razo√°vel para o Judici√°rio se adaptar √† mudan√ßa, que afeta todo o sistema de Justi√ßa criminal.

 Na semana seguinte, Fux, que √© vice-presidente do tribunal, assumiu o plant√£o e revogou a decis√£o de Toffoli, suspendendo o juiz das garantias por prazo indeterminado. Fux √© o relator de quatro a√ß√µes que questionam a constitucionalidade [da nova figura.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/entenda-como-a-atuacao-de-moro-na-lava-jato-mudaria-com-o-juiz-das-garantias.shtml)

 O ministro deixou o plant√£o do STF na quarta-feira (29) sendo novamente substitu√≠do por Toffoli. Nesta tarde, a DPU ingressou com pedido de suspens√£o de liminar contra a decis√£o de Fux, abrindo a possibilidade de nova reviravolta.

 A pe√ßa √© assinada pelo defensor p√∫blico-geral federal, Gabriel Faria Oliveira, e pelo defensor p√∫blico federal Gustavo de Almeida Ribeiro.

  Fux tamb√©m havia barrado outro dispositivo do pacote anticrime que prev√™ a libera√ß√£o do preso que n√£o passar por audi√™ncia de cust√≥dia em um prazo de 24 horas. A DPU pede a Toffoli para suspender esse ponto da liminar de Fux, sob o argumento de que √© preciso evitar grave les√£o √† ordem.

 Pela nova lei, o juiz das garantias ser√° respons√°vel por acompanhar os inqu√©ritos, analisando pedidos de quebra de sigilo [e de pris√£o provis√≥ria,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/01/revisao-prevista-em-pacote-anticrime-pode-afetar-prisoes-sem-prazo-da-lava-jato.shtml) at√© o recebimento da den√∫ncia. Esse juiz n√£o poder√° atuar na fase posterior, da a√ß√£o penal.

 Desse modo, os processos criminais ficar√£o sob a responsabilidade de dois ju√≠zes, um que vai supervisionar a investiga√ß√£o (o juiz das garantias) e outro que vai julgar o acusado (o juiz de instru√ß√£o e julgamento). Defensores da cria√ß√£o da nova figura afirmam que ela ajudar√° a assegurar a imparcialidade das decis√µes do Judici√°rio.

 H√° um temor entre parte dos ministros do STF de que, com a decis√£o de Fux, o juiz das garantias n√£o saia do papel. Membros da corte e auxiliares lembram que Fux segurou por quatro anos uma s√©rie de liminares que garantia o pagamento de aux√≠lio-moradia a magistrados. O pr√≥prio ministro acabou revogando as decis√µes provis√≥rias, quando o Executivo deu reajuste ao Judici√°rio, em 2018, e o tema nunca foi discutido no plen√°rio.

 Por isso, h√° uma percep√ß√£o de que as quatro a√ß√µes sobre o juiz das garantias devem ir logo ao plen√°rio. Elas foram ajuizadas por associa√ß√µes de ju√≠zes e partidos pol√≠ticos que veem na medida afronta a princ√≠pios constitucionais, como o do juiz natural, e preveem que a exist√™ncia de dois ju√≠zes no processo dificultar√° o combate ao crime.

 Ao pedir a suspens√£o da liminar de Fux, a DPU argumenta que j√° houve decis√µes desse tipo antes, como quando Toffoli suspendeu uma liminar [do ministro Marco Aur√©lio,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/marco-aurelio-mello/) de dezembro de 2018, que havia determinado a soltura de condenados em segunda inst√¢ncia que j√° estivessem cumprindo pena.

 ""Portanto, n√£o se trata de inova√ß√£o a utiliza√ß√£o do presente meio para a suspens√£o de decis√£o gravosa √† seguran√ßa jur√≠dica do pa√≠s"", afirmou a Defensoria.

 ""Conforme estabelece a Lei 9.868/99, em seu artigo 10, cautelares em a√ß√µes diretas de inconstitucionalidade devem ser, como regra, decididas pelo colegiado [...] No caso em an√°lise, a Lei 13.964/19 [pacote anticrime] entrou em vigor em janeiro de 2020, durante as f√©rias coletivas do tribunal. Todavia, o que poderia ser considerado urgente e de dif√≠cil execu√ß√£o e implementa√ß√£o em curto per√≠odo j√° tinha sido analisado pelo ministro presidente [Toffoli]. A liminar concedida pelo ministro Dias Toffoli suspendeu a implanta√ß√£o do juiz de garantias por seis meses, tempo suficiente para a discuss√£o do tema pelo plen√°rio do STF"", disse a DPU.

 ""No que respeita aos demais fundamentos da decis√£o [de Fux] a ser suspensa, eles adentram no m√©rito do instituto, na sua adequa√ß√£o, aspecto que, uma vez afastada a urg√™ncia pelos seis meses at√© a implementa√ß√£o do juiz de garantias, deve ser debatido pelo colegiado.""

 A DPU afirmou tamb√©m que preocupa o fato de que ""decis√µes liminares t√™m sido mantidas por anos sem sua submiss√£o ao colegiado"".

 ""A Lei 13.964/19 alterou v√°rios dispositivos que ter√£o como consequ√™ncia direta o aumento do tempo em que o condenado passar√° enclausurado. Por outro lado, positivou a audi√™ncia de cust√≥dia, que pode ser um al√≠vio, ainda que parcial, nas pris√µes cautelares excessivas. Com a suspens√£o das audi√™ncias e o prolongamento das pris√µes, o sistema carcer√°rio, j√° abarrotado, poder√° ser ainda mais sobrecarregado, fazendo com que pessoas passem n√£o s√≥ mais tempo presas, mas mais tempo e em condi√ß√µes piores.""",1580515399

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt; It's not a matter of how good the computers are, or how well they are designed and tested. It's how well they function on garbage data, or with data they were never designed to collect.

Testing Avionics is literally my job. I spend my working life running tests on one particular set of avionics in one particular system (connected to a simulation of every other system) that is critical to the safety of one particular commercial airliner.

I maintain that you have zero understanding of the subject and are adding nothing to the conversation. You are suggesting that the entire world of software design within the aviation industry has not already foreseen the potential issue of a dodgy signal and prepared a countermeasure.

'Garbage Data' does not happen. You might lose a signal or get an intermittent signal if a data cable is damaged but you will not get 'Garbage data'. When a signal is erratic, frozen or 'out of range' there are very simple techniques to detect this that are already in use and have been since they first put cockpit display electronics on aircraft (not avionics, not computers, literally 1940's electronics)

&gt; A 17-year-old student pilot took off on a solo flight. Immediately after takeoff, she received a call on the radio indicating her fixed landing gear was damaged. There is no sensor for ""is my landing gear still welded to the plane"". None of her avionics indicated the failure. If this were the purely automated flight the parent comments are talking about, the computer would have killed the passengers by setting up for a normal landing. Instead, she walked away.

Firstly, How would you expect this problem to be solved by the removal of avionics? This does not support your argument.

Secondly there's literally cockpit indicators for landing gear position in all aircraft. Modern commercial airliners have a set of avionics specifically dedicated to the Landing gear and separate avionics for braking and steering. There is literally a fault message that reads 'Landing Gear Jammed Closed/Open'. I'll need a source before I believe this story and I fail to see how it's a programmers fault.

&gt; A commercial pilot taxied a transport aircraft to the ramp. Another pilot radioed him, indicating a maintenance panel was left open. Again, no sensor for this panel. No indication in the cockpit. No way for the computers to realize the problem. Another pilot prevented a serious incident that a computer would have allowed to occur.

How would you expect this problem to be solved by the removal of avionics? This does not support your argument.

This still isn't a programmers fault. You can't program a test for 'maintenance hatch open' if you don't have a sensor for it. You don't have a sensor unless there is a requirement that states 'there shall be a sensor to detect the position of Maintenance Hatch XX'. You don't have a requirement for that sensor unless it's determined that leaving that maintenance hatch open is a risk to the aircraft and I can promise you that the possibility of hatches being left open are taken into account during the fault tree analysis.

&gt; The MCAS debacle alone should prove to you that thousands of engineers, designers, and programmers working on a system for years can still fail, 

How would you expect this problem to be solved by the removal of avionics? This does not support your argument.

The MCAS debacle was caused by regulatory capture of the FAA by Boeing. They had hundreds of engineers complaining about issues with MCAS and were ignored because it would delay certification and cost money.
 
&gt; Humans may be the least reliable component in the system, but they are by far the most capable.

How did you write this sentence without coming to the conclusion that the unreliability of humans is the exact reason why we have automated as much of the pilots job as possible? Pilot error is the single biggest cause of Aviation disaster which is why the death rate in commercial aviation has fallen drastically as Avionics took over the entire job of the flight engineer and most of the job of the pilots.

A few thousand engineers working on avionics prevent a lot of issues caused by pilots. To date I am still testing software that was required to prevent Pilots doing stupid things.",1580515400

CoT Palpatine is solid, and I'd also advise Riskrunner.

You basically need to keep the streak going with a kill every 3 seconds. Because of that, you want to probably avoid trying on areas with split spawns where it's hard to sweep from one side to the other. You might also want to wait a second or two to let guys group. EDZ map is good. Mars is usually tough.

Aside from that, as others have suggested, you need to beat the rest of your team to the new spawn side, which is generally easy to figure out if you play enough gambit. Also, avoid spawns with big yellow bars, since they'll pretty much kill half a super and cause you to miss 3 seconds between kills.

Perseverance is probably the best thing you can do though. It's going to take a bunch of runs, and blueberries will screw things up, but eventually you chip away.

So basically you *may* not be able to just turn-key run the game (e.g. open Lutris, tell it to install, and good to go).  I can't recall if the current Lutris installer has a working version of Wine for LoL but I think it does.

Don‚Äôt tell them Who to vote for Please just get them to the booth. Using a mobile tool to verify your status is the easiest step I can think of then follow directions from there based on location.

My suggestion is using https://votesaveamerica.com/

You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we will probably mute you and move on with our day.

 A atua√ß√£o da MNTB √© objeto de pol√™micas e cr√≠ticas de indigenistas e antrop√≥logos 

 ""S√£o conhecidas as nefastas consequ√™ncias das atividades proselitistas sobre os povos ind√≠genas isolados em territ√≥rio brasileiro ao longo da hist√≥ria"", afirma a nota de rep√∫dio. ""H√° in√∫meras situa√ß√µes onde o contato for√ßado provocado por grupos mission√°rios, inclusive ligados √† MNTB, teve como r√°pida consequ√™ncia elevado n√∫mero de mortes por doen√ßas"".

 Na nota, a organiza√ß√£o sugere que a Funai busque, dentro da pr√≥pria Funda√ß√£o, quadros t√©cnicos competentes, com experi√™ncia de trabalho com povos isolados e capacidade t√©cnica.

  ""Denunciamos, mais uma vez, o r√°pido desmonte das pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas direcionadas aos povos ind√≠genas por parte do governo Bolsonaro, por meio da submiss√£o da pol√≠tica indigenista a interesses de grupos religiosos que d√£o suporte ao seu governo e, em muitos casos, a grupos ruralistas interessados pelas terras tradicionalmente ocupadas por esses povos"", diz o documento.",1580515404

Somehow his boyfriend thought I said I wanted to fuck him, which I replied with I do, because I do and he said he would kill me if me and my friend ever had sex. 

Fastforward and the boyfriend twisted it to make it look like I threatened him first and made my friend pissed at me by taking things out of context.

But basketball is after all a team game and in that context (which you'd think would be the only context) it's possible to be great without necessarily being a top dog. But what happens - most of the time in comparing players head to head we fall into the trap of imagining them playing 1v1. In that scenario it's hard to understand how Beal wouldn't be better than Lowry, or even a LaVine. But what about in terms of team basketball? That's where Kyle is capable of dominating a game without even scoring. I've seen it so many times. That 0 point game you mentioned? The Magic coach Steve Clifford was asked about that and he said he didn't even notice and that Kyle had a good game.

You can still get some light reflection with a bright white object against a black background, but nowhere near as bad as Oculus and no internal light reflections like the Index has.

Also agree what Pimax *hardware* doesn't get nearly enough praise. It's amazing that this little startup has managed to do something the giant corps like Facebook and Valve either can't or won't--push the envelope on FOV so that no other consumer-level HMD even comes close to what Pimax offers.

Because the people running the company are apparently more hardware focused--i.e. engineers--than they are ""running the company"" focused, the company gets a bad rep, and then lots of people start associating that bad rep with the hardware itself. Yes, I know there have been issues with hardware previously, but Pimax says they changed their manufacturing process and I believe it because there are ZERO cracks in my 5K XR--even after I smacked it pretty hard face first into a metal bar!

It's become ""accepted wisdom"" that Pimax is bad, even when it isn't. Not saying there's nothing wrong with the company or that people are wrong to be angry over poor customer service. Just that this isn't the whole story and there are people who've had very positive experiences with Pimax HMDs.",1580515406

&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. Senate voted 51-49 Friday night against allowing testimony from witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, making his acquittal in the chamber a virtual certainty and triggering outrage across the country.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;""We know these truths to be self evident: Trump is guilty and removal is our only option for dealing with dangerous leaders in power,"" said impeachment advocacy group By the People executive director Alexandra Flores-Quilty. ""Yet, Trump's defenders are saying that our Constitution does not apply to the powerful few.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""This is a crisis of democracy,"" Flores-Quilty added.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump was impeached by the House in December for an ultimately unsuccessful scheme to withhold military aid to pressure Urkainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce publicly he had launched an investigation into Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump's political rivals. Hunter Biden's employment by Ukrainian gas company Burisma would have been the focus of such an investigation.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;By voting down the possibility of hearing more testimony on the matter, the chamber's Republican leadership has effectively shut the door on removing the president for his involvement in the scandal. That, said¬†Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington executive director Noah Bookbinder, means the Senate has relinquished its oversight power.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This is a dereliction of duty and an abdication of constitutional responsibilities,"" said Bookbinder. ""51 senators voted to create a dangerous and embarrassing partisan precedent that will limit the functioning of our system of checks and balances going forward.""",1580515407

After changing my daily routines I noticed the nail fungus are no longer spreading (Both big toes infected, 3 other nails completely gone and the others superficially infected), so I hope that by clearing away the infected parts and keeping my daily routines will allow for a healthy nail to grow out.  
If anyones interested- my daily routine (more like some guidelines):  
\* Wash linnen, towels, socks and underwear at 90C  
\* Use bamboo socks (Antifungal properties and ventilation) and always apply some powder for sweat absorption before wearing socks. Change socks as often as you can if you cannot go bare foot.  
\* If you have the chance, go bare foot. I think this is the most crucial for stabilizing the environment. And as much sun on the feet as possible (unfortunately winter time but yeah)  
\* Wash feet and nails thoroughly daily without scrubbing too much, only dry superficially with a towel (It goes without saying use a separate towel for your feet). Dry nails with a hairdryer till they are completely dry after showering. Scrubbing can spread the fungal infections.  
\* Keep meticulous hygiene and cleanliness of floors in your place. Clean bathroom at least once a week with something that kills off fungi.",1580515408

For severe cases requiring hospitalization, supportive measures such as: IV fluids to maintain hydration; respiratory support (since this virus causes pneumonia); antibiotics if there are secondary bacterial infections; and other measures to minimize symptoms can help patients fight through the infection themselves.  

This can be very resource intensive though (especially if patients require mechanical ventilators; I don't know if this is common for this virus, just speaking in general), so efforts to prevent the spread of this virus is key so that hospitals aren't overloaded.

Yes, this is a sensitive subject for a lot of people. But not for what you described. This game - on some level - is basically about dealing with complexity. And that's a skill. Some people are good at it, but some aren't. If you're good at it you'll have a lot of fun in this game. But the worse you are, the more effort will it take. Cross some treshold, and you won't have fun while doing it. It's this simple. Most people just need a little bit of help or inspiration, or a good night's sleep if they encounter a roadblock. Some just can't be helped, because they don't really get engaged by the core gameplay loop itself enough, or at all. That's why some instantly and seemingly effortlessly get it, and that's why others struggle. The former can't really understand how the latter don't ""get it"", maybe fear that they want the game dumbed down, and the latter just feels stupid and quits.

&gt; I think that is very clear given all the posts on this sub-reddit asking basic questions or concepts.

No, it's not clear at all, because this isn't representative. No one makes a post, that ""hey, I just got these basic concepts by myself, see ya"", only those who need help. How do you infer the ratio of these people to the overall playerbase? Also, what other information have you tried to look at concerning this issue? Only those, that confirm your already existing view, right? :) For instance, how many people added Bob's mods to the game, for example? These are A) mods that *massively* increase complexity futher, and B) are consistently among the most downloaded mods to this game. What does that tell you?

And again, this is one of the most highly rated video game on the largest gamestore right now. If it were so horrible and unfriendly, it would show, don't you think? Maybe Factorio is just not a game for you. It's a game for us.

&gt; I think we could all agree there are at least a number of components that could be improved by improving the amount of information in the game for those that seek it.

Sure things can be improved! It's being improved all the time. It's just not clear to me that what extra information would you need (or did you need) to enjoy the game, or enjoy it better. What would statisfy you? The ingame tips good as a format? Are they enough? When you hover over a product the ingedient list is enough for you? Or you need detailed instructions, step by step, show you how to place object after object to do everything ingame? What are you arguing for?",1580515409

"AskGameMasters","t5_3986o","Wizards of the Coast got a program called [Guild Adept](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/news/guild-adept-program) where homebrew content posted on Dungeon Masters Guild is curated and exposed in a premium area as [top quality stuff](https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?filters=45680_0_0_0_0_0_0_0). That serves as stimuli for people to put their on ideas on game design and to propel marketing on that kind of material - though some of things I mentioned on the original post can be find for free: custom [Lingering Injuries](https://worldbuilderblog.me/2015/07/02/did-you-have-to-let-it-linger/) just like [Critical Hits](https://worldbuilderblog.me/2015/08/25/critical-hit-effects-table/) and [Fumbles](https://worldbuilderblog.me/2015/08/20/critical-failures/) can be found on  James Introcaso's blog; he's one of the authors of Xanathar's Lost Notes and the tables found in the book are mostly the same as those posted on his site. Homebrew classes on that book are very nice too, though I don't know where to find them for free.

The ""semi-official"" was labeled by me, since I have found that kind of material (curated by WotC themselves) has the same appeal of content like the Magic: the Gathering Plane Shifts for D&amp;D 5e (those are designed by a WotC employee but not officially published and allowed in Adventurers League events).",1580515409

"Stellaris","t5_39cuc","You could do the egalitarian one at the same time as the xenophile one. Fanatic xenophile/egalitarian. Fanatic xenophile will just make everyone like you. And if the console version is still pre-2.2, I assume they still have the species trait for +25 opinion, which should absolutely be used(I think it's charismatic, if that's still the case)

Sign migration treaties as much as you can. Do everything you possible can to get more aliens in your empire. Being a fanatic xenophile here is incredibly important as it means more empires automatically like you more, it's definitely the most important ethic for these achievements. And then just give every single one utopia living standards right there. There, you now have the migration treaties + Utopia living standard achievements done. And eventually you'll get omnicultural as well if you just give it enough time(make sure you're democratic just for the speedier elections). If I was going for this myself and wanted to continue playing, I would force close the game(before it saved but after getting the achievement) after getting Towards Utopia to avoid keeping everyone on utopia living standards. But that's up to you, of course.

I feel like xenophage wouldn't be ideal to get at the same time as battle thralls, since one is outright genocidal which gives an opinion malus, but I guess it's possible. If anything, the easiest way would be to set primitive civilizations on max and just enlighten them as you find them and then you get easy, primitive vassals. 

Xenophage itself will almost certainly require you to wage war in the later stage of the game, since you must have 5 species at the same time. Fanatic Purifiers would probably be my choice here. This is the one I would also go for Deus Vault as well(make sure you're the spiritualist version of fanatic purifiers obviously) although you should eventually be able to do this one with any build as long as it's not pacifist.

Keep in mind you can make these easier with the galaxy settings. For example, for the holy worlds achievement, you could disable all regular empires, enable fallen empires, and completely surround the spiritualist fallen empire when you find it. And then, at the same time, just colonize every single holy world. Boom, easy achievement. Similarly, this could be done with xenophage. Max out primitive civilizations, find 5 of them, invade them all at the same time. Make them all livestock and there you go, another achievement popped. The ability to change settings makes some of these very easy. Although to be clear, I play on the PC version and I'm also going by from what I remember was possible several patches back, so I'm not aware of all the smaller changes that the console version has in comparison.",1580515411

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Na d√©cada de 1960, propagandas circulavam em Belo Horizonte anunciando uma reforma urbana que abriria mais vias para os carros e aumentaria as obras de canaliza√ß√£o dos c√≥rregos e rios.

 Com o lan√ßamento do programa Nova BH 66, a popula√ß√£o ganhou a promessa de progresso e de sentir o cheiro bom do asfalto caminhando pela cidade, no lugar do cheiro ruim de pontos como o c√≥rrego do Leit√£o.

 Escondido h√° d√©cadas sob algumas das ruas principais da regi√£o centro-sul da capital, foi ele que [transbordou, arrastou carros e destruiu ruas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/os-carros-passavam-como-se-fossem-brinquedo-diz-moradora-de-bairro-atingido-por-enxurrada-em-bh.shtml) depois da chuva da √∫ltima ter√ßa-feira (28), invadindo o bairro de Lourdes com a correnteza.

 As [chuvas intensas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/bolsonaro-sobrevoa-cidades-atingidas-por-chuvas-em-mg-e-anuncia-r-1-bi-para-sudeste.shtml) da √∫ltima semana, que [deixaram 56 mortos em Minas Gerais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/homem-morto-pela-chuva-tentava-escoar-agua-de-dentro-de-casa-em-mg.shtml) ‚Äî13 s√≥ em Belo Horizonte, mostraram o limite do modelo que foi adotado desde a cria√ß√£o da cidade, para especialistas ouvidos pela **Folha**.

 As primeiras canaliza√ß√µes feitas em BH, no final da d√©cada de 1920, j√° trouxeram os primeiros transbordamentos da cidade, segundo o professor e ge√≥grafo Alessandro Borsagli, que estuda o tema h√° 10 anos.

  ‚Äú[A partir dos anos 1960], foi canaliza√ß√£o para todo lado. √â o mesmo modelo at√© hoje. Ligados √† canaliza√ß√£o e √† excessiva impermeabiliza√ß√£o, os transbordamentos come√ßaram a ficar mais frequentes e mais violentos‚Äù, afirma ele, autor do livro Rios invis√≠veis da metr√≥pole mineira (2018).

 Com o crescimento da cidade, o aumento de pavimenta√ß√£o e de telhados, deixou a √°gua sem local para cair e tendo que correr para os canais criados pelo homem, que aumentavam como um projeto de cidade.

 Capital jovem, fundada em 1897, depois da Proclama√ß√£o da Rep√∫blica, o local onde BH foi erguida foi escolhido justamente pelos recursos hidrogr√°ficos: com 12 cursos d‚Äô√°gua not√°veis, suficientes para abastecer uma popula√ß√£o pequena.

 O pecado original do projeto, diz Apolo Heringer, est√° justamente na planta da cidade, que n√£o priorizou a topografia, com serra, montanhas e rios, mas tentou copiar o que se via em cidades como Paris e Washington.

 ‚ÄúComo o rio faz curva, ele afrontava a consci√™ncia quadrada, a concep√ß√£o positivista do mundo, em que tudo pode ser dominado pela engenharia‚Äù, explica Heringer, m√©dico, ambientalista e criador do projeto Manuelz√£o.

 Na planta topogr√°fica de 1895, s√≥ o ribeir√£o Arrudas foi inserido na paisagem urbana de quarteir√µes e linhas retas, desconsiderando os demais cursos d‚Äô√°gua. Com o tempo, o pr√≥prio Arrudas foi quase totalmente confinado em canais pela cidade.

 ‚ÄúA preocupa√ß√£o era drenar. Voc√™ come√ßa a criar canais para n√£o inundar a rua e facilitar o escoamento mais r√°pido‚Äù, explica Heringer, que √© contra o modelo. 

 H√° 10 anos, vendo o esgotamento do canal a cada chuva, ele fez a previs√£o de que o Arrudas ainda iria explodir na Pra√ßa da Esta√ß√£o, no Centro.

 Uma das imagens que viralizou nas redes sociais no fim de semana mostra o mesmo Arrudas lan√ßando jatos d‚Äô√°gua, como um g√™iser, enquanto carros passam com pressa. 

 A prefeitura de Belo Horizonte diz que passou a reavaliar o uso da canaliza√ß√£o como solu√ß√£o para a cidade, depois das chuvas da √∫ltima semana. 

 Durante a semana, [a gest√£o Alexandre Kalil (PSD)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/e-o-maior-desastre-da-historia-de-bh-diz-prefeito-sobre-danos-das-chuvas.shtml) anunciou a suspens√£o da √∫nica licita√ß√£o de obra de canaliza√ß√£o em aberto, prevista para outro trecho do Arrudas, pr√≥ximo √† rodovi√°ria.

 As chuvas em janeiro em Belo Horizonte bateram uma marca hist√≥rica de 110 anos, segundo o Inmet (Instituto Nacional de Metereologia). O volume registrado - 935,2 mm - √© quase o triplo da m√©dia registrada no m√™s de janeiro nos √∫ltimos 30 anos, 329,1 mm.

 ‚Äú[Os desastres s√£o resultado] da quantidade excessiva de chuvas que caiu em curto espa√ßo de tempo, mas a culpa n√£o √© da chuva. A culpa √© da maneira que ocupamos o territ√≥rio‚Äù, diz Borsagli.

 As canaliza√ß√µes de rios e c√≥rregos vem de um modelo tradicional no s√©culo 19 e que persistiu, mas se tornou ultrapassado e pouco eficiente, pna avalia√ß√£o dos especialistas ouvidos pela reportagem.

 A solu√ß√£o, segundo eles, est√° em abandonar o sistema e fazer transi√ß√£o para parques ciliares que respeitem os cursos d‚Äô√°gua em seu leito natural. Algo que serviria tamb√©m para outras capitais brasileiras, como S√£o Paulo.

 ‚ÄúOutros pa√≠ses j√° come√ßaram a evitar a canaliza√ß√£o h√° mais tempo e buscam manter os cursos de √°gua em √°rea mais natural‚Äù, diz Nilo Nascimento, professor do departamento de engenharia hidr√°ulica e recursos h√≠dricos da UFMG.

 ‚Äú√â preciso agir no n√≠vel dos cursos de √°gua e da pr√≥pria bacia, uma a√ß√£o combinada‚Äù.

"MushroomGrowers","t5_37713","I am the r/MushroomGrowers AutoModerator. I'm kind of like [Heimdallr, the gate-keeper](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3640969.jpg) for this community. Your recent submission was bounced back by my filter for one of the following reasons:

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title.
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into easily-searchable categories and to filter out bots that would otherwise flood the community with spam. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you'll need to just copy/paste everything from before into a new submission, but this time type in a *properly formatted* and *correctly spelled* tag at the beginning of your title. A list of community-approved tags is as follows: ""*[gourmet], [medicinal], [actives], [general], [freebies], [trade], [technique], [contamination], [media], [article], [business], [now hiring],*"" or ""*[meet up].*"" Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting. You can also work off of the example listed below, typing in the tag that is most suited to your post topic:

&amp;nbsp;

""[You type the tag here between these brackets] A descriptive title for your post goes here outside the brackets"" which would look something like:

##""[General] This is my post about growing mushrooms""

&amp;nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines and rules on the sidebar (Rule 6 in particular) for more information. Please also note that the Mod Team is not able to edit titles, so you will have to make the changes to your title and repost it. Thanks for understanding!

I think what you're saying is more true in the opposite direction -- boomers dismissing all millennials or Gen Z-ers, which you understandably criticize. ""Ok Boomer"", instead of being a variant on this attitude, is a direct response to it: ""oh, my belief that we need comprehensive climate policy doesn't matter? Ok Boomer.""",1580515412

"clevercomebacks","t5_dyqlw","&gt; Says the person who spelled ""feminists"" wrong like three times.

Ah. The good ole, ""Ive run out of arguments, lets critique spelling!""

&gt; even the internet doesn't know the definition of feminism like you do.

If you dont trust me, how about a doctor of philosophy with a research focus on the relations between contemporary and 17-18th century feminism and general social philosiphy, Susan James?

&gt; Feminism is grounded on the belief that women are oppressed or disadvantaged by comparison with men, and that their oppression is in some way illegitimate or unjustified. Under the umbrella of this general characterization there are, however, many interpretations of women and their oppression, so that it is a mistake to think of feminism as a single philosophical doctrine, or as implying an agreed political program. (James 1998: 576)

Hell, just look at the women's liberation movement. the movement its self was undeniably femenist, but its also consisted of groups Ranging from the redstockings that viewed male homosexuality as inherently counter to equality because it excluded women to the lesbian spretism movement that largely viewed the only path to true equality was through the complete separation of women from the presence of men's domination. Are you going to say that because these fairly substantial parts of the movement dont fit the modern version of equality, the women's liberation movement was not a femenist movement?

&gt; Stop talking about what feminist or women think,when you clearly are none of them.

Lol. Yes. Because I think the co-opting of feminism by groups with skewed views of equality is a much larger hindrance to the movement as a whole than you seem to I cant possibly want equality.",1580515413

"atlanticdiscussions","t5_22ylrs","Well, I did it last night. I talked Miss Thing who tried to proposition Z. I went to her house on the pretense of getting back a book I loaned her. I _know_ I should‚Äôve taken the Mater route, just chalked the book up as a loss and said nothing (and Mater, you‚Äôre so lovely.) I could not do it, though. 

All I actually said to her was ‚Äúyou‚Äôd have better people around you if you were a better person‚Äù, but in a smug tone. I know you‚Äôll find this hard to picture (lol) but I have a _fantastic_ smug tone.

She tried to apologize as I was leaving, but I just walked to my car and ignored her. I can‚Äôt forgive someone I went out of my way to be nice to, and who used me as a crying shoulder, who then tried to f*ck my husband. Can not. Some things are too much. 

Z and I did have a good laugh about it last night, though. The pretense she made up to come over to our house before I was home was asking to borrow some lawn tools from us. He was knelt down coiling up a garden hose and asked her to get the weed eater. Then said ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs my leg. I said get the weed eater.‚Äù Then when she answered him to make her intentions clear, he just laughed out loud at her. Even in my angered state, that was hilarious to picture.

Having an issue with Windows Security/Defender not wanting to perform scans.

Whenever pressing to do a scan (whether quick scan or fullscan) it makes the animation of me clicking, but then nothing happens. No error messages, but the scan also doesn't actually start.

Previously had Avast installed, but used their uninstall utility from ( [https://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility](https://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility) ) to try and thoroughly get rid of any traces.

Have also tried using sfc /scannow via admin cmd prompt; but it said nothing was wrong.

When opening 'Windows Security' it shows green checkmarks for everything as if nothing is wrong.

Have also tried opening services.msc and then right clicking and restarting the one named 'Security Center' but the options are greyed out.

Then I tried opening task manager and going to services tab and restarting the wscsvc and while it allowed me to restart it that way; it still has not allowed me to be able to perform scans with windows defender.

Always wash ur nose by snorting water before sleeping, this prevents headache and makes it easier to sleep. 

Headache the day after ketamine is pretty common because it clogs ur sinusses which result in headache. After racemic ketamine I would always have headache the next day even if I injected the ketamine instead of snorting.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm specifically talking about commercially available probiotics that you could get off the shelf at your grocery store. Not that microbiome targeted therapies have no merit but that taking an over-the-counter probiotic or eating some bullshit ""probiotic yogurt"" is not going to do much in terms of health outcomes for most people.

Additionally, our knowledge of ""good"" bacteria and the therapeutic capabilities of them is still extremely limited. There are some well-established principles of the human gut microbiome but the science is far for being broadly actionable. (Braodly is key here as there are some very specific microbiome-targeted therapeutics already but it is extremely limited). Bacteria identified as being associated with specific beneficial health outcomes are not the species of bacteria in commercially available probiotics (which will largely be Bifidobacterium - generally only observed in high quantities in the guts of babies, people with C. dif infection, and some obese individuals and Lactobacillius).

It's expensive to go through the clinical trial process of an actually good probiotic. It's also complicated to patent a probiotic. People do not want to secure funding and go through the lengthly FDA approval process for if they have no way to make money after bringing the probiotic to market. I'm not condoning or condeming that system it's just how it is.

Fecal transplants are a whole other beast and are only approved for recurrent C. diff infection (after 1-3 failed abx regimens depending on hospital/insurance policy). The science is still not clear on exactly why fecal transplants work so well for C. diff either. It's definitely an evolving science but it's far from braod therapeutic applications just yet.

&gt;""It's not pessimistic to me. Tragedy is not pessimistic,"" [Jake Elliott] said. ""A lot of literary tragedies or dramatic tragedies, at the end the character who has made all these terrible mistakes or who has these terrible flaws... they usually have this moment where they sort of take responsibility for it, or in some other way transcend it. Spiritually, at least. Like Oedipus has this horrible disfiguration in the end, but he does it in order to sort of reconcile himself with fate, which was his mistake to start with.""

&gt;""Similarly in¬†*Kentucky Route Zero*, the characters are put in these terrible positions,"" Elliott said. ""Conway gives himself over to this debt situation. But he's also done something really good, because this community has formed around him, and then he's moved himself out of the way in order for this community to thrive.

If all these dots are checked, I wouldn't worry about it at all- A lot of the problems with Aluminum came from improper installation and old age without proper maintenance- For a new install, with proper care, I would forget about it and live my life, don't worry about the wires in your house.

You haven't lost anything. Remember who you were before you met and who they wanted to be. That's the person you should be giving your time and attention to. 

Instead of measuring the distance between you and them, measure the distance between who you are and who you want to be. Keep a progress journal, actually try doing one of those things you never had time for. 

As someone who spends time talking to the elderly, many of them actually look back fondly on times like this. These moments, horrible as they are, can open new doors you didn't know you had. 

You don't see it now, but you have been freed of the worst kinds of burden in life. You can't make someone happy who is incapable of contentment.

You are not lost, if you open your heart you can embark on the greatest odyssey of your life. If you are open to it, you may find the journey to be more rewarding than any relationship you have known.

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","I started dyeing mine about 3 months ahead. I left them alone for a while and just let them dry. At about 2 months ahead, I stemmed each of them. I was doing them in batches at night. That took me about a week or two. I played around with them a bit after that, doing a couple test bouquets and changing up my fillers until I was happy. I did end up ordering more after I stemmed them because I didn't think I'd have enough. I had dyed all of my first batch and left the new ones natural for a little contrast. I'm happy I did that, it made the colors pop more. 

About a month ahead, I started doing a bouquet every couple of nights. I had 3 mini's, 2 smaller, 5 medium-largish, and mine. I also did 11 boutonnieres and 3 corsages. I finished about 2 weeks before. I waited a little longer than I should have, but I still had plenty of time. 

I did it all myself, with the exception of one of my bridesmaids helping me wrap them. 

The only part that I had difficulty with was getting them dyed the exact color I wanted. I did a lot of experiments. Buy extra for that purpose. 

I changed the filler I used a few times too. I originally was going to use fake greens, but it looked bad. I ended up dyeing some of the flowers green instead to get that color in there. My final fillers were little furry cattails, some gold swirly sticks, and glittery baby's breath that I ordered from Sola Wood Flowers. It was a fall wedding, so that worked so well.",1580515417

Those might not be physical support groups, but its first step in finding community of people who went though the same thing you have.

I wouldved loved to read or watch a YouTube video, and relate. And know that its real. And not just me.

Id honestly like if the non gifted side got more intrest from the public. Maybe teachers and guidance counselors would not be so shitty towards kids like me. 

More intrest would mean people would learn that yes, this side exist. And maybe we would some support and sympathy from people. 

Its not much, but years ago, that wouldve been life saving.

 I was gonna add that I wasnt directing the anger at you specifically. More like at the community + people in general.

Title: **Unsure how to proceed regarding car damage I caused**

Original Post: 

&gt; Okay, so I hit a parked car and scratched the paint, no dents or anything. I left a note with my number, offered to pay, and asked if she would be willing to keep insurance out of it. She told me that ""the thing is"" she would need a rental while the estimate and work is done.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this normal? I've never done anything like this. I'm under 25 and just got car insurance a MONTH ago so I'm really nervous about what it will do to my rate. I'm also on my dad's insurance, would it raise his rates too? 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I don't know where else to do it and I'm really freaked out

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"ireland","t5_2qhb9","Sure, you might think the left don't have realistic chances of election more than one candidate in a constituency, but if the left want to be in any way relevant then they better fucking put the work in and start having a realistic chance of doing so.

You're acting as if we live in the fucking UK with their tactical voting nonsense, we have a sensible voting system that can support multiple similar candidates, you talking about ""votes to spare"" makes me genuinely think you must be a brit who is entirely unfamilar with how our system works.

You're not describing how to get the left in power any time before 2050 if you're gonna be that overly cautious, and what you're suggesting would also be completely unworkable since it would just cause massive fucking arguments over which party gets to be the single left wing candidate in a constituency.

Yes, it will be very difficult to start getting multiple left wing candidates elected in each constituency, but the first step is having them run, and the second step is putting in massive amounts of work to get them each elected. 

If they can't do that, and overcome the problems it presents, then it's game over and there's no point even discussing getting the left in power. Yes it will be difficult, winning an election generally is.

You're suggesting not even trying. I'm genuinely wondering if you're some FF/FG fan trying to convince the left to neuter itself",1580515419

"theHunter","t5_2tx8d","Well, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest it as a ranged weapon.  It isn‚Äôt.  Depending on the slug, barrel, etc. it‚Äôs more than possible.  Certainly, dangerous to take a shot within 30 meters for the hunter of big game but that‚Äôs what makes it fun, and we are talking about a game.  Really, bows and crossbows fit the same profile (within game), not many would risk a single bow shot on big game.  One of the reasons many big game rifles are double barreled is that ability for an immediate follow up in a life or death situation.  But, overall, it‚Äôs not an IRL argument, just look at what we have now in terms of coverage.  It‚Äôs a game, so my thoughts are primarily at adding more to the game.

If you can get two clean slug shots off on dangerous game within 40-25 meters in COTW, you should be able to collect your trophy animal.  Bows exist in a similar way within the game and I love that variety that they add.  I would never argue limiting bows or crossbows.  Allowing ‚Äúshotguns‚Äù to fill the range of classes is worth it simply for the sake of bringing more variety in hunts.  Just like bows/crossbows, it would be nice to have another single weapon loadout to walk a map with.  Certainly doesn‚Äôt make it any easier than spotting game 200+ meters out and plunking it one time in the lung before it has a chance to see/smell you for sure.  Shotguns, like bows and even pistols, require you to get closer which means you may lose your chance for a variety of reasons, and with shotguns, once you get close, you have to wait for that broadside shot (at least you used to and hopefully still will).  Additionally, adding big game to shotguns makes the ‚Äúbang stick‚Äù skill a possible draw for not only spending the skill point but also carrying the double barrel shotguns as well, almost the equivalent of a 600g bow shot.

I‚Äôve never seen why anyone would argue against this.  It‚Äôs certainly not OP, and not going to lead to sudden widespread shotgun use.  But, it might allow people to pick up their shotguns a little more and hunt a bit, with a slightly different strategy, rather than just stalking needzones from 200 plus meters out (not that there is anything wrong with that).   Variety adds more hunting possibilities to the game.  I would think most players would be all for it.",1580515421

"politics","t5_2cneq","You seem a little unclear on the details about what Snowden, Greenwald, and other journalists attempted to work out for asylum and the efforts of the US to make that impossible. I suppose they were all chinese and Russian assets who continue to cover for Snowden to this day. I suppose the Guardian is actually a  foreign tool used for spying and espionage as well.

If the US didn't want Snowden to stay in Russia where he might be pressured to give up state secrets ( which is at least plausible on the face of it) , they shouldn't have taken steps to make sure he was stuck there.  That story is public record.

If you have seen  even an ounce of evidence that Snowden traded any state  secrets for asylum with China or anyone else then go ahead and provide the relevant sources, and documents.

Unless I see something like that (and I never have from any source) I am going to go ahead and assume you are simply repeating   the usual talking points that I have come to expect on this subject from US govt and their media mouthpieces.

If Snowden had been motivated by base motives of self interest, there are a whole bunch of better ways to pursue them within the US intelligence agencies. Isn't this a simple and obvious fact.

 The story against Snowden has never stood up to  a critical assessment of plausible motives and evidence. It's all hearsay and conjecture from partisans and adversaries.",1580515422

For a test, open up your phone's wifi options and look at the signals around you - quite often, you'll see a dozen or more wifi networks of at least 2 bars. Your neighbour's routers are behind those same wall/floor materials.

Its not the two states that matter so much as population centers.

After the last patch there's been an increase in odd behavior but nothing really noteworthy. Sometimes it has an hiccup and the tank keeps moving for a few meters, or the trigger won't fire instantly but again, those are uncommon enough to be an unpleasant surprise rather than a worry. Like, today I played 17 battles and in once the gun took a fraction of a second to fire, another time the tank kept steering for maybe a second or two, and once I got flashbacks of when spotting lots of reds would cause a brief lag spike.

Now realistically speaking both PS4 and Xboxes run on the same server hardware, just with different settings or something, right? So my theory is that the EU data center happens to be better for whatever reason. Maybe it's just cheaper and as a result the NA one is a little low on resources, maybe I'm completely off the mark.",1580515424

Then goes on to say $0 taxes paid by amazon.. IF htey paid 0 in taxes you can't discount that, so the only cost would have been an upfront 600 mil grant that was able to be crawled back based on jobs/revenue/tax projections......

ANyway:



""The Urban Institute, a center-left think tank highly respected among Democrats, is projecting that a plan similar to what Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders are pushing would require $34 trillion in additional federal spending over its first decade in operation""

For example, economist Kenneth Thorpe estimated that single-payer health care would cost the federal government $24.7 trillion through 2026, excluding the costs associated with long-term care benefits (likely about $3 trillion). The Urban Institute estimated a $32 trillion cost over the same period, including those long-term care benefits. The Center for Health and Economy (H&amp;E) produced an estimate that the American Action Forum calculates would cost the federal government $36 trillion through 2029

Green new deal has many aspects that are unrealistic

-100% electric transport by 2030 - yeah the average car life cycle is 15 years, and there are a ton of trucks on the road - not realistic..  what about cargo ships? Especially if nuclear is a 'false renewable'?

- wind farms take up a TON of land : amont of energy, and use a TON of coal to maek steel and concrete. If you tax fossil fuels building them gets a LOT more expensive

- fertilizers come from fossil fuel byproducts

- plastics come from petrochemicals

-prevent new micro - nuclear plants from being built?





""The 281 million cars, trucks, motorcycles and other vehicles that now travel U.S. roads would be useless without gasoline and diesel fuel, with the exception of the few that are electric vehicles.

Sanders proposes spending $2.2 trillion ‚Äì which would have to come from your tax dollars ‚Äì to help Americans buy electric vehicles (EVs). Last year Americans purchased about 400,000 EVs. That same year we purchased 17 million conventional vehicles.""



___________________________

more relaistic options:

Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, thinks it‚Äôs entirely possible to get to net zero by 2050 by spending around 2 percent of GDP each year, or around $18 trillion in total.

‚Äú$18 trillion is real money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut when you spread it out over 30 years, it‚Äôs entirely feasible and it will have a lot of economic benefits in addition to getting us down to zero emissions.‚Äù



Pollin, however, strongly disagrees with the resolution‚Äôs aim of getting to net zero with just a decade of investment.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs completely unrealistic and it‚Äôs not worth costing out,‚Äù he said of the Green New Deal.

Edward Barbier, an economist at Colorado State University, agrees that a strict timeline isn‚Äôt realistic. He advocates jump-starting the transition by investing about 5 percent of GDP over five or so years. GDP was $20.5 trillion in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, so that‚Äôs a little over $1 trillion a year.

‚ÄúThat would push us on a path to clean energy, and a path that permanently lowers carbon emissions,‚Äù he told us.",1580515427

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","I mean this in the most gentle way possible when I say that expressing suicidal thoughts to your friends is going to do nothing but drive them away, because that's way, way above a friend's pay grade.  I know you don't mean to do that, and you're just looking for some comfort or reassurance, but friends are not professional therapists and usually don't know what to say.  This is especially true if you do it a lot (and hardly ever talk about other topics) and doubly true if you are phrasing it in a way that puts the onus on them to keep you from carrying through.

It turns into a vicious cycle, where you try to solicit reassurance, and your friends, not knowing what to do with this super-heavy burden you're putting on them, edge away from you, so you need more reassurance, and repeat until your friends are just memories.

You need professional help.  Please contact a suicide hotline when you have these kinds of thoughts, or go to the ER.  For the long-term, you need a therapist to talk this kind of thing out.  Friends are not replacements for professional help.  Please get the help you need, and stop putting this onto your friends.",1580515427

"comics","t5_2qh0s","I think the real issue is simply that modern Americans (and Westerners and the English speaking countries etc.) generally eat a diet hard on the digestive system with meat every meal, lots of refined sugars, lots of other heavily processed ingredients, lots of fried stuff and other non-beneficial oils, dairy from cow milk, huge portions (often all you can eat), not to mention the ratio of Westerners who are obese. Our ancestors wouldn't have had so much meat and heavily processed stuff, no refined sugars, and fewer calories available for most people.

So our modern diet probably puts some new stresses on health, such as sometimes losing the ability to digest everything in a timely manner and get it out of your system without doing things like drinking coffee or taking laxatives.

I'm over 50 and had constant digestive problems all through my 40s. Then I changed my diet (mostly vegetables, rice, beans, and some fish, few sugars), lost weight, and did regular enemas for a while when it was really bad, and I'm totally fine now. Usually I wake up in the morning needing to go, before my morning coffee which is I drink mainly for the caffeine (caffeine is addictive so unless they drink decaf, all coffee drinkers drink it for the caffeine more or less).",1580515429

If you add too much beans too quick, you will feel quite bloated. You have to slowly add them to your diet over about a month. Like I started with just 2 tablespoons a day and increased. Just aim granola bars or oatmeal breakfasts and peanut butter jelly sandwiches at lunch, and add tofu to stir fry for dinner and things like that for the first month.

I knew a bunch of people whose families spoke to them in their heritage language, but they could barely speak to their families in said language (though they could speak).  Certainly they have an advantage learning the language, and of course all that input will make the output easier, but to speak a language *well* after *only* learning from input (as opposed to *primarily* from input)?  I'm skeptical.

The writing system would also make a difference too.  For example, one of my neighbors grew up in Hong Kong in the 80s.  He reads periodicals in Mandarin regularly.  He watches tv shows from mainland China (which are in Mandarin).  He can't speak it.

I imagine phonology would also play a factor as well as to how much one could learn to speak just through input.

Some are better at each of these than others, which acts to explain the gameplay mechanic of having dragons at different levels.

As for lady-dragons, those do exist, and they're called the Jills.

"BokuNoHeroAcademia","t5_34a0h","One thing you aren't realizing is that Shouto isn't as skilled or intelligent as Bakugou or Midoriya. The power of someone's quirk isn't the deciding factor in how strong they are. Bakugou has the most versatile quirk out of the big 3 of 1-A which gives him flight, various ranges, mobility, extreme speed augmentation, acrobatic augmentation, AoE, being able to do things like blind foes,and ridiculously strong attacks. Shouto can just shoot walls of ice and fire, having limited uses compared to Bakugou with his quirk. Not only does Bakugou have a better quirk, but he's shown to be much more intelligent and a much more effective leader figure in a team (refer to the JTA arc or internship arc for examples). 

Overall, Shouto isn't cuffed for his power, he's simply not as honed outside of the concept of not using his quirk, or at least using his quirk to assist himself and other people rather than use it directly for every situation. 

Finally, Bakugou also has a lot of potential. He could end up hitting nuclear level in his prime and be casual mach speed. He could also have a quirk evolution that allows him to produce his sweat anywhere, making him even more lethal, or be able to create different types of explosions, not to mention he could learn how to utilize the shockwaves of his explosions which could rupture organs. Shouto was supposed to be a wake up call for Bakugou and an obstacle for Midoriya, he serves as a scale that they have to measure up to, and they're currently exceeding him, so the roles are reversed.",1580515432

Pull together a set of policy questions from economists, political scientists, journalists, and some from individuals in various industries or walks of life. Poll people to sort them by popular importance. All the candidates are then invited to release a youtube video discussing that issue, as well as one followup responding to issues raised by other candidates.

Agree to post the videos in the same channel if they meet certain criteria: are judged to answer that question or respond to points raised by another candidate and are under 5 minutes.

Any candidates can reply, but an answer will have to be meaningful to stand out from the noise.

As for TV debates, we wouldn't have to get rid of them, just not rely on them quite so much. I like seeing candidates try to think on their feet and all, but it would be really good to hear them actually dig in on specific policies, and not just trading 15 second bumper stickers.

Aren't *some* handcuffs justified? Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using nuclear bombs in conflict. ""We have them, why shouldn't we use them?"" A paraphrase, but fairly accurate.

Why not? Because it would lay waste to huge areas and release large amounts of radiation that could ultimately float through the atmosphere and end up causing problems and diseases in nations far afield, including the USA.

The same can be said for many of the chemical and bio weapons discussed here. No later good can come from lands wasted by nuclear, chemical, or biological agents. The land will recover, eventually, of course. But Europe is still digging up chemical weapons from WWI, a hundred years later.

For the good of all humans, I believe we should limit ourselves to weapons that do not guarantee long term pollution of the places we live.

I am against war entirely, in every manner, but if our leaders choose to conduct wars, I think it should be with those thoughts in mind.",1580515433

I have friends raising kids on less blue states that things are cheaper, of course they have other lacks like less jobs opportunities and less pay, but they network with willing family and friends try to ask for that on a blue states and half your ""friends"" will disappear within a week. Everyone here expect you to have it all before you have kids or else is your own fault, abortion is legal and there is a PP in every corner so is not like you had no choice but to have your baby.

"Cigarettes","t5_2qjd2","I probably must be one of the lucky ones, since I have managed to keep my same low amount of smoking all these years later.

I have no doubt that as of late, I've been smoking even less as of late.

To me, I more just see this issue, as yourself being successful in fighting off the urges to want to smoke, when you get those cravings. Of course, there are times when I can't help but want to smoke a few, especially lol when I drink. I don't doubt for other people, that they may find addiction harder to fight, and be more likely to greatly up their amount of smoking right after trying smoking.",1580515433

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

I'm not sure I could have confidently guessed that you were German if I hadn't known before. There are some parts that might have made me think you're German but overall, your accent isn't thick at all I think.

While I don't think your pronunciation was wrong at any point, I do think it was inconsistent.
I would recommend choosing one of the native accents and sticking with it since your accent is still quite mixed. You pronounced many things the way a British person would, e.g. ""mathemaTics"" with a hard T instead of a d. On the other hand, you pronounced ""society"" the way an American would; ""socieDy"".

Once you've chosen a native accent, try to also mimic their prosody. Doing that will help you hide your German accent and also be more intelligible. When watching a TV series, try to pay a lot of attention to their pitch accent and rhythm. Try out shadowing exactly what they say exactly how they say it and don't be afraid to sound stupid. Try to be as truthful to the native speaker as possible.",1580515435

Some people make rituals out of working out, or pretty much anything really is just that Wiccan rituals are already written, and you can focus your energy on the specific thing it's about- feeling better, getting the promotion you want, or any number of things. Even just meditating on something you want to happen can be good. 

Personally I follow a lot of the Nordic mythology for my Wicca but it's mainly because I hail from Ireland, Poland, and Germany in my family so it makes sense for me.

If he is making less then what was stated the banks could decide to raise his interest rate which would cause the payments to go up. 

The dealership wants him to bring his paystubs so that they can send it into the bank to show his earnings and the bank can adjust his interest rate accordingly. If he said he was making more then what he actually is then his interest rate could go up, and vice versa. 

It's weird that they are doing it after the fact, but it is most likely because the dealership submitted the information, and the bank wanted some proof of earnings. This has happened a couple times before at our dealership.

The used car dealership has no control over the interest rate, that is all to do with the banks. If they try to raise your interest rate try to contact your personal bank and see if they will finance you at a lower rate.",1580515438

There is a reason that Warren Buffett doesn't really consider himself a pure value investor anymore, and has not for some time. It just doesn't work like it used to.

"RWBYcritics","t5_wuw08","Don't agree with the conclusion. The conflict with Ironwood in volume 7 is loyalty vs. trust. And it say RWBY did nothing for Ironwood is bizarrely inaccurate, since most of the volume they volunteered their services in seeing his plan to fruition. You also attempt to paint Ironwood's actions as far more benevolent then they are. 

**Dance Dance Infiltration (Ruby)**

The events are laid out to paint Ruby as deceptive and Ironwood as rational and good natured. Neither is correct in my opinion. 

Ironwood's first action is to detain Ruby until witnesses and cameras are reviewed. As would be the protocol. After review he agrees with Ruby's actions - she was obviously trying to help. He doesn't mean he's endeared to her, just that he approves of those particular actions. It's not as a big deal as you lay it out. 

Ruby doesn't respond with deception either - she points them in the right direction. The one bit of solid information she knows is the White Fang is operating out of southeast Vale. The only bit she hides is how she knew, to protect her and her team since their actions weren't officially sanctioned. Ozpin is not an idiot and quickly realizes there is more to it but knows the directions are not a lie. Hence a discrete recon mission being set up which RWBY later joins. Ironwood remains silent on the quality of the information in this scene.

You did edit this comment to correct the the misdirection part, but you're still hanging onto it being a deception. The additional details don't help them find the exact location of the base. It would antagonize Ironwood though - the General wouldn't be pleased on hearing about the first year student's activities. The appropriate response from his character would be to punish them. And if the truth is so important here, then what about Ozpin and Ironwood hiding what they know? That this not just a White Fang operation as it appears on the surface. Ironwood makes no attempt to tell the truth, why does he get a pass?

You also twist the information in the next scene. It's Ironwood and Glenda that are arguing over the next move. Glenda wants discretion, Ironwood wants to throw a ton of soldiers at it. Ozpin sides with Glenda and then reasons with Ironwood that it's the best move ""You're a general, James. So tell me, when you prepare to go to war, which do you send in first? The flag bearers, or the scouts?"" Ironwood is not a cool, calm voice of reason in this scene, far from it - he even irrationally accuses Ozpin of wanting to do nothing. This is one the earlier moments where we see the flaws in Ironwood's character. 

Overall this doesn't set the tone between Ironwood and Ruby since this meeting is based around circumstances. There's no relationship either - neither is seeking to utilize or rely on the other. Ruby is outsider to Ironwoods perspective, not an ally or even a potential ally at this stage. She's kid who showed some initiative, and there's no evidence to suggest he thinks otherwise.

**Fall** 

Agreed here, it's just a summary of the events. Ironwood was acting in his official role here, nothing more.

**Attack on Beacon**

Ironwood gives the students the option of fighting or leaving, noting that no one would fault them for leaving. Nothing unreasonable. 

**V4** 

Ironwood sending Yang a replacement arm is understandable - he knows her uncle and her father, so him receiving word of Yang's injury wouldn't be unusual. Regardless of family connections, his motivation to help those injured in the attacks makes sense, since it happened under his watch. Regardless of fault, I can see Ironwood blaming himself and wanting to make amends. I don't agree with the notion that Yang owes him one though. This was an act of charity with no strings attached. And Ironwood was not looking for praise or thought of it as a debt to be repaid by Yang. 

Ironwood offering Weiss a place at Atlas Academy fits the same motivations behind sending an arm to Yang. Plus she has potential of being an excellent huntress like her sister. Him siding with Weiss at the ball is not despite the fact she almost killed someone - it's easy to observe her summoning was unintentionally caused by her distress. Ironwood relates to her position, since he has to deal with these attitudes daily. 

Ironwood shows responsibility in these interactions, and it's not entirely unrelated to his current issues. It's not a huge effort on his part either - he didn't build the arm, and helping Weiss cost him nothing. Nor does he go out of his way to do so. To suggest it's a monumental effort on his part doesn't ring true.

**As they travel**

This section isn't accurate.

First thing Qrow does is send a letter to Ironwood to advise him he's on his way. He may not see eye to eye with Ironwood, but he trusts him. Ren comments on the closed borders but makes no mention of the morality of it. It's also Qrow's plan to head to Argus and seek access to Atlas through the military there. When they get there he name drops to no avail. When Cordovin confronts them Ruby points out she doesn't hold Atlas responsible for the attack. Weiss mentions no one is happy with the embargo, but understands Ironwood's motives ""... but I know General Ironwood is just worried."" 

I can't find a scene in volume 6 where they disparage Ironwood or voice mistrust - it seems to be the opposite. Qrow shows faith in him, Ruby doesn't blame him, and Weiss understands his position. Their main motivation is to get to him. When Cordovin presents herself as an obstacle, they plan to steal an airship to get everyone there. It's not to spite Ironwood in any way, it's to keep them together.

At the start of volume 7 Weiss points out that security won't let them near Ironwood after landing in a stolen ship. They may even escort her back to father. She does not say it would be on Ironwood's orders. Her idea is to contact her sister and seek a path to Ironwood that way. Ruby and Yang are sadden to see a disheveled Ironwood. They get a better picture of what's going on through observing Mantle, and it's not great. So Qrow opts for caution until they sniff out the situation. Which is not unreasonable, as the doubt is not unfounded. And the plan is still to meet with Ironwood at some point.

**V7**

Meeting with Ironwood: A group of Huntsmen and Huntresses fully clued in to Salem fell into Ironwood's lap. His option is to use this resource or put them aside - he picks the smarter choice. Laying out his plans is a means to this end. Handing the relic back is not a matter of trust - he's just unaware of it's real purpose, and that there's a question left. 

Ruby hiding information: First off, trust is not brought. They don't owe it him because he gave them things and position in his plan. They're willing to work for him though. RWBY was nothing but supportive of his plan in the first half of the volume. Ruby also doubts her decision to keep the facts hidden, but the plan was to tell him at some point. 

Ironwood and Ozpin: To Ironwood, Ozpin is a valuable source of information in the fight against Salem. He knows about the relics and their uses for example. He can also offer advice to Ironwood, and help confirm if Ironwood is doing the right thing. Currently he's shouldered all responsibility, Ozpin could help lighten that load. And he seems to be the only one he trusts to do so. Ironwood doesn't pick trustworthy allies, he picks loyal soldiers in Ace-ops, Winter, and Penny.

Upgrades and Licenses: Giving them equipment and resources is not an act of generosity. He's outfitting them to his standards *after* they agree to help. As Winter says; ""Remember, this is Atlas. While assisting the military, we will provide you with the best equipment our scientists can devise."" Same with the licenses - it'll be unusual for Ironwood to use a bunch of trainees unconnected to the academy for real missions. It would draw suspicions. Ultimately, RWBY work for him now. Trust is not Ironwood's primary motivation here.

Forming doubts: RWBY are not soldiers. Voicing opinions and doubts is not something they see as a restriction. They have misgivings over Ironwood's priorities, which is natural. There is a cost in diverting resources solely to the Arena project. Opinions are going to be divided. Ren supports the project and thinks it's necessary, Nora objects to putting people at risk. Blake and Yang think the Robyn should be in the know to reach a compromise. They're individuals not blind followers.

**The issue with the narrative**

Overall it's not about trust, it's about loyalty. Trust is not brought through the things his gives them, it relies on integrity of character. And there is trust given by RWBY - they volunteer their services and get behind his plan. That's not nothing as you propose.

When Ironwood opens up to the council then Ruby fully puts her trust into him. That when he decides to reveal the truth, she follows suit. They don't joke and high-five afterwards - Ruby and Oscar's last interaction is before this happens.

Ironwood is not a benevolent father figure towards RWBY, he's their General first and foremost in this season. He's doesn't seek their council, he expects their loyalty. And if there's a choice between the safety of Atlas and the safety of RWBY, he's going to choose Atlas.

So when RWBY protested against his plan, they become an obstacle in his eyes because they were no longer loyal. In RWBY's eyes he broke their trust. Until that moment they still supported him and largely backed his actions, especially after his change of stance with the Council and Robyn. That's the clash of ideals - Ironwood looked for loyalty, RWBY looked for trust. Both ended up disappointed.",1580515440

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;I'm ambivalent towards MensLib. In one hand it attempts to be a positive space and is good at keeping hate at bay, but on the other hand it has a built-in refusal to acknowledge that sometimes men get the short end of the stick without fault of their own. 

Fair. I don't think they are entirely without merit. I do like some of what they say. I just don't like the main driver of their perspective. And feminism as a driver of their perspective does lead them to some silly conclusions about gender and gender relations, much like you have eluded to. I appreciate what they try and do though from the perspective of getting men to not just see one way to be a man etc

&gt;I personally think both MensLib and MensRights have their own merit and are good space for their own perspectives and conversations.

Agreed.

&gt;On the other hand, MGTOW is downright toxic. The concept is great but it has absolutely nothing to do with the execution.

I guess I partially agree. While there was some toxicity there. I've lurked there for the past 6 months or so and I didn't see it as as bad as people are saying it was. Maybe I just didn't delve far enough?",1580515440

&gt;It's not about age or seniority. But giving a Ward a leadership role for a time is Armsmaster's own approach, and failing anything else, a Ward with experience &amp; age is going to get their turn, even if it's a short one. Gives the PRT leadership of Brockton Bay (Armsmaster, MM, Piggot) a chance to assess their skills.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sophia wouldn't ever get a leadership role in the Wards, as she remains a probationary ward until she turns 18. See PRT quest details for more on the PRT approach to this stuff. This means, also, that Sophia doesn't have access to confidential files, and there's a PRT officer working with her at all times (seen in the school meeting).

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Well, MDMA can make you sweat/overheat which was aggravated by the anxiety so in my case, I was sweating, felt that sinking pit in my stomach, and my head was a little fuzzy from the onset of the effects and all the people bumping into me making me wobble. I started to worry. But my friend was very experienced and got me water and took me to a quieter room of the venue where I could sit down, cool off, no flashing lights, and just talk about how I felt. Within 5 minutes I was totally fine, went back to the show, and my roll (all the euphoria/bliss/energy) kicked in about 10 minutes later. 

So really, if you feel panic/anxiety coming on you can always try sitting down/resting and talking through it because it really does help.

It is also rare for Babymetal songs to have any romantic overtures and this is definitely one of them.

Some anime are just natural fits for certain Babymetal songs. Just like [The Garden of Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words) is for No Rain No Rainbow. The story of a forbidden love/infatuation between a 15 year old and a teacher (not his teacher!) told beautifully by the incomparable [Makoto Shinkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai) provides a gorgeous backdrop for the song. 

The fact that the short movie features many scenes of raining, clear skies, forlorn glances, beautiful scenery was not lost on me when I selected this anime for the song. The fact that the song was initially called ‚ÄòEndless Rain‚Äô was a nice coincidence. And I am glad that my instinct was correct and it was a joy to put this clip together.

There is a clear difference between asking your adc to build an executioner's calling, and verbally assaulting people. 

It's frustrating because this attitude manifests in game (even in ranked). People seemingly have this idea that they can play the game however they would like to despite the fact that the game is becoming increasingly punishing to teams that do not play the game the way Riot wants.

The 'semi-solid' support structure doesn't get caught up with the model (unlike the default grid one) and just pops off, and the slightly stiffer trees, with a minimal support inside are more reliable at encasing and supporting thin model parts than the slightly too floppy 'bare tree'.

But for Kingdom in particular...I think the Hidden Blade really should be more customizable, it would be nice if we could put engravings on it and even upgrade it physically.

For example, adding a hook to help us climb things faster (from Revelations) or changing the base to let us turn it into a knife, like in 3, either for fighting with it or to help in looting animal bodies: [https://br.pinterest.com/pin/695454367427709585/?lp=true](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/695454367427709585/?lp=true)).

Tools wise, I guess the return of the smoke bombs and sleep darts would be up there on my list (also the rope-dart :D).  A more effective way to distract enemies like a rock from FC (or even a coin, from Hitman) would be nice (the torch from Odyssey is not a good replacement).

EDIT: Well, I am not offering much new ideas, but I think they have some good stuff already that they can bring back.",1580515446

The main creators and frequent pilots of Blood Pod (Lerker etc.) have all by stated that it isn‚Äôt viable against Fish Hulk. I have yet to play it since Thassa‚Äôs Oracle came out to be honest. 

As far as Hushwing Gryff effects are concerned, I wouldn‚Äôt run Torpor Orb. It‚Äôs too hard to remove and we need etb effects for all the main combo lines (Kiki Jiki and the Splinter Twin/Sharpshooter lines). Hushwing is a creature and at 3cmc can start the Pod lines into Kiki Jiki so it might be a good inclusion. Eldritch can also ‚ÄúPod‚Äù out Hushwing for Kiki if you have VBR or Felidar on field already. 

Hushbringer might also be good, but less useful since it‚Äôs 2 cmc. Still, it has lifelink which can mitigate life loss on Tymna draws. 

The good thing about Blood Pod is it does allow anti blue spells which Fish Hulk relies on. Anafenza doesn‚Äôt have R in her color identity making it more difficult. In Meta Pod you can run Red Elemental blast/Pyroblast/Guttural Response/Fry etc. 

But maybe just do yourself a favor and make your own Fish Hulk deck and hope you get the better draws against the other Fish Hulk players.",1580515446

"Christians","t5_2qk5n","I say this with love and respect, but think it‚Äôs odd you label yourself ‚Äúnondenominational‚Äù.  Either Jesus is our lord and savior or he is not. A Presbyterian is just as much a Christian as a Baptist, lutheran, or Methodist, and that qualifier doesn‚Äôt even enter into the equation when determining our faith. I go to a nondenominational church, but I am not a ‚Äúnondenominational Christian‚Äù. I‚Äôm just a Christian. 

The reason I bring that up is because Mormonism is not just ‚Äúanother denomination of Christianity‚Äù. Mormons are not Christians. They do not believe that Jesus is God, they do not believe in the trinity, and they do not believe in salvation by grace alone through faith alone. That‚Äôs not to mention that they believe good works results in us being gods of our own planets one day. Also, the Book of Mormon. She is not a Christian.

As another user mentioned, we are ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to do anything, but it definitely isn‚Äôt advised. Mormons are very particular about who they date. I find it highly likely she would refuse to date you unless you are Mormon, which either stops the problem before it starts, or it tempts you away from God. 

I would advise against it.",1580515447

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","The thing you're forgetting here is that most people vote emotionally, not rationally. Even most of the people who think they're voting rationally aren't really, because they've already decided who they want to vote for and their rationally is then selecting in favour of 'facts' that back up their existing opinion. And taking this example of gay marriage - you don't vote against it because it doesn't affect you, but would you vote *for* it if the politician also had some other opinions you didn't agree with? Probably not, because it's an issue that isn't fundamentally important to you.

The reason people are often so vehemently opposed to progressive policies like gay marriage or trans acceptance isn't because it actually hurts them, but because it *feels* like an attack on them. People make their values a part of their own identity - and rightfully so, for a man who does not has no convictions. Trouble is, when you then criticise those beliefs, or threaten to impose policies that would contradict them, that triggers the same physiological fight or flight response as staring down a tiger. No idea why, though. Maybe it was a survival advantage during humanity's tribal phase or something. We find policies that oppose our own principles genuinely frightening, and so we avoid them, and we often trick ourselves into thinking we hold our opinions for the good of society, too.

But at the end of the day, most voters are just voting to benefit themselves. Maybe they're not aware of this - in fact, they're probably not. But it turns out, if you promise people you'll do something they'll personally benefit from, they tend to like that. 

So, I'd be curious. Which political beliefs *do* you feel strongly about? Which ones are the ones that are primarily emotional? They're in there. They're in everyone. I have them too. But do you know which yours are?",1580515447

"BokuNoHeroAcademia","t5_34a0h","Well it's a very personnal theory that's mostly based on how I would like the story to develop, but I thought about it a bit and I think it'd be the most satisfying choice from a narrative and emotionnal pov. And I do have some clues (this might be pretty long sry).

First off why I suspect him.

Remember during the training camp when he was taken by Compress with Bakugo, we knew the objective was to kidnap Katchan and we've been told that he also took Tokoyami because he just destroyed Moonfish and all that. But what if it wasn't a kidnapping, but an exfiltration. 

I aways thought it was weird that both got caught so easily when they were probably on their gards, and  right behind Todoroki, Shoji and Midoriya. I believe Tokoyami manage to make Bakugo take some distance with the group, which was imo probably not hard, since Bakugo is not fan of the idea of being protected, then he just had to distract him so Compress could pick him up.

What they didn't plan was Aoyama's intervention that allowed Shoji to catch Tokoyami's capsule, thus the kidnapping was a success, but the evacuation was a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

Now why I think it'd be good for the story.

I love Tokoyami, he's so damn cool, and I think a lot of people agree. But how much has he been fleshed out ? Besides his internship with Hawks, we know very little about the birdbrain. To us he's an hilarious edgelord who also happened to have one of the strongest quirks of 1-A (which makes it even weirder that he's not developped yet), he's not been developped enough to be excluded from the suspect, but we care about him enough so that if it was indeed him, it would impact us emotionnaly. 

I wouldn't give two shits if it was Hakagure, Ojiro or Sato, and I never thought there was enough evidence against Kaminari, and  things like him doing the MLA sign is just waaaaay to obvious (definetly thinks Hori's trolling on that one).

Also wouldn't it be funny that Hawks, the double agent, took the UA traitor as an intern while both of them not having any clue that the other one is on the oppposite side ?

That's why I think from a narrative and emotionnal perspective, Birdboy would be the best option.",1580515448

"HFY","t5_2y95n","I would advise you to stop writing in brackets (). After someone has said anything. I am not sure if you are intentionally trying to break third wall or what's going on.

For example this part:
-How? (I asked like an idiot).

-I don‚Äôt kn‚Ä¶ (Second time, L‚Äômet was interrupted. But this time not by the AI, but by L‚Äôtan).

-I‚Äôm reading a gigantic, solid structure around us. It‚Äôs 1 AU big. In the center of it lays the star.

-Huh, angels of star! (I uttered without addressing anyone).

-Sir? (L‚Äômet asked).


 I would advise to write something more like this:


-How. 
I asked 

-I don‚Äôt kn.. 
L'met  replied before being interrupted a second time.


  

-I‚Äôm reading a gigantic, solid structure around us. It‚Äôs 1 AU big. In the center of it lays the star. 
L'tan declared

-Huh, angels of star! 
I uttered without addressing anyone.

-Sir?
L‚Äômet asked.




But I would prefer it this way a lot more as it makes conversation more telling and living in my opinion:


""How?"" I asked outloud feeling like an idiot. 

 ""I don't kn-"" L'met was interrupted a second time making his frustration grow.


L'tan starts reading from the monitor with excitement and equal nervousness  ""I‚Äôm reading a gigantic, solid structure around us. It‚Äôs 1 AU big. In the center of it lays the star"" 

""Huh"" I muttered in shock before I continued speaking to no one in particular  ""Angels of the star!"" 

L'met looked at me questioning
 ""sir?"".

In this format it much more pleasent to read and you can add small details that makes the characters more unique or living.  I don't write so I am sure others here can help you better than me,  this was just a general idea and and advice or look over how your characters interact with each other and how it is portrayed.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

You see, it's KAI'S fault that Onion slept with Sarah. Onion didn't even want to! But Kai loved Sarah SO MUCH that he forced himself to do so for the sake of ""the Trinity"" that Kai for sure wanted. Sarah raped them but Onion *sacrificed* himself for Kai so that Kai can still be together with his rapist!!

It's. Such. Horseshit. But since he seems to have convinced Kai that this is the case, that he convinces *himself* that, not only does it make sense (it fucking does not), but that other people must be easily convinced, too.

I've tried it before and it was successful (for a bit, of course the yeast eventually came back). I got fed up with dealing with the useless doctors so I'm not taking anything prescription at the moment, but I've been using clotrimazole for vagina which can be found OTC at specialty pharmacies. It's a cream that I insert 2 - 3 times weekly and I've felt pretty good since starting to take it. This is just a suppressant for me though since I've basically given up on finding a cure after this long, but it makes me comfortable and allows me to have sex. It's supposed to cure an infection if you use it for 7 days in a row though, so you could give that a try. However I've read quite a bit on recurrent yeast as you can imagine and it seems most people finally find success with boric acid. Also boric acid is used for both BV and yeast.

The Garden of Words (Japanese: Ë®Ä„ÅÆËëâ„ÅÆÂ∫≠, Hepburn: Kotonoha no Niwa) is a 2013 Japanese anime drama film written, directed and edited by Makoto Shinkai, animated by CoMix Wave Films and distributed by Toho. It stars Miyu Irino and Kana Hanazawa, and featured music by Daisuke Kashiwa instead of Tenmon, who had composed the music for many of Shinkai's previous films. The theme song, ""Rain"", was originally written and performed by Senri Oe in 1988, but was remade for the film and was sung by Motohiro Hata. The film was made into a manga, with illustrations by Midori Motohashi, and later novelized by Shinkai, both in the same year as the film.

**Makoto Shinkai**

Makoto Shinkai (Êñ∞Êµ∑ Ë™†, Shinkai Makoto, born Makoto Niitsu (Êñ∞Ê¥• Ë™†, Niitsu Makoto); February 9, 1973) is a Japanese animator, filmmaker, and manga artist best known for directing Your Name, the highest-grossing anime film of all time at the time of release, and was listed by Variety as one of 10 animators to watch in 2016.

"WitchesVsPatriarchy","t5_p3r73","I'm sorry you're dealing with all that; that's a really full plate. You've got this; you've been doing the right things, and it's going to work for you in the end - waiting is hard but finite.

And honestly, when you're stuck waiting, it's a good time for witchcraft.

Some advice, from someone who's been in a similar boat:

&amp;#x200B;

* Light candles and stare into their flames. Sit beneath trees. Take long baths and dream of women with shark teeth and oceans swallowing the coastal mansions of the rich.
* Go for long walks and whisper messages to the birds you see. Crows remember their friends, and songbirds speak of danger. Much can be divined by the patterns of birds.
* You are not hollow like a bottle, ready to be disposed of. You are hollow like a cave, dark and hidden and biding its time, full of strange beasts and ancient paintings. Hollowness does not make you worthless - it only means that fools are blind to the life within you.
* Lean on those who love you. Your brain lies when it calls you a burden - it speaks in the voice of your enemies.
* Spite those who dream of your failure. Every day of persistence mocks them. If you see no hope for yourself, then enjoy their rage, and let it give you strength for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

... like seriously when you can't get treatment or escape from your situation yet, self-care, exercise, and spite do a lot. That got me through, and you'll make it.",1580515453

I actually called my ex as I as I was coming down because I had this overwhelming surge of emotions that overtook me.

Talk about what it means. Talk about how ways you can or can't use the word. In our house, stupid is a word we can use sometimes, but not about people. We're not allowed to call anyone stupid. We have tasked the 4.5 year old with helping us make sure we use it correctly and he is eager to let us know when he hears his mom or me slip up and call someone stupid (we don't do that often. More often he hears us call some situation stupid and he jumps in to scold us anyway). 

Maybe if you've had that broad conversation, and it is a general rule in the house, and the kiddo gives you some buy-in, you can wait until you hear the behavior pop up and you can then intervene.

On the other hand technology and data analysis has gotten so good that cheaters can be more strategic. They don't have to drive the whole state election over a cliff - they can statistically figure out where to put pressure, where to make lines longer, where to make traffic snarls, and which voting machines need to conveniently ""break."" 

They won't bother cheating in places that are solid blue or solid red, it's too obvious and risky.

It is not.  It's a failed system and it has been running for centuries and we know for a fact that this way of doing things leads to failure over time.  Kind of like alcoholism and liver disease.
* We don't have 55 years before lethal climate change.
* Trying to make a dollar off something (i.e. 'economically viable') is precisely the wrong approach.  We need to use as little material and energy as possible in all of our designs.

Lipoid pneumonia is caused by the inhalation of oil. This does not mean that the oil has to be gasified; it can seep into the lungs in liquid form and cause lipoid pneumonia from the mouth (oil-pulling), nose, or lips (lip gloss). Mineral oil is even capable of seeping into the lungs from the [rectum](https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.09.3040). Intentionally coating the throat with oil and then gasping for air can easily lead to direct inhalation of oil. If you *do* do this, do not do it with oil often, as it builds up over time.

"Kombucha","t5_2qx36","I am a fan of yerba mate and it's traditional to wet the leaves with cool water to protect them from the harshness of the hot water. It enables the tea to retain the nutrients from the tea that may be lost from just adding dry tea to close to boiling water.

I am not sure if it makes a difference with other types of teas but I have brewed like this for a long time and I haven't had any bitter brews, even if I have oversteeped, and it makes me feel better about the nutrients of the tea being preserved (although I honestly don't know how much it helps).",1580515456

It wasn‚Äôt a complete genealogy file by any means, but it was a cool project to really tie people with places. We bring it out each family reunion and peruse through it. 

I want to turn it into a much larger project now, though, as recently I received a whole bunch of old photographs from the late 1800‚Äôs and early 1900‚Äôs, and I want to tie those into the project and provide more genealogical details as well as stories about these family members that my grandparents and their siblings have shared with me.

as for ‚Äúmoving on,‚Äù i wouldn‚Äôt even phrase it like that. that will happen quietly while you are busy focusing on you. think of this as a time to refine yourself, what you love and what you love to do. 

there will come a time when you‚Äôre happy for the memories you shared, and are able to see the value of the love you had, without being sad. also remember that it‚Äôs okay to feel however you feel, for as long as you have to feel it. everyone heals differently. good luck. (:",1580515458

To anyone really. 

Instead of you being you vs him, it‚Äôs you and him vs a problem. You and he have to find a solution together to get through this together. Whether that‚Äôs swaddling or cry it out or sleep training, etc. make a plan together.

This is a hard time and babies are beautiful and wonderful, but they kind of suck cuz they‚Äôre so much work. This won‚Äôt last forever, make sure your relationship isn‚Äôt damaged by disrespect or it won‚Äôt last either.",1580515458

So, I just got out of work, got my check, and went to my local check cashing place to get it cashed. After driving there ok, I get my check cashed and after starting my car and backing out of the space I'm in, it dies. I hit the brakes and throw up my hazards. I'm blocking half the parking lot so I put it in neutral and start pushing it back into the spot I just pulled out of. I call my ma and she askes what's going on. She asks if the lights turn on, and I say they do. She says does the car crank when I turn the key, I tell her it does. Then she asks if I ran outta gas. I said the gauge says I have a quarter of a tank. She then reminded me that the guy I bought the car from said the gas gauge can be finicky and since the car lights turn on and it's trying to crank over, it might be outta gas. She says she'll send my brother to come pick me up and take me to a good gas station to fill my canister. I say ok, cool and hang up. 

15 minutes go by and nothing. No sign of my brother, and nothing from him or my parents. It's a 5 minute drive to where I am at to where my brother was coming from so I assume he was in the middle of somthing so I messaged my ma and told her I'll just walk to the nearby gas station. It takes me about 16-17 minutes to get to the gas station, fill up, make my way back to my car. I fill the tank &amp; try to turn on the car and it turns over. I begin heading over to a better gas station to fill the car all the way when I get a call from my ma. She asks where I'm at and I tell her I'm just leaving the check cashing place now and going to a better gas station to fill up. She then begins to yell at me saying she told me to wait at the check cashing place and that she got some gas and was heading to the check cashing place. I said ""I messaged you and told you I was going to walk to the nearby gas station."" I then get told that they were getting ready to go out, and that they had to clean out a gas canister, so they didn't see my message and I should have called instead.

So my understanding of what just happend is: I have a car problem, I call them, we make a plan for my brother to pick me up and bring me to a gas station. A lot of time passes and he hasn't shown up. I then message them that I'll just walk to the gas station. No response from them. I get the gas, get the car started and start heading to gas station then get a very angry phone call about how I never f**king listen and that I should have stayed where I was. I hung up mid call cause I just couldn't believe I was being yelled at cause, from my point of view, they didn't bother to look at their phones for about 20 minutes, or at the very least tell me the plan changed.

Am I the asshole?

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","I‚Äôve been working on a D hero deck myself for a while and should you have any questions about combos etc then I can give you my input.

For starters, you need a destiny hero dominance (maybe 2). Summon him with Fusion destiny (FD) and when he‚Äôs destroyed by the effect of FD you can summon 3 D heroes from your GY. Good cards to summon with his effect; disc commander (draw 2 cards) draw hand ( draw 1 card) , doom lord (banish a monster next turn) drill dark (can summon a monster from your hand setting you up for a link summon or a D - fusion), and defender (good if you have a dark law on the field).
Dominance‚Äôs main effect can let you look at the top 5 cards of your deck or your opponents and arrange them how you want. Combine this with special summoning draw hand a disc commander when dominance pops then that‚Äôs a good strategy to plan ahead.

Dark angel‚Äôs effect confuses a lot of people, but she can be useful. You can discard her while you have 3 d heroes in the GY then special summon a d hero to your opponents side. I would only recommend 2 d heroes to do special summon. Dark angel herself because she will negate and destroy any spell yours opponent activated, or special summon defender because he will help y draw a card in your standby phase.

You asked about dynatag and he is essentially a hand trap to start with to just stall your opponents attacks. When he‚Äôs in the GY you can banish him and give a d hero 1000 attack. Try to use it on dystopia and activate his quick effect. Dystopia‚Äôs effect also works well with D tactics as it increases your heroes attack by 400 EVERY standby phase and you can use his quick effect once every turn.

Have at least one celestial in your deck because if you have no cards in your hand then you can banish him and another d hero from your GY to draw 2 cards. 

If you have a draw hand in your deck then you may as well have a drill dark in there as well as he‚Äôll help special summon him and you draw a card. 

Also chuck elemental hero stratos into the deck, he‚Äôs vital to most hero decks. Emergency call is a good card to have. 

If you want I can tell you my deck and give some more pointers as I‚Äôve done a lot of research on their archetype",1580515459

In your world, it is only true if you can Google it and get 5 MSM news sites offering it. Ok. I will work to your requirements. All of the below can be googled.


- it has doubled in infected every 6 days.
- it killed 11% of the first 99.
- wuhan  is bigger than london and filthier than a phuket or old west whore house.

- it occured after 5 million international flights occured between December and january 15th 2019- 2020 from the outbreak epicentre; Wuhan, China.
- it has infected 1 new country every day for the past 16 days
- it has every side of china (north south east west)
- it has every side of USA infected, who do the most international travel and have no free health care (LA, Chicago, washington, Florida)
- After the humans tried to fight it, on full alert, it still spread into europe,  the middle east and Russia.
- it has infected more in 37 days than sars did in 300 days.

228 million bodies by August 30th 2020.

"tuesday","t5_2r8s0","If the next President is Trump, then he could be worse his second term.

If the next President is Dem, I've a feeling the President will be clumsy and fail to make the significant cultural shifts necessary to make a functional government.

Electing a Dem won't make such great changes as people expect on the left. I don't think the major healthcare reform will pass. It was arduous with Obama and it's going to be even more so this time. I think a Public option might become real, but be hamstrung to be a real competitor to existing insurers. There is room for bipartisan measures to help healthcare, but we'll see how powerful lobbyists are. 

ICE will still be a problem a the next presidency. ICE unpopularity and dysfunction is not entirely Trump's fault. It has administrative and cultural problems up and down the department. (imo the solution to the ICE problem is actually getting the judicial branch beefier for immigration court. More judges, more funding, etc. And also a better foreign policy plan for our southern neighbors).

What I do expect is less cruelty in the next Dem president. Heck, even a Pence Presidency I'd imagine being less cruel. I expect a return of several Obama-era policies, especially if Biden wind. E.g. inspectors, pollution, etc. I do think decriminalization of marijuana will pass as well. I think foreign policy-wise we actually won't drift that far. We'll be just as reluctant to engage in foreign affairs, but if a Dem wins it'll be more polite and professional, and probably less spontaneous and impulsive.

Will the next President be competent? I think the burden of the maladministration by Trump will make that very difficult, regardless of who the successor is. Undoing that train wreck could take years if not presidencies. The next President, if a Dem, is going to be underwhelming.",1580515460

You‚Äôre giving your political ideology something akin to a hit of crack; a cheap mood picker-upper that is ultimately terrible for you, as well as being a blight on our political landscape.

The competent elected republicans hate the controversy Trump creates.  
* Trump undeniably caused the Republicans to lose the house in 2018.
* They held the Senate, but they had an extremely favorable Senate map (the 1/3rd of senators up for election were in all the right places for Republicans).
* They‚Äôre in trouble in 2020, and they know it.  

Read the Wall Street Journal:  they‚Äôre a center-right outlet with accurate, fantastic reporting (just ignore the opinion section and it‚Äôs articles, unless you know what you‚Äôre in for).  The WSJ has great connections within the RNC, and their take is this:  The motivation for this vote for Republicans, was a choice between two god awful choices.  Defend a vote to impeach your party‚Äôs president, or defend a vote to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôve heard enough‚Äù.  (The entire trial schedule was based around framing this stance - the image of exhausted senators leaving at 11pm, day after day... you realize that‚Äôs a carefully crafted narrative, yeah?

But just to play devil's advocate, let's say you invent a band new gun. Its radically different from anything that has ever been made. This hypothetical gun has nothing you would generally classify as a receiver. When you submit it to the ATF for approval before you start production, they will tell you what part will be treated as the reciever and that's where it's serial number will have to be stamped. You can't manufacture firearms for general sale without serial numbers. The portion they decide is most like a receiver will be treated as such. 

The other big point here, although the alphabet bois try to cause trouble, their rulings are guidelines and not the law. Judges have every right to go against an ATF ruling if it violates the law. And in this case, it looks like some judges have decided the alphabet boi's opinion of what constitutes a receiver is wrong. This is a pissing contest and not the norm. The norm is: an ar15 lower reciever is a firearm and has to be treated as such. Whether your armchair interpretation of rulings and/or laws likes it or not. Running around with your ""well technically an ar15 isn't a gun ü§ì"" argument is pointless and adds nothing to the conversation.

Nope.  For starters, there is no 'middle ground' given that they are diametrically opposed values. Second, I will not tolerate nor accept any level of unnecessary subjugation, especially if it is in the service of increasing subjugation more down the line.

&gt;Equality serves as a safety net

No it does not. There is no benefit to 'equality' (subjugation). The only thing it does it function as an easy method of collective virtue signaling. There is no benefit to 'equality' (subjugation).

&gt; the conflation of equality with subjugation isn't well justified here

Incorrect.

'equality' is de-facto subjugation. Two quick points; 'equality' functions through force, typically government force in order to strip the nation's citizenry of some form of liberty..... that is nearly the exact definition of subjugation.

But let's present it another way, 'equality' is the attempt to make different things the same.  The only way you make different things the same is by taking direct control or restricting them  in order to force them to do what you want. **That is textbook subjugation** . This isn't debatable, 'equality' as a value is just a placeholder for subjugation.

&gt; your argument seems to imply that any equality removes liberty

That is not an argument, that is irrefutable fact. You cannot have both as the advancement of one comes at the direct expense of the other. 'equality' taken at 100% is slavery. 

&gt;I dont think this holds, for the most obvious example the emancipation of slaves led to more equality and literal reduction in slavery.

.... are you trolling?

Liberty and freedom are functional synonyms. Freeing the slaves = liberation of the slaves = **liberty**. What a joke. I get that you're a hardcore leftist but that was stupid even by the standards of a hardcore leftist.",1580515463

The regulations did not change in anyway - we were asked from a compliance standpoint by the CCC to maintain very strict guidelines with our discount programs. The reason our notice contained CCC and ACS letterhead is that we pulled the updated documentation requirements directly from the CCCs guideline document outlining patient financial hardship. We never changed our discount rates or processes, but the CCC guidelines for proof of VFH specifically exclude mass health cards. The original notice for the patient fee waiver found here (https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2019/09/23/Patient_Fee_Waiver_Renewal_Application_Medical_Use_of_Marijuana_Program_0.pdf)
from the CCC, outlines the guidelines they set forth for Verified Financial Hardship discounts. 
We did not want to surprise any of our patients with this, which is why we made sure everyone got at least a verbal notice and the discount on their first visit after we had to update the requirements. We never wanted to frustrate any of our patient base, and always want to be available for questions. Please send any questions to info@acscompassion.com, if we can help or clarify this any further.

"IndoEuropean","t5_2ws4n","Keep in mind that one-on-one unarmed fights are not representative of warfare any more than a naked Eskimo is representative of arctic survival. Warfare is predatory, like hunting. If you‚Äôve ever seen videos of prison gangs killing someone, it doesn‚Äôt look like a fight. It‚Äôs an ambush. There‚Äôs no posturing or stare-downs to telegraph intentions. 3 or 4 guys jump someone, there‚Äôs a few seconds of fast movement, then they leave like nothing happened. The victim has dozens of stab wounds, but you wouldn‚Äôt notice anyone pulling out a weapon. 

Likewise, if you follow /r/CombatFootage you know that professional soldiers are not dramatic. They don‚Äôt sound like they‚Äôre fighting for their lives. Fistfights are for social jockeying, not killing. Humans don‚Äôt rely on their body strength, but they adapt to the situation by making tools, weapons or clothing. That‚Äôs what I mean by a software species. 

Humans could also have outcompeted Neanderthals by having the social cohesion to fight in larger groups. That may relate to more advanced language skills, but it doesn‚Äôt have to. There‚Äôs something to be said for the fact that Survivor-type reality shows are so popular. They tickle a part of the brain adapted for the opposite trend: in the absence of external enemies, people can compete by kicking competitors out of the tribe. That causes groups to shrink or split up through infighting. I find those shows insanely boring, but they would not exist if everyone felt that way. 

The smartest guy I ever met once pointed that what we call psychiatric problems are normal human drives taken to an extreme. Paranoia, anxiety, rage, depression, addiction, etc are all drives that are beneficial in moderation. We could not survive without them. (Turns out he too had a pathological drive for enjoying infighting, something I didn‚Äôt recognize until too late.)

A behavior only become a psychiatric illness when it interferes with day to day life. In fact, that‚Äôs what **defines** mental illness. If it‚Äôs crazy and it works, it‚Äôs not crazy. Or put another way, the distance between genius and insanity is measured only in success.",1580515466

"Stoicism","t5_2r4kq","The original quote was in reference to people. If something is interesting you have made a judgment. One of the points of stoicism is to describe things as specifically as possible. Ie if a person is drunk you shouldn‚Äôt say he drinks badly  only that he drank to much to remain sober. That is a summary from Epictetus (pretty sure it was Epictetus it could have been Marcus Aurelius). 

By calling something interesting you‚Äôve made a judgement. That‚Äôs an interesting child. The child could be a weirdo or the next Simone Biles. But never the less a judgment has been made. 

Even the quote he is writing about makes this point. He‚Äôs in the right direction. Just missed the mark a little when summarizing. That‚Äôs all. I am no way trying to bust his or her balls. That‚Äôs not my intention. If thats how it seems then we all need to practice more stoicism. 

Here is the full passage. 

When you go out into the woods, and you look at trees, you see all these different trees. And some of them are bent, and some of them are straight, and some of them are evergreens, and some of them are whatever. And you look at the tree and you allow it. You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn‚Äôt get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don‚Äôt get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree.

The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying ‚ÄòYou are too this, or I‚Äôm too this.‚Äô That judgment mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.",1580515467

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The judge eyes the group in front of them **""What of your charges of stealing?""**

We are not pickpockets, we are putpockets.
We put borrowed goods into the pockets of strangers.
Whose to say when a borrowed good is permitted for use by a third party?
Property is a tricky thing, but we are fairly certain the goods we are putpocketing are being given to their most rightful owner.

**""Fine. You have upheld the law beautifully. And trespassing?""**, the judge looks up again to the group after prying his eyes from their alleged charges.

Land, well that's even harder since we have to trace the inheritance back to the original owner.
It's true dwarves may have mined the caverns, but the night elves lived there with their spiders for centuries.
We had to insist that to the night elves obey the law to protect their territory.
The dwarves where all slaughtered, but it was well within the elves legal rights.
We were just ensuring justice was done once again.

**""Excellent! I must applaud your group for their tremendous commitment in upholding the law. Your group... as well as the elves... were completely within your legal rights as you said. Ah, the next charge is Assault and Battery, but I wouldn't be surprised if your group has a perfectly reasonable explanation for these as well, by this point""**, the judge smiles and fixes his glasses. He truly has never seen a more law-abiding group then the party in front of him.
 
Assault and Battery is quite difficult to follow but we do our best.
In order to follow the law, we make sure to put our friends in a perpetual state of comfort.
They always give us verbal consent and follow whatever command we give them.
We didn't intend for them to walk into the lion's cage to pet the lion; we simply suggested that they could pet the lion if they wanted to, but I guess there is a downside to removing all fear from someone.

**""Yes, I can see how very difficult it must be. You simply cannot predict what people will do in an absolute state of comfort. I applaud your commitment in putting your friends at ease""**, the judge happily states. **""Next up, can you please explain to the court these bribery charges?""**

We always broker deals between citizens and people of political or public standing.
We make sure that neither party receives anything of value judge.
While neither party gets what they need, or want,
at least our group has ensured that no corruption has occurred.
This way everyone gets nothing for nothing.
We can't help it if the citizens choose to incite a coup, but we did our jobs yet again.

**""Yes. Once again extraordinary work! Ah yes, can you describe these disorderly conduct charges?""**, the judge asks.  

We've had good success with our anti-disorderly conduct charms.
These are activated automatically when a citizen is mildly inconvenienced by another.
To be safe we render anyone in the immediate-area into a temporary comatose state.
This ensures the peace is kept whether they be passenger, pedestrian, or driver.
A few severe accidents may occur as a result, but our group has sworn to uphold the laws and at least this way we've dutifully upheld the peace in town.

**""Fascinating!""**, the judge looks up from his papers whispering to the group, **""if you have the time, I'd love to learn all about this charm you've spoke of... it sounds delightful. Best to control the area in these situations. Next, we shall proceed onward to the extortion charges""**.

We have fought hard against Extortion in our town's businesses.
We provide favors in exchange for cooperation with local business owners.
Those who wish to earn those favors must simply contribute to the community fund.
Those local owners are given great incentives and they are often more than happy to benefit from our Rewards Program.
Under no circumstances does our rewards program protect those owners who are able to contribute from the owners who are unable to contribute.
We encourage the owners consent to ""Trial by Combat"" to settle these disputes. While this service is accepted as contribution, we simply cannot control who the victor is.

**""I can see there is certainly no promises of threats, and it is clear to me that settling disputes this way provides an alternative option for those who can't contribute to the rewards program.... Very impressive... I see this has done wonders for the economy as well! I see the next charge here is that you've eliminated the possibility of forgery. Another innovative solution, if I say so myself!""**.

Ah so you've heard of our solution? It was quite easy. Each person can imitate each others works and documents. Neither party remembers who the original author is supposed to be.
We can safely say since this spell was cast that there can no longer be any forgery case. While, this has lead to several cases of distraught partners filing vengeful surgical forms on their alleged cheating spouses, we can say this has eliminated all forgery crimes.

**""Yes, you simply cannot control the actions of others... well said! While there is a clear downside here, this does allow us to conduct business posthumously or to file forms on the behalf of beloved family members who are unable to do so. We shall take what we can on this one. We can only hope these forms are as correct as they can be""**, the judge folds up the parchment having reached the end.

**""Well done, all of you. While there have been many casualties, I see no legal fault in your own actions. Any mayhem caused by your commitment to upholding the law was caused by factors outside the realm of your control. Court is adjourned, thank you so very much for your service""**, the judge bangs the gavel as he heads out of the courtroom.

The rogue turns to the party, ""Are you sure we needed to compel the judge in seeing our side?"". ""Yes"", the cleric responds, ""how else do you think the judge could have possibly sentenced us both legally and fairly?"". The rogue nods his approval. ""Let's go get drunk"", the rogue says. ""Yes, let's drink men"" says the warrior emphatically. The group leaves the burning courtroom before it completely collapses behind them. The town is forever marked by the group's mayhem from *establishing order*. The tavern is the only building that still remains in the town of mostly ruins. The rogue facepalms as he remembers, ""Aw shoot! Didn't we kill the bartender?"". ""Serves him right"", the  Wizard says, ""he was actually going to charge us for beer!"".

I usually don't use reddit because of [censorship problems](/r/watchredditdie), but I came here because it seemed to be where discussion was happening and I thought these subs would be fine with different mods.  I guess the whole platform really is compromised, even for this.

Less censored spaces:

* [4chan /pol/](https://boards.4chan.org/pol/catalog) seems to have the most up-to-date info, it's where I first heard about [the virus possibly being engineered](/r/4chan/comments/etmt8s/4chan_autists_possibly_confirm_coronavirus_is_bio/).
* [notabug.io/t/outbreaks](https://notabug.io/t/outbreaks) is similar to reddit, but is not yet complete.
* the [fediverse](https://search.social/?q=coronavirus) is similar to twitter but decentralized. In my (very limited) experience [freespeechextremist.com](https://freespeechextremist.com) is a bit slow/buggy, but seems to censor less than some other fediverse servers, and is open for anyone to make an account.

I'd love to know other less censored spaces to talk.  /r/redditalternatives and [/s/decentralizeallthings](https://saidit.net/s/DecentralizeAllThings/wiki/index) has some other ideas.

I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to diet pre op and knew I was going to have some break up and goodbye meals with my favorite foods but on the scale I maintained or lost a couple lbs each time just based on what I wore to the weigh in.

Anyway. I just wanted to ask, how do you feel about Liberal‚Äôs insistence on propping up private heathcare? And what do you think about Liberal‚Äôs history of antagonism towards the idea of public healthcare?

I personally think healthcare should be a public service. You are guaranteed to become ill at some point in your life, so the idea of paying insurance for this ‚Äúchance‚Äù is silly. It relies on a portion of the population (young people) paying for something they don‚Äôt need, to subsidise a portion of the population (old people) that does need it.

the only thing I would change is a dynamic switching based on driving, like if I'm putting around at low RPM I want it to be in comfort, but if I'm driving more aggressively I'd like for it to just switch to the sport mode automatically.",1580515470

Savings that you think you'll need in less than 5 or 6 years (eg. emergency fund, next vehicle purchase, down payment savings, etc.) should be parked in good [high interest savings accounts](https://www.highinterestsavings.ca/chart/) or locked into [GICs.](https://www.highinterestsavings.ca/gic-rates/)  Don't choose the GIC option unless they are paying a premium and you are confident that you won't need the money for the duration of the GIC contract.

If you have reached Step 5 of the [PFC money Step steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps) and you have some money you are confident you won‚Äôt need for at least 10 years you could  invest in a low cost, passively managed, globally diversified, index tracking (i.e. ""couch potato"") portfolio such as those discussed on the following pages.
	
https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/investing

If you'd like to be a more confident investor, so you can avoid the costly but normal human reactions to the markets and the media that reports on them, I suggest that you read the Canadian book Millionaire Teacher.  (Andrew Hallam, 2nd edition - 2017.)",1580515470

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not really a rage quit but definitely was an emotional quit of sorts. I loved playing Project Zomboid online. Finally got gud in online play. Used to trek to a town that you couldn't spawn into. It was really difficult to get there if you werent properly provisioned. Getting there took 1.5 real life hours to run to depending on your spawn. That is running flat out and avoiding Zed all along the way if you have enough food to avoid scrounging. That town in question was totally free of griefers and had an awesome little community of survivors. So long as you didnt grief or cause mischief, you were welcomed with open arms. We referred to ourselves as the hippy community because things were so chill. This kind of community meant alot of collaboration, leading to alot of better security measures from Zed. Lone Griefers would show up from time to time but we always banded together to put their asses in the ground. We always had an overwhelming amount of firepower.

So, the reason I quit is because one day, another player and I were dicking about and were going to make a foray into a part of town that had alot of Zed. To do so, we had to climb down a wall. I stupidly got caught by Zed in a situation that I should have been better prepared for. The other player rescued me but in turn got his character killed in the process. He had had that character since the previous server wipe, so the character was almost 5 months old. That's a god damn long amount of time for a PZ character. He didnt blame me but I felt so guilty and responsible I never logged back in",1580515472

If people are so selfish they can't set aside $25 then I've lost hope in humanity.
2. Paying for degrees will benefit things like science, as we'll have more professionals available in certain fields that otherwise couldn't have afforded the financial struggle.
3. Not everyone can get decent scholarships. Not everyone will enjoy playing 20 bajillion sports or being elected to the student council to make themselves more marketable to schools and such

Having a line is *NOT* a grudge or a bad thing. You crossed it, and she has literally every right to ask you to stop texting, hanging out or interacting with her.

Along with some other feedback that was nasty, but it was his judging my performance based on perceived emotional state that was way over the fucking line.

A few days later I chatted him. I reminded him of the conversation, told him I want my performance to be judged on my technical work and impact, sent him a link on how womens' performance reviews contain attitude-related wording at a rate far higher than men's, and informed him that I was setting the boundary of not talking to him about my feelings.

He apologized, kind of badly (""truly sorry if I was over the line"") and hasn't given me shit since.

They lost because Serbia had better allies.  And Germany got punished severely for that.  Post-WWI Germany was a shit-show due to the Treaty of Versailles.

One day I log in, and I notice that it is starting me from scratch, from the beginning. Well, the way the game is set up, you can't contact support until you create your account. However, once you create a new account, you override your old account. So, I went through, created an account, tried contacting support and they tell me I need my User ID (which is just 20 random numbers generated when you create your account) to restore my old account. The only way to see your user ID is when the game is loading a level, but I have a particularly fast phone and I never had the chance to see it.

I'm 4-5 years old, and very lactose intolerant, HOWEVER, I learned this years later.

I'm in New York City with my mom on a one of her business trips. We're walking through China Town looking for something to eat after a fantastic day spend visiting museams in the city. I suddenly get the feeling, you all know the one, the 'I have to shit RIGHT NOW' feeling. I look up at my mom and say I have to go. She says we'll find a bathroom soon. I look back silently, she can see in my eyes that the situation is dire.

We run into the nearest chinese restaurant, she asks for a bathroom.

""Customers only, sorry.""

We go to a second chinese restaurant, my sphincter is tight, my stomach is churning.

""Customers only, sorry.""

My mom's throws (literally throws) $5 at the host and says, ""I'll take a soda""

We sprint through the restaurant, and find a door in the back. The door leads down a narrow set of stairs, with another door at the bottom. I'm clenching with all my might and my stomach sounds like a thunder storm. I keep saying, ""I gotta go!""

We make it to the bottom, and the damn breaks. I start bawling, as shit flys out of me. Down both legs of my pants, into my shoes and socks. My bowels expelled with such force that it shot out my waistband onto my shirt and stained the middle of my back. I'm standing there swimming in my own shit, crying my eyes out looking at my mom for help.

She ushers me into the, thankfully single person, bathroom and spends at least 20 minutes cleaning the filth from every inch of my body in the sink. My clothes are so caked in shit that we leave them, stuffed in a wad in the trash. Which is one of those small decorative ones, so the little boy shit clothes are more piled on top that placed inside.

So now I'm completely naked, but no longer covered in shit. My mom decides to give me her dark denim jacket, which falls just above my knees. We walk out of the restaurant and never look back. My mom later told me I played with my weiner the entire taxi ride back to the hotel.",1580515476

Compare that to the brexit referendum. Where literally every economist and anyone with a brain said. If you vote for this, This will harm you. But people still did it. Because flags. Because foreigners. And if there were medicine shortages? If there were people dying? All worth it. Because WE ARE GREAT BRITAIN. Rinse and repeat until you get tired off it.

""Private firms refused government contracts and directions on many occasions. In 1937, de Wendel, a coal mining enterprise, refused to build a hydrogenation plant. In 1939, IG Farben denied a government request to increase its production of rayon and refused to invest in a synthetic rubber factory despite this being an important project for the regime. Froriep GmbH, a company producing machines for the armaments industry, successfully demanded cheap credit from the Nazi government under a threat of cutting back investment if its demand was not met. The regime generally used monetary incentives, such as guaranteed profits, to persuade businesses to support its goals, and freedom of contract was generally respected even in projects important for the war. According to historians Christoph Buchheim and Jonas Scherner, the reason why businesses sometimes refused these incentives was out of long-term profitability considerations.""",1580515478

&gt; Ork: nah it aint happening. Orks are extremely resilent to physical damage, theyre essentially just muscle with a thick hide so a single stab from a bayonet is not gonna cut it. Maybe 5+ guardsmen might do it maybe.

A normal orc boy is of course much, much scarier in melee than a guardman. But they still die when stabbed by a bayonet somewhere major it wouldn't take 5+ guardsmen to do with; A pair or three could easily deal with a bog standard orc. Remember we have narratives of feudal worlds fighting feral orcs in melee and killing them, these people are very much not guardsmen level.

Also 99.9% of orc attacks in the setting are held by the guard, the Astartes might drop pod in kill a warboss or blunt a major assault but the actual killing is done by guardsmen, who have get to bayoneting a fair bit of the time.

&gt; Eldar: definitely not, eldar percieve humans how we perceive sloths, in slow motion basically. An eldar guardian would likely land multiple hits before a guardsmen even registered the first one.


Most eldar aren't even warriors, even their main fighting force, Guardians,  are simply militia wearing war masks led by aspect warriors. They have the same stat line as guardsmen on tabletop and it think it's very fair to say they're at a similar level 1-1-ness. 

The thing that is so impressive about Eldar Guardians is they're basically the Eldar's equivalent of PDF, yet they can and do regularly engage Astartes/Necrons/Nids.


&gt; Necron: probably could get a couple stabs in but what's a knife going to do against a metal construct that can repair itself and then hell just wack you with his bladed gauss rifle.

Despite getting it *right* you've mis-sold how true terrifying necron warriors are, they're basically Astartes level in melee and are about as hardy as Astartes if you consider Astartes' better armour.",1580515478

"LabourUK","t5_30c1v","If it was British people instead of Iraqis would you still use the same argument that he's exempt from being the worst leader because he had better domestic policy than the Tories?

Maybe you think this is necessary but really it isn't and it infact makes Blair and New Labour look worse. If you reread my point you'll see, contrary to what you're saying, I didn't say he was worse than the Tories. The Tories wouldn't have done anything better and probably done a lot of worse things. So unless you're suggesting that Iraq was necessary to do anything else Blair or New Labour did you don't have a point that goes against what I'm saying Iraq wasn't necessary, it was a disaster, and the high price of it makes it difficult to argue that ""yes anyone who wins an election even with all the Iraq stuff is exempt from being worst leader because they are always better than the Tories"".

If I was indifferent I wouldn't have voted Labour despite my feelings over this. I think you're either being indifferent or not realising what a blunder Iraq was, the amount of abuses that too place and the huge unnecessary suffering inflicted on innocent people who matter every bit as much as British lives. All the sure start centers and NHS funding in the world don't make anything about Iraq any better.

"Bundesliga","t5_2s82y","The R√ºckrunde has just started, so let's not get carried away with enthusiasm for the current season. Regarding next season: Bayern have many national team players, and this year, they will start the Hinrunde after having played the European championship during the summer. So, injuries could be a factor.

But with all the new players they have integrated over the past couple of years, and the overall young age of the squad, I think there are reasons for optimism. Bayern's game is all about ball control and precise passing, so understanding between the players is crucially important. The lack thereof after all recent additions was, I believe, the major problem this Hinrunde. But now that everyone's had time to get in sync, I am much more hopeful.

The one nagging issue to me is the extreme reliance on Lewy. Without him, the team is only worth half as much. He will turn 32 in August, so we will have to see whether he can maintain his spectacular form through a tough season, the Euro championship, a short recuperation time, and on into next season. If so, I am sure that Bayern will be formidable next season.",1580515480

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;I think of an example: Suppose I am going to a big multi-tenant office building for a meeting. As I step in the door, crowds of people are quickly moving out of the building. I ask them what's happening, and get reports that the building is on fire. I don't hear an alarm or see smoke or flame. I ask about this as people run by and get vague answers - the alarm is out, the fire is on the upper floors, it's a chemical fire, it's toxic gas not a fire, etc. In a real world situation, would I follow the path of waiting for sufficient evidence and continue to my meeting until I see some evidence of disaster, or would I head back outside with the crowds, putting my trust in their collective judgement?



A building being evacuated and people telling you that ""the building is on fire"" *is* sufficient evidence to accept, tentatively, that the building may in fact be on fire. Just as someone telling you ""I have a pet dog"" is sufficient evidence to accept, tentatively, that someone does in fact have a pet dog.


Different claims have different standards of evidence that are required to justify that claim. We live in a world where buildings do in fact catch fire, where fire alarms do not necessarily sound all the time, and where fires are not necessarily visible from outside even when they're ongoing.


Therefore if you are approaching a building which is being evacuated, and you are told by people that the building is on fire, you would be rationally justified in going along with the evacuation attempt. You're not believing that fire is occurring *because* lots of other people believe it, you believe that the fire is going on - or at least tentatively accept that you should take precautions against that possible fire - because of what you know about reality and because you know that buildings catch fire and that evacuations of what occur when buildings catch fire. What you know about the reality of a building *being* on fire - something that demonstrably can occur - corresponds to what you are witnessing.


You are **not** simply believing X because lots of people believe X. And I suspect that you would probably still attempt to contact the people who were involved in your meeting to explain your absence and verify the situation anyway.


If you saw people pouring out of a building and they said ""There's a pixie flying around the building using a magic wand to turn everyone into a goat"", I suspect you *wouldn't* believe them. And would in fact thing that some kind of trick was being played.


&gt;I see a similar situation in religion. Whereas (arguably) theists cannot produce material evidence for the existence of god(s), it is hard to deny that theistic beliefs have been in the majority for all of recorded history.


The claims are not equivalent. Fires can be demonstrated to *exist*. A mundane claim does not have the same standards of evidence as the claim that a magical invisible genie wished the universe into existence by casting a magic spell, and gets really upset about gay people for some reason.



&gt;The deep-seated theistic bias of the vast majority of humanity comes across as very convincing to me. Even if it's proven to later be fallacious, it seems like the appropriate choice here and now.


That's because you don't appear to understand that different claims have different standards of evidence that would be or should be required to accept them. Some claims you *can* be justified taking someone's word for, and others demand greater evidence.",1580515482

"ElizabethWarren","t5_2swe3","I don't agree at all. M4A was the reason she was rising, not the reason she fell. She supported it for months and surged to the top. Sanders made a wise decision to avoid right-wing traps about how to pay, she didn't. You make it sound like he hasn't been dealing with ""HOW YA GONNA PAY 4 IT!?"" for years. Warren, was just unprepared for an all out assault from the other candidates and the biased moderators. She also boxed herself in when bringing up how she would never raise middle-class taxes, a classic mistake.

Trump  made the same mistake on his stupid wall. Lying about how Mexico would pay for it for political points, while boxing himself into a corner. Getting into specifics about paying for your plans is always a losing strategy. As disingenuous as it sounds, it's smart  to avoid those questions, especially from dishonest actors, and it also doesn't hurt to have a cult supporting you in the case of Trump.",1580515482

So he'll have that going for him, and you didn't have to go through any difficulties waiting to get to that point.

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","I‚Äôm not suggesting anyone skips steps. I am attempting to make UFOlogy more scientific.

Scientists I speak to (uni, govt, business) would love to look at UFO photos and research them. However they say it‚Äôs not up to them. When they finish university.., they don‚Äôt choose to investigate or ignore UFOs. It‚Äôs simply not an option, as they are employed.., not employers.

There are no scientists to send UFO evidence to.., and realistically we already have enough 2nd hand data from civilians imo. It‚Äôs not their job, as scientists do this thing FOR citizens. We don‚Äôt demand they gather more forms of data. We pay scientists for that role.., not plumbers, farmers and builders etc.

Through whatever path? I‚Äôm VERY interested in knowing what people should be doing instead. Step by step guide to stop UFO witnesses from wasting more time.

I don‚Äôt think Astronomy is suited for UFOlogy either. https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOdiscussions/comments/dgo7qn/what_is_the_best_scientific_discipline_for_ufology/

There is no burden of proof, as shown in the link provided earlier https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOdiscussions/comments/cp9rb0/the_burden_of_proof/

There is no reason to look into UFOs? Why? Because there is a lack of evidence. However.., is that not more of a reason to look? Test hypothesis, analyse results. Gather new forms of evidence? Not just the same 2nd hand story and images repeatedly?

It‚Äôs not a straw man argument. I was replying. You never mentioned wasting money before. To bring this up would be considered a straw man Imo. With the amount of money wasted on YouTubers etc.., I think we are fine. People playing Minecraft getting $5 and $10 donations every 30 seconds.... not to mention view revenue.

Exactly. I won‚Äôt find scientists making such an outrageous claim that they cannot be real. It‚Äôs simply unprovable, almost like saying there scientifically cannot be a god or ghosts or other dimensions. How can you prove that? But.., you did make that claim earlier.

Yes, same conversation. Please try to calm down, as you are taking this issue personally and emotions are starting to come into play. Just respond normally without the toxic angry, frustrated attitude. Take a break, don‚Äôt let it affect you so much. It‚Äôs not worth your Heath.

Most people rely on YouTube, anecdotes etc to form ‚Äúscientific conclusions‚Äù about UFOs. What information are you relying on to form these conclusions you have so far? How is this better than Hessdalen UFO observatory, and their 1st hand observations? Why can‚Äôt they look into it? Why is it so hated? So much emotion surrounds the subject it seems.",1580515484

"AskEurope","t5_2uayg","my grandfather apparently had a hunting rifle, but that's the only member of family who has, to my knowledge, owned one, and I have a really big family in a rural part of the country.

The only firearms I have ever seen are assault rifles when antiterrorism police do some patrolling in the main cities of the country. 

I think it's pretty uncommon to own one. You need a proper psychiatric background check and justify it to the police, and even then, if you want to carry it outside your house, I understand the criteria are pretty stringent.

According to wikipedia, there are 8 million firearms in Italy, meaning that 14% of the population has one. The general consensus has been so far that the status quo was OK, with mostly people into hunting or in really isolated places owning one but keeping it at their domicile. Lately, though, the far right parties in the parliament have pushed for more guns and more lax definition of legitimate defense, after high profile cases of robberies and burglaries gone awry, so that private citizens can defend themselves without consequences.",1580515484

C. Capitalism has no doubt badly distorted the fitness world just as it has done everything else. Fraud, lies, false promises, and pseudoscience are not only allowed they are encouraged in the fitness marketplace. The cause of this is that the true path of fitness cannot be commodified, for it lives within us. With enough determination one can become fit without ever buying a single product. The vast majority of the fitness industry should not exist. Imagine all the labor and money wasted every year producing overhyped do-nothing supplements and nonsensical fitness equipment. There should only be communal public gyms accessible to everyone staffed with qualified professionals of the local fitness syndicate.

""Yes! For the North! For the King!"" Ignoring the confused and angry looks he walked toward Jon Stark and turned to the remainder of their army. 

""Men! This battle is the last one against the dead! Today we fought, we bled, and we died, to keep the realms of men safe, and yet, where are the other realms? Where is the Reach, where are the Valemen, where are the rest of the fucking southrons, where is the fucking ""Iron Stag"" we supposedly fought for?! They're playing their fucking games of greed and power, while we fight alone. We Northmen Remember, we remember thousands of years of honorable, fair, just Stark rule, we remember when the southrons repeatedly slighted us, when they left us to fend for ourselves time and time again, and expected us to lick the dirt off their shoes."" 

""No longer will I bend to any southron King, not a dragon, or stag, or a fucking mocking bird! I will fight only for one King!"" He paused to breath looking over each of the men.

""100 years ago our ancestors raised the Stark banner for the Young Wolf, it's time we raise it again, for the White Wolf! Here stands my King my lords, the King in the North! Long may he reign!"" 

Eddard dropped to one knee in front of his lord, no, his king, his heart was racing, from battle or fear, he didn't know, but he knew it was right.

"BoJackHorseman","t5_2zzfr","One thing that I've always worried about with the show is that they constantly have bojack progressing towards doing better, and then something huge sending him spiraling back. It makes sense as both a way to extend the series and to show that the path to redemption (if that's what they were going for) isn't linear. 

For all of that to end with him in the middle of another downward spiral and with everyone moving on without him makes it not much different than the end to any other arc in the series, and for that in my mind its more meaningful if he did die.

I think what we saw in the beginning up to him dying in the paper was real, and then it cut to him surviving and rushed through the fallout as a way of his consciousness filling in the blanks as it transitioned to the party where he made his final reconciliation with his friends. 

All of his friends storylines didn't feel like they were fully explored or wrapped up. Idk if I just wasn't paying close enough attention, but PC and judah seemed to come out of nowhere and Diane and Guy just never really made sense, but with that time skip that's what his mind created as a way of showing that his friends are moving on and finding happiness in their lives without him. Things aren't necessarily logical or satisfying because it's  all his mind doing the best he can.

He knows that he caused a lot of pain for his friends, and the last bit of peace he gets in this sort of afterlife is to know that he won't be a burden on them anymore and that they will be alright.

There's a lot of people saying that the writers didn't want to just have him die because of the message it could send to vulnerable fans, and that's possible, but they also could have tried to make it intentionally ambiguous and open ended to invite discussion. However imo, with the way the ending was presented, the journey seems pointless without the consequence and finality of his death.

Edit: I didn't elaborate on each character, but I agree with your analysis of them all. It's as if as far as he knew that is what each of his friends wanted or needed, but didn't know the details of how their lives would turn out so this is what his subconscious created.",1580515485

Fact of the matter is that the answer to your question is neither. The only video he‚Äôs expressed doubts on quality was a kinda sappy but motivational one he made like a year ago, and he made a roughly equally old video doubting his role as a Youtuber, and my claim about being dissatisfied with his work is a loose interpretation of a more recent video.

&gt;Excellent, can you link those?

Look, if you really are a ‚Äúdebate me‚Äù type like someone else accused you of being, you‚Äôre best off doing the research yourself. I gave you some vague places in his upload history, and if you don‚Äôt wanna be mocked by him or booed offstage by a lot of us, the best option to figuring out why he believes what he believes is to do some research on your own, and if you would like to know why you got some responses about how all those seemingly different labels are under the umbrella of fascism, I‚Äôd recommend [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx4BVGPkdzk) that isn‚Äôt by him, but covers a lot of the foundational framework of how we tend to identify fascists in the field that Olly didn‚Äôt include in his video.",1580515485

For the western society to claim that they are arguing against animal cruelty in Chinese food traditions and then turn back and say I could go for a nice juicy steak or some bacon is just delusional.

And also, the reason why criticising those other cultures is not as racist is bc it is not being used to argue against an individual. When was the last time you heard someone say ""If a european gives me the bubonic plague and I survive, I will spend my life hating those dirty fuckers"" bc people have said that about the chinese recently, and no I don't think that post on r/trashy is representative of the general populace but it is still a (very highly) exaggerated form of your distaste for the chinese.",1580515486

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","When you look at the people in your church, or any church for that matter, what kind of people do you see? How many of them have been through what you have been through? Divorce, drugs, alcoholism, bipolar, suicidal, no job, as you said, rock bottom.
Now, look at the people outside the church, who have fallen away or never been at all, what kind of people do you see? I'm not sure what you are feeling called towards, but to me, preaching is not for those already in church, but to draw in those outside the church and invite them in. ""Preaching to the converted"" is a phrase that means it's accomplishing nothing, because it's not the saved who need it but the lost.
What kind of people outside the church are more lost than those who are going through divorce, drug abuse, alcoholism, bipolar disorder, suicidal thoughts, joblessness. People at rock bottom.
Why would God want you to preach? Why would He not? Who better to connect with the people outside of the church than someone who has been in their shoes? Who knows exactly what it feels like to have things fall apart, to fight and struggle and feel helpless, to know the agony of each and every one of those things. Who can stand up and give them hope. Not hope in the world, not hope in material things, but hope in God.

Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things¬†‚Äì and the things that are not¬†‚Äì to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him. It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God¬†‚Äì that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: ‚ÄòLet the one who boasts boast in the Lord.‚Äô - 1 Corinthians 1:26-31",1580515487

I have been going to a consular for about 8 years, but even that it seems is losing its helpfulness. And with no more insurance, that might slip away soon plus no medication nor support left.

Hence why I was asking about a job, because of basically no skills, no one will hire or even take a look and no history for the last decade means ‚Äúoh he is lazy and just biking off his mom.‚Äù, and I need a job to get insurance, since doctors won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt diagnose me with something or the doctor visits cost 180 per visit, to get access to medication, dental and consular help, to try to get better.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Didn't even have to read the post:  your boyfriend is abusive and you need to flee.

Some advice:

* Gather up Team You and tell them you need help.

* Go to either thehotline or loveisrespect and read up on how to escape an abusive relationship.  Call someone and talk to them about your situation.  Listen carefully to their advice.

* Understand that the ""love"" you feel for your bf, the idea that you can't live--hell, can't actually breathe--without him is the result of a strange chemical dependency called *trauma bonding.*  You know those insane, euphoric highs you experience whenever he's nice to you?  Yeah, those are essentially the same highs that heroin gives you, and they create an addiction:  you are as addicted to those highs as a junkie is to smack.  *Your addiction would literally prefer that you die rather than leave him,* so it tells you awful things about yourself, about your future, in the hope that you won't deprive it of its next fix.  Fortunately, addictions can be kicked.

* Therapy.  The damage that abuse does may seem to abate, but it never goes away without help.  

* Do not go back to his place unless you have something of irreplaceable value there you need to fetch--and even then only if you are accompanied by someone.

* Go no contact.  Completely.

* Read *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft.

* Read up on stalking, because he's going to do that, if only for a few days.  Go to ""the stalking clearinghouse"" for some advice.

Do not meet up with him to give him ""closure.""  Do not be anywhere alone with him:  know that the most dangerous moment in an abuse victim's life is when they leave their abuser.

Stay safe.",1580515487

"kpoprants","t5_2973ru","Here's my opinion: stage presence is a skill you can improve on. I used to work in an advertising agency, and for a while, I saw many musicians perform at the office. Most of them were unknown musicians, some were famous people. I never really put a thought into stage presence until a guy from Bon Jovi came to perform. I am not a Bon Jovi fan, as should be apparent since I don't remember which member of Bon Jovi it was (not the lead singer obviously), but that guy was awesome: he seemed super approachable, his voice was really powerful. None of the other musicians I had seen until that point (Hanson was another group that performed for us) had his level of stage presence/charisma. But the thing is, that Bon Jovi guy was also one of the oldest performers we saw, with decades of experience performing on stage. For some people, stage presence is natural, and for others it takes work to get there.

K-pop idols are fairly young, so I think it's understandable if they don't have awesome stage presence. Also, because many k-pop idols are in a group, I think a k-pop idol can get by without stage presence if some other members are more charismatic...I mean honestly, the reasons so many k-pop groups are huge is so members don't need  to be all-rounders.",1580515487

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

That Amy angle is a great catch, by the way. There's a really gross, patriarchal vibe to the negativity that's there.

They represent the view that the future and past cannot be altered in time travel theories. They showed the alpha legion the future that came to pass in 40k with the intent of stopping it.

That said, Matteo, as a character and love interest, had SO MUCH more depth than Charlie. Charlie wore his heart on his sleeve, and what you saw is what you got. Matteo, on the other hand, had so many layers, and I loved being able to peel back those layers, getting past the stoic and rigid exterior to find the kind, softhearted man inside.
