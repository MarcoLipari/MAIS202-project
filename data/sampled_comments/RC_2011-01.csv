"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;Actually perhaps he was talking about a completely different god altogether. Perhaps the old testament god did create another god who promptly destroyed the old one for being a bit of a selfish and evil bastard. Perhaps the new testament god who Jesus says is his father is this new god. That would explain a lot.

Perhaps you are familiar with the original Christianity, 
[Marcionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism).

The Christian adversary Celsus, who debated with Origen, understood “Christians” to mean primarily Marcionite Christians—which permits a significant inference about the spread of Marcionism at this time. (Tertullian, AM 5.19; Justin, Apol., 1.58)

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","How would we define ""fucking up your kid mentally""?  To those parents, allowing their child to listen to music or read a novel is irreparably harmful.  To us it's fantastic.  The worst part of freedom will always be having to accept that some people are going to say, do and believe incredibly stupid things and there is very, very little we can do to change that.  We can be ourselves, we can fight systemic and societal racism, homophobia, and misogyny, we can demand separation of church and state, and we can ensure that no one person's beliefs will in any way negatively affect our everyday lives.  Once that's been accomplished though (or if those concepts are moot, such as in this particular situation) then we have very little right to get involved with another person's life.

And I mentioned neglect, beating, and food not as things I disagree with (although I do) but rather as examples of ways in which overly religious parents can (and have) been abusive to their children.  My point was that if their personal belief system wasn't endangering the child, then we don't have much recourse to stop them from doing what they want.

I would also add ""healing through prayer"" to that list, though.  That is child abuse plain and simple.  ","1293840007"

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","So, since the land within the borders of Texas is also located in Texas, I can assume you also ignore that too?  You really let the idea you have of people ruin an entire state for you?

People who say what you do have no idea how much better the rest of the state is compared to your opinion.  The people throughout Texas are far more kind to strangers than you think, even if you are someone who looks strange.  Seeing the *entire rest of the state* through a political lense doesn't make you sound too sharp.

I'm not exactly liberal or conservative, strictly speaking.  I prefer to think for myself.  I've found just as much intolerance among liberals as I have among conservatives, and, when people here in Austin consign the rest of the state to some sort of heap of irrelevance because it's not what they want it to be, it's the same as the conservatives who actively maintain narrow-minded opinions.  You are no different.

Having actually grown up in and traveled throughout other parts of the state, and lived in most of the major cities, I can safely say your opinion is based on some truly flimsy thinking.  Even when I was a punk rock kid wearing chains in my younger days, the friendliest people I remember meeting were rarely in Dallas, San Antonio, or Austin.  I've met as many douchebags in Dallas and Austin as I have throughout the rest of the state.

Don't be afraid.  There are some very conservative people in the middle of nowhere in this state who would treat you pretty much like family just because you all crossed paths.  That's not political action.  It's just simple decency and kindness.  There's nothing quite like meeting people of all kinds, many of whom are quite different from ourselves, but who also do not emotionally or willfully make themselves think of us strictly as political entities, but instead simply think of us as people.  Nobody is perfect, of course, but you would be surprised how often you would find such people in places you would not expect it.

Some names being thrown around as replacements for next year are Josh McDaniels (I would like this if he could get along with Haley, the guy is a great OC) and Nick Sirianni, the Chiefs current offensive quality control guy, who is supposedly being groomed for the job. Others think that Haley might take over the OC and HC jobs again, but his comments from earlier in the season prove otherwise (talked about the huge stress relief from not having two jobs).

See [Clerical Fascism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_fascism) for the links between religion and fascist movements. 

The Catholic Church was also [instrumental in helping prominent and wanted Nazis to flee to South America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratlines_%28history%29#The_Roman_ratlines) after the War as it also did with Croatian Fascists - who, it could be argued, outdid the Nazis in cruelty and violence. 

The Nazis certainly found broad support from large sections of the Catholic Church which also profited greatly from the [Church Tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax#Germany) which I am sure played no part in it's refusal to condemn the Nazi regime.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This is proving to be a bit of an uphill battle. I have three handicaps:

* You are very skeptical/critical, you really really don't want to be convinced of this, I think;
* This particular topic is not one I'm well practiced at, I'm hardly a champion at this; and
* Harris kinda pulls things together but as you've noticed he hasn't just done something totally amazing like squaring the circle.

Still, the old college try. Thank you for being very civil and giving me a chance to blunder along here.

In the background, as I've meanwhile learned, were such classic philosophies as hedonism and utilitarianism. Hedonism is my personal favorite: It says, if I like it it must be good. This provides a unit of measure, though a mediocre one. Then there's utilitarianism: This says that one should try to achieve the maximum amount of good for everyone, but forgets to define what the measure for that good should be. Apparently it's possible to combine the two, so hedonistic utilitarianism seems to have been considered as a system for defining morality. Pleasing everybody is a reasonable start. One problem with this is that, especially with modern neuroscience, it's possible to make people extremely happy while totally screwing them over. That way lie various drugs, as well as wires in the brain. There's a sad tale of a little monkey they gave this button to, he kept pushing the button and ended up starving, but at least he died happy.

So by moving from simple pleasure (= hedonism) to well-being, Harris is introducing (or maybe just affirming) a sensible unit of measurement. We can take well-being to mean that not only is a person reasonably happy, but also he's not cruising toward some future ruin, he's not unhealthy and so forth. He's prospering, by any sensible standards. By spreading it out over all sentient beings, he's basically doing utilitarianism and extending it to animals too.

You claim this isn't new. I disagree; you're comparing Harris' ""system"" to what you and your common sense might come up with, and they're probably not far off from one another. Harris and his standards are, however, a radical improvement against the current moral standards of our societies. If you don't believe this, consider the huge body of horribly draconian laws that society applies to sexuality. There are all kinds of acts that harm nobody yet result (in the US) in being placed on the Sex Offenders' Registry, with an accompanying possible loss of home and livelihood, severe restrictions on freedom and so forth. Do you remember the outrage when Janet Jackson had a ""wardrobe malfunction?"" Nothing happened, and a whole damn country went nuts. Sex-related laws are one example of totally arbitrary, religiously mandated morals being applied instead of morals aligned with well-being. Sensible morals might result in legalizing pot, for example, as it turns out to be rather harmless.

You mention that the word ""morality"" has meanings that stretch far beyond suffering and well-being. That's exactly what's wrong with morals as they work today. ""Morals"" encompasses a whole lot of useless shit, much of it from religion. This is the ""revolutionary"" idea: Worry about people doing well, and forget about all the complicated arbitrary junk baggage!

You mention the burqa, and it so happens that Harris does too. A burqa is hot and heavy and restrictive, it limits a woman's movement and vision. No sane, un-brainwashed woman would freely elect to wear one, so why should she? There is no harm in her showing her face, neither to her nor anybody else. The only group who do it are the Muslims, and this is a pretty sure sign that it's one of those arbitrary religion-imposed morals. Trash it, and women will be better off. Harris says that, all else being equal, it's perfectly clear that a society that forces women to dress up in trash bags is worse than one that doesn't. I find this argument very easy to follow.

Moving right along to abortion. Science informs us that hardly anything is as worthless as a fresh embryo. We're talking about a tiny cluster of cells here, with less ""life"" than a worm or a tadpole, that needs to spend months being the parasite of a woman before it becomes a small human. No, an embryo is *not* a human, any more than an egg is a chicken. When I say ""worthless"" I don't mean to be disparaging. What I do mean is that the value people associate with these cell clumps is not only completely out of proportion with their human-ness, it's even completely out of proportion with their chance of ever attaining human-ness. It turns out, so I've read, that about half of all pregnancies *ever* end up aborting, for various little biological reasons, before the woman even knows she's pregnant. In discussions where God is part of the topic, it is often said that God is the biggest of all abortionists. Take God back out of the picture, and you have a reproductive system that is marked by a huge amount of waste and redundancy. The reproductive system is remarkably fragile, and things keep going wrong for purely natural reasons. So a ""fresh"" embryo can't be considered of much value because it has so little potential of ever becoming a fully developed human.

You cringe at the idea of destroying a potential human life. My take on it is this: Until it's a living, conscious, breathing human being, it's not alive. It's nothing more than a funky cyst in the mother's body. Embryos are incredibly cheap and plentiful, if the mother does not want the baby then it has no value even to the mother, they are not sentient so terminating them does not cause any suffering. It's a far greater tragedy to bring a child to term against the wishes of its mother, who ends up in economic dire straits, has trouble adequately caring for the child and ends up raising an underprivileged child in impoverished conditions. Let that same woman raise the child 5 years later, when she has the resources and the time, and you have a thriving, prospering, successful child. It's a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned. Similarly, if she can adequately take care of 2 children but not 4, then if she doesn't abort that makes the difference between 2 thriving children and 4 growing up in squalor and poverty. This is no muddle, it's very clear cut. The cool thing is, you don't even have to worry about rights and cost/benefit ratios any more. On one side you have *no* human, on the other you have a human and his family living badly. Dead easy.

A question that will need some resolution is the priority balance between death and suffering. Personally, if I was faced with months of suffering with no improvement in sight, I would quickly choose to die. I consider a suffering self much worse than a dead self. Other people seem to have vastly different priorities: They would prefer to live as a vegetable, or in horrible pain, just so long as they are allowed to live. This doesn't make sense to me, but it's a question that wants to be addressed, surely.

This probably won't convince you, but it may make at least my standpoint (and I hope I've represented Harris' reasonably well) a little more clear.","1293840146"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I have some job search advice, as a guy who spent a year looking for decent work with no real experience or unusual skills. Temp agencies! 

If you interview with the agency and explain your situation (hours workable, lack of transportation) they'll let you know when they have jobs available that fit your skills and can often get you the jobs without additional interviews/applications. Easy data entry 6pm-8pm, light (less than 25 pounds) loading and unloading trucks 5am-8am, and being a receptionist 12pm-1pm are examples of jobs I did as a temp. Eventually I got a temp job where they hired me permanently and have since had a couple of substantial raises.

Temp agencies don't care if you turn down work offers, as long as you get back to them promptly and explain why (too far away, etc.). If you get on the regular lists for a few temp agencies you can be in a position to turn stuff down instead of being rejected yourself. Even if you never take any of those jobs it helps your confidence to get calls offering you stuff.

My wife applied for a job a while back and was rejected. A few months later the company asked a Temp agency for a temp to cover the job until they found someone, and she showed up. Within a week the company decided they'd hire her as soon as her term with the temp agency was up, and she's been there for almost two years.","1293840167"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Since this is for your personal interest, you can do this without the inherent backwardness that most school curricula seem to employ.

Start from the beginning: What is Science? This would involve looking into the classics of rational thought and the scientific method, starting with history (personally, I think the Greek philosophers are where it really got going). A good source for any of these: check out the books people are recommending herein.

Next, you can sample the basics of some key fields. This distinction is, I suppose, well done in High School the world over: Biology, Physics, Chemistry. But also, the social sciences provide an interesting use for the scientific method. That's more of a college topic, though.

Biology: There is a LOT of material in this field, and HS seems to approach it by forcing a tonne of specific memorization. I'd start with the fundamentals. Genetics, phylogeny, and their culmination into evolution (my second favourite science topic). Then you might branch out into the more specific stuff like biochemistry or neurology (my third favourite topic).

Physics/Chemistry: This subject has a rich history that underscores how we mingle thought with process in science. You can follow history from Galileo through Newton for basic dynamics, and then see how thinking outside the box can yield theories that adapt long-""understood"" laws into a greater framework with Einstein's Special and General Relativity (my personal favourite subjects in Physics). On the other hand, you can explore how we've historically modeled matter, starting with the 4 elements, and then with the advent of science and reason discovering more and more, and eventually arriving at the Bohr model for the atom, but then moving on and finally coming to quantum mechanics. Understand these can let you branch out into things like Astronomy/Astrophysics.

I think you are going to have a lot of fun reading up on this stuff!","1293840190"

OP also claims to have worked for a few separate labels and have run his own ""successful"" labels, to me that sounds like no label wanted to keep him around for long enough to start to make any serious business and after failing has tried to start his own label.

Since this *is* a AMA, are you a troll or a failed music industry executive? 

To answer your question MrMatters, when you hear a song has gone platinum it is the same thing, the artist and label get the platinum and if a single store (lets just say big bobs records) sells enough for platinum the owner will also receive the award, which might sound rare, but most stores are big chains (in Canada we have HMV for example) and my old man ran stores in Ontario called Cheapies (over 25 years ago, before I was born) with about 14 stores and has won multiple gold/platinum records.","1293840203"

It might just come down to the individual members of your tribe, or the weather that year.

A lot of anthropologists that defend the idea of the noble savage do and did so for political and ideological reasons. It was a sharp reaction to the idea of 'constant progress', and a flag taken up by the feminist and hippy movements. That's part of the reason I stand strongly against it. I don't know if it's false, but it bothers me to see people accepting it as unquestionably true.

And you can solve that horrible situation where you kill the spy but the engie is dead, so you have to watch as the sentry, tele, and dispensor die from sappers before your eyes.
Also, if you're a pyro who barely uses melee, this is the best choice, since you can treat it like a sapper remover rather than a weapon.

I don't like the powerjack.  In any situation I'd be using it, the axestinguisher is better.  If they're at nearly full health, it will take a few powerjack hits and you may die.  If they're near full health, the axestinguisher crit is much more worthwhile.  I could only see the powerjack as really useful when you're not really using a flamethrower, but how often is that?

I have not used the Backscratcher yet.

The standard fireaxe I never use.  Again, when are you generally engaging in melee when you haven't just set your opponent on fire?  When you're out of ammo or engaging an enemy pyro.  If you're out of ammo, it's a desperate situation anyway, and not worth planning for.  And if I'm fighting another pyro close range, flamethrower without afterburn is still my preference.","1293840242"

On what basis can one argue that? A human being, a dog and a fish would all shun pain stimuli like electric shocks. Can one measurably claim that the dog or fish suffer less from those pain stimuli than the human being?

You also (seem to) make the assumption that suffering is dependent on brain complexity and/or neurological development, but what if suffering is more dependent on the sensors in the body than neurological development? Some animals have more sensors and more sensitive sensors in their bodies than human beings. Do those animals suffer less when pain stimuli are applied to them because their brain is smaller?

Two things: I can't think of an example in recent memory where a handwritten font has worked out well.  (But as I've demonstrated ;) I'm not a designer so I don't really keep that sort of thing in memory.)

Also, dominating the front page with a word-of-the-day is what Urban Dictionary does.  Though I started my site a couple years before UD, I'd worry about appearing to rip off their design.

Do you think a word-of-the-day is more interesting than what's currently the ""highlight"": recently added definitions?

I don't really understand this feedback.  There are several other ways to navigate (by date, word list, thesaurus, search) so clicking through the alphabet sequentially is just one option.  Maybe the other navigation methods are overshadowed by the alphabetical navigation?

Only two bad things he could do with it would be (a) hoard it for future generations, or (b) pay much of it in taxes (much of which would probably go to invading other countries).

And for those who say 'hoarding' is actually putting the cash into banks which then loan the money to businesses, and that this is somehow good - no, it isn't.  All it really amounts to is another tax on entrepreneurs (in the form of interest payments to the bank).   Far better for the small businesses if the money was just spent on their products directly.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Well, I guess I think you should read the book before you judge it.  

Regarding cultural relativists: they are everywhere, and they are frequently powerful.  Critics of Islam routinely meet left-wing opposition that claims exactly that ""that is just their way.""   I've personally heard college-educated American liberals defend genital mutilation, suicide bombing, burkas, and pedophilia on such grounds.  They think they are supposed to, because, there being no God, morality is just whatever a particular culture decides it is.  

The encounter that specifically inspired Harris to write the book was one in which some woman who is on a special committee for bioethics appointed by Obama (or something) was calling him out for claiming that it may be objectively true that forcing women to wear burkas is not the best way to maximize human well-being.  So Harris upped the ante to clarify what she meant, and suggested as a thought experiment a hypothetical culture that blinded every third child for religious reasons.  She claimed that so long as it was done for religious reasons, it could not be said to be morally wrong.  This is bizarre, but then it really isn't that unusual if you spend any time around humanities scholars.  Seriously.  Those people will say anything, and they are often the lawyers, politicians, and educators who help decide our course as a society.  Cultural relativism is taken as an article of ""faith"" by many in the academy, and Harris is ruffling a lot of feathers by challenging them from within their own tradition.  

You seem to find it not particularly revelatory that moral questions could be answered by science, but many people, including many scientists, harbor an unexamined conviction that science ought not to have any opinion whatsoever on questions of morality.  This is precisely why Harris's book is so controversial.  People are not reacting to it merely with yawns and bewilderment at his unoriginality.  They are outraged.  In fact, many people in the atheist community are upset by Harris's book because they prefer to take for granted Gould's notion of ""non-overlapping magisteria.""  As Gould says, ""The net of science covers the empirical universe: what is it made of (fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The net of religion extends over questions of moral meaning and value. These two magisteria do not overlap.""  This is the kind of thinking that informs much of the ""accomodationist"" camp in the internecine debates among atheists.  Harris is calling them out on it.  

So, no, I don't give much credit to your anxiety that any positive press given to Harris by atheists will be spun by theists as evidence of our groupthink mentality.  (Please.)  ","1293840286"

Please approach this from a position of wanting to help her.  She isn't likely to accept your criticism if that is all you get across.   This lifestyle isn't what she wants and it isn't good for the family as a whole, so she needs professional counseling to help.

It's absolutely worth the time and money to get her into counseling.  Talk to her about how much you believe that things can be better, and how you believe that she isn't as ""happy as she deserves to be.""

Let her speak to you about any grievances she may have.  They aren't relevant at the moment, but it will help for her to have you open to listening before she goes to speak with a professional.

I'm not saying she needs to be medicated, but that she CLEARLY isn't happy with everything and doesn't know how to set things right.

Michael still dreams of space flight, but the world and its possibilities are much diminished due to environmental degradation. The gifted teen has studied Michael's life, for the Poole family played a pivotal role in creating the human future, and thus her world. Through seemingly supernatural apparitions, Alia bridges time to communicate with Michael as they determine the future of humanity.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_healthcare_software

*Thoughts to ponder:*

* **Conversion Costs** It sounds like you are in a relatively small shop.  I am basing this on your not using a web client with a central server.  It sounds like everybody is running fat stand alone clients.  Is that the case?  Anyway, I think you need an assessment of what it would take to switch medical software applications.  Even if you went the open source route, it will take time and materials to do a conversion.  Like others have said, I would not consider running anything under WINE.

* **Red Hat &amp; Open Source Replacement** -- Do any of the open source replacements have conversion experience with your current software?  References please? 

* **Red Hat** -- They are big boys and are now part of the S&amp;P 500.  

* **Business Case** -- I would ask for a business case of total cost of ownership.  I would include risks of records being corrupted or stolen from a compliance and reputational risk perspective.  Some of the numbers will be easily quantifiable -- other won't.  But a ""numbers"" approach -- I would think -- would be a necessary part of the case. ","1293840370"

The ice is smooth and clear and you really can't even see anything beneath your feet, so it's almost like floating.  The ice can be that clear and you're just up there upon a floating void.  The ice skating in our lake was amazing, up to 12 miles in some directions and nothing but clear, smooth ice.

You can see right through the ice, it's like glass.  I could see fish swimming beneath and ripples in the sand.  Once you got out into deeper water (i.e. &gt; 5 feet), is when you got that floating feeling.

My mom has some photos when ice skating where the ice has turned into a rainbow in the sun.  Unbelievable.  Also, the ice sings.  When it expands, it sounds like a cross between a humpback whale and a piece of sheet metal.  No kidding.  The ice will start to sing as soon as the sun goes below the trees and will keep it up all night, so loud that you can hear it in the house sometimes.  It only occurs when the ice is a certain thickness, so when the lake is freezing over, up to say 12-15"" and then in the spring at the ice starts to thin, but still refreezes at night.

My ghetto workaround is to include multiple instances of Glitch and automate the 'enabled/disabled' toggle.  Or it might have been the mix knob, could be either one, or both.

I do use Glitch quite a bit nowadays - even for relatively 'benign' uses.  I tend to have multiple instances with each instance 'simplified' where it only engages a single effect with a single pattern.  I create automation patterns to toggle each instance and score out the glitchiness in the ... urh... pattern score thingy, I'll have patterns like 'FX MidSyn Shuff On' and 'FX MidSyn Shuff Off', or whatever.

So [here's proof in the pudding](http://soundcloud.com/james_filter/that-new-sound-9-fix-64/s-bWaXd).  You'll notice the 'bed track' is just version 9, but I made an additional 64 versions to try to figure out how to successfully automate Glitch.  It's not a particularly good track but you'll be familiar with the Glitchiness.

You have no experience being without shoes, so who's the confused one? Regarding the carpet, I've told you, every house I've entered hasn't cared one way or the other. So simply put, if someone asked me to put something on, I would. I'm not rude. But personally, I'd rather have a barefoot come in on my white carpet, as opposed to having someone that regularly wears shoes taking them off and having that stink in my carpet. I don't argue with people about the rules regarding their own homes. That, again, would be rude. I do feel being barefoot is superior, and that shoes, like gloves, are a tool. Would you wear gloves all day long? I think not. If I were hot-mopping a roof I'd wear shoes. You've pretty much ignored or neglected to respond to my positions on why it IS superior. I've even left things on the table and waited for the obvious questions of why I think that shoes are physically bad for you, but no questions were forthcoming. I thought I explained the ""you people"" remark. No offense was intended. I was simply saying that because I've run into several people who were, like I said before, misinformed. One last thing.....you did ignore what I said about bare feet being clean, about the only thing sticking to my feet was the stray wet piece of grass.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","And believe it or not the US killed civilians during Vietnam, the Korean War, WWII, WWI, the Spanish American War, the Civil War, Mexican American war, the War of 1812 and the American Revolution.  It might not seem possible, but civilians die in wars.  Its also might be hard to believe but other countries outside of the US also have killed civilians.  I know it blows the mind that when artillery shells, rifle rounds, grenades and rockets are going of that they are not set up to only kill combatants.

As to killing a hell of a lot innocent civilians as you state, you have to look at the context and when it occurred.  Was there an artillery round that went astray and hit a building during the war?  What about the clearing of Faluah?  Then you have to ask yourself about the Sunni and Shiite death squads that are actually killing a hell of a lot of innocent civilians in Iraq.  Whose the bigger threat?  

Americans now acting as police or religious idiots whose going out and systematically slaughtering people who wear the wrong hat?

Trust me, I'd rather see all Americans immediately pulled out of Iraq as of yesterday.  However the sectarian bloodbath that would result makes that an impossibility.  If there is one thing a Muslim hates more than a crusaders its someone who wears the wrong hat and not following their exact same belief structure.

By hat, I'm talking about religion.  Its the stupidest thing to kill a person for, but its going on like you would not believe in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan right now.

So no, the US has not killed a ton of innocent civilians deliberately.  Shiite and Sunnis on the other hand in Iraq have killed a shit load of innocent civilians in Iraq.","1293840457"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Game reviewers put themselves in a much more difficult position with a 100-point scale than with, say, a 4- or 5-star system. When you believe a game is mediocre, it would in theory get around a 50. But then there's a whole 50 points or so that you're not giving to the game, and you have to explain it. Easier to just kick it up another 20 points so that you don't look so mean-spirited. With a 5-star system, meanwhile, giving a game only two or three stars is fine if the game isn't that great. People just don't perceive it the same way.

Is it proper? Of course not. The whole 100-point system is a hackneyed mistake. Metascores are the fucking devil. I'm just saying that the prevalence of ridiculously granular scoring is why verdicts get inflated.","1293840457"

While he was never charged with a DUI, nor proven that he had been drinking, the other passenger in the car [alleged that Freeman was intoxicated](http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/25/morgan-freeman-sued-car-crash/) and later sued him.  The case was [settled out-of-court](http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE5A46E420091105) and the judge dismissed the lawsuit.  
  

Now, I'm not a lawyer, but if you ask me it sounds like this woman was clearly trying to take advantage of a tragedy and extort money.  If Freeman had been intoxicated, surely the Mississippi police would have uncovered that information.

I agree with undergroundbastard in that I'd prefer an alternative to the inner light-blue background.  The problem is that there's a ton of other content that would have to mesh well with it - see e.g. http://onlineslangdictionary.com/definition+of/upboat#vulgarity and lower on the page.

Also, as I mentioned elsewhere, I'm hesitant to dominate the front page with a word-of-the-day.  Urban Dictionary does this, and I don't want to make my site look like a rip-off of his.  There are several other classes of words (newly updated, most popular, most vulgar, most searched...) that I could use instead, though...

EDIT: Oh, and I love the ""big front-and-center search box.""  Unfortunately, stupid Google Custom Search Engine (which I use for the site) doesn't let you change the size or styling of the search box.

If you pick up the skills to do that, which is totally independent of any employment history you've had, then you can get another job.

It took another set of geniuses to make everyone want a ""stable"" job, instead of just working for themselves, as everyone but slaves/indentured servants used to.  It helps that land is closely zoned as well.  :)

Anyway, I think unions are overrated for this purpose, because they are for low-skilled workers who need to move together and dont have job mobility.  There could certainly be a place for unions in the industry, but for highly skilled workers it would be a major drag to have some behemoth trying to help us out, when we're capable of moving around to a better position anyway.

There is a lot to be said for independence, once you can get it.  If you cant, better to have strength in numbers.","1293840515"

There seem to be 2 major improvements to the battery for me.  For one, the battery icon now has an exact percentage of battery left, which I find really nice.  This came with Myn's, not the new Kernel.

Second major improvement (and the main reason I would recommend a custom ROM and kernel) is standby battery life. The stock Evo will still burn through the battery when it is on and idle, mostly through widgets and such that access the internet on a regular basis (Friendstream, Facebook, Twitter, etc).  However, with the custom ROM alone you will notice standby battery usage is considerably lessened.  With both the customr ROM and kernel, you can easily go an 8 hour night with your battery dropping 3% total.

Further, some kernels don't have the battery calibrated right for whatever reason, and even though the phone is fully charged, it will drop the battery from 100%-&gt;80% in a matter of minutes.  The netarchy kernel seems to combat this the best, and will allow the phone to hover at 100% for a lot longer, and not plummet right after. ","1293840537"

2) The appearance of a trait in a population does not have to be advantageous - it simply has to not be selected against.  In any genetic population, you'll get a bunch of different traits.  Some will be selected against, and they'll fail to produce progeny that carry on their traits, while the individuals without those traits go on.  This would be a dandy route of explanation except...

3) ...we haven't found any evidence that homosexuality is linked to a gene or set of genes.  It doesn't seem to be hereditary.  Homosexuality and heterosexuality don't seem to be passed from parents to children, at all.  So, it's a kind of nonsense to be talking about homosexuality in evolutionary terms.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The act of walking with a vessel of gear and supplies on one’s back has been around for thousands and thousands of years and within the past few decades has slowly began to evolve into the world of lightweight backpacking as we know it today. Lightweight backpacking is exactly the same as traditional backpacking, only with smaller and lighter gear. These changes may be as drastic as switching from a tent to a tarp or as simple as carrying half an ounce of soap (or none at all) instead of two or four. Lightweight backpacking offers a more enjoyable experience in the back country by delivering a safer, easier trek with more time for enjoying the surroundings which is, after all, the reason we do this in the first place.
Lightweight backpacking gear has come a long way in a relatively short amount of time. It’s been a long time since the days of canvas and steel, and now such things as aluminum and nylon are deemed as “heavy”. But still, every little bit of weight that is left at home rather than bag is using that item’s potential one hundred percent. If you can survive comfortably and still enjoy the outdoors experience without a particular item than why bring it in the first place? It’s weight is best left for the shelves to carry, not your feet.
Of course, gear is only a tool, and what is a tool without worthy hands to wield it?
Developing crucial skills is critical in properly utilizing that lightweight gear to it’s maximum capabilities. Gaining knowledge is always a good first step in preparing for trips and backpacking treks, but the skills can only be acquired through good old experience. This could be as easy as (and is strongly recommended if it’s the first time) setting up your new super lightweight backpacking tarp in your very own backyard, just to get a feel for how to properly stake it out. simply using gear is the best method for gaining experience and skills and for that, there is no better place to be than the great outdoors.
Lightening the load could be a lot easier said than done for some people, who are reluctant to part with some of their gear, claiming how it’s riddled with fond memories (and dead weight). But for those who are willing to make a few relatively drastic changes to their trail life, the rewards can be… well.. Rewarding!
Uncover the myths of traditional hiking and the backpacking gear market and companies who would love to have you believe that without their gear, your trip would be doomed. How would traversing such rugged terrain even be conceivable without Gore-tex and leather. If eighty year old ladies can hike thousands miles with tennis shoes and a purse than it’s probably at least possible if not probable that even you could do it!
Lightweightbackpacking.org aims to be a tool that can be wielded by both the new hiker aiming to shed a few pounds and the crafty trekker whose goal weight is within ounces. On this site we’ll discuss lightweight stoves, lightweight cooksystems, lightweight tents and tarps, lightweight backpacks, lightweight hydrations systems and all the lightweight tips and tricks you’ll need to lighten the load.

Whether you are going for a short one night lightweight backpacking adventure, or trying to complete a long thru hike everything you need to know is right here and waiting for you to put it into practice.","1293840552"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I won't argue many of these points. I would never suggest anyone consume a diet containing -no- carbohydrates at all.

And the problem with the calorie deficit hypothesis is that no, you will not lose an average of a pound a week over time. That's the precise problem.

From the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports Medicine, published jointly:

“It is reasonable to assume that persons with relatively high daily energy expenditures would be less likely to gain weight over time, compared with those who have low energy expenditures. So far, data to support this hypothesis are not particularly compelling.” 

One of the most basic assumptions of diet and exercise is not demonstrable scientifically. In other words, maintaining a caloric deficit has never been linked in studies to show that it promotes weight loss or even deters weight gain. This is with over 50 years of studies trying to link physical activity and calorie deficit to weight management.

""Not particularly compelling"" is another way of saying ""most likely wrong""

Meaning, something makes people fat other than the calories they eat vs. calories burned. It sounds crazy because it runs contrary to the first law of thermodynamics (on the surface) but is still true.

The most likely hypothesis which takes it's place is that varying levels of insulin in the bloodstream moderate body fat. This explains much more easily how some people eat tons of carbs and stay skinny and every other diet and body size combination.

Making it very reasonable, I think, to assume that if she's fat and mostly eat carbs, that a good first diet to try would be low carb.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","I didn't downvote you, but it's an uncomfortable truth.  Unfortunately people can be pretty harsh when it comes to bad news like this, but it's only because the tech world is harsh and unforgiving in and of itself.

RAID controllers don't all work the same way, and that's why one controller's array might not be recognised in another.  With implementations like 0, 3, 5, and 6, the data on the drives is unintelligible until the controller works to figure it out.

RAID 1 is a lot different since all drives in the array are identical, so while you'd probably still have to rebuild, I don't think you'd lose any data. 

I could imagine that, as long as you stay within the same brand and model, the new controller would recognise the array.  I've heard of people switching motherboards after using the integrated chipset RAID, and as long as the chipsets were similar (same Silicon Image controller, for example) the new controller picked up the array without issue.

But if you're trying to go from a HighPoint to an LSI, or a Silicon Image to an Adaptec, or whatever, I really don't think you're going to keep your data.

Instead, you'd have to reconnect the old computer and backup the data, presuming you haven't already re-initialised the drives in the new controller, and thus lost everything.

Good luck, brodiddly.","1293840566"

You really have to go back to the feeling of what it was like before you were married, feeling about a guy you were dating. It's really tough to (in effect) start over and dating this guy is kind of a easy way out, but it's really not the best course for you. You need to re-establish yourself to a state of personal appreciation to which you can then devote part of yourself to someone else. It's kinda like cheating your emotions. You really need to go through the 5 stages of grief (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief), because your marriage essentially died. You need to finally accept it and move on, and cheating your emotions by staying with a guy you shouldn't be staying with is not the way to do that.

Easy, prep is fast, you can have dipping oils with bread.  And it is tasty.  Also it is impressive because you can have the candles and such while she enjoys wine and you do the prep and talk.


2 large chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips. (i find slightly freezing it helps to make the cuts thinner)

Heat a good 3/4-1 cup of olive oil with 1 stick of butter in the pan.  Slowly heat it up, medium to medium high heat
Throw in black pepper, a pinch or two of basil, oregano and a clove or two of crushed garlic.

When the garlic is cooking, put in the chicken.  stir around until cooked and tender.  Toss in a bunch of sliced scallions (dont use the entire onion, but a good halfway into the green is nice)

Stir a bit, serve with the oil/butter sauce over fettuccine

"singularity","t5_2qh8m","It really comes down to definition.  If you have an anthropomorphic view of intelligence and you want something that will understand language and emotion as we do, something that would easily interface with people as they are today, than you'll need something of a mix with a lot of top-down design based on the brain.  If your definition of intelligence is along the lines of ""acting to maximize reward across a wide range of environments"" then bottom-up is the way to go.

Personally I like the later definition for being more general and formalizable.  I don't want to completely discard the ""human"" definition of intelligence.  I'd rather distinguish the two as separate goals.  The first I call EQ (emotional quotient) and the second IQ.
 
For EQ, the more I study machine learning, neuroscience, and evolution, the more I think it will have to be a combination of top-down and bottom-up systems (for mainstream definitions of intelligence).  A lot of brain areas dealing with our senses and emotions, and how they are processed are top-down systems; while areas where information is integrated like the cortex appear to be more of bottom-up design.

For IQ I should mention things like [AIXI](http://www.hutter1.net/ai/aixigentle.htm), which is a theoretical model for an optimally intelligent, but uncomputable AI.  And [MC-AIXI](http://www.vetta.org/2009/09/monte-carlo-aixi/) a computable approximation to AIXI.  These are pure bottom-up models *theoretically* capable of learning to act optimally in any environment.  MC-AIXI has shown a lot of promising results, but we still need more computing power.","1293840641"

"science","t5_mouw","Well my point above is that there's a difference between having certain set-in-stone physical characteristics and being an ""omnivore"" in the dietary sense. The other posters are conflating the two concepts. We evolved eating a small amount of meat and since that's what our ancestors did, genes were selected for those who did it well, hence all the secondary characteristics. Animals that didn't need the overhead of digesting meat had that capacity selected against. Those who made it part of their diet had that capacity selected for, etc.

If it were set in stone like they're trying to make it sound, this whole discussion would sound a lot [like this one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBNzYpCBnfg).

"trees","t5_2r9vp","A close friend of mine was just diagnosed with ADD and started taking Adderall, and he said it's pretty much fixed everything that was ever wrong with him (kind of an exaggerated claim, I know). It all makes sense though. The past few years he was on medication for bipolar disorder, depression, psychosis, schizophrenia, etc. In reality, he just has very severe ADD, and is also obsessive compulsive, which is a ridiculous combination. 

Think of it like this: Your mind is a roulette table. The numbers on it are different thoughts. The ball is constantly spinning, but at any given time, it can stop. Anywhere.

So if I'm at work, for example, and my thoughts are constantly racing in every direction. I'll be talking to a coworker named David. David and Danielle begin with the letter ""D."" I cheated on my girlfriend with a girl named Danielle four years ago. It was the biggest mistake of my life. Wow, I'm an asshole. I wonder if the world would be better off without me? If I killed myself, who would I leave notes for? Who would get my stuff? How would I kill myself? Where would I do? When? How would I get there? What would be my last thought before I died? I feel like I should die because I don't make anybody happy. I remember when I was 18, I failed out of college because I had a coke and drinking problem. I'm a pretty shitty human being. 

^^^^^

This is literally the thought process of someone on ADD. I know, because me and my friend have gone through a LOT of similar things in the time we've known each other, we both went to the same high school, similar social circles, similar relationship experiences, we both failed out of college, we both do a lot of hallucinogens, usually by ourselves and for the purpose of thinking, (and we both get fucked up ideas of cause-and-effect, try to understand how the world works, etc.), and of course, we both use cannabis. Maybe I'm just jumping on the bandwagon, but I'm going to a doctor soon to try to get Adderall too, because I feel like it might seriously help me. He's the one who gave me a few pills to try out, because he thought it would help me. And no, I didn't crush and rail them like an idiot. I took an extended release every day for a few days, as if I WERE prescribed them already, and for those few days I did feel a lot better. 

tl;dr: In some cases, being depressed is just your mind uncontrollably obsessing over negative things. Either that, or I'm hopelessly fucked up and in denial. 

And on a sidenote, the roulette table example is hypothetical; I didn't cheat on my girlfriend or anything like that. It's just a way to show how my thought process works.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I think my parents found out when she was several months old. The doctor didn't think she would even talk (a laughable thought now). Our childhood has been amazing. I remember her having physical and speech therapy. The therapists came to our house, and they were usually in their twenties, and I thought they were so cool. I always wanted to be around them. They actually included me in activities a lot, and it was always fun! Many of them have become close family friends over the years even though my sister hasn't seen a therapist in about a decade.
One thing that was amazing about my childhood - and I think may be unique in many families - is that I never felt that my parents preferred my sister, or dedicated more attention to her. We were always valued and paid attention to equally, and as a result we've always had a very harmonious and loving relationship.
We were also lucky in our unique school experience. In high school, my sister got to know a lot of my friends, but also made many of her own. She has a wicked sense of humor, though she can be difficult to understand. She got involved in a lot of extracurriculars (managing the basketball team, starting a jewelry business, horseback riding, and a support club for students with and without disabilities). We've also worked to get her in as many general education classes as possible, so that she would be known and accepted by her peers. We went to a high school of about 2000, and it's unusually accepting (theater is as popular as sports, gay students are popular...you get the idea). Now in her senior year, she's really thrived socially (one key to this was getting a facebook page). My senior year, we both took the same Earth Science class (you could take it any year of high school for credit). We could do homework together, made the same friends in the class, and all around had a blast.
It's funny you mention bonding, because whenever we spend quality time together we call it ""sister bonding."" When we were younger we loved fishing and catching frogs, and now when I visit from college we always go to the movies and the mall. The jewelry business I mentioned we actually started together, and that was also fantastic.","1293840675"

It should be noted: Cincinatti is NOT ALONE in having a police culture of violence and racism.  I believe these national patterns suggest racial intolerance and general indifference to suffering are promoted, or at least overlooked. These things divide people and create fear, not respect for the cops.  

Racist hatred also stops people from banding together against their TRUE common enemy: the greedy banking cartels, corrupt politicians, and uncaring corporations who have sold our country away.  And still are...

In terms of our survival as a nation, and even more broadly, as humans, we must realize that black, white, and every skin color in between, are meaningless. We are all united by our humanity.

There are only rich and poor now, and the gap between them grows.  Know your enemies.  

TL;DR - IMO Racism is overlooked or even promoted to keep people from banding together and stopping govt and corporations from abusing us.

Kids, it's a fact of life.  Intellectuals and intelligent people are very often wrong about quite simple questions.  Maher however is an intellectual because he remains curious about new ideas and he is always trying to challenge himself and his audience to not take old ideas for granted.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I'm guessing from the confusion and the lack of upvotes, not many understand this comic. This one actually made me shed tears of longing.

The end reveals that it was an epilogue of Link's Awakening.  It shows that after all the years that Link has lived, he longed to come back to Koholint Island which he discovered after a shipwreck. This is an impossibility though because once you leave the island, you can never return. [The Island turns out to be a dream that Link can't awake from without breaking a curse within his dream, the problem is that the world is so fun and beautiful that you don't want to leave. Once you awaken, the island will vanish forever.](/spoiler)

The final panels show that Link is embarking on another suicide mission in attempt to find the island again.  A pipe dream if you've beaten the game.  After the storm, the girl that appears at the end is Marin from the island, meaning that Link has finally found Koholint island again.  Possibly his final resting place.

Those who haven't played Link's Awakening won't be able to draw the same feelings as those of us who have beaten the game.  This has been a true masterpiece of a game with a world that is so fun that you'll spend countless hours exploring and wandering in even if you are almost at the end.  Collecting seashells, bumping into every tree, throwing chickens, chopping every shrubbery, and whistling your way around the world, it's a sandbox paradise.

My problem is not with making life better for women so they can have running water, or access to health care, my problem comes further down the line. From what I know of the dark side of female nature and how much power it possesses.

Quite honestly, I question why women are given the political right to vote.

Women have overwhelming power in the social sphere. Women control men, not the other way around. Even in patriarchy, men work for women. Women didnt work down mines, or do dangerous jobs. And this idea that women have been oppressed, well so have men, but men as a group, even under patriarchy have tried to do their best for their women. Women do also have access to politics through their husbands.

My view is, that once you give women the political right to vote, you then have a major imbalance of power in a nation, which in part, politics is meant to counter (and so is religion, but this is more of a preventative, to stop problems before they have a chance to start).

We in Britain have lost religion, and we've also opened up politics to women, creating the imbalance Im talking about.","1293840783"

I've been in a situation almost exactly like yours and ultimately I stopped making excuses when my family tried to help and I just did it.

Unfortunately when we date someone with children we run the risk of having to break up with multiple people (or SO plus the kids).

But if you're fine with a summary, I think Harris doesn't really bother to define it much, so I kinda crafted my own. ""Well-being"" comprises such things as happiness and pleasure, but also excludes the destructive kind of happiness associated with drugs or wires in the brain. I'd say it's a combination of happiness, pleasure, health and prosperity, in an environment where these conditions are likely to be maintained or even improved. Given similar levels of happiness and such, a thinner (but not undernourished) me could be said to be more well than a fatter me, because that fatter me is likely to have worse health now or later.","1293840827"

If you don't believe in god, then he will punish you, or you will be miserable and life will be devoid of meaning, 
therefore, god exists.

Since the Quran asserts scientifically valid facts, then the quran as a whole must be true, therefore, god exists.

Maybe I'm happy with an xbox because I want a chance to play some fun games with a friend who lives far away, but maybe amputer thinks that I've been tricked by corporate propaganda and shouldn't have such a device.  Who gets to decide what is acceptable?

What if my passion is creating deluxe cakes?  Maybe society doesn't ""need"" cakes and my advertising is ""corporate propaganda"" by amputer's reckoning, but maybe it's not by mine?  Who chooses?  Somebody out there is going to think that we should live in a simple agrarian society, and their view could be just as valid as mine.

If the happy medium is not defined by some other person, then there's no reason to assume that we aren't at some kind of happy medium right now.  I could go waste my money on a lot of crap, but I don't.  I'm at a happy medium right here, and if I'm going to be forced to give that up because I don't ""need"" it or because of ""corporate propaganda,"" well, we might as well live in an agrarian society.

**Always pause at the end of an opponent's turn** 

I've heard stories of players at PTQ putting dice or coins on top of their library so they don't draw before thinking about doing things at the end of their opponent's turn. 

Very often players will wait until the last minute to play instants or activated abilities, which I'm sure some others will recommend. However, when that last minute comes, they forget about it and waste their trick. Get in the habit of just pausing and thinking, ""What can I do right now?""

**Don't win harder**

I've said this in other posts before, but it bears repeating. If you have a flier and a decent blocker and they have a creature that isn't doing anything, don't waste a removal spell on it. You're winning, there's a clock and it's in your favor. There's a chance they'll drop something that can either stop the clock or give you a shorter one. If you threw away your removal then all of a sudden the game isn't going so great and instead of winning hard, you're going to lose.

**Know your win condition**

This is most relevant in limited as too often I'll see decks built without win conditions. However, even constructed can greatly benefit from heeding this advice. In a deck you need to ask yourself ""What is happening the turn before I win? Around which turn will this happen? How will you last that long?

If you say to yourself ""I'm going to win after a long game by dropping an expensive, but game-breaking card and keep stalling with blockers and counter spells until I get there,"" then you're running control.  If you say to yourself, ""I'm going to win within only a few turns by dropping creatures with high power every turn,"" then it's aggro.

As a rule of thumb, aggro wants more cards on the table (tempo advantage) and control wants to draw more cards (card advantage). I can get deep into tempo/card advantage theory, but it's done better on daily mtg, so I recommend you comb the archives for that.

If you know what your deck is, then you can build it very focused and therefore more effective and also make the right plays as far as when you should use your removal.

**Have Fun**

Too often you'll see guys tense as fuck. Magic is a game, and if you're not making money at it and not having fun, then you're wasting your time. Not only that, but people who are tense are much more likely to make mistakes, resulting in an even worse time. Loosen up, it's a game, not your career. Well not a career for most of you, anyway.","1293840864"

On a slightly more serious note, the vast majority of ""game journalism"" has a reputation for being sellouts who will give scores based upon who offers them the most ""gifts"" or pays for the most advertising space. This reputation is -well earned-, but the backlash against it is growing, and I naively hope that it's a changing scenario.

As for graphics, the last ten years of game development have been extremely heavily focused on who has the most shiny graphics to show off, this has been a push by the hardware manufacturers who have been willing to throw money at developers in order to get a game to show off their latest generation of video cards. Now that we've started to reach a plateau in where we can go with graphics (the cost of being a LOT better in graphics now is getting significantly more expensive, not saying we can't make things look better.) the focus is slowly begining to turn to other areas, hopefully the reviewers will get the memo and follow along.

"zombies","t5_2qi0e","&gt;5. Weather
&gt;You know how you have separate clothes for winter and summer? That’s because getting extremely hot or cold is bad for the human body (you may have gleaned this, over the years). Extended exposure to harsh summer sun and/or the frigid temperatures that normally accompany snow and ice will absolutely kill fully nourished and healthy humans. So how would people with open wounds, no shelter, and rapidly decaying flesh and bone respond to being out in the sun for hours or days or weeks at a time?

The efficacy of this statement has more to do with what type of zombie we're dealing with.  With a Romero zombie they perhaps have a point as some climates may accelerate the decomposition process.  However, if we're talking about a 28 Days Later disease style zombie then the weather issue goes out the door.  A living, breathing human who's frontal lobe has been deactivated by a parasite or virus can definitely survive in enough places atleast long enough to bite someone else.  In more inhospitable climates, it might be EASIER to get infected because the zombies, still retaining some sense of self preservation, will cluster where the most humans are, i.e the places warm and cozy or nice and cool.  The weather, if it is in fact that inhospitable, is more likely to trap humans in close quarters with zombies more than anything else.  All of this actually applies to Romero zombies as well, just to a lesser extent.


&gt;4. They’re already dead
&gt;they have no way to solve any other physical problem that may pop up. Oh, a zombie stepped off a curb at an awkward angle and broke his/her ankle? Have fun on the asphalt. A stray dog attacks them? Done.

You know what a human does when it breaks its ankle?  It screams and cries and calls for the assistance of dozens of other people before eventually getting well again.  You know what a zombie does? Nothing.  It keeps going, it keeps walking, crawling, swimming, it keeps doing whatever it has to do to get to you.  And please, stray dogs?  Let's assume the virus isn't capable of being transmitted to other mammals(A dangerous assumption as the Racoon City incidents have taught us) and examine what would happen if a Romero or 28DL zombie got a hold of a dog.  Again, what does a human do when attacked by a dog?  We cry and scream.  What does a zombie do?  It eats the dog.  QED.  Next.

&gt;3. Disease control
&gt;blah blah blah influenza isn't that bad.  The CDC, vaccinations, the zombie virus would be hard to contract

Seriously?  The zombie virus is hard to contract? Are you just going to sit in your house fapping for twenty years while they all die off?  You're going to HAVE to venture into the Z-zone for food,water, medicine, fuel, or ammo EVENTUALLY.  When its you against twenty zombies shambling or running right towards you, we'll see how hard the virus is to contract.

&gt;2. They’re mindless
&gt;Whether you believe they can run or not, one inescapable truth about zombies since their introduction to pop culture has been that they are conclusively no longer human. They can’t speak. They can’t avoid danger. They can’t use tools. They can’t hide and wait until your back is turned. They can’t organize and design an effective plan of attack. They can’t conserve their energy. They can’t defend themselves. Translation? Make sure there are none hiding in your house and then just shut your doors and windows. That’s literally all you ever need to do.

See above.

&gt;1. The military.
&gt;blah blah the military has too many guns to not kill the zombies, etc etc

Has any military ever fought an enemy that, upon close contact, could turn friendly troops almost immediately into enemy troops?  Are soldiers really that prepared to turn on their own comrades in arms?  What about their civilian wives, brothers, sisters, and children?  One of the reasons they use child soldiers is that it causes adults to hesitate for that crucial second, except instead of that adult getting shot, now they're a zombie.

It also does not account for the environmental impact of drilling, transporting, refining, and consuming gasoline. If you factor in the cost of 'protecting' the oil fields with the US military, the price skyrockets. Compared to oil from tar sands and shale, ethanol looks even better using those criteria to measure them.

Then you still have to talk away the $72 BILLION in subsidies for oil that dwarf all other forms of transportation energy. 

We have plants and sources for making ethanol that simply are thrown away or ignored right now. Also if we produce ethanol from what each state has available, we dont need a centralized distribution system, that will cut the cost as well. Every state has something it can grow or utilize to make ethanol, and quite a few of them are plants that grow on land that isnt fit for traditional farming methods. Mesquite pods, cattails, and cassava are just a few of them. We use corn because its widely available, its easy to use, has an ok yield. and we have an enormous surplus of it.","1293840907"

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","&gt;There's one very crucial difference between Kerry and Dubya/Obama: Kerry has actually seen war firsthand. He understands what a waste of human life and money it is. For example, take his famous speech: ""How do you ask someone to be the last man to die for a lie?"" (In reference to Vietnam.)

His inability to square this with his support of the wars in the Senate was a significant factor in his loss. Between that and the GOP smear campaign that portrayed him as a rich kid sitting on the sidelines during the war in Vietnam and exploiting his opposition for political gain he didn't really have an edge over Bush on that topic.

&gt;I don't think we would currently be anywhere near as deep in Iraq and Afghanistan if he has been elected in 2004.

Why? Kerry fully supported the war in his time in the Senate. I'd have thought some sort of change in trajectory would have been instituted by Obama by now, but that hasn't happened either.

&gt;I also believe he would find Gitmo and Abu Ghraib repugnant, after having seen atrocities in Vietnam personally. There's a far higher chance that those places would either have never existed or been closed quickly.

Again, why? I'd hope any human would find them repugnant, but the Bush administration didn't and it seems the Obama administration doesn't, either.

Could you share your opinions on how much influence you feel execs should have on album content, and what their role is in developing a successful artist? 

Second, newer hip hop artists such as Nicki Minaj and Drake have become nationally recognized acts long before they even put out an official album.  Minaj won a BET award this year without an album of her own, just on the strength of feature spots.  Is this a smart model for the music business?

However, you're right those things aren't blatantly occurring there, and there is no obvious genocide happening to the Palestinians. The Israeli government wouldn't be so strategically stupid as to replicate the Holocaust to achieve its desired end. That would be would be a little too obvious. And look, it's not like they give a damn about exterminating the Palestinians, they just simply want the land that they occupy. They're cornering them and slowly (but surely) getting rid of them so that they can take over their land without any threat of backlash from the rest world. 

What's crazy is that while they're doing these atrocious things, they're getting away with it and even being patted on the back for it. That's because the Israeli government pretty much has every other world government in its back pocket. And with the media blitz of propaganda that the Israeli government has orchestrated across the world (not to mention the anti-defamation league that will call you an anti-semite if you say anything bad about Israel), they can pretty much guarantee that they'll get away with it. 

Palestine is not under a ""somewhat oppressive occupation"" they are under a highly oppressive occupation. They are starving, they maimed and murdered, separated from their families, they have no rights and no access to medical care and little clean water. The Israelis treat them like animals, they do almost whatever they want to them and they get away with it. The Palestinian people are suffering and almost no one is backing them and *that* is wrong. Israel needs to be called out, people need to stand up and speak out against what's happening there. Most of all the Israeli's themselves need to be shown what's happening, because they don't really know.

My experience may be more limited than your Al Jazeera watching, but it does include the four countries you mention (two of which I lived in for extended periods) and a total of over 70 countries spanning 15 years during which I lived on every continent but one, working in the corporate world, non-profits, and government. I am writing you right now from a Muslim country in which I don't think I could come up with someone who ""hates"" Americans if I tried.

There are people who complain about the United States (plenty of those, myself included) but the people who actually profess to ""hate"" (your word) Americans are, I maintain, a rarity. They are people who haven't thought through their position and if you come back and talk to them after they've grown up a little bit, they've usually changed their tune.

Hating people for where they happen to come from is infantile behavior, whether it be Americans hating foreigners or the other way around. Most people just aren't that pathetic. I do find that a lot of self-hating Americans like to over-report it because it helps them to feel better about how worldly they are.

People look way too much into the value of these bullshit classes. A few years in industry and a patent pending has shown me that if any one thing is true about college, it is that you should spend as little time as possible convincing yourself it is in anyway meaningful to being succesful at work.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","He's all excited about natural gas as the solution to our energy woes, but doesn't say peep about global warming.

Other thing: He seems to think the Alberta Tar Sands are a great source of energy, and takes pot shots at wind.  I'm having a hard time finding figures from a source I really trust (it's doomers vs. cornucopians each suffering from their own confirmation bias, it seems), but the net energy, or EROEI of the tar sands is somewhere between 1.5:1 (doomers) and 8:1 (cornucopians).  Wind, after a bit of googling, seems currently to be between 10:1 and 20:1.

Finally he takes a shot at wind advocates for whining for subsidies.  Like the oil companies don't line up for their handouts.  And that's not even taking into account implicit subsidies like a trillion dollar war to secure access to Iraq's oil.

Not to mention that exploiting the tar sands on any kind of scale involves turning much of Alberta into a giant tailing pond.

I'm not a doomer, but these glaring omissions and distortions on the part of the cornucopian crowd alarm me.  If the optimists get this shit so wrong how much can they be trusted.

Just because you say ""I love you, you love me, things are okay"" doesnt exactly mean it's true. You really ought to sit down with him when you can and talk about why you're fighting. 

You need to be honest with each other and tell each person what it is about what they are doing upsets you and how it makes you feel. But, you also have to understand that this is loving criticism. From this criticism, you can then pledge to do things better (being very specific about what you're going to do). Wanting to be with someone you love means you are willing to become a better person from being with them. You don't really see your flaws until someone else tells them to you, but most of the time it's done out of spite. This needs to be done out of love. 

This talk cannot get out of hand and it's EXTREMELY difficult to stop it from getting out of hand. If it does, it could mean the end of your relationship.

I toked in her honor, and now I'm an [8] and as paranoid as can be (normally I keep it at a [3] and it's my first time living on my own.) Literally trippin out at some moments. At the very same time I'm as grateful as can be that I have something to be paranoid about. Something I have to protect. Values that I can uphold. Ideas that I can share. Pleasures that I can enjoy. Friends and family that I can love. On into infinity. This permeating feeling of value in me right now is in honor to your grandmother just as much as it is resulting from her. The way I see things, your grandmother lives on through her every child, grandchild, and so on. She has nurtured life, I'm sure, to her fullest extent. She has had her joys, and her wonders. Her actions have left a permanent imprint in you, and in everyone else she's met. Her every action will have a ripple effect into eternity. 

Perhaps this comment is no more than a rabble, but the feelings I share can't be contained in words digitally transmitted. I just want you to know that my heart goes out to you and to her. She will be missed, but lives on in a plethora of ways.

This is based on experience eating far too much McDonalds in both Ontario and New York State.  Although, I have to say the Canadian burgers are slightly better tasting and more filling due to being 100% meat instead of part cardboard filler.

I will agree though that eating the same thing multiple times every day would get boring fast. Personally I would mix it up with some Junior Chickens and the occasional Snack Wrap.  You can even get grilled chicken in the snack wrap.","1293841089"

What sucked was it was a warm rain and this caused the recent snow to melt. We lived really close to Applegate lake &amp; this was the first time they had to use the flood gates. This was known as the New Years Day flood here and we were without power for 3 days. Since we were on well water for the house, we had not running water either. We collected rain water &amp; used our camp stove to boil water &amp; cook food. I then proceeded to get cold again and the condensation started to freeze on the windows inside the house. We were never in any danger but it was quite an experience with a new born &amp; her 2 &amp;1/2 year old sister.

"reddit.com","t5_6","As an employer in the software development sector, I'll only contact your references if I'm about to offer you the job and will only ask for them after the second or third interview. And if you're a graduate, I'm not going to contact your McDonald's boss -- your probation period is far more useful than a McJob reference.

I imagine if I were a McBoss, I wouldn't contact anyone. As others have said, they're going to give you full training anyway. Hiring is often all about finding a reason NOT to hire someone. So they say 'requires experience' on jobs that clearly do not just to make it easier to cull the pile.

If you're going to make up experience, however, I would be careful not to make it directly align with your target job - after all you'll have no ""One time, when [this] happened at my last job.."" stories to tell and if you're found out, expect to be shown the door fairly quickly.

Of course, then you'll have experience and wont need to lie next time :-D

**Edit:** I should say: lying about experience is not ever a good idea. Most interviews these days are behavioural. I can't imagine McDonalds are any different. They'll ask you to tell them about a time when ""..."". And they'll spot a liar a million miles away.

You're better off making it into the exceptions pile by doing or being something different. That's what your cover letter is for. In this Reddit post you tell of a dozen things that show you're exactly what McDonalds want: dedicated and cheerful. Use the cover letter to tell that story. ""I'm a foster kid who's taken that experience to learn to be outgoing and hard working."" Then tell a one or two sentence story to indicate this.

The fact that militias are no longer around does not mean that guns should no longer be around.  That's the point.  The point is that if guns are no longer around (banned, for instance) than militias could not be formed if they needed to be.

The framers of the constitution did not intend to limit gun ownership to those in militias.  As I said, it was the

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Frankly, Forex brokers prey on new blood like you. You are the most profitable but short lived traders out there.. the young with a few grand to spare. 

Don't put a single dollar of your own capital on the line until you can paper trade profitably for at least a year. It might seem like a long time but your wallet will thank me later.

Even after that year has passed (and you've been consistently profitable throughout the entire time) only start with money you could afford to never see again. 

Take it from someone who spent nearly two years making up for the losses I had in my first year... lately I've been able to do some nice things with trading profits (like fly to a tropical island last winter on vacation entirely paid for by trading profits), but it has come after nearly 4 years of experience (and that by no means I'll get rich from trading either, I have many more years of learning to go before I even consider myself ""good"".)

Start here: 

http://www.babypips.com/school/

This is by far the best resource to learn from as a new forex trader. Once you've completed all levels of schooling in this online course, start your journey paper trading and keeping a trading journal as you go. 

GOOD LUCK!



(PS. if you feel this is too long to wait and paper trade and you really want in on the action anyway... instead of losing the few grand you want to put in, go out and buy something nifty like a new computer or new bedroom set... either way the money will be gone but at least you'll have something to show for it.)

With no context given for what ""+"" actually means, you can't say that 1+1=2 is always true.  If you have a universe with exactly 1 item in it, the concept of 2 doesn't even really make sense.

My point is this: ""1+1=2"" is entirely useless in showing any particular truth about existence.  It's how we describe our observations of the universe.  In that sense, it's subjective.  In the sense that it's independently verifiable by other humans, it's objective.  But those are different senses.","1293841220"

AUTOBIOGRAPHY

I, Yusov Nikolai Ivanovitch, born 32 December 1843 in the state of Arkansas, USA, finished West Point War Academy (department of diversionary practice).

In 1969 I landed in the Moscow forest massif, to infiltrate the Preparation Center of Kosmonauts and sabotage all manned Russian flights.

I've been doing that successfully until now, and I've full trust of the KGB and CIA.

My father, Brezinsky Ivan, during the revolution personally killed with a sabre 76 kommisars from Baku, and my sister and brother, working in Riga, successfully sabotage Russian nuclear submarines, steal nuclear warheads and sell them to Honduras.

I'm also related to the pilot Hammersom (USA), who dropped the third nuclear bomb on Tokyo (the bomb didn't detonate), and my uncle Hammers, being mentally ill, jumped out from the bomber B-29 without a parachute after the bomb.  Nobody knows about that.

I've defended a dissertation on the topic of ""Secret insertion of superdoses of alcohol into the blood system of kosmonaut candidates"" and effectively implement it on test subjects.

I carry full personal responsibility for the veracity of all the facts of my autobiography.  Lt. colonel N. I. Yusov, candidate of technical sciences.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;have 3 kids, one of which is only 1.5 years old right now. I insure she has all of the skills you qualify as making a human a 'people'.

Maybe, probably not (and I have no evidence to suggest otherwise so there's not a need for me to say anything else). What are your 1.5 year old's life goals? Biggest fears? Can you guys have a discussion about the social contract? If you presented the kid with a situation involving social norms to which the kid hasn't experienced, would it be able to come up with rules on the fly the same way a crow or ape might be able to use tools?

I also have to question whether or not you're biased... it's a lot harder for a parent to accept the idea that the three humans they love so much aren't technically people (and because of that, may not have the same protective rights as people which might make the parent feel uneasy realizing that the perhaps stealing/killing a baby is about as significant as stealing/killing your neighbor's dog).

&gt;She is very empathetic and loving, and she has a very different personality then the other two girls who are now both older.

I could say the same thing about my cats. They're not people.

&gt;P.S. I am a psych major, and have studied this topic in depth.

Then you know that personhood is an arbitrary line... if you choose to draw it at an earlier stage, do so, but I don't particularly find that line very significant.... the same is true for dolphins.

Here's a thought though... it's been hypothesized that childhood amnesia (which typically happens up until the age of 4) is caused by the human's language still being developed and because they can't put their thoughts and memories into effective words, they forget things (this might also be very similar to having intense psychedelic experiences which become so abstract it's hard for people to recall exactly what was going on).

If this is true (and actually it doesn't matter if the two are connected which I'll explain in a bit), then not only is the young human's language skills significantly underdeveloped when contrasted with a ""real"" person, but the young human won't even be able to REMEMBER their choices meaning they couldn't even really be held accountable.

I guess you could say that we sort of established a continuum for that issue. I'd argue that an 8 year old is a person, but I would make concessions for him if he made a mistake because he's still young (just like we make distinctions between adults and minors). I think the difference though is that I can still remember a great deal of my choices at 8 and to some extent, I can still own up to them just like I can agree that being a minor means I'm probably less mature than I will be when I'm an adult, but I can still understand and remember the transition and I can still feel guilt and pride over my past actions. The same just isn't true of myself when I was 2 (and from 3-4, it gets a little hazy)... I don't feel guilty for being annoying at night with my crying nor do I feel particularly ashamed that for a few years, I was too incompetent to use the toilet.

The first 2 years of a human's life is like a drunk who's hit the blackout stage of the night where they continue performing tasks, talking and moving around, but none of it is committed to long-term memory and they have few inhibitions. This goes back to drawing lines... I draw a line where the development of the person is part of that person's personal memory.

Looking at a photo of yourself when you were 2 and saying, ""That was me, the person at the age of 2"" is like having your mind swapped into another body and then feeling nostalgic about that body's childhood; as faras  you're concerned, the old body could have been a life-saving doctor or nazi... neither scenario makes much of a difference to you now. The same is true for person's and their early childhood. Sure, your early childhood affected your development, but the same is true for you as a fetus and embryo, but neither are really people either.","1293841323"

The first I notice is the part where you imply that it might not be morally wrong to abuse them if they weren't intelligent. I highly doubt you desired that meaning, but that's how it came out. 

Secondly, the phrase would be that humans don't give A fuck, implying we don't care. To say we don't give fuck would imply we would be unwilling to gift them physical objects of some sort. 

And thirdly, your comment as a whole doesn't seem to really be meaningful in reply to its parent comment, unless you are saying it would be morally wrong to abuse dolphins by treating them like humans. (since we treat humans so badly, as the parent comment was talking about) Regardless of your intended meaning, the meaning didn't get through clearly. Next time try using less pronouns.

At the beginning of the season, I would buy a new pair to be my 'game' gloves. When the game gloves degraded enough, they would become my 'practice' gloves and I would purchase a new pair. Replacement time was more about when I was financially able to replace. Having an extra practice pair around came in handy a couple times when the nice pair got ripped during a game.

I will admit that I was a bit spoiled when I was a kid with nice gloves - which I fully blame for me having pretty bad hands until I was about 16. When you have good form, 'expensive' gloves become a better investment because the degrade less quickly. Being a student keeper with expensive gloves was stupid. A good hint at at when you should buy nice gloves is when your left and right gloves begin to degrade at the same rate - no matter if you are right or left dominant. At least, that is what I tell my students.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","No.. Hot air rises and all. But you don't want air to just 'float' around. 

You want to have a solid flow of air, pull from the front. pull through your CPU heatsink (please don't tell me you have one that blows towards the motherboard), and then pulled out the back of the PC.

The exhaust fan up top shouldn't be used unless you just don't care about air flow and are happy with a 'meh' setup.

For an ideal setup, I'd have 2 fans at the front. Both pulling in. and 1 fan on the back. That way you'd have one fan blowing in, hopefully at the same level as your CPU, then behind that, a fan blowing out.

The 2nd front fan would be cooling your HDD's a little, and then continuing through to the PSU and GPU.

Ideally you want as much air going out as there is going in. You also want a steady solid flow so dust doesn't settle if it gets past your filters.","1293841363"

I'm not suggesting for a second that we shouldn't question these practices, but that doesn't mean we should be openly reviled by them either. I am personally reviled by honour killings and stoning for adultery, but we can't impose our morality on other cultures and just expect them to agree. It's been tried many times in the past, with at best mixed success.

Yes these things are morally repellent. To us. Now. But they're still a lot more civilised than we were even a couple of hundred years ago. In britain people were hanged for theft, arranged marriages were commonplace, there were workhouses and debtors prison. In america there was full-scale genocide. If you look at mormon communities (Rare, but contemprary) there's still forced marriage going on in america.

Obviously, I don't fucking know. But, quantum mechanics have been researched by Governments since the turn of the 20th century. Rumors of a Unified Field Theory surfaced in the 20s and 30s, Germany was working on the A-Bomb and levitation during WWII, we got the bomb first and stole their scientists and technology. Russia got a good bit, too. 

Given the technology required to travel across the universe, if it existed within our physical universe, we'd likely see visitors frequently. People have a solid concept of Aliens from another planet. From another reality? That's a mind fuck. The body of evidence suggests that only the US Government has insight into the UFO phenomena, as almost all other governments have shrugged and publicly given up on finding out what they are; but none seem too worried. That's odd.

Keeping secrets is easy in the Government, contrary to popular belief. Fund research through Congress, kill the project 11 months later, cite lack of funds, take all research, pack up the lab, dismiss the team, continue with a new team with no knowledge or contact with previous team. Rinse, repeat. No team knows exactly what they worked on, they get pissed when the contract gets pulled, and the research belongs to the Government. Tell them its for application X, but that's a lie.

Use a mix of military, civie, and private industry scientists with various NDAs, half-truths, and false implications of the project, and no one has any fucking idea who is doing what for what reason and everyone is scared shitless to talk about it due to guns and an NDA, and the fact that they'll look like a crazy person talking about how our Government may have the capability to go to ""other realities"".

Realistically, if this technology exists, it is kept under lock and key because it can nullify nuclear arsenals and likely be far more deadly than nukes. ","1293841417"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Commenting on both the situation, and other commeters posts, you cannot feel like marriage is the only way you can get her to stay. If she loves you and wants to be with you, she'll stay. If she doesn't, she'll go. Now, she could fall in love with you from now until she has to decide to stay or go, but honestly with her thinking about going to India, that's going to dominate her mind, so she won't be able to decide on you. It'll just be a stalemate, honestly.

I am never for being in relationships for the sake of being in a relationships, and that's what it seems like you're doing. If you both agree that there aren't long-term plans, then you need to end the relationship. You're wasting your time. You never know, you could meet the perfect girl of your dreams tomorrow and you would have turned her down because you were in a rocky relationship.

The fact that right now, she can't choose between staying and India means that at this moment in time, you're not important enough to her to stay right where she is and explore her professional options near you. I'm sorry to say it like that, but it's true.

Sure, you can be FWB if the sex is good, but you may not be down for that, or she may not be. You can feel free to explore that possibility, because you're probably not going to be talking to her after the break-up anyway.","1293841418"

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Maybe the first ones aren't available at a library or where someone might get books.  D Sweet has painted some nice covers, and maybe the picture on one might be more appealing prima faciae to someone just picking up a random book.  it is not an approach many would recommend, but it works for some sometimes.

I suppose it depends on the series, some seem to be a sequence of almost independant stories, they might share some elements, characters, settings perhaps, but the can be read stand alone, examples Fritz Leiber, Conan stuff, King, Lovecraft, CS Lewis, some Leguin Maybe, a lot of Star Trek, or Star Wars, or D&amp;D, or WoW or TSR books etc.  You said ""epic"" though, so maybe these might not quite count.  Interestingly you might consider the Star Wars films (not having read the novelizations), as an epic, but they are relatively watchable independently.

By contrast, some series seem to be one strong narrative split over several books stuff like Brooks, Eddings, Williams, Feist and many more.  Most people can't just start with the Two Towers or The Return of the King and understand or enjoy the story.  Tolkien stated he wrote it as one long book, and it was split for publishing.

Having Read ASoIaF by Martin, and WoT by Jordan, their series seems a little more independant than LOTR, while still epic and not stand alone.  If those series are emblematic of modern fantasy epics, it might indicate a small trend.  Perhaps modern publishers and editors would urge authors (if they weren't so inclined) to soften the edges of their books, so someone can pick up #3 of some series and not be entirely confused.  Adding little recaps, or glossaries, that kind of thing.  Kind of like the ""so far on X..."" that you might see in television programs.  ","1293841428"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I got busted with acid among a few other drugs. Distribution of most of the other drugs was considered a third degree crime in my state, which is not too bad. However, distribution of LSD was considered a first degree crime, which is incredibly serious.

I was put in jail and my bail was set at $150,000 with no 10% option due to the first degree crime. 

My lawyer basically told me I would have to rat dealers out otherwise face 10 years in a maximum security prison. So I did that, and it sucked. I ended up ratting out about 5 dealers. All my friends know what I did and I'm constantly in fear of one of these guys coming after me.

I ended up getting 5 years probation and I'm now stuck with a criminal record. A shitty situation to face at age 18. So all I'm saying is, although you may think you aren't hurting anyone, you are putting yourself at incredible risk. Getting caught with 100 hits of acid is enough to get yourself a first degree felony. All it takes is one person to get busted, mention your name to the cops or set you up. And it sounds like you probably wouldn't be able to successfully rat out your dealer.

So please be careful.. because its really not worth it. If you want to trip acid from time to time, just buy it for yourself.","1293841443"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Interesting.

The 3500 ""calories = 1 pound of fat"" applies less cleanly to weight gain, as the AHA and ACSM statement refers to.  When a person has too many calories, they don't all turn to stored body fat.  Some of the excess calories are flushed from the body.  Clearly, some people overeat and gain, others over eat and don't.

But in the case of *weight loss*, the energy needs to come from some where.  Either it comes from food, fat/muscle stores, or metabolism adjusts.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","The trouble with using a pressure washer is that it can force dirt and other undesirable crud deep into the various bearings on your bike and cause them to wear out and not roll smoothly.

What I do is I either prop the bike up with a cinderblock or set it upside down in my driveway and use a bucket of warm water with a little bit of simple green and a garden hose without any nozzle.  I put my thumb over the opening of the hose if I want a little bit of pressure to push off chunks of dirt or to clean out the treads of the tires, keeping the stream away from bearings.  I use a rag with the warm soapy water to clean the frame, rims, cranks, anything that isn't a chain or a cog.  When the bike is clean, I lightly rinse it off with the hose and bounce it on its tires a couple times to shake off most of the water then let it stand someplace warm to dry.  Once its dry I apply a coat of Pedro's Bike Lust to the frame, forks, and cranks.  Its a sort of polish that gives the bike a nice shine and helps keep dust and grime from sticking to it, makes it easier to clean in the future.  

I clean rim brake tracks and brake pads with rubbing alcohol.  One treatment of that on a dirty neglected bike will make it feel like it has brand new brakes!

The chain and cogs are the toughest part.  I use a rag and plenty of citrus degreaser to cut through the grime.  If you really want to get all the grime out of the chain, you can take it off and soak it in some water with degreaser for a few hours, but thats usually not necessary.  I clean the chainrings with a rag and degreaser, running the rag between the rings and over each tooth.  I clean the cassette with a ""toothbrush"" or ""grungebrush"", a narrow brush with long bristles for fitting between the cogs.  An actual toothbrush also works pretty well for the chain.  Sometimes, if the cassette is really dirty, I take it off the hub and take all the cogs out and wipe them down individually so they are shiny.  Once all the running gear is mostly grime free and there is no dirt or sand on it, I apply chainlube.  Occasionally, I take the rear derailleur plates off and clean and lube the pulleys. That tends to improve shifting performance.  

This is all a pretty involved process and can take up a whole afternoon depending on how thorough you want to be.  It helps to just wipe the bike down quickly with a rag after every few rides, you won't have to do a complete clean as often.  Anytime you're working with the chain and gears, expect to get your hands dirty. ","1293841476"

Standard STD screens (at least in the US) almost never include a herpes test.  Most people who say they get checked for STDs actually have not been tested for herpes.  Have you ever specifically asked for a herpes test?  Call your practitioner and ask if they can do an IgG test (HerpeSelect is a common brand) for HSV-1 and 2.

You are safer having sex with someone with HSV who knows she has it and discloses it to you (and who is on antiviral meds) than you are with someone who just says ""I've had STD tests"" or ""I've never suspected I had an STD"".

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","I read the wiki article and your comments below about your experience with these sorts of laws. 
To me, at least the Wikipedia article's interpretation of the law doesn't imply that risks assumed include having one's sexual wants overridden when communicated.  It seems the only risks assumed are the ones directly related to the specific activities consented to.

However, it is definitely more difficult to prove nonconsent to a specific sex act after consenting to sex holistically.  So a person should probably understand that they assume these risks, since it is unlikely they will be able to retaliate legally. This is not ideal, and this does not make that this happens okay, I sort of wish I didn't feel I had to clarify this to not come off as a monster.  

Either way, how sure are you that this difference between consent and permission exists, or that having proved that a subset of sexual activities were not consented to that one couldn't press rape charges?

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c"," ranked lower than .... in ‘sharing their vision of American society.’ &lt;-- not exactly what i would consider hate, how could a creationist and an atheist be the most likely to share a vision for society.  Would Christians be on the top of the list for your vision of society sharing?  I don't think this is hate, or really relevant other that saying it's incompatible.

I did not know about atheists in office or juries, thanks for that info, it was enlightening. 

The pope is a religious leader and chief of one of the most corrupt and long standing churches of time.  If you were supposed to be ""God's right hand man"" you'd blame everything on atheists too I think, it's kind of his Job.  I'm not saying it's right, or that I follow catholicism... I'm just saying the pope is kind of a bad reference for it to make a point to me for the sake of this argument, at least not from a rational Christian's perspective... he's a direct bias, and the freaking pope lol.

As far as the guy with the kids, it's tragic, i watched the video.  Gnostic, to my knowledge, isn't atheist.  Also, I doubt that was the reasoning for his loss of custody at all, didn't see a shred of evidence for it, only that it was cited as part of the trial in his paperwork.  Most likely it was because the mother is ALWAYS favored and men in general have no rights these day, especially not the white ones.

And saying none of those things happen to Christians is wrong, maybe not as often, and in America... but it's simply unfounded.

Not to say I don't see the side of your argument, but to re-iterate what i said previously... I meant Christians attacking atheists in a similar way... as in constantly belittling them in such childish form on internet forums, for no reason... key words ""a similar way.""

And no, I have not been in a coma, I simply have a different perspective... Please be respectful of that.","1293841484"

I second, everyone else in recommending some lab work done. I also recommend you dig through http://www.veganhealth.org/. It's a top notch site with well cited recommendations by a fellow RD.

Finally, some quick iron tips:

1) eat beans, fortified foods, dark green leafy veggies and combine the with a source of vitamin c to enhance absorption.

2) Ease off of coffee/green tea (or take with an iron fortified ""milk"" product) to negate their deleterious effects.

3) My favorite: cook in a cast iron skillet!

I agree it would be pretty dumb to not find out what they have. But when you're dealing with something that's hot a lot of times it comes down to trying to get it out of your hands quickly and getting what you can regardless of the actual worth. And honestly if I came across it (just based on the picture), I don't know that I'd be able to gauge the value of it. I certainly wouldn't have any idea that it could be worth $30k without doing some research. I mean, I'd assume a few thousand at least but you can't get that selling stolen merchandise unless you have buyers with very specific tastes who would also have to know what the thing was worth.

&gt;I sincerely hope they get sold out by whoever they try to sell it to. It would be a damn shame for such a beautiful piece of engineering to be destroyed as a result of incompetence and greed.

That's probably a serious understatement. Reunification would mean that SK would have to take on 20 million or so welfare cases. I mean, I'm not an expert on SK labour regulations, but I'm assuming a half-starving subsistence farmer who probably hasn't even seen a modern tractor is going to have serious problems getting even a minimum wage job. The only way to build the NK economy *fast* is to allow for shit that happens in China. That means having different legislations for both regions. It's a fucking nightmare.

And then you have the problem with ownership. As far as I know, NK hasn't seen even small market reforms that might clear up ownership claims during and after unification. So you might end up with a repeat of the Russian switch to a market economy where party apparatchiks swindled the land and property from people for next to nothing. And the Soviets implemented *some* market reforms before the transition, so people weren't absolutely oblivious to how things worked in the new system.

I don't know. The only way I see reunification working is through a *sloooow* process where ownership is figured out and SK pumps welfare money into NK to keep people from starving.","1293841549"

The second one, the religious tests required for an office holder were dropped when the Constitution was ratified; the article you cited there says that quite clearly.  Religious testing for any state official hasn't been required for almost two hundred years.  I may be a bit off on that one, but the article seemed to be pretty clear that religious testing is *banned.*

The third one, no argument, that guy's a douchebag.

The fourth one, that's Fox News you're citing there.  If you actually look at what's happening, it's not an ""agnostic guy is getting screwed"" story so much as it's a ""divorced man is getting screwed"" story that's getting a very Fox News spin to make it seem more controversial than it really is.

Somebody checked this mother to be into that hospital and promised her that her rights to respect and privacy would be honored and guarded.  This mother then had a happy baby (or maybe not, maybe she lost the baby from malformations and this made it an interesting teaching tool), and then was asked if her placenta could be used as a teaching tool for young and learning nurses.  Then, the next day, this new mother sees what could be her placenta on the internet?  If i was this mother, or any mother that delivered in the correct time period at that hospital, i would demand that these nurses in training be sacked.

I really don’t know anything about this, but maybe it’s the pressure to be successful? It seems to me as if it increased during the last century or something, especially in the last maybe ten years. There is some social pressure to have a steep career curve, but there is even more pressure because it became easier and easier during the last one or two decades to lose your job (or don’t get one at first) and end up at the bottom of society.

This pressure increases even more if you go to college, because the stakes are higher: if you fail, your investments in money and time are gone and you have to start from the bottom. Maybe empathy cannot be increased but only decreased by making it too much of a risk to show empathy.","1293841607"

I'm a Radiologist; we see quite a number of people like you who aren't discovered until they reach us so I had to raise the issue.


Now that whiplash injury you mentioned can indeed give you neck and shoulder pain, most likely from some degree of nerve root compression. However, the ear symptoms that you described along with their progression sound *a lot* like Otitis Interna (aka labyrinthitis) more than anything else. Symptoms include severe vertigo (the kind that has you rushing to ER), tinnitus and nausea with OR without hearing loss and ear pain. It *may* be preceeded by a bout of Otitis Media, which may explain the sensation of ear-fullness you had prior. Ménière's is something to consider, however the symptoms usually worsen over time rather than improve, plus some degree of hearing loss is usually present.


That being said, it is quite possible that you have two entirely unrelated conditions, which is probably why the ER doctor dismissed the connection. You would indeed require an MRI for both; one of your neck for assessment of your intervertebral disk, spinal cord and nerve roots, and another of your ears for assessment of your inner ear and 8th cranial nerve--both can be done in the same setting.


In any case, don't get too worked up over it. You should continue your follow-up with you ENT doctor and see where it stands.


Again, best wishes, happy new year and keep us posted :)


EDIT: Just saw that last part. Have you been having the pain and tenderness since the whiplash or is it something new? You might want to start with a series of plain c.spine x-rays to rule out fractures. Note that some undisplaced fractures can be next to impossible to see on plain x-ray, so you might end up needing a CT scan (MRI isn't the best for visualization of fractures, especially in the c.spine. but if a CT shows a fracture, then MRI is done next to assess nerve injury).","1293841617"

If you're a newbie (or of newbie-esque skill), I suspect most of the coaching would be geared toward getting a general sense of macro and strategy, while slowly adding in more and more wrinkles and refinements.

In my head, it seems remarkably similar to what a tennis coach would do: Some days will be technique work (the strokes are the foundation of tennis - if you don't have them, you've got nothing), other days will be drills to learn new skills/shots, and some days will be more like actual matches, with constant feedback and support.","1293841621"

There were Italians in NYC who just 'disappeared', they were arrested and never came back and their families didn't know where they were for several months until they were arrested and taken to join them in a barb wire prison(internment) camp later.

And these were not immigrates, these were FULL BORN US CITIZENS who were totally denied all of their constitutional and human rights for years at a time.

The US is fully capable of total full-on fascism when it wants to.

"economy","t5_2qhpn","As someone who has worked at a debt purchasing company, this doesn't even surprise me. There were days when we would literally sign affidavits for hours at a time without looking at them--they were all the same litigious grist. We also had employees who were notaries so that they could notarize them all. Instead of writing our names underneath, we'd have a stamp with the name on it, and sometimes the person stamping would be someone else altogether [assembly line-like]. If the wrong name got stamped or something like that, the only reason to print another affidavit would be to cover your ass in court, except by the time it was noticed tens or hundreds would already be stamped [since speed was the idea]. And each affidavit could be ten or twenty printed pages, printed by someone else from some database which is a pain in the ass to back-track &amp; pin down.

So, yeah, from the *company's* point of view, it is just ""sloppiness."" What doesn't make sense [to a law-abiding citizen] is why the courts *agree*.

Maybe though, you know, it's okay, 'cause, like, they lower interest rates by buying off bank debt for pennies on the dollar and then trying to collect it back from you with all kinds of inflated fees so their CEO can go on cocaine binges in his Miami Vice-shirt pimpin' lifestyle.","1293841639"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","""Utilitarianism is a union of Hedonism and Christianity. The first teaches man to love pleasure; the second, to love his neighbor. The union consists in teaching man to love his neighbor’s pleasure. To be exact, the Utilitarians teach that an action is moral if its result is to maximize pleasure among men in general. This theory holds that man’s duty is to serve—according to a purely quantitative standard of value. He is to serve not the well-being of the nation or of the economic class, but “the greatest happiness of the greatest number,” regardless of who comprise it in any given issue.""

-[Ayn Rand](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/utilitarianism.html)

[Objectivism](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/happiness.html) on the other hand, ""holds that the good must be defined by a rational standard of value, that pleasure is not a first cause, but only a consequence, that only the pleasure which proceeds from a rational value judgment can be regarded as moral, that pleasure, as such, is not a guide to action nor a standard of morality. To say that pleasure should be the standard of morality simply means that whichever values you happen to have chosen, consciously or subconsciously, rationally or irrationally, are right and moral. This means that you are to be guided by chance feelings, emotions and whims, not by your mind. My philosophy is the opposite of hedonism. I hold that one cannot achieve happiness by random, arbitrary or subjective means. One can achieve happiness only on the basis of rational values. By rational values, I do not mean anything that a man may arbitrarily or blindly declare to be rational. It is the province of morality, of the science of ethics, to define for men what is a rational standard and what are the rational values to pursue.""

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","In the 50s, men had a fairly good chance at getting a job in one company and remaining in that company until retirement date. They weren't involved in the childcare. My grandfather was prescribed Valium, which he took every day after work until he read an article about how it was habit forming. A man staying home from work would have been laughed at, just as paternity leave was unthinkable. Men had a lot of pressure on them to perform perfectly, as it wasn't easy for them to change their professions once they got into it. Men remained relatively stationary, as they tended to remain with one company for most of their lives.

Women who had money could afford to pay housekeepers to look after their children. My father's family had a woman who did a lot of cooking and cleaning. Poor women had to work, but they weren't paid much for their skills. Children were kept in playpins, and affection and touching were thought to damage children, so there was very little positive interaction for a great deal of people. Women who wanted to or needed to work out of home were severely limited in the types of jobs they could get. Bored housewives were also highly dosed with valium and other drugs designed to 'fix' them. To make work easier for themselves, house-wives typically had a limited menu. Monday was meatloaf night, Tuesday chicken pot pie, etc. As the women in a neighborhood remained together for a long period of time, they would often form close friendships and spend time at each others houses, doing chores together, and sharing child rearing duties.

Water droplets release heat in the moment that they turn from liquid form to solid. This heat is what keeps the plant relatively warm. The two very important requirements for doing this are that 1) the water must stay on - the moment water flow stops, the plant drops to air temperature. Groves with electric water pumps have problems when the power goes out during a storm. 2) You need a high flow of water. Home sprinklers simply don't put out enough water to keep the plants from freezing. As you see here, they will just make ice. At my school, they once used overhead sprinklers on some of their orange trees during winter, but the water spray wasn't concentrated enough and only the plants they sprayed died.","1293841681"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Joseph Smith most definitely was a real person, yet that doesn't pose a threat to a critique of Mormonism.  Whether he really existed is irrelevant; what's important is the validity of his claims (whether made by him personally or his associates).  The evidence weighs heavily on the side of his being incorrect and/or untruthful, and this doesn't change because he was a physical human being.

I caution my fellow non-believers against anything more than an intellectual curiosity regarding Jesus' historicity for a very pragmatic reason:  the evidence (which we so often claim to admire) sides with such a man existing around the time he was supposed to, and even if it didn't the falsity of the religion would not change.  On the other side, an insistence that Jesus didn't even exist goes contrary to generally accepted, thoroughly researched history and does nothing whatever for advancing the idea that ""his"" (for lack of a better term) religion is untrue...  

Taking such a line lends credence to the idea that atheist are dogmatic and hypocritical.  Jesus most likely existed.  He was also most likely a man, a carpenter, a Jew, and maybe a rabbinical teacher.  None of that threatens our conclusions in any way, so let us not be so hasty to give the Christians free ammunition against us, ok?

TL;DR  --  Jesus' existence is fairly uncontroversial among historians.  All that we non-believers saying he didn't exist does is give Christians a reason to call us hypocritical (for not looking critically at the evidence).","1293841685"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Let me see if I catch your drift.

Person X is a Muslim, and believes in a very literal interpretation of the Qu'ran. Person X therefore believes that he has to kill all the nonbelievers, and thus flies a plane into a building.

Person Y is a Muslim, but does not believe in a literal interpretation. Person Y therefore is a reasonable human being.

Is that what you're saying?

I see your point, but I think I disagree on the causal nature of belief. I gather, and correct me if I'm wrong, that your opinion is that the causal chain goes something like this:

'Radical' Muslim =&gt; Kill people; where 'radical' means they believe in a literal interpretation of all the bad bits of the Qu'ran.

I, however, disagree with this notion. I think the causal chain likely looks more like this:

Muslim =&gt; Wants to kill people =&gt; Subscribes to a literal interpretation of the Qu'ran =&gt; Kills people. In this case, ""Muslim"" could be replaced with any in-group term.

I don't think Islam is a cause, just an excuse. My feeling is that there are some very pissed off folk in a region that happens to be Islamic. I'd bet that if the Middle East were predominately Jewish, they'd be cherry-picking some nasties from the Old Testament.

I think our fundamental disagreement is whether or not Islam itself is the reason these guys get mad enough to fly planes into buildings (etc). I don't think it is, and again, there are 1.5 billion people who would agree.","1293841730"

The later books abandon this device for a more straightforward style.  The story deals with self-aware AI's, far-forward evolution, plausible consequences of FTL travel, and lots and LOTS of literary references commenting on the ultimate aims of humanity, religion, and art.

Furthermore, it seems your whole tirade is a matter of mistakenly taking what you read on the internet (""hate Americans for being American"") literally.  That, again, screams of a lack of experience, so I'll make this as simple as possible:

Statements made off the cuff are generally understood to potentially be a victim of hyperbole.  For example, this is not the best trail mix *ever* sitting before me, but were I to state that it were, it would be generally understood to mean it's darn good.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","If I were in a committed monogamous relationship with someone, how would I be able to determine if another person would be more compatible with me than them? I argued that I can't find out how compatible we are until I date them for a substantial time. 

The percentages that I mentioned refer to compatibility, not to 'social superiority' - that entire concept (that one person would be 'better'  than another person) is completely alien to me. People may be more compatible with me, but that doesn't make them better.

I'm not sure about your experiences, but in none of my relationships has the idea of 'someone better than you' played a role in a break up. Maybe your experiences are different, but the idea of 'lining up a 'better' partner before leaving the old one' sounds unethical to me, and it's not something that I ever encountered. The reason for break-up (in all my relationships) was coming to the conclusion that I (or my partner) felt that there were serious problems that we couldn't solve because we weren't compatible enough.

Better yet, even in none of my nonmonogamous relationships has the idea of dating a more 'socially desirable'  or 'better' partner ever played a role. dating multiple people because they're different and complement you in different ways? Yes. But no quest for 'how high can I reach'. 

After all, being committed holds the assumption that you've decided that this person is more than worthy to be in a relationship with. Whether or not you get to have more relationships at the same time, doesn't play a part in that practice. ","1293841790"

If you don't follow those, then your morality comes from elsewhere. I believe it comes from our upbringing.  it comes from learning. It comes from negative experiences in childhood. feelings are intense at a young age.  we learn that our actions hurt others. being mean only gets us in trouble, or in fights, both of which are negative reinforcements for misbehavior. we learn there are forces at play for which our actions must be accounted for. These forces are NOT god, they are simply things such as consequences with our parents, the law, school, etc.  Morality, in my opinion, is mostly image preservation. we are inclined to be moral beings so as to increase positive social interactions and decrease the chance for public disapproval. God's presence has absolutely no need, and in my opinion, no presence within the confounds of morality. it is simply a product of a very long process of human progression. ","1293841796"

Wow, the ignorance and selfishness of this statement is astonishing, clearly written by someone who has absolutely no firsthand knowledge of what goes into a great show.

If you see an amazing concert, and you love the show, then like it or not there's an army of people behind it.  And these people work very, very hard, and are often way smarter and have more talent then the acts they're supporting.  There's a reason that a handful of mixers, producers, engineers, etc. keep working and making incredible albums.  Quincy Jones, Rick Rubin, Brian Eno, George Martin, etc., and an army of tech guys who you don't know.  Like it or not, these people are critical in creating the sound that you're enjoying, and often are far, far more successful then the bands they're backing.  And you're just taking them for granted.

Want an example?  I picked a minor 80's group at random and googled Pet Shop Boys.  As far as I know they haven't done a damn think in twenty years.

Then I clicked on their producer, some guy named [Stephen Hague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hague).  Guess what, in the last ten years he's worked for Peter Gabriel, Robbie Williams, Melanie C and Tom Jones.  I guarantee he made at least six figures from each project, too.

So next time you want to attack these guys for lack of creativity, think about how successful you're shitty, unknown band will be in twenty years, and how successful your techs will be.

PS- Sorry, I was so pissed by that point that I forgot to address the rest.

&gt;I don't think I ever said anything about messing up anyone elses property.

Really?  Because before you said:

Gay people aren't automatically aroused by the same sex any more than straight people are by the opposite sex--not all women are fuckable, right? They're not ugly, they're just not the viewer's type. 

A woman has to want me (or, like burlesque or stripping, has to perform like she likes me) to arouse me. Sure, it's nice to check out a girl, but it's not a skeevy thing. I've showered during college PE courses in full view of other women, them in full view of me, and all of us chatting about boyfriends and girlfriends like it's nothing. I didn't leer and it wasn't a big deal. So they're hot? They're showering. They're doing a necessary grooming procedure in the nude.

As far as the attacks on Reddit... You find us silly, I look at your actions and find them childish, offensive, and a means to do nothing but propel more hate into the chasm.  Every-time I see one, my visions of the atheist majority (at least on Reddit) lose credit for that whole ""morality"" thing you just spoke of.  It's just childish trolling... At least in my eyes, but hey it's a stereotype... I understand most isnt serious... it's just constant, a bit pathetic that you have to focus so much on it.  A person is a person regardless of their belief.

Look at how defensive nascar fans are when you pick on their sport... and hell you can be called a terrorist for disagreeing with your country's politics...

I guess the best we can do is continue to try to look at people on a case by case basis... I'm me, you're you... atheist and Christian titles really work to generate a lot of hate on both sides, with little understanding to bridge the gap.

Something like 40% will have oral HSV-1 (which can become someone else's oral or genital HSV-1) by age 40.  A few get HSV-2 orally as well.

Herpes is everywhere.  I wholly encourage you to continue trying to avoid it (if you haven't already been tested clean...most people haven't been tested for it at all), but it's really not grounds for offing yourself.

So, if you must partake in ""harder, addictive"" drugs, I recommend you do so with caution and purpose behind your experience.  Know your exit, know when you're not doing it again, and know it's a one time thing.  Set up your environment properly, and in this case, you're free to explore knowing the risks you're already taking.

Germans invaded our town on November 21, 1941. They had taken Kursk 6 days prior. Busses were supposed to have arrived in the intervening days to evacuate us east, but they never came. I woke up early the morning of the invasion and walked slowly outside. As far around as I could see smoke rose from the hills. Most of the city had burned the night before in preparation for the german invasion -- better the city be razed than for it serve the enemy. Across the street I noticed a man, aged 60 years or so, gathering water from a pipe. Before he could finish, a group of 6 or 7 germans appeared. Upon seeing them, he tried to escape back into his house, but they shot him dead. I still remember how his blood so vividly colored the snow around where he fell. They then turned to unleash a hail of bullets at me as I quickly fled inside. Thankfully, none found their mark, and they had better things to do that day than murder children and so did not pursue. A year and a half the nazis held the city until the Russian army captured it once more.","1293841965"

The sun, forest fires, those natural factors? Those have existed for millions of years. Our climate is a result of the relative equilibrium those have been at. There's a certain average amount of heat hitting the earth per-year from the Sun, that doesn't change very much. There's a certain amount of carbon released on average per-year by forest fires, animal exhalation, etc. There's a certain amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plant matter every year as well. Some heat is reflected out into the atmosphere, some is kept in. That's all relatively constant over the long run. That's not the problem- that's what has kept the earth at a temperature suitable for human life for so long.

Our recent actions of cutting down a large amounts of forest, digging up sequestered carbon in the form of coal, pumping it up in the form of petroleum, burning those, releasing great amounts of *additional* carbon into the atmosphere while reducing the ecosystem's ability to absorb it back - that is a problem.

I am aware that the case of a black man being treated unjustly is not new, which is why it is not what I was talking about.

A cop that does what is right and tells the truth about what happens should be the norm, but we now call for promotions because we have allowed it to become so common place to accept bad behavior.

The same goes for things like dead beat parents. I am so disappointed when I hear someone say ""at least he stuck around"" when talking about unplanned pregnancies as if being a parent should be special. It used to be what you did, period.. but we have let it become so normal for a young parent to book it out of there that what used to be expected is not deserving of an award.

Ethical discussions determine whether the answer is to stop valuing the five year old's right to life or start valuing the dolphin's. Essentially, science _can_ tell us if certain distinctions we make for the purposes of establishing a particular moral theory are bunk.

Of course, they didn't equate dolphins and five year olds, since this wouldn't address whether or not being biased towards ones own species is something we should embrace or acknowledge or if it's something we should discourage or refuse. (But then again they did distinguish them as _non-human_ persons, so I'm kind of waffling on this particular part.).

**tl;dr:** Conclusions on the morality of other activities was probably editorializing a bit, but science actually _can_ repudiate ethical theories, and _should_ if the ideas they're repudiate spread false ideas about how the world works.

But one doesn't, because a system which represents a majority of users of a good does not account for the minority which must also use it. Keep your self-representatives to yourself, and I'll keep a system by which the value of currency is subject to the interests of *all* people using it, i.e, market value.

&gt;Competition in the money creation market could also be a good idea.

&gt;But Crowley decided to screen and pat down that assertion.  Citing an ABC report, Crowley said, “There are some major airports who had a 70 percent failure rate at detecting guns, knives, bombs, that they got through in your tests…. So how good can it be when you have major airports with a 70 percent fail rate?” Napolitano dismissed those results as old and questionable and said, “Let’s set those aside.” 

&gt;One of the real successes of the machines and procedures, Napolitano said, is that they discourage terrorists from even trying to get on planes. In other words, the machines keep us safe even if they don’t work at all.

&gt;“What we know is that you can’t measure [how] the devices … are deterring [terrorists] from going on a plane,” Napolitano said.  “Just people who just are discouraged, thinking they’d be found out,” said Crowley. “Exactly,” said Napolitano.

By the time terran was at the ramp, toss had 2 zealots and 1 stalker, well before 7 minutes. At the real ""7 minute"" mark toss had another 7 zealots and 2 stalkers.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","""But just saying that the burqa is immoral because it causes suffering is intellectually lazy on a complex question.""

Actually, I think you're the one being lazy here.  You are assuming that (a) Islamic fundamentalists are not actually interested in human well-being, and that, if so, this is not a moral failing, or (b) that the suffering and stultification of women does not really have any bearing on human well-being, or that (c) the sum total of well-being that is helped or hindered by such practices is unknowable through any scientific means.  Harris is making a case against all three of those, and you are disputing them without actually bothering to frame an argument.  

Are burka-level modesty, or religious tradition, or reverence for the patriarch, each a pure good in and of themselves?  Or are these all considered to be means to greater well-being (even if that well-being is supernatural)?  And can it be objectively true that that some means of attaining well-being might be more successful than others?  Is it objectively true that some sacrifices may not be worth it ultimately, that their pay-off in terms of human well-being might be a net loss?  

These are good questions, and they are not typically being asked by theists OR cultural relativists.  Or they are being asked and answered incorrectly without the benefit of weighing in evidence for or against them.   I think you know this on some level, which is why you say ""horrible as it may sound.""  Yes, it's horrible.  Because it's wrong.  Time to change that.  ","1293842114"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","&gt;When researchers ask women why they fake orgasm during intercourse, they mention doing so to avoid hurting their partner's feelings, to build their partner's egos, or to meet their partner's expectations.

And this is behavior that's not going to make their partner any better at getting them to orgasm or make their sex lives more enjoyable.

I can't speak for all men. I can only say that my ego will not be bruised if my partner doesn't orgasm. In fact, I've had sex with at least one woman who would let me know when she wasn't going to be able to (that was a fantastic relationship) and I feel like we had better sex because of it. The times she didn't orgasm didn't mean that she didn't enjoy the sex, quite the opposite. She just couldn't get there every time and at times couldn't even get herself to orgasm when she'd masturbate. But when she could get to orgasm, she could go multiple times.

And random soldiers doing their job protect Iraqis. I was securing an area for a controlled detonation (it was via time fuze you can't stop that once its set) and a bus driver with a full bus was dead set on breaking through.  He wouldn't stop with hand waving and kept coming directly towards me.  After drawing a bead on the vehicle, he stopped and the detonation took place.  Conceivably the driver could have killed everyone on the bus.  I took it upon myself to go out alone and control a road in that was left alone.  Of course I also made myself a prime kidnapping target doing that as well.

Soldiers do that daily in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of their jobs.  

All military personnel want out of the sand box as soon as possible and follow the rules of engagement to get out.  When a soldier breaks it he is generally made an example.

http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/hunting/shootingranges.asp

West Side Shooting Range was a little tricky to find (at least for me since I'm kinda new to the state). Route 33 is around Harrisonburg, follow it to WV and its a small road just inside the border heading north.

Hite Hollow is off Route 42 near Staunton. Augusta Springs to be more exact. Stuart Knob Ln turns into FDR 82, and the range is right where the road has a fork in it.

Think about this, if this idea ""makes business sense"", why not do it for music too?  I may only listen to a song once, why should I pay the same amount as someone who listens to it daily?

There is no shortage, there is no issue other than they are trying to cripple innovation.  Caps will stop people from using Netflix streaming, which will cause them to lose contracts with studios, which will lose more viewers.  OnLive will basically die for no other reason other than the fact that you're using so much data to stream a video game.  If caps were already a standard, do you really think OnLive would exist?  I forget the name of the other service that's starting the game streaming as well, but I can guarantee you capital would not be invested in any of these things, including online data storage, if there was a fear that consumers could be crippled from using it.

My point is that if you want to use the internet for something, you should be able to.  You should pay a flat rate, unless the company can show some kind of proof that you're somehow deteriorating the network for other customers, you shouldn't be treated any differently.

And I could understand if there were caps if they were fair in any way shape or form, in a perfect world, if you used less than, say, 5gb a month, you might pay $5.  But then if you want an unlimited plan, you could get that but it would cost what it does now, maybe $60 a month or so, depending on the speeds available to you.

The internet is integral to our lives now.  Like electricity, like phones, we do so much that involves the internet, we should be trying to grow everything related to it.  Whether it's infrastructure or extending service to get to other customers that can't currently get it.

Other countries can do this, but the ""greatest"" can't.","1293842215"

You are mistaken.

A mere ten months ago, the majority of discussions about Saydrah were about whether or not she deserved it, not whether or not crazy-ass psycho-doxing was an appropriate response to a perceived conflict of interest.  Of course, a mere ten months ago Reddit going full /b/tard was a rarity and something worthy of note.  By contrast I've been directly or indirectly involved in no less than 5 full-metal witch hunts in the past week. 

&gt;I can sum up kleinbl00's post in two words: ""be reasonable."" 

You are again mistaken.  Here's the TL;DR on that little diatribe:

###Demand reasonability from your fellow man. 

&gt;And that's not something everyone can be all the time. 

...and that's why the TL;DR is what *I* wrote, not what *you* wrote.  Yeah, people can't be reasonable all the time.  But the people who *can* be reasonable have a responsibility to rein in those who can't, because *today you, tomorrow me.*

Ya, I'm still heartbroken over my exgf. I've just been trying to get over her, get my confidence back.

&gt;She was 'good enough'.

Ya, she was the one who was upfront about not getting too involved... in fact we both agreed to stop seeing each other because I was developing feelings for her and that wasnt what she wanted. I was looking for a relationship.

&gt;How's it feel to do something selfish and not turn out to be what you wanted?

It's not about what I want or don't want, it's about how I was treated by this group of friends afterwards. It's about the lies they told before and after, and just the fact that they were not good friends to me.

&gt;Did you cry about it? Question your sexual orientation?


No, I didn't cry over this, but it makes me want to kill myself, it's no different than the lies my exgf told me after she left me. I just can't trust anyone, and people here are really insensitive and judge SO fucking fast. I'm disappointed in reddit right now. It didn't question my sexual orientation, actually. I was bi-curious once and am no longer, I know I'm straight. I've been raped by a male before, but it's not like that makes me question my sexuality either. I like gay people and I have fought for gay rights.

&gt;Plenty of girls are reserved about this at first.

Exactly why it took me so long to figure out.

I think that's a bit of a strawman, or at least, that's a strawman that was trotted out to me a lot when I was involved in religion - ""why do atheists have to be so hostile?"" Most of the anti-theist thought I've come across in articles, books, reddit, webcomics, etc, is angry and resentful just towards the institution. Sure, most people who could be classed as anti-theist (or at least anti religious involvement in personal life/politics) will do their best to call out specific people who are religious - but only for doing things that are wrong in the first place.

I have no doubt that we'll probably be seeing $4 and $5 gas in the United States in the near future, and I also have no doubt that the ""media"" is prepping the populace for the possibility (albeit not as an intentional conspiracy, more as a ""oh wow shocking story, news at 11!"" sort of way).

I'm not sure why you're defending him like you are - he was a dumbshit, and hopefully this was a relatively painless little lesson for him.

And before you say ""Oh don't call him a dumbshit, that's too harsh,"" let's examine one thing:

He knew he was lying, possibly trolling, possibly trying to give himself an ego boost by getting people to grant him kudos. Or maybe he just wanted to laugh at all the 'suckers.'

But here's the thing. Many, many redditors fall under the category of people who are still in the teacher/student relationship to some degree, and virtually everybody has at some point had a huge crush on their teacher. What this guy said, in essence, was: ""Hey guys, under the right circumstances this totally hot dream of yours can in fact come true!! If you can't make it happen to you, live out your fantasy vicariously through me!!!""

Then, when everybody finds out it was all a hoax, they will inevitably feel like somebody who drank what they thought was champagne, but turned out to be carbonated piss.

For lying to people who were likely to be vindictive of being laughed at, he was a complete dumbshit and deserved what he got.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","No. This is actually pretty awesome and elegant when you get it, but its a bit alienating at first. Picture this if you will:

 2C-B is fair more structurally similar to mescaline (trimethoxy-phenenthylamine), 2C-B is dimethoxy-phenethyamine with one of mescalines 3 methoxy's substituted for a single bromine atom on the 4 position, but aside for variations on that 4th carbon substitution on the ring its structurally identical to mescaline.

If you amphetamin-ize any phenethylamine [because a-m-phetamine means  alpha-methyl-phenethylamine] you add an alpha on the methyl.
An Amphetaminized version of 2C-B/Mescaline is either molecule plus a CH3 on the alpha position of the amine arm. These exist, and they are DOB/DOM respectively. Doing this makes them last a lot lot longer like 16-24 hours, with a slow 2 hour onset, and makes them potent in submiligram doses. If you were then to take that amphetaminized designer variant of 2C-B or Mescaline, and then make it a methamphetamine, you just add another Methyl (CH3) to the end of the Amine(NH2) so that the molecular NH2 tail becomes NH-CH3      now you have TMA (Trimethoxy-Methamphetamine) from mescaline which was trimethoxy phenethyalmine --&gt;DOM ---&gt; trimethoxy-amphetamine (the alpha methylated version ofphenylethylamine) --&gt; TMA--&gt; Trimethoxy methamphetamine (trimethoxy + alpha methyl + methyl on the amine (NH2--&gt;NHCH3)).

The similarly methamphetaminized version of 2C-B is called 2C-B-Fly due to the resemblance of the molecule. 

By comparison LSD is a complex tryptamine unrelated to phenthylamines but more like Psilocybin. But still more complex. And while MDMA is a phenthylamine (a methamphine actually, it also has a methylene dioxy bridge joining the 3&amp;4 positions of the primary ring (an O-CH2-O bridge), and is pretty dissimilar to 2C-B but shares a similar duration.


 alpha methylating (amtyrptaminizing them) a triptamine has a similar effect in comparison to regular tryptamines, like 4Hydroxy-DMT (psilocin, aka what psilocybin is activated to invovo) vs AMT/5-MeO-AMT which is edgy, much more potent, and lasts a long time taking time to kick  in.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","What people have been saying here so far has been pretty much correct, but I'll put it into my own words as well.

I can think of two ways to generate the charge buildup that leads to this static electricity.  Both deal with something rubbing up against something else, a phenomenon some physicists call [triboelectricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboelectricity).  (Some physicists just call it ""rubbing."")  

The first and most important contribution is probably from the air rubbing against the metal shell of the car.  In fact, much of the charge buildup that eventually causes lightning between clouds and the ground is generated by the wind rubbing against each of those.  The second contribution I can think of is a charge buildup generated from you rubbing the car seats.

This buildup means that there's a difference in charge between you and the shell of your car, so electrons (being such mobile charges) want to jump from one to the other.  

&gt;I know that the air is dryer during the winter, but why exactly does this lead to anything becoming more charged?

There's more charge buildup in the winter because the air is drier, and polar water vapor molecules are pretty good at slowly siphoning excess charge off of things.  In fact, in our intro physics labs, we have this electrostatics lab that only works magnificently in the winter.  Alas.

&gt;Is it just the metal exterior of the car that is charged? And is it positively or negatively charged (or does it depend)? Do YOU have a charge of your own that is partly to blame for the spark? 

I suppose it doesn't really matter who has the charge, just that there is some charge difference.  Both you and the metal of the car are somewhat good conductors, but you both are somewhat insulated from ground (the car is insulated by its rubber tires, and you're probably insulated by your shoes).  You may also be wearing clothing that is a good insulator, and has built up charge from rubbing against the seat.  I don't really know which would pick up which charge, but only the different really matters for the effect to occur.

&gt;Is it electrons (or some other charged particles?) physically moving through the air from the car to my finger? From my finger to the car?

Whichever way goes from the one with more negative charge to the one with more positive charge.  Sorry I can't say more.

&gt;And this causes friction with the air, making it heat up and emit visible light? Why is it blue (if it even truly is)? Does it emit light beyond the visible spectrum as well? And why would all the charged particles follow the same path, especially since they should all be repelling, not attracting, each other?

Not quite... let's say that you have a large negative charge on you (lots of electrons) and the car is, say, neutral, for this argument.  As you get near the car, the car will slightly polarize and the region of the car that's near you will have a net positive charge, since the electrons in that region are repelled by your excess negative charge.  A bunch of net negative charge on one side and a bunch of net positive charge on the other side, separated by a small gap, create a strong electric field between them.  Air is a good insulator... but there's a maximum amount of field it can handle, called the [dielectric breakdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_breakdown) of air.  

Once the electric field gets stronger than this value, the neutral molecules of air can no longer resist creating an electrical pathway between you and the car.  The electrons flow from you to the absence of negative charge on the car, in a current that ionizes the air in the pathway.  (Think of it like suddenly forming a wire between you and the car, a path of low resistance through the air.)  This goes until you and the car are roughly equilibriated.

The light you see is given off by the air molecules which rapidly deionize/reionize.  It emits strongly as a bluish light because that corresponds to the energy of the photons given off when the molecule deionizes... but you would have to ask someone else what the full spectrum is.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; That's basically the ML/pattern-match solution.

Yes, except that ML and Haskell pattern matching works the other way around. To do the mammal/lion example you'd do this:

    def foo(Lion x): return 1
    def foo(Mammal x): return 2

This doesn't work with Haskell/ML ordering because now you can't add additional methods on other subclasses later.

&gt; It's also worth noting that defining methods is done imperatively in Magpie. 

Right, so the equivalent policy is to dispatch in the reverse order in time in which the methods are defined.

That is, translate this:

    def foo(x Bar) f(x)

To this:

    var oldfoo = foo
    foo = fn(x) if isa(x,Bar) then f(x) else oldfoo(x)

Edit: note that Bar in the above example could really be any object that supports the isa method. For example if you defined isa on predicates T -&gt; bool:

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","It is good advice, except: If it has gone to collections, do NOT send them a letter offering to ""pay it in full."" Negotiate with them so that you pay less. Once it's gone to collections, they bought your debt from the original creditor for pennies on the dollar and don't necessarily expect to get the full price back. Plus, who knows what kind of fake inflated fees they have added in there.

So, instead, send them a letter offering to pay 1/4 to 1/3 of it in a lump sum to consider it settled in full and removed from your credit report. See what their counter offer is. This will save you some money and repair your credit the same as if you had paid in full [it's reported the same way].

Get it all in writing. If they keep reporting it after you pay them, send them a threatening letter that says you will sue them for violation of the FDCPA (assuming you live in the USA) if they do not remove it from your credit report, since you paid them &amp; that was the agreement. You don't actually have to be prepared to sue or speak to a lawyer; reminding them of their fuck up should be enough for them to stop being so lazy.","1293842368"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Continental breakfasts at hotels are great. Watch out for parking, though; quite often you need a permit to park in their garage and you don't want to come out to see your vehicle being towed! Find somewhere legal to park, then wander into the hotel, avoiding the front desk if you can. It's easiest to get in from the parking garage or a side entrance. I've also stayed at some hotels connected to shopping malls -- easy access.

Grab a few packs of baby wipes in case you can't shower daily (although the gym membership is a great asset to have for this adventure!).

Bread + peanut butter + jelly = easy meals that require no refrigeration. Stay hydrated; water jugs are easily refillable.

Stick to middle class areas. The poorer parts of town will get you robbed, and rich people call the cops on folks who loiter.

Walmart is usually cool with people camping in their parking lot, as long as they don't look like hobos and move on after a few days (don't set up permanent camp). Be careful which Walmart you choose, though. Shitty areas can get dangerous at night. Our local Walmart had over 300 police calls last year.

Does the trunk of your car open from the interior? If this access folds relatively flat, you can put your legs in the trunk and stretch out across the backseat.

Rest stops are also a common place for travelers to sleep, but be careful choosing one. Don't roll your window down for knocks in the night and tell anyone who needs a ride to fuck off. I lost my cousin after he offered to help two guys at a truck stop ... their car ""broke down"" and they just needed a short ride. They shot him in the head instead.

Above all, stay with your car when you can and don't let it get towed. You can go from a month-long adventure to sleeping under an overpass overnight if you lose the car.

Hang in there, and good luck!","1293842368"

This wasn't really how I pictured it...which is why I think one of the reasons people don't, or can't, get into the ""holiday mood"" is because they expect it to be a certain way and when the standards don't hold up, it's hard to get into the mood.

&gt;I have changed the numbers on my watch,  
And now perhaps something else will change.  
Now perhaps  
At precisely 2a.m.  
You will not get up  
And gathering your things together  
Go forever.  
Perhaps now you will find it is  
Far too early to go,  
Or far too late,  
And stay forever

Given the prices you're probably just better off buying a Mobo and CPU with support for DDR2 RAM you already have. Your CPU and motherboard are probably about 6 years old in terms of technology. I think it's time to retire them.

For instance you can get this [motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813186155) and this [Athlon II x2 2.8Ghz CPU](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103677) for total $83.

The child porn one we already talked about. The other one is not banned at all. You should be able to find that out by simply logging out and looking for it. But you didn't, and you made up some wild accusation to hide the fact that your posts are pro-child porn.

We discussed this before - we don't approve of child porn, we will never approve of child porn, there will never be a discussion of child porn. It is a ridiculous concept to think that the spread and production of child pornography reduces child abuse, because it takes child abuse in order to produce child pornography.

But it still seems wrong to me.

And I don't mean this to sound judgemental in any way. Please don't take it as that. I'm just expressing where I stand.

Then, in the chapter's endnote, he quietly admitted that ""[o]bviously, in a free society, Smith has the ultimate decision-making power over his own just property, Jones over his, etc."" [6]

&gt; Opps. How did the editor not pick up that one? But it shows the magical power of the expression ""private property"" - it can turn the bad (""ultimate decision-making power"" over a given area) into the good (""ultimate decision-making power"" over a given area). 

That is the dumbest thing I have ever read.  It shows a clear lack of ability to understand the topic at hand.  Rothbard claims that the government as ultimate owner of everything is Bad, while each individual owning his own is good.  It's absolutely unfathomable to me how this garbage is even taken literally.

Remember when Al Gore (among others) said we'd have more hurricanes in the US, pointing at the 2005 season with 15 hurricanes?

Look what happened after that, the number of hurricanes went down again.

Pointing at a single event and saying it is proof of a trend only serves to give your opponents more ammunition when the later single events seem to indicate different or no trend.

The variance in weather is so large compared to the actual change in climate that you can't just point at one thing and say ""see, I told you so"".","1293842521"

Although this is a study of the Sermon on the Mount, we must remember that Matthew 5 is not the last word on the subject of divorce. What we learn here is only part of the picture.](http://www.gci.org/bible/matthew5)

"shittyadvice","t5_2rch1","You have to defeat one of the current officers and take his place.  What they don't tell you is that the secret service is a tribal organization and to get in you have to kick someone out.  Only the strong survive so good luck.  Let me give you some tips in order to make sure you get in.

First you have to get the uniform of a contender.  You can get one [here](http://www.alhannah.com/islamic_clothing_mens/muslim_outfits.html).  Don't be too flashy or you'll likely be discarded for your inability to keep a low profile.

The selection process begins on the white house lawn at 2:47:30pm on Wednesdays when the sun is not shining.  As you enter the property you should begin sizing up your opponents to determine who is going to enter the ring of death with you.  Once you have chosen you should make clear your intentions by pointing at your opponent and using your boom box to play the [song of the epic callout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM0ZAMGwyiM&amp;feature=related).  As the song begins to play you immediately put on the [hat of the great contender](http://www.alhannah.com/products/me518.html).  This will show them that you are ready to join their ranks.  Provided you have performed your preselection properly the first person to reach you will be the agent that you have chosen.  For the first 30 seconds you may only engage the agent with your head.  Numerous battles have been won at this stage without it even progressing to stage two.  However if your opponent has a very hard head or your are weak then it will progress.  At this point you have to keep track of where you are because there will be much screaming.  The other members of the tribe will be cheering on their member because you are still an outsider.  If you are able to kick three spectators in the groin you will likely neutralize this advantage.  At this point you should be well on your way to domination.  Engage with every last bit of your soul... call upon the 3 wolf moon if you need that last burst of strength and finish your opponent.  They will cuff you and drag you inside.  This is a cover so that not everyone knows how new agents are selected.  Once you are inside they will welcome you into the tribe and shun the defeated.  I have spoken too much but take this information and go forth!","1293842562"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Much of my research focuses on the structure of neutron stars. A neutron star isn't made of just neutrons, but is in an equilibrium caused by the weak interaction. In the simplest picture there are two processes. Beta decay causes neutrons to decay into protons, electrons and anti-neutrinos. Reverse beta decay causes electrons and protons to create neutrons and neutrinos. 

    N -&gt; e + P + \bar{\nu_e}
    P + e -&gt; N + \nu_e

These two processes are know collectively at the *Urca processes*. The neutrinos generated during these processes are responsible for the cooling of the neutron star. Because they only interact weakly, neutrinos freely stream out of the star. 

The whole process means that the star is actually in a chemical equilibrium where the chemical potential of the neutron is equal to the sum of the electron and proton chemical potentials,

    \mu_N = \mu_e + \mu_P 

Along with the fact that the star must be charge neutral, we get a neutron star composition consisting of neutrons with about 5% protons.

As for the first one, well... I don't believe in a cosmic scale balancing things out.  There's no intrinsic reward for doing the right thing and evil doers do not always get what's coming to them.  If you are a nice person, though, odds are you will be thought well of and you'll end up being friends with equally nice people.  If you're jerk that goes around backstabbing people, odds are the people you associate with may not be on the up and up.

Actually, I guess that does answer both your questions.   Causation does not equal correlation.  You can draw relationships between things and it can make a kind of sense, but that doesn't make it necessarily correct.  A good person usually is surrounded by good people and good things tend to happen to them.  It's not because they're a good person.  It's just an effect of *being* a good person.

A billion years of natural selection will make anything seem amazingly adapted to its environment. We exist on the Earth because we *can* exist. If conditions were different, we wouldn't be here.  It's not a miracle and there's not a plan.  It just is.

So rather than pass on all the cost of taxes to consumers, corporations can grow their value tax free by reinvesting their profits in the business.  Lowering corporate taxes reduces the value of this tax shelter, thus encouraging profit taking among owners / shareholders.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","to add to this, matching values specifically, if, say you're working in a 32bit environment so all color values range from 0(no color or black) to 1(full color or white) you can make good assumptions based on this. 

If for example you are trying to blend in something you can go through the individual color grades of highlights midtones and shadows and blend each color point, whit/black point to be equivalent to the source material this means nothing exceeds the brightest bright or the darkest dark in each luminance range. This alone will help immediately. Adding in lighting and making sure your cg has proper lighting really helps. Understanding source direction be it from simple understanding of the shot or by using even the simplest HDRI images to map onto your object help a lot. 

If you get a chance, for example, to look back at Aliens (I say this since I recently just watched it) most of the VFX is done very well. Mostly with models, infact 99% of it is some sort of practical trick and multiple image scans etc. The biggest flaw in the whole movie is the landing ships. When it moves not only is it missing any sign of glowing engines (which may not exist in the world of the movie, but we as the audience have come to expect as much, star wars and startrack provided us with these concepts) the movment of the ship it self is off, but also the lighting is WAY Off. The ship passes under a structure, which is really just a matte painting, but instead of any shadows passing over it nothing happens. This may not be readily obvious to joe everyman watching the film, but in his mind he knows something is wrong or off. ","1293842657"

The only way the United States is going to change this way of living is if the price of fuel rises to the point where change is forced upon us.  And it's just a matter of time, since 'cheap oil' is a finite resource.  We (Americans) can start changing now, slowly and steadily over time to prepare for this future, or we can go through a world of hurt many years down the road when we are forced to adapt over a short period of time.  Frankly, I prefer the former.

Did I ask the wrong questions?  Again, I'm not doubting there are benefits.  If I did I would ask questions.  I'm sorry the conversation wasn't steered in a direction favorable to you.

If any area of the country is hospitable to bare feet, it would be here.  Right now in DC the sidewalks are filled with salt.  My dog (who does walk around bare foot all the time), has stepped on the salt and hurt his paws twice this week already.  Just as you are not bare foot all the time, I'm not in shoes all the time.  When I worked at a summer camp our tents were set up over gravel.  It was impossible to walk to and from our tents with shoes off, I tried.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Global cooling was a conjecture during the 1970s of imminent cooling of the Earth's surface and atmosphere along with a posited commencement of glaciation. This hypothesis had mixed support in the scientific community, but gained temporary popular attention due to a combination of press reports that did not accurately reflect the scientific understanding of ice age cycles, and a slight downward trend of temperatures from the 1940s to the early 1970s. In contrast to the global cooling conjecture, the current scientific opinion on climate change is that the Earth has not durably cooled, but undergone global warming throughout the twentieth century.[1]

If that sounds insane, that's because it is.

"electronics","t5_2qhue","Many contacts (including in organs) are plated with a protective thin layer of a non-oxidizing metal. You have likely removed that layer, so the bad news is they will corrode over time no matter what you do.

The ""proper"" way to clean them is with a burnishing tool which uses an extremely fine abrasive to just polish the contact surface.

*    http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/GC-ELECTRONICS-9337-/22-910

For many techs, aerospace, sound engineers, etc,  the best contact cleaners and protectants have long been considered to be the Deoxit line made by Caig Labs. They are widely available (even Radio Shack), although, like any other good product in this day and age, the line has been expanded into a confusing array of products, so I can't speak for all the varieties. Pick one of the basic products. The paste types work the best for things like your contacts, although it takes some care to apply them. Below is a link to their website for reference, and also a link to one of their products specifically for musical instruments.

Edit: Almost forgot - Fluxes. While I have never heard of using flux as a contact protectant, and I don't know for sure whether it would help or not. I think it would hinder ratehr than help. Flux is by it's nature a corrosive chemical and I would think that even a rosin flux would tend to corrode the metal over time. And, beware, the flux you buy in the big box store , unless specifically for electrical work, is ACID based flux. That definitely WILL destroy your contacts.","1293842863"

The car's rubber tires insulate it from ground, but you conduct current to ground much better. You bring your finger near and a brief [electric arc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc) forms in the air. As the electrons flow through the air they strike molecules in the air (mostly nitrogen gas). This collision may knock electrons away from those molecules, ionizing them. As the electrons return to their ground state the energy from their excitation is [emitted as photons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized_air_glow).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to read a hundred times, but take it from this old library rat, I've spent my entire adult life in the library, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

If you only train one part of your mind (and that's all a single exercise like reading is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.

Reading basically only trains the imagination and to some extent, the eyes. What you really want to do is train your entire mind, all the major lobes (imagination, logic, argument, rhetoric) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your emotional work!

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with thinking, being rational, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find a good library, with qualified librarians who will design your reading programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for mental fitness. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being the most articulate the first time you walk into the library. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

Now get out there and do it! :-)","1293842874"

"gonewild","t5_2qq5c","The frena took months.  I'd guess 2-3 for one and 5 or 6 for the other - one of them just never *quite* healed and very slowly migrated out.  The other one was pretty well healed, then I caught it on something and it tore a little bit.  From that point on, one side of it slowly migrated and the thing became ridiculously lopsided, so I wound up taking it out.

I lost two hafadas, too, both two migration.  The two on the right side are fine, but the two on the left, again, very slowly worked their way to the surface.

IIRC, the frena and the hafadas are the only ones I've done/had done that grew out.  I had a helix that never quite healed, but as it was through cartilage, it couldn't easily reject, so I took it out after about 8 months.  Most of the rest of my piercings are, uh... I don't know the name - straight through pieces of flesh - septum, tongue, PA, tragus, daith, etc.

re: PA - that one's never going to go away - likewise the septum.  I had that one up just beyond a 2ga for a while and like the PA, I've gone years without wearing anything in it and I know I can still get an 8ga in without blinking and could probably force a 6ga through.  The tongue's the only one I have that would probably close up of its own volition, and I only say that because I don't know how the tongue muscle behaves long-term.

One of the disadvantages of it is you can forget that you're one Mark David Chapman away from a very bad day.

L'il story:  My wife is a naturopathic doctor.  She had a very famous person whom is often talked about on this very website call her up complaining of fatigue and weakness.  My wife immediately asked if this person had had any blood tests done.  The person replied that they hadn't, but their previous doctor ""had a machine where you held your hand up to the screen and it told you what was wrong with you.""

The folx in /r/skeptic are the types that endorse blood tests over magic palm-reading machines.  Yet because they have so much hatred and so little understanding of the word ""naturopathic"" they consider my wife and the charlatan who preceded her to be intellectually equivalent and wish both to be burned as heretics on the cross of science.

Sure. There's no god or universal judge that's going to tell you ""you violated my law."" There are tons of people that kill animals for necessity, it would be ignorant of this universe-judge to make life in such a way that it evolves to survive by methods it would later deem ""unethical."" Now if you want to reduce the suffering on Earth and never make the choice to eat animal products, I see that as a conscious choice. However, we make choices that kill animals every day, including vegans (with varying degrees of culpability, all the way to stepping on them to killing them on their windshield). Should one feel just as guilty killing an animal in that manner as they would if they directly chopped a turkey's head off? Why the disparity in guilt there? Because if you want to tell me its a consistent and universal law then you should feel equally guilty. In other words, if you see a bug squished on your windshield and don't give a fuck, you should be able to do the same to a chicken and not give a fuck either.

The guy calmly told the cops that he had not been drinking, that he wanted to pull over somewhere safe, that he did not want them searching his car, that he did not have any drugs, etc...

"reddit.com","t5_6","Alright chump, you're a serious dumbass because you apparently didn't read the post.

Let me drop some knowledge on your ignorant ass:

1) OP's original complaint was intended as feedback for the Secret Santa program....it was not their intention to loudly complain to the whole community. It was made in good faith, so trying to fault them for ""complaining"" is just completely invalid. They were giving feedback....feedback which is vital for the SS program by the way.

2) It's not like someone went out and bought a sweater and now OP is bitching because they don't like the color.

No...if their description is accurate it's clear that their SS half-assed it hardcore.....no-assed it even. This is an abuse of the program, an insult to the community, and something the organizers need to be made aware of, if only so they know that it does in fact happen.

What OP's secret santa basically did was put a turd in a box, wrap it up and call it a gift...and now jackasses like you are braying ""HURR DURR DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT A GIFT!!!"".

This person sent them a crufty old purse with a couple pieces of DIRTY and hand-labeled candy. This is clearly not up to the standard of what an SS gift should be.


Remember the old saying:

It's the THOUGHT that counts.

That's the problem here, NO thought or effort was put into OP's gift...and damn right they can bring that up.

It's not like the secret santa spent a lot of time making something and OP is complaining because the secret santa is a shitty artist.....no the person put no thought/time into it.","1293843004"

Or maybe you do read those books, and then get angry and call the book pseudo-intellectual, or maybe a prick.

And no, for your information, you didn't accept you were wrong. You made an edit that didn't actually change the fact that what you had written was wrong. I pointed this out and instead of saying ""whoops"" you got angered by the multiple paragraphs.

Oh gosh look here's another paragraph! I sure hope none follow this one, as only a pseudo intellectual prick would type **more than one paragraph**.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","* LWJGL has more than enough demos to get you started. You can also try ciardhubh.de's LWJGL port of the NeHe OpenGL tutorials. You'll be able to port any OpenGL demos on the web once you're comfortable with LWJGL. I can't over-emphasize the need to learn about display lists and multi texturing.

* For 3D games, the most important thing after a graphics library is a good binary space partitioning scheme. It's important because you can use the same BSP in your rendering, ray casting and collision detection functions. Remember: Always render back to front if you plan to blend any transparent textures.

* For physics, look up RK4. Run your game at a fixed physics time step and use linear interpolation for smooth motion at a variable frame rate.

* For dynamically generated levels, read up on Perlin noise and Simplex noise. It's really that easy.

* Multiplayer really just requires serialization between client and server. If you know how to use sockets in any language, then you already know enough to get started. If you have no experience with this, try reading the Circle mud source code.

p.s. I started my own game first person Java game 3.5 months ago. As of today my LWJGL demo includes an procedurally generated world with momentum-based physics, doors, ladders, torches, tons of crafting recipes, melee and ranged combat, dynamic lighting, and thanks to some tuning this past week it now runs at more than twice the frame rate of Minecraft.

I still have a few weeks of work left on the single player engine, and then I'm going to kick the actual game development into high gear. I'll release a demo once I've added enough unique features for it to be seen as Minecraft's peer rather than its clone.","1293843006"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Hatchjaw brings forward his rather facile and ever-ready theory of forgery, pointing to certain unfamiliar syntactical constructions in the first part of the third so called 'prosecanto' of the image.

He does not, however, suggest that there is anything spurious in the ""*Redit*"" artist's equally damaging rhodomontade in the *Layman's Atlas* where he inveighs savagely against 'the insanitary conditions prevailing everywhere after six o'clock' and makes the famous *gaffe* that death is merely 'the collapse of the heart from the strain of a lifetime of fits and fainting'. 

Bassett (in Lux Mundi) has gone to considerable pains to establish the date of these passages and shows that Redit was hors de combat from his long-standing gall-bladder disorders at least immediately before the passages were composed. One cannot lightly set aside Bassett's formidable table of dates and his corroborative extracts from contemporary newspapers which treat of an unnamed 'elderly man' being assisted into private houses after having fits in the street. For those who wish to hold the balance for themselves, Henderson's Hatchjaw and Bassett is not unuseful. Kraus, usually unscientific and unreliable, is worth reading on this point.

Anyway. The 'ticker' iterates through the collection of active timers, advances them and checks if their actions should be run at that moment. So why not have that collection accessable to userlevel code instead of makeing all timers each a hidden GC root?","1293843031"
"linux","t5_2qh1a","I see the PS3 as the most popular and used blu-ray player if it is cracked I can decrypt and watch blu-ray movies on my Linux PC.  I would be able to watch all current Blu-Rays and all future ones unless Sony blocks the PS3 from playing all new blu-rays.  When the HD-DVD DRM was hacked using the Xbox 360 HD-DVD player they couldn't really do anything about it.  As far as the Gaming DRM, it needs to be cracked for emulators to be made to play PS3 Games.  When Playstation 5 comes out without backwards compatibility and all the PS3s are for the most part broken/ hard to find how will you play your old games?  Emulators preserve the history of gaming and keep old games alive and prevents culture Lock-Out.  It also is a safe gard allowing for you to play your games that you bought even if the hardware breaks.  Take the XBox 360, if Microsoft doesn't release a XBox 360 is red rings of death resistant, then within three years of the end of production there will be hardly any xbox 360s around.  If an emulator is made you could just play the games on a PC.  Similarly the same goes for the PS3(except I expect the hardware to last longer).  So it isn't useless cracking the PS3 Game DRM.  

EDIT also cracking the game DRM might allow you to launch the PS3 games from the PS3 linux making the gameOS not needed at all","1293843032"

I am lifelong atheist and longtime Buddhist. 

I just use the word ""karma"" as shorthand for ordinary naturalistic cause and effect. If you drive drunk, you're likely to hurt somebody. If you study hard, you're likely to do well on your test. 

&gt;Second, a more important question, how does atheism reply(or criticize) to someone says that because the world looks so intelligently desined, then there must be a god. 

They're wrong. 

We don't really have anything to compare the world to. Maybe it's not really all that ""intelligently designed"" at all. 

When people talk about intelligent design of the world, they're referring to order and regular patterns. If there weren't a certain amount of order and regular patterns, it wouldn't be possible for us to exist.  If we didn't exist, we wouldn't be wondering about this. ","1293843039"

I've been called worse things and typically people don't *really* mean Nazi when they say it, I don't think they really think about the darkness and depravity that the word conjures. However, in this case I don't think it's all that inappropriate because he's not outright calling them Nazis. I agree they are not Nazi's, they are not apart of that party, however, they are persecutors of the Palestinians. 

As I said earlier, Jewish people can be persecutors even though they at one time were the persecuted. (Though of course not all Jews are Zionists or vice-versa.) 

I understand why and agree that it will probably anger people, but it does show the irony of the situation: That the Jewish people who escaped the horrors of the Holocaust and found refuge in Palestine would have no guilt about going on to marginalize and slowly get rid of the Palestinian people. All so that they can have their ""promised land"" because they are gods chosen people. 

Yes, yes, the Holocaust was terrible and the Jewish people were victimized, but what the Zionists are doing now to the Palestinians is sick. And if they can get away with it, (and they have so far, because people see them as victims) they would happily kill all the Palestinians to get what they want: the land that they occupy.

&gt;Perhaps most importantly, how often do you compare the actions of other oppressive states to that of the Nazis?

To answer your question I would have no problem calling the U.S. or any other country Nazi-esque when it's appropriate, and it seems that recently it is becoming more and more so.","1293843041"

Keep your stuff in your house, locked up. Never take out more than you are going to sell in one run. Don't take on new customers.

Don't carry multiple drugs, baggies, scales, etc because that will get you charged with distribution.

An undercover cop will usually come in the form of a ""buddy"" you've never met of one of your customers who is looking for some stuff. The money has to come from him and the drugs have to go to him in order for it to be considered a buy. Your regular customer will not be handling drugs/money unless absolutely necessary. 

They usually prefer to make their deals in public places such as parking lots, however they will come into your house to make a deal. 

The undercover will try to get your name and number from you in order to continue making more buys, after this point you will probably not see your old customer with the undercover for any more buys, as your customer probably does not want to be any further associated with this guy in your mind.

The cops will usually have another car stationed in a nearby parking lot that will follow you to get your plate number and see where you go.

Undercover cops will never engage in an illegal activity such as smoking weed with you.

You can't base anything upon appearances. One of the undercovers I worked with looked to be 20 years old, had piercings, tattoos, and gauged ears. The other undercover I worked with was a black guy in his mid-20s who dressed like your typical street black guy with fresh sneakers and everything. Neither of these guys actually knew too much about drug slang and were actually incredibly awkward during the deals that I set up.

The cops will not always need to set up undercover buys from you in order to bust you. When I was busted, the cops stormed my car, pulled me out, slammed me to the ground and arrested me. They then impounded my car, got a search warrant and found my drugs and money. I had never even sold to an undercover. A couple texts from my phone to a girl's phone that was in her dads possession who then turned it over to the police was enough to set me up, arrest me for suspicion and then search my car.

When you get busted the cops will always tell you they were tapping phones, etc, in order to get you thinking off track of suspecting the undercover and your customer that set you up. They will be very nice to you and tell you you can probably go home if you talk to them. Don't talk to them. I would be in prison right now if I had. Go to jail, get a lawyer, and figure it out from there.","1293843060"

Consider the way government handles airport security. All the wasteful, stupid shit the TSA does would not be done if the airlines handled their own security. The reason is the government doesn't pay the cost for its stupid, irrational behavior, but a private firm does. Government agents get paid no matter how bad they behave, because the government gets its money the old fashioned way - extortion and robbery. Private firms must convince people to hand over their money voluntary, and that means making the customer happy, which automatically rules out stupid, irrational restrictions like the ones you're suggesting.

The earliest citation comes from Sir William Hope’s The Compleat Fencing-Master, second edition, 1692, page 157: ""What he doth, he doth by rule of thumb, and not by art.""[1][2] The phrase also exists in other languages, for example Swedish tumregel, Norwegian tommelfingerregel, sometimes in the variant ""rule of fist"", for example Finnish nyrkkisääntö, German Faustregel or Dutch vuistregel.

As far as what really ""does it"" for a pedophile, as long as they aren't approaching the kids or otherwise actively trying to engage with them sexually then who cares? What if seeing kids at the park ""does it"" for them, or watching a mom grocery shop with their child in the cart, would you recommend people not take their kids out in public for fear that a pedophile could see them and get excited?

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Essentially, there needs to be real democracy in Venezuela. He's got his hands in a lot of pockets so assuring his stay in power is not very difficult task. He's not the right man for the job, he's too arrogant and is more interested in leaving a legacy than providing a service to Venezuelans. It's my belief that if your primary concern isn't with the people, then you have no place being in power. 

A better foreign trade policy; all that oil Venezuela is sitting on has allowed Venezuelans to purchase oil at an incredibly low price: somewhere in the ballpark of [a] nickel(s) per gallon. That's all well and good, but it's serving little purpose if you can't even afford a car. That oil can do far better if it's being traded among countries and using the revenue from it to create jobs in building infrastructure, energy and the like. I remember as a kid, driving cross-country in a car at no price for the oil, but on roads with so many potholes you couldn't stay at reasonable speed for very long. 

Chavez dips his hand into all business matters of the people directly. I don't think it should be that way. Not ""take from the rich, give to the poor."" That's a stupid model. That's not the socialism I believe in. I believe in providing jobs or the environment to support jobs as well as basic life necessities to all people (housing, health, education). His method of redistribution is like grabbing a chunk of cheese from one man and putting it through a cheese-grater until it's all to a pulp and no one can benefit from it. As a result, people like my father, who provide jobs for respectable laborers, have less to pay workers, providing less jobs in the community.

Went back to play it a few months ago, I did a refresher on the story, using a guide, but I couldn't get to grips with the battle system. They kinda assume you're going to do the whole lot while it's still in your recent memory, you need to build up a certain knowledge of how to play the game.

I've learned from this, and I now only start an RPG if I know I have enough time to fully commit to it.","1293843136"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; Is it possible to shave or re-shape bones without surgery?

.

&gt; Cut the skin open (surgeons do it, why can't I?) and use a chisel to shave the bone to the correct shape.

That would be surgery.  You don't have the knowledge, skill and experience.  Odds are you would end horribly disfiguring yourself if you were lucky.  If you were unlucky, infection, amputation, death.

You know how the first time you try something you typically do a pretty shitty job?  Or maybe you do an OK job but it takes a really long time?  Well you don't have plenty of time during surgery.  You can't scrap your project and start over with new stuff if you screw up.

Do yourself a big favor and see a plastic surgeon.  Get a price estimate and save up for it.

I also noticed that you are electing to go through a sex change.

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ernk7/im_an_incoming_female_read_transgender_and_want/c1avjk7

For part of this process, you are supposed to be seeing a therapist to make sure you are adjusting right.  Please talk this over with a therapist.  Start seeing one if you are not already.  That mere fact that you are considering self surgery is a huge red flag that you are not thinking things through all the way.  For all we know you are over obsessing about a perfectly beautiful feature you have.

Many transsexuals who don't feel they can afford proper surgery have done a lot of horrible disfiguring things to their body in attempts to do it yourself.  The most notable are when transsexuals inject themselves with silicon because they can't afford boob jobs or facial reconstruction.

Please don't let this happen to you.  Do it right.  Get it done well by professionals.  Don't turn yourself into a walking monster.  See examples below.

But his right to do so is derived from his nature as man and from the function of moral values in human life— and, therefore, is applicable only in the context of a rational, objectively demonstrated and validated code of moral principles which define and determine his actual self-interest. It is not a license “to do as he pleases” and it is not applicable to the altruists’ image of a “selfish” brute nor to any man motivated by irrational emotions, feelings, urges, wishes or whims.""

Another example would be a percent score. 18.2% can also be written as 18.2/100 (18.2 out of 100), both of which have 3 sig. figures. As long as the context makes it obvious that we're talking about percent scores, we don't need to know the precision of 100 to get the right answer.","1293843161"

&gt;The constitutionality of an airport screening search, however, does not depend on consent, see Biswell, 406 U.S. at 315, and requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post-9/11 world. Such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by ""electing not to fly"" on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found. This rule would also allow terrorists a low-cost method of detecting systematic vulnerabilities in airport security, knowledge that could be extremely valuable in planning future attacks. Likewise, given that consent is not required, it makes little sense to predicate the reasonableness of an administrative airport screening search on an irrevocable implied consent theory. Rather, where an airport screening search is otherwise reasonable and conducted pursuant to statutory authority, 49 U.S.C. § 44901, all that is required is the passenger's election to attempt entry into the secured area of an airport. See Biswell, 406 U.S. at 315; 49 C.F.R. § 1540.107. Under current TSA regulations and procedures, that election occurs when a prospective passenger walks through the magnetometer or places items on the conveyor belt of the x-ray machine. The record establishes that Aukai elected to attempt entry into the posted secured area of Honolulu International Airport when he walked through the magnetometer, thereby subjecting himself to the airport screening process.

&gt;To the extent our cases have predicated the reasonableness of an airport screening search upon either ongoing consent or irrevocable implied consent, they are overruled.","1293843190"

If a name is mispronounced I still feel it's *wrongly* mispronounced, and similarly mistranslated would be *wrong* in my opinion. In this current age we *do* understand how to pronounce most recorded names correctly, including Yeshua, and thus should do so.. especially if it's the name of what a person may believe is their god or son of their god.

WoW is pictured as the soulsucking, life destroying MMO mostly because it's really really huge. Every MMO, heck every GAME, has a bunch of people who get absolutely absorbed by it to a point where they neglect everything else, but with WoW the number of absorbed people is about as huge as the number of people playing other games *in total* just because the number of people playing it at all is absurdly high.","1293843218"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","This past spring I realized something that I had always known but never acted upon, namely that being obese was making me incredibly unhappy, for all the usual reasons. Over the summer, I joined an Ultimate Frisbee league, and started swimming again, one of those long lost joys of childhood. At first it was pathetic - I could maybe run at top speed from one end of the field to the other and back in Frisbee before I just had to stop, and 70 year olds in the lane next to me would lap me over and over and over. I had qualified for the junior olympics in swimming when I was younger, what happened to me? I joined Fittit, which was a major step. I learned all sorts of things about diet and exercise. About a week before my birthday in July, I started my first real diet and I kept it really, really simple: I told myself, no soda, no candy, no snacks. Three meals a day. Less than 1000 calories per meal. I stuck with that the whole summer and what do you know - I went from 290 in early June to 260 by the beginning of October. By then, school had started and I was distracted. After a few weeks with no decrease in weight, I became discouraged: ""It was so easy over the summer, but now nothing's happening."" I realized I needed to stick to an even tougher diet and needed to start exercising regularly, a few games of ultimate a week simply wasn't going to cut it. Down to a new and improved under 2k calories a day plan that I made with the help of reddit and starting the couch to 5k program, I started making progress again. Today, I'm at 250 lbs, having lost about 40lbs in half a year. I'm going to be running my first 5k next week (wish me luck). Most importantly I learned two things about myself: I'm not going to go back. I can't even imagine being the person I was 6 months ago. I'm happier, more confident, and the last 6 months have taught me that I absolutely can do it. Secondly, I've realized that even seemingly insurmountable goals can be achieved through small bits of progress every single day. I know I'm not done, and I know that this journey is never going to stop. But you know what? I can't wait to see myself in another 6 months and another year. ","1293843222"

&gt;Setups like this is where I get this idea that Libertarianism requires Socialism to exist.

Then you are misunderstanding libertarianism.  It does not require socialism.  It encompasses voluntary socialism as well as every other societal and governmental arrangement that is not forced on anyone.

&gt;I wanted to make a pithy statement about the nature of Libertarianism in relation to Socialism, but to do so I needed a clearer definition of Libertarianism to start from.

Well, you said we were talking about utopias and end goals, not journeys.  In that case things like smaller government, lower taxes, and fewer legislated regulations aren't what we are talking about.  They are just steps in the direction of a world that fits within libertarian boundaries inside of which, aggressive violence is not permitted.  That rule stems from the assumed fact that individuals are the ultimate owners of their bodies, which is probably the most fundamental definition one can give of libertarianism.  More on that [here](http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/ethics.asp) [[audio version]](http://mises.org/media.aspx?action=category&amp;ID=95) if you have some time (Nobody will be able to tell you you don't understand what libertarianism is about ever again if you actually go through that book.)  It does not prescribe any particular societal or governmental arrangement.  It just requires those that exist to be voluntary.","1293843267"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;&gt;the choice is either killing myself by starvation or killing someone else, then it stops being unethical to kill the other person.

I think this is a very twisted moral compass to have. The ethical thing to do is to wait for the other person to die of starvation, then you eat him. Either that or you can form an agreement, maybe a duel of some sorts where the winner gets to eat the other person. That way no personal rights are encroached upon.

&gt;unnecessary cruelty

I don't think necessity is a good rule to have either. If someone needs to kill to survive, suddenly that's ok in your mind? So what really is *wrong* here? If its actually purely evil to do so, then you should have the balls to say that humans in places that need meat to survive should die off because its immoral to survive in that manner (or at the very least have the guts to say what they are doing is wrong and don't give a fuck about the kind of resistance you'd get from saying that). I think its hand-waving to say its ok in one instance, and not ok when you ""don't have to do it."" Then there was really nothing wrong with it to begin with.

It's possible that the paramedics, police and others involved with the accident didn't even recognize Freeman until much later.  You might think that's unlikely, what with him being the most famous person from Mississippi and having a recognizable face, but let me tell you a quick story...  
  

This girl I knew was in a serious car crash a few years ago.  A nurse on his way home from work was stuck in the standstill traffic on the highway and could see there was a serious accident up ahead.  He got out to offer assistance.  This was mere minutes after the accident; paramedics weren't yet on the scene.  The nurse helped pull the girl from the wreckage.  Her body was mangled, glass and blood everywhere, and she wasn't breathing.  He cleared her airways, performed CPR and got her breathing again.  He saved her life.  
  
It wasn't until later that he realized the victim was his sister.  
  
She made a full recovery following years of physical therapy.

Life isn't like a movie... and sex isn't that big of a deal. You put your dick in a hole. If you're terrible, who gives a shit... just fucking do it already.

Also, sex isn't like porn most of the time, hardly ever, and girls don't expect a foot long dong if that's what you're worried about.

To top it off, I see such terrible advice on here about women that I definitely wouldn't advise anyone come here for that sort of advice. It's mostly people repeating things they've heard from other people that don't know what they're talking about.

Avoid the color gray. It makes you look boring. Bright colors and that nice purple shirt make you more approachable and more attractive. I'm not sure about other guys, but I'm personally not a fan of black hair with the blonde streaks. I personally think it would look better more natural.

"rant","t5_2qn2b","I'd argue that science education is one of, if not the single most, important subject in school. And none of the standardized tests that I'm aware of can properly test for scientific literacy. They usually just go for scientific discoveries, which is a totally different subject. 

However, I'm not quite sure what my point in that is. High school students in the US are hardly coming out with any real ability to read science journals. Though among the countries whose populations I'm familiar enough with to get a general idea of their understanding of science, we're pretty much on equal footing there. Science seems to be a subject that for whatever reason is considered something people won't be able to really understand until they're into university level classes.

"ILiveIn","t5_2r4v8","Well, I wish I could tell you how wrong you are but it is true that finding a job in France (and anywhere in the EU for that matter) as an outsider is tough. 
Just like in the United States, actual citizens have right of way when it comes to picking a candidate for a job. The reasons for that are obvious: where foreigners need to adapt to cultural differences, locals are already ""ready to go"". In addition to that, foreigners often have higher salary requirements and hiring them means that the company will have to fill a ton of paperwork.

In my opinion, your best shot at finding a job here is to get transferred from an US branch of a company to a French subsidiary/succursal. This indeed means that you would be working for a large company, which is not necessarily easy especially considering that US companies tend to find Ireland a lot more attractive for branchs. France's high tax rate on companies make it a somewhat undesirable place to do business as a foreign company.
And of course, there is the fact that no matter how hard you study and practice, your knowledge of French will always be weaker than that of a French-born worker.

The few Americans working here in Lyon (or in other places) transferred here from management positions in the United States or Canada. A few years ago, my dad and his associates sold their company to a very large US firm (medical field) and some of the firm's execs started working here in Lyon as liaison agents or simply local execs.

As far as I'm concerned, I'm still a student but I was interning at an US company in France last summer and I found myself in a company that was shifting over from French workplace management to US-like workplace management (you guessed it... My dad's company) and I must say, the latter is a lot more rigid and nonsensical than the former.

Overall, I believe that working in an European environment as an American would do you much good and be a very enriching experience. Not to mention how much it would add to your work experience when you go back to the United States.

I'm sorry I can't be of more help but I'm still a student. As for life in France, I would be extremely glad to tell you whatever you want to know over emails or private Reddit messages. Seriously. Contact me.","1293843377"

I wrote my own case management system nearly 17 years ago, and it still works perfectly. I built all of the computers in my home and office. I use Linux because Microsoft products are not secure enough for serious legal work. Also, I like that my computers boot in 30 seconds and are use able right away. It's damn handy to be able to work while all of the software updates quickly, etc. My computers are also much faster than the same machines using Microsoft products. I have one dual boot (XP/Ubuntu) that my daughterts (age 4) play with. So, I'm able to run the CLEs as needed.

I agree there is not a big demand for non-MS solutions. But how could there be, when MS makes sure that non-MS solutions don't work? That's why I'd like to offer my State Bar an easy fix for Linux users.

"books","t5_2qh4i","**eBook Pros**

* We long ago ran out of space for our books in our tiny home. Boxes of books are stashed everywhere there was an empty space and now there are no more spaces. This is not an issue with our digital ""library"". 
* Ultra-convenient: I want to read a book. I buy it. I'm reading it. I didn't even have time to take a sip of coffee. Contrast this with having to get up and go to the book shop and hoping they have what I want or ordering from the Internet and waiting for the UPS guy. It's a comparions of hours or days to just a couple of minutes. This is a huge win if you're like me and hate to leave the house. Or want to get that new book while at work or something. 
* Related to that: I have 95 books on my Kindle in the ""Need To Read"" collection. Most of these are Gutenberg books, but some of them are current books that Amazon had for free at some point or another. I don't have to plan ahead to make sure I have another book with me when I finish the one I'm reading. All 100 of these are already with me. 
* Full-text search. If you like sprinkling conversations and blog posts with quotes that ""I remember reading this somewhere..."", this is a great feature. 
* With paper books, I just don't get to read if I'm tired (or pay the consequences of a massive headache). With my Kindle, I just up the font-size until it's comfortable.
* My Kindle syncs its location with my phone. I never do not have the book I'm reading. I'm reading tons more as a result. 

**eBook Cons** 

* DRM: I thought a long time about this. I don't like DRM. But, at least for now, I don't usually read most books more than once. As it is, I can't FIND most of my paper books (they're in a box. somewhere.), so DRM doesn't seem so bad. Anyway, I'm aware that I may lose all of my digital books one day when Amazon goes out of business. I've done the math for this risk vs. the benefits above and I think it works out for me. 
* Lending: This is strongly related to DRM. If I want to lend someone a book, I can't (and the new ""lending"" thing that Amazon just turned on is crap). In this case, I'm okay with just buying a copy of the book and gifting it to my friend. But this does suck. 
* Price: Some Kindle books cost more than a new hardback. Some cost less. Some are given away from free. Overall, I probably pay a little more for my eBooks than I do for paper books. Clearly, I'm not unwilling to pay that higher price, so this isn't a huge deal. If it ever becomes a huge deal...well, paper books aren't going away for a while yet. When they do, I suspect it will only be as a consequence of the market figuring out the price along with the other problems.
* My partner has a copy of Good Omens signed by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. That's never going to happen with my Kindle copy.  

So, there are tradeoffs. Just like there are tradeoffs for *not* going with eBooks (you have to carry around a big dead tree with you just to read? You have to go to a store to buy one? Gross.). 

Everyone places different values on those tradeoffs and comes to different conclusions regarding this new way of reading. I came down on the side of eBooks. But I can certainly understand people going the other way.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Because I don't want to totally break the flow of the page, and as I've said here a few times, I'm making an expansion-melee-mod that adds things I just think would make the game more fun, while trying to keep balance. When I'm done it, I hope to get it balanced up through some testing and host a tournament. Some of the major, non-unit-stat changes include...

* 2 new units for Terran (A ground based Spellcaster with no weapon, and a more durable variant of the SCVs produced from OCs and PFs.)

* 3 new units for Zerg (A T1 scouting unit that can jump up and down cliffs, and has a melee attack that can only hit air. (It jumps) A Lurker that morphs from Roaches and serves a more similar function to the SC1 Reaver than the Lurker. It can shoot spines at units one at a time, at many different enemies and do huge damage but requires an upgrade for it to be able to attack up/down cliffs, and a T3 unit that is essentially a controllable Disruption Web that is active while its attacking.)

* 1 new unit for toss (An AA unit with a very very slow move speed, but a devastating attack against armored opponents. Think killing BCs the way Corsairs killed Mutalisks)

* A few additional Neutral Resources - Controllable small Psionic Nodes that function like Xel'Naga towers and allow Protoss to warp in unit while controlling them. Foundations which allow Terran buildings to be erected faster at certain spots, and Tunnels which facilitate rapid Zerg transit like old Nydus Canals, but preplaced.

And a whole crap load of other things. It ""depowers"" a lot of cheeses, without affecting the original role of the units, and makes amazing late game comebacks more feasible (Such as a Zerg on 3 base being able to win against a 2 base Terran with mass Thors.)","1293843470"

Republicans realize they can get away with candidates that would normally be too extreme. The base elects a mess, and the mess wins in a very divided election, possibly with credible third-party candidates in the mix. (Obama vs. Bloomberg vs. Palin, for example, is scary.

""...the Gospel of Mark is a deliberate and conscious anti-epic, an inversion of the Greek ""Bible"" of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, which in a sense ""updates"" and Judaizes the outdated heroic values presented by Homer, in the figure of a new hero, Jesus. 

Who knew, for instance, that Odysseus was also a carpenter? The companions are another general link with the Odyssey. MacDonald points out how Mark is the harshest evangelist in his treatment of the disciples, while the others sometimes go out of their way to omit or alter this disparagement when they borrow from Mark. Why were the disciples such embarrassing nitwits, ""greedy, cowardly, potentially treacherous, and above all foolish"" (p. 20)? As history, it is hardly credible. As a play on Homer, it makes perfect sense: for the companions of Odysseus were exactly like this. Homer cleverly employed the ineptitudes of the crew to highlight the virtues of Odysseus, making him appear even more the hero, enhancing his ""wisdom, courage, and self-control"" (p. 23). MacDonald briefly explores five other general similarities between the two ""entourages"" in chapter 3, including the fact that in the one story we have sailors, while in the other, fishermen-who do a lot of going about in boats, even though the vast majority of Judaea is dry land.""

Essentially, the leading theory is that our universe is but one of many gazillions that came spontaneously into being thanks to the existence of 13-dimensional space and the law of gravity. Yes, that sounds a bit far-fetched but it has better mathematical/physical support than an omnipotent super-being. As others have pointed out, if you posit a universe creator, that brings up the question of where the creator came from. Some smart alecks say the creator was eternal; to which we answer that the universe and/or the conditions from which it arose could well also have been eternal. There are interesting discussions about whether time has a beginning, or whether it has significance outside of a universe.","1293843506"

That isn't to say other charges wouldn't apply if they use force to continue or if they don't stop when a jury recognises they aught to have.

A comparisson is trespass (and rape is trespass to body) tha if I invite you to the middle of my land, the invitation also takes into account the leaving of the land should I say, uninvite you. There are places in the world were trespass can equate to consent to be shot, dead, so you see the problem jurisprudence may have changing these rules.

The second is pretty much the state of affairs. It's not ideal, it's best application of law. We all exist and in existing we consent to lifes risks, we're accountable and responsible for our choices and were our choices lead us, for better or worst.

The difference exists in law but it's principle. Jurisprudence is theory upon which consistant law is made and applied. Change jurisprudence and you cna change the outcome of every case history ever had. 

When two peole agree the either a, set in stone what they're agreeing to or b, accept some risk that they have agreed to two different things. Who's fault is it if they find that b is true. It is both thier faults equally. And in it being both thier faults who's actually been injured by anyone but themselves? Neither.

This is true only if good faith exists, which is mostly assumed, but if bad faith is proven. If in case b above it can be proven to the standard required by law that one had bad faith then it's back to trespass and further battery.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Hi There! I applaud your AMA. Please forgive the ignorance, fear and chauvinism here. I am 27 and had my first child in 2009, homebirth, attended by 2 midwives. I had 14 hour labor mostly back labor. After she was born I got to feed her and we took our first bath together, she never left my sight. I just found out I am pregnant again, and I am trying to figure out my options as our financial / insurance situation is different. 
Although the pain is intense, I highly recommend homebirth, AS LONG AS you are low risk and have a very experienced midwife with a close back-up OB. (my midwife spent 10 years in Labor and Delivery as an RN before she became a CNM). If you go to a hospital the Dr.'s will usually pressure you into induction if your labor is not going according to their timetable. My labor was 14 hours, they probably would not have allowed that. Many of the drugs that they use to induce labor (cytoctec, etc) are not approved for the purpose and can result in issues that will eventually lead to a C-section, which have a myriad or problems and complications. My position on it is this- it is your decision, but as women our bodies ARE made for child-birth, NO ONES body is made to be cut open. ","1293843521"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It's a tough position to be put in. People expect a certain loudness; a certain ""thump"" from the kick drum, a certain ""sizzle"" to the guitars, etc., all part of the experience. It's supposed to be impressive and have a certain energy you don't get from prerecorded music.

And as a sound tech if you try to mix quieter, very quickly you will be told by the bar manager, tour manager, band's merch guy or guitar tech, and the audience members themselves to turn it up.

*Personally* I disagree with a lot of techs, and I try to cut out a lot of the most irritating frequencies, perhaps more harshly than they would.

Like, for instance, I almost never use overheads (the mics that are put on the cymbals on the drum kit) because at the size venues I usually work (around 600 person capacity) you just don't need any more of that damn cymbal wash in the mix. You already get enough of it off of the vocal mics and just off the stage itself.

Frequencies around 3.15 k, 4 k, and 5 k are some of the most irritating frequencies to the human ear, and is where a lot of that unintelligible ""shhhhhh"" sound at a loud show comes from, so I also try to dial those back a bit (depending on the PA, room, etc., of course), sometimes severely.

TLDR: I think you can still make a show loud without accentuating the more irritating frequencies as much as a lot of techs do.","1293843525"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Sir. I ask you, imagine this:

Imagine that you're a teenager, who loves watching G.I. Joe, and dreams:

""I want to be a soldier one day, and free the innocent from the clutches of the evil communist monsters.""

So you put your mind to becoming a U.S. soldier, because you believe in stuff like freedom and happiness.

In between, you hear about things like, ""Iran tortures American hostages"", or ""China bloodily prevents protests in Tiananmen Square"", or ""Another journalist killed for what they say"" or ""Soviet Russia: Now with even more censorship!""

""No way!"" You imagine. ""We must spread the awesomeness of Freedom and happiness to those sad, enslaved people! It's my duty as an American!""

Quickly being enlisted as a private, you parade through your hometown, giving speeches about ""I believe that not only Americans, but people around the world should enjoy the awesomeness of freedom!"" People cheer! ""Fight for freedom! Fight for justice!"" your girlfriend yells.

Sent off to Afghanistan, you go with a small feeling of revenge, but also with empathy for those who are so blinded that they attack the freedom that American intervention gives them. Everything, your sanity and your friends was lost, but you remain firm with the thought that: 

""This is what must be done for the oppressed, and for the free at home.""

But things change. While defending a girl's school from the evil Taliban, the mission changes.

""Get your ass over to Iraq! We've got new orders.""

Iraq? We didn't even find Bin Laden yet. Why are we leaving?

""They've got WMD, they torture citizens, they kill thousands without reason! Let's go, private!""

So you wave sadly to the educated, veiled girls, knowing that they will be at risk of a terrorist attack the instant soldiers leave. Your commander sees you sadly waving to them.

""Don't worry, private. They're sending a new unit in soon."" Your stress then lowers.

You say quietly to yourself, ""Everyone deserves freedom. Iraqis deserve it, too.""

Later in Iraq, you helped kick Saddam's sorry ass back to the hell it came from. In the streets of Baghdad, people cheer for you, as they have achieved freedom. A little girl cheers for you.

Years pass, and things are still bad in Iraq. New rules of engagement come in, forcing soldiers to shoot anyone who looks at them funny. Strangely, the same people who cheered for America are now horrified by the sight of a U.S. soldier. 

""Must be those damn terrorists and their propaganda.""

A new order comes in. ""There's a terrorist hidden in a house about two miles from here! Shoot anything that moves.""

POW! Gunfire noises. ""Terrorists! Freedom-haters! You shall die by my hand!""

""Hey! Private! We got the terrorist!""

A camera? Some pieces of paper? ""But there weren't any weapons!"" You think.

Back at the base, a headline grabs your eyes. ""10 girls killed during attack on school."" No. It can't be.

Why'd I come here? Why did I have to abandon them?

Another job comes up. It's in intelligence. And they want you to handle it.

""It's not for the faint of heart, private. Prove to me that you can handle it.""

""Don't worry, I've seen worse. As long as it helps me defend freedom, and happiness from those evil, hostage killing terrorists.""

It's a room. Filled with secrets. You know what secrets lie in there. Horrible ones, about other countries who hate freedom, and threaten journalists. But as long as America knows these horrors, those evil countries will never be safe again.

The crimes against humanity seep into your mind, about endless torture, people laughing when they blow up a busful of children, lies, cover-ups, and corruption everywhere.

The worst part? It was the culprit. A name you never imagined that would be associated with such war crimes.

America.

The person you apprehended? He was tortured to make him confess. The girl's school? Accidental drone strike. 15,000 more casualties than reported. Horrible atrocities kept away from the public's eyes. All of this fits Soviet Russia better, not the freedom-fighting America.

You come out, submit your report, and go out to lunch.

""Hey. Jim.""

""Whut?""

""If you saw that someone was causing horrible atrocities, what would you do?""

""Hey. Aren't you an American? Have you forgotten what we came here for? We came here to blow the shit out of those who hate freedom and who enslave and torture people.""

""What if it had been kept secret? What would you do?""

""Why do you even have to think about that? Remember the Nazis? If someone had spoken out against the Holocaust, and got people to stop it, there WOULD BE NO HOLOCAUST. But no, those little underlings just let it be, and us Americans had to save Europe. If I were at Nuremberg, and I tried one of those faggots, I would call for the goddamn death penalty.""

""Well, what if America did war crimes? Would you report them?""

""What the hell, man? Why would we do war crimes? We punish war criminals. We punish evil terrorists. You're telling me we would do war crimes?""

""Uh... yeah! I was just speaking rhetorically.""

What would you do in this situation? Horrible atrocities were kept secret. We tortured people even when there wasn't a shred of evidence that they were terrorists. We killed journalists without reason, and laughed after shooting anti-tank rounds at them.

If one of our founding fathers caught wind that America was doing this, they would have called for revolution. They would have leaked those secrets so the culprits could be put to justice. If our reputation was at stake, it wasn't because the atrocities were leaked. It was because we conducted them, and allowed them to happen. They would have condemned those who saw these secret atrocities, and didn't report them, as the real traitors. And now you're telling me that he should be hanged?

Or you can think of it like this. You're a German Nazi in an investigative sector. Propoganda keeps telling you that everyone else is the evil enslavers. But at the same time, you find out that Nazis raped Polish women, burned Jews, and suppressed freedoms. If you leaked those secrets, at least some people would be outraged, and would have stopped all this in a revolt. But you would gain serious enemies, and might even be killed. So what would you do? Live a cushy life while people died? Or gone out and did the right thing?","1293843558"

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","&gt; Kerry fully supported the war in his time in the Senate.

Not according to Wikipedia:

&gt; After the invasion of Iraq, when no weapons of mass destruction  were found, Kerry strongly criticized Bush, contending that he had misled the country: ""When the President of the United States looks at you and tells you something, there should be some trust.""[75]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry

I think Kerry probably felt just as betrayed as everyone else by Dubya by the time 2004 rolled around.

&gt; I'd hope any human would find them repugnant, but the Bush administration didn't and it seems the Obama administration doesn't, either.

Because, as I said, unlike Dubya or Obama, Kerry had seen war firsthand - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry#Military_service_.281966.E2.80.931970.29

&gt; Between that and the GOP smear campaign that portrayed him as a rich kid sitting on the sidelines during the war in Vietnam and exploiting his opposition for political gain he didn't really have an edge over Bush on that topic.

The biggest pros are the efficiency, low smell, no noise at all, ease of use, no coughing, and high portability. Lifetime warranty is nice too, though I haven't had to use that yet.

The cons as I see them: the included 2 batteries aren't enough, so plan on getting more NiMH batteries if you don't have some laying around, especially if you plan to share a smoke with more than one other person. Also the charger they give you isn't a quick charger, so you might want to invest in a good quality powerex/maha rapid charger if you plan to use it a lot. A good charger is expensive, but it'll make your batteries last longer each charge and have a longer lifespan as well, so it's worth it in the long run.

I'd definitely buy it again, it's well worth the $100. Don't get me wrong, I still use my glass pieces as well, but the MFLB is king for portability, efficiency, and stealth use.

This is dangerously too fast. If it were legal and they knew that they would be punished if they caused a wreck they would drive very slow. Most people who drive drunk drive less than two miles. It would be very easy to avoid these drivers. Assholes that drive too fast and recklessly with alcohol in them will drive like that regardless of legality. The largest drop in drunk driving deaths was in the '90's when M.A.D. had a massive tv campaign. Remember the commercials with the home videos?

"wow","t5_2qio8","Really want to thank Reddit especially - I've been around here for a long time, and didn't really start posting on here until our guild started wanting to help others out.  The feedback and support has been excellent, and has gotten a lot of my guildmates, that would normally not have written anything, in to researching and wanting to help out as well.

A lot of them have also been exposed to Reddit (which just isn't as big in Australia...yet!) and they have stuck around to join the wider community.  We end up with quite a few articles on our site, and I try and just bring the ones I find best over.

Anyways, I really just wanted to take the time out and say a huge thank you to everyone that has come to our site in the last year.  It has been a great time, and we're excited to keep putting things out!","1293843599"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The point of all manners is to make the other person feel comfortable, though, and if you're not doing that then you're doing it wrong. I don't have an axe to grind against men, at least not all men, just the men who do it wrong. The women too, though. And I do try and take each situation on its own merit and give most people the benefit of the doubt.

So what just happened was that I read your comment and felt all ruffled because of the assumptions you've made about me, but I guess that's how I made you feel. I'm sorry for having done that- for placing you, random internet dude I've never met, in the role of the pandering jerk. In my defense, though, I was just off commenting on the ""biggest asshole"" thread thing, and was in a foul mindset (seriously, Jake is a giant asshole, and he hides a lot of it through false chivalry that eventually comes out as ""you're female know your place."")

I think that your heart is in the right place. I have a friend, F, who walks me home at night because he cares about me and opens doors and other things. I have a colleague, B, who lifts heavy weights for me and looks for cars before lets me go first in the driveway.

Both men think they're chivalrous, and by the letter of the law (not the spirit) they are. The difference is that F does that because he cares about *me* as a person and wants me to be safe. He doesn't mind when I hold doors for him in turn or send him off with my spare umbrella in the rain. B, however, gets ruffled when I grab the big bag even  though I've passed all the fitness/lifting tests and he makes it clear that he doesn't feel comfortable with an all-female crew going out because he's not sure we'd get the physical side of the job done. That is frustrating and demeaning.

Yes, I have had ""this must be so hard for you as a woman in a male dominated area"" thrown at me to make it clear that I didn't belong. It sucks because there's almost no defense against it, just a sad feeling of alienation.

I hope that when you're being nice, you're being nice because you care about the other human being. I hope you can understand why some women in male-dominated fields have a knee-jerk reaction to ""ladies first"" type things, and I hope that they're not too nasty when they bristle so that you're not discouraged and you can show them that genuine concern still exists. 

Also, I like that you threw down the ""madam."" That was classy as hell.

&gt;When your 90 year old grandma buys you a lame sweater for your birthday, would you actually look her in the eye and say

That's NOT what happened here though.

First of all, this is not looking Grandma in the eye...

What happened was if you went to whoever organized your family gift exchange and said ""hey, just so you know for future reference...I had a problem with the gift I got"".


Second of all, what we are not talking about is a lame sweater....what we are talking about is if Grandma got senile and crapped in a box and gave it to you.

In that case you would say ""Hey, just so you know...grandma is losing her mind...maybe you should double check her gifts next year"".

&gt;the point of gifts that it's the thought that counts

YES! AND THATS THE PROBLEM. NO THOUGHT OR EFFORT WAS PUT INTO IT AT ALL....

It's not like the secret santa tried real hard and now OP is spitting on their effort. They threw some dirty candy into an old and dirty bag! They put zero thought or effort into it (at least it certainly SEEMS so).

"funny","t5_2qh33","You obviously have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. People go to Chachos to get drunk, Taco Cabana because it's cheap, and Alamo Cafe because they're stupid. Alamo cafe does have excellent queso and tortillas but their mexican food sucks. I remember ordering enchiladas there years ago and they were topped with Wolfe brand chili.

&gt; it borrows its culture from Mexico and combines it with ""TEXAS YEAHHH!!!!"". As a result you get a slew of restaurants that play off these qualities, hence texmex.

TexMex is not Mexican food, it's its own thing. I'm sure there are places outside of San Antonio that have good Mexican/TexMex food but I doubt they have the wide variety we do here.

If you want enchiladas, go to either [Thousand Oaks Cafe](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/39/432403/restaurant/Northeast-Side/Thousand-Oaks-Cafe-San-Antonio) or any of the [Blanco Cafes](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/39/430248/restaurant/Uptown/Blanco-Cafe-San-Antonio). [La Cocinita](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/39/1565847/restaurant/North-Central/La-Cocinita-Cafe-2-San-Antonio) is excellent as well. If you want tacos, go to [Cristan's](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/39/430586/restaurant/Midtown/Cristans-Tacos-San-Antonio) or the [Little Taco Factory](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/39/431394/restaurant/Midtown/Little-Taco-Factory-Mexican-San-Antonio). Theses are just a couple from the top of my head but I can take you to hole-in-the-wall places no bigger than your average kitchen with little old ladies making tortillas. You'll take back anything bad you ever said about San Antonio's food. Yes it's  a boring city, but if you think you know anything about our cuisine from eating at Alamo Cafe and Chacho's, you don't.

If I were an administrator I probably would not support this program after what I have experienced. Ask me a couple years ago and I would have said ""Heck yes! I'm all for putting more tech in classrooms.""

But really, it's turned out to be a huge expense with very little return on investment. We basically just got an expensive word processor and internet browser to take home. Many of the teachers haven't been properly trained, so we're not even using them to their full advantage. 

Personally I do really appreciate it for writing essays and staying organized because I'm normally a very messy and disorganized person when dealing with IRL folders and papers. It's nice not having to carry around heavy textbooks, too. But has my education really benefited from having a crippled MacBook to carry around? Not really. On top of that it makes it difficult for teachers to grade, so it actually hurts us.

**tl;dr** - I was very excited when they announced this program last year, but due to poor execution and unenthusiastic teacher/student support I would not recommend it to other schools. 

It was a great learning experience, though. Now I have anecdotal evidence to argue a case for or against similar programs. ","1293843648"

First of all it was at the Allstate Arena, not in.  The concert was in the parking lot.  Black top.  On 4th of July.  It was so hot it made you nauseous.  There was an occasional  slight breeze and concessions.  The concession stand was upwind of the stage.  If you bought a $5 watered down beer, it was hard to find garbage cans so you'd just drop the cup and it would blow to the stage.  By dark it was knee deep in cups.

Allstate arena is on the landing path for O'hare.  The stage was right in the way, every 5 minutes (at least once per song) a jet would come screaming  over the band and drowned out the sound.

Eventually they started letting people into the arena because too many kids were getting sick.  By late afternoon it was just a bunch of kids hanging out in the lobby and bands playing to a dozen people at a time.  The musicians were pissed, the fans were pissed.  It was not good at all and we left before anyone worth listening to made it to the stage.","1293843654"

I wouldn't rule out that privatizing security would create a giant shitty industry because it can't get much shittier than the TSA.

Cheaper, faster, and more efficient security measures would be a great selling point for airports and airlines, and there's no reason they wouldn't want to attract more people by saying ""Come to our airport because our security systems finds weapons five times faster than all the others.

See, artists and labels don't get a cut from radio play. This was done for a *reason*. Well, arguably two reasons. First, if the labels could set the royalty rates they could essentially control all of music radio. Second, because radio play *sells music*.

The other problem is the horrible lack of creativity and rent-seeking that this move represents. An excellent sign of an industry in decline.","1293843703"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Be prepared to get a lot of hate on this game. I recently got this game and am in Chapter 11 and so far loving it. I have played all the Final Fantasy's and after being so disappointed with FF12 I didn't have high hopes for FF13. So far I must say this is the best FF game i've played since FF10.

Sure the story and characters aren't perfect but Square's execution of it was very different compared to what we've seen in the past. They basically throw us in the middle of the story with these characters and I love the way we slowly find out who each of them are as they come to terms with what happened to them. I also love the feeling of urgency they place on you with being constantly chased it almost makes you feel a bit paranoid.

Yes the linear aspects can be a bit disheartening but it does open up in Chapter 11. FF10 was very linear until you got the Airship, heck all of the Final Fantasy's are linear in certain aspects.

I see a lot of people complain about the characters being angsty or melodramatic but I think with what happened to each of them it seems normal to me. I mean, wouldn't you be a bit angsty if you were in their shoes?

Also, I see a lot of people complain about the battle system and how it's just nothing but auto battle. Which that can be true what Final Fantasy isn't just auto battle?

FF7: You could beat the entire game by just pressing Attack and not having to use magic (minus Emerald and Ruby WEAPON)

FF8: Once you learn Mad Rush you could beat the entire game by just using that

FF9: Same as 7, just use Attack

FF10: Same as 7

FF12: Hell once you set up your gambits in a certain way you could let the AI do all the fighting for you.

I think the only challenging FF's we got were FF4 and FF5 TBH.

I think in the end FF13 is not perfect nor is it the ""best"" Final Fantasy but it is damn fun in my opinion. I was very hesitant to even buy this after seeing all the criticisms but now that I'm more than halfway done with the main storyline I honestly don't see why everyone thought it was bad. Sure the game is not perfect and I do have some gripes with it but it's honestly one of the better RPG's I have played.","1293843710"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","People are all pissy over XIII because it is a very linear game, rather then give you a hole bunch of side quests that you can run around and accomplish to obtain new and exciting gear/skills, it focuses on following the main story arc and only opening up at the very end.

VII is a great traditional JRPG and is the game that pretty much all JRPGs are compared to (in the west at least). However most people have fairly rose tinted glasses when looking back on it as it is it was the first RPG that most people experienced. Still worth checking out.

VIII had a terrible battle/character development system, however it was still a solid game

IX is the best of the series imo. Class based characters, good leveling system and just a fantastic game a must play in the Final Fantasy line.

X pretty good also fairly linear (which kind of confuses me as to why everyone seems to love this game but hate XIII for its 'linearness'). Sphere grid is similar to the Crystarium as a means of leveling characters.

X-2 good combat and game play, only play this if you love X.

XII another one that you will hear a lot of hate towards. I thought it was fantastic, good story, good leveling, fun battle I would recommend checking it out.

I haven't had the chance to finish any of the other games in the series so I can't really comment on them. ","1293843714"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Of course my anecdotal accounts don't count as scientific research, but here they are for what their worth:

I am an absolute caffeine fiend now, at age 29, but I wasn't when I was 9 or 10 years-old, when my migraines (with visual aura) started.  I hated the taste of coffee and tea, and my mother was a soft-drink Nazi.  She didn't keep any in the house, and we rarely went out to eat.  So, in my case, I doubt caffeine had anything to do with causing my migraines, as I rarely consumed any.

I suppose caffeine could now be a trigger, though.  If I've learned anything during my experience with migraines, it's that the answer to the question, ""Could X trigger a migraine?"" is always ""Yes.""

At various points in my life, I've tried to stop caffeine cold turkey.  At other points in my life, I've decided ""Fuck it!  I'll drink two liters of Mt. Dew every day!""  Sometimes when I've gone cold turkey, I've gotten a migraine.  Sometimes when I've resumed regular caffeine consumption, I've gotten a migraine.  Most other times, I haven't gotten a migraine in those situations.  So, from my own personal experience, caffeine consumption or withdrawal  and migraine don't seem very closely correlated with each other.  Of course, I didn't record the data and run detailed statistical analyses on it, so there could be a correlation that's not obvious to me.

Regarding migraine and the brain:  My visual auras happen in both my eyes, in *exactly* the same way, at *exactly* the same time.  The visual aura is *exactly* the same in both eyes.  That being the case, in my specific situation, I kinda doubt that the problem is happening in my retinas, and I am more willing to believe that the problem is occurring somewhere further back, like the visual cortex of the brain.

Also, I've gotten other types of migraine auras.  I've had one-sided numbness traveling from my toes all the way up to my face, over a period of about 30 minutes.  I've also gotten a migraine aura that just left me fucking confused for about 30 minutes or so.  It was pretty trippy and scary... I could still function, mostly, but I just all the sudden started having all these memories flood back into my consciousness, against my will almost.  When that subsided, I went to dial my girlfriend at the time to tell her about it, but I couldn't remember her phone number.  It took about 10 tries before I got it right, and this was a number I'd dialed several times a day for the last couple years.  With all of those auras, after the aura symptoms had passed, I got the familiar and very distinct migraine pain/malaise right afterward.  I'm not sure what could cause symptoms like these other something going on in the brain.

As for Cortical Spreading Depression, I'd be willing to learn more about whether it is the cause of migraine or rather just an earlier symptom in the symptom cascade of migraine, caused by something happening earlier on.  Regardless of whether it is the root cause of migraine or not, I think it's a step in the right direction.  I still get annoyed when a doctor tells me my migraines are happening because the blood vessels in my head are expanding and contracting, mainly because I knew about CSD over 5 years ago, and if I know about it, they should too.","1293843740"

It seems to me that this whole thing has gone completely out of control. That post up there? That was a joke. I put that there when the submission had about 150 upvotes and maybe 78 downvotes, and never expected it to hit frontpage. Now it has 2.326 up and 1645 down, both of which will probably be higher by the time you read this.

It seems to me that the submitter completely underestimated just how many people see r/gaming at any given point in time. Poor bastard is probably celebrating the New Year right now, and has no idea how many copies of Minecraft he inadvertently promised to buy. At this point I'm just waiting for him to get back so I can see his reaction; otherwise, this submission would've been gone long ago.

1)  It's the perfect law, as teenagers can't respond with their vote.

2)  Teenagers are being used as the scapegoat while the clubs are the real problem.

3)   Large groups of teenagers, who are relatively poor, tend to scare away the higher paying citizens, such as my parents who travel to downtown for dinner, then visit the craft shops, etc.

4)  It's also a little bit of a race issue.  I'm sure the council members don't mind my friends from Irving Park hanging around after dinner at Mellow Mushroom...but those kids at Inferno for Teen Night?  They don't belong downtown!

I find it funny that one sign of a vibrant city is the number of people milling around.  It boggles the mind that the City, who just a few years ago, would be begging for anyone to venture downtown, now is comfortable with kicking people out.","1293843821"

The origins of the first ratlines are connected to various developments in Vatican-Argentine relations before and during World War II.[2] As early as 1942, Monsignor Luigi Maglione contacted Ambassador Llobet, inquiring as to the ""willingness of the government of the Argentine Republic to apply its immigration law generously, in order to encourage at the opportune moment European Catholic immigrants to seek the necessary land and capital in our country"".[3] Afterwards, a German priest, Anton Weber, the head of the Rome-based Society of Saint Raphael, traveled to Portugal, continuing to Argentina, to lay the groundwork for future Catholic immigration.[3] According to historian Michael Phayer, ""this was the innocent origin of what would become the Vatican ratline"".[3]

Spain, not Rome, was the ""first center of ratline activity that facilitated the escape of Nazi fascists"", although the exodus itself was planned within the Vatican.[4] Charles Lescat, a French Catholic member of Action Française (an organization suppressed by Pius XI and rehabilitated by Pius XII), and Pierre Daye, a Belgian with contacts in the Spanish government, were among the primary organizers.[5] Lescat and Daye were the first able to flee Europe, with the help of French cardinal Eugene Tisserant and Argentine cardinal Antonio Caggiano.[5]

By 1946, there were probably hundreds of war criminals in Spain, and thousands of former Nazis and fascists.[6] According to US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Vatican cooperation in turning over asylum-seekers was ""negligible"".[6] According to Phayer, Pius XII ""preferred to see fascist war criminals on board ships sailing to the New World rather than seeing them rotting in POW camps in zonal Germany"".[7] Unlike the Vatican emigration operation in Italy, centered on Vatican City, the ratlines of Spain, although ""fostered by the Vatican"" were relatively independent of the hierarchy of the Vatican Emigration Bureau.[8]

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;it would be ignorant of this universe-judge to make life in such a way that it evolves to survive by methods it would later deem ""unethical.""

You're extracting the wrong point out. Following that logic, nothing should be unethical because nothing unethical should be possible. I also don't think a discussion of ethics needs to make a call out to divine intervention, ethics can and should be seen as something that exists in our heads.

&gt;Should one feel just as guilty killing an animal in that manner as they would if they directly chopped a turkey's head off?

No, because like I was saying above, you're killing the turkey out of choice, the bug on your windshield is an accident. After that the choice is to either make whatever radical changes in your lifestyle needed to stop doing **X** or just settle for not intentionally doing it, and taking more seriously accidents involving animals with a better developed central nervous system than an insect.

&gt;Because if you want to tell me its a consistent and universal law then you should feel equally guilty

That doesn't really follow because I can still say they're both wrong without assigning the same value of wrong to them. I can consider  torturing a deer to death worse than getting involved in a hit and run. If I did, I don't think you would claim that either I take the intentional gleeful killing of an animal with some guy's broken shoulder and leg.

You can also reverse that logic, if you don't care if an animal is killed, then shouldn't you care if a human gets killed, it's all the same. Your answer would probably be similar: that you don't care about the animal as much as you care about a person.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Your reasoning is solid, for the most part.

But there's a bit of technical trivia that sort of short-circuits your idea. This isn't the sort of thing most people know, so don't feel all weird if it's new to you. It's one of those little intricacies of theoretical physics that rarely makes it into the newspaper.

For every mathematical formulation in physics — at least, every one I'm aware of — it's possible to rearrange the relevant equations so that dimensioned physical constants, like the gravitational constant and, yes, the speed of light — vanish. One really trivial example, when you're working in relativity, is to choose your units such that the speed of light is numerically equal to one: you pick the light-year as your unit of distance, and the year as your unit of time, or whatever. When you rewrite the equations this way, dimensioned constants disappear … and yet physics still works.

What this means is that the laws of physics do not depend on *the numerical values* of the various physical constants. Every physical constant is, in essence, merely a constant of proportionality; it's a number you use to convert from one system of units to another. In general relativity, the speed of light is the constant of proportionality that physicists use to convert between length units in space and length units in time — meters and seconds, light-years and years, or whatever. You can change the numerical value of the speed of light in a given system of units all you want, but the equations don't change.

The bottom line is that you cannot explain away an observation in this universe by postulating a different numerical value for a physical constant. The mathematical models that have been developed to describe the universe work in such a way that the numerical values of the various constants are irrelevant; if the model works with one set of values, it will also work with other sets of values.

So before you even begin contemplating a model like the one you thought about, you can know right off the bat that you won't get anywhere by *doing nothing* but changing the numbers. That won't get you answers that are any different from the ones you're already confronted with. If the answers you're getting are consistent with reality, then changing the physical constants won't break the theory. And if the answers aren't consistent with reality, changing the constants won't help.

If we assume that special relativity works — and, let's just be honest with each other here, *it does,* then cosmological observations of distant galaxies cannot be explained merely by postulating a change in the physical constants. You have to have some other explanation for what's going on. That's what ΛCDM does.","1293843865"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Agreed. Body-weight &amp; add a chin-up bar, and you're in a great spot. Also, from personal experience, at that age you can be tempted to over-do it, and possibly hurt yourself with free-weights. It's much harder to hurt yourself w/ body-weight exercises.

If you wanted to suppliment it, you might want to consider getting a resistance band set (cheaper than dembells). When I was in HS I got a cheap used bench at a garage sale, I bet you could pick one up for pretty cheap, but honestly, as *troublesome* says, body-weight exercises are a great way to go, and cost you basically nothing. Also, it's probably good to get used to a routine that's portable. You're going to be moving a lot (most likely) in the next ten years (back and forth from college, apartments, etc) it's good to get into a routine that you can do anywhere.

Very true, non-solipsists generally have a big problem with it, even had a relationship break up over my personal philosophy.  I guess there's a latent portion of my subconscious that still tries desperately to hold on to the physical world that I've incorrectly been made to believe my whole life.

I reply to you to get direct feedback, this is how we are communicating.  If I only think about the response to myself I may miss what my subconscious has to say.  It's like a dream, everything there is just yourself, and you interact with those 'beings' by communicating in the same way they are choosing to talk to you.  So if one comes up to me and wants to talk about that tree I saw today and I sit down and write a letter in return, my dream won't know how to interpret that and I will get no responses.  Same thing for why I communicate with others, it fills in pieces little by little.

Why do anything?  That's an odd question, I have the entire universe (careful to read that correctly) at my disposal, I can do anything I want, and I can learn about myself in the process.  My goals are to walk the Appalachian Trail and see the absolute beauty my mind can create, travel the States (then later the world) and meet the bits of my subconscious that can teach me about the location, can provide me comfort and friendship.

relax man. you're fine. sometimes it's hard to get the communications right. sometimes calls get missed and all that. just relax and set a date next time you get to talk to her. you can even laugh off the bad luck you've had in getting a plan together. if she's anything wroth dating she won't be so uptight as to be all pissy over a bit of bad luck in scheduling. 

remember, the best thing you can do is relax and let things flow. it's much better to take the mistakes and problems as they come and be cool about it then to freak out and seem all stressed, anxious, and like someone who NEEDS control of a situation. and it doesn't need to happen over break. it can happen on a weekend. you've waited 2.5 years. another week or two won't shoot you down in flames.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","wattage is a meaningless number. You are shooting for no less then 2000 lumens per square foot. the 24 watt 6500k bulbs have around 1500-1800 lumens. You have 22.5 square foot in your grow area. To get to the minimum lumens you need to hang around 30 CLFS. You realize that only the top 3 inches of your plants are even getting any usable light. This will probably be ok for veg, if you try to flower it without a HPS or modified SCROG/SOG/BOG grow in this setup you will be disappoint.  Dont spend another dime on anything till you get the right lights. PH testers and all that shit means nothing if your not growing under the right types of lights. Its a weed and can grow just about anywhere under even the worst set of conditions. The one thing that it must have is a lood lighting solution. You need one. 
Also- the #1 rule of growing is to tell noone. Posting on reddit/r/trees pictures of your rig and plants is not the best idea.  
Get that C02 generator out of your grow space. Its okay for aquariums but you are risking a mold/bacterial infection. C02 injection will actually retard the growth of your plants if you dont have enough light for them to photosynthesize and resperate.    ","1293843933"

He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:

""Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck."" If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you.""

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Well I actually made the comparison long before this website-- like a month after Fight Club came out.  I've long been of the opinion that Ferris Bueller is not the main character of Ferris Bueller's day off.

The ""main characters"" of a story are generally the ones who go through some kind of journey of personal development or something.  Ferris is static.  He learns nothing, faces no significant obstacles, and at the end he hasn't changed from the person he was at the beginning.

In my opinion, the main characters of the story are Cameron, Jeanie, and Mr. Rooney.  Ferris is just the force of nature that pushes them all toward personal development.  He's the antagonist.

So in the comparison with Fight Club, notice that when Ferris plays sick and gets rid of his parents, Cameron is already home sick.  Not really sick, but he's faking for different reasons.  He's trapped in a life which is materially perfect-- i.e. lots of great ""stuff""-- but which is soulless and empty.  Ferris is an alter ego he invents the same way Jack invents Tyler.  Similarly, they both reach a crisis point due to the threat of some kind of physical destruction (the Ferrari vs. the credit card buildings), which is resolved after a pseudo-suicide attempt (almost drowning in the pool vs. shooting himself) followed by the complete destruction of what the protagonist was trying to save.

I really enjoyed that as well.

So, I would advise trying out some old ones, as I found VII fun, but didn't find it fun enough to finish it. But give future FF games a try, as a lot of games are fun when you play them at the right time, but might not hold your attention if you try going back to them.","1293843962"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","It seems reasonable that when someone maintains a caloric deficit while still eating a high-carb diet, that the body, flush with insulin, will still store a large part of these calories as fat. Even when the person starts an exercise program, it seems that the body will regulate the amount of energy the person expends either by increasing appetite to that more calories are consumed, or inducing lethargia during exercise or before or after so that less calories are actually burned than expected.

I would say that the calorie deficit hypothesis persists precisely because of people like the ""Twinkie Diet"" guy. His body, probably due to inherited genetic factors, regulates insulin very well.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;women are attracted to successful, rich, in a word alpha men. 

Eh, some are. I've been on the extremes more often than the middle ground in terms of income and influence. I've had time with a fairly rich and glamorous life, time as independently wealthy and able to just gadabout while still getting tons of cash, and been homeless. During the first, my wife cheated on me. During the second, I dated a fair amount just because I had more time, but nothing really went anywhere amazing. I certainly never found myself a magnet once women discovered my financial and socioeconomic status. While I didn't really date when I was homeless, because what's the point. I couldn't exactly invite people back to the storage closet I broke into most nights. But it was really on the verge of getting out of it, when I had a bit of cash, but was still homeless even though I didn't look the role, that I seemed to get the most attention from women. I suppose it could be argued that I gave off an ""alpha vibe"" just from the fact that my position in life then by necesity was based around being able to talk my way out of shitty situations, and not paying much attention to anyone elses ideas of law or authority. But meh, pretty similar situation when I was independently wealthy too. And I was far less interesting to women when I had that cash.

I think a lot of that idea just comes from guys who've dated a lot of douchy bitches who look at dating as a second source of income. And just don't realize the sucky person they're with sucks, and look for someone of a higher moral caliber. ","1293844005"

I missed it for years until I remembered all the hassle that comes after that initial attraction and that my man is the best man I've ever known.  Giving him up for the hotness of someone new would be immature and ridiculous.  But I had to decide that, it wasn't just something I knew.

As to the secret to staying attracted...the initial attraction will and did fade for me.  But as I got older I noticed that I was attracted to different things about him.  Things like his maturity, his intelligence, his care for me.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;The only argument with the catholic church is that they did nothing

That seems a somewhat strange argument though. For instance see [here](http://www.religioustolerance.org/vat_hol12.htm):

&gt;The Vatican hid 477 Jews during the war. Another 4,238 were hidden in church monasteries and convents.

or [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_Nazi_Germany):
&gt;The Israeli historian Pinchas Lapide interviewed war survivors and concluded that Pius XII ""was instrumental in saving at least 700,000, but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands"". Some historians dispute this estimate[56] while others consider Pinchas Lapide's work to be ""the definitive work by a Jewish scholar"" on the holocaust.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;But one doesn't, because a system which represents a majority of users of a good does not account for the minority which must also use it. Keep your self-representatives to yourself, and I'll keep a system by which the value of currency is subject to the interests of all people using it, i.e, market value.

Fair point, but currently the Federal Reserve has a monopoly, so it's not market driven at all. Although they want you to believe that by calling it free market capitalism. In my opinion that term is reserved for a truly market driven money creation system that is not based on a monopoly by law.

&gt;This and the creation of currency by the federal government are mutually exclusive.

No, because the government can just be another party in the free banking system. They'd be competing for market share as much as the commercial bank on the corner. The point is that there would be a choice for people and where they have their money created and to whom they pay interest in case the money is issued as debt.

Right now all money has its root at the Federal Reserve. Sure commercial banks can apply fractional reserve banking, but not like in a free banking system. The current system is paralyzing and surpressing to the free market forces you are referring to, partly due to the laws that protect the monopoly of the Federal Reserve.","1293844071"

The US experimented in the 1990s. (The ATACMS is just a special missile fired out of the same MLRS launcher)

&gt; 12 February 95 The final NATACMS Block IA prototype missile test was an ""at sea"" firing from an M270 launcher on the deck of the USS Mount Vernon  positioned off the coast of San Diego, California. The shot flew 75 nautical miles for a direct hit on the target.

-----------------------------------

I have personally been in interested in this failed experiment for a while. Although this was to be permanently mounted to a destroyer, rather than artillery strapped to a merchant vessel.

http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_61-52_MONARC.htm

--------------------------------------

&gt; The US had lots of boats like these at Normandy. Howitzers on gator ships.

I seem to remember that as well, but most of what I found now is improvised rocket ships and small guns permanently mounted to the deck. The type of arrangement shown in this photo of land equipment, including cannons/howitzers, being temporarily strapped to a non-military grade ship is hard to find. It makes sense as the recoil from the guns must be quite the obstacle, making rockets far more preferable.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Because popularity is not always defined as how many people love it as how many people don't find it offensive (and not even primarily in the lyrical content). The less offensive it is, the larger number of public places it can be played (bars, movie trailers/soundtracks, shopping malls, etc) and worm its way into the public consciousness. Most people (and I'm sure if you hunted long enough you could even find someone you know who is like this) don't really love any music. They just want music that they can ignore in the background while remaining fairly pleasant to listen to. 

As much as I love The Flaming Lips, look what song of theirs EXPLODED into the mainstream, their most simple, pleasant, non-offensive song. I'm sure most people have a favorite band where they say to themselves ""I can't believe THAT'S the song everyone loves.""","1293844099"

But that's just me. All those reasons kept me away from literature for years, until I got a netbook and discovered the joys of reading.

As for the front page domination and UD: good point. I just don't see New Defs as the killer app. Perhaps accompanied by the twitter feed?

As for the alphabet, I think maybe my resistance was magnified by the letters in blogs - kinda created a Tuftean ""vibration"" of vertical lines in the white space. That other kid's redesign took that away nicely. But again, maybe softened by using some jquery animation - a slider that embiggens the chosen letter? (Or maybe not.)

You can write notes, doodles, drawings, phones numbers etc in books in margins easily with any pen or pencil, not likely quite the same for the average ebookreader.

No, unless you are going to argue that there is a bubble in *all* commodities, because everything has been going up the past year by 20% or more.

And it should be remembered that gold had basically been unaffected by inflation for 25 years prior to picking up in the 2000's.

At low level, you just wanted to sneak around more, stay closer to towns and roads, etc. Only with a nice set of spells or armor or whatever did you get brave enough to explore to the deepest parts of dungeons and tombs, the most distant ruins farthest from nearby towns, etc. A high sneak skill or an invisibility potion or something like that goes a long way when you have weak direct offenses/defenses.   
  
One large Dwemer ruin very near Balmora was incredibly extensive and went very deep. In it were some pretty challenging enemies. Interestingly, you were sent there for a quest in one of the earliest parts of the main story. Although the place was huge and deep and filled with danger, though, the item you needed to retrieve for the quest was actually in a room very near the front entrance. So, you got it and left, finished your quest thing and moved to the next part of the story -- but you still had this tremendous place to explore, perhaps when you felt confident enough to do it.

I had been screwing around with VMWare so I can use Ubuntu to log into anything that I needed using a browser session as I still game and need all my work related stuff on Windows. That's been working fine for the past bit, but after doing some recent windows updates it appears the session issue I was having is fixed o.0
I've been logged into a few websites now for 5-10minutes and have yet to be booted as before it would boot me in less then 60 seconds. The most notable Windows Update I did recently was the .NET Framework 4 Client profile, however there were a few prior to this, so it's possible it was one of those.
TL;DR - It appears the issue stemmed from Windows itself and was patched in a recent update. I hope I'm not jumping the gun here as I've only given it

First thing is the cage is huge and the ring is small (you don't have to chase your opponent down in the ring - easier to cut him off).

Another thing is it's easier to use the clinch to push up against the cage and take guys down.  (Greco guys like Couture would be screwed if they fought in the ring.)

Also the japanese will forgive a fighter for losing if he is in an entertaining fight, so the most important thing is to be in an entertaining fight - in the US winning is the most important thing in the end.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I had a relationship with a guy that my family didn't like. I told myself that we loved each other so much, and that my family had treated me badly, so their opinions didn't matter, and that he was worth losing them over if it came to that. I thought it was romantic that it was him and me versus the world; that we were kind of dark and tragic and that was romantic, right? 

My family didn't like the way he treated me. To be honest, I didn't really like the way he treated me, either, but he was the only one who would have me, and he *wanted* me; wanted to marry me, even! 

I stayed with him for three years. I lost weight, even though I had none to lose in the first place. Towards the end, we were having screaming matches in between our long periods of simmering silence. I was completely off my head, cutting myself and crying, hurting myself because I couldn't bring myself to hurt him, and at some point I realized that I was just hanging around waiting for him to hit me. I wanted him to; I felt I deserved it, because he had brought me down so much that I thought it would really be only right, or at least inevitable, that one day he would finally lose it and just really fuck my shit up. He was a big motherfucker to start with, and he had started studying martial arts, and he had a temper, so I knew it was going to be bad when it happened. I knew that if I stayed, I was going to die, either because he snapped my neck over breakfast one day, or because I finally got so depressed I cut my own throat. 

I thought my heart would break when I left him. I thought I was betraying him, and I was a bad person for doing it, and that I still loved him, and cared about him, and worried about him.

But I fucking did it. Because I was choosing between life and death. 

So are you. You're choosing to die. Right now. It might not happen today, or tomorrow, or next year. But his pattern of behavior, and yours, will continue, and they'll feed each other, and you'll forgive it and forgive it, and you'll get high together and forget about it. And one day your family will get a call from someone, and the person on the other end will be telling them that you're dead. The guy you're choosing to be with is an addict and an abuser, and your family is throwing you out so they don't have to watch the two of you conspire to kill you slowly; it hurts them too much to watch. 

For what it's worth, here's the end of my story: I got my life back. I got my shit together, and learned how to be happy with just me, and how to have a healthy relationship. Counseling helped *so* goddamn much with that. I decided to look for a partner on *my* terms, not just the first asshole who would have me, and whaddaya know, I found one, a great guy who communicated openly and honestly with me, didn't display abusive tendencies, and helped me heal a great deal. I've repaired relationships with my family, and they all recently turned up, happy and smiling, to celebrate my marriage to a man who is a great partner. A handful of years ago, I was planning to die; now I'm making plans for a whole new life. 

Get the fuck away from this guy. Get counseling and get your shit together. If you have no insurance, go to your local health department and ask about mental health services. That's how I got a year of weekly counseling for fucking free. Trust me; you'll thank yourself later.","1293844239"

"PS3","t5_2qhhw","I think this market will take off when the US finally gets a larger broadband network. Since games are getting larger and larger with higher quality systems/media devices, some of my PC games are up to 14-17GB each. If I had FioS I could load that on the fly over a network instead of using up my harddrive space. Having games stream to you over the internet will work when we can get speeds close to 10MBps, or they could use other methods like having major parts of the game installed on the HDD, then have music streamed to you, or textures for the next level stream to you while you play. 

Right now blu-ray is the best way to go. Large amounts of data storage and it can reach the full market potential. Plus if we see streaming games expect to see even tighter DRM. Another downside is not being able to resell the game. If you go to amazon.com they sill DLC codes but they're just strictly MSRP. I don't want to pay extra for the convenience.

I just pre-order the big games on amazon and get launch-day delivery, but I don't rent games either so streaming may work for a different outlet other than purchasing. ","1293844289"

I typically priceline it, but I've recently had success with:

* booking it via work.  This is good for holiday rentals where a rental car company may jack up the consumer price but leaves the corporate rate alone.  My company allows you to book car rentals with a corporate discount.  I google for coupon codes to stack on top of this.

* doing a flight+hotel+car package.  I don't know why I've never looked at these before, but you can get some very competitive rates when you do this.","1293844291"

"reddit.com","t5_6","My friends and I call each other lots of names that would be unacceptable from strangers. Here's a question for you: Why do you feel the need to say ""nigger""? What good does it do you to refer to black people that way? Does it empower you? Does it make you feel better about getting laid off?

I don't know why you're racist. It could be bad parenting or that you resent black people because you were negatively impacted by affirmative action. Calling Obama a ""half nig"" is not a joke. I can only speculate why you feel the need to introduce racism into casual conversation online but it's not okay. You seem like you might be relatively smart since you're an atheist (which isn't to say the religious are stupid, but unless you're being rebellious you've put thought into things) and you're into libertarianism (I don't agree with it, but it's logic taken to an extreme so I can somewhat respect it) so why be such a knucklehead about racism? 

You're just a kid raising a kid and you have a huge opportunity to break the cycle and teach him to judge people individually and not go around calling black people ""niggers"". You talk a lot of trash about being willing to beat people up in real life over non-violent actions; is that the kind of example you want to set for your son? You're 23 and you're right at the beginning where it's easiest to change things and be a good person and a good dad. Good luck Hubbell. ","1293844291"

Reddit has a pretty broad libertarian/liberal streak, and I'm pretty sure a lot of the Christians in this subreddit fall in that category. For seconds, we're not going for ""superiority"". We don't want to lord our behavior over others, or at least we shouldn't, because ultimately any good we do we do because God is helping us.

It's also worth noting that what Christians do is, unfortunately, not always what's presented in the Bible.

Also, Christianity isn't really about a set of black and white rules. We're given some absolutes (such as ""thou shalt not have any other gods before me"") and some fuzzy things (eating meat sacrificed to idols is okay, but only if your conscience lets you be okay with it, and only if it's not going to put a brother into temptation). It's ultimately a matter of what glorifies God, a which tends to overlap with helping people in a loving way.","1293844323"

Version 1.4.4

This installer will install the entire mod compilation, enable gamedata folder support in the fsgame.ltx file, and make various changes in your user.ltx file. In short, it automates the core installation steps you would normally have to do manually. However, it will reset your in-game settings to their default values.

Compatibility:

    * Retail DVD versions of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl game with 1.0005 (or 1.0006) patch
    * Direct2Drive digital copy with Digital Distribution 1.0005 patch
    * Steam (launch &amp; exit the game at least once, check for version 1.0005 and install the mod, start a new game after)

Make sure to patch the game before installing a mod, otherwise you will see a black screen on startup. To check if your game is patched, see lower left corner of the main menu screen, it should say ver. 1.0005 (or 1.0006). If nothing is there, that means it's version 1.000. If you have a Steam version, wait for it to get updated�automatically.

A special note for Vista/Windows 7 users:
It is recommended to run this installer as Administrator (right click the installer file and select 'Run as Administrator'). This is suggested due to issues with UAC and Rights Management, making it possible to have an incomplete installation and/or leftovers after uninstalling. Running this installer as Administrator avoids such issues.
It's also recommened to temporary disable Microsoft Security Essentials (this can be done under Settings inside the program), as it will try to unpack and scan the installer resulting in unresponsive system.
Starting a new game is required!

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","From the article, I don't think that women really want to return to 1950's gender roles. It looks like they were asked whether they would like to stay home and take care of their children while their husbands worked. Most would not. 40% would. I don't think that it is unreasonable for some women, particularly those who do not have great career prospects, or who are married to men in stressful professional fields, to want their husbands to make enough money that they have the option to be housewives and mothers as their full-time job and to have enough flexibility that they can support the career of the person in the relationship who has the higher earning potential. These are important jobs that someone has to do. I can see not wanting to work to pay someone to do what you could do yourself if you did not have to work to make enough to pay them. This has nothing to do with re-establishing rigid gender roles. This is an important distinction. I say this as a woman who has always worked, and who has been the primary earner in my household for over ten years while my husband has been a SAHD homeschooling our children.","1293844364"

With their setup currently where you have to wait for moderators to read comments, if they get topics that give over 1000 replies, their mods are working overtime. 

All it is is them controlling the debate which is censorship. If the private sites want to do that, it's their choice. With CBC being publicly paid for, the fact that they even have censors pre-post is fairly alarming.

Develop a plan. Be aware as well that you may begin to feel more tempted to escape your circumstances through alcohol or whatever. You'll need to be as sober-minded as possible.

Long story short, you don't know what might have happened with this person.  Perhaps you would have ended up like me, alone in a family of 4... or perhaps you would have ended up like her, married to a narcissistic douchebag who was able to cure his sociopathic tendencies long enough to get some poor chick to breed with him.

There have been many crippling heartbreaks in mylife, but I have survived them all, and I will survive this one too.

I hope you take strength from this.  Perhaps this was exactly the wrong thing to say, and if so, I apologize... but I am being honest with you when I think that honesty about the messiness of affairs of the heart will matter.

But this year they have been in the news so they have become an issue for people to complain about yet do nothing.

The thing about that kind of music is, there isn't much of a market for it in the music biz, so most of the recordings out there are done by ethnomusicologists for archives etc.

[Alan Lomax](http://www.youtube.com/user/AlanLomaxArchive) did a phenomenal job of collecting recordings of various types of American Folk music; take a look through those YouTube videos, you'll hopefully find something along the lines of what you're looking for; if not, I bet the ""related"" sidebar could lead you in the right direction.

It'll probably be hard to find specifically somber music like that which you've described, because it's all categorized the same usually.

Not only is the above true, but many of you need to understand the following.  

Not only will women not raise a finger to save their man's life...  As conquered land after conquered land has proven, not only will women not lift a finger to save their men, or avenge their men, they do not even attempt to preserve their culture.  Women will also very willingly ""love"" the conquerers, have their children and adopt a new culture and not just forget their old culture but betray it.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I can't believe you were downvoted for that. My own inability to see past the weight of people when it comes to considering them attractive has been something that's actually caused me a fair amount of annoyance. I've come to accept that I can't get past it, but at the same time I also put it among some pretty serious character decencies on my part. If anyone asked me if I was superficial about who I'm attracted to I'd have to agree that I am if I was being honest. 

At the same time though, I do realize it's a bit of a dickish trait. Is it totally natural, probably. But so's raping any woman I find attractive and killing any guy who stands in my way. Part of being civilized is learning to take over those kinds of base instincts and working with them to create something more thoughtful. And, that's something I've totally failed at. I've dated some women who were overweight because I found their personality attractive, but just couldn't get past the weight. 

I think the danger comes in when you don't recognize it though. Being controlled by something like that is one thing. But being controlled 'and' oblivious to it is another. ","1293844499"

**This is kind of gross. Those with weak stomachs get the fuck away from this post now.**

A Leper walks into a bar, sits down, orders his drink. Bartender looks at him kinda funny, but doesn't say anything. The leper sighs and thinks to himself ""great, I can't even go to a crummy dive like this without assholes staring at me."" No one else says a word to him while he finishes his drink. 

The leper orders another and, yet again, the bartender gives him a kind of grossed-out look -worse this time- without saying anything. 

By this point, the leper is starting to consider leaving, but he goes ahead and finishes his drink. He figures he'll give it one more round before leaving. He orders his drink, and this time when the bartender gives him yet another disgusted look, the leper just can't hold it in any longer and says:

""Look sir, I understand that people are sometimes a bit put-off by my condition. If it's a problem, I can take my business elsewhere, but if not: I'd appreciate it if you would stop giving me looks of disgust whenever I try to order a drink.""

I can. I'd use that unlimited executive power the POTUS seems to have gained in the past 10 years to actually do good for the nation rather than say, giving myself the permissions to murder anyone anywhere anytime without any cause or evidence.

* Universal single payer health care?  Executive order!
* Same sex marriage?  Executive order!
* End the war on drugs? Executive order!
* Campaign finance and lobbying reform?  Executive order!
* Immediate and rapid plan to fix our crumbling infrastructure? Executive order!

That is just a small sample of what I would wrought with unlimited executive power.  Not snooping and spying on every american, or having the right to murder them.

Then again, I imagine if any president tried half this shit, specifically the campaign and lobbying restrictions or rather any attempt to detach corporate control from the government, would result in a JFK-esque assassination by the CIA.","1293844577"

Geek people (no offense) don't know how to deal with people and how to deal with marketing and what to include and what not to include on an application. Apple says with reason that the most important stuff they learnt was what NOT to put on a software. This is what Linux has to learn. 

I use linux in all my servers but I hate Linux on the desktop and the reason is this: you install the system. If everything works (1% of time) you are lucky. If something fails (a camera not working, the fucking audio not working, etc.) you are doomed. Then you have 1 trillion pages to look at a solution. 99% of the solutions don't work. They you find a page of someone offering the source code that you need to compile to make a driver. One has to be sent to the firing squad for offering a source code that has to be compiled. This is the first thing to ban. Offer the binary shit or don't offer anything. They don't realize that people arriving on a page after googling it, arrived there searching ""driver for stuff X"". Arriving at the page and finding a source code that has to be compiled to become a driver is stupid.

I have a Ubuntu machine with skype. Every time I try to use skype there, I have no audio, or no video, or both. Every try to fix that requires installing a load of shit and uninstalling another load. Then you have to change config files editing the crap and after 3 hours doing this, skype is still not working. This is why I hate Linux for desktop and I have to say that I have plenty of experience with Linux servers since 1996.... now imagine John Doe trying to use this shit and giving up after 3 seconds.","1293844579"
"reddit.com","t5_6","There's a social custom of reading someones post before replying.

OP is not ""telling someone they didn't like their gift"". OP was providing feedback to a gift exchange program in good faith.

So right there, your point is completely invalid because OP was talking to a third-party.

Furthermore, that custom mostly applies to when people actually put in an EFFORT or THOUGHT.

If I spent a lot of time painting a picture, but it turned out like shit....you could appreciate that I tried.

If 5 minutes before I saw you I realized I forgot to get you a gift, and so I wiped my ass on some paper and gave it to you as a ""picture"" you would rightly be offended that I would a) insult your intelligence by trying to pass of a clearly half-assed ""gift"" b) abuse the gift exchange program by basically sending nothing.

It's not like the SS made a modest but well thought out care package for OP...they threw some dirty candy in an old bag.

OP was within their rights to bring it up for the benefit of the program so that they know to possibly come up with a plan for future instances...etc etc.

No they don't, and no they are not.

1.

This is exactly how I ended arguments with my sister when I was 12 and she was 7. The results when arguing with an adult are pretty much identical. It's ridiculously childish, but it's the only satisfaction you're likely to get out of this kind of argument.

2. No. And neither should you. If they're the sort that believes you're close-minded before the argument, nothing you can say is likely to change their minds.

3. No. And it sounds like you already know what you're doing wrong.

4. If they're annoying you that much, you've got two choices: stop being around them so often or stop caring so much.

If you did then you would not have trouble staying sexually attracted to him or aroused by him. I've been married for over 13 years and my wife is the hottest woman in the world to me. She's no supermodel in societies eyes either just mine.

The fact that after 5 years you still only have a boyfriend says everything. You aren't married which means your relationship has been in flatline for awhile now. Without getting married and deciding to be together forever your life together will never grow into something bigger. 

Best advice I can give you is to ask yourself one question. ""do I want to spend the rest of my life with this man?"" If the answer isn't an immediate yes with a smile on your face, then the answer is NO! And you are wasting your time being with him any further. Bite the bullet and move on before you piss away 20 years of your life being polite. He feels the same way wether he admits it or not.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;I think this is a very twisted moral compass to have. The ethical thing to do is to wait for the other person to die of starvation, then you eat him.

Point there was just that ethics is based off choice set, if all choices are ""unethical"" for the same reason, then none of them are unethical. In other words: if you don't have a choice you're not culpable because it couldn't be any other way. Probably a bad scenario set up.

&gt;If someone needs to kill to survive, suddenly that's ok in your mind? 

Yeah, because then it's a choice between being _A_ dying and being _B_ dying, it's the same result, so the ethical dilemma goes away. I wouldn't blame someone who had to eat human flesh for doing so anymore than I would blame a quadriplegic for not running into a burning building, it's just a question of what is and isn't possible, ethics doesn't even get a chance to enter into the equation. Would you tell a person that it's unethical to kill other humans so if someone is about to killing them with an ax ""It's really just your time to go."" It seems either we say you have the right to not want to die and since the worst case result of the choice is objectively the same (one person will die either way) you're exempted or we tell people to essentially follow the same few sets of rules until it eventually kills them.

&gt;then you should have the balls to say that humans in places that need meat to survive should die off because its immoral to survive in that manner

No, you just want me to say that, because then I become an unreasonable person.

&gt;Then there was really nothing wrong with it to begin with.

Of course there was something wrong with it, it's just if you're forced to do something that's not the same choice as not having to do it but doing it anyways. Going back to the ax murderer example: Killing random people carrying axes is a different choice than killing one who is currently coming at you with one.","1293844696"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Below (or above) are excellent summaries of the different categories. To answer your question about which category you would fall under I will say this: the message of Islam is very simple, i.e. believe in the oneness of God (Allah) and that Muhammed (peace be upon him) is His messenger. If you understand this then there's no language barrier to speak of. The gap arises when attempting to understand deeper issues of fiqh (jurisprudence) particularly as interpreted by the Qur'an. But this is not required in order to be Muslim. In fact, many native Arabs do not fully understand all or even most of the verses of the Qur'an. On the other hand, there are many who are not native Arab speakers and have through hard work and dedication taken it upon themselves to learn the language and learn the meaning of the Qur'an and its subtleties.

As a starting point, and if you are considering Islam, I would first come to terms with the basic tenant of Tawheed (unity of God) and the messengership and prohpethood of Muhammed (pbuh). Then, with His help, try to tackle the rest.

Arabic is my first language but my Arabic is very limited. Try these audio lessons to get acquainted with what the Qur'an has to offer:

If she is asymptomatic the chances are pretty low that you'll contract it if you use protection.  Notice I said, low, not ""no"".  Asymptomatic shedding is a proven risk factor.

You might want to avoid oral, because as bad as a genital inoculation of type 2 would be, an oral one would in my opinion be somewhat worse than genital.  If she tuns out to be ""the one"" maybe you won't care that much since most likely at one point or another you are going to be infected.

Realistically unless shes the first person you've been involved with there is a very real possibility that you've already been with someone that has it, and there is even a real possibility that you yourself carry it.

The Eucharist *is* radically inclusive, which is exactly why those who have excluded themselves from fellowship and unity with the Church should not partake of it.

&gt; Because it performs so poorly relative to more secure democracies, the status of the
U.S. as an advanced 1st world nation is marginal and may even be at risk; the World Economic
Forum recently downgraded the U.S. from its long standing first place status in global
economic competitiveness, ranking some other democracies as more competitive (WEF, 2007).
The societal and economic failings of the U.S. are all the more remarkable and difficult to
explain because no major nation has such extensive financial and physical resources with
which to overcome its internal defects. With ~5% of the world’s population the U.S. possesses
a quarter of the global financial assets and uses a similar portion of the planet’s energy
production; but this means that America is the least efficient advanced nation in terms of
converting wealth and assets into social health (Marks et al., 2006; Rosnick and Weisbrot,
2006; Sapolsky, 2005).

Labor rights and ending child labor are noble goals and all, but they are luxuries of rich nations.  All modern, industrialized societies have gone through a sweatshop labor phase, and they all grew out of it once the average laborer got rich enough that they could afford to strike, not have their kids work, etc. without risking starvation.

Leaving the beard on warrants a high five from your friends, but high fives don't get you laid.  It's up to you to prioritize.

In addition, keep in mind that growing it out isn't going to make it fuller or cover more area, it's just going to make it longer.

We have a complex system of course and change comes slowly but most often when, lets say a monetary system falls out of favor, it is changed or replaced in a response to please the electorate by improving and fixing flaws incrementally. 

I can't imagine that our current system is so unpopular and dysfunctional that most people really want revolutionary change. I spent this past election looking at data returned throughout a Congressional campaign I worked on (Democratic) and saw nothing to indicate that voters would mandate wholesale change in the way we approach monetary policy. 

Indeed most people are leery of revolutionary change and feel that even larger incremental changes like the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act caused our current ills. Indeed even with a clear mandate for change (healthcare) many people have cognitive dissonance because of a fear of the new.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","First of all, I'm glad this is being considered. I think it is important for the health and constitution of MFA. A new rule that came to mind  -""When asking for advice, be as specific as possible""

This is pretty vague, and I don't think it should be a rule, but I think general open mindedness should be **suggested**. For example, stay open to the idea that there might be some decent, cheaper items, as well as staying open to the idea that expensive items are actually worth their price. Stay open to the idea that people might actually be trying to help you when they offer criticism. Stay open to the idea that you might not be phrasing your question properly, etc. There seems to be a decent amount of entitlement among those asking for advice, and similarly some closed-mindedness in those that answer questions. Both could be cured with a little humility and open-mindedness.

Also, at the risk of extending this post into a rant; you might be that person that is not willing to buy any dress shoes cheaper than Allen Edmonds on sale. I'm one of those people. We might suggest Allen Edmonds (they're worth the money), but if we do, we should explain the virtue of expensive shoes (that being quality of leather, resolability, goodyear welt, quality of the stitching, overall elegance, and more). In this way, we remain informative and helpful without seeming stuck-up.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; My understanding is that the sheer amount of currency floating at this point far outstrips the physical availability of gold

This is one of those odd misunderstandings that keep popping up with any discussion over gold.

Anyway, in theory, the amount of gold makes no difference *if* there is no fixed exchange ratio between dollars and gold. So obviously going back to the $35/oz is wholly impossible. But I'm not aware of anyone promoting a gold standard or currency competition who is saying we should go back to that exchange rate.

Money is just there to facilitate trade beyond barter. And as long as the money is *divisible* enough to facilitate trade, the *amount* of the money makes no difference. To put it another way; if you have only an ounce of gold in a bank vault and the bank issues notes in, say, 0.00000001 ounces, the economy will work... in theory.

Increased or different atmospheric motion may mean that water is swept up from some place it used to not be or dropped on some place it used to not be, creating effects like hurricanes and floods and droughts that don't seem temperature-related at all, but that may be. So It will be mixed all about, which is why Climate Change is more accurate.

"tech","t5_2qh48","If only it were that simple! At any given moment your computer is either idle, or some component is holding things up. Which component that is depends on the code it is executing at that particular moment, so you would have to explain the details of what activities you most want to speed up.

For example, booting up or loading an app, the hard disk is the primary bottleneck. Browsing Reddit will almost certainly be limited by network latency and bandwidth.

The slowest bandwidth component being used will usually be the most noticeable, so for general usability, work down the list in this order:

internet
hard disk
RAM
CPU / video

That said, your CPU is several generations behind the curve, which also means you are limited in RAM bandwidth. I'd be more inclined to put my money aside and wait until I could afford to move to a current generation motherboard, CPU and RAM. Any CPU that uses the latest chipsets will be a significant improvement.","1293844924"

1: the big purple thing is a bowl. Food goes in at the top. :D

2: any of the chillis can be ground into powder or flakes, the red chilli is likely your best choice in most cases unless you're after a specific thai-like effect. Allspice is a specific spice, also known as pimento. If you're after *mixed* spice, then cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves (and possibly some allspice)

3: Yes, lots. 
* Sesame: on top of bread, sprinkled on salads if that's your thing, ground up into tahini, a major part of hommus...   

* Cardamom and cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, nutmeg, cassia: think buns and spiced cookies, gingerbread, fruitcake, etc  

* Peppercorns: soups, stews, etc. Or grind it and use on *anything* savoury. 

* Basil and oregano: Italian food, anything with mediterranean vegetables: tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers - or flavoury meats such as lamb. (personally, I much prefer fresh basil in all cases, but oregano dries well)

* Asafoetida: Sabotage. Mix with water, find someone you hate, and spray anywhere hard to clean, such as upholstery. 

* Cumin is big in Mexican food. 

* Coriander seeds, soups and stews, as for peppercorns.

* Star anise: southeast asian (esp. chinese) cooking. Anise + soy sauce + fresh ginger = ""that chinese food flavour""

* Paprika: anything tomato-based, anywhere you want the 'depth' of chilli without the heat - and a deep red colour. 

4: Just smell and taste them. Imagine how they'd change the flavour. If in doubt, take a spoonful of whatever you're cooking, sprinkle a tiny pinch of what you're thinking of adding, and taste. You'll learn this by trial and error. 

5: Essentials: well, it depends what kind of cooking you're into. 
* Baking: cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ground ginger. 

* Italian/mexican: Basil, oregano, paprika

* Curries: the core of all curries is cumin, coriander, chilli - the rest depends on precisely what you're making. 

* The list goes on. Tell me what you want, and I'll tell you what you need

6: As for 4. Trial and error, play it by tongue. If in doubt, read recipes and pick out common themes.  

7: I'd ditch any of the mixes. 'italian seasonings', curry powders, etc. They tend to suck, and you can not only learn more but also get the precise effect you want by using your own combinations. 

8: Burns happen, just be careful. I'd forget gloves, they're generally too thin. I use a *dry* teatowel folded into a thick pad. ","1293844933"

Do NOT pay the debt to anyone EXCEPT the internet company. ONLY the company who reported the collection to the credit reporting companies can remove it. A third party like a debt collector or companies offering to clean up your credit history for a fee cannot do anything about what is reported.


I would contact the original creditor, in this case, the internet provider. Explain what you are trying to do and see if they will work with you. You will absolutely have to get a manager involved to pull the debt back from the debt collector. This may or may not be possible.

No matter what happens, DO NOT pay the debt until you have in writing by AN AUTHORIZED person, that upon payment of the debt, the account will be reported to the credit agencies as paid in full or paid as agreed or even not reported at all.

I really have to wonder how a small (&lt;$500) debt from three years ago is stopping credit from being issued if everything else is right. Are there other chargeoffs? Bankruptcy? Late pays? This alone will cause an increased interest rate, but a tiny debt from 3+ years ago with other good credit in the mean time tells me there is more to this story.

I've done lots of credit counseling as a volunteer with local home ownership programs, so I'm pretty up on how the credit reporting agencies work.

"linux4noobs","t5_2qy7t","Not every situation for the user is going to be the same, so I'm concerned that there might not be a lot of relevant experiences from others to couch your position on. Because each company and organization is going to have different requirements and different needs, many of these considerations will have to be addressed as a totally unique situation to that specific company or organization.

I have no doubt that you've put a lot of thought into your proposal and likely have taken many other aspects of this ""switch"" into consideration. Perhaps if you could shed more light on your plans people here would be better able to provide you with suggestions to bolster your current ideas and spin this into a proposal that would be approved by your boss. Some information on the following might be helpful:

- **Licensing:** One of the most significant considerations for any organization – and especially 501(c)(3) nonprofits and other not-for-profits – is how moving from volume licensing on software (i.e. Microsoft software) will affect partnerships with hardware vendors who traditionally give substantial incentives to nonprofit organizations for bundled services. In many cases this makes [the cost of Microsoft software negligible to the organization]( https://partner.microsoft.com/US/licensing/licensingprograms/ltvolumelicensing).

- **Distro:** Which flavor has been tested (or would your small tech firm be willing to test) to be not only compatible from a hardware and security standpoint, but to also be compatible with the users? This would need to be compatible with all the stable applications the user might put to use, from Skype and messengers to proprietary drivers and software.

- **Distro Pt. 2:** What is the benefit of making the switch from software that someone just paid for, or at least licensed, on machines that may be part of a 3-year upgrade program or part of COLA? Even though you want to transition to a ""free"" solution, the cost for Windows, Office 2007/10, and everything else will have already been defined as a [sunk cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost). How will this loss compare to projections on the savings related to switching to a ""free"" solution, with or without support? Will switching to Linux affect the cost to your small tech firm's capacity to provide support and will there be additional costs to your clients for that support? How does this affect profit for all parties involved?

- **Migration:** How are you going to migrate all your users; how long is it going to take to slipstream a flavor of linux that can be approved; and what contingencies are there for unplanned downtime? What reassurances can be provided to your clients that downtime, especially for important or mission-critical systems, will be kept to a minimum? Are there spare systems that can be swapped in if an OS install goes awry or the network driver doesn't work? Who will be on-call during migration and who can answer immediate concerns raised by users about their new OS?

- **Support:** Who will be available to provide support to your customers after the migration has been completed? Does your small tech firm mainly employ Windows-related tech support and will Linux-certified people have to be hired to replace them? Can the Windows guys be brought up to speed on Linux in a reasonable amount of time to professionally address not only a new operating system, but a specific distro with explicit software requirements? Who will train them while also being available to support the clients? And what your boss will be considering most: what will be the expected duration of employment for current employees and is it worth the investment to train them for additional skill? How will additional expenditures factor into the growth of the company as a whole, while balancing the new 

- **Software:** You've already mentioned this is something of a problem, and from my experience there's no solution to proprietary medical software when it comes to ""let’s try it on an OS it wasn't designed for."" However for normal desktop users and such, what software would be used instead of closed-source/expensive licensed software? Will OpenOffice/LibreOffice be a sufficient replacement for competing products? What about specialized, but otherwise “common” software applications such as calendar and contact organizers? What software will replace current standards, or can they be run on Wine or in a VM?

___

OP, I think you have well-placed intentions, but there will likely be a lot of unanswered questions here and several difficult decisions that you specifically might not be able to influence at this juncture.

Often times changing to a new OS is not the hard part, it’s dealing with the people, the money, and productivity that produces conflict -- even when moving to a better solution.

It took a long time for my daughter to get over it as she say many signs of the affair and felt bad for not telling me.  It's a couple years later but there isn't a day that I don't think about it.  

Ironically the affair started on the same day we signed the papers on our dream home that we were going to live for the rest of our lives in.  The previous owner was selling it because his wife cheated on him only a few months after they moved in and were in the process of a divorce.","1293844979"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","1) Most atheists don't think anything of Karma in real life. Being an atheist only means that you don't believe in a god, there is no rule about Karma. Some atheists may believe in it, others will not. You may find that most atheists who embrace skepticism (a common reason to become an atheist) will not believe in Karma.

2) While this is not in the FAQ it is a question asked so often a simple google search will likely land you many good answers. When it comes down to it anyone who thinks the world looks intelligently designed does not understand how completely stupid the world is. Trust me, as someone who was an engineering major (to be far I never got my degree) I can tell you that if I had the imagined skill set of God, the world would be a much much much much much better place than it is now.","1293844980"

Justin Beiber and xfactor contestants are middle of the road pop singers designed to please the multitudes, and with not too much substance.  Hence the two categories don't really mix.  Today you have to compare the likes of Nirvana with maybe Kings of Leon or similar rock orientated bands to see if there has been a quality fall off.  Compare Justin Beiber with the likes of Donny Osmond if you want suitable 70s comparisons - you might even find that 00s chart material like Beiber and Lady Gaga is actually of higher quality than the crap some decades produced.","1293844982"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","I really think it has a lot to do with the fact that TF2 has been around for a lot longer, and that it has a lot more classes and ways to help even if you are new.

When I first started I played Engy, Medic, and Demoman. Hard to be great at these when you are new, but hard to do poorly as well. I also played pyro and just spychecked at the frontline or around engies.

Also the combat is a lot different. There isn't anybody in TF2 who fights like the guns in CoD or BC2. The closest thing is the pistol or the sniper.

I really like BC2 because of what I knew from TF2. Harder to spot when you are flanking, vehicles, the teammate spawning system. I like all of these things that TF2 doesn't have.

None of these have the depth of TF2, but TF2 didn't really start with as much depth as it has now. When it started it was basically you have a frontline of demospam and turrets, and you waited until the uber was charged and MAYBE the frontline moved. It was that OVER and OVER and OVER. Wasn't very deep.

But both games are great, CoD even has a nice arcadey feel to it, and least MW2 did, which was the only one I played.","1293844988"

The important thing to note here is that I never lived in Anderson Township. The only reason I ever went there was to visit a couple of friends. From my experience and from the testimony of everyone I've ever spoken to about Anderson, the cops there love to pull people over and go on brief power trips.

If you get cold, you can hop into a cafe. On the Metro, be sure to have your ticket time-stamped when you get on. The little machines are scattered around waist high on-board. But on the RER you have to use your ticket to get off. Point being, don't toss the RER ticket the moment you get off. For short distances within Paris itself, the bus is nice because you see the town as you go. Don't expect that many people to speak English. Grab a 20-30 year old for help.

For electric generation, you need at least 100C, the boiling point of water. I once went on a tour of a mine in Australia nearly a mile underground. It was hot, but nowhere near boiling. Maybe 33C.

Temperature in the crust increases ~25 degrees per kilometer.  So probably about 4 kilometers to the point where you could run a turbine. 

But you can use the Earth as a heat sink at much shallower depths. For this, you cycle water down to where it's a constant temperature of about 50F-55F year round. In the Summer it helps keep your building cool, in the Winter it helps keep the building warm.

I was  expecting a $4.00 an hour raise now that things have picked up. I would like more money than is being offered.

I created a new widget that lets us do herpty derp faster and cheaper. I am currently enrolled at Reddit community college and passing my derpty herp classes. 

I know the range of pay for this work is between $15 and $20 an hour in this area. I would like to continue here building on what I have learned and to contribute more.

"comics","t5_2qh0s","I have an acquaintance who is one of those pedantic audiophiles.  Several thousand dollar receiver, tube amps, insists toslink is the best; you name it he's probably used or advocated it's superiority at least once.  He can be really annoying about his sound system.

Anyway, he builds a new home theatre, with almost 10 grand worth of audio gear.  I go to see the grand unvailing, and as soon as he turns the system on I notice a high pitched squeal.  He can't hear it, but it's there.  So we start turning hardware off.  It finally goes away when we turn off his projector, a 700$ InFocus POS.  I'm thinking ""There's yer problem."" so three weeks later he calls me over to see his new projector, a 1080p LED unit that cost him almost $4k.  He gets it all set up and the noise is back.  High pitched squeal isn't coming from the projector itself, it's coming out of the speakers.  Somehow he's managed to hook his system up so that the projector is causing feedback down the line and into his amp.  With it off, no squeal, perfect audio, with it on high pitched squeal.  Everyone can hear it but him, and it makes watching anything unbearable.  After all this, it becomes obvious to all his friends that his annoying audiophile behavior was completely pointless because he suffers from hearing loss, and as a result has to watch movies in his home theatre alone.","1293845121"

OP was giving honest feedback to the SS program...in good faith.

It's not like they made a post to the main reddit saying ""OMG MY GIFT SUCKED""....they didn't even realize people could read their comment.


Remember with gifts, it's the thought that counts.

If I literally shit into a box, and give it to you...and then someone asks you ""hey did you like Hector's gift""....are you seriously trying to say you would go ""Oh yea sure, I mean even though its a bunch of literal shit and Hector gave it to me because it was the absolute minimum he could do to get a gift back, I appreciate it""

No, that only goes so far....there's a certain line where it becomes an abuse of the SS program and an insult to the giftee.

Of course not everyones gonna get an awesome present in the SS program, but they deserve to have more than 5 minutes of thought and effort put into their gift.

This observation is as superficial as they come, obviously. Leave her. Give it time. If she realises she made a mistake, and she likely will, she'll come back. By then, either you'll have the upper hand or you'll have moved on. It's not as hard as it feels sometimes to just cut your losses and move on. She sounds pretty immature.

Second Edit: Just realised, maybe she doesn't love herself enough, and doesn't feel she's worthy of your love. Reversal. Or she could just be a cunt. You'll know better than me, even if you are more biased.","1293845133"

In the middle of the night, my roommate woke up, got out of bed, lifted the lid of his laptop like a toilet seat, and proceeded to piss all over his computer. The girl in his bed woke up, pushed him over and told him to stop. His response? ""You're mean."" He stood up, finished, then sprawled on the bed so she couldn't get back in. Her and the girl in my bed spent the next hour laughing their asses off and cleaning it up, then left and went back to their room. We woke up in the morning and had no idea. I got a call from my girl that woke us up and as she's explaining the story, my roommate leans over and yells ""What the fuck? Why does my computer smell like piss?!""

- First kiss
- Passed my driving test
- Released an E.P.

- Founded a society at university (which is yet to take off, but it's on its way) 
- Gained almost 10 lb in weight, bringing me to a healthier weight (was 8 st 12 at the beginning of the year)
- Actually started volunteering/getting work experience rather than wondering where to start

There are a lot of people who have very sensitive stomachs that aren't as good at digesting meat, and so meat gives those people a stomach ache and they don't eat it.  For those people, maybe it isn't much of a choice.  But moral concerns don't take the choice away.  That'd be like saying, I didn't have a choice, I had to run into that burning building to save that little girl.  No, you didn't have to.  You chose to, and it was the right thing to do morally, but that doesn't mean that you didn't have other considerations concerning the situation.  Such as, for example, your own survival and enjoyment.  In the fire scenario, you chose to value the little girl's chance to live over your near certainty of living.

Do you know what kind of gun it was?

How big was the physical mess created by the gunshot?  Like was it all over the apartment/furniture?  Did you have to replace things?  Who cleaned it up?  

Did you approach the body after the gunshot?  Did you see any twitching?  Were his eyes still open?  Did he defecate? 

How long did you continue living in the apartment after the incident?  

I read in another response that there was a note.  Do you still have it tucked away somewhere? Or was it seized as evidence or something?

Do friends/family walk on eggshells around you during this time of year?

You mentioned you still see his daughter and her mother.  How old is the daughter and how much of this does she understand?  Do any of his family members blame you or publicly resent you?

on Summit, bottom end of the map, you can walk around the large circular structure, nobody goes around there;  OR stick it on the secret balcony - inside the main building, climb on the computers, jump to the catwalk, smash teh window, jump to that pylon thing outside.

on Cracked, go to the South-east, there's some stairs you go up  to get to the upper level of a building (not the bombed out buildings).

So CNN was it seems unjustified in labeling the under 35 results as N/A.~~

~~I'll write up the math in a few moments.~~

Edit: Sorry guys. I redid the math and got a margin of error of about 9. Looking at previous CNN polls, it seems CNN cuts out results once the margin of error gets to 9.

There are other CNN polls with similar error margins across age groups and with the 18-34 age group cut out (example in page 7 [here](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/11/17/rel16e.pdf)). It seems the 18-34 group is usually the group with the least response to these telephone surveys. (With all the cell phones around now, it's pretty easy to see why this age group might be underrepresented in telephone surveys.)

We can at least conclude that in this survey **the 18-34 age group had at least 30% approval** of Wikileaks.

[Perjury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury) is a material lie.   His perjury was a lie about a consensual relationship *instigated by the woman*.

&gt; Perjury, also known as forswearing, is the willful act of swearing a false oath or affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to a judicial proceeding.[1] That is, the witness falsely promises to tell the truth about matters which affect the outcome of the case. *For example, it is not considered perjury to lie about one's age unless age is a factor in determining the legal result, such as eligibility for old age retirement benefits.*

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","So I am splattering suicidewatch with my useless advice tonight, and I noticed your post because I have to admit, I feel the same way.

However, I am 40 and I have lived long enough to know that these feelings will actually get less intense as you get older, and that there is some pretty cool stuff around the corner, most of the time.

As for school, fuck it.  School is a test of how well you take tests.  It sounds like, from the few seconds of experience I have had with your writing that you can: 1.  Render a coherent thought.  and 2. Probably drink too much.

#1 is awesome.  It separates you from the billions of mouth breathers out there who lead unexamined lives.  You have thoughts, you have enough sense to know that they are worth sharing, you did so in this post and for that I thank you.

As for #2.  Well I am guilty of that too.  In fact, I may be just a little bit buzzed right now.  I do it because I medicate myself against the pain in my own life, and I suspect you do the same.

Finally, you say that you can't be honest with anyone.  As long as that list includes yourself, you will remain that way.  I am honest with myself to a fault and it has kept me from the abyss you find yourself drawn to.

I know that I am not necessarily a good person, that in fact, I am kind of selfish and a bit of a dick about it at times.  I also know that when push comes to shove, there is a depth to which I will not sink, a line that I will not cross, and that little bit of sand is just enough for me to look at myself with some sense of pride.  I won't bore you with details of this because it is enough that I know these things about myself.

I hope that you have opportunities to find these things about yourself.  I hope that you can look at these thoughts that you have about suicide for example and see the strength that it takes to grit your teeth and roll your eyes at that notion and just keep living.

If you want some practical advice, get an mp3 player and take walks.  Walk faster than it is comfortable to stroll, but not so fast that you are running, and really spend an hour or so with yourself pushing your feet against the pavement and feeling like you are walking away from the abyss, and towards a better future.  Plus it is exercise and you can listen to cool tunes.

My 2 cents.

If you're looking at it scientifically, you'd probably refer to something like the classification that [Dr. Nutt did recently](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/65988.php).  This study places alcohol in the top 5, while placing cannabis in 11th, LSD in 14th, and ecstasy in 18th.

My mother and grandmother, because they don't know any differently, still live by the gender roles of the 50's. They would be the type to vote for that 'return'.

 My cousins, my friends, my acquaintances, my coworkers (20's-40's) and myself are all working professionals with careers and degrees, who very much like the way things have changed/are changing.

Besides, it should be pointed out that, other than women like our grandmothers and maybe some of our mothers who experienced the conditions of women in the 50's and the ""problem-that-had-no-name"" (or women in some parts of the country who still live with the traditions), most women today have no clue what it was like to live with traditional oppressive gender roles.

And I am pretty sure the summoned creatures don't like it because I recall either the summoning spell or the entry for elementals saying that if the control aspect of the spell is dispelled the elemental is likely to send itself home or turn on the wizard who summoned it. ","1293845290"

"funny","t5_2qh33","I find the value of the ""hostile approach"" taken by the majority of brand-name atheists is mostly in putting the viewpoint out there, being controversial, and getting people talking. For a long time, religion simply wasn't discussed; doubt was always closeted.

The process that follows the shock-value of the initial ""how could he say such a thing?"" necessarily involves self-assessment. ""Do I agree with that position? Why or why not?"" It kick-starts that sort of reasoning, if only by making you so angry that you want to be able to explain how you disagree. Furthermore, someone seeking truth and struggling with doubt cannot help but confront their religious concerns when an articulate person gives voice to them. In this way, even atheists who are only out there for polemic's sake can start religious dialogues that result in real change.

Plus, I think that the social norm is to *never* question religion. In this context, even raising the subject is a hostile act-- regardless of how mild the critique. The larger-than-life antics of ""the four horsemen of the atheist apocalypse"" win conversational space for more conventional discourses on religion.","1293845292"

I'm normally away in college, and I was invited to a few parties by some close friends, but she spends half of the money she earns on my college while barely being able to afford the house we live in now, and only 8 years ago we were just fine financially.

She doesn't allow alcohol in the house, and I don't always see eye to eye with her, but since my dad passed away in the early 90's all she wants is to spend time with me before I move onto larger things in my life. I feel this is better than going out to a party with people I will see often in the spring.

I say this because a buddy of mine lost his Dad this year, and his Mom died 6 years ago. This makes him the oldest member of his family and he's still in college, with two siblings in college as well. He just wishes he could spend this night with them.

however for example:

""what do you think of these addidas white socks with my black oxford, and dress pants?""

bad answer: you look f___en like ____.  You're not cool.

good answer: white socks should not be traditionally worn with dress pants and black shoes.  It looks better when there is a smooth continuity from the pants to the shoes.  The sharp contrast is distracting, and destroys the overall image.  The safest bet is black socks which will avoid the contrast.

A solid CB to compliment Vermaelen when he makes his return. The partnership between Koscielny and Squillaci is iffy at times, and Arsenal's back 4 have conceded far too many goals this season. Though I believe Bacary Sagna is an excellent defender.

Some people will say a keeper too, but I've been satisfied with Fabianski's form. He's a sure shot stopper, but sometimes his judgment is a little off (Chelsea's goal in last week's match). That'll just come with experience though, he seems to be developing nicely.

As for Almunia, I think it'll do him well to find another team where he'll get more chances. I prefer Fabianski to Almunia, and Szczęsny seems more than capable as a backup GK. I just don't seem Almunia starting very much anymore.

Otherwise, I think the team is strong in midfield and elsewhere. We have finally got some depth in midfield with Wilshire fitting in nicely. Not to mention Nasri is on the best form of his short career so far. 

Only thing I'm concerned about is Arshavin, his form this season hasn't been particularly good. I feel that Walcott should start in his place, especially after his performance against Chelsea.","1293845395"

The Australian article lists historical flood data for various towns, and most of of the towns have had floods more severe within the past 70 years.

Don't get too emotionally attached. Car salesmen are great at picking up on this and it will be harder to get a good deal. Walk in knowing what it should actually cost (you should get able to get a 'Rex for well under MSRP).

Even if you really really want a WRX, drive a few cars that are similar. There's been more than one time I had my mind made up on what car I wanted to get, but when I actually drove a few I changed my mind. Based on what you described, also check out the MazdaSpeed3, and Volkswagen GTI at the very least. Never judge a car until you've driven it!

Consider a lightly used car. They take the biggest depreciation hit in the first two years, and there never seems to be a shortage of ~2 year old cars with under 10k miles on them.

Avoid WRXs that are modded or have signs of having been modded/driven hard. It's obvious advice, but especially true for any turbocharged car.

All the factory stereo options on the WRX suck, and it's an easy car to swap something better into. So get the base radio and swap it with aftermarket if you want nav.

I work for one of your competitors. I don't know how established your perks are, but for us we get a significant discount on basically all car brands (years ago we were able to get an Audi A4 for well below invoice, and recently we got a BMW for a little below invoice). But then again, one of my friends that works for one of your OTHER big competitors surprisingly had zero discounts on cars, so who knows. It's worth asking around in your office. Same goes for insurance; I get a hefty discount on car insurance.","1293845444"

The exception being ""girly"" things.  Just close the door while you're in there if you guys aren't at that level.

The only argument for not leaving the door open would be if it affects the sex.  Like, it may be hard for a one to be turned on if his/her SO is crapping up the bathroom with the door open and you can smell/hear it.

It really all depends on the couple.  In marriage, we leave the door open frequently, but I know of another married couple who seems to be doing just fine but they prefer to shut the door at all times when either of them is in the bathroom.

Having a 1 1/2 or 2 bathroom place can eliminate the problem altogether.","1293845445"

Take South Australia for example in comparison to the rest of the country... originally a free settler colony, with no convicts... they evolved in a different way from the white Australians in places like NSW and Victoria. The best example is that they have a different way of speaking, their pronunciation is different from the more common Eastern Australian pronunciations. 

Same can be said for Western parts of Sydney in comparison to the rest of the city. I would agree that there is an obvious divide when it comes to housing prices etc, it is cheaper to live out west. (Although Sydney is ridiculously expensive to live in, i still live in my parents house).

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First off, I don't think anything on the question of God will ever be *proved* one way or the other. We'll never prove that there isn't a God who's doing his damndest to seem like he doesn't exist, and even if incontrovertible evidence for a God surfaces, there's still no way we can prove it isn't just extremely advanced aliens simulating all of reality.

That aside, are you asking what evidence would convince a Christian to abandon belief in God? That threshold depends on the person, but skimming /r/atheism should show you plenty of evidence and arguments that convinced former Christians like myself to become atheists. Some might be convinced by logical arguments, others might be convinced by scientific evidence explaining ""miracles"", by the continued failure of God of the Gaps-style reasoning.

How might an atheist be convinced that a god exists? [This](http://www.alternet.org/belief/147424/?page=entire) is a great article explaining one atheist's standards for evidence. I haven't examined my own standards in extreme detail, but any of the evidence she lists would be pretty convincing for me.","1293845471"

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","Then you clearly don't understand the situation of some people (most lurkers?) here. They don't need help to fuck 10 girls per month instead of 4-5. They need help to fucking go out and appear attractive. Yeah, you aren't socially awkward. I'll make a wild guess and say that you weren't a geek / nerd in high school or even if you were, you didn't only socialize with other geeks. You weren't considered a loser, you didn't only talk to other guys in your situation, maybe you lost your virginity before you turned 18 and had a couple of girlfriends. For you it might appear creepy and fake.

However, there are people who didn't socialize as well as you did. They are geeks who have socialized mostly with other geeks who shared their interest. Now they are trying to find a way to socialize with other people too (or they could wait for a geeky girl... however, most geeks are familiar with probability theories, so they know that it's rather futile) in order to meet (and attract) girls. Yeah, some people go overboard (beautifully illustrated in Neil Strauss's ""The Game""), but others need this kind of help rather than the usual ""Be Yourself!"", ""Be kind to girls you like!"", ""Be a gentleman!"" bullshit they get from their older female relatives.

No one is an instant expert at everything. Some people need help at math. Some need help at foreign languages. And some need help at social interactions. I'm a mathematically minded programer who sometimes teaches math and programing to less mathematically minded or less... well, programmer-capable people. And sometimes I look at their attempts to solve a hard problem and cringe because they desperately try to apply the basic methods I've taught to them to a new problem instead of trying to invent their own methods (which I would do because I can do math and programming on a higher level). Do I think they are stupid? No. I think they have the wrong mindset for this kind of exercise and I try to change their minds in order to let them write algorithms or prove theorems themselves. However, it isn't easy. I can't just tell them the correct method because they wouldn't understand the path from their methods to mine. I have to lead them through that path.

It's the same with social interactions. You can't just tell a geek with approach anxiety and no clue about how women think to just go to the hot girl at the bar and talk to her. You have to lead them through the path. The first steps will appear fake and creepy because... well, they are fake and creepy. However, these are necessary steps to take towards being a socially capable man.","1293845560"

About how he was unable to accept criticism (especially constructive criticism) and when it came to being praised for his efforts--he could not accept that either. ""All glory goes to Allah.""

""So, let me get this straight... if you do not meet your parents' expectations--you get criticism. And when you meet expectations--all that praise goes elsewhere."" 

He didn't respond for while. So I sent him ""It's a trap. Your parents set you up to fail. Where is the motivation to do your best when you know your parents will attribute your efforts elsewhere?""

But it's a change that has never happened with dolphins. 

Honey bees have more language than dolphins do. Chimpanzees can learn human languages which dolphins cannot. So if you wish to superstitiously believe that they're secretly intelligent and are just hiding it from us, go ahead. But don't pretend that it's science.","1293845613"

Anyway, The bullies where I live are dumb. I mean it. This one time, they set up this trap for me because out of curiosity I followed them. Anyway, I suspected them being up to shit, so I walked up a different path, and saw them, ready to pounce. I decided to see how they'd act. Stamp. Stamp. They hurriedly grabbed an invisible, non existent me and threw him into the grit bucket round the corner.

.

Three seconds passed, and they opened their robotic, mindless bounty.

""Hey, he isn't there!"" One called out.

""He's up there, Get him!"" Another called after looking at me.

I ran into the nearby hotel and lost them in the maze of corridors and halls. A minute later I reached the other exit and walked home. Needless to say, they now work at the mcdonalds 10 years later. I like going there, It entertains me. Damn, bullies are dumb.

Almost all Anarchists are uncomfortable with employment relationships and the vast majority reject them outright as inherently exploitative.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Maelstrom Crystals aren't something you'll come across with little effort.  You're either raiding current content or you've got alchemy and enchanting.  More often than not, they're deliberately creating the maelstrom crystal knowing they can sell it for huge profits.  Somewhere along the line they decided that selling it for half price and reducing their profits is a good idea.

I can see someone finding a couple stacks of herbs or ore while questing, or some enchanting mats while doing dungeons, and going ""well, I don't want to spend all day at the AH, so lets list these suckers for 10-20g less,"" but creating a maelstrom crystal already requires farming the AH.

Taking my server as an example:  Yesterday, Maelstrom crystals were 1400g each.  Today they are 1300g each.  The most expensive crystal is listed at 1400g (two up by the same person).  The next most expensive is 1310g (eleven up by the same person).  Then there's six up by the same person for 1309g, then 2 for 1300g, then my two for 1299g.  

I find it hard to believe that someone came across 11 crystals by accident.  They decided to create 11, then decided to fuck a bunch of other people over by listing them nearly 100g cheaper than the previous day.","1293845704"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i"," I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but if you're looking for opinions, here's mine and I'm just being honest and hope you find it constructive and not mean-spirited:

While reading your question, I'm getting an overall feeling that you may come off a bit arrogant or even a bit aggressive. 

Do you reciprocate? What I mean by reciprocate, I guess, is do you listen to your friends? Do you engage? Do you involve? On intuition, I feel like when you talk to people, or rather *at* people, you may treat them as an audience and yourself as performer. You tell a story, you want applause. True friends don't want you to impress them. They want to join in the fun instead of being spectators. Do you joke around as a group? Can you handle some friendly jabs or does that make you defensive? 

It shouldn't bother you that this ""P"" person is getting more attention, that sounds like the jealousy thing you were talking about. I *would*, however, be worried about whether you noticed your friends actively excluding you and if so, question whether or not these people should be your friends. 

Now, your friend-base is mostly asian, you say. Though I would like to say that shouldn't affect anything and go off on a ""we're all the same on the inside!"" blah blah bullshit, this isn't an ideal world. Unless we're talking fully Americanized (or wherever you're from), born and raised asians, there are culture differences we have to consider. Your demeanour may turn them off from time to time perhaps due to clashes of their conservative/modest mindset(stereotype, I know, but from experience)  to yours which I feel might be abrasive. 

In any case, I would suggest taking a step back, not worrying too much about getting attention, and taking genuine interest in your friends instead of worrying about whether they've taken a genuine interest in you. 

Best of luck, comrade. And Happy New Year.

So in vfx, we take pictures of the set and warp those photos into an [HDRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdri) [spherical map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_mapping).

This mic works well as a hands free unit. Remember, it is a full time job being an interviewer, a full time job being a cameraman, and a full time job being the soundman... so anything that makes these jobs easier is important if you intend doing all three jobs at the same time. You MUST get something like a Zoom H1 to record the sound externally... more on this at the end.

If I were doing interviews, I would also recommend two times the following... Zoom H1 plus Sony ECM-44BMP lavaliere microphone. You strap these to the body of your interviewer and your interviewee... around the back... and run the wire under the clothing up to the collar. Use as much gaffer tape as needed to secure the plug. If you are prepared to spend a lot more on your primary recorder, I strongly recommend an Oade Brothers upgraded Marantz PMD-661. You can safely invest a lot of cash into your audio equipment, because quality audio equipment remains quality audio equipment decade after decade.

Unless you are overdubbing all the audio as narration in post, then you need to spend as much on your sound as your camera... HALF your production is sound... in fact more than half.

I contracted genital herpes type 1 (typically the oral strand) a year and a half ago and was devastated...I was terrified to have sex for a long time, or to tell anyone that I had it for fear of them judging me.  But in reality, most of the adult population has herpes already.  You can get it just from sharing a glass with someone who has a cold sore.

Unfortunately, you can also pass it along even with a condom and when not having a visible outbreak because it's spread via skin on skin contact.  No matter what, you'll be risking contracting it from her if you have sex.  But considering the fact that she takes meds that suppress the virus and she hasn't had a visible outbreak in two years, and as long as you always use a condom, the likelihood of you getting it is slim.  I just can't say there is anyway to guarantee not getting it.  It's a pretty fucking sneaky little virus.

Of course we prevent them from doing making many changes to the systems, but they do need to have some access.  Some of the software is written to be used under an admin account, so we give them just enough to run those programs.  

The systems themselves are very well managed, but we still have clients who believe they know better than us, and will make changes on their own.  You cannot remotely manage stupid.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","As a Christian I have big problems with the fundies. So it isn't just areligious people that have issues with them. The problem lies in your statement: ""I just don't get people who read Bible, claim they follow the teachings""

There is a huge gap in literacy for fundies. Most don't read the Bible. Then many who do, are literalists. They will take books of the Bible like psalms (songs) and take chunks as literal. They have no problem building doctrine on it. 

Which is like listening to the Rolling Stones Song, ""Anybody Seen My Baby"" and thinking that it is literally referring to an infant. Then making some legalisms based on the song like: ""If you can't find your baby love will make you go blind."" So saith the Stones. Amen.

So you have things like ""You formed my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother's womb"" that are being used to support pro-life points as if they were somehow law in the OT. Basically this was a song writer's way of outwardly acknowledging that God is the source of life and giving God credit for the man the songwriter has become. It does not mean ""God is inside a woman's uterus making a very complex sweater that will eventually be a baby.""

Then this combined with something that was given as a literal law for the Israelites who were wandering in the desert. ""Don't murder"".

Don't murder + God knitting = abortion is always wrong

Wait, what about Exodus 21:22-24 where the laws for a man hitting a woman and causing her to miscarry are actually stated? The actual legal statement is that the person has to pay whatever fine the husband requests that are allowed by the courts. If the woman is actually seriously hurt or killed then you can take the offender's life for her life. (or tooth for tooth) It does not treat the miscarriage as a murder unless the woman dies.

Then the fundies conveniently forget the parts of the Bible like 1 Corinthians 6:12. Where there are changes acknowledged in the Old Testament laws. 

&gt; All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

That is basically because although the character of God has not changed from the OT to the NT. What has changed was that Jesus death and resurrection fulfilled the laws: meaning that christians are not confined by rules and laws because we have ""The Holy Spirit"" coaching us on what God wants for us in a situational basis; AKA Jimminy Cricket. Then the actions that a christian takes against their own conscience are sins.

So, If a woman or couple is aborting a fetus/embryo that will most likely kill the woman, be stillborn, or is the result of rape, and etc. The decision if it is sin or not is up to God and God's will is written on a person's concience. So If the couple decides, "" We can have another baby but we cannot replace the mother's life. We don't feel guilt about aborting and trying again."" then they haven't sinned.

Basically, fundies are just big groups of people who understand small parts of the Bible to justify their stance on issues. The exact same way that the KKK justifies racism from Christian texts. It comes down to literacy. Then to make the whole thing worse, the pastors and leaders in their Churches encourage literalism and only teach from chunks of the Bible that they like. The pastors should be encouraging the congregations to understand the Bible and God's character, not just teaching [prosperity doctrine.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) I.e. If you are on God's good side he will give you money. This is how many fundie mega-churches in the USA are using people's greed to get people to Church. 

Fundamentalism has very little amounts of God and a lot of people being greedy and justifying and collaborating on their back-assward conservative opinions. Definitely not what the Bible is about.","1293845764"

IMO you've hit the nail on the head. The ""elite"" get away with murder &amp; mayhem because we're all in a constant state of fear.

I think you people missed the point of journalism: Information (in this case, limited to gaming) without being sucked into becoming the voice of a single group. That means that your writers will not have the same amount of information on any single topic that people who are truly part of the respective community have. If you're looking for that, feel free to browse fan sites and the like. Another reason for the broader orientation is that the topic might be so narrow that there isn't a market to employ a full-time writer exclusively for this topic.

It's the lipoproteins HDL and LDL that are good or bad (respectively,) and the source of dietary cholesterol does not change that balance at all. 

Omega-3 Fatty Acids can increase the HDL to LDL ratio; so specific types of fats can affect this HDL / LDL balance positively. There is no analogous type of cholesterol, and all cholesterol that you consume is bad for you when eaten in excessive quantities.","1293845815"

From your research:
The U.S. military is not a ""poor man's force."" 
The data shows the force is more educated than the population at large. Servicemembers have high school diplomas or the general equivalency diploma. More servicemembers have some college than the typical 18- to 24-year-olds. ""To carry representativeness to the extreme, we would have to have a less-educated force or we would want a lower-aptitude force,"" Gilroy said. 
""The force is a volunteer force; no one is coerced into serving. The military is one option young people have after high school. Military service offers money for college - money a large segment of the population doesn't have. For those people, the military is an attractive option."" 
From the USA Today article:
That's the view of some critics, such as New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, who writes that ""very few"" of the soldiers fighting in Iraq ""are coming from the privileged economic classes,"" and that there would likely be no war if rich kids had to fight.

My point is: Well educated ie having a High-School diploma does not equal ""Rich Kids""

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Link's Awakening was just *tight* in a way every other Zelda game isn't. There's a very simple reason for that.

There's no main gameplay/technology gimmick. 

Zelda 1 was revolutionary so it gets a pass, but could be argued to have the gimmick of ""you have no map, no idea where anything is, go find out"" and being completely open-world. That said it's the trailblazer and deserves a pass for its foibles and outdated technology. 

Zelda II was a sidescroller with XP points. A real radical experiment for Zelda, and it pretty much failed. 

A Link to the Past had the dual worlds and set the standard for the 2D series to follow so as such much of its new items can feel like gimmicks and there's a certain... sloppiness that comes with pioneering--though not much. 

Ocarina of Time was the first in 3D, had the time-travel mechanic, and all associated jazz. Much like Link to the Past it has some sloppiness and some ideas that keep the game from being as truly 'tight' as it could be, though to a lesser extent. 

Majora's Mask had the Groundhog Day mechanic. 

The Oracle games had the dual-game mechanic, plus the animal followers, plus the Season/Time-Travel mechanics.

Wind Waker had the ocean mechanics and general aesthetic overhaul.

Minish Cap had the stupid friendship medallions, and the shrink mechanic.

Twilight Princess was basically ""Hey Ocarina-obsessed losers. You really want Ocarina on steroids here it is!"" Not that it's a bad game (far from it), but that plus the Wii waggle plus the Wolf thing always made it feel like fanservice obligation to me.

Skyward Sword has the anthropomorphically designed sword and presumably some sort-of sky mechanic.

Phantom Hourglass was touch-screen based, and Spirit Tracks had the rails.

What does Link's Awakening have other than the whole ""Not Hyrule"" gimmick? Nothing. It's A Link to the Past with most of the bullshit stripped out.

This was in part due to the Game Boy's limitations, but it works in Link's Awakening's favor. There's no room for a 'time travel' or 'transformation' or interface gimmick. There's no alternate map to explore. There's no fancy cutscenes or plot twists or any of that. It's completely straight-forward.

You're on an island. You have to wake the Wind Fish to leave. Collect macguffins at the end of each dungeon to wake him. Use the new item you get in each dungeon to beat it. Do the trade quests, associated mini-dungeons, and use your new items to get to the next dungeon.

That's it. 

There's no ""Collect the first 3 gems then collect the next 7 gems by traveling back and forth through time to unlock new areas, while performing fetch quests or doing long map exploration or going through long mythology-building cutscenes to aid you"" stuff that is really fun but feels a lot looser and fatter than Link's Awakening. 

That's why--despite having the least Zelda-like plot of any Zelda game--I will always pick Link's Awakening as the best representation of what Zelda at it's core *is* to put in a time capsule for our great-great grandchildren to study in school. 

World exploration, mini-quests, and awesome dungeons in a varied and escalating succession until completion with one or two optional sidequests.

That's it. That's all it ever needs to be. Perfection. ","1293845857"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I call objective journalism, ""lying."" It is the result of media consolidation in the late 1800's. Newspaper publishers like Pulitzer and Hearst bought up papers and used wire services like AP and Reuters to cover national stories. Eliminating strong points of view allowed for these papers to split costs by running stories in multiple markets. Before this newspapers had a stronger and more obvious political identity. After, they still did, it was just more in the background and as a result insidious. 

We were all brought up to trust the news and it's objectivity. The influence then could do an end run around our skeptical filters. We were left defenseless as we had news reports telling us what was important. We knew what nationality or skin color was most prevalent among people committing the worst crimes because those were the ones that were reported. Who is on welfare? I know because the news interviewed a welfare recipient. 

We're learning though. I read on one of these posts that it was possible that Julian Assange could both be a sexual criminal and a hero for running Wikileaks, this is the kind of complexity that was stolen from us by objective journalists and is being given back ironically by internet types like Assange, comedians like Jon Stewart and bloggers as well. Narrowcasting on Cable and on the Internet is improving things but we need to have skeptical audiences so that they can hear ALL of the opinions and make educated decisions on their own. 

Thanks y'all for getting me thinking. Have a good New Year!","1293845873"

&gt; A person having expert knowledge of one or more sciences, especially a natural or physical science.

Those are the top three definitions I got through a google search. I hope you'll excuse me for not linking every definition.

The colloquial image of a scientist is that of someone in a lab coat or someone lost in equations. Yes, if you want to make a semantic kabuki dance, you can call all kinds of people scientists, but it doesn't match the colloquial understanding of the term. And I don't see the point in insisting on using the term other than to appeal to the authority that comes with the term.

"answers","t5_2qkeh","I don't know about Lancaster, MN, but I would assume so since it is an out port, not a main port of entry that is a freeway. Just call CBSA and ask them if it's alright at that port.

To cross you would not enter with traffic, you would go off on the side and they would probably send someone to meet you. You may also be denied entry if you can't secure the animal and you have to go inside.

I lived in (and still have a house in) Point Roberts, WA and people there ride horses like they use a car. They cross on horseback, you just have to have the paperwork they want. Another good example is transferring an animal. It will be brought up from the US in a horse trailer, walked across the border and then transferred to a new horse trailer.

Obviously they prefer you bringing the animal in a trailer. And they're probably going to have immigration questions for you as to why you are doing this and what business you have. Point Roberts is a lot like Angle Inlet - you have to enter Canada to go anywhere. So they know why you're there. If you're just going on a pleasure ride, you may be turned back. If you're bringing the horse to stud and have paperwork to prove it, anything to add a believable narrative, you're fine.","1293845890"

A big city lawyer went duck hunting in rural Tennessee. He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence to collect the bird, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing.

The lawyer replied, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field. Now I'm going in to retrieve it.""

The old farmer looked the lawyer in the eyes and stated firmly, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here.""

The lawyer huffed angrily, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in the country. If you don't let me get my duck, I'll sue you.""

The old farmer smiled. ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things in Tennessee. We settle small disagreements like this with the Tennessee Three Kick Rule.""

The lawyer asked, ""What's the Tennessee Three Kick Rule?""

The Farmer answered, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up.""

The attorney thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.

The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the lawyer. His first kick to the shin had the lawyer hopping around on one foot when suddenly the farmer planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. The attorney was flat on his belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to pass out.

The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said, ""Okay, you old coot, now it's my turn.""

The old farmer smiled and said, ""Naw, I give up. You can have the duck.""

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Maj. Mark Irwin, a spokesman for the Broken Arrow Police Department, said investigating the case is difficult because it touches on sensitive subjects, but he said that ultimately, the authorities' responsibility is to ensure the safety of the child.

&gt;However, police had ""no prior knowledge of the situation,"" Irwin said. ""This is a real touchy case.""

&gt;Oklahoma statutes allow parents to rely on prayer to try to heal their children up to the point that the child's life is in danger or may face ""permanent physical damage."" 

This...*this* is the problem that can arise from a religious moderate stance. It takes a clearly horrible occurrence that should have been prevented, should never have come about, and determines that it's a ""touchy case"" to take to trial because it brings up the ""sensitive"" topic that it's a little fucking delusional to believe in invisible friends and monsters. Moderate believers are too afraid to face the idea that *they* might be wrong, so they can't come right out and condemn nutty motherfuckers, and you get laws that say it's okay for people to *pray* instead of taking their suffering children to the *doctor* until *their lives are in danger.* ","1293845944"

I've had a few encounters with bad cops, and the ""good"" cops always backed their play.  When I was 15, I was beaten (not too badly) by a drunk cop who had just gotten off duty, and was still in his uniform.  The police chief persuaded me not to press charges.  Was he a good cop or a bad cop?

I was at a yard party that got broken up by the police.  One of the partiers said something mildly rude (not even any profanity, just ""Why aren't you chasing real criminals"" or such) and was hustled off-scene by less-drunk partiers.  After the police had decided (after a bit of verbal abuse, like accusing us of being skinheads) to depart, one of them said, ""Where's the guy in the red hat?""  He rushed into the house, followed by two other cops, and ended up arresting everyone who objected to their illegal actions, a total of five people.  A whole slew of other cops showed up, more than a dozen, and I talked with one of them about how ridiculous the whole thing was.  He didn't like it, but he had the attitude that he had to back the bad play no matter what.  The whole thing was precipitated by one bad cop, but over a dozen other cops backed him up, no matter what, and three of them testilied in court to support him (one didn't show up, and the charge against the person he arrested was summarily dropped).  Were they good cops, or bad cops?

(The real irony, we learned later, was that the cops had come to the wrong address.  We could actually hear the party they were supposed to be breaking up, two blocks away.)

They are always the longest weddings. They are the most demanding by far. 

Worst experience overall was this year when the asians bride mom decided to follow me around the WHOLE time during the wedding telling me ""she is a former wedding photographer"" and trying to nitpick on everything I didn't do ""right"" according to her. She tried to call me out when we were doing the group portraits because the brides arm was littlery 1 inch higher then where she thought ""it was supposed to be"". I then took the bride aside and told her that she needed to remove her mom from the room or else I would have to.

I am not married but yes, all of the weddings photographers I know hired one of their photography buddies.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;Only citizens get to vote

Not actually true. Your right to vote is decided upon by the state in which you reside. States can grant the right to vote for non-citizens if they want. 20 states actually used to grant the right to vote in state-wide elections (including for presidential electors) to legal residents, but none do now. They can also revoke the right to vote to citizens, as long as its not for any of the reasons that the constitution forbids.

&gt;yet every resident gets to pay taxes.

Congress has granted citizenship to most of the territories, including Puerto Rico and DC. But because they're not allotted representatives or senators (DC is allotted electors due to amendment, but PC isn't) they can't vote on them. And, actually, I also think that US citizens who reside in Puerto Rico don't pay federal taxes on income gained from sources within Puerto Rico. They have to pay federal taxes on income from outside of Puerto Rico though.","1293846044"

Second, the issue isn't that he wrote about a bunch of other stuff as well. The issue is that he decided to include it in his writings in the first place. That he considered it worthy enough to include a response to it clearly means that it was at the very least a common idea at the time. If it wasn't a serious charge, why would he write about it? Why would Origen quote Celsus at all if Celsus was just some no-name drumming up some obscure lie about mary? It's obvious that Celsus's words carried weight with them that compared Origen to write a detailed response to it. Have you actually read his works? He doesn't just dismiss it by saying ""oh by the way, such and such Greek heathen says that Mary wasn't a virgin. He's full of shit. The End. Moving on..."" He quotes entire paragraphs of Celsus's writings.

But you're just dodging the ultimate question: so... who impregnated Mary then? Because let's be fucking honest. I find it a lot more believable that she had sex with a man rather than with a god. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

At some point we need to decide on an official basis whether prison is focused more on rehabilitation, punishment, or protection of society.  If it is about rehabilitation then we are going about it in an unproductive way.  If it is about punishment, then conditions should be kept as comfortable as is reasonable for those awaiting trial.  If it is about societal protection, then there is no cause to limit access to recreation in the isolated environment (except in cases where the inmates are determined to be a threat to each other or prison staff).  The system could balance these three factors; however, I would think it would have to be done in a way such that punitive elements could be differentiated from rehabilitative elements.

You're deep within the dark catacombs of your mine. No living thing for miles. Only you, and the cold dark rock. Today you're going to make a new corridor in search of reserves. After tireless mining, you traversed a substantial distance gathering many precious materials. Soon before deciding to return home, you see the characteristic blueish diamond ore and your heart skips a beat. 'I'll mine this reserve and then return home' you whisper to yourself. The first block falls quickly to reveal a black void behind it. You quickly break a couple more blocks and step into the mysterious chamber. Throwing some torches down, you slowly reveal a cavern which seemed to have been inhabited some time ago. A house sits in the center of the artificial cave, slowly decaying, slowly dying.

Torches which had burned out years ago stand like sentinels around the walls. Broken pickaxes and cold fireplaces litter the half mined enclosures. Stale, deathly air encompasses the aged cavern. You creak open the rusty door and light the torches inside. Water drips from the ceiling as tools and books sit in disarray. You hear a solitary footstep outside which echos around the entire cavern. You've been mining all day, you're tired, you're hearing things.

Exploring the house, you think to yourself: 'All these years, I had thought that I had been alone. The animals and I shared this world. There was someone here before me. Someone saw what I saw, felt as I felt, did as I did'. You find a route to the basement. Lighting your way with torches, you descend. A solitary storage box sits in the middle of a vast room. Opening the storage box, you find a couple pickaxes, diamond, and an old picture. A man is standing in his field, farming, surrounded by animals. You recognize the area as your new farm and recall seeing pieces of iron and redstone near it. He must have left it there long ago. A door shuts above. Panicking, you climb the stairs and throw open the door. Nothing. You must be imagining things. Get your stuff and leave.

You descend once again to pick up the loot that you have found. You close the storage box and turn to leave. A man stands at the stairs. His eyes blank and filled with the despair of a lifetime of loneliness. You scramble to unsheathe your diamond sword, but he is already heading towards you. Nobody hears you scream miles underground surrounded by rock. Years pass and a traveller enters a cavern to reveal a broken old home. 

Using torches, he slowly explores. 

He hears your footstep outside but dismisses it. 

He entered your house. Now he must die. 

The last thing he sees is your soulless, white eyes piercing into his heart.

He was accused of having a gun in school, but it was a flare gun, it wasn't his, it was in the glove box of another persons car that he was riding as the passenger. He was labeled ESE in elementary school and never shed the label so technically he was sent to my school instead of being expelled. He was a really smart kid and actually got the highest possible score on his standardized test. He wanted to be an engineer. He was an incredibly respectful kid, always said no sir, yes sir. Anyways, I set him up at a community college and signed him up for the SATs myself. 

There was another one who read more books than anyone I've ever seen. The truth is the classes at this place were really watered down so he would blow through the coursework and then read his own books. He read a different book every day I saw him. He was in an orphanage. In fact, another kid at the school went to the same orphanage except they were complete opposites. The only kid was crazy and would laugh all period like the joker. Anyways, he was a really bright kid and I even went out of my way to buy him some books he couldn't afford but he was picked on. He was a big kid, like 6'3 and 220 lbs. Still, the gangsters at the school didn't take too much to his fancy book learning ways. I always regret not being good enough of a teacher to defend him from all the kids all the time.

He wet started the engine of a Skyhawk jet aboard aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in 1967, by allowing more than the required amount of fuel into the combustion chamber, whence a sheet of flame shot out of the exhaust, causing a missile to misfire on another aircraft.

The incident was to result in nine major explosions on the flight deck, and lead to the death of a still classified number of American sailors, believed to be considerably in excess of the 134 or so the Navy talks about!

He had lost five aircraft previously similarly the property of the US Government, number six would be another Skyhawk with him at the controls that went down over North Vietnam, whence he became a prisoner of war and remained so for the next four years.

He is said to have ""gone over"" to the enemy just as soon as he got there, and to have made over thirty propaganda films on their behalf! There are serious reasons to believe that his aircraft was hit by a Sidewinder air to air missile, fired by another US pilot on behalf of Forrestal's dead.

That he finds pride in establishing a commission that failed to adequately investigate the attacks, while the real perpetrators are hidden out in Zionist HQ, who say what gets published, who goes on TV, and who gets elected.

The wars are illegal and unjust, while the Jews intend to prosecute it all in any case and hang all the American traitors, and write histories that blame Bush, Cheney, Rice, Powell and Rumsfeld, like they wrote histories that blamed the German people for the Nazi atrocities.

While omitting the fact that the top Nazis were Jews, that Hitler was an orthodox Jew who deserted the Reich in 1945, and lived on in Argentina's Hasidic Jewish community until his death in 1987!

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I hear this argument a lot, but I don't really agree with it.  Police officers, due to their line of work, constantly risk making poor decisions that could result in the injury of another person.  In this case, they believed that the person was dangerous, and responded with a significant amount of force.  Certainly a mistake, but it's technically a professional mistake, one they risk making every time they make a judgement call on how to approach a suspect.  If they should be punished more severely for using excessive force, then it's unfair to put them in positions where they might require it (which is impossible due to their line of work)

Most people don't have a line of work that requires them, at times, to become physical with uncooperative people.  It wouldn't make sense to hold police to the same standard as others, because for them a professional mistake has similar consequences to intentional malicious violence on the part of a normal citizen.  An accountant lazily screw up somebody's tax return and what then, they lose a customer and have to pay damages?  A police officer mistakes an accountant for a gangster and somebody gets their arm broken or maybe dies.  (and worse for the police, the other way round and THEY'RE going to be the one hurt)

Police have way more at risk, too.  They approached what they believed was a drunken suspect, and he was much larger than them, (the article describes him as ""burly"").  They panicked and did something stupid.  Maybe they're ignorant and incapable, and made an assumption that the big scary black man was going to respond with violence.  But that's not something that they should have to go to jail for.  Discipline and a bit of retraining is enough.  Worst case scenario they should lose their job, but there are too few police these days as it is, so I'd probably let that slide.

And of course, Mr Harmon deserves an apology from them, and compensation for medical bills, inconvenience, probably future damages and potential costs. Maybe as many as two years wages, depending on how bad it was.  Also he should have his license taken away, because if you have a controllable medical condition and allow it to put you in a position where you are endangering others by driving, you should not be permitted to drive.","1293846165"

prostate cancer is easily treatable as long as there is no mets. depending on the size of the prostate and psa level would allow a treatment plan to be created by a urologist. if your fathers prostate is small say 30 grams then cryoablation of the prostate is an excellent option. Another treatemnt can be monthly anti testosterone shots which would reduce the strength of the cancer (prostate cancer strength is directly related to testosterone levels). this hormone treatment would also allow the prostate to shrink easing symptoms and then leading to use of a surgery. for example a 50 gram prostate after certain number of lupron shots can shrink to 30 grams which would make cryoablation of the prostate possible. in addition there is a radical prostatectomy which involves removing of the prostate completely which has the possible side effects of incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

If you ask a more specific question in regards to what you are most worried about I can answer it better.

I digress.  You, it seems, find yourself in dire straits.  And you need to know that everything you are feeling, all that pain, and lost, and fail, and anger, and everything else?  It matters.

You matter.  That bears repeating... YOU MATTER.  Do you know why?  Because you, my friend, can FEEL.  You see the world in color.  Now this is painful... like looking at a bright light... but you have to understand what a rare gift it is to CARE so much about things.

It happens that there is a downside to this, and that is the pain you feel when things, which it sounds like were beyond your control, go crazy and fly apart like some kaleidoscopic carousel with poor manufacturing quality control and an overpowerful engine...  You have to understand that the ability to feel that pain... to be able to really feel.  What a gift that is.

This capability... no this SUPERpower you possess sets you apart from so many black and white 2 dimensional people that the world is populated with.  You will never be rude to a waiter (without damn good reason)  You will hold children's hand in the dark when they are scared (because you have been scared).

For these subzones in Uldum, it could be that the *default* phase is the ""I haven't completed any quests"" phase. That's the phase you're seeing the deposits in, and that's the phase that you're *not* entering when you change subzones to approach the deposits.

Yes, poetry is poetry. I like poetry; it's awesome. But *if* we're going to have an intellectually honest conversation about the origins of life — and it wasn't my idea to, I just joined in after — then we have to start with the mutual understanding that nobody knows anything.

One thing I did like about Walking Dead (I assume you're talking about the TV show, but this applies to the comic as well) is they treat bludgeoning weapons realistically, as in they don't work as well as most people hope. Something like a baseball bat is a great weapon against a human because they get things like concussions.

This particular point was raised when I argued that if I go to a party, I don't need alcohol to have fun, so for me alcohol is an option only if I like the taste of it, and that I guessed that it was the same for most people (I guess my username fits me). The other guy, however, argued that a lot of people feels that they can't have fun without alcohol, but since ""I have more fun if I'm drunk"" seems close to ""I don't have fun if I'm not drunk"", which in time feels too close to being an alcoholic, they won't tell you that (logic fail, I know).

Since *I* drink because I like what I drink, I thought alcohol was secondary to the act of drinking (something like what [the_word_smith](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/euafb/if_all_your_drinks_tonight_were_replaced_by/c1b02b4) replied - plus, it must be obvious by now, I don't drink alcohol), but reddit has so far proven me wrong (oh, surprise...). I wasn't convinced before, but I'm on my way now (although a demographic study about this would be interesting).","1293846364"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I, too, have had the feeling that the theater-to-DVD interval has been sharply reduced, just in the last three years or so.  I associate the three-year timeframe to my having moved to my current house, and started an advanced degree, in 2007.  Available time-and-money for theatre viewing was somewhat reduced, and so we shifted more heavily to DVD rentals, with only an occasional theater trip for things I especially wanted to see ""on the big screen.""  It thus became necessary, when movies came to the theater, to make note of which ones I wanted to see, so that I could be sure to remember to rent them when they came out on DVD.  I was thus very aware of when movies would hit the theater and when they would come out on DVD, and I quickly came to the assessment that the delay was about six months.  Lately I've been caught several times by a movie I want to see in the theater coming out on DVD before I even *get the chance to go* to the theater; last time I ""measured"" it was about two-and-a-half months.  Maybe I'm wrong.","1293846368"

A nice statement, but this is the same mentality that makes /r/skeptic as hostile an environment as it is. There's an odd sort of aggressive intellectualism on reddit, and that isn't as good as it sounds. It becomes less about learning and having intelligent discussions, and more about attacking anyone perceived to be less intelligent.

The problem with this mentality is that it's never going to convince anybody of anything - people automatically dismiss outright hostility, and everything you say along with it. Worse yet, if you're somehow wrong, you're never going to learn a thing if you aggressively defend every position you have, damn the torpedoes. ","1293846375"

The mistake in Star Wars is that 12 parsecs converts to about 40 years. I don't think making the Kessel run in 40 years is going to impress anyone.

If you go outside the movies and allow things from the books or games, then there is another explanation. The route to Kessel was normally 18 parsecs distance, and involved going near a black hole. The exact distance depended on how close you came to the event horizon. Come to close and you fall into the black hole. 18 parsecs was the best you could normally do. The Millennium Falcon was good enough to cut it closer than other ships, and cut the distance to 12 parsecs, which presumably took 2/3 the time other ships do.

I'm also pretty sure that birth control pills can affect wetness as well.  A woman produces cervical mucous during her whole cycle but she makes the most during ovulation to help the sperm get to the egg. (The cervical mucous is also really slippery during this time).  Birth control pills work by tricking your body into thinking it is pregnant, so I'm betting that a woman's body wouldn't be producing as much mucous.

&gt; &gt; To make matters worse, the night before that I had hooked up with someone else when he wasn't there

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've never just hooked up with people

You, my friend, have just had the rare privilege of witnessing an inadvertent fault during operational deployment of the Automatic Defense System (also called Anti Slut Defense).  This is a highly evolved mechanism that lets a slutty woman indulge in the delusion that they aren't slutty.

Other variations of the ASD include:

&gt; - It was 1000 miles away, so it doesn't count as cheating.
&gt; - It was just a one-time thing.
&gt; - Trust me, I never do what I am doing right now *groan, moan, puff, ooooh*.
&gt; - But he didn't put his penis in my vagina (of course he put his penis everywhere else...) 
&gt; - But we never hooked up!  (the guy didn't want to hook up with her, but she would have definitely hooked up with him, had he wanted to)
&gt; - (thinking) OK, I've bedded this and that and this other guy, and this and that and this and that, but only X and Y were my boyfriends. (switch to speaking mode) No, sugar, I've only ever been with two guys in the past.

The most effective liars univocally believe their lies themselves.  Cognitive dissonance, the darkest art of them all.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","The Pollyanna approach to life often bothers me as well, and I see it a lot in pretty much every aspect of reddit. From dating advice to talk of medical conditions. I suspect in a lot of ways it's more a symptom of a demographic very heavily weighted to white, middle to upper middle class, early 20 somethings. From birth to then they've been given a lie about how the world works. That it's somehow fair. They might understand it's not on an intellectual level, but they've never seen anyone dying in pain. They've never seen anyone actually starving, or dying from a medical condition that should be treatable, or actually 'talked' with the dying elderly in an honest way instead of the sugar coated discussions gandparents give to their family. On an emotional level, they just haven't gotten that some people are destined to die in the gutter after being shit on by life. In large part too, I think, because the whole guilt of the privileged tends to be quite real. Nobody likes recognizing that life is both unfair, and that they've been given a life of privledge that they really have no special right to. That it's just a totally unfair roll of the dice by an uncaring universe that might also squash them at any moment. ","1293846452"

"cars","t5_2qhl2","&gt;After a lease, you're left with nothing. If you buy the car, you can always resell it (WRXs hold their value).

Hang on. You have to do the math. If you can lease a $30,000 car for $400/mo for 36 months with a lease-end value of $14,000, that's a good deal. A lease end value of $16,000? Not a good deal. If you get a LEV of $12,000 it's a great deal.

I leased a Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder that had a low lease end value and a high resale value. 24 months into my 48-month lease I sold it, paid off the lease and pocketed $2000. I had a lease on a Ford F-350 dually that I made $3000 on. It all depends.

Also, the ""you have nothing"" is sort of the point. If you pay $500 to own a car and $300 to lease it, you could just pay $300 to lease it, put $200/mo into a CD and when you bring the car back and have ""nothing"" as you put it, take your $7,200 in the bank that you earned interest on and go do something fun.

A car a depreciating asset. You're saying it's better to invest your money in your car, I am saying it's better to invest your money in something that doesn't depreciate. Furthermore, if your car gets damaged, even with gap insurance you could be out all of your equity in the car. It's only worth what it's worth...LOL. And if someone rear-ends you and the car gets fixed, your equity is gone because your car is worth far less. Leasing includes gap insurance AND if the car's been in an accident, not your problem.","1293846459"

Go to a cheap store and buy items such as peanut butter, bread, fruit, nuts, spam, etc. Stuff that does not spoil easily. Go to a fast food restaurant and pick up condiments. Now that I look back on it, worst meal I ever ate was cold spam covered in ketchup on stale hamburger buns. At the time I was starving so it was delicious. Also, make sure you have toilet paper in your car even if you are in the city. Seriously.

I used to shower at the YMCA every couple of days. Furthermore, don't just look for a job from your laptop. Clean up, go out there and hit the pavement. Take any job you can, somewhere where you can get in quickly (as long as you are making more than your unemployment). Make some money to get back in your place and then look for a better job.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I just don't think I can go so far as to say that religion as a whole is bad. I absolutely agree that a great, great many bad things are done in the name of religion, I'm just not sure eliminating religion would solve those problems.

I don't think that 9/11 *wouldn't* have happened if there was no such thing as Islam (etc).

Whether religion should be eradicated is an entirely separate argument, however, and not one I particularly want to engage in. It's been debated endlessly, to little avail. I also feel that, like many who use religion as a force for evil, there are plenty who use it as an excuse for good. Me, I don't really need or want religion, but I believe in freedom of choice. If you (well, probably not *you*) want to worship the FSM, that's fine.

I think we agree that the ""Islam"" part of ""radical Islam"", from the cartoon, is more coincidental than causal, i.e. that it's not Islam in particular that's bad, but fundamentalist Abrahamic religion. And I'm absolutely with you that fundamentalists are generally not a force for good in this world.

In the specific case of Osama bin Laden, I'd point out that, at some point, his beliefs likely mirrored his parents. They're not masterminding terrorist attacks, to the best of my knowledge. It is my feeling, and I'm unlikely to be dissuaded, that ObL was just a bad egg.","1293846526"

I read a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Exact-Replica-Figment-My-Imagination/dp/0316027669/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293845487&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0) that really helped.  

I think what I struggled with most was not losing the baby, because I understand that our bodies have an amazing way of taking care of genetic anomalies we'd have a difficult time dealing with, but the fact that all my plans were totally derailed.  In a way, having my first pregnancy be a miscarriage taught me a lot about who I was as a person.  I was an obsessive planner who needed to relax more.  I do now.  We're expecting again, but I go 3 or 4 day stretches without thinking about it, well except when I'm not throwing up.

Similarly, the best thing I ever did after that miscarriage and before getting pregnant again was to stop thinking about babies and being pregnant.  I know it's almost impossible.  You said you've taken on a project, don't give it up.  We remodeled our back porch and bathroom in an attempt to divert focus from the miscarriage, lol.  Everyone says babies cost a lot of money, sometimes it's in ways you don't expect.   

You will get pregnant again, don't even worry.  I've heard a lot of success stories from ladies with PCOS.  I know that's anecdotal, but a little positive thinking never hurt anyone.

If you ever need to talk, feel free to PM.  The person who helped me the most was not my mom, not my sister, not any family member.  It was the friend I hadn't talked to in quite some time who'd had a miscarriage as well.  She was the only person who really understood.

The fees they charge are exorbitant. The businesses that participate carry *all* of the burden of the deal, and groupon takes 53% of the sale price of the groupon *after* the discounted deal. 

For some types of businesses this is more than fine, but for ""resellers"" such as restaurants that buy product to sell it to customers, getting paid 20% of retail is typically not a good business model for positive cash flow. Of course they sell the idea as ""well, there is a cost to advertise"" and ""most people spend more than the face value of the groupon"" and this does happen, but bargain hunters are bargain hunters, and the more popular these deal sites become the higher number of bargain hunters they attract.

Flash can be used early on to net a few kills. It also allows you to escape early ganks from shaco/eve/udyrs with red buff, whereas you're going to die either way with cleanse if you haven't hit 6 yet. 

Pros of Cleanse:

Shorter CD, better utility in team fights. It might save you a few times early on, but rarely will you net extra kills because of it. Since the premise of Kassadin is to snowball as hard as you can when it hits midgame, I don't think Cleanse is that strong of a choice.

This was annoying, because you would have to write out a string of complex characters for just one word.

It looks like that 亜米利加　is pronounced (amerika), which makes sense.  ""Mei"" is just an unvoiced ""bei,"" the ""a"" is still pronounced that way, and the ""ri"" and ""ka"" characters actually were used to derive the katakana ""ri"" リ and ""ka"" カ, which you can actually see in the kanji themselves.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","&gt; So... will these classes even help me or are they just a waste?

If you're looking for third party recognition, you won't get it. The only thing that gets recognized is proper degree courses, and the value is biased towards notable institutions. The certificate is essentially useless.

&gt; Additionally, would the classes help me if I were to apply for a Master's in CS?

No, they wouldn't. The most you can get past is an intro to programming class.

The main value for these courses is a getting started push. There's the initial hand holding to help you through the basics, and you can then continue on your own or through other avenues (formal education) for proper study. Do you need this? I think it's a waste given the current availability of free resources and ease of pathway for programming. Programming isn't a black art, but it's been made pathetically easy to get into with the amount of freely available quality material on the net.

&gt; I think if I took the classes I could maybe get assigned to a project? Or gain more responsibilities at least.

Maybe, but I doubt it. It's a bit like: oh, you took a few classes on guitar playing? You're ready to play in front of an audience now. Not exactly.

Honestly, save your money. There are better avenues to spend it (good books).

Pick a programming language and start with introductory books. Just practice writing programs of increasing complexity. Be creative and come up with ideas for things to create, and make them. This is how you build up your problem solving skills. Then you can start tackling significantly more complex programs that require more specialized knowledge.

So things to consider:

- Pick a programming language. I recommend Python for a first language. I think C# and Ruby work as well.
- Look at what learning resources are available for your language. Get a good introductory book. There are plenty of reviews on Amazon, on websites, etc. If you are concerned a book choice, you can ask here...
- Follow book and learn fundamentals of language.
- Write programs. Lots of programs.
- There are freely available courses from MIT and Stanford. High quality material that you can use if you want some kind of guidance.

Does it hurt that you don't have a CS degree? CS is theory, while programming is practice. Sort of like, electrical engineers and electricians. Which one do you call for wiring issues in your home? This is known in the industry, which is why programmers are evaluated on their projects. And they get tested during the interview process. Don't hide behind your degree. Develop a portfolio of showcase projects, and use your English degree to augment it. You can program and you can communicate clearly...","1293846690"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","To hijack this, it's a bit like being an airline pilot. The standards of practice, particularly in sensibly staffed Emergency Department, are designed to have multiple layers of safety. Those are usually maintained by different people at different points in the chain. 

We do occasionally say things like 'it takes three fuck ups to kill a patient', and some people do come with two fuck-ups built in. But what we really mean when we say that is that if you're a tool (or have illegible writing) and write 100mg of morphine rather than 10mg, then hopefully the nurse will notice either at first glance (usually he will indicate his notice by gently bellowing that you're a moron, but he fixed it) or notice when he has to take out ten vials rather than the more usual one vial. And should both of you be idiots, the fall back position is that since you're a 'safe' hospital, you keep naloxone as well as morphine. 

So there are buffers against hurting people - that's not to say you can be complacent, but if you're acting in your scope of practice, it's meant to take a bit of effort to kill someone accidentally. 

It *personally* bothers me a lot, but then again, I suspect I'm less experienced than the OP.

Though in my current campaign, since there are multiple paladins, I have found it useful to use the alignments as an objective morality system outside the motivations of the characters and above the muck and complexity of every day life. 

It got to be really interesting when the party was working really hard to achieve their ends and still keep the paladins in the party when one party member was committing war crimes. There was also some confusion among the party that I was trying to enforce morality on the players. I had to keep reminding them that alignment shift has consequences for certain classes.

And I guess we just see things differently. When you say ""you need to conform to A, B, and C to be welcome at this table,"" I see that as excluding people rather than them excluding themselves. I think the inclusive take on things would be ""this is an open table which you are welcome to if you so desire, and I hope and pray that you will come to see A, B, and C.""

"science","t5_mouw","Well, my point is that morality, based off of whatever laws in the universe turn brains states (happiness, sadness) into value states (consciously feeling good or feeling sad) absolutely *is* universal, but what isn't universal is the animal ability (mine, yours, or dolphins') to comprehend those laws.

Morality, in my view, is not something handed down on high from ""God"" or dreamed up by individual men and women, but is an *equivalence of conscious value-states* (created by the Universe out of brain states in just as regular a manner as it creates particles out of quarks) *and judgement*. In other words, saying ""creating pain is morally wrong"" is like a tautology, where what we're in fact saying is ""creating badness is bad"". After that, it's all commentary.

I know that's a big topic and that I'm have absolutely no way of ""proving"" it to you, since among other problems, you're free to turn the issue into a question of semantics, but what I'm saying is internally consistent at the least :D

EDIT: I added stuff.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","The entertainment industry has been doing this for decades.  When TV was invented, movie houses had to start inventing new gimmicks.  Old 3D, Stereo, Widescreen, Dolby Digital, THX, moving seats, new 3D.  Every time a new technology is worked into a TV, theaters need a new gimmick to get people out of the house.  

Same thing with video games.  Remember those awesome 80's arcades?  They're all dead and gone because you can play those games in your house.  

There is a staggering amount of technological advancements in entertainment created for the sole purpose of getting you off your ass to go somewhere and pay money, and it's only going to stop when you can simulate sex with anyone you want while sitting in a couch at home.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; Semantics aside, the point I was really intending to make was that scientists had enough confidence in their theories (and you're right, no one really though Newton was wrong) to deviate from generally accepted scientific practice. They were willing to make predictions about the world based, not off direct evidence, but purely off the strength of the theory.

Indeed. It is also my opinion that this is one of the moments that show how people started to trust the scientific method more and more; 200 years ago, people would have probably added a new set of terms to Newton's laws because they did not have enough trust in inductive reasoning. It's part of the why and of the how they struggled and struggled with equants and complicated heliocentric model.

The revolution itself probably happened earlier but this is indeed one of the earliest moments that show how the majority of the scientific world had radically changed their approach. This happened only about half a century after Fourier's peers laughed at the idea that any function could be represented as a sum of sine and cosine functions, which seemed at best bold, if not foolish, to them -- the Fourier transform, which is now fundamental to signal processing and heat transfer theory.","1293846850"

DADT has not been officially repealed for the Army, it is 60 days from the repeal of the law.  The brass need to change programs and disseminate what is legal and what is not legal.

From reading Eric's post he doesn't agree with Homosexuals in the military and its his prerogative to have that opinion and state it publicly.  However once the policy changes and if there is a gag order on preventing a person from stating that view then he might be in conflict.  If his specific denomination states homosexuality is an abomination (which it probably does in his case), then you are looking at a case of religious expression versus rights.

He's having a cordial discussion that apparently you can't handle and decided to try to cause the person actual issues.  You posted enough information, the persons name, he's an officer in the Army and his Wife's first name as well.

In my opinion by posting private information on Reddit you have the intention of causing Eric financial harm.  You have violated this policy in Reddit:

Actually, all that would be required is that they be comparably useful.  There's no reason that they have to be *more* beneficial, at least not under the framework you've outlined thus far.  

Back to your first post, I just wanted to clarify, are you arguing that suffering is an amoral element to the whole question?  In other words, would your personal system of ethics disagree with the statement: ""I believe it is unethical to cause needless suffering in another being""?  If you really don't personally agree with that, then I guess there aren't many appeals that can be made to you from that (somewhat sociopathic) standpoint, but if you agree with that, then we're back in the realm of suffering being one of the standards for what constitutes ethical treatment.","1293846918"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I partially disagree with Nausved. Unless you have some degree of liver or renal impairment, a high protein diet won't really put you at any risk of developing disease. It's the other factors associated with a high protein diet (namely, cholesterol) that are responsible for most of the negative reactions to the Atkins diet (the recent no-carb fad diet.)

A high protein diet may produce noticeably different appearances in urine, and extra water will make that less so. Proteins are broken down and the nitrogenous waste products are subsequently concentrated in the kidneys. A healthy pair of kidneys really shouldn't have any trouble with concentrating this, though, and wouldn't *need* an appreciable increase in water consumption.

The excess protein will, as stated by Nausved, be converted to fat storage just as extra caloric intake from sugars or fats.","1293846922"

However, this holiday season I was reminded of another seldom commented aspect of electronic anything. While waiting on the tarmac at airports, both pre-takeoff, post-takeoff, pre-landing and post-landing there was a moratorium on electronic devices of any kind, whereas those of us with antique printed materials just kept right on reading through very long pauses in the transportation queues. (Not that even the off duty pilot next to me paid any heed whatsoever to the electronics blackouts despite a warning that it could theoretically mess up the plane's nose end sonar!!!) 

The other weird one that I didn't know until just recently is that not all e readers support flipping backwards in text to reference previous material. That, alone, would be a deal killer for me, not to mention that few e reader platforms even access some of the better field manuals and trade specific reference materials. ","1293846923"

Me: Sounds like a real problem, Badlaundry. Let me first explain that I admire an Airman with enough common sense to at least fear a potential military whore. If you date this woman, she's pretty much guaranteed to be your wife one day. Or at least, your baby's mama.

Here are some options: 1) Politely tell her that you're not interested. 2) Date her and retire after 20 years as a crusty old MSgt with a shitty job at the VA/USPS/on the base until you die. 3) Tell her you have an extreme clit biting fetish in the hopes that she refuses to have anything to do with you.

Have a nice Air Force day.","1293846924"

Now, I wouldn't say that I'm not attracted to my bf, but I would say that I really miss the excitement from when we first dated.  There was a short time we were having sort of routine and boring sex.  We revived that (unintentionally) by sort of reenacting our first time.  It really felt as great as it did the first time.  I got butterflies in stomach. 

About the skidmarks, I know you were kidding (kind of), but you really have to do your best to avoid that stuff.  We have a limited fart/burp rule. I think if you are open with him about it you could do things for each other.  Maybe spice up the sex with role-playing or maybe even by dressing up for a date at a fancy restaurant.  Who knows?

If an animal lacks intelligence he would be too alien for me to imagine what it is like to be him.  But intelligence isn't the only factor.

&gt;I think this is an honest video game scale because it's actually what we're looking for in reviews, is a game worth our $60 and our time. 

The scoring system should only take into account the *quality* of game in comparison to other games in its genre at the time of review.  The scoring system only exists to enable one to *filter* the good from the bad and upon having done so the *review* itself should be used to assess whether one considers a purchase necessary.

A reviewer should be assessing the quality of a game *not recommending a purchase*.

What good is score, where price was considered an important factor, in 20 years when the game is essentially free?  It becomes nigh on worthless.","1293846978"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Post production houses have render farms and terabytes of disk space. Render farms are groups of processors on the network for the purpose of doing the heavy work (rendering, simulation, etc) which is faster because you can distribute the work across multiple machines (rendering one frame per processor, for example), while keeping the users machine free so they can work on other tasks at the same time. A jobs files are usually divided across multiple disks on the network, but made to appear like they are in a single directory structure. Managing the farm, distributing and managing the tasks that are running, and watching and moving data around the disks, is known as wrangling (although usually the two tasks are separate jobs).","1293847043"
"ruby","t5_2qh21","The methods work differently than the constructors. They're more like massagers/mungers than the .new() methods. For example, Array(3) and Array([3]) both return [3], which makes it ideal for taking a variable that could be a single element or an array and either casting it to an array of one element or leaving the array unchanged. It's equivalent to ray = [ray].flatten(1), but ray = Array(ray) is just nicely readable. 

I suspect that the methods exist because of Python's ability to define the __call operator on a class; I would love it if Ruby allowed the same thing, but it's not lexically possible as long as Ruby's parentheses are optional. There's no way to distinguish between Array (a class) and Array (the method call). I think this is why there was a brief spate of writing class methods named []. Mercifully it never caught on, but Array and Proc still sport them. (And of course, Array[] does not behave the same as Array(): Array[[1]] =&gt; [[1]], Array([1]) =&gt; [1]. Sigh/Heh.)","1293847044"

It doesn't matter how many dealerships you go to, unless you are experienced, you're not going to get that good of a deal. If you go with Costco, you'll get $100 above invoice. Subaru dealers are not well-known for just blowing stuff out. In fact, Subaru discourages it. Leasing is an important part of their business which is based upon the secondary market and resale value. If you sell cars for less, they are worth less when people go to sell them. That's why Subaru has such awesome lease rates. It's based upon the projected value of the car.

As a side note, a great car to buy is a car that has excellent leasing. That means the manufacturer is standing behind the idea that their car is going to be worth something.

I wouldn't lease the WRX because Subaru doesn't have aggressive programs for it. They don't have to add that incentive. The same goes for finance rates. In most cases you will get a better rate from a credit union, so prequalify beforehand. Leasing is fine on certain cars and makes, but I can already tell you that you'll be able to get out of this car in a few years without leasing. Just don't trash it. A stock WRX is actually a more valuable vehicle because it's unadulterated. 

Let's see what else...assume you're going through Costco, because you are. Get a quote from the F&amp;I manager on an extended warranty as well as from companies that sell them, including the tire warranty. On a car like that, it's a good thing. And if the car has a warranty, it's more valuable when you sell it.

If you're going to drive it in winter climes, also get it oiled underneath. Protects from rust. That's a huge one. And when you insure the car, absolutely pay for gap insurance in case it's ever totaled or stolen.","1293847081"

"environment","t5_2qh1n","But black carbon *is* “actually bad for you”—it get trapped in your lungs, causing health issue.

Here’s what WHO has to say about it:

&gt;*Definition and principle sources*

&gt;PM affects more people than any other pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, carbon, mineral dust and water. It consists of a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air. The particles are identified according to their aerodynamic diameter, as either PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 µm) or PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 µm). The latter are more dangerous since, when inhaled, they may reach the peripheral regions of the bronchioles, and interfere with gas exchange inside the lungs.

&gt;*Health effects*

&gt;The effects of PM on health occur at levels of exposure currently being experienced by most urban and rural populations in both developed and developing countries. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer. In developing countries, exposure to pollutants from indoor combustion of solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections and associated mortality among young children; indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is also a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer among adults. The mortality in cities with high levels of pollution exceeds that observed in relatively cleaner cities by 15–20%. Even in the EU, average life expectancy is 8.6 months lower due to exposure to PM2.5 produced by human activities.

I don't really care if a girl is au natural with her hair or not; it's kinda sexy because it's outside the norm, as long as she smells good. I go in cycles, personally, where I want to shave or don't want to shave for my own aesthetics, so I don't really care as long as I can get to her tasty bits with ease, though if I'm not in a relationship with a person (and they don't smell), it doesn't matter *what* I think.

Perhaps you can get one of them to go do that with you or if your other friends are interested in that kind of thing then that makes it even easier.

"LaTeX","t5_2qhbn","* The ~ (tilde) character is used to control spacing in text and expressions. 
* \quad can be used conveniently for wider spaces when, say, aligning expressions to specifications
* If fonts other than the default ones are needed (i.e. Times New Roman), it's easier to use XeTeX as opposed to LaTeX.
* The a4symbols.pdf file floating around is the best guide to LaTeX+ams symbols.
* For commutative diagrams, I like using xypic.
* For generic pictures/diagrams, I love TikZ/PGF. TikZ is extendable to circuitikz to handle circuits more easily.
* set margins as an option to the geometry package as in 

        \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}

* presentations are done with the beamer class files.
* matrices with brackets or parentheses are more easily accomplished with \bmatrix or \pmatrix respectively as opposed to using \left[...\right] or \left(...\right)
* when writing papers, it's usually easiest to tweak a professional template like the ams (math) one or the revtex (physics) one.
* Learn to use BibTeX for all your bibliographic needs. I would put all citations in a separate file with some smart keying.

edit:

* use backticks `` for left quotations and double apostrophes for right ones.
* as mentioned below, use the align environment as opposed to the deprecated eqnarray
* \cite for citing references, \ref for referring to eqns and figures
* my editors of choice are either emacs with the auctex extension or textmate. I hear good things about the ViM extension too
* use textheworld to type tex in email and other places.
* another important one, if you want to have a large brace, bracket, pipe, or parenthesis without a matching one, pair it with a \right. or \left. as in

        -\int_0^\infty e^{-x} dx = \left. e^{-x} \right|^\infty_0 = -1

It may be because the number of responses was under the threshold, or for some other reasons - they might've for example, made demographic adjustments for other factors such as male/female or income or whatever, in order to match the overall set with the real country, but there may have been too few responses of the appropriate type in the 18-34 group to be able to make that same adjustment accurately.  I don't see an explanation in this PDF for why they thought their 18-34 number should be left off, so it's best not to jump to conclusions.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","You may be surprised to hear that between the time I wrote in reply to you, ted_whileman has quite nicely put me in my place and I am feeling both released of my concern about my concerns (thanks to my ranting) and convinced that Harris is making a point that has a critical audience (pointy-haired liberals).      
    
But since there are still some unresolved misunderstandings between us, let's hit a couple more points.    
    
I don't want to be convinced of ""this"". What did you mean when you said ""this?"" I would love to have clarity on moral questions. I am endlessly muddled. And I have to admit that even though these philosophical debates that right and wrong is objective are indeed old matters in philosophy (utilitarians were ""just"" saying that secular evaluations of what hurts people vs. what makes them happy is a worthy substitute for fundamentalist scriptural ethics--and they won the debate on many fronts, such as slavery, routine torture of petty criminals, etc.), they are worth reframing and pushing to the fore because people in the international sector really are using cultural relativism as a blank check for what are, in my mind, true crimes (mainly in the Muslim world as far as I can see, though your example of sexuality is a good one insofar as I agree that a mature and humane prostitution industry or consensual sex between teenagers should be legal). 

Harris is definitely affirming, not introducing, ""well-being"" as a unit of measure for what's good for the world. It's the basis for the globally espoused ethics of the UN Millennium Development Goals, among many other things.   
   
Sam's new argument in this book isn't that it's immoral to have religiously mandated laws, I'm １00% on board with that claim, because my morals (which come from philosophy), prioritize prevention of human suffering over cultural tradition. I've always liked Sam's (and your) critiques of such things, because our moral philosophies align. I disagreed earlier that it was a big deal to announce to the world that ""hay, we're scientists and we can measure suffering and well-being"" (which seemed obvious to me given that I'm surrounded by academics who do exactly that and are involved in politics/public health). I still disagree that science tells us that suffering and well-being are the end-all and be-all of morality (as Sam repeatedly implies in his talks).    
   
I'd also like to recommend a short reading to you, the freely available [preface](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Ethics-Leslie-Stephen/dp/141020782X#reader_141020782X) to Leslie Stephen's *Science of Ethics*, published in 1882. Gives a short intro to some books on the topic that seem to me to be historically relevant predecessors to Harris.     
     
I think you think you're at the start of a revolution, while I think you're in a revolution against the religious morals that is 90% complete in the USA and even higher in some liberal European countries.   
     
I don't cringe at destroying human life. I'm in favor of keeping abortion legal and by the logic I described, killing skin cells should also be illegal in a few years once we can grow them into clones of ourselves too. The burqa argument is very easy to follow but it doesn't address the fact that the reason for the burqa has nothing to do with human suffering, it involves other dimensions of morality that are not really part of science, they're part of philosophy. ","1293847238"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I'm sympathetic to your viewpoint.  Disposable culture has wreaked havoc on our environment and given us cities and suburbs that are devoid of meaning, authenticity, or continuity.  Many are just plain ugly.  

However... 
There is NO such thing as a permanent building.  Several reasons:

.  
(1) Weather and nature are formidable foes.  
One of the hard lessons that architects learn, is that a building is one of the *least* enduring pieces of art.  Paintings and pottery have better odds of survival.   I've seen plenty of empty stone or brick shells from what *used* to be a building before the roof fell in.  Constant maintenance is required.  Efforts to make a building low-maintenance often have the side-effect of making it uglier.

.  
(2) Changes in lifestyle.  
Sometimes this just means changing the floor plan.  Other times, this means the underlying land use has changed, and therefore the whole building gets razed.  I read that in Tokyo, the average age of a building is 24 years because of the constant reconstruction.  

[edit to add:  Within a few miles of where I live,  I can think of two large stone houses that used to be majestic but are now neglected due to location.  In one case, the main street and a back alley of an old ""town"" (of only 30 houses or so) got converted into opposite lanes of a 4-lane highway, meaning the house now sits on a glorified highway median.  In the other case, the farm adjacent to the house was sold to a developer who put big-box retail on it.  The owners of the stone house now look out their front window to see a towering windowless 25-foot high concrete wall that is the back of a warehouse-style store.  My point is simple: It takes more than stone construction to make a house last.]  

.  
(3) Technological change.  
Electric, plumbing, windows, HVAC, insulation, fire code, etc. continue to change dramatically.   Owning an old house can be compared to owning a classic car, such as a 1927 Lincoln-- it's a work of art, high quality craftsmanship, and a real privelege to own.  Unfortunately, it's also a money pit utterly unsuited to the modern daily commuting needs of the masses.  What used to be an asset has become a liability, which the rich can afford, but the average person cannot.","1293847238"

2) Try your hand at electrolytic cleaning, parts can be had a home depot and will cost less than $20. Cleaning solution is a solution of vinegar and ammonia. Use google for details.

3) Slug lap your bore. This is cheap, can be done at home, but is labor intensive. Eat lots of carbs and bring a couple big friends over. Again, google will help you with this.

4) do a chamber cast or have a chamber cast made by a competent gunsmith.

5) Buy a cheap, single stage reloading press and find what load works best for your rifle. You might want to slug your bore and measure the actual diameter. Barnes (and others) make .311"" pills (but they cost a little more than the more common stuff that's out there for .308""). 

This process will help you get closer to your goals and should be challenging (read: fun) to do. You'll walk away with a nicer shooting rifle, too.

Are you planning to bed the action?

If you really want to put on the crazy pants you can buy a barrel bedding block and inlet/float the receiver and all but the first 6"" of barrel.


EDIT: addendum to 5: Use a neck sizing die. There are ""collet"" or ""bushing"" dies that allow you to increment your neck OD by increments of 0.001"" to get the right amount of neck tension.


Also: Trigger job, google should be able to help there also.

Everyone (and everything) I interact with is an extension of myself, thus I will treat them with the utmost respect and care.  No bug dies by my hands and I love the rock, the leaf, the root and everything I stepped over to get to the park today.  I'm the most down-to-earth person you'd ever meet.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I can appreciate that, and your right, once again to beat the dead horse that is ""Dawntreader"" we can see how well it works. Yes maybe the honcho's at prime were a bit over zealous, maybe they should have said no, but like it or not they didn't, and had they it wouldn't have mattered, any of a half dozen other houses would have taken it. Houses like these make a normal vfx houses margins look luxurious right now. In three just got bought out by DD and they did it with out hesitation because it is a much more stable environment and they can work with DD much closer on future projects which helps both of them. 

Not taking the job would have potentially created worse results for hundreds of people than taking it. AND while I can appreciate that they ""done goofed"" in the worst possible way, it's hard to work on a project like clash and get it sullied by the 3d, much like Last airbender, accept that had a worse story and plot and just as shitty a 3d experience. 

I feel for you, I do, trust me as a person whose spent months on projects before only to see the shelved or not given the air time they deserve or had my best most fantastic shots cut, I understand the pain of seeing your work fucked with. Just understand, it's not primes fault, it was destined to be once the producers got it in their head that 3d would be worth it. Thankfully leveler heads prevailed on both HP7 and Dawn treader, one realized the results were not up to par and pulled the 3d, and the other realized they needed more time and proper testing, and even though the movie was shot and specifically told it wasn't going to be done in 3d conversion or otherwise, we see the end result of that and it turned out well.

Life sucks some times in this world, our voices often go unheard, and the loudest voices in the crowd are often wrong. The only hope we have of changing the flaws around us are to rise up on the shoulders of great work and make a stand saying this is how we run things, this is how it's done, take head and follow us! This is why the London houses dominate so hard recently, As a collective they are stronger than any single house, and they realize competition is good, but war only hurts those who fight.

Probing this evidence shows that there is very little but, more importantly, exposes the New Testament as an unreliable historical text. 

If Christians can believe there is great and much evidence for Jesus' existence it's very easy for them to accept his fantastical nature. If Christians are exposed to the actual evidence, regardless of his existence as a human, it becomes much more difficult to claim his divinity. ","1293847280"

"politics","t5_2cneq","While the framers were writing the constitution, we need to assume that they chose each and every one of their words with intention.  They were forming the blueprint for a COUNTRY not bs-ing a college paper.

I'd like to point out that this author first quotes the constitution as ""provide for the general welfare,"" which makes it seem like the federal government is responsible for the general welfare of the people.

However, when he actually inserts the Preamble in his article, the quote is ""...promote the general welfare...""

To PROVIDE something and to PROMOTE something are two very different things.  The framers wanted a hands-off federal government, this is evident in American history.  There is no way they would have ever expected or wanted the federal government to be responsible for the welfare of each and every one of its citizens.

He defines welfare in today's context as well, but the preamble wasn't written in today's context.

But even if we take his definition of welfare, all the federal government is required to do is to promote it, and if ""organized efforts on behalf of the public and private"" to provide for the poor means giving the public incentive to help out (like tax reductions) and the economy the freedom to grow and create jobs, then people can provide for themselves.  The federal government does not PROVIDE.  It PROMOTES.","1293847410"

I also had a terrifying experience with a big, old, german jointer. The power in that thing was something to appreciate.

What kind of nutrition info are you looking for?

For weight loss, it's about carbs and calories.
For weight gain it's about getting plenty of protein and carbs.
For optimum health and maintaining weight, it's about a balanced diet with lots of fresh brightly colored fruits and veggies, lean proteins, whole grains, all preferably organic.

Take a multivitamin.
If you don't get enough sun, take a Vit. D. supplement.
If you're vegan, take Vit. D, Vit. B, calcium, and maybe iron.

"linux4noobs","t5_2qy7t","This is basically what I have been going over.  I have a basic business proposal mapped out, but I am hesitant to even broach the subject. 
I'll address each point you brought up with what I have thought of.

* **Licensing**  Most of the NPs we are working with have had a very hard time getting cooperation from companies like MS.  One specific fought for their Office 07 license for the better part of the year, and finally decided to install Open Office everywhere.  I am not 100% sure about the grants they obtain, but I am fairly certain they are technology grants, and not specific to a vendor. 

* **Distro 1&amp;2** I am partial to RH products, and would lean to them because of the support provided with the pay license.  The switch isn't entirely based upon free software, but more of the comfort and benifits provided with *nix distro's.  That being said, I would not put all my eggs in the RH basket, and be willing to tailor to the clients needs.
Also, I would not recommend rolling out changes to clients who have recently upgraded their systems.  I would look to slowly roll this out to future clients, with the eventual goal of having 100% of clients using 100% *nix systems. That could be a five year, or ten year plan.

* **Support**  This would be a tricky area.  It would require everyone to start learning *nix, but it's not as daunting a feat as it sounds.  Between the plethora of college/community colleges in the area we could start educating our employees in these matters.  I do not believe they will be instant experts, but using the OSs full time will also help expedite things.  Luckily the *nix community is very helpful and friendly.  This would all have to occur before we start to roll out anything. 
I would also look to roll things out slowly, a server here or there, or just one or two front desk computers at clients.  100% switch over immediate would be a serious error.

* **Software** this is the elephant in the room.  Everything is contignent upon the SW being run on Wine or *nix.  Sure we could use a VM, but I think that makes it a ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" situation.  If the SW will not run, the entire argument become mute.","1293847467"

  * Blit the text items onto the surface you set up in step 1 incrementing the x and y positions accordingly
  * Have that single sprite in a group of its own (or you can just have a group for all your text). Single group explained [here](http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.GroupSingle)

"sex","t5_2qh3p","You're lusting.  This happens.  That rush you feel when your lover first holds you, the desire to spend the rest of your life with them, the swooning and the attraction.  A lot of people consider that falling in love, but it's not.  It's lust.  It's lust and it'll go away eventually.  And then you're going to feel it for somebody else, maybe ten times or a hundred times stronger then you did before.  And when you feel that, and you think about your new lust all the time and then go home with the person you're committed to instead, that'll be love. 

You're going to get moments where it comes back though.  You'll look at them the right way or you'll be away a few days and they'll be all that is on your mind.  But it's never going to be a constant thing like it is with a new relationship.

If all you care about is the lust then you can just find a series of new relationships whenever you get bored, but from what I've seen that usually leaves you shallow old and miserable at the end of it all.  You could fantasize about other people, which is a bit unfulfilling, or you can try something you haven't done before.  

What might work: set up a special occasion that has nothing to do with sex but will involve it eventually, like a romantic weekend or something similar, and keep sex out of your mind and let things happen naturally.  Sex on purpose is pretty routine, plan to not have sex but then don't avoid it when the mood is right and you might dodge the ""routine"" feeling.","1293847547"

As a Terran player all I have to do is throw down MULEs (and if I miss a drop or two, no biggie just throw down two).

From your initial description it sounded as though the machines were set up and left largely unmanaged. That was an assumption on my part and I'm sorry to have taken it to a drastic extreme. 

I will stand by my statement that a switch to Linux won't resolve your two stated issues. In some cases it may make them worse if you would be the only person who knows how to really lock down Linux. From my personal, ahem, challenges with Linux(re somehow setting everything on the HD to read only and similar) I can say that a person who thinks they know what they are doing can be extraordinarily dangerous on Linux. In some cases far more so then on Windows. I can't image loosing my current users on a Linux system that's not locked down to an almost prohibitive degree. ","1293847572"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had only flown commercial airlines twice before this particular experience, but from what I saw I didn't think that this was normal to see on a plane. I flew Qatar Airlines home from Japan (it's much cheaper to go over Asia, Europe, and the Atlantic than it is to go straight over the Pacific), and this particular leg of my trip was from Doah to Washington, D.C., so the plane was mostly filled with Middle Eastern and Indian passengers. The flight itself was great, I slept pretty well and the food was good, but let me tell you that there was nothing worse than the smell of the people on the plane or the condition of the bathroom (after my first trip I avoided going for as long as I could handle it). When the plane landed in D.C. and everyone was getting off I could see that the floor was covered with garbage and food, and I mean COVERED, as in every inch of the floor other than the isles. I had never seen a plane get so disgustingly dirty in my life. Maybe it's pretty normal but since I had only flown a few times it was really weird. Or maybe it's due to the cultures of the people flying in the plane? Either way I was appalled. ","1293847574"

Most vegetarians don't eat meat because they prefer not to, but should they be so inclined, they are still capable of it. If a given person is unable to eat meat, but fully able to subsist on plants, then they would be an herbivore.

Sexuality, however, is primarily about what you like. If a gay man were to copulate with a woman it would not make him straight. Similarly, if a cow ate a mouse, it would not become an omnivore. However, if the cow somehow managed to alter itself to subsist primarily on mice (supplemented with grass), it would then be classified as omnivorous.","1293847586"

It's that I think most humans in general, male or female, enjoy effortless sexual release every now and then.

Just enjoy the sensation and the emotional gratification of knowing someone loves you enough to give that to you.""

I can't speak for anyone else, but a quickie with that understanding would be just as fantastic for me. Hell, really, I just prefer the feel of vaginal intercourse in general so I'd prefer it.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Okay, here's another one. Another kid I had was completely delusional. He was 5'5 and weighed 120 lbs or something. He would only answer me or acknowledge me if I referred to him as bird. Yes, bird. He would often come to school claiming to be a gang leader and having gotten sent to this school for beating up the quarterback of the football him. I called his mom on his first day to introduce myself, like I always do, and she laughed her ass off. 

Anyways, this kid was nuts. He would often ask me to give him a hug, and when I told him I couldnt give him a hug, he would accuse me of being a faggot and start screaming at the top of his lungs, ""MR. A IS A FAGGOT! HE WON'T HUG ME!"".

At the school, we would have practice lock downs in case there was a shooter on campus. He was in my class at the time, and when the drill happened, we are all suppose to move away from doors and windows and hide. I didn't tell them it was a drill, they thought it was real. I told them DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR. ITS THE SHOOTER. Well, sure enough someone started to bang on the door. He decided to walk up to the door. I told him ""If you open that door, someone will shoot you"". He opened the door, and the student who was doing the pretend shoot out clocked him in the face and knocked him out cold.

He also had a countdown going until he went back to new york. He started telling everybody that he was going back to live in new york to live with his uncle on the 15th of December. He told everyone this for about a month. On the 14th, he went insane. He took his shirt off, he stood on furniture. He shouted nonsense like ""I'm the bird, can't nobody touch me."" We all figured it was his last day, and so what. Well, on December 16th he showed up to class.

Me: Aren't you suppose to be in New York?

DL stands for dual layer.  All the movies distributed on fanedit come in a the DVD player format.  It will look like a bunch of VOB files in a folder called Video-TS.  Just open the first one with VLC player and it will play the movie.  Or you could actually burn it to a DVD and play it.

Or you could just download the AVI version and play them directly (but the quality is a little less).

You'll need the program [JDownloader](http://jdownloader.org/download/index) to download the files.  You download the .dlc files from fanedit which is an instruction file for JDownloader to download files from places like Rapidshare.

The reason they do that is because they can get sued for directly linking the Rapidshare links.  Plus, it's actually quite convenient to have JDownloader download the files one after another so you don't have to monkey with the rapidshare wait times or captchas.

P.S.  There are fanedits of all kinds of movies.  One of my favorites is the Extended Cut of Waterworld.  It's fantastic.","1293847627"

Imagine that this cylinder of turning space is a track on which you can send single pulses of light.  Each pulse of light would travel around the cylinder in the same direction that the space representing that cylinder was turning.  apearing to almost spiral around the cylinder making its way toward the other end.  if the cylinder was a perfect vacuum, the light would be traveling at the speed of light + whatever speed you could get the cylinder of space to spin at, relative to those outside of the cylinder.

2.) Downloading on the other hand.. is exactly opposite. When you download, you're only connected for very brief amounts of time and you don't (typically) have to transmit any identifiable information to grab the files you need.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Yes, it's vague.  I tend to come to the defense of authors accused of plagiarism for precisely this reason.  

First, though, let's differentiate.  If I decide to write a book about two kids who fall in love despite the fact that their families are bitter enemies and in the end both kids end up dead, you can say that I'm not entirely original.  But you can't say it's plagiarism.

But if I write a balcony scene and it includes:

But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Elizabeth is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.

Then I think we have ourselves a problem.

There is however a lot of wiggle room between those two examples.  It becomes a question on interpretation.  My own approach is to avoid using the ""P"" word unless I see a clear-cut case.","1293847695"

"science","t5_mouw","Lori Marino is a neuroscientist from Emory University, she is very well known in the field. Diane Reiss also well known, she is the one who did the study on dolphin self-recognition (the mirror test).

Dolphins and whales and many other animals are indeed treated like shit by humans (well, so are other humans). But I hope that we will eventually recognize their intelligence.

What people do not realize is that there are hundreds of dolphin species. And all we know so far is based mainly on coastal bottlenose dolphins. By the way, the famous ""rape"" argument only describes one tiny population. Some bottlenose dolphins can indeed be aggressive and often attack harbor porpoises. But it is also known that some ""deviant"" dolphins are often excluded from the group and forced to be on their own, particularly the attackers. However, other species such as pilot whales or rough-toothed dolphins will die for each other and often do during the mass stranding. They literally have each other's back and such empathy has not been shown by any other species (including humans by the way).

The bottom line is we know so very little about whales and dolphins because they live in the environment which is so foreign to us. But based on what we know it is clear that they are highly intelligent species. The article did not go into much detail about their complex communicative system that not only has not been cracked, but also has not been even fully recorded and recognized. There are whales out there like Bryde's whale for example; we do not even have any decent recordings of their vocalizations. Even bottlenose vocalizations have not been studied much, they produce insane number of vocalizations and we do not know what even the simplest of them mean. An evolution does not waste energy on worthless things and vocalizations are costly in terms of energy, so they clearly serve some purpose. The thing is we do not know what it is. 

Finally, it is very important to recognize that dolphins and whales are intelligent species because we have to change our approach towards stranded animals. It is a fact that whales and dolphins strand and we have no idea why. But currently it is OK to shot stranded animals or even detonate their head with explosives while animal is still alive. This is cruel, barbaric and plain horrible. Every stranded animal should be helped, treated with respect and everything should be done to save them instead of shooting and euthanizing them left and right.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I thought I was a pretty moderate WoW player back in the day. I justified myself by saying I was a 4.0 student, had a beautiful girlfriend, was a competitive swimmer at a high level, a cross country runner, and a techie up at the church. Not only that but about 15 of my real life friends from my tiny little school all played on the same server with me. It wasn't moderation, it was just what I did at the end of my night; the same way an alcoholic might get drunk every night to 'chill out' or 'destress' was the same way I got on WoW. And I didn't even really recognize that I really truly was *addicted* in a sick way to this game, even if my 'IRL character' was doing extremely well.

I went off to college and immediately was torn. I knew nobody and I quickly learned that unlike my Highschool experience where social life was 6-8, social life here was from 8p-2a after classes, when raiding happens. I tried to hold onto WoW, and my guild began to get sooo pissed at me because I would continuously duck out and go live the college life. Eventually I found myself disconnected from the game, only sparingly playing on holiday weekends (I live out of state, so I stay at school when everybody goes home normally). It was the new Cat expansion which fully severed my ties to the game, I never bought them. 

As WoW exited my life I realized 'holy cow! It was so much more than I ever thought it was!' And occasionally I'd have these real strong desires to fire it back up and see what was going on. But then I looked at all my highschool friends. It was only myself and about 2 others who stopped playing. All the others went to the same school, had zero new friends, and were all suffering from very bad grades because they allowed wow to go from night time to all day.

You don't play wow in moderation. You just simply don't. And if you're like me and think you do/did.... you'll look back once your done and see just how sad your /played really is. I think the OP, assuming they are with the link's story, is very strong minded. Its easy for a kid or somebody to get locked into an addictive habit, especially one like WoW. It takes a different kind of person to realize what it is and GTFO before they wind up with a crap life because they were busy playing WoW.","1293847751"

 Don't Shave That Hair!
I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble crapping.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my butt-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my buttcheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my butt of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My butt was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two buttcheaks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poo- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky crap/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my butt off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering crap/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my butt cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own crap blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my butt at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for butt-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my buttcheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your butt having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.","1293847815"

2499 *is* better, but it also means that to undercut someone only has to ""lose"" 1 copper to undercut me. 200g difference means someone has to be willing to underprice their merch that much. Generally people like you aren't, and those are the people I am trying to avoid the hassle of selling against.

If you don't like the price, buy my item and relist it closer to what the market is. We both win. I get my money, and you get a free few hundred gold.

This isn't a ""dominate the market"" strategy. This is a ""I just looted one of these and don't want to deal with the hassle of people who are trying to dominate the market"" strategy.

"poker","t5_2qhix","It's totally depends on the situation.  For instance, there are plenty of villians I am willing to get TPTK in against on the flop.  If the board is really wet, and coordinated, then chances are some players are raising a lot of draws as semi-bluffs, bluffing a fair amount, and have a wider value range (because of the more possible draws in my range).  So because of this the value of my TPTK tends to increase.  

You can't just say it's bad to put it in with TPTK, and not make any mention to the villain you are playing against.  It's totally standard to bet/fold TPTK against passive players that will call with so many worse hands, therefore you get value by betting, but they will only raise a very narrow/strong range, therefore you fold your inferior hand to their raises.  Sticking it in with TPTK against passive players who are being aggressive is likely a losing scenario way more often than not.

But sticking it in with TPTK against aggressive players in correct situations is going to arise.  Don't get in the habit of always folding TPTK when facing aggression simply because of it's absolute strength (TPTK).  Instead, you need to focus on your hands relative strength compared to villain's hand range.  Against a passive player raising, you can see your hand is pretty weak.  But against an aggressive player raising on a wet board, you can see it isn't as weak, and might warrant continuing with the hand.

Texas gets the best talent in the country, so I see these teams and I compare them to us and I say to myself ""we could beat them"". While we may have mismanaged our talent this season, I don't doubt we'll correct lots of our mistakes next season. And even this season, we had the ability to play with anyone. We were close to coming back against Oklahoma and we were driving down the field to tie it up at the end of the A&amp;M game when the ball got tipped and picked off. So I think we were a lot better than our record suggests.

I think Richt should have been fired earlier in the season, because I know (all of us at Texas knew) that Muschamp would have taken that job had it opened up. He's a Georgia boy. And with Muschamp there's little to no drop off right away. But now I don't know if there are any other good candidates, so staying with Richt and underachieving for one more year until there are some better candidates might not be such a bad thing.

"linux4noobs","t5_2qy7t","I'll be completely honest, as I was with the sys admins at my current job. Switching to Linux in our own environment was almost completely for own on personal pleasure(and a tiny amount of nerd cred with other departments on campus.) I was able to get it approved and live by taking some very specific, single use machines and starting there. Linux is awesome for this in my experience.

We have a few machines that are only used for clocking in via a webpage, a few others that exist as card scanners(checking in to another web page) and a few machines that are dedicated stations for users(typically hourly or users without standard desks) to check email. These machines were perfect for slowly bringing Linux into our environment. As a corporate environment we don't really pay per Windows license but I was able to use machines that otherwise would have been retired(older machines) and put a very lightweight distro and some somewhat strict restrictions and extend the lifetime of these machines. 

I've been a bit of a negative nelly in your thread here but small, non-essential workstations are an awesome way to start moving some Linux into most environments. And as they prove stable and show they can increase the lifespan of machines in the field slowly Linux expands. Hell we have users who have requested it now simply because they are those 'I want to be different"" users which helps slowly push more into the field. 

TL;DR - Sorry didn't mean to make it sound like you guys didn't manage your shit. There's a way to do this, good luck out there!","1293847950"

[Princeton Study: 75K = happiness](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489)

""75k a year likely isn't enough for the finer stuff in life if you have a family. Like private school, etc. Pretty sure the quality of goods you consume is different at 75k than at, say, 150k.""""

In my own experience, i've found that the ""finer stuff"" you speak of isn't that great or is unneeded by myself. I am a dual citizen living in Canada, so schooling isn't an issue, but even then, Private schooling is 5K-10K a year. I could deal with that if I had to.

The other stuff are usually just money sinks. More properties = more bills. More cars = more insurance. Bigger house = staff to clean/landscape. Everything leads to more and more. At 75K, you can pay your bills, buy yourself something nice once in a while, and not really stress. Keep in mind I say that with Universal Health Care, but hey, not much we can do there...","1293847951"

I'm not implying Harmon was at fault in anyway, but I'm curious as to what provoked the cops.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","No smoking gun so far as that writer is concernned, then, but senior clergy involved, Vatican resources used, Vatican instruments of authority being issued, important Catholic institutions organsing escapes, nothing done to prevent it. 

How good would it be to get inside the Vatican archives?

The Vatican also refuses to open its archives in the matter of [Croatian Holocaust victims](http://www.vaticanbankclaims.com/press2.html) seeking to sue it for compensation from the [Croatian State Treasury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Works_of_Religion#Other_allegations) funds that were transferred wholesale to the Vatican Bank.

There is however undisputable evidence of facilitating the escape of Croation Fascist being Vatican policy. From [this link](http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/the_vatican.htm): 

&gt;Following the Nazi invasion and dismemberment of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Independent State of Croatia was established as a clerical-fascist state under the rule of the Croatian fascist party, the Ustashe. Some 700,000 Serbs, Jews, Romas and other anti-fascists were killed in the Jasenovac death-camp complex, while many more were killed in smaller camps or in local massacres. While the Ustashe regime set about to racially exterminate all Serbs, Jews and Romas living within its borders, it also carried out a systematic policy of plundering the assets of these three nationalities. These looted assets, the property of millions of people, were never recovered. The bulk of it was smuggled out of Croatia at the end of the war to the Vatican, and from there to still other destinations. 


&gt;the looting by the Nazi's of Europe's gold, including victims of the holocaust in Yugoslavia, and how the Swiss profited from it from banking it, and how they kept it safe for the nazi movement after the war by moving it to either Spain or Portugal and then on to countries such as Argentina. As The Observer noted on 7th December 1997:

    ""Some of the bullion went via the Vatican and the Iberian dictatorships to Latin America, the destination of choice for Nazis on the run""

A study commissioned by the Swiss government estimated that Swiss banks received about £2 billion in looted gold stolen from the mainly Jewish, Roma and Slavic victims of the Nazi holocaust (The Guardian December 5th 1997). The Papal State has come under heavy pressure to open it's archives. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) released a declassified letter from the US treasury which showed that in 1946, the Americans were told that:

    ""Money and gold stolen from the Jews and Serbs (in Yugoslavia) were sent to the Vatican"" (The Guardian, December 5th 1997).

And also:
&gt;In turn, the Vatican set up a ""smokescreen"", pretending to forward the gold to Franco's fascist regime in Spain, and then onto Argentina. Under the dictator Juan Peron and his wife Evita, Argentina became a safehaven for other escaped Nazi war criminals such as Klaus Barbie, Adolph Eichmann, and Joseph Mengele. (The Guardian, 23rd July 1997).

 &gt;The Vatican not only hoarded the gold the Croats looted, it also helped them escape - with a nod and wink from the OSS and MI6. In 1986 for example, the US government released documents that revealed the Vatican had organised Pavelic's safe-flight from Europe to Argentina, along with 200 senior officials of his regime. During their escape, they had hidden ""frequently in cloisters"" in Catholic churches and in many instances, had ""disguised themselves as Franciscan monks"", according to Vladimar Dedijer , writing in The Yugoslav Auschwitz (Ahriman-Verlag, Freiburg, Germany, 1988, p53).

First off, the thing that sticks out most in this picture is the train's white spot, and it goes right smack dab through the middle of the picture, which steals attention from the rest of the image. I'd have recommended an angle on the shot either a bit higher or a bit lower, and probably lower, just to really emphasize the perspective effect on the honeycomb.

Also, you really need to either have more people in the frame, or less. Having half a person in the frame not only is distracting, but gives the impression that you weren't sure if you wanted them in there - an overall lack of control on the shot. I do know how hard it is to keep people out of a shot, especially in a place like that, but a slight crop would definitely help.

You also might want to play with the color a bit. The DC metro is admittedly a pain, showcasing muted browns with subtly pukey green highlights. I'd recommend either toning it to add some color, or partially (green) removing it or even entirely desaturating it.","1293848104"

But consider this - if the skeleton of a trans man/woman was found by police and examined by a forensic scientist, they would check both the skeletal shape and do a DNA test, both of which would come back positive for whatever sex the person was born with.

"Military","t5_2qh8y","I am about to turn this netbook into a frisbee, as shitty new tab handling and the horrid touchpad have caused me to lose my reply to your post 3 times in a row now.  To reiterate, thanks for your reply, please forgive if I do not link sources, I am not willing to lose a 4th edit by switching tabs:

I do not think it is a good comparison to place an Iowa class battleship, with its &gt;30cm steel belt armor, next to a Royal Navy vessel from the early 1980s.  If you recall, one of the issues investigated by the Admiralty after the Falklands war was even warships' susceptibility to Exocets (crippled as they were) and iron bombs.  Argentine pilots regularly made low-level attack runs, thus not giving their gravity bombs' fuses enough time to arm, and still managed to shred large holes in several ships' sides just from dud impacts that would have bounced off better-armored vessels.

Yes, that would be defeated by proper armor-piercing weaponry, but that assumes a level of guidance and warhead sophistication that, while by no means out of the PLA's reach, brings in the issues of cost you correctly mention.

I appreciate the logic of this ""solution"", but I doubt whether it is anything more than a PR stunt to show overwhelming Chinese numerical superiority and willingness to engage (""look, we can put tanks on invasion barges"").  

First, I believe that the countermeasures to such an approach (I mentioned FAEs, among others) would be highly plausible even in the face of air superiority.  Tank artillery has an _effective range_ of maybe a kilometer.  I can't tell from the picture what vehicles those are, but I seriously doubt whether the Chinese would use first-line vehicles, like Type 88s and Type 96s with their superior (relatively) fire control systems as ersatz artillery.  So such vessels would have to close in pretty close, at which point they become _really_ vulnerable to conventional field artillery that is nowhere near as expensive as the weaponry you mention.  And the towed guns on the platform...maybe if you had several thousand of them you could just blanket the target, but that's one of the reasons I mentioned FAEs -- I wouldn't want to be an exposed crewman on one of those.

As for the RAND report, I am a bit doubtful for a number of reasons, which were better addressed in the comments than I can describe.  Fundamentally, it makes a few assumptions that I do not believe are valid about levels of operation-readiness, weapons selection, deployment and logistics, and equipment used, that I do not find realistic.  

I recall a recent article (Economist?  If you're interested I can dig it up when I'm back from holiday with access to a better machine that does not eat draft posts) describing how the Chinese military threat, at least at present, is vastly overrated, if only due to issues like (still) technological lack of capability -- the need to go buy advanced jet engines from the Russians being only one element of this.

To be honest, I think it's all a moot point, as I do not see China invading Taiwan.  I believe that this is posturing for the benefit of a domestic audience that is assertive and nationalistic, to show that ""look, we have tanks on boats, we _could_ invade Taiwan if we wanted to"".  China, I believe, knows that at least at present, a military assault on Taiwan would expose its fragile and vital overseas supply lines and resource operations to an intolerable degree.

I don't care what anyone says about the ""String of Pearls"" strategy, China simply does not have the force projection means to defend its economic reach overseas, and will not for a very long time.  It is also extremely vulnerable to closing of foreign markets, due to absence of sufficient domestic demand to pick up the slack.

Lastly, I am convinced that China's leadership understand that the last thing it wants to do right now is get involved in a shooting war over Taiwan.  Even were they to be capable of pulling off a tactical win (note that I am not discounting this at all, it'd just be really really costly and definitely not a sure thing, and it certainly would not be due to this sort of ""weaponry"") it'd be a pyrrhic victory in not just a non-military sense.  China of all countries has proven itself to be pretty astute in understanding multifaceted strategy and would not sacrifice other advantages for a military win.

In short, I still don't think this is in any way viable, nor is it likely to be used.","1293848226"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","You might think I'm engaging in hyperbole of course. Here's a snippet from the link:

&gt;So I told her bluntly that sex was out of the question and she had to go to sleep; that was the end of the story. Not so easy, she said, and, naked as she was, she turned around, put one knee over my belly, riding practically on me, and moved up towards my head, riding on my chest.... She was short and exceedingly fat, pound- ing on my chest, and I could hardly breathe. Then she demanded that I have oral sex with her, squatting over my face bringing her vagina to touch my mouth. There is nothing to it, she was saying, do it now! I couldn’t make it.... I had never done it in my life, and my situation, my attitude, her attitude, the awful smell, and the sweat or fluids—I don’t know—running into my mouth and I couldn’t breathe. I tried to free myself but it was impossible. She demanded it, and she wanted to have it....
Well, she realized that it wasn’t going to happen and that infu- riated her. When I vomited, spitting up the contents of my stomach on her, that was the end of it.... She started talking about me feel- ing disgust towards her, ... to make me vomit when I was close to her, ... and started abusing me. She slapped me several times on the face; she grabbed my testicles and was pulling me around, hit me on my buttocks, and punched me on the stomach.

We certainly are the fairer sex! BTW, I have done martial arts, knee-on-belly is unbelievably painful and should be considered a form of extreme battering. ","1293848235"

BTW I tried and failed completing college on my own (refused to take on massive debt) and decided to join the Air Force to get me back on track.  

Just completed my degree this year.  Not all service members agree with a lot of the situations they are put in.  Do not tread lightly though, it is a major lifestyle change.  Basic training will be difficult, after about 5 weeks it gets better and is over before you know it.  It isn't that physically demanding, it is more of a mental thing, and TI's use physical exhaustion to supplement the constant mental attacks.  The hard part (for me) was coming to grips that the military can and will own you for the time you are in.  Also....no matter how old you are you will generally be treated according to your rank.  I also found this out after joining later in life after already living on my own for a long time...and subsenquintly being treated like a teenager again in many situations.

I really think the Air Force is a good choice, just make sure you have a guaranteed career in a specialty you want.  You can learn valuable skills that carry on into the civilian sector as long as you are smart about it.  One nice thing about the military is in certain situations you will get a lot more responsibility put on your shoulders with less experience than any corporation would think of.  An example being, I was one of two Microsoft Exchange administrators (both military) for two networks of approx 2500 users and had only been in for two years at the time.  ","1293848328"

I have to say that studies on dolphins and whales communication is practically non-existent, because it is impossible to get any funding. US Navy funds nearly 75 % of worldwide bioacoustics research and they are only interested in understanding echolocation so they can use it too and hearing tests so they know how loud their sonar could be before it turns dolphins' brains into puree.

We care because your religion is harmful to people. Christianity causes people harm. This is a fact. Whether it's the Pope playing soft with pedophiles or telling people that condoms don't help against HIV/AIDS, or people voting to deny others basic rights because of their personal religious beliefs, the fact is that a lot of bad things happen because of religion. If all you guys did was believe your stuff and go on your way then no one would care so much. But Christian dogma permeates many societies. Governments make laws based on these beliefs. You may not do these things. But the organization(s) that represent your beliefs do. 

That's why people care. There are many of us who feel the world would be a much better place if Christianity wasn't around anymore.","1293848353"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Umm... ""this?"" I'm trying to convince you of the merits of Harris' ideas on morality, I guess.

On the basis of ""Harris morality"", I would argue that it certainly is immoral to have religiously mandated laws: The set of moral decisions you make based on the ""well-being"" standard differs from those made on the basis of religion; and if ""well-being"" is your standard then the shit that comes from the Bible, wherever it differs, is immoral; and where it agrees, is redundant.

Harris argues, for a whole chapter, that well-being is the *only* standard for morality that is relevant and makes any sense. This appealed strongly to me and I'm convinced. If you don't agree, I think you're still the victim of some muddled thinking. Of course, not having read the book also puts you at a bit of a disadvantage. I don't remember enough of his arguments to lay them out for you and -I'm sorry- I'm too lazy to quote mass quantities for you from the text.

The USA holds some positively medieval views on morality. I get the impression parts of USA are closer to the Middle Ages than modernity. 90% is hugely overstated, I say. I would put European countries at 80-90% and the US at maybe 50-60%. Huge swaths of public opinion in the USA hold that all legislation and morals should be Bible-based; they f-ing haven't even *heard* about any revolution!

I hope you're just kidding, otherwise I've been talking straight past you. Potential is *nothing*! Living, sentient humans have value; cells are just so much slime.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The race war occurred towards the end of the year. Something I haven't specified: this kids were only with me for about 3 months. Kids would come and go every day. The dynamics were always changing. The best example of this was a black kid called Brad. I had Brad for the 2nd nine weeks and I was pretty much the only one on campus who didn't think he was funny. This is mostly because I was pretty much the only male on campus. He would make lewd comments about the female staff and when they were around he would be sweet like he was trying to butter them up. As soon as they left, he reverted into his terrible self. He would walk around campus screaming ""PIPE! PIPE! PIPE PIPE PIPE!!!"" He had a small following but no one really disliked him. He was a pretty big kid, maybe 6'4 and 300 lbs. He was in a gang and often flaunted it. I wrote more referrals on Brad than any other kid. He would call me gay, walk out of class, put his feet on furniture, refuse to stop screaming, etc. 

Anyways, when he came back in the 4th nine weeks, things had changed. He use to rule the school and do whatever the fuck he wanted. When he came back, there were different gang leaders. One was the leader of a hispanic gang called Mike. He was a poor kid but me and him really got along since I tried to get him a job (couldn't do it). Either way, one day he came into class saying that he hadn't gotten any sleep and promptly put his head down. Brad started to scream, as always. Mike asked him politely about 5 times to be quiet. Brad refused. Mike got up, calmly. Walked over to the computer that brad was on. He said ""Are you gonna be quiet"" and Brad said ""Fuck you"". So Mike grabbed the keyboard and smacked Brad across the face with it. This was the start of the race war.","1293848371"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I don't know why you can't give me simple answers to simple questions. If there are so many books written, why can't you name one?

Here's an example: I'm familiar with the Christian God and there are many books on that subject. I'm sure most would agree the most popular of these is the King James Version of the Bible.

What you find in this book is an angry, vindictive, often sloppy deity that lays down vengeance on his creation in an arbitrary and unpredictable way. I know of no definition of ""perfect"" that would include such a thing.

This is why I'm interested in knowing what religion you adhere to since it does not match up with anything I know about the many that are out there.

You also keep side-stepping the question of how you'd know if you've met God, if you've had contact with them. How can I differentiate between an impostor, and the real thing? How can I be sure that I've had a genuine encounter?

If, for instance I came across someone claiming to be Jesus I could ask them questions, I could find out more about them, and it would quickly become obvious if they were telling the truth or not.

How can you be looking for something if you have no way of knowing if you've found it? You might be looking in the wrong place, you might be thinking about it the wrong way, or you might even not notice when the time comes because you've got the wrong impression of what that experience will be like.

I ask in all seriousness because people are far too frequently duped into believing someone is representing God. Perhaps it's this inability to articulate what this God figure is that leads to this unfortunate confusion.

You wouldn't buy anything without knowing how to tell the genuine article from a cheap imitation, so how can you not apply the same healthy skepticism in spiritual matters?","1293848387"

Imagine you write a very simple computer program. It outputs a series of 3px by 3px images. The pixels can either be coloured black or white. The computer takes a brute force approach and creates every possible image within those parameters.

Nothing too interesting right?

Ok well, lets take that same incredibly simple program, but scale it up massively. Lets say for the sake of example that we tell the program to generate 800x600px images, and instead of filling them with either black or white pixels, we give it a pallet of thousands of colours to choose from.

Ok now things get a little interesting.

The computer will try every conceivable combination of pixels, creating trillions upon trillions of images. Doesn't that mean that eventually the computer will draw a perfect portrait of you? A picture of your cat? A picture of you and your cat high fiving? A picture of you and your cat High fiving in space? Every famous painting in the history of art? Every famous painting in the history of art with moustaches added to the characters? The computer will create an image of EVERYTHING. IT. IS. POSSIBLE. TO. SEE!

Obviously there are two major problems that would arise if you tried this in real life. Firstly being that I doubt there is enough computer memory in the world to store all of the images the program would output. And secondly, the signal to noise ratio would be abyssmal, with trillions of pictures that are merely static fuzz.

But STILL, that doesn't change the fact that IN THEORY an absurdly simple computer program would be capable of creating an image of EVERYTHING a human being could ever see. EVERY IMAGE YOU COULD POSSIBLY EVER IMAGINE! What also blows my mind is the implication that there is therefore FINITE NUMBER of things you can see.

"badcompany2","t5_2rgyt","Simple math says why I love the Grach so much.

17 round clip @25 base damage with magnum ammo. In a good situation, that's a 4 shot kill no problem, even faster if you headshot with it, which isn't hard.

If you hit with every bullet, and you're at close enough range, in theory, you could take down FOUR GUYS before you have to reload.

Realistically, I can mow down 2 or 3 guys no problem without having to reload my trusty grach, and it spews lead as fast as I can click (which is pretty damn fast)

Honestly, I don't see the love for the 1911 at all, especially not when stacked against the Rex.

Rex is a 2-3 shot kill at all ranges (1 up close if you headshot!), and IMO has way better sites than the 1911's.

Rex can also in theory drop three people without having to reload at close range, or two people at longer range, both things the 1911 can't do, and you're really not sacrificing much in the way of ROF for choosing the Rex over the 1911, plus I've found that the 1911's higher firing rate is actually to its disadvantage, since you really need to make those shots count to have a chance at killing someone.

Actually, if you were really ridiculous (or an aimbotter) you could drop SIX people without having to reload the Rex you were somehow able to headshot them all at close range.

Overall though, grach is my favorite pistol simple because it's so versatile. Rex is GREAT for long range kills, which makes it an excellent shotgun buddy: at any range beyond one-shot slug range, one Rex shot will finish someone off faster than I can pump and try and line up my shotgun again, and if I'm rocking a semi-auto without slugs, Rex gives me a good chance to kill people at range.

Grach on the other hand, works well right up close if my rifle is out of ammo, or if I've just partially whiffed a 40 mil shotgun. IMO it's actually BETTER than most rifles up close since it does so much more damage, and still has a high enough ROF to keep up with them.","1293848458"

In fact, we're prohibited from using leashes while blasting or performing other AC work.  I find them to be a hinderance, time consuming, and a general pain.  If it comes to termination or the use of leashes, I will comply, but in the meantime, no leashes.

As an interesting aside, a few weeks ago a skier was hit in the teeth by a runaway tele ski.

All without invoking intrusive DRM. 

Valve had a major following before Steam so their fans already were on the bandwagon when Steam launched.  Even though it was rough in the beginning, Valve listened to customer complaints, acted accordingly, and in some cases, very quickly.

Valve is everything right in the PC gaming industry.  Why a company like Ubisoft would see what Valve is doing and go the complete opposite is a mystery.

I am not saying Valve is all glitter, unicorns and rainbows, but they are awfully close even for a PC gamer like me who likes to have the physical copy of a game.  I buy from Steam because it is just so damn easy and I want to support Valve.","1293848531"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I do not know of many undergraduate students who study archaeology and are very much older than me. However, there are plenty of older people who do not have PHDs or Masters in Anthropology and still take part in excavations quite regularly. Generally, any archaeological dig is going to appreciate volunteers regardless of age and frankly, aside from theory/history of archaeology classes, you can't learn a whole lot about archaeology without getting out there and doing it. One side effect of that is that plenty of people who get involved in digs can become damn good archaeologists, even if they never studied it in college. I know a few older individuals who have masters degrees and have no desire for PHDs. 

The internal archaeological programs in Jordan don't get a great deal of funding, there are only two universities in the country that have archaeology programs. Most of the work the department of antiquities performs centers around issuing permits to foreigners, and making sure that no looting takes place at sites around the country. So, in the case of Jordan at least, many archaeologists are essentially not Jordanian, even though the citizens of the country have plenty of pride in their history.

I don't know about the conditions in other countries very well. But I think rather than internal archaeological programs outcompeting foreign archaeologists, political issues are more likely to be inhibitive. For example, I am guessing that it would be much more difficult for an american school to get permission to excavate in Iran than it would be to get permission to excavate in Jordan.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Most ships captains are retired navy captains and commanders from foreign navies. I haven't met a US captain in years. You can always go the merchant marine route and go with the maritime academy. However, many of them end up going navy, either that or they get sick of working freighters at crap wages and go the Stevedore route. Either way, it's a long haul and few people actually make it. 

Once you do get on a ship, you can expect to work long ass shifts. Most captains more or less stay on the bridge 12 - 16 hours a day. If you drink you can forget it now as regulations regarding that are stricter. 

I am an ex navy officer. I was mostly shore based, but did a few cruises during my time. Life on board a ship is cramped. Food is usually good though. You'll find it worse in the maritime industry, though it is free, I think. 

I have heard of some people working up the ladder through the ferry industry. I think that's really slow, and hard to switch lanes once you are captaining a ferry.

It's not really a secret to getting past it. It's just being open with your partner, them to you, and learning to lean on each other and fall in love again and again with them as they change. 

&gt;I still love him and I want to be with him, but I keep fantasizing about going out with some guy I don't even know and just the type of hot sex you have with people on first dates.

And that's part of the issue to. That super sexy hot first date action? You can still get it now. Your window though, is closing, and very fast. It's hot and sexy because you're hot and sexy. The dynamic is going to change, a lot, very quickly in the next few years. The sexual dynamic with a thirty something bitter divorced dude and a woman with sagging tits and stretch marks isn't the same. Or anywhere as much fun. It sucks, but that's life. It's just a lot more fun when you're young and in the spring of your life. 

Really, I think the only actual advice is to not keep it bottled up. If you've been with the guy for five years, he should be someone you can confide with about everything. This included. A relationship should be about people working through problems, especially problems in the relationship, together. 

&gt;How do you still sexually fantasize about a guy who you've seen a skidmark on his boxer shorts? &gt;.&lt;

I formated and installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 Ultimate and started installing the drivers one by one, opening Youtube in Chrome in between each install and checking for any lag or audio skipping. 

I did this through all the drivers until I finally got to my LAN driver which turns out was causing all the problems for me. The Atheros LAN driver for my netbook was messing everything up but since I use wireless I just disabled that network connection and it had a similar effect as simply not installing it. 

I doubt we could have the same problem but since you're shooting in the dark I'd try that (first start with disabling it rather than uninstalling, of course this is all worthless if you're actually using LAN because when I plug my LAN in the lag problem goes away). 

If you haven't tried a fresh install I'd try doing that too since after my fresh install I noticed Chrome ran a lot faster but I was still having the audio problem.

How did the shave feel? Was the smoothly razor cutting or painfully pulling the hair? 
How long did you lather your soap? (10 seconds - not enough, 60 seconds - good) 
Be aware of the angle you're holding your razor at, it will greatly impact the razors performance. 


Otherwise, adjust your variables. Were you using a cartridge razor before? Was it working well for you? If so, try using your new soap/brush with it, you may not be getting a good lather and are having trouble as a result. 

Failing that, there's a good community in [/r/Wicked_Edge](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge) and a great community at [B&amp;B](http://www.badgerandblade.com/) keep with it, but don't abuse your skin. If a DE cuts you up, it may not be right for you. 
(Here's a tip for people new to DE/Safety razors and ""Wet Shaving"" if somebody is trying to convince you that Wet Shaving gives a better shave than fusion/mach3 question their advice... just like you should question mine. Wet shaving offers a great shave, no doubt. I can get an equally excellent shave from my cartridge razor though. It comes down to cost, style, preference and a whole slew of other things. You may find that you love using a cartridge razor with soap and a brush, that's cool too.)","1293848682"

If you still are, I used to have these crippling emotional struggles myself.  I lived on a Naval Base in Corpus Christi Texas and I was able to walk out on to these old World War II sea plan ramps and just cry and rage against the world for being so ridiculous and stupid as to not make me happy.

That makes it sound trite, but I assure you that at the time, it wasn't.  I wasn't the ""cool"" kid in school (this was in high school) and I was not exactly a teenage lothario with the ladies.  I felt like there wasn't ever going to be anything good in my life and the the universe was made of shit, and I was the only one who secretly understood this.

Time passes.  I am not that teenager any more.  I am 40, with a wife and 2 kids, and while life is not the rosy basket of skittle flavored sunshine that I would want it to be, in fact I am a stronger and tougher person than these little setbacks proved to be.

I don't know if you are a teenager or if you are 50, I am just telling you my story... but it sounds like you are plagued with a little too much self awareness like I was at 13.  I never really shared this darkness with my family, and I survived.  It could happen that you could do the same.  Or it could happen that you need to tell your Mom or your Dad that hey, life sucks and you are just wondering if shit gets any better when you get older.... If they are honest, be prepared for a difficult answer (the challenges are greater as you level up).

"westtoo","t5_2s7t6","I don't know if you're Tony himself or someone else, but regardless of who you are, you have a very wrong idea of who Anykey is as a person.

Wherestheanykey has spent countless hours helping myself, and many other members of the West Coast TOO community (including the server administrators themselves, LuckyStrikes and EhEmDe) with so many technical problems that it would be tough to list them all. 

But I'm going to try.

Back before TOO was even around, I was having some issues because I'm dual-booting Win7 and OSX on my Macbook Pro. I was running out of space on my Win7 partition because I had underestimated how into gaming I was going to get. Simply resizing a partition is not an option, so I had to clone the drive, delete the partition, and then re-partition the computer. But my drive had become fragmented, so I had to reformat my computer. But someone had thrown out my OSX Install disc, so I had to boot a friend's computer into target-disk mode and reformat that way. Coming to every conclusion in the last paragraph would have been nearly impossible for me to do on my own, and Anykey was with me the entire step of the way, suggesting and trying multiple solutions until we got one that worked.

A few days later, I decided I was going to give my mom an old-ish desktop I had laying around, but I wanted to install some version of Linux on it instead of Vista. I wanted Ubuntu Netbook Remix, but installing it on unsupported hardware led to all sorts of glitches with half of the GUI not showing up. I shit you not, Anykey spent a total of *at least* 15 hours over three nights helping me try and get it working, and when I gave up he was there to make sure that default Ubuntu got installed properly.

Those are the two most poignant personal stories that I've experienced with anykey, because they involved many moons and tons of reformats, restarts, and slammings of the keyboard in frustration. Anykey has never hesitated to hop on TeamViewer (a free, easy to use screensharing application) to help me fix any problem I might have, and he has done so too many times to count since those frustrating nights installing Ubuntu.

For example, I was trying to stream my gameplay of Amnesia: The Dark Descent on justin.tv, but no audio was coming through. Anykey zipped up a full version of VirtualAudioCable, hosted it on mediafire, and helped me set up 2 VACs and 3 repeaters so that I could merge my mic and game sound into one stream for my viewers, and it was a great success, thanks to him (as well as Unwind for gifting me the game and the other 20 people for watching).

Another member of TOO (Blank Smoke) has had some issues with his laptops being pretty defective, and though he hasn't related the entirety of the story to me, we discussed it briefly and he said that Anykey suggested various solutions to him, and despite Blank Smoke himself being fairly proficient with computers, he told me he was absolutely blown away by Anykey's amazing prowess, and was incredibly thankful for how much help he'd given him. Yet another member of our community (Olly, the guy who made this thread( was on the server when we had this discussion and said that he, too, was amazed by how great Anykey was with computers and how he was always offering to help and *always* knew the solution to the problem.

Anykey has even helped the server admins with problems in the past. If you've seen the tabbed Message of the Day that pops up with the HLStatsX and tabs for our subreddit and Google, then you've benefitted from Anykey. He whipped that up out of the blue when he heard people talking about wanting the MOTD to show our stats.

A while back, there were some issues some players on our server were having issues with the server rates causing lag spikes. Our administrators were confused as to how exactly to fix it, and with Anykey's wise advice they managed to solve the problem quickly. I wasn't entirely involved with it but I remember it had something to do with the minrate or maxrate not staying put.

Look at the steam names adjacent to our reddit usernames --  another task Anykey took upon himself simply because he knew how and could do it swiftly and effectively.

I'm done telling tales of how awesome he is, because that's more than enough proof. Anykey is a credit to team and a credit to TOO. With his knowledge, altruism, and frequent gaming hours he is, by far, the best candidate for a game admin that I have ever seen on this server, and him half-seriously suggesting people support his application for the position was entirely justified.

 I've played with Tony a few times and he didn't seem to be an enormous douche, but several other people have reported otherwise. I'm saying nothing of his (your? I'm still not sure who you are) character, but if you're going to insult one of the nicest members of our community, I'm not sure if there's a place for you here.","1293848700"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It's true. War is a for profit enterprise, a game of the rich for the rich and it's the poor and middle class that pays the price. 

Read what General Smedley Butler said a long time ago (He's the guy who ratted out the conspiracy to overthrow Roosebelt): 

""War is a racket"" 

Smedly Butler. 

WAR is a racket. It always has been.

It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.

A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small ""inside"" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.

In the World War [I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows.

How many of these war millionaires shouldered a rifle? How many of them dug a trench? How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat-infested dug-out? How many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights, ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets? How many of them parried a bayonet thrust of an enemy? How many of them were wounded or killed in battle?

Out of war nations acquire additional territory, if they are victorious. They just take it. This newly acquired territory promptly is exploited by the few – the selfsame few who wrung dollars out of blood in the war. The general public shoulders the bill.

And what is this bill?

This bill renders a horrible accounting. Newly placed gravestones. Mangled bodies. Shattered minds. Broken hearts and homes. Economic instability. Depression and all its attendant miseries. Back-breaking taxation for generations and generations.

For a great many years, as a soldier, I had a suspicion that war was a racket; not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it. Now that I see the international war clouds gathering, as they are today, I must face it and speak out.

I knew a guy whos cousins, uncles best friends dads ex-army buddy did cocaine but had no lungs to smoke, and he has been high ever since then, with a permanent erection. (Another side effect of cocaine)

What you're going to want to do is see if there is any styrofoam around your house. Empty your cup'o'noodles, get all your shipping supplies whatever you can muster up. You're also going to need a tent, and a pickle.

Step One: Place all the styrofoam in a pile.

Step Two: Build your tent around said pile. (If you have time on your hands, I would build this tent out of aluminum foil, I will provide science facts for why it is good later.)

Step Three: Enter tent and light styrofoam from THE BOTTOM.

The smoke will be thick and dark, thats good. Some uncommon knowledge is burning styrafoam helps take away niccotine/cigarette cravings while at the same time repairing/clearing your lungs of carcinogens. 

Stay inside until the aluminum foil is hot to the touch, once it is, sneak out of your tend and poke a hole in the top of it, and inhale all of the smoke you can, until your craving is gone!

If all of that fails, eat your pickle to help your oral fixation.

EDIT: No need to thank me, I know how tough it can be to quit smoking. I never smoked but one time I was eating a box of cookies and I was addicted to them but I didn't want to finish the whole box so I had to put them away.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I quit a while ago, but I'm deaf and raided top-tier content in vanilla, BC, and WotLK.

I was a healer, then tank, then dps (druids are awesome!). I lucked out by being in the same guild the entire time (the guild is still active so if I do decide to return, I can raid with them again). They require vent but waive it for me due to my deafness.

I would research the strat before the fight and double check with the RL or other melee (in WotLK) if there was anything special or different that I needed to do. Once in fight, someone would relay instructions to me if needed such as a brez or innervate request. Otherwise, I was fine with DBM cues .

It wasn't like I was being carried- I was often one of the top DPS and could be relied on to do a tricky role (demo driver in 4T FL and Illidan P2 flame tank for example)

It didn't really take a lot of effort from the rest of guild, just a bit of typing before the pull and possibly macros depending on the fight.

The worst part would be when they forgot to tell me about a change of strats or something and I'd do it the old way and die or yelled at :| 

It was amusing to see guildies try to raid without vent for a night saying that chacochaco does it all the time, it can't be that hard! then die repeatedly to AoEs since they didn't have RL telling them to run on vent h4h4h4

But seriously, the WoW devs do pretty well with making the game accessible- if there's a major sound cue in a fight, it's often broadcast in text too but if there's a visual cue too, they broadcast it for the people who can't look at their screen (Anub in Naxx's locust swarm in Naxx 40 vs Naxx 10/25, the cue for it was a little bow thing in 40m but they added a broadcast in Naxx 10/25) so basically anybody can play it and succeed.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Airport security is theater.

There are a million just as effective ways to drive a car full of explosives next to a crowd and kill people. 

That's the result of the effectiveness of suicide bombs; the bomber doesn't need to get away. 

Worrying, specifically about the security of airplanes, as to the extent of spending billions, private, or public, to contain a threat that simply will not be stopped: that's bullshit. Every would be bomber, was either already on the plane, or past the security checkpoints regardless.

The implementation of security scanners for example is just a useless pork jobs project. 

If you want real airport security; do it the Israeli way. Spend less, train more. Efficiency, over size (in terms of $).  
Moving to privatization does not mean efficiency will occur. Not to mention, you're placing what is typical the role of government (protection of it's citizens) into the hands of private companies. 
I don't really trust placing protecting people as a means to earn money. The end result is the same as health care; providers banking on letting the safety net drop. 

As for poking at Republicans; I'm simply stating the philosophy and approach of Republicans towards government. Most end up, if not already are, employed or have ties to businesses and corporations that they work to benefit. 
They also tend to push privatization under the guise of government inefficiencies; the ones which they created by overspending, and under utilizing. 

Democrats aren't as big into this hypocritical, anti democratic approach towards government.

The concept of the luminiferous aether was outright abandoned by most physicists over the course of a decade or two after the Michelson-Morley experiment, and this was during the time when the state of the art in fast long-range communication was the telegraph.

Point being, the reason why dark matter is still the mainstream explanation is that it's still the best supported by evidence, and not because the worldwide community of physicists is afraid of admitting they're wrong, as is vaguely intimated by the scientists in this article, and as is always outright stated in comments any time this discussion comes up on Reddit.","1293848807"

However, I must disagree that we have some sort of moral obligation to maximize the utility of nutrition.

From there, the different copies were made... the DCP (digital cinema copy) was cropped at 2048 x 872 I believe and the blu ray master was a crop aswell at 1920x1080... The reason for the cropping instead of scaling is to keep the sharpness of the image itself.

As for the TDK stuff, some WAS rendered at 8k... but majority... majority of it was rendered at 5k and above. Majority of the actual footage in TDK was not shot in IMAX resolution... you can clearly tell the different sections when watching the blu ray copy. as it switches aspect ratio between 2.35:1 (i think? or 2.39) and 16:9

Im not sure who came up with the 1920x1080 resolution... but hopefully it doesnt stay around for much longer. I think they should have gone straight to the film aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (1920 x 817)","1293848817"

So I'm getting *different* behaviour depending on whether I open the tab via context menu or RES. That should not be happening according to the FAQ:

I grew up in a closed communion denomination and I fully understand why they believed in closed communion.  They took communion seriously (as I do), and believed that no one should be taking it ""unworthily"".

That's a valid point, but the flaw is that in closed communion many, many, MANY people will be taking communion unworthily.  The test of ""you're in the right denomination"" is a very poor measure of someone's relation to Christ.  The larger the denomination is, the worse this is too.

People ARE going to be taking communion who shouldn't be.  Closed communion will not change this.  And closed communion increases division within the Church, (aka the body of Christ, aka all Christians), because rather than reaffirming that despite our differences we are all saved by Christ is reinforces feelings of ""you're not a true Christian like me"".

So I think we should have open communion.","1293848863"

In my opinion, an actual GIS degree should fall within *both* departments, and should include coursework from each discipline (especially in basic programming and database design/management).  GIS is really an IT field in this day and age, and you will need to be able to do more than enter data and make pretty maps if you ever want to your career to progress further than the Technician/Analyst level.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","The problem I have with what you are saying is the discussion about right treatment should be conducted fully within the medical profession. The concern is that worthless or harmful treatments should not be supported by anyone in the profession. If you have no sympathy for a patient who does not follow your advice and is harmed due to that, I think you need to do some more thinking. They did find a *doctor* who agreed with them. Ultimately it is that doctor's fault more than the gullible/uninformed patient. How are they supposed to know you are right and the other person is wrong? Even that doctor did not know what is right, or worse, he knew and is immoral.

A patient in need of medical help is not just a collection of physical symptoms; there is also their psychology, emotions, wrong views, etc. These also must be part of treatment. I realize there are few absolutes in medicine, but there are good statistics. Reasonable medical decisions can be made based on those stats. Truly gray areas can have more than one interpretation, but it gets sleazier and sleazier the closer you get to risky, harmful surgery being given when ""statistically more people do better with pain meds and therapy.""

I feel sorry for anyone who gets suckered into that and is harmed, and if there are doctors who do that repeatedly, they should lose their licenses.","1293848894"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","From the Free Legal Dictionary: 

&gt; harassment (either harris-meant or huh-rass-meant) n. the act of systematic and/or continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group, including threats and demands.  

The purposes may vary, including racial prejudice, personal malice, an attempt to force someone to quit a job or grant sexual favors, apply illegal pressure to collect a bill, or merely gain sadistic pleasure from making someone fearful or anxious. Such activities may be the basis for a lawsuit if due to discrimination based on race or sex, a violation on the statutory limitations on collection agencies, involve revenge by an ex-spouse, or be shown to be a form of blackmail (""I'll stop bothering you, if you'll go to bed with me""). 

The victim may file a petition for a ""stay away"" (restraining) order, intended to prevent contact by the offensive party. A systematic pattern of harassment by an employee against another worker may subject the employer to a lawsuit for failure to protect the worker.

That's a legal definition. I'm sure all universities have a harassment office, take it up with them. If you kept pestering someone for a date they could get the harassment office involved. I think your situation is analogous.

So the boy eventually found a job as a bell ringer for a church, and decided he should take it. The boy went to the church, and knocked on the door by banging his face into the door. The priest came out and the boy told him that he wanted the job as a bell ringer. The priest asked the boy how he would be able to ring a bell with no arms, and the boy told him he would find a way. So the boy climbs 20 flights of stairs to the top of the church and reaches the bell tower. The boy then got an idea, and he backed up, and charged full force at the bell, hitting it with his face, and ringing the bell. The priest was astonished at how the boy rang the bell, and gave him the job. The boy would then go to the church, climb up 20 flights of stairs, back up, run at the bell, and ring it with his face for 30 years. One day the boy went to the church to perform his duty, he backed up, ran at the bell, but missed. The boy went flying off the edge of the bell tower hitting the ground and killing him. A large crowd gathered after hearing the noise, and a man went to the boy and cradled him in his arms asking ""Does anyone know this boy?"". A voice from the crowd then said ""I don't know his name, but his face sure rings a bell!""","1293848981"

"science","t5_mouw","I think that saying the relationship F=ma at large enough distances is not linear, for gravity in particular, makes more sense than saying 75% of the universe is made up of stuff that we have never seen, with properties we know nothing about.

I think this because there is nothing special about F=ma. It is simply a relationship we observed, which fits some of the data we have.

But the universe is given, as in, if I want there to be dark mass in 23% of the space, dark energy in 72% of the space, and atoms constituting of only 4.6% of the universe, I better have damn good reason why that must true. And to me, General Relativity not predicting how things work is not reason good enough.

If it was true that only 4.6% of the universe is made up of the stuff we see, including our own solar system, we can easily find that the probability of not having a single piece of this new type of matter in our own stellar neighborhood would be extremely low. In fact, we'd be seeing it all around us. This is why, to me, dark matter does not make much sense and is not a simpler explanation than 'we got something wrong'.","1293848989"

I would dispute this statement. petas actions held no sway in my decision to become vegetarian (and eventually vegan) and neither did they in the swaps my other vegetarian friends made. my experience has shown that the kinds of things peta do, do not influence people in the direction they hope to. shocking people with videos of factory farms and things of that nature just don't work. emotion is not the right direction to go. if you try and go at someones beliefs relating to meat by way of emotion then you will always be defeated by their own emotional ties to their food. once someone has dug themselves in like that the only way to change their minds (aside from emotionally traumatizing them) is through reason and logic. i will admit they may help in planting the seed of the idea in minds but after that all they can do is harm. the problem is that they act in such a childish and silly manner and then all vegetarians are seen badly. its like how Muslims don't like to be represented by terrorists and reasonable conservatives don't like to be related to the nut jobs in the tea party.

The issues is that SHOUTcast servers respond with ICY 200 instead of HTTP 200 in their response.  The NPR client gets around this by using a proxy on the phone to connect to the SHOUTcast server.  The client tells MediaPlayer to connect to the proxy, which then connects to the SHOUTcast server, parses the response and replaces ICY with HTTP and sends it to back to MediaPlayer.  Then MediaPlayer won't freak out think it's not an HTTP stream.  From there, it's just straight passthrough.

Note: this problem is only for SHOUTcast.  Icecast, the open source implementation, responds with HTTP and is able to be played normally.

You can play an MP3 stream with no problems once you get past the connection.  Playing an AAC stream is another problem.","1293849045"

"energy","t5_2qhkd","Can you explain your issue with subsidies? Everyone is touting subsidies, but I would like to remind you that the issue with renewables, was not subsidies a few years ago, it was cost which is now going down every year.  
And what is the source of your belief that, why you think subsidies for renewable energy is bad (paleoliberalism  does not seem to explain that)? Unless you think renewable energy is bad by itself, which was never actually proven by anyone. It has some issues, but all of them are addressable.  
As I see subsidies result in increased research, development, growth and deployment (scaling) of this sector. And this sector really needs it, because there is no such thing as ""big wind"" or ""big solar"" yet, only ""big coal"", ""big oil"" and maybe ""big nuclear"". Subsidies will be gradually reduced and removed in 5-10 years in most developed nations because they will not be needed anymore. Renewable energy will become cost effective by itself. This is meant to be, because technology becomes cheaper and better as time goes by due to engineering improvements, manufacturing process optimization and market forces.  
While everyone is well aware of the shortcomings of each approach to renewable energy all of them can and will be overcome when they become blockers. None of them are right now.","1293849050"

"Military","t5_2qh8y","&gt; In her first naval fire support action of Desert Storm she shelled an Iraqi command and control bunker near the Saudi border, the first time her 16 in (410 mm) guns had been fired in combat since March 1953 off Korea.[30].....

&gt; .....in response to the battleship’s artillery strike, the Iraqis fired two HY-2 Silkworm missiles at the battleship, one of which missed,[31] while the other was intercepted by a GWS-30 Sea Dart missile launched from the British air defence destroyer HMS Gloucester[5] within 90 seconds and crashed into the sea roughly 700 yd (640 m) in front of Missouri.[32]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Missouri_%28BB-63%29

Although a heavily armed ship she does not have the defenses needed to fend off a missile attack. Think of the modern subsonic anti-ship missiles (Harpoon/Exocet/Silworm etc) like a modern Kamakazi type attack at speeds closer to an Me-262. Even if the attack does not sink the ship it will heavily damage them and incur what is basically a ""mission kill"". 

Take the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia for example:

&gt; a Mitsubishi Ki-51 of the 6th Flying Brigade, Imperial Japanese Army Air Force[16]) deliberately crashed into the foremast of the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia.[15] The attack killed 30 (including the cruiser's Captain, Emile Dechaineux) and wounded 64, including Australian force commander Commodore John Collins.[15]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Australia_%28D84%29

She was a heavily armored vessel not unlike a battleship, but she was taken out of the battle by an attack equivalent to a modern missile attack. This means that for very little investment the enemy can dictate what you bring to battle. 

There is also this case, which makes for an interesting read.

&gt; The resilience of well-armoured vessels was shown on May 4, just after 11:30, when there was a wave of suicide attacks against the BPF. One Japanese plane made a steep dive from ""a great height"" at the carrier HMS Formidable and was engaged by AA guns.[25] Although it was hit by gunfire, the kamikaze  crashed into the flight deck, making a crater 3 m (9.8 ft) long, 0.6 m (2 ft) wide and 0.6 m (2 ft) deep. A long steel splinter speared down, through the hangar deck and the main boiler room (where it ruptured a steam line), before coming to rest in a fuel tank near the aircraft park, where it started a major fire. Eight personnel were killed and 47 were wounded. One Corsair and 10 Avengers  were destroyed. However, the fires were gradually brought under control, and the crater in the deck was repaired with concrete and steel plate. By 17:00, Corsairs were able to land. 

But we must remember that the modern weapons, radar, and communications by definition are exposed and unarmored. Even the USS Missouri would have had to leave the combat area if it had been hit in 1991, because she had been modified for modern warfare by the addition missiles and communications, all exposed on her deck.

"science","t5_mouw","The universe's expansion is visibly accelerating, and given that the theories predict dark energy which would cause this, it only makes sense to assume that it really is the cause. There's a teensy little problem though; the amount of dark energy predicted by the relevant theories is ridiculously larger (as in, 10^120 times larger) than the amount of dark energy predicted by expansion.

As for how it works: as far as people believe, it doesn't really have a mechanism. The usual theory is that space by itself just has some intrinsic energy density. Since this means that expanding a given area of space results in higher energy, basic thermodynamics shows that you end up with a (negative) pressure, and this pressure accelerates the expansion process.","1293849071"

Mutliparty systems are not necessarily any more open to interest aggregation than two party systems, and the United States is *really fucking open* to interest aggregation. People who wish to argue this point are deluding themselves; the government encourages outside participation in policy creation, lobbying and advocacy are big business, partisan politics is alive and well, and fighting the government in court is as common (and effective) now as ever.

What is ""freedom""? Privacy? We're not the most spied upon democracy, that would be the UK. Civil freedoms like speech, religion, etc.? We have those, although we lack some (like gay marriage), but other free countries don't have the same civil rights protections we do (Germany, for example).

Apparently the proof is that there are cracks on the moon from where it was put back together. There are similarly ridiculous examples of science in the koran regarding electricity and human embryology.

The fundamental problem with saying that there is science in the koran is that science is a predictive method. These examples from the koran have absolutely no predictive value. Unless you've already got an electrical device on hand or a picture of the moon or a picture of the cat's eye nebula, the koran tells you absolutely nothing about how the world works.

I don't think the people here need to be convinced of the above, but I've found that coming up with an actual logical argument is much more productive than telling devout muslims that they're insanely wrong.","1293849149"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I lived in Cincinnati for many years so I feel like I should comment on this. First of all, Anderson cops are generally regarded as dickheads, especially during traffic stops. It doesn't surprise me at all that this occurred in Anderson. Secondly - and this doesn't excuse the officers behavior - I have seen diabetics in a low blood sugar state and they are often very much out of it, possibly belligerent, and have a hard time relating their condition due to their state of mind. In short, I'm not surprised that the officer thought the man was drunk. I imagine the man was pulled over and was having trouble rolling down his window or unlocking the door and that's why the officer smashed the window. I would be much more sympathetic if it ended there, but the use of the taser multiple times, further damaging property by cutting the seat belt, and then insisting on pressing charges once it became clear the man was diabetic is very far over the line and probably does implicate some racism. In short, what happened was unacceptable.  
  
Now a lot of people are saying that Cincinnati is an extremely racist city, and reading stories like this I can understand why people might feel that way. However, I think it is important to understand the dynamics of the city before jumping to such conclusions.  
  
This may not be a popular viewpoint, but it is the reality as far as I can tell. Cincinnati is historically a very non-racist city. It was known as the gateway to freedom because of its location at the end of the underground railroad. Escaped slaves came from all over the South and ended up in Cincinnati before (sometimes) moving elsewhere in the North. As such, there is a large Black population in the city.  
  
When the multitudes of blacks started moving to the city, they mostly began moving into the inner city, right outside of downtown. What were formerly working class white (mostly German first, second, and third generation immigrant neighborhoods), became predominantly black neighborhoods. This caused a great deal of ""white flight"" to newly built suburbs. White residents moved outside of neighborhoods like Over-the-Rhine, the West End, and Avondale, and into suburbs like Anderson Township (among many others). Thus, the dynamics of the city became such that the people with money moved to the suburbs and came downtown to work, while the people with no money (mostly the newly freed blacks), lived right outside of the downtown area in the much older and much more difficult to maintain neighborhoods of the 1800s.  
  
The result of all of this is that the black neighborhoods became very dilapidated and overrun with crime, while the suburban white neighborhoods became generally very calm and crime-free.   
  
Now the black neighborhoods should have improved over a couple generations, unfortunately working class jobs have been declining in Cincinnati for years. Factories have been closing left and right, which means that the poor and uneducated remain poor and uneducated, because there are no opportunities to make money as an unskilled laborer. Many people are working hard to provide good education for everyone, but once a couple generations feel like they've been abandoned by the system, it's almost impossible to get their kids to buy into the education that is being offered. As a result, many poor black kids are not being educated at all, because the only people they see in their communities that are successful are criminals. The honest worker is historically shat upon due to factory layoffs, and a college education becomes more and more of a pipe-dream  due to the downwardly spiraling education system. Thus, school has become nothing more than a place to go during the day, despite the teachers best efforts to teach.  
  
In essence, the white neighborhoods are doing just fine in the suburbs, while the black neighborhoods are hellholes in the inner city. This has resulted in resentment by blacks against whites and vice-versa. You would think it would have worked itself out by now, but the combination of the heavy influx of blacks to the city, plus the heavy outflow of whites once the factories started closing has resulted in an extremely segregated city - more so than probably any other US city. There was never any legislated segregation, but the circumstances sort of worked out that way anyway.    
   
As a result (and to tie this long ass post back into the story), many white people in the suburbs are at least somewhat racist, and the police forces probably reflect that. On the other hand, the majority of crime (whether it's a result of their situation or not) *is* committed by blacks in the city. However, this is one of the major issues in Cincinnati politics. People are working very hard to find solutions for the city. I don't think people from Cincinnati are inherently more racist than anyone else, but the situation in the city is clearly different from that of most cities in America. Please keep that in mind before passing judgment on Cincinnati, which is (despite its flaws) still easily the best city in the state of Ohio.","1293849185"

&gt; Just Chuck Mortimer was sitting at his desk working on what he was convinced was no longer an anthology of the world's hardest crossword puzzles circa 1951, but was instead a puzzle sent by an advanced alien civilization to reveal the secrets of the universe to those bold enough to discover it.   (Again, how I might choose to do it.)


&gt; He approached the problem of the anthology with a dedicated eye, a steady hand, an antique typewriter and a pessimistic three reams of paper. (Again, my edit.)


&gt; The puzzles had all been solved by mid May, a gift from his then wife and now angry litigious ex-wife was meant as an anniversary present for their 3oth back in January. (Can't make sense of this.  How solved?  Who solved?  If solved, why is he still working on it?) 


&gt; The scrawls of  in the margins of each puzzle were being carefully indexed and cataloged by a sharp click-and-clack upon the ancient typewriter and Charles Duncan Mortimer Malone aka Just Chuck was making progress to decoding the message at long last. (Again, this is dense and hard to follow.  Shorten the sentences, make yourself clear.  You don't get points for obtuseness.)


There's some talent here, but not much discipline.  He makes the newbie error of falling in love with the flow of his own words.  You don't want to do that.  Writing is as much about throwing stuff out as putting stuff in.  For that you have to develop an ear, especially for your own bullshit.

I use ctrl-1, ctrl-2 etc to command my pet. Particularly in cataclysm, pet control is going to be vital because of the amount of abilities that will kill our pets.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I refuse to work more than 60hrs/wk these days for more than a few weeks at a time. I worked 6-day weeks for over a year without a decent break. If it's a salary place, I'll work even fewer hours than that. Thing is, I get my shit done. I don't dork around online all day long. A lot of people do. They screw around online until maybe after lunch then put in crazy hours to get everything done for the day by say 9 or 10pm.

A friend of mine who was a supe on a very difficult show once told me ""I am not impressed by the guy sitting there till 3am getting his shots done. That shit is stupid. What impresses me is the guy who gets his shots done and goes home at 7pm to see his family.""

I do mostly hate the long hours but *why* I have to work the long hours is what pisses me off. Supervisors can't make up their minds. Producers want everything done yesterday so they can pocket bonuses for getting the project done early. Directors are clueless or don't care about that stupid little pop on frame 933. It's doing the same thing over and over again just to sit in dailies and have someone say ""well...yeah...uhm....let's try making it a bit more like this"" then the next day ""hmmm....no let's make it more like that"" and weeks go by and the final product looks almost exactly the same if not worse than where you started. It's such a waste of time and money. I can't tell you how many times I pulled an all-nighter just to show up in the morning and a supe or director changed their mind arbitrarily. That's what I can't stand more than anything. Movies could cost 1/4th of what they do if they were just planned properly and people's egos didn't get in the way.

We've started on a course of nurturing talent. Let's stay with that.

For the naysayers: remember that Arsene Wenger is probably the most respected talent scout in world football. If Arsenal are interested in a player then he is immediately of interest to other teams. Some other teams have unlimited funds. So we are effectively talent scouts for them unless we invest early. That's why we can't buy superstars.

Trying to compare a game like Serious Sam against Mirrors Edge is basically impossible because they're just Different Games.  This even applies to some extent to games in the same genre; I abso-fucking-lutely hated a bunch of VERY well reviewed AAA real time strategy games because they sucked at a high level of play.  Guess what; no major game reviewer is ever gonna have the time to get there on a single game, let alone one that's just been released.  In fact, there's a damn good chance that the field of play hasn't even evolved enough to be rated until significantly after release and could change severely with every patch.  

It's factors like that which differentiate really good games, and become far far far more important than # of bugs, graphical quality, or storyline quality.  To pull out factors like that you have to know the individual reviewer and understand what exactly he's rating in the review and how to read between the lines of what he's saying.  ","1293849261"

It involves India's top lawyers ,politician,police and social activists and a statement from Dr. Sen's wife.

Please hold on before thrashing Indian judicial system. There were some evidence about his involvement with Maoists. That may not suggest that he was waging a war against the nation , but the judge says he has acted upon those evidence . In the verdict sessions court judge has clearly said that he would have been more lenient had maoists(followers of mao-zedong) were not involved.

Please remember that very recently maoists had killed 76 Indian policemen in cold blood. There is a war going on between Indian government and Maoists.

Personally I feel Dr. Binayak Sen is not guilty. I think he doesn't believe in violence. He must have been cheated by Maoists and must have had some serious problem with Police officials of Chhatisgarh .","1293849282"

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","Others have said much of this but I see three aspects of this phenomenon (which apply whether it really exists or is just a misconception):

Being gay (or being a member of any other oppressed group) might:

 * give you the opportunity to understand the oppression of other groups more easily;

 * give you reason to participate in the oppression of others, as a way to try to get some of the privilege denies to you;

 * make others notice it more if you're a bigot.

The last point bothers me. The charge of hypocrisy is usually abusive, a way to smear someone you disagree with. In this context, it means holding members of oppressed classes to a higher standard of behavior than privileged people. How is that okay?

Granted, calling people out for their hypocrisy has a place; for me, that place is one-on-one conversation. Otherwise, IMO, it's not productive, but merely cathartic.","1293849283"

1) Note how when he's dangling near the top of the bridge there is never a shot that pans to show how far he is off of the ground.  Instead, they'll cut to a shot showing how far the ground is from that particular shot.

2) Note when he gets on top of the bridge and starts moving along it that you can actually see where the bridge ends less than a mile away in green grassland.  It's a hilly slope downward, too steep for a train, but not enough for a man.

3) The obvious conclusion is that he shot the parts dangling on the chain very near where the hill and bridge met, so that if he fell he'd not fall very far at all.  Then they shot him climbing up the bridge from further down.  They also shot the part with him running along the tracks around this same area to have a feel of continuity.

The part with the train?  He had maps, obviously.  They knew there was a traintrack there, that's why the headed for it in the first place (his 'exits from the wilderness' always strike me as the most obviously coreographed parts of the show).  They go down into a tunnel, wait for a train they know is coming, then act scared and run away.

Sad, really, that good camera work makes this all look far more dangerous than it remotely is.  The most danger Grylls was in the whole time was when he climbed up the bridge (and then back down again in a part they didn't show you).","1293849285"

It's one of maybe five non-sports games I've actually finished before I lost interest or became too frustrated. A lot of games' controls frustrate my old hands and failing reaction time, but once I got the hang of Mirror's Edge, all that the 1st-person leaping about became intoxicating, and I liked the relative simplicity of the controls (run, jump, slide). (I even went back to run some time trials after I finished, which, I might add, took me a lot longer than 45 minutes. Most chapters took me more time than that.)

So while I agree with you to some extent, I'm not entirely convinced that the capacity to suffer really requires such a high degree of intelligence. I think you would be hard-pressed to find a person who does not believe that a dog or a cat can suffer, but on the other hand, of course this is a difficult matter to prove.

Also, I agree that intelligence is relevant, but only so much as it helps define one's capacity to suffer. The capacity to suffer is still the relevant metric. Intelligence is merely coincidental. In other words, one would say, intelligent beings do not have a right not to suffer because they are intelligence; intelligent beings rather have a right not to suffer because they have such a capacity to suffer.","1293849292"

It was a much different perspective than the usual. I haven't been to any shows in quite a while because all the larger venues are a drive, or I just don't have the time.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The study you proposed to combat the WTH theory does not support your argument whatsoever. Did you read it?

Here's the conclusion from the abstract of your study:
""Our results confirm previous studies showing reduced fertility in overweight and obese women.""

Reduced fertility. Right. There. So you don't have a counter.


""So pretty much WTH evolutionary signal to men is thus: pick one that isn't too old or hormonally diseased to have children. That's it. Because pretty much all young women have normal WTH unless they have hormone problems (or are overweight or obese like you noted), it's unlikely that our OP had a freakish WTH given her normal range BMI.""

I'm glad you catch my drift. But there are ratios between ""EXTREMELY BAD"" and ""EXTREMELY GOOD"". Men can make choices about ratios in between the absolutes. And they do. While she may be healthy in the basic medical sense, it won't simply be up to snuff compared to a Victora Secret model. You can have two girls with identical BMI's, but look drastically different based on their body fat %.

Example: A girl with some basic musculature with a lower body fat % will look drastically better (she will look ""toned"") than a girl with virtually no musculature and a higher body fat % (which will have a worse WTH ratio). But both girls may have the same exact BMI, which in the BMI-sense, are equally healthy.


""(Note that ""gut"", your turn off, isn't really a part of the WTH in normal weight women. Abdominal fat usually attaches below the navel. Look where WTH is measured -- not in the gut zone.)""

Again, are you reading your links? Waist can be measured with a TAPE MEASURE around the stomach and torso (the area between the rib cage and hips). It's SHOWN in your picture. Excess fat, after hitting the preferential fat storage sites first, starts to occur in other body parts. This includes abdominal fat, that is in the abdominal region. NOT JUST BELOW THE NAVEL. Believe it or not, after it appears below the navel, it creeps upwards (and therefore affects the waist). That's why you DON'T see people with 2-pack solidly ripped abs and a pudgy belly right below that, fat distributes ABOVE the navel too.

""Abdominal fat usually attaches below the navel.""
Again, tremendously wrong in the case that fat distribution can occur upwards depending on the body fat % of the individual. How do you not know this?

Do you have a real link to a study showing your ""thin"", ""heavy"", ""emaciated"" women and their WTH ratios? Not only that, but presenting 3 outliers doesn't break the theory, or cast its effectiveness in doubt.

Finally, stop making absolute comparisons. There are healthy in-betweens to compare with! I never drifted from my original post, this still makes sense if you don't see in black and white.

I think the optimal levels of attraction (on a physical level) don't vary significantly between males. What may vary is how males will effectively ""settle"", either through their social ineptitude (insecurity around attractive women), or through cultural/family pressures.

Either way, I'm done here. You're reaching --- reaching too far out, and too ridiculously for me to even bear conversing further. You and your ""abdominal fat is usually below the navel ergo won't affect WTH"" mindset is simply a pain to argue with (are you trolling?).

However, no where in my comments did I state it was due to overt sexism. 

When you say that 'you don't find other women funny' - that is the root of the question. Why have you assumed my response was about an 'overarching systemic patriarchal oppression'? The phenomena in Blink is about gender, and how we may assign roles and make judgments based on those roles.

I was hoping that there was a program that I could only uninstall after a predetermined amount of time had passed. But if such a program doesn't exist, I would settle for something that was at least difficult to disable. Hopefully, in the time that I would need to disable the program, reason will prevail, and I'll be able to avoid temptation.

&gt;Self control exercise it or lose it!

It isn't that simple. When a drug addict wants to quit using drugs, they don't simply bootstrap will power into existence that allows them to rid themselves of their addiction. When they go to NA meetings, and tell other members how difficult is to be around their old friends, they aren't told by them, ""Self-control: exercise it or lose it!"" They're advised to cut off contact with their old friends, to avoid temptation. This is a useful strategy. By avoiding those temptations, they are less likely to slip up, and by forcing good habits upon themselves, over time, they develop the discipline to better avoid temptation.

In case, my problem is simple procrastination, which while not nearly as serious as drug, gambling, or food addiction, is still not something that can be overcome by trying to bootstrap will power into existence—an impossible feat. Instead, I need to avoid temptation until I can develop better habits and eventually better discipline.

Whenever I hear this ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" mentality, I realize how much better off we would all be if people realized that the concept of free will is a superstition.","1293849424"

In short, what I'm criticising is the tendency of the medical industry to maximise profit instead of the good of the patient. This applies both to ""traditional"" and ""alternative"" medicine.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","A paraphrased hadith (I'll have to look for its origins but it was narrated to me by Imam Idrees Zubair) for this situation:

Muhammad[](/pbuh) once came across Ayesha (RA) playing and asked her what she was playing with.  She showed him her doll riding on a horse with wings.  When Muhammad[](/pbuh) asked her what she was playing, she said her doll was riding on a flying horse.  When he asked her, ""horses fly?"", she said ""don't you know that Suleyman (AS) also had flying horses?"" to which he smiled.

This is Muhammad's [](/pbuh) tacit approval (or silent approval) of Ayesha's (RA) actions and it is a proof accepted by scholars that toys for children are accepted even in the shape of human and animal figures.

I've heard what Logicality said about faces too and believe it to be an accepted opinion.

Additionally, Gundam is neither human or animal... maybe it falls completely outside what is impermissible (because it is accepted that anything that is not explicitly haraam is permitted)?

As far as pictures are concerned, I recently asked this question and was told it is completely accepted.  It is not an attempt by man to recreate what God[](/swt) created.  It is only a capture of what is.  But I'm sure you could still find differening opinions :)

Three months later, they figured it out and charged my credit card the difference.  It sucked because I went from 0 APR for transferring 4k of debt to 13% APR for putting on a $3420 charge.

It's ridiculous that she can claim that she wasn't a big drinker. Normal drinkers don't *worry* that they won't be able to have a drink, fer chrissakes.

I drink something most days. Often I split a beer with my wife at dinner. I also like to have a scotch as a nightcap. Usually one or the other; sometimes both. If I'm in a bad mood or busy with work, I don't drink at all. If I'm working on a big project, I'll go a month without drinking without noticing. Also, I almost never get *drunk,* because I don't like it, and I hate hangovers (I got drunk for the first time in many years a few weeks ago, and it was fun, but the next morning I remembered why I stopped doing that years ago--it's not worth the wasted day following). I just like the taste and a mild sense of relaxation.

That is the behavior of a frequent, but not ""big"" drinker. I don't have a particular rule as to when I can start drinking during the day, and I think the existence of a rule is evidence of a problem in itself. I don't drink during the day because I have shit to do. Why would I drink? Also, if I drink, I can't drive at all (Japan's legal limit is... *Zero.* Any alcohol on your breath gets you a DUI.). 

I'm irritated by this person thinking she's this great teetotaler, even though she *totally* didn't have a problem--drinking all day, having more than 14 drinks a week, and driving drunk--which allows her to be holier than thou both as a drinker *and* as a non-drinker.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6"," Just wanted to say that I have a pretty decent grasp on how you feel.

 I saw in one of your other posts that you would like to stay in one place... Some 3D artists do make a living from working from home... You will have to rely on a lot of short-term contract work that way (so you are throwing away pretty much all stability) but I do know people who do it. I also started doing it recently, but I am probably only going to make 1/8th of what you do next year.

 Basically, I've been doing the same type of work as you for just two years... Well, five if you count the three years that I studied computer animation in college. The third year was actually the worst one (I had a mental breakdown because I was working on my reel so much that I wasn't sleeping for 48+ hours at a time and I was stalked by a guy who also currently works as a 3D artist... All the while I was going to class every day and being told that basically none of us were good enough, that nothing less than absolute perfection would get us anywhere, etc. The competition was unbelievable and I look back at my college days in complete horror. It was pretty much torture, but in the end it was torture that I chose to endure. That's youth for you)... After I graduated my brain was completely fried but somehow I pulled through. I don't want to say where I worked but I will say that it was in games (my life's dream!)... But, I quickly realized it wasn't worth it (the job was not very fulfilling. The worst part of it to me was watching the conceptual guys' work get stripped of all originality. They had some incredible ideas in-house but in the end the guys on top were too afraid to try anything new. Pretty typical story, really) and then quit, moved back home, took a part-time position (working from home making illustrations and animations for Facebook apps. The pay is surprisingly decent - $25/hour) and am starting an indie games company with a really talented coder that I have known for a long time. If I can't make that work then I'm probably going to do something else (no idea what though!).

 For anyone trying to get into this industry... For me personally trying to get into and then eventually working in this industry tended to feel like you are sacrificing your first born child on the night where there is a full moon and all of the planets align and then you swear to never breathe again, so you jump into a river and are swept away, and everyone you care about just watches as you are swept under the waves... Metaphorically speaking, of course... All just so that they will look at you the right way. This is coming from someone who still 10000000% *loves* doing the work. It's like when someone you love tells you that they love you back - when you have the attention of the right people just for doing what you love to do, or when people play a game that you worked on and they are enjoying themselves... The high you get is unbelievable... But it's also very painful in other ways.

 Anyway, I have to go work now. lol","1293849524"

I thought it was important for you to know that one of your contributors, Barrett Brown, has taken to posting on the social media site Reddit under his real name.  This would normally be of no consequence.  But I bring it to your attention because he seems to think that secretly recording his conversations with someone he doesn't like -- in which he himself calls the man a douchebag and a faggot -- is particularly praiseworthy, especially while repeatedly invoking his status as a writer for Vanity Fair.

The Logic Sniffer is great in terms of hardware performance but the software sucks compared to the ones available for the Mini Logic. The Mini Logic can even analyze USB.

Since these features already exist in other products, my opinion is that your best bet is to replicate as many of these features as possible while lowering the price, instead of adding new features. A lot of the work is in software anyways, if your software sucks, I won't buy your hardware, unless you can really hit that $16 price point.","1293849575"

I have quite a good visual memory-- I could probably tell you the cover the a book before I could tell you the author-- if I've read it.  This includes library books I've only read once. 

For instance, I can tell you battle royale is a red book with black on it.   The zombie survival guide is off-white.  Malcom Gladwell's books are white.  

When I look for a book, I scan it visually for my remembered image of the spine.  So if I were looking for battle royale, instead of scanning the whole fiction section for a red book and seeing if it's battle royale, I can scan the whole black section for a book with a bit of black on it, and it'll probably be battle royale.

Edit: The Wikipedia page for ""Eskimo"" confirms it, but it also says that it is considered offensive in Canada and Greenland.

&gt;Canada and Greenland[1][14][17][20] the term Eskimo is widely held to be pejorative[11][20] and has fallen out of favour, largely supplanted by the term Inuit. However, while Inuit describes all of the Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, that is not true in Alaska and Siberia.

Guess we are both half right. To be fair to OP, the image he linked to was subtitled using the term ""Eskimo"", and it would make no sense to call it an Inuit as it is from Siberia, which isn't a part of the Inuit's homeland.","1293849622"

I've asked my wife a couple times how she thinks she would feel if her mother went through with that kind of threat. She said that she has accepted it as likely that her mother would kill her self either quickly (e.g. overdose) or slowly (e.g. repeatedly ignoring her doctors' orders) but, ultimately, it would be the illness that kills her.

"science","t5_mouw","This is quite subjective. There are two reasons for why we differentiate between different species, not because of their intelligence but because of what level of ""civilization"" (whatever that is at a specific moment) we expect from them:

* Aspect of justification: We think more intelligent beings are more able to make more conscious decisions, the modern justice system is essentially based on this. Negative actions by less intelligent beings are seen as more likely being caused by blind instincts, they are *bad* actions and frowned upon by master morality for being an insult to our perceived superiority; negative actions by more intelligent beings are seen as more likely to be done in cold blood, they are *evil* actions and frowned upon by slave morality for being contrary to the social norms we subscribe to.

* Aspect of impact: A negative action against a member of a group (culture, species, etc) we can better relate to is a more maddening negative action against our perceived self. Social species who commit negative acts commit these more likely against their own species, and intelligence, playfulness, curiosity, language use and cuteness make dolphins extremely relatable to us.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I agree with basically everything you said.  I also went with just parens for function calls.  It just seemed too busy to overload multiple characters to mean the same thing.  Similarly I think tuples/records may benefit from using same parens as well.  This conflicts with the JSON approach of [] and {}, but it has always been good whitespace that makes those clear.  I'm not sure if they need to be different.  What do you think?  Certainly for function calls parens are sufficient as they can only be one or the other.

I found for properties that I often want to overload only the setter or the getter, but not both.  In fact the most useful properties are often ones with only a getter that is abstract and just shows data in a different manner.  I think of them as *virtual* properties, but I realize this conflicts with some keywords in other languages.     

I hadn't heard of the Universal Access Principle.  It seems right on, though I am sad at how many different ways us programmers have of saying the same things.  I wish there was mandatory refactoring for knowledge.  

&gt; f(age: age, name: getName())

I see your point that literals are great with named parameters and variables often duplicate this information.  If anything Objective-C has this the worst as they choose amazingly long names for everything. 

*Warning, thus begins rant about Objective-C*

    NSString *myString = @""This"";
    NSString *myConcatString = [myString stringByAppendingString:@"" is just a test""];

And that is using literals!  So painful!  I have heard some of this style comes from smalltalk but I haven't learned that one yet so I hope it is a much better language. 

While we are on the subject, I find it absurd that objective c managed to use named parameters but failed to let you specify them in any order.  Not to mention that it is ridiculous that they force you to define a variable name in addition to the named part of the function:

     -(void) prettyPrintId: (int) id andName: (NSString*) strName{...}

As opposed to this:

    function prettyPrint(id int, name String){...}


Clearly *id* and *strName* are unnecessary!  Yes, I know forcing order makes it sound like a pretty sentence, but it is still unforgivable=).  

*End of rant about Objective-C.*
(Sorry about that!)

Ok, back to talking about why named parameters are better.  Your point about variables duplicating this information is well said.  My reasoning is that it is the next abstraction level where you need the names again!  For example:  

    var personMeasure  = Database.Query(Person == ""Measure"");     // Type returned is ""Person""

it is my belief that this variable should work on several kinds of functions.  The obvious ones are:

    f(Person p);
    f(IPerson p);

But the new powerful ones that I'm theorizing will use a duck-typing approach to parameters.  If Person is defined to have properties age and name like in our previous example then there is no reason this shouldn't work on this:

    f(Number age, String name)

This is sort of like the record equivalent of javascript's *apply*.  The powerful thing here is you can make functions that are very abstract but are very easy to use for programmers.  The interface of f(head, tail) gives me the shivers.  It is so simple, and yet would work on so many things in this system.  

(In a sense this is like property pattern matching for objects at the function level... but that is too big perhaps to think about all at once)

Now I'm not sure that these these functions should automatically bind this way.  It seem for multiple parameters it would be hard to specify what is breaking apart or not.  One idea would be to have a burst operator:  Here it is with ""...""

    f(personMeasure...)

But my *broader thought* is that only once constructs have names is it possible to put in these new abstractions and conveniences.  The names enable more ideas for higher level reasoning, and that is the bigger point.  Ordered parameters give you javascripts apply, this is much deeper, where the same local variable can be used in several different functions as is.  

As it stands, local variables are so terribly limiting. We are programmers, why would we enter our own data when the cloud / databases will have it far more up to date for us?  Sort and filter and compound for us?  This implies programmers will mostly be dealing with lists of records.  And in this new world of records named parameters are just a better fit.

Combine the two and you are still 5 times more likely to die from lightning.

Don't know the situation but sounds like you were not being ""real"".  No real person should ""generally accept blame"".  A real person would fight back when he feels in his heart that he is not to blame.

&gt;She expected me to ""be more of a man"" and she did not want to have to decide where we ate, what we did, or anything else, really.

A real person decides where to eat, what to do, etc. equally with significant other.  If a real person wanted to do something, he would do it with or without her, because he really wants to do it.  He doesn't depend on her to do something.

&gt;My biggest problem is she was planning to leave for over a month, but never told me WE were in trouble

Don't take it too personally.  Women tend to think for awhile about breaking up a long-term relationship before they actually do.  That's why you should just move on and be ""real"" in your next relationship.  Considering she's been thinking about this for awhile, there's nothing you can do or say in a few hours that will over come her month-long thinking.  Better just to save your time, write her off, learn from your mistakes, and move on.","1293849808"

He says ""Sir, I'm homeless, I really could use some money for a nice meal and a place to stay... but I'm not looking for a handout,  I'm quite handy, I'll do any type of work for a few bucks.""
 
I think about it a bit, and recall that my wife has been busting my ass for weeks to do some painting.  This just might be the perfect opportunity.

I tell the guy... I think I have something for you.  I'll give you $50 if you paint my fence and the porch... All the brushes, paint and supplies are in the shed out back...  Should only take an hour or so, what do you say?

He is very happy and says he'll get right on it.   I smile at my good fortune and go back to reading reddit.
 

Well not more than an hour later,  I hear another knock at the front door, so I go to see what's up.

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","There are two people in the world that hammockchair really wants you to hate:  me and Julian Assange.

Julian she hates because she's pretty sure he raped a couple girls in Sweden.  I honestly haven't been following any of it and can't say yay or nay.  What weirds me out is that the half of the time on Reddit she *isn't* chasing anybody saying positive things about Julian Assange, she spends chasing around people saying positive things about *me.*

It started [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/en19z/its_shit_like_this_females/c19db5x?context=2)  The deleted account, as you can see, went back and forth with me a few times.  We started out by her calling me a shallow sexist.  When I asked her to explain that, she called me a shallow sexist defending rape.  As you can see, this is about the point where /r/twoxchromosomes decided to involve themselves because, you see, I want all women barefoot and pregnant and that little zinger

 -  ""*Our sexual mentality, on the other hand, is grab &amp; fuck. Not to put too fine a point on it, but a half dozen generations ago you bitches were de-facto property. If we wanted in your pantaloons we'd fucking ask your dad, not you. So next time you get all catty and bitchy about shit, remember that* **we're** *dealing with* **our** *instincts in* **your** *world and try not to be too fucking complicated about it*""

`(emphasis added)`

was construed to mean ""I wish things were in the old days back when you were my property.""

Life would have moved on except for the fact that the author of the deleted comment [wrote me the next day.](http://i.imgur.com/SoDTM.png) the TL;DR of her initial message was ""golly gee - I sure did have fun debating with you"" and the TL;DR of my response was ""piss up a rope you antagonistic bitch.""

Things would have ended there except for the fact that I tripped across a post in /r/all/new in which the author of the deleted comment laid bare her horrific experiences about rape and how Reddit is a terrible place that condones rape.  I looked at her history and discovered that she'd spent the whole of her time on Reddit since our exchange laying bare her horrific experiences about rape and bemoaning what a terrible place Reddit is.

[So I wrote this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/eojbb/consequences/c19p8dn)

As I've said before, I spent more time writing that than I spent writing [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/b2yfk/request_help_with_my_speech_to_the_judge_who_has/c0kp0zi)

Rather than choosing to ""debate"" me like she wanted, the poster ragequit.

Hammockchair, who hadn't interacted with me at all and had interacted with the deleted account a small amount, decided I was a horrific monster for using the phrase ""money shot"" and has spent the ensuing couple weeks reminding everyone what a horrible person I am.

That is, when she's not reminding everyone what a horrible person Julian Assange is.

&gt;  The oft-heard statement that male homosexuals were called faggots in reference to their being burned at the stake is an etymological urban legend. Burning was sometimes a punishment meted out to homosexuals in Christian Europe (on the suggestion of the Biblical fate of Sodom and Gomorrah), but in England, where parliament had made homosexuality a capital offense in 1533, hanging was the method prescribed. Any use of faggot in connection with public executions had long become an English historical obscurity by the time the word began to be used for ""male homosexual"" in 20th century American slang, whereas the contemptuous slang word for ""woman"" (and the other possible sources or influences listed here) was in active use.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Metallica with Queensryche opening sometime around 1988-89 (...And Justice for All tour.) It was a big arena show and I foolishly paid for front row seats. Everything was mellow during Queensryche, but prior to Metallica coming out everyone rushed the front. I was squished painfully against the metal fence and could barely breathe. A huge skinhead dude behind me pulled me up and out of that position by my head, pushing me back over his shoulder on top of the crowd. I sunk down in between people, struggling to get upright. One leg became entangled in a folding chair and I was stuck for a while. No one tried to help me. Metallica began playing and I was getting kicked and stepped on. I thought I was going to be killed; trampled to death. Some space opened up eventually, allowing me to get to my feet and stagger away. The rest of the night I felt very weak, on the verge of passing out. I was bruised all over the next day.

 It was a shitty show as well. Loud to the point that it was just a wall of noise.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","As an American who had never been outside the the U.S. before, the first thing that struck me in Israel was just the sheer ancient-ness of the place. I spent most of my time in Israel within the old city of Jerusalem. Me and a friend of mine found a rather cheap hostel there. Seeing buildings that were built, repurposed, partially torn down and reconstructed by Jews, Romans, Arabs and on down the line was absolutely fascinating for someone whose only real experience of antiquity was seeing a church that was perhaps three or four hundred years old. 

One of my most striking experiences was standing at the base of the West Wall. There was a area under an archway along the wall which is only accessible by men. There were a few plexiglass pieces of flooring through which you could look down to the ORIGINAL base of the wall which is many, many meters further down than you'd think. 
Again, you can scarcely go anywhere without confronting something archaeological. If you dig a hole anywhere, you'll probably find pottery (this would probably be illegal). 
The only site I saw in the Palestinian territories was at Hebron, but it was under the control of Israelis. I think one of the weaknesses of archaeology is that it can be too easily used for propaganda, and this one was being very overtly used for that purpose. Hebron has been one of the more contested cities. There is a rather new Jewish settlement there and a billboard at the margin of the archaeological site was very explicitly saying essentially that the land belonged to the Israelis of today because x and y demonstrated that the Jewish presence at this site was z years old. 
Its funny you mentioned tunnels though, me and my friend found one in the old city that we were probably not meant to explore but we did anyway (hey, the gate was broken). It was awesome.

"greed","t5_2qxhv","Fiji Water is horrid for what they (and the regime they collaborate with) do to the people of Fiji. While the fresh water of Fiji is being bottled up by a foreign corporation and sold abroad, these are the conditions the people of Fiji find themselves in: 

&gt; Rakiraki (a town in Fiji) has experienced the full range of Fiji's water problems—crumbling pipes, a lack of adequate wells, dysfunctional or flooded water treatment plants, and droughts that are expected to get worse with climate change. Half the country has at times relied on emergency water supplies, with rations as low as four gallons a week per family; dirty water has led to outbreaks of typhoid and parasitic infections. Patients have reportedly had to cart their own water to hospitals, and schoolchildren complain about their pipes spewing shells, leaves, and frogs. Some Fijians have taken to smashing open fire hydrants and bribing water truck drivers for a regular supply.

As for how this sad situation happened: 

&gt; In the early 1990s, Gilmour (David Gilmour, the founder of Fiji Water) got wind of a study done by the Fijian government and aid organizations that indicated an enormous aquifer, estimated at more than 17 miles long, near the main island's north coast. He obtained a 99-year lease on land atop the aquifer, brought a former Fijian environment minister on board, and launched an international marketing blitz inviting consumers to sample water preserved since ""before the Industrial Revolution."" To this day, Fiji Water has nearly exclusive access to the aquifer; the notoriously corrupt and chronically broke government has not been able to come up with the money or infrastructure to tap the water for its people.
