As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all. Your actions not only affect yourself and your partners, but also those you care about, the ones that will have to care for you all, and everyone for that matter. Be safe.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I'm sorry, but I have to chuckle at the idea that you can't do criticism without some sort of special credential.

The problem doesn't have much to do with the qualifications of the people writing as the structures and incentives.  Game publications live and die off of hype and exclusive interviews and previews.  Giving big-budget, highly-anticipated games negative or unenthusiastic reviews 1) makes fans angry because you're killing the hype (look how apoplectic people went over a 7/10 score for RDR2, for instance) 2) sours your relationship with game publishers whose cooperation you need for exclusive content.  And simply put, there just isn't that big an audience for a general-interest publication that's going to review games months late and be a wet blanket about them.  Gamers want to be hyped up and they want to play the big games at the same time everyone else is playing and talking about them.

I also disagree with your idea that reviews shouldn't be subjective.  What's the point then?  Of course a review should fairly describe the game mechanics and so on, but it's an opinion piece.  If it's well done you should be able to tell whether you'd like it, even if your conclusion is different from the reviewer's.  But trying to turn it into an encyclopedia entry is silly.",1614556800

"Adelaide","t5_2r1ca","I think you need to deal with this through one or more of the following:

1. Reporting this 'blacklisting' to Fair Work Australia: [https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/our-role/enforcing-the-legislation/workplace-investigations](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/our-role/enforcing-the-legislation/workplace-investigations)
2. Get people who are being targeted to join a union and seek help from the union about what to do (this is literally the point of trade unions).  Looks like that might be the Hospitality Workers Union: [https://www.unitedworkers.org.au/hospitality-workers-union/](https://www.unitedworkers.org.au/hospitality-workers-union/) although you should be aware that often more than one union will cover the same sector.
3. Talk to a lawyer about the defamation angle.  You would be surprised how easy it is to succeed in a defamation claim.  Plenty of lawyers would be happy to speak to you about your options.  Make sure you screenshot everything you can as potential evidence.
4. To the extent there are issues like family members details being posted on line, report it to the police ASAP and don't allow them to brush you off.
5. Raise this with politicians at the Council, State Government and Federal Government levels.  Don't go for the 'community' politicians, try to find people with a track record of standing up for members of the public in relation to these issues.  I'd suggest starting with phoning the office of your local members at the State and Federal level and asking for a meeting.

Not magically my point is that rather than a strait up annexation attempt one would see local pro unification given their support among the people who really matter in Taiwan the army. You don't really need major support long term to hold power in Taiwan, just enough till the PLA can land.  Once it's war or war they might want to sell Taiwan for a protected status in a special administrative region.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","This one?  The one where he says he forcefully opposed the Uygher camps and says there will be repercussions for that policy?  

&gt;COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about human rights abuses in China?

&gt;BIDEN: The Uyghurs.

&gt;We must speak up for human rights. It's who we are. We can't -- my comment to him was -- and I know him well, and he knows me well. We're -- a two-hour conversation.

&gt;COOPER: You talked about this to him?

&gt;BIDEN: I talked about this too.

&gt;And that's not so much refugee, but I talked about it. I said, look -- Chinese leaders, if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been the time China when has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven't been unified at home.

&gt;So, the central -- to vastly overstate it, the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that. I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China, and Taiwan, trying to end the One-China policy by making it forceful, I said -- by the way, he said he gets it.

&gt;Culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow. But my point was that, when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president and he was the vice president -- and that's how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu -- not a joke -- his predecessor, President Hu, and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another, because he was going to the president.

&gt;And I came back and said, they're going to end their one-child policy, because they're so xenophobic, they won't let anybody else in. And more people are retired than working. How can they sustain economic growth when more people are retired?

&gt;COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just -- is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?

&gt;BIDEN: Well, there will be repercussions for China. And he knows that.

&gt;What I'm doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude. China is trying very hard to become the world leader and to get that moniker. And to be able to do that, they have to gain the confidence of other countries.

&gt;And as long as they're engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it's going to be hard for them to do that.

&gt;But it's more much more complicated than that. I'm -- I shouldn't try to talk China policy in 10 minutes on television here.

"LoveIslandAus","t5_jstfi","Hmmmm Tayla didn't manipulate anybody, she told Cassidy very early on how she felt, Grant pretty much played the two against eachother. I know he was feeding her lies but it was objectively weird for Cassidy to latch on to Grant from day 1 and ignore ALL the obvious red flags (Tayla had a crush very early on but didn't even get a chance to get to know him since they shut other ppl off from day dot). It was also extremely weird to bring it up weeks later as a form of pay back against Tayla when this fling had lasted 3 days and she originally matched up with Grant to teach him a lesson for saying she was 'playing a game'.
 Also, kissing and hugging right after might have been insensitive, but it was clear, there was a lot of pent up sexual tension and again, it had been a few days of grant and cass getting to know each other goddammit, not a full on relationship style betrayal (obvs I agree he was slimey and totally lied to her, which was a big part of the problem).",1614556802

"investing","t5_2qhhq","I use Ally for a saving account and wanted to do more than that. I also had their credit card, which closed not long ago.

They have a fundemental leadership problem. Their products aren't tied together well; your credit card and saving account and business and car loan won't be on the same account. Every one of them are separate. They focus on making new solutions for them, but they're not really solutions customers will find easy to use.

Sure online banking is the hot new thing, but it's already taken off with Square and others. Ally is behind, and will remain behind for as long as their HQ is in Detroit.

"ich_iel","t5_37k29","Das trifft momentan viel zu stark aufs Herz.  
Das eigentlich Schlimme ist ja folgendes Gedankenspiel:  


\- Aktuell bundesweit steigende Inzidenz trotz aller Schutzma√ünahmen

\- Diese bewiesenerma√üen verursacht durch einen dominant werdenden Anteil an Mutationsvarianten ([Letzter Stand √ºber 20%](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/video/spahn-corona-schnelltests-100.html), und das ist bereits fast 2 Wochen her)

\- Wir haben aktuell mehrere Hotspots mit einer [dominant werdenden Mutation](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/zdf-mittagsmagazin/videos/corona-deutschland-britische-mutation-100.html), bei der die Ma√ünahmen nicht wirklich greifen und die Inzidenzien √ºber 150, 200, teilweise 250 liegen  
\-&gt; Nicht schwer vorzustellen, dass das der Standard wird, wenn Lockerungen greifen

\- Wir sehen, wie andere L√§nder (Spanien, Portugal, Gro√übrittanien) extreme Spikes von Inzidenzien von √ºber 600 gehabt haben, aufgrund von Lockerungen und Mutationen

\- Wir reden jetzt √ºber l√§nderweite/bundesweite Lockerungen 

\---

\--&gt; Wenn wir die Kurven in Spanien und Portugal betrachen, sehen wir, dass die Infektionskurven sich nicht langsam angehoben haben, sondern [unglaublich rapide](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/portugal?country=~PRT) angestiegen sind. In Portugal hat sich die Zahl der Infizierten in 4 Wochen verf√ºnffacht, in Spanien vervierfacht. In Tschechien ist grade die h√∂chste Inzidenz der Welt, was (deutlich auf Inzidenzkarten zu sehen) auch in den Grenzkreisen zu uns hin√ºberschwappt.

\----&gt; Aufgrund des zweiw√∂chigen Verzuges an Testergebnissen liegen die Zahlen logischerweise momentan deutlich h√∂her, als die Statistiken sagen. Da wir es mit einer greifenden Mutation zu tun haben, die potentiell zu einem exponentiellen Anstieg f√ºhrt (oder schon gef√ºhrt hat) und die Inzidenzen scheinbar sehr anf√§llig auf das Verhalten der Leute reagieren, f√ºhrt in der aktuellen (aufw√§rtstrendenden) Situation auch nur jede Bemerkung von Lockerungen nahezu zwangsl√§ufig zu einer Steigerung von Zahlen.

\----------&gt; Jede Steigerung von Zahlen erleichtert es logischerweise, neue Hotspots im exponentiellen Anstieg zu schaffen. Da wir immer einen zweiw√∂chigen Verzug in den Zahlen und einen zus√§tzlich zweiw√∂chigen Verzug in den Ma√ünahmen haben, dauert es mindestens 4, eher 5 oder 6 Wochen, bis sich ein exponentieller Anstieg brechen l√§sst.

Wenn wir auch nur die Zahlen vom niedrigsten 7-Tage-Stand der letzten Wochen nehmen ([7.089](https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/medizin/coronavirus-infizierte-genesene-tote-alle-live-daten-a-242d71d5-554b-47b6-969a-cd920e8821f1)) und eine √§hnliche Kurve anwenden wie in den umliegenden L√§ndern (4x bis 5x in 4 Wochen), landen wir bei einem maximalen Spike von 28k bis 35k als Durchschnitt. Also nochmal h√∂her als die zweite Welle.

Ich finde, es ist seit gut zwei Wochen so ein Gef√ºhl, als ob man mit vollem Tempo versucht, gegen eine Wand zu fahren, und ich habe keine Ahnung, was das bringen soll. Lockerungen jetzt m√ºssen doch im Endeffekt sowieso wieder aufgehoben und noch versch√§rft zur√ºckgenommen werden...",1614556803

"JETProgramme","t5_2w9xe","It seems like we're having two related but different conversations here. I'm talking about variants and the motivation to close borders to prevent the variant from getting in (the stated reason why borders were closed back in December), while you're talking about general prevention. 

It's important that data should reasonably inform border policy. With the strict restrictions in place (2 negative tests + 2 week quarantine)  a reasonable question to ask is whether those precautionary measures are effective. We ultimately don't have the data to tell either way so it's pointless to argue this point back and forth. Border closures will obviously generally slow spread, but its also possible to to limit border travel to small groups of eligible people with acceptable risk by appropriate precautionary measures so long as they are effective. And again, since we don't have that data, it's pointless to argue about it.

I'm not so much focused on whether olympians should be allowed entry not. My point is how olympians are being allowed entry. If entry, variants, and local numbers are a concern, it doesn't make sense for olympians traveling from all around the world to be exempt from quarantine now does it?",1614556804

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

Self-preservation: doing something to protect yourself or to survive. 

Selfishness: doing something that benefits you, at a cost to other people. 

Self-preservation is not always selfish, but it can be. If you've seen the movie Titanic, the villain of the movie (Rose's fiance), trying to survive the sinking of the ship, grabs a child on the deck and pretends that the child is his, so that he can get in a lifeboat, even though there are people who need to be saved more quickly than him.

**It gets better. Like, a lot better.**

To reach the peak of this series, we'll probably need to wait for a S3 unless they go the 2-cour route. However, the main issues that people have with this series (Spineless MC, trashy harem, etc.) are getting fixed this season. They don't get *completely* fixed, but their development actually happens (some of it, quite a bit actually). The only issue that is persistent is the deadbeat pacing of the series: When it airs, I'd recommend waiting for the run to finish and then binging it. It'll be difficult to enjoy otherwise imho (coming from a weekly consuming manga reader).

Otherwise, the show is setup to blindside you if you only thought of it as nothing more than self-insert wish-fulfillment MC who's trashy and now has a bunch of girls fawning over him. I highly recommend you at least try it out when it airs and make your own opinion of it.

Instant nutrition, and the genes of the surviving cells continues. Also those free floating genes can get picked up by other cells, of the same genus or not.

Think about if your neighbor gets eaten by a bear in the woods. You're going to run the other way so fast if you hear them screaming like that... It would save your life. Those instincts get reinforced.

Also there's something about how auditory signals are hardwired into the brain. You can react more quickly to sounds than you can to things you see, so it wouldn't surprise me if the lizard part of your brain is setting off all the alarm bells its can before you can even see the problem.

&gt;You could make the same argument for age/race/specie, as in ''refer to me as a 2 year old asian cat"" and see where that takes us.

You actually can't, but I get what you're saying. I'm just illustrating how easy it is not to throw a fit, rather than offering a slam dunk argument in favor of pronoun flexibility (which I am in favor of, in the interest of transparency). 

But you have a birthday, and a certain amount of time has passed since then. Your age is just a fact. The same is true for species, as the process of speciation is an established fact. Like the label of what species you are is not really up for interpretation in any ambiguous way. 

Race is similar, if not a bit more flexible. Maybe I'm about to burn bridges with some of the proper liberals, but at a certain point defining someone as being one race vs  another becomes kind of arbitrary in itself. Like it's a fact that you had parents, and they had parents, and so on, and they came from a specific part of the world. That's traceable. But in some ways the lines we draw between ourselves don't really have as much ultimate significance as we sometimes think they do. Now, I don't think it's acceptable for someone to just decide, ""I identify as a race which I am evidently not"", if only *because* of how much value we place in our heritage, and because the definition of race is so firmly glued to lineage, which itself is simply another unambiguous fact which is not open to interpretation. 

But gender is different. Beyond a flawed high school understanding, there simply isn't a genetic argument to draw a line in the sand to say ""there are two, and this is how we draw the line"". That's the entire purpose of the original post haha. And beyond that, we have traditions and expectations. The reason some people question the gender that was placed on them is simply because these traditions aren't always a good thing for every person in every situation. Even the obsession with genitals falls apart really quickly, since people are just born with different configurations sometimes. And if someone damages or loses theirs...we would never say that they lost their gender. So clearly their presence itself isn't the determining factor. What really is? 

Anyway, hope this doesn't rattle the nest, just sharing some honest thoughts. I'm not the gender police, everyone is free to have their own opinion on the matter",1614556809

The Dwarves and Drow are both from the Underdark, and they have a direct rivalry because the dwarves keep accidentally mining into drow territories and drow keep trying to claim the artificial caverns of dwarvish mines.

Elves have Italian accents, and Elven is almost a direc translation of Italian. I decided on this because the PHB mentions that humans sprinkle bits of other languages into Common, directly referencing Orc swears and Elven musical expressions. Since English uses Italian musical expressions, I just went ""good enough."" Except for some words, which I made up as replacements mainly for the naming conventions. Those words are present as synonyms, and rarely used in a context other than names.

There is no God of Death. Death is just a thing that happens. However, there is a pantheon of Death gods, lead by Motreap the Psychopomp. The other members are the gods are mainly patrons of each of the afterlives, plus an Elven god of Rebirth.

Because there are eight Gods of the Hells, each of them only count as 1/8 of a vote in the Court of Death. This is a major point of contention for them, and they argue that they should be worth a full vote each.

Motreap, as the head of the pantheon, is able to veto any decision, but usually doesn't because he has so much to do during any given night that it's just not worth the energy.",1614556810

&gt; Now if he touched someone inappropriately or did something bad like that? 

One of the allegations is that he kissed a woman on her lips against her will.

&gt; People get offended and take things personally at times when there is no intent to do so from the other person.

Your intent is not what's important in harassment allegations. It can be a mitigating factor, but it's not the deciding factor for a reason - otherwise the ""I was just joking"" or ""I thought s/he wanted it"" excuses would just always win out because intent is very difficult to prove. 

This does not seem like a situation of smoke without fire. It doesn't necessarily mean his behavior was egregiously bad, but at the least it's worth investigating and if some of the allegations are true (such as kissing against the woman's will) he does need to be removed from office.

Dunbine could have been masterful, but I will have to content myself with a show that is merely good. I‚Äôve discussed why it‚Äôs been let down already, and I‚Äôm sure you all know it as well, so I‚Äôll skip that for now. I‚Äôve already spoken a lot about this show generally in my [WT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/d5j198/wt_aura_battler_dunbine_animes_inventive_first/) of it, so I‚Äôm going to try not to repeat myself *too* much.

At the heart of Dunbine is a cautionary tale about the dynamics of power in its many forms. Everything in the show is motivated by the possession and use of power, which despite Drake‚Äôs simplistic view of it at the start of the show proves inaccurate, as the manner in which his own threatening power motivates varied and nuanced actions from those opposed and surrounding him. Even once everything gets up-ended after the move to Upper Earth the nature of these power dynamics remains prominently on the forefront of the story. The way this theme is interwoven into so many facets of the narrative is quite impressive and lends the work incredible thematic cohesion. From this come forth topics such as the tribulations of righteousness, the dangers of advanced technology, the double-edged nature of motivations, sacrifice, and the effects of one‚Äôs attachments among others. 

This theme of power results in quite the fascinating characterization for several characters, from Show who struggles with living up to the expectations he poses for himself and strives to be heroic ‚Äînot in the sense that he wants to be a hero, but that he strives to do things which would place him in such a category‚Äî but finds himself repeatedly short of living up to that, and as a result finds himself ever the more willing to risk first himself and later others as the situation grows more desperate, in order to accomplish their goals, which ultimately results in his death. This struggle towards ‚Äòheroism‚Äô is all the more poignant because it‚Äôs nestled within the show‚Äôs strong anti-escapist message, which I‚Äôll get more into later. Marvel follows a near identical arc, with the distinction that she loses heart more easily while being more in control of herself. Their shared arc makes them perfectly complementary throughout the narrative and makes their romantic feelings for one another all the more interesting on top of the myriad factors affecting their circumstances. Elmelie also has a strong, if underutilized arc, where her rebellion against her family‚Äôs tyranny begins with as open and straightforward opposition as she can manage, until the situations she finds herself in begin to force her to be shrewder, until she finally ends up manipulating her father and attempt to assassinate her mother in displays of subterfuge and underhanded methods, in a fashion that mirrors but feels distinct from the overarching narrative‚Äôs shifting moral boundaries.

I also appreciate how this show rails against the common element of escapism and the power fantasy that is invoked by several fantasy and mecha stories, confronting us with the likely outcomes of these circumstances and showing that treating the premise as a means of wish fulfillment leads to negative outcomes. It also uses its Isekai premise more creatively than most series even today; I can‚Äôt think of more than a handful of examples that have done better.

The series looks really nice most of the time. I adore Kogawa‚Äôs character designs and the artstyle is beautiful. There‚Äôs a lot of impressive and captivating visuals throughout the show, but by virtue of being a long-running show with less budget than its contemporaries it can‚Äôt help but dip every so often.

The last arc is undoubtedly a mess, with less than a handful standout episodes and with a lot of it feeling woefully repetitive and like the plot didn‚Äôt move an inch. The lack of progress for the main characters can be a narrative tool, as the show displays in its earlier portions where the heroes were met with repeated failures for almost a full cour, but during that the plot was still marching on in the background, not to mention actual worldbuilding and scheming going on back then. Earlier portions in the show have their issues ‚Äîsome episodes are unnecessary and that stretch of episodes after Elmelie escapes drags pretty bad‚Äî but the Upper Earth section takes the cake, and I have no idea how audiences preferred it over the actual fantasy sections. The arc also derails so many character arcs that could have had far better integration, such as Neal‚Äôs struggles with being a proper leader, Jacoba Aon‚Äôs change of heart and subsequent transportation of the battlers to Upper Earth, wherever Keen‚Äôs character arc was intended to go, and the political maneuvering that was hinted at from Ciela and the other countries. It‚Äôs such a shame the series had to spin its wheels and ultimately end on a low note.

Nevertheless, I still like the series on the whole, particularly as I seem to occupy myself with concerns over thematics more than most, but it is undoubtedly flawed. I frankly expected this Rewatch to sour my opinion on the show, the awful pacing and different nature of the last arc still ripe on my mind, but surprisingly enough I don‚Äôt think any less of the show. A rough journey it was, but it is one I nonetheless treasure and look back upon most fondly still. **7/10**

Thanks a lot for partaking in this Rewatch with me, everyone!

**Next Rewatch Shilling**

Despite my better judgement I have decided to host another Rewatch for a fantasy series, but thankfully this one is a mere two episodes. The media in question is the 1996 *Fire Emblem* OVA, which is an adaptation of the 1994 video game *Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazou*. You can blame u/Shimmering-Sky for this, since she put the idea of hosting an April fools Rewatch in my head and the OVA happened to be on my mind around that time. In any case it‚Äôs more or less the opposite of this Rewatch, a short experiment as opposed to a fifty-episode Behemoth.",1614556810

I don't like that he's disingenuous about his sources but straight up posing as an accessory maker is kinda douchey even if he's a nice guy.

Edit: It also explicitly peeves me that he's probably made a few grand at least off his hustle. It's not much of a consolation seeing as it's the bare min, but at least the products he resells reportedly work.

"Hololive","t5_29numb","There is a fine line to walk as a streamer, yes your primary concern is the stream itself and entertaining but you also have a responsibility to moderate and guide your chat. The difference is that often that responsibility is through asking folks to calm down or to ask them to stop doing something since you can't always perform mod actions yourself as you'd be spending the entire stream with that.

A lot of the problem here isn't that they don't moderate enough, it's that they lack enough help from a mod team to help curb the problem children if chat starts to take things too far.

Yes, the community needs to take responsibility for their actions but the talents do share part of the blame, though that blame is reduced by the fact that they do ask people to stop doing it. Thinking that a talent isn't responsible for what their chat evolves into is pretty narrow, you as the streamer can and do shape your community and chat as you see fit. Unfortunately, due to the size of the audiences we're now at a point where it's very difficult if not nearly impossible to curb certain behaviors without large mod teams dedicated to helping nudge people away from problematic behaviors.",1614556810

"Undertale","t5_2xdht","&gt;Also, Frisk only 'smiles as he runs' from enemies when he does a complete pacifist run. 

Sans makes it sound like Frisk has done this before, and why shouldn't it apply to all situations where Frisk runs away? This is not the path of a pacifist. This is the path of the neutral. The only difference is that you don't kill, and Frisk remains 'true to himself' without any influence from anything.

&gt;Chara's lines of impatience in new home are mostly after you've already Genocided damn near the entire underground, in an area that Chara knows is close to the end of the underground. They grow impatient over the course of genociding everything.

And this is the only path where Chara leads to some kind of ending personally. It is obvious that his impatience is not caused by your murders, but by the fact that he has something to strive for. And he is impatient throughout the genocide.

&gt;The 'shortened' messages are slightly shortened, but that's just as easily to help meta worldbuild the feeling of playing as a player that only wants to grind on enemies and doesn't care about the storyline.

It doesn't matter.

&gt;Would she be willing to secretly tell you she likes you via check while openly (where other monsters might hear) acting mean towards you with every other comment she makes? Maybe. Would she be willing to secretly give you a check message and then audibly refute it? That seems weird.

&gt;But if Chara's been getting check messages from monsters directly, why's Tsunderplane's check so weird? 

Because it doesn't always come from monsters, but it's not particularly rare that we can say that the information probably comes from them. There are many cases where information can't come from monsters, but there are also cases that can't come from Chara alone. Why should there be only two extremes?

&gt;Chara knows Loox's last name,

Which Loox could have said itself.

&gt;They know why snowdrake fights,

Do you think that the teenager was alive at the time when was alive Chara?

Undyne, who is older than this monster, doesn't know Toriel, and asks Asgore that this is his ex. Papyrus also doesn't know Toriel or what she looks like. Undyne also never saw humans. It's been a very long time. And if think logically, Chara was here also may not know about him. It's impossible for so little time to pass. Toriel even says that it's been a very long time since the last human fell before Frisk, but how long has it been in ALL that time? Even more.

&gt;Aaron's got horsepower and knowledge of his magic bullet patterns, &amp; Chara knows the name of Knight Knight's weapon to name a few. All of these are pretty random pieces of info for monsters to tell you themselves in the heat of battle.

I see no reason for them not to give this information. Because monsters are rarely the ones who take battle very seriously, especially considering that through this battle, they can often just manifest themselves rather than fight for real. A lot of monsters have to do with the sentimental part. So they can easily do it. And this is more likely than thinking that a child who died, perhaps hundreds of years ago, knows the personal information of many monsters. And WHY would Chara say that information in this situation (except about bullet patterns)? The same question.",1614556811

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","&gt;My understanding is that it is the seller's responsibility to get the item delivered to the buyer address, whatever they provide. It is up to the buyer to make sure that it is a secure location. 

I'd argue a package being left on an insecure doorstep isn't it ""being delivered"". But covid has caused a lot of faff when it comes to deliveries so it's a pretty weird situation right now. 

It really depends on the specifics. Did the courier even try to get an answer? Were there specific delivery instructions they either listened to or ignored? 

From a buyers point of view, if I buy something and it is ""delivered"" to my doorstep but I'm not notified of it right away (doorbell, phone call, whatever) and then it gets stolen, I am complaining to the seller that I never got the delivery.

&gt;You have proof of delivery, after that it is the buyer's responsibility

And if that proof of delivery is false? (Not faked by the seller, but the courier falsified saying they delivered it when they did nothing of the sort).

&gt;Stolen? Perhaps, but I have no control on that.

Neither does the buyer. And as the seller you are the one who is contacting the courier to actually deliver the item and if they fail to do so that should be your responsibility (just as if it gets lost during shipping).",1614556812

It's a little bit different if your daughters haven't seen your son in his birthday suit / he hasn't seen them since he was a baby and it'd make everyone uncomfortable. 

IMO it's about comfort level of the rest of the family.  If your daughters are on board and okay with it, then support your son's plan and let him do birthday in his birthday suit.  Being naked is only inappropriate if you make it inappropriate.",1614556812

I can tell what kind of timing you were aiming for in your old version, but it didn‚Äôt communicate the arc of the swing, so it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily read as a horizontal swing. Great job on figuring that out! One last suggestion though would be to maybe tool around with how you‚Äôre animating the body in relation to the swing. Currently the motion of the body is very much directly overlapped with the swing, that compared with the liberal amount of motion blue make it feel more spasm-y than a controlled strike. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for that‚Äôs good, but nevertheless usually I‚Äôd say to be targeted in what‚Äôs motion blurred and to break up different body motions and stagger them slightly (I.e. start with the lower body propelling the swing, then head follows behind slightly)",1614556813

The goal of every Vet Center is to provide a broad range of counseling, outreach, referral, and assessment services, collectively called readjustment counseling services, to facilitate high-quality post-war readjustment and reintegration. Readjustment counseling services at a Vet Center allow war Veterans a satisfying post-war readjustment to civilian life and provide active-duty Servicemembers a confidential resource for post-war assistance. Military families also receive no-cost marriage and family therapy and supportive services for military-related issues. Vet Centers provide bereavement counseling to surviving parents, spouses, partners, children, and siblings of Servicemembers, which include federally activated Reserve and National Guard personnel, who die of any cause while on military active-duty. Vet Centers provide confidential military sexual trauma counseling to all military Veterans and active-duty Servicemembers, to include federally activated Reserve and National Guard personnel, no matter their duty location, era of service, or whether the trauma incident was reported to authorities.

There time in grade and ‚Äòtis. Time in grade is NOT GUARANTEED. You can have a really crappy time making cutting scores to get promoted. So you aren‚Äôt guaranteed to make corporal or Sgt as fast or slow as you think. 

You can get punished or just pure cutting score Luck and get all the time in the world for Sgt and marsoc... or get meritorious promotion in any rank below and get fucked on Sgt time and grade for marsoc.  So just get that out of your head. 

Marsoc a and s is only 21 days(of a slay fest). So getting to ITC IF YOU MAKE IT PAST A&amp;S is really short lived in some form or fashion. 

If you want to be a shooter you might not want to be a linguist. Those are pretty demanding jobs.
You will be very constrained to your contract.   u/TapTheForwardAssist can better comment on that 

Also MARSOC guys in ITC will end up receiving some language schooling. Food for throughout. 

Waivers exist for everything by the way....

Let‚Äôs do the math... you get there possibly after your contract reenlist. That‚Äôs 60months??? 5 years intel? Not 100% sure NOT my mos.  you would be sent after your first contract if this is the case. TIS for Sgt is 48 which is 4 years. TIG is 1 year from corporal. NOT guaranteed you will get it. You still have years with uncertainty of promotion or punishments( not likely).  The 12 months til you released from 5 year contract, from the after you make Sgt if you get it ON THE DAY you are eligible (EXTREMELY UNLIKELY), should not be pressing for the 6months rest of the AFTER you reenlist as a Sgt. That should be 18months after Sgt.",1614556813

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","&gt;If dust wasn't that volatile, why did they go through so much trouble to keep it from hitting the ground? 

Because if it *did* happen to go off, the entire mine is toast along with everyone inside.

&gt;With the SDC controlling everything with a tight grip nothing else can  really pop up. 

Yes, that's a thing rich people do. If their industry would be threatened by something, no matter how humanitarian or eco-friendly it was, they'll do their best to interfere in it's development.

But I doubt the SDC is the reason why there's no notable alternative energy to Dust. Because Dust is still widely available, effective and efficient.

&gt;I'm pretty sure they're also responsible for turning  Vacuo into a desolate wasteland by draining all its resources. 

If I recall the WoR right, that was done by the other Kingdoms as far back as the Great War if not earlier. Meaning before the SDC.

&gt;However they're also huntsmen, trained to use dust efficiently in combat since they were children 

With people like Weiss, Glynda and Pyrrha, that makes sense. With people like Yang, Nora and Neon, who literally fight by bashing their Dustful weapons in your face over and over (and Yang also uses hers to block), the logic fails somewhat. 

&gt;and unless they force miners to access aura (highly unlikely) 

Civilians in Remnant don't seem to ever bother unlocking their Aura unless they go to a combat school. Ren only managed to unlock his by sheer dumb luck. 

Considering the multiple benefits of having Aura unlocked (at the very least, less likely to be injured), and how it can be unlocked manually, it seems unbelievably stupid in a world where most of the land is covered by monsters and villages seem to be taken down regularly.

&gt;Then again they also brand their workers/slaves, the SDC  doesn't give a shit

We only have 1 example of that though, and it's an unexplained one. It also makes no sense at all, because Jacques is obsessed with the public reputation of the Schnees and the SDC, he cares about the reputation far more than he cares about the money. 

A guy walking around with his company logo branded on his face is a PR nightmare, and it'd be completely out of character for Jacques to allow such a thing.

&gt;this is the one time she's been known to the world and planned out major  assaults against the kingdoms like bringing down Beacon and now going  after Atlas 

No. Atlas is her actually making herself known and assaulting a Kingdom. Every other instance so far was done from behind the scenes via her henchmen. 

With Beacon, Cinder spent months setting things up to rise the tension and unrest, causing much negativity to build up a Grimm horde, while also using Watts's virus to hack the Atlesian robots and create even more chaos, on top of getting the Maiden power. All when the world would watch due to the Vytal Festival happening in Vale, in fact she made sure to spark the fall of Beacon with Pyrrha killing Penny in the stadium right in the finals.

All of that behind the scenes instead of being done openly, partially enabled by Oz's refusal to do anything.

And then with Haven, they had the Headmaster on their side who could make sure the staff and students would be away by the time they came to get the Relic, while Hazel was elsewhere killing off the pro Huntsmen in Mistral. If it wasn't for Menagerie, no one would even know what happened there.",1614556814

I work with a guy who calls for a player to be dropped every time they make a mistake. One of those 'Sack them all and play the u21s' mentality fans. 

He thinks Lindelof is our worst ever CB and Maguire 2nd worst. We are currently second in the table. He says Bailly should play every single game, when I mentioned Eric can't stay fit for a month he just shrugged and said something about buying two new CBs. 

Hes also been saying DDG is finished for years, I feel like sometimes I'm the only one with a memory older than 6 months who remembers Dave carrying the goals against column seemingly by himself for a long fucking time.

Something NATO has to neutralize  first in any operations if they want to have some secure space. Being  detected a bit slower might increase the succesrate of anti air defense  operations while limiting own losses.

I'm not saying it's not useful. Just that it does not make you completely invisible.

&gt;Maybe a mass drone attack would be more usefull though considering the  cost of stealth planes. Or land based systems although that‚Äôs another  type of armament NATO has in short supply ( unlike Russia).

Maybe. But realistically, Kaliningrad is only 100km wide at most. You can easily take out what you need with guided 155mm and rocket artillery if you need to. Granted we don't have as many of these as I would like but the Poles are the exception on that front. They have plenty of both tube and rocket artillery and they are modernising.

But otherwise I agree. And NATO overall lacks tactical ballistic missiles the likes of the LORA or Iskander. The US have some, as do the Greek but otherwise nothing.",1614556815

"CenturyOfBlood","t5_233se6","Erich nodded, motioning for his son to follow as they walked. Pearse was not here to add much, but it was good to see all these different places at the very least. He had only really seen his own grandfather‚Äôs solar before, and all seemed to follow the same principles. Notable as the Lord‚Äôs solar, but not overly grand. Lord Swann‚Äôs solar followed that same idea, it seemed.

The two sat, and Pearse drank after the food taster had finished and left. Erich had found drinking was not something to encourage himself to do in his older age, so he abstained mostly. Regardless, as the rest of the servants left he nodded.

‚ÄúWe appreciate the hospitality. I think Pearse here was keen to follow you up on your offer back at Storm‚Äôs End. Though first, I hoped, now that we were out of Storm‚Äôs End, we could speak more frankly. I think it was clear you and I share opinions on the folly of this war. Your younger brother, Stannis, made some good suggestions. However, while I do not know the Darklyn‚Äôs well, I question if they would help us against their own countrymen. If they do not, the King has his eyes set on the Reach. Your father mentioned it during the council, but I have kin and connections to Peake and Ashford, my most immediate neighbours. I have no intention on marching on the lands of my own allies and relatives. Which causes issue, if the King does call on my house‚Äù, explained Lord Caron. ‚ÄúAs I said, I would much prefer preparing defences from the south then attacking my northern allies. Your house does not have the connections by marriage that mine does to these houses, but your father mentioned wards and squires. I assume you and yours agree there is little to be gained from attacking the Reach?‚Äù",1614556816

They just got to .500 yesterday and tied for 4th place compared to the dead last pistons. The concern for this game, is that they played yesterday and they‚Äôre traveling for today‚Äôs game.

No. The Soviets had no extermination policies.

&gt; You're saying that there is no free will and I'm not able to make any choice then?

You're still bundling baggage with the word ""choice"".

You seem to think the only possible ""choice"" is either ""I can choose anything"" or ""I can choose absolutely nothing"", instead of the actual reality is ""choice is what happens when a decision engine like the brain weighs up values and decides on an option out of a range of possible options""

the phrase ""possible options"" does not require the concept of contra-causal choice. It simply means that the machine weighs variables and depending on those variables can arrive at different choices.

the idea that this machine can pump out a different answer each time under identical circumstances but still be making a meaningful choice does not stand up to basic logic. If a choice is made for a reason then the choice has to stay the same every time the reason stays the same.

&gt;But it's the opposite: decisions require at least some level of indeterminism. A computer is not ""making a choice"" (apart from very metaphorical sense) about what if-else-branch it has to execute at any given moment. If there is no free will and you're ""feeling"" you're making a choice, that's an illusion.

Again, you're already defining ""choice"" that requires contracausal libertarianism, so you have assumed the conclusion in the premise of the definition.

There is no fundamental difference in the kind of choices computers make and the kind of choices humans make other than complexity.

&gt;Yup, a ghost in the shell, why not? I don't see anything wrong (or that can be proved to be wrong) here

"HistoricalWhatIf","t5_2si7z","Depends on outside circumstances, who rises to lead the Soviets, how far they get into Europe and a large variety of other factors. Need more details to tell.

For example, one of the major reasons for the USSR's collapse was that it spent a large amount of its annual budget (upwards of 25% of its GDP) on Defense Spending (read: tanks, guns, nukes). This was a futile attempt to compete with America in the arms race, and because of the Russian mentality that it will always be invaded.

If, however, the USSR overran most of mainland Europe (i.e. Germany, France, Italy) it wouldn't feel as threatened by the UK, and would spend a lot less on the military, therefore reinvesting into other sectors of the economy. Similarly, by acquiring additional satellite states in mentioned countries (which were signifiancetly more developed than Eastern Europe), the Soviets would gain access to large markets (whereas IRL they faced massive tariffs from Western nations).",1614556818

"TikTokCringe","t5_mvcq5","What are you talking about...

First of all, the word ‚Äúexclusively‚Äù was never used and yet you quote it to make a counter argument. lol. 

The point is that there ARE exceptions to the general presumptions, and that exceptions don‚Äôt mean we should completely ignore the obvious prominence of certain characteristics. Also, I don‚Äôt think the word ‚Äúnorm‚Äù does it justice. You can make the statement that ‚Äúdogs are four legged animals‚Äù because they ARE and stating that it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù doesn‚Äôt relay the statistical likelihood that the dog will most certainly have four legs. At the same time, you can point out that some dogs don‚Äôt have four legs. The fact that there is genetic variance and in rare cases dogs will be born without four legs doesn‚Äôt change the fact that dogs are still four legged animals.

The point that you‚Äôre missing is that just because there are rare exceptions to things doesn‚Äôt mean we need to change our definitions/perceptions. If that were the case, we would have no perceptions/definitions because there is quite literally an exception to everything. Take this: ‚ÄúHumans are biologically born male or female. However, there are rare exceptions.‚Äù There is nothing illogical about that. 

This isn‚Äôt a commentary on transgender rights or the science behind it, because I agree with both. But you‚Äôre missing the point and argue a bad one. With your logic, the statement ‚Äúvegetables are good for you‚Äù would be incorrect because someone somewhere has some sort of rare allergic reaction to vegetables.

Face is just slightly above average. The only improvement I can offer is to go for a different hair style. Don't part it down the middle. Maybe chop off a few inches too. Also some skincare for your forehead if you don't do lotions and stuff already.

We're good now, we're even on a few discords together and play games together sometimes, but it just hurt for someone who didn't even know to automatically see me as a monster.

I didn't choose to have BPD, we didn't choose to have BPD. Why would someone choose to have a mental illness that causes so much pain not just to the haver, but to those around them?

For Taylor to tweet this vile, disgusting heinous shit out, I'm sorry, cancel her, whatever, that is just mindblowing to me. I will spend every day of my life fighting against this stigma because I know I'm not a monster, I am a human with a mental illness who is trying to do her best.

You state that you agree with a quote that talks about preferring to live in one universe than another.  Do you think preference makes any difference to what universe we live in?

&gt;If our morality is a result of evolution the result would be a society that looks like ours. 

Agreed, if by 'society' you are taking the whole of society, we would expect to see wildly divergent morals as cultures have spread and to greater or lesser degrees had great or tiny influence on each other, and that such cultures have changed over millennia along with concepts of what constitutes morality. 

&gt; If morality is implanted by divinity with the free will to choose to follow it, then the result would be a society that looks like ours. 

Disagree. We would not expect to see the divergence and wildly different assumptions of what is moral or not across culture or time. 

If what you state had occurred, it means that people in country/culture X think honour killing is justified because there exists a pool of people whose free will somehow drew them together. That cultures who accepted slavery as moral were again somehow drawn to each by matching 'free will's. It is absurd.

The data shows us that what people have accepted as moral has differed significantly across regions and time, to state that this coincides with free will as an explanation is beyond nonsensical.",1614556819

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Hi SC

In theory, it would be so beneficial for all for all of the various forms of Buddhism to be able to have legitimate conversation (which includes safety for all parties). But it seems that it may not happen any time soon as the parties putting in effort confront behavior that is simply not okay.

First a little preliminary. I'm in the part of the US that was impacted by the polar vortex recently. I had actually started writing something for Medium (it's very rough but I could share the long intro I wrote if you want), but then the Insurrection and a long period without power happened. In addition, my health is poor at the moment (not Covid-19, not to worry) and I'm about to take a break from a lot of things in order to recoup. So I had to put this off, and honestly, as a householder in an unstable country, I don't think I'll finish writing my response. I'm not sure it would even do anything to encourage real dialogue from the segment of the internet that is determined to attack Secular Buddhism. However, I will touch on some points here for you.

...I suppose this can be broken down into this specific interpersonal interaction between the author and I and a broader current that is online.

(1) I do not wish to attack the author (he is a POC putting work out that, and in broad strokes, we all need to encourage that), especially unfairly, but this is what I came to out of our interactions (email).  


He sees himself as a ""warrior of truth"" (a paraphrase from an actual email exchange). This supports what I encountered which was unskillful belligerence and not only unwillingness, but actual shock that after I stopped him to establish who we were (e.g. pronouns, background), upheld the good and even beneficial elements of what he wrote (e.g. having yet another set of eyes besides the two POC who already wrote the FAQ - sure), that I insisted that we address the elements of his writing that were problematic.

In other words, he did not see this as a dialogue. He assumed he was ""setting me straight"" and had nothing to learn or change. When I insisted that problems be discussed, it devolved into personal attacks (etc). At which point, I listed my main points and finished walking away. You cannot dialogue with someone who doesn't want to engage in dialogue in the first place.  

Again, this is my side and posted without the original email exchange (because that would violate his privacy). However, know that I'd post the emails with permission and hear his side if he can engage in safe dialogue (below).  


(2) It could be, perhaps, that the author and I as individuals just can't communicate with each other effectively. That happens. #Samsara. But there's still a broader issue beyond that, the issue/s that the author refused to engage in.  


A) The author styled himself as akin to Arun (aka Angry Asian Buddhist). ...Where do I start...  


First, I grieve the passing of Arun as all do. And believe it or not, I respected him and his work. But AAB (abbv.) had a \*context\* that is being conveniently forgotten. In North America especially (and other parts of the world that are not Asia) there is a stereotype and a pressure for ""all Asian descendant people to be quiet"" (etc etc - I'm sure you don't need me to tell you all this). Arun's visible anger was authentic and a calculated rejection of that stereotyping, done to help his communities+ and with an eye towards intersectionality. 

What those like this author are missing is that they are NOT Arun. They are (in my honest experience) using a real social justice pioneer's work to be able to troll online without being called out for trolling. Arun didn't troll. IMHO, whether they realize it or not, people like this author are trolling. He's not a person of Asian/Diasporic descent angry at a real harm. He wants to believe himself to be a ""warrior of truth"" with lots of likes on Medium. (Support for this coming up below)  


B) The author styled himself as an ""academic"" as an excuse for his language as well. Let's unpack that real quick.  


I didn't even get to get  him to confront this (for himself), but he purposefully omits key parts of the FAQ that specifically address his linguistic concerns. There's an entire call in. First and foremost, that kind of convenient omission to misrepresent a source is considered academic dishonesty. (In a college in the US, if he submitted his Medium article as a paper and his professor clicked through to the actual FAQ, he could be pursued under academic dishonesty. I""m not kidding.) I find that this kind of dishonesty happens all of the time when dialogue is attempted, and no effort is made to acknowledge or correct it. There's a problem or conflict that needs to be resolved, and the way to start that process is to clearly understand the ""sides"" or ""opponents."" You cannot hold on to delusion and expect good outcomes. So this practice of purposeful misrepresentation has to stop if actual progress is to be made (and should it ever happen on this end, then by all means let me/us know and we'll do our best to improve. That's how this works.)  


Sorry I just needed to touch on that. Also, the dishonesty is part of why this is more trolling or bullying online.  


Anyways (C)  
As a general trend, many of those opposed to Secular Buddhism live in different parts of the world, or at the very least in different cultures from those of Secular Buddhism. I've given the benefit of the doubt that many may not realize they are doing this, but their characterization of Secular Buddhism and its practitioners is often racially offensive and actually harmful.

"anime","t5_2qh22","*A Tomino Fan‚Äôs Final Thoughts on Aura Battler Dunbine:*

So, here we are at the end of yet another Yoshiyuki Tomino show. You have to admit, the premise of this show certainly stand fairly uniquely among most of his other ones, due to it being one of the earliest isekai anime out there in addition to being a mech show. And that uniqueness really does show up in the fantastic bug-like designs of the Aura Battlers and the bizarre yet cool bits of worldbuilding for the world of Byston Well.

However, that‚Äôs not to say that Aura Battler Dunbine doesn‚Äôt have faults, it actually has quite a bit of them. Like, I think we can all agree that the mass-teleportation to Upper Earth was fairly squandered once it became less about everyone adjusting to the situation and more about fighting off King Bishott‚Äôs forces for a while. Sure, we had some interesting stuff in there like Jeryl being the first to enter Hyper Mode and Todd finally being defeated by Show, but those there just brief islands of activity in a cour that otherwise slowed down to a slog until the final battle.

But overall, I‚Äôd say that I liked Aura Battler Dunbine for what it is. It‚Äôs a unique show that honestly feels like a predecessor to Zeta Gundam. Trust me, the similarities are there. You can compare Todd Guinness to Jerid Messa, the transformable mid-series upgrades, or even the rather similarly intense final battles. It‚Äôs for those above reason that I‚Äôve decided to use my mecha-based rewatch rating scale to give Aura Battler Dunbine the rating of: **Rick Dias**. It certainly isn‚Äôt the most powerful, but the bits and pieces of it laid a foundation for future series to grow off of, whether you count Zeta Gundam or all the other Byston Well series.

Anyway, thank you all for being a part of this rewatch alongside me (even if that activity really petered out towards the end, which was real bummer), and thank you /u/Pixelsaber for hosting yet another Tomino show rewatch!",1614556820

"tretinoin","t5_31nsz","I started using tret (.025%) for mild/moderate acne, mostly deep cystic type (sometime coming to a head, sometimes not) and mainly on my chin, lower cheeks, and jawline. Before tret, I probably had maybe 5-7 active spots at a time, for reference.

About 2 months into tret, I noticed a pretty big flare-up that was mostly concentrated on my left side. I‚Äôd have several new spots every day, majority on the left. The only thing I could think of was that I may sleep more on my left side, so I started swapping out a clean pillowcase every few nights (bought a 10-pack of white ones on Amazon). Not sure if that ultimately factored into things much/at all. 

I just kept at it with the tret, lots of moisturizing, and BPO spot treatment. At about 4 months now, I only get maybe 1-2 new spots each week, and the rest of my skin is a lot smoother. It also seems that things are no longer disproportionately on one side. So I definitely think mine was purging and that things are going in a good direction now. 

I do notice that all breakouts I get while on tret seem to heal faster than before‚Äîthey start to calm down and almost flake away usually within less than a week IF I leave them alone. My biggest problem is picking/popping before they can heal, causing hyperpigmentation, so still working on that :D",1614556821

 I'm the asshole because I'm cutting him off since I don't approve of his new girlfriend. He's a grown man and pays me the money each week we agreed on and now I'm changing my mind about helping him.

If you make a principal only payment of $1000 (at any bank) your principal balance will go down $1000 but you will still owe your $500 on March 1.  This saves you interest on $1000 worth of principal. 

Some bank will let you ‚Äúpre pay‚Äù which just applies your balance forward. This means your March 1 and April 1 payments are taken out of your $1000 and your next bill is due May 1. This saves you zero interest and you are just paying now. 

Other banks will take your $500 March 1 payment out and then apply the remaining $500 to principal. Your next payment is still due April 1. This saves you interest on $500 worth of principal.",1614556823

"SeriousConversation","t5_345ie","Your argument is that society will only get a fraction of the skills that the murderer learns and therefore it does not make sense to provide that education.  This is an invalid argument.

1) Limited value after they get out is better than no value. When a murderer gets out now, they have little to no skills and therefore provides no value to society.  Lack of opportunity also increases recividism.

2) The skills they learn can be used while in prison. Carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, metal working, cooking, writing, history, etc. can all be used while in prison to help those on either side of the fence.  Some states utilize prison labor to build/make furniture and supplies used by other state departments as well as maintain the prisons themselves.

3) Learning these skills keeps inmates busy doing something productive which increases staff safety.

4)  The idea that justice is only served by the suffering of others is cruel and outdated.  Justice shouldn't be based on feelings, it should be based on actually correcting the wrong.  The wrong isn't the specific act, the the circumstances around it. After all, how is it justice if it results in another act of injustice (recidivsm) later?  Punitive measures do not reduce the chance of future harm therefore are not efficient at creating a better society. If creating/maintaining a good society isn't the goal, then why do we penalize people for crimes in the first place?

5) Morality demands creating a better place for people. Punitive measures fail to do that.

6) If you only create a system for bettering non-violent offenders, what do you think the violent offenders in the same system will do? Answer: they will harm the non-violent offenders. This increases victimization which means the idea of punitive justice does not create a more just society (by increasing victimization).",1614556823

If you don't pay, what are they going to do?  If they are moving into their own flat then maybe they could take one of the couches.

You could sell the jointly owned stuff and split the proceeds, buy new stuff with your new flatmates and this time make it clear that such flat purchases stay with the flat and are not reimbursed on leaving the flat.

Answer C:

Nothing outrageous like I said. Just overall things. We really just seem to have... more. 

I genuinely hope that doesn't make me sound like a douche. You guys have Healthcare and some countries even free education. But to be honest... if you are middle class here, neither of those things are an issue. Thats why they haven't been addressed.

That's not at all what Jimmy did. Jimmy wasn't interviewing Tucker. He used Tucker's platform to advocate his own opinions. He was on his show fir like 3 minutes. I don't see the problem with that at all, and I think infotainment television needs a lot more principled grandstanding. 

Jimmy has said plenty of shit about Tucker too, he doesn't pretend like Tucker is great. This criticism doesn't hold water. I also disagree that it's even necessary. This whole attitude like media figures need to handhold their audience is frankly idiotic and disturbing. We all know who Tucker is and what he's about, we're all adults here. I don't need my opinions spoonfed to me, least of all from fuckin Jimmy Dore. I'll certainly call Jimmy out as needed, but acting like we're a cult because we agree with the majority of Jimmy's opinions is asinine. If we're a cult then wtf does that make Vaush's audience?

The fact that he's the 2x reigning MVP makes it all the more stupid that he isn't getting nearly as much buzz as those other guys (outside of Bron and Joel).

She DID talk to him, she tried multiple different times for HOURS. What the hell else was she supposed to do? The only reason this ended was because she got lucky and he finally heard a name that made him reconsider. But make no mistake, she already was rational and still couldn't get through to him.

I‚Äôve gone winter camping a time or two, you can definitely do it, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to sleep that way for more than a long weekend. 

Even a lot of vans wouldn‚Äôt be very livable during winter here because they don‚Äôt have enough insulation, you‚Äôd have to run a heater on full blast, which would get expensive with our higher gas prices. 

There also just aren‚Äôt many good places to set up on a larger scale. The vast majority of the non-occupied space in the city limits is woodland and often has pretty steep slopes throughout. There are some areas with a decent number of tents, but not a ton.

Ultimately, homeless people go elsewhere if they possibly can. I expect Vancouver has more homeless problems than we do in Toronto, it‚Äôs the warmest part of Canada in the winter months.",1614556826

I don‚Äôt think breaking up with her nor staying with her are the wrong choices. I think both are reasonable and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot more to this situation than what you‚Äôve posted. But I will say if you decide to stay with her the next sign of this type of behavior you need to put your foot down and get out. People make mistakes and empathy and forgiveness is important. But the line between that and being a doormat are tough to discern when you are deep enough into a relationship. You are nearing that line. Perfectly reasonable to forgive her for this. But don‚Äôt make that a habit or you will be in for a world of pain in the future. 

Good luck, I hope everything here will work out for you whether you stay together or not.

Edit: what I mean In the end of the paragraph is that you need to set boundaries with her ASAP and make sure she understands how important they are. If she breaks those boundaries at anytime in the future, you should SERIOUSLY consider leaving her - in fact in 99% of circumstances you should. Respect yourself and your relationship.",1614556826

I hope they were brought up religious, since this would have given them the necessary programming to get hooked by propaganda later on, because the alternative is that the corporate propaganda can do that on *adults* without needing them to be preconditioned for blind belief as kids.

Both brought up Catholic and both rejected it.  My mom given massive pressure to marry early,and instead became a career girl in the city and married late twenties at a time when other girls around her were marrying at eighteen, in the sixties and seventies.  Constantly asked why she wasn't married yet because she wasn't ugly.  My mom is 1/16 Cherokee (we have photos of her half-Cherokee great grandma, so its not an idle claim) and was proud of it despite being continually told not to tell people because ""its like admitting to be part n#%$&amp;"", and when her aunt tried to jinx it for my.mom with my mom's handsome new bf (my dad) by informing him.of my.mother's NA blood (my dad being purebred European like the aunt) my dad said ""yeah, I know, I think its pretty cool"", stunning my.mom's aunt.

In the early 2000's, we were some of the few people opposing the Iraq War.

That makes it...yes,that makes it worse.

For example if the home is worth 100k and the lien is for 2k and the home sells for 100k they will (or escrow) pay the lien as part of the sale and walk away with 98k. Now, with that said, eventually the local government can likely auction off the home to satisfy the lien. This is usually measured in years. Being that this appears to be a problem that will occur next year as well they should just sell ASAP and move somewhere where they can afford it.",1614556828

Girls tend to be more about what feels right anyway so words don‚Äôt really mean to much here.

On the other hand communication is really important if you want to be in contact. 
Just make sure you both want the same for your relationship if your in contact or someone will get hurt. And that will hurt you both. 
Make sure you both know each others boundaries.

"lasercutting","t5_2xhcs","The difference between the two is literally in the head and air supply. You can have 18mm or 20mm lens in either.

An engraving set up holds the nozzle way up off the work, around 20mm, it has a large tip hole and a restricted air elbow.

A cutting set up positions the nozzle down close to the work in the 5 - 10mm range, has a small opening and unrestricted air elbow to put maximum air down into the cut to clear the out gasses. You can't see the out gasses, but it greatly reduces the effectiveness of the laser.

My best analogy to date, is trying to cut with an engraving set up, is like trying to drive at night with your high beams on in heavy fog. Get some good close air flow to clear the fog of the out gasses and the laser is happy.

In a lot of my posts, you will see me advocating for 20mm lens. But that is not for the lens, but what it practically guarantees you.

For most sub 100W machines, the 18mm lens is held in a lens tube and nozzle configuration that has an M20 thread. Finding parts and pieces to make upgrades and changes with an M20 thread is near impossible. Believe it or not, I wound up using a kitchen sink aerator adapter for a while to get to the M22.

Now when you get a 20mm lens, you are just about assured to get a lens tube and nozzle with an M22 nozzle thread. That 2mm makes a WORLD of difference. You can get all sorts of parts and pieces in any number of places. If you get lucky enough to get a unit with either a 24mm or 25mm lower lens tube, a $12 change will let you drop a 4"" lens in no problem, and take you pick of good air assist nozzles.

Take a close look at the first two pics on my Google Mod page, the fitting and nozzle are the physical part on the laser. Add a good air supply and you are all set.

Now, in a school environment, I would bet you have access to a 3D printer. If that's the case, then you can get one of the kids to design and print some good nozzles for the M20 threads and pick up some elbows down at the hardware store. Hook into the building air supply and you are all set.

Unless you are going to be working with fairly thick material, the 2"" or 2.5"" lens will be about as long as you will need to go. Unless I'm cutting thick foam for equipment cases or some 7/8"" clear pine the 4"" set up is sitting gathering dust. I have it in a zip lock snack bag for just that reason.

Take a pic of your cutting head and I can give you an idea of what your options are for your current machine. You said you have a 1.5"" lens. Does it sit down on top of the nozzle, or up in the lens tube? What is your current gap tip to work?",1614556832

Give those kind of outrageous reactions about as much importance as they truly deserve: none.

Remember, you're in charge. Especially when you try and take a step back from the situation, even from the fact that they're your parents and that you know them, and look at it from the outside objectively, when you then realize how ridiculous the whole thing is you'll realize your mom is just being irrational. Don't give her that power over you. She just has (many) issues about herself, and they have nothing to do with you. And very very antiquated and culturally specific views on ""womanhood"" and whatever that means.

I'd probably tell her that she can go ahead and cry if she wants to if that's what truly makes her happy, but that it's MY hair and she doesn't control me or my decisions and that I think (and the rest of my family in my case also) thinks my head looks HOT shaved and that I don't give a fuck what they think cause I love it.",1614556833

&gt; En otro caso, un menor, tambi√©n de 10 a√±os, sali√≥ de su domicilio en Santo Tom√°s Chiconautla alrededor de las 16:00 horas del s√°bado luego de que una de sus t√≠as lo rega√±√≥ por perder un l√°piz, por lo que su madre denunci√≥ el extrav√≠o del menor ante la Fiscal√≠a mexiquense, que pidi√≥ apoyo a la polic√≠a municipal de Ecatepec para localizar al ni√±o.   

&gt; La C√©lula de B√∫squeda de Personas de Ecatepec inici√≥ investigaciones y localiz√≥ a las 03:00 horas al menor en el domicilio de una de sus t√≠as en la colonia Casas Reales, tambi√©n ubicada en este municipio, donde el menor relat√≥ a su familiar que al hacer su tarea perdi√≥ un l√°piz y por temor a ser rega√±ado sali√≥ de su domicilio.   

&gt; Ambos menores fueron reintegrados a sus n√∫cleos familiares por la C√©lula de B√∫squeda de Personas de Ecatepec, en buen estado de salud y sin que fueran v√≠ctimas de delito alguno.

""The Drumhead"" for instance, is extremely relevant and that episode aired 29 years ago.

"olkb","t5_37yk3","Glad to know that you liked the Planck. How do you like the build quality? I watched some Youtube reviews and compared Planck against KDBfans Niu mini and recommended the latter. But that video was about 1\~2 years ago. 

I saw people rotate the keycaps by 180 degrees so the modifier keys/space bars have different angles. That might help to locate the modifiers? 

For me, being able to fluidly use the keyboard is more important that pure speed, so I won't worry too much if my speed drops from like 100 to 90, as long as the accuracy is high so I won't need to frequently fix things. 

I already use vim or vim-plugins in all my ides so navigation should be fine. I even map my current 60% so that even in Chrome I navigate the cursor with fn+hjkl (plus ctrl). so switching to a 40% won't make a big difference for me. But on a 40%, many symbols are now on fn layer, so I have to build new muscle memories as some of them are frequently used in both coding, and navigation in vim. I'm a bit worried that I'll have to choose between 40% keyboard or regular ones, if I make the change.",1614556834

Once the substrate is colonised it seems pretty contam resistant so I don't think it matters as much whether it's modified or unmodified at that point, it's just getting to that point. For me personally I definitely recommend multiple smaller tubs rather than one big one as if you get contam in the larger tub it's probably gonna be a gonner where as you can just move smaller tubs out and you have a chance of getting something out of it. Whether it pays off to do it this way I am still waiting to see as I have not had my first flush yet. Last attempt I had put it in just 3 of the large totes and all 3 got contam and had to be chucked out.",1614556835

The wingwoman took off her clothes off to go to sleep, but instead of going in her bed, she  jumped in ours and started kissing both of us, wearing only a bra and g-string.

I thought I hit the jackpot but the one who liked me wasn‚Äôt into it because she didn‚Äôt want that to be my first memory of her outside work. I understood because she‚Äôs a human being not just a stripper,  but from a personal standpoint, damn was that disappointing.

"SocialDemocracy","t5_2sjw0","Social democracy historically was a fully socialist ideology, and was essentially synonymous with democratic socialism - it advocates establishing a socialist society by gradual and reformist means within the frameworks of a democracy. Today, social democracy can be considered an ideology separate from democratic socialism, although (most) social democratic parties and politicians still retain the idea of transitioning into a socialist society **at least in name** - so they still pay at least lip service to that tradition. In Olof Palme's case, he was a genuine one, I believe, who attempted some form of transition towards socialism with the Meidner Plan in the 1970s to give workers more control in the economy.

For example, the UK Labour Party constitution declares itself a democratic socialist party, despite being social democratic in policy; the Swedish SAP talks of democratic socialism as well, as does the Australian Labor Party and other social democratic parties. Heck, some social democratic parties have socialist in their very name - the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), for instance, or the French Socialist Party (PS).

Additionally, there is the idea of [ethical socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_socialism), which defines socialism not in Marxian terms as ""state ownership over the means of production"", but rather in terms of values and principles of egalitarianism, social justice, solidarity, cooperation and similar things, and defends policies rooted in those values, and thus strongly supports the welfare state, for instance. That's what I, for instance, refer to when I call myself a socialist, and that's what most social democratic parties refer to when they call themselves socialist these days.

Additionally, I think social democrats aren't specifically *for* capitalism as much as they 1) don't see any viable alternative to it, 2) believe we should work within capitalism anyway to make reforms right now, to make life better for people right now. I would describe us as working to ""humanise"" capitalism and ameliorate its harmful effects.",1614556836

"funny","t5_2qh33","I will tell you: it is knowing how to fry.

Sure, you can brine it. Double breading it is good for this type of crust. Spices are all personal preference.

But frying it *properly* is the key top crispy chicken.

The chicken needs to be warmish: if it's too cold inside, it will take too long to cook, and the oil will go into the breading. 

The oil needs to be at the right temperature. If it's too hot, it'll burn the chicken. If it's too cold, the oil will go into the breading. 

The chicken must be cooked the right amount of time: too short, and it won't be done, and too long, and the oil will go into the breading. 

You must not crowd the fryer...Everything you put in there lowers the oil temperature, it's very tricky to maintain that perfect temperature at home.

If you do it *just* right, you can pop it out of the oil, give it a couple of shakes, and have a wonderfully crispy and not at all oily piece of fried chicken. But it takes a good amount of practice.",1614556837

Focus on cultivating healthy relationships, and by that I mean friendships with people who reciprocate general affection and effort.

The murder mystery part was supposed to be a surprise but it got leaked in advance so we all kind of knew and were bracing ourselves for the start. 

Once it happened, the actors were supposed to be very obvious and over the top - like having an allergic reaction and coughing aggressively then collapsing - before solving the mystery of who poisoned them.

Getting rejected by them is not a bad sign per se because you have other interviews lined up but just be aware of this.

To better clear up your confusion though, ""berapa usia Andi"" literally translates to ""how much is Andi's age"". Indonesian has a separate word ""berapa"" to ask about amount of something, while ""how much"" in English is using the word ""how"" that is normally used to ask about manner of something. So ""how old is Andi"" in Indonesian would directly translates to ""seberapa tua Andi?""

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Correct take 

Got a little nervous after seeing your first ex say yes a PG would help lol but overall yes this is all right. The 132 defensive rating with Morris at the 5 where you turn everybody who comes into the paint into Zion Williamson 76% dFG% at the rim is the biggest issue. Would agree on over reliance with Morris at the 5 but tbh it‚Äôs matchup based was fine with it tonight. Just uselessly spamming PG/Kawhi pick and rolls so one of them can take a pull up jumper over a 6‚Äô8 or 6‚Äô11 defender is asinine. No threat of either guy slipping even if you blitz

Other big issue is everybody in the nba knows Kawhi Leonard wants to go right often to the general elbow area for late game pull ups. And they‚Äôre still so overeliant on it. Giannis screwed up one of their plays at the end wirh Kawhi going right knowing this. When they aren‚Äôt spamming Kawhi/PG pick and rolls they‚Äôll waste 12 seconds in a poss trying to get Kawhi a switch onto a lesser guard just so he can get a similar quality look from mid range he could get otherwise doing anything else as a fallback",1614556839

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","I think we need set rules for what I'd socially acceptable.

Just for example, there was that incident with a big country star (Morgan something?) who was heard saying the n-word while drunk. He wasn't using it to be discriminatory but instead as slang. He was boycotted and lost all record deals then all his music was taken off of streaming apps like Spotify, and now the only place you can find his music is YouTube. If this is considered against the rules for everybody then I'm okay with that we can let it be the standard.

But on the flip side, rappers say that word all the time in their music and it can often be discriminatory. Some people say it's okay for black people to say that word and others don't, but they often use it in a discriminatory fashion and I find that it often pushes it into pop culture. Kids are growing up listening to rap and hip hop... can we really expect that each and every child will simply not sing along or skip the n-word? What about Eminem doing the same thing in his music? He's a white man and the record labels have no problem with him calling black people the n-word in his songs, and yet this country singer said it as slang in his private life and did not use it to refer to black people but he was completely canceled.

So I think we have no standards and it's simply okay for some people to say it while others are harshly punished for it even in the same context as the former people who are allowed to say it. I think we need standards for what is and isn't acceptable instead of canceling certain people but looking the other way for others. I don't ever say the n-word so I don't care what that standard is, whether it be acceptable in slang, acceptable unless used to insult a black person, or acceptable never. But I think we need a standard.",1614556840

I can guarantee that I would tell you all the same shit to your face.  But you're not in the habit of believing me about basic facts... your prerogative, I suppose.

Not really.  I pointed out that your question was objectively flawed.  *You're* just having a little juvenile meltdown.  They're not really the same thing.  Not even close.

I'm not capable of answering this question because I don't know what that's like.  That's more your domain.  Do you feel tired?

This analogy isn't really fair, all subjective considerations aside (you've responded to me just as many times as I've responded to you, so if we're using that as a basis for our determination of who's the gnat here, that can't be it), because I have not even been close to being ""swatted"" during all of this.

The lack of increased sales prior to the lockdown is the proof.

So we feel it's not like they didn't get their fair share of using them.

The other aspect was that we all failed to agree at the time what to do in the situation of someone moving out. I would not have been keen to contribute to buying this furniture had I known in future I'd have to pay out even more for them.

The other part that sucks is that one of them managed the flat account, and they took $100 out of it to pay themselves out, without telling us.

I took over the flat account and couldn't work out why the money wasn't right. I asked them and they admitted they took the $100. Both me and the other flatmate feel pretty upset about this.

We got into a bit of a verbal fight about it, they agreed to send us back the $100. But it really destroyed my trust in them because they took money from the shared flat account without telling us, and because they could.

Seriously don't do/not do it based on looks.  That's honestly not giving you OR the person you're talking to enough credit. A lot of people deserve way more credit than that.  I know plenty of really beautiful people who have great friendships with people who aren't nearly as traditionally attractive as them, and some of them even date/get married.  Don't assume everyone is so shallow, my dude.  Sounds like you are a great person to talk to and when you have a great connection with someone that is clearly mutual, don't overthink it -- you won't be a creep, chances are exceptionally high that the person you are hitting up with a friend request or even ask for a phone number will be glad about it if you have already had a great, hours-long conversation.  Looks seriously aren't as important with everyone as you are implying.  Your thinking almost implies that the only possible relationship you could have had with this person is a sexual one, and since you thought there was no chance of that, no need to hit em up.

My point about softening edges was more for leaving yourself some room to make small corrections as you draw. Soft edges allow you to redefine contours.

CBJ era has been odd in the sense that every time we *think* a foundation has been built - the keystone leaves whether it's Bob, Bread, or PLD. Just looking back at the Torts era - who was the building block that he was supposed to build around and is he still around? 

But I digress, what bothers me now is that this team is utterly falling apart defensively (aka the car isn't running like how it usually does even compared to last year), and Torts' track record says this shouldn't happen and we (the fans) can see certain players massively under performing even just defensively.

It was quite literally the foundation of our country.

Its just gotten worse since then, until the slaves were freed. But then came the challenge of systematic racism and oppression. You're so right that a lot of it was justified through religion, Which is disgusting in itself. Theres still not separation of church and state even though there's laws saying that there is.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Honestly, fear (usually of pain) can be a hell of a thing. Is it worth an addiction? Almost definitely not. Does it drive prescription users to pursue more (potentially harder) drugs? Absolutely.

Also, in my opinion, cases of addiction in high schoolers are *particularly* sad. My interpretation of those using drugs in high school is that the individual usually has some underlying issues driving usage (not all the time, boredom can also be a factor). Also, regardless of why they're doing it, these are children who do not possess fully-developed brains. Addiction is an issue that some adults can't contend with, let alone kids...

For what it's worth, I know adults who've taken opiates and been scared shitless because of their power to induce euphoria. Many addiction-causing drugs feel *great* (despite causing underlying problems), which is why people use them. I'd argue that some of the staunchest ""anti-addict"" people out there probably haven't experienced these drugs, and, therefore, can't understand the appeal for those in physical/psychology stress.

Please don't think that I'm attacking you personally. I'm just stating my observations and promoting compassion toward addicts.

Tl;dr: 
(1) People can seek drugs due to fear. 
(2) Childhood/teen addiction is terrible regardless because the user is not fully-developed.
(3) Drugs are scary *because* they make you feel great. Try to understand your fellow human who may not have your circumstances/resolve.

1.2 per day 

8.4 per week

33.6 per month 

403,2 per year

So at the moment you would ""lose"" less than $40 a year for not staking - if you do it with G-Pool and the service stays free. Sure if TFuel 10x it would be money, but at some point it's pretty likely that Tfuel get's capped by higher inflation so it doesn't become to expensive for jobs. Long story short if you don't have enough for 1000 coins it's not a deal breaker, it's nice to have but no necessity. Important for smaller investors is the staking will keep a great block of coins in strong hands so the available Theta will probably get less and less what should be great for the price.",1614556847

I told her about my terrible first insertion experience and asked for anti-anxiety medication and more pain management.

I‚Äôve heard mixed things about whether the cervical blocks are worth it, but I have to try something else.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","After what happened to SWSH, I get it. They seem to put more effort in their trailers and presentation than they do the actual games. So much money is poured into the advertisement and glitz than the games so of course when it's a routine that's been happening for many years people would be adamant and keep their expectations low after being burned so many times.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the fact that you haven't played since Ruby / Sapphire shows why you don't seem to get it. That's 2003. According to you, you haven't touched a Pokemon game for what - 16 years? There are people here leveling valid criticisms who did not stop playing the game like you did. So maybe be a little more charitable and actually understand why people are reacting that way.

I noticed this when SwSh came out in 2019 that a lot of people either play dumb or downplay the criticisms of fans and they openly admit that they haven't touched a Pokemon game in 10+ years. You would think they'd engage with these people but no, they craft up posts like yours and imply that they will never be happy when what they actually want are the Pokemon games to do better because we know they CAN be better.

A lot of what is being said about Legends is from experience and the consistent cycle of Game Freak where they over promise and under deliver. Everything is so flashy and then when we get the final product, it doesn't live up to the hype and excitement that lead up to it. I've been through this for many years which is why I skipped on SwSh because I'm not going to facilitate the cycle. 

Legends is a good direction for the Pokemon series. But let's see if Game Freak can execute it because so far I'm leaning on they won't based on their history. They have this habit of showing a game months before release and the final product looks exactly the same from the point in time where they first introduced the game. I'm hoping this doesn't apply to Legends and I do hope they delay the game to work on it more. Because if this game has been in development for 2 years or however long - it's not impressive. Not when you have other JRPGs on the platform that look and play better than what Game Freak puts out. For crying out loud - The Witcher 3 is on the Switch.

I don't want to hear any more excuses of ""It's a Pokemon game"" or the contradiction ""You can't judge a game you never played"". Dragon Quest XI came out in 2017 and released on the Switch in 2019. It's one of the best JRPGs on the console and the closest to Pokemon when it comes to turn based battles. SwSh shouldn't look or play the way it did. It is unacceptable when you have other games on the console that provide a better experience. 

We'll see what GF can do. I hope they enlisted assistance from other Nintendo studios like Monolith Soft, because they're going to need it. The project they are working on now is too ambitious for their own sake because as of recent they have been incredibly apathetic about the games they have made so far. This isn't the Heart Gold and Soul Silver era of Pokemon. They need to get with it.",1614556849

""Their brains literally don't work right."" That's not exactly true and mental health issues can be healed. Every child can learn from consequences, every single one no matter what trauma they have been through. They need stability, unconditional love and predictability. They are not broken, there is nothing inherantly wrong with them. The way you perceive them is a HUGE issue honestly. I understand they are difficult, but it's not their fault. They can have a normal life and it's your responsibility to get them the help they need and to be the parent they need. And what you just said means you aren't. Please get individual therapy for everyone including family therapy. I'm not sure why you're taking children in, but you did so you should at least learn more about PTSD because the way you think of it is not accurate.",1614556849

Keep in mind that if a property comes back onto the market in a short while, people are going to look at it with caution; their thinking would be that ""there's some problem with the place, if someone bought it and sold immediately after"". More so if it isn't a rehab flip.

It may be that the hot market allows you to sell; it may be that you don't get the kind of upside, either because of the short duration or because of the ""immediate sale"".",1614556851

The first one is related to fire hydrants. I was staring at one that wasn‚Äôt red, and was like, why tf are they different colors? So I looked it up, and Google says: ‚ÄúThe tops of hydrants are painted in colors to indicate how much flow they can produce in gallons per minute (gpm).‚Äù I was gobsmacked lol.

I also was staring at my pink lemonade drink mix box recently, and wondered if pink lemons even existed. It turns out, they do, but they are not the source of pink lemonade, as their juice or whatever is clear. The origin of pink lemonade seems to be unclear, but possibly came from the circus.

Also, in WWII, the Nazis were their usual jerkface selves and stole a bunch of thoroughbred horses from Austria for their cavalry breeding program or whatever. The US Army found out about this towards the end of the war, and General Patton approved the rescue mission for the horses. (He liked horses a lot, evidently. He was in charge of a cavalry unit at one point and even competed in riding at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912. Ironically, he was k!11ed mere months after WWII ended in a car accident involving another member of the military.) Anyway, the US Army ended up saving the horses, but IIRC there was some controversy about repatriating them to Austria afterwards... (I read the book about this, called ‚ÄúThe Perfect Horse,‚Äù by Elizabeth Letts. Highly recommend!)

Finally, it‚Äôs not common knowledge, but in 1942, the Japanese decided that it was a good idea to b0mb the West Coast. They ended up like shelling Oregon‚Äôs coastline, and intended to set f!re to the forests because I guess they‚Äôd heard about f!re issues on the West Coast somehow? They managed to start maybe one, but it was ultimately just a victory in the propaganda sense. I‚Äôd never heard about this in any of my history classes! IIRC they also had plans for NYC and DC. Totally crazy!

Hope you found these interesting. Sorry if it‚Äôs too much but I really like to share these (I‚Äôm super into WWII history because my grandfather, born in 1913, fought in the war and liberated camps).

I also said some, not all use them, and I really do believe that there are authors who use them. There's nothing wrong with using a ghostwriter, especially if the plot and characters are yours, because I know there's pressure to keep churning out books because it keeps your name relevant. 

That's also why I think James Patterson uses ghostwriters but calls them co-writers to hide the fact. Again, I've no problem with that because he has to keep a steady stream of books flowing and he has more ideas then time to write them. So he gives the outline to another writer who writes the story and he either rewrites some of it or whatever and puts it under his brand.",1614556853
"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","You can leave dungeons in Persona 4 and 5 by using a Goho-M (go home). Persona 5 apparently even has [safe rooms](https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Safe_Room#Persona_5). I only have experience with Persona 4: Golden, but some of the same rules apply in the original:

You generally have two to three in-game weeks to finish a dungeon in Persona 4, *ideally* you try to finish them in one day so you can spend more time with social links/etc.

* Teddie and Yosuke [bring up](https://youtu.be/j0MCZPDtOHw?t=105) the 'time limit' after the battle on the 2nd floor of the first dungeon.
* [Teddie gives you](https://youtu.be/j0MCZPDtOHw?t=1216) 3(?) Goho-Ms for free afterwards if you talk to him outside of the dungeon's entrance.
* If you use a Goho-M, [you can resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/9py6n4/just_started_persona_4_have_a_few_questions/e8561ju/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from the first floor or the floor you left at.
* When leaving a dungeon, that day is essentially over. You can return to the dungeon to continue with full HP and SP [after resting](https://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1jomxs/persona_4_sp_help/cbgrc1x/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).
* If you fail the dungeon rescue, [the game rewinds](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/945498-shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/59903108) (spoiler in post #3) so you don't softlock yourself.",1614556853

I don't know if you remember back when they launched, but the board partners were complaining‚Äìquite significantly‚Äìabout how they couldn't possibly sell anywhere near MSRP based on the cost of the die+DRAM kits from Nvidia. And the component shortages haven't helped anything here.

I'm sure this all played into it, and that was just a sacrifice that someone on the team decided was worth making.

Idk, imo if there would be a virus from my country, and people would say ""its the XYCountry Virus"" I wouldnt care at all. However the stupid people thinking its because of all chinese, is just stupid. However Eating Bats is more a chinese thing, so its kinda their fault to eat food that is often contagious with Corona... Thats just stupid. But as it only needs one person that is stupid enough not to cook it well, all chinese will get a bad negotiation (actually a different word but I forgot what its called)

Also Some people still think that the Chinese goverment did it on purpose, and the fact that china is now pretty well doing with corona does just approve the irrational thinking of this by a small/medium/big part. 

Imo the chinese goverment is just a very very bad goverment. Many similarities with the nazis and other facists doing very shitty things. So I dont think that is not an option, but I also dont think how it happened, Im just thinking the chinese goverment is so egoistic and doesnt care about human life/worth that it could be possible, as chinese market increases by this. I mean the idea is so incredible horrific to think of, but only one person is needed on the wrong position to make this happen. And unfortunately a lot of assholes do rule... I just hope this is not the case.

"Anarchy101","t5_2s960","&gt;Of course not.

&gt;But that's a separate question from 'are they oppressed in the same sort of ways that they oppress workers in the west?'

‚ÄãThe answer is that Chinese billionaires benefit from the exploitation of the proletariat more than almost any Capitalist State in the world.

&gt;I mean, it seems like your headed for the will smith defence there.

&gt;'Will smith is black and rich, therefore racism over.'

Huge deflection. You dodged the reality of Chinese Billionaires and tried making a non sequitur. 

&gt;Or in context: 'Bourgeois have money, therefore not oppressed.'

&gt;Tell that to Jack MA.

Jack MA, the Jack MA that became a top 50 richest persons in the world under the watchful eye of the Chinese ""Communist"" Party? 60+ Billion dollars made exploiting literal sweatshop workers Jack MA?

Yeah he seems to be real oppressed. /s

&gt;Or the ones they executed for shitty behaviour.

&gt;That's a dictatorship of the proletariat.

Are you actually using executions as a positive aspect of China? Even if I agreed with that, 10-15 Billionaires being executed in a decade doesn't stop the hundreds of other billionaires from making wealth by exploiting the proletariat, nor the central State extracting the value of the Proletarian's work. 

You simp for State Capitalism and pretend the benevolent ""Communist"" Party of China actually benefits the 99% of it's members. It doesn't. It elevates the few on the backs of the many. It fails in all aspects of Marxist Socialism-Communism, and dotp.",1614556856

"AirForceRecruits","t5_2q94jn","Hello, it looks like you're asking about jobs and job selection. 

A few quick answers.

NO ONE knows how long it will take for you to get a job, your chances of getting any particular job, or anything else about the job process FOR YOU. Anecdotal experiences from others will have absolutely no impact on you or your future.

Most recruiters will not let you wait in the Delayed Entrance Program for a long time for your one perfect job. You will have to list 5 - 15 jobs that you're interested in, and will be given one of those. 

Please read the FAQ about how job selection works, it's very in-depth and will fully educate you on the process: https://pay.reddit.com/r/AirForce/wiki/bmtfaq#wiki_jobs

If you're asking about particular jobs, please look the job up on our Job Wiki, and see if there is an entry for it: http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/wiki/index

If you're asking for help choosing a particular job, please keep in mind that most people only know about their individual job. Recommendations that they make will be made based mostly on what they've heard about a job, unless they have it themselves. Some people will love certain jobs while others will hate it. We don't know your preferences, so do some research on the job wiki and elsewhere to learn about the job and then make the best list you can.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I didn‚Äôt realize it until it was too late.

It all started with the disappearance of the Statue of Liberty in New York. Nearby witness explained that all of sudden, the monument just disappeared into thin air. The next few days, the same phenomenon occurred again and again. In all parts of the world, the world‚Äôs most famous statues all vanished without a trace.

The general public quickly pointed out who the only culprit could be. After all, these miraculous feats could only be performed with power outside of human bounds. I couldn‚Äôt easily cast suspicion on our new allies though. As president of the Human Alien Relations Committee, I could only describe our bond with the extraterrestrial creatures as amiable. We had successfully cooperated together on many occasions; learning each other's languages within a few weeks, sharing technology to help colonize the moon and other planets, and simply teaching the other more about the universe we live in. 

However, upon recalling one past conversation I had with the leader of the aliens, I decided to confront it at their base on Earth.

‚ÄúDo you still believe that statues are imprisoned beings?‚Äù I questioned.

‚ÄúWell of course, after all, their form and stature resemble giants,‚Äù their leader calmly responded.

‚ÄúBut why? Have I not already explained how the statues are just inanimate objects made of material? Besides, there are no such things as giants on Earth!‚Äù I frantically spoke with the truth slowly dawning upon me. ‚ÄúSo does this truly mean that you guys are the ones responsible for the statue heists.‚Äù

The alien leader walked close towards me, taking a few seconds to respond. ‚ÄúWell, to answer your second question, it‚Äôs true, but you still claim these ‚Äústatues‚Äù were never living? The rest of the aliens and I cannot accept this, for we have seen our own imprisoned in stone just like you humans have captured these giants. Petrification is an intolerable crime, so we have vowed to free all of those trapped by this malady and punish the perpetrators across this universe.‚Äù

I stood still in shock for a few seconds, digesting all that I heard. My feet started to slowly pace backward with the word ‚Äúpunish‚Äù resounding in my mind.

After a brief silence, I attempted to retort, ‚ÄúWell um, I‚Äôm sorry about what happen-‚Äù

The alien leader cut me off and sighed. ‚ÄúNow that I have divulged our secrets to you, you may no longer return to your own.‚Äù Before I could process his words and escape, he pulled out a foreign device shaped like a gun and pointed it at me. It pulled the trigger and sent a red beam of light towards my arm. Losing total control of my body, I fell over onto the ground in complete paralysis.

Staring at my arm while I lay on the ground, I finally understood what aliens planned for us all along. In my last few moments of consciousness, I stared at my wounded arm and witnessed skin miraculously transform to stone. As my feeling of everything drifted away, I silently wished that we could win the ensuing battle against the enemies we welcomed into our home.",1614556856

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","I think a lot of this is just based on speculation of what you want the characters to be. People thought Adam was gonna be grey in V1-2... based on what? He doesn't even appear. People thought Sienna was gonna be grey.... again, based on nothing. Again, Raven: until we meet her in V5, we know absolutely nothing about her, other than that she left Tai. 

Hazel I thought was executed very well - he's the exact example of what you're talking about, but from the other side. A good character who was manipulated into doing bad things and then saw his error and was redeemed. And even though it hasn't been stated explicitly, I think he has forced Ozpin to confront his past actions and possibly change.

Ozpin *is* a grey character, and I haven't seen any sign of that changing. They were mad at him in V6 and are still pretty mad at him. After his experience in the whale - well, he and Oscar are merging - they're both coming to see the other's POV. And they've seen the consequences of trusting people too much - Leo, and of not trusting them enough - Ironwood. So I think his story is far from over.

Ren has always been a very muted character - it's like his semblance transcends the show and prevents us from seeing what he's thinking. I feel like his biggest issue in V7-8 has been screentime - we've had hints of what he's going through, but there's always more important shit happening. In particular, I think a long talk with Yang in the snow after he went out to ""brood"" would've helped tie his arc together.

Ironwood - well like you said, his progression into paranoid dictator is pretty natural. If you've already shot a kid, what's shooting a councilman? What's blowing up half a kingdom to save the other half? Ironwood's arc is primarily about Ironwood, it doesn't also have to be about changing the heroes, even though it has done that. We've had RWB sit in the manor not knowing what to do, we've had Ren question all their choices. You say they'll come out of this affirmed in all their choices, but that's absolutely not true. For one, they are contradictory - was it wrong to have trusted Leo too much, but then also wrong to have not trusted Ironwood enough? For another, they could still very easily fuck it up  - by opposing Ironwood now, they are both still playing into Salem's hands. They could easily lose Atlas, or Mantle, or both. And if that happens, saying ""well we were right, he should've worked with us"" is equivalent to saying ""well he was right, we should've worked with him"".",1614556856

It gives a more natural look because it isn't cakey (as long as you don't use too much) and loose powder sits nicely on it if you want a more matte look. My favourite part is that it doesn't start sliding around or looking icky when I wear it during the long, busy days.

"wisconsin","t5_2qrc2","After reading as much as I could about the two candidates in the last week, here are my thoughts on Lasry so far:    
    
Like most billionaires, Lasry is on record as not supporting medicare for all, whereas Nelson is on record as strongly in favor of it. Healthcare is the domestic issue that touches almost every other - income disparity, financial stability, employment insecurity, racial inequality, and so on. M4A is the right way to address the question of how to provide healthcare to everyone in this country. Due to his failure to support M4A, I consider Lasry's professed concerns for things like the minimum wage and labor rights as cynical marketing rather than principled beliefs. I believe we need representatives who will fight for M4A, so Lasry does not have my vote.",1614556856

As a self-excluded person, losing money at a casino does not entitle you to have that money returned. The penalty for a gaming operator who fails to prevent you from gambling is that any money they won from you is forfeited to the *state*, not returned to you.

Once you sign up for self-exclusion, you have a strong incentive not to attempt to violate it, which is that you can lose money but you cannot win money, i.e. you would not be allowed to collect any of your winnings if the casino found out that you were self-excluded.",1614556856

I think you may be able to compare your reaction to an ion exchange water purification system.  

I'm guessing you want to measure concentration of the analyte before and after the hydrogel over time.  Essentially looking for when it (1) gets saturated and needs to be regenerated/flushed/changed out (2) when analyte passes when flow rate is too high (3) any pressure increase/drop in the pipe at various conditions that might require different pumps.

Other properties that may be worth investigating are mass change of the hydrogel over time.  Think of it like a filter that is getting blocked or corroded.  For instance, silica-based ion exchange systems will lose silica mass over time as the particles break up small enough to pass the filter - and you don't want silica in hot water systems because it's going to slowly deposit on the insides of your pipes.

Temperature of the hydrogel or before/after the filter.  If a reaction is exothermic you don't want your system getting too hot.  Main reason to look at temp is that the absorption properties can change depending on the temperature of the water.  Often, hotter water means lower absorption so you need a slower feed rate or a longer filter pathlength.",1614556857

"RavnicaDMs","t5_sqrmw","The guilds kind of know. But that info is a bit hush hush.

See, the plane of Ravnica was affected by the rift crisis of Dominaria. Ravnica became isolated from the rest of the Multiverse. Planes walkers could not enter and the spirits of the dead could no longer move on to the afterlife, in the course of time this resulted in the Ghost Quarter of Agyrem. 

The Parhelion was first constructed as a skyship in an attempt to find out about Ravnica's planeswalker visitors who had stopped coming, but when the angels flew it to the edge of Ravnica's existence they encountered only emptiness. It was later repurposed as the Boros headquarters. It was located high above the city of Ravnica, amongst the clouds. In times of war, the Parhelion would descend and dock with Sunhome.

And honestly, I think that the easiest to plot is the Boros. Interplanar threats and preparations are sort of their mandate, and they will go to ANY lengths to ensure that Ravnica is secure. The legion started as the army of a city named Ravnica. If you have spelljammers, well the Boros are very interested in that technology. 

Then there is project Lightning Bug. Curious about the Living Guildpact that had foiled his plans, Niv-Mizzet set Ral Zarek the task to trace Jace and research Jace‚Äôs many sudden disappearances. After Niv-Mizzet revealed that he had known about the existence of other planes, planeswalkers and the threat of Nicol Bolas, he had Ral turn Project Lightning Bug into a beacon to call other planeswalkers to help fight Bolas.

Some guilds may care little, like the Gruul, some may seek how to exploit the situation, like the Orzhov. Some would seek to keep it under control, like the Azorius, and some would actively seek to explore other worlds, like the Simic.

Personally, I love the idea of spell jamming much more than the outlands and the great wheel cosmology, and the notion of a Boros controlled defense fleet is kind of sweet. 

The one advice I have for the more D&amp;D attempts to expand Ravnica is to scrap the whole blood war. The guild pact compels fiendish and infernal powers to serve the city, and any devil seeking to get souls will find that their contracts are undermined by the guild pact. 

Actually, the guild pact ultimately is Ravnica‚Äôs most powerful inter-planar defense. As it‚Äôs magic works to undermine those who seek to harm the city.",1614556858

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","Not a lot this week, but here's what I have seen:

*Blind Chance* (1987) - if you like *Dekalog* then check out the film Kieslowski made just before he made that series, because it's a film that has a similar look, feel, and concern with how momentous life decisions hinge in innocuous and unpredictable moments. A guy hears his dad is dying and runs for the train; something happens on that sprint and then we see his life play out three radically different ways. A little oblique in parts but definitely recommended.

*Uncle Buck* (1989) - a childhood favourite but I sort of begin to notice i. how the editing is weirdly choppy ii. how some scenes are basically like little comic sketches of no real consequence iii. how Buck is actually kind of an asshole; a different asshole to the uptight suburbanites he's related to, but an asshole all the same. Still lots of funny parts but not quite the scream I remember. None of the flaws of the film are John Candy's fault.

*The Other One* (1977-79) - very much a lost BBC sitcom. There's not even a Wikipedia page for it. Two men - one a compulsive liar, the other gullible - meet waiting for the same flight and become stuck together. It isn't flawless and when it isn't the two main characters it loses something, but there are these moments between the leads (Michael Gambon and Richard Briers) that are weirdly perfect.

*Marwencol* (2010) - interesting documentary about the man that the feature film *Welcome to Marwen* would be about. Performance inside performance inside performance; a hall of mirrors.

Aside from this there's been a test match and a snooker tournament on, so limited watching!",1614556858

The fact that you're defending Fidelity with personal attacks is odd. Of course it gets personal when you start coming at people on a thread soliciting for people's opinions, personally undermining them for not supporting your company. Do you work for Fidelity?

I would give you some highlights from my resume but I don't want to put that much personal information into this thread. I know incompetent software when I see it/use it. The issues with Active Trader pro aren't just platform compatibility with MacOS, but also very poor design, poor features and obviously bad implementation. Instability like that is always due to shitty programming. Requirements interpretation mistakes and bad design in well implemented software gives well defined errors that are deterministic, and easily isolated and fixed.

U always have plenty of white couples for interracial but never black love really so that is why its an issue. Love is love but represntation is representation too, I think most of us want to feel desired from own race, I dont think white people would like if all the white bachelors or bachelorettes just chose poc everytime and their was never a white couple. I mean its get to point u wonder do these people even like their own. I mean u say its racist to want him to choose a black woman, well its also racist to if ur not even attracted enough to ur own to pick a black person.

Secondly Luli, together with Mona (LSI) and her husband (the president) are kinda like a meme and people arent taking them seriously.

Only lately Luli is showing how he is going to make Albania better for everybody (great again?!?), while all this time, while having Rama as a prime minister, he has chanted and tried to organize protests and revolts for like anything and tries to paint his counterpart and everyone against him with negatives, while making himself look like a clown, he is immature and yes he has confidence and can show charisma but those feel forced and can turn into arrogance soon enough. 

As I said, dont get me wrong, i dont like Rama and me and everyone else would have gone for Basha if all he did was to shut up and give some positive examples to Albanians.",1614556862

"powerrangers","t5_2s49e","Alright time for some critiques and reasons they actually do put effort into the show, you just ignore it to have a point.

&gt; The actors audition and are serious about being in it, not just there because they will be paid, be but because they want to be. 

They do, the Sudarso's recently though for most it is a job since an actor would want a job. Most actors in PR do both, they like being there and want to be paid. 

&gt; The Costume. There is a general design, bit the actors can make changes for the character they play. So there would be a sigil for the team and the colour, but that can put badges on it or collect armour from defeats foes and add it to their costume. 

They do this depending on the team, kinda. I don't know what you mean here can you clarify? But they do have uniforms that reflect the team depending on the team. 

&gt; The Morpher. It would be concealed somewhere on their person, like in a belt buckle, or the underside of a watch and to morph they just press a button. A wave goes out from the morpher and the y are transformed. Simple. No fancy transitions and it gets the job done. 

They've had this for the past season and the current one (Beast Morphers and Dino Fury). They push a button and the morpher is transported to them and they morph. Also in universe there is no transition, it's a flash of light for everyone in universe (aside from a few times in Lightspeed Rescue). The morph is just there because it's a kids TV show. 

&gt; The stunts. Get good stunt doubles, or, if you can, get the actors to do some of it. So the as tiny doubles can get a fell for how the actors do things and it could actually have a difference in the sound when they are morophed. 

This is what they've had and done for years.

&gt; Get the original Zordon and Alpha 5 designs back. Also, I think that the new main bad guy should be Rita's replacement on getting earth for Zed's empire. 

Your contradicting yourself, in the final point you want no repeated themes but you also want to repeat something. We've come a long way since these two and we need to keep moving forward.

&gt; The location. This series shouldn't just be in one area of America, take it around the world, have them meet up with foreign ranger teams when fighting an enemy that is too powerful for one team to handle. 

That would be to expensive to keep doing every season, but they've traveled a few times. They also do meet other teams occasionally but that's expensive for the show to keep doing every few episodes.

&gt; Make the character proficient in a weapon that they then get as their ranger weapon, don't give the excuse that they gain knowledge on how to wield it from Zordon or the morphing grid or whatever. 

They do that, depending on the season of course. Sometimes the rangers already know what weapons they have or they learn to use them. Also it's not an excuse, that is what the powers do. It enhances the rangers skills and reflexes, what did you think the powers do? But it does help to actually know what your doing since they can only do so much, look at Ziggy.

&gt; Don't make them all go into Zords and straight into Megazord when the enemy gets big, maybe it has a weakness to the ranger weapons and so one of them has to ride on a Zord to hit it. 

They just did this in Ninja Steel, kinda. They had the rangers ride the zords on the outside and would hit them from the outside as well as with the zords.

&gt; Story. Actually have a story with developing friendships and human bullys or whatever within their own school or workplace. also, don't have the same cookie-cutter episodes the entire time. Have story driving episodes or ones where a ranger is sick, so they gave to get creative when missing a ranger and Zord 

They do this, did you just grow up with MMPR and never watch the show again and come here and saying ""Here's how to make the show good"" without actually watching anything? Or did you just watch Megaforce and assume that's things are because I wouldn't blame you. This depends on the season though since some are more story focused than others. Recently in Dino Charge you had the Kendal and Shelby stuff where at first Kendal just assumed she was nothing but a waiter and not really a Ranger. Dino Charge wasn't the most story focused but it has character development for certain characters who come in later that I won't give away. But The Kendal and Shelby stuff is just earlier in the season so I thought it would be fine to use an as example. But if you want an older example, Jack and Sky in Power Rangers SPD is probably the best conflict between rangers story.

&gt; The rangers. Don't just have teenagers, maybe have an adult office worker who can look after the team and lead properly. 

They know and have done this multiple times. Well they weren't office workers but they were working a cafe, pizza place, rescue professionals, Space Police Officers, Time Police Officers, a mix of a few jobs, didn't have jobs but weren't high schoolers and had stuff setup for them since it was a family responsibility, worked for a government organization. I think I covered them all but I might be forgetting a few.

&gt; Don't just reuse a theme from before. Create a new and interesting one. E.g. Super Megaforce. 

They have been, your ignoring them and you also want to bring back Alpha and Zordon. Pick one, do you want to have reused themes or not reused themes. Also Zordon is dead, he can't be brought back. Alpha is somewhere in a warehouse. 

So from another Power Rangers fan I think you just described SPD, Jungle Fury, RPM, Lightspeed Rescue, Time Force, and a few others.",1614556862

At the end of the day the movements are pretty well established and like it or not if you want to progress in the sport you're going to have to practice them.

The remaining 53% of victims lacked any burns at all. If we know where the BOR agents bodies were located, it could help determine if the munitions cooked off in the ground fires.

not from ikea

1x set of 6"" furniture legs from amazon  

2x legs from lowes

&amp;#x200B;

so while at ikea I had to call several audibles, they had no adlis legs in stock but I found 4 of them in the oopsie room, which necessitated the malm since hey had no alex in stock (wasn't planning on buying a drawer set), and when I realized it wasn't enough for stability i bought a couple of legs from Lowes along with some brackets to connect all the peices.... its damn stable which is shocking because I thought I was gonna have to buy even more legs after putting her all together, intially I had bought furniture legs from ikea (to raise off the malm for height) but grabbed the wrong size as I was in a rush to get out of there, so I had to order a set from amazon.

the lack side table was done because they had no other sizes of linmons in stock and my original idea was to use several burhult shelving units to make up the corner part but decided going with this end table was a better idea, plus its a little thicker than the linmons so it gives it a unique look IMO.

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","Embrace vulnerability!! i feel like my closest relationships growing up, there was never a chance to show vulnerability, my mom never shared when she was worried or sad, and neither did my dad. And I thought it was a strength to never allow people to see your weaknesses. But now  i find it so beautiful and refreshing when someone decides to share an insecurity or to acknowledge it rather than hide it. Being vulnerable brings me closer to people. But it's easy to mix it up with self deprecating jokes or over sharing. 

To not fall in those two, you first need to forgive yourself for messing up or whatever that has caused you shame. This might sound like BS but don't judge it till you try it, look in a mirror, or find a moment to be by yourself, tell your self from the bottom of your hart that ""it's ok if you make mistakes or or mess up in a conversation. That you still love yourself and you accept yourself."" You can write it, say it outloud look in a mirror hug yourself but it best works when you bring these thoughts into the physical world.
This sounds cheesy as fuck but  I've cried when I've done this because I didn't realize how harsh I had been to myself, how badly i needed self compassion. You must have tons of other strengths  or things you are proud off and you are define by those too, don't forget it, remind yourself of them.

Embracing vulnerability is also an honest apology to you or to someone you might have affected, don't over do it just acknowledge it, don't over share how bad you feel about yourself,it's not about you. just say you are sorry.

But I think what VivaSorte is saying is, from the perspective of ‚Äònormal‚Äô people. That ‚Äònormal‚Äô people often don‚Äôt understand child abuse. Like yknow how parents who don‚Äôt love each other won‚Äôt divorce because they want to look happy for their kids, but they actually just argue all the time and it doesn‚Äôt work out and seeing that actually damages the child more than the divorce would have? So common. 

Anyway I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs actually fine that my teachers did nothing, I think they‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs so common for ‚Äònormal‚Äô adults to totally misunderstand or turn away from anything that makes them feel uncomfortable. Its horrible and it needs to change and it makes me feel sick and I don‚Äôt understand it but, what can I say other than that ‚Äònormal people‚Äô can just really, really SUCK at helping abused children. I think if it did teach me anything it‚Äôs that if I were working with children or caring for them I would pick up on signs that something may not be right at home and do what‚Äôs right, and let the kid know someone‚Äôs on their side. I would do what these adults were too scared and cowardly to do for me.

Edit: Actually, looks like #356 went on sale on 2/25 for April 2021. So the date is right, #357 (May 2021) would go out on March 25th. Very curious to see where this goes.

Edit #2: Edge actually did the exact same thing prior to the Silksong issue, and it was more of a tease (not the final cover):

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","in the past (years ago) the 'desktop' was a special file manager window that was running on the lowest layer (right above the X servers root window) that could show icons and other things.    I am not sure how much this applies to mondern DE's - Gnome for example actually moved away from the file manager (nautilus) managing the desktop icons - and they are now managed by a gnome extension.

Years ago - i used 'rox filer' and the 'rox desktop' which used the rox filer as  the desktop manager.

I seem to recall using other programs to get icons on the desktop with other window managers such as fluxbox and so forth. This was back when 'desktop widgets' were the fun cool thing. 

Windowmaker - had 'icons' but they were not actually files in a directory setup. So more like 'smart' dynamic panels.

---------------------------------

And this is me rambling on a bit in my old age. :) 

KdE has an overlooked feature where each virtual desktop  can have its own layout of icons and even not be a normal desktop. or have other widgets and so forth. But i cant even recall what the features name is. I only toyed with it  - and never really used it.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Name - 
The elves of my world are generally called Hum elves due to a congenital lisp that produces a little 'hmm' sound when they talk softly, though it isn't very apparent when they shout. Other than that they're called elvens or elves plus the region or season they were born in. Ex/ Winter elves, vivill elves... 

Physical -
My elves are cat like, able to purr and trill (the reason they can purr is the reason they hum due to throat structure etc). Their abnormally huge eyes are cat like allowing night vision and superior sharpness, but they can't see most colors and are severly colorblind (colorblind type varies for groups). They are lithe and have fangs and serated claws, allowing great climbing and easy hunting (their main prey is birds and small mammals). They are diurnal (opposite of nocturnal) [the nightvision is vestigial as they came from more nocturnal ancestors, however some choose to become nocturnal due to religious or climate variables], hunt mainly in the morning and late afternoon, the gather berries and other materials in between. Their hair is silky and can be cut off and sold for a high price, pride prevents most from doing so.

Culture -
They place great pride in their hair as a people and most would die than have it chopped off, even though their hair can grow back quite fast. Other than that elves partake in various cultures along with other races and there is several elven kingdoms.

Personality-
Even if all are unique they share one blaring trait; they are all very overdramatic. It isn't really know why they all share this trait specifically, but some say thousands of years of being in the dark and then suddenly coming into light went straight to their head and something snapped.",1614556866

Mas √© uma amizade diferente, digamos assim, tem que limitar os assuntos, n√£o conv√©m sair falando de mulher, por exemplo, at√© acho que seria falta de respeito. 

Ent√£o √© praticamente imposs√≠vel encontrar o que ela procura em homem hetero, que seria um cara que ficaria um bom tempo junto com ela, sairia com ela com certa frequ√™ncia apenas pra conversar bem de boas. Se o cara √© homem hetero e convidar uma mulher pra algum programa, a menos que ele j√° tenha uma longa amizade e muito assunto pra falar, ele tem interesses e √© praticamente certo que ele espera mais que s√≥ conversar. E se ele n√£o se interessar pela mulher, vai arrumar alguma desculpa pra n√£o sair com ela. 

Se for pra bater um papo, √© mais prov√°vel que o homem hetero prefira ir num barzinho tomar uma ceva gelada com um amigo, eles teriam mais assuntos pra conversar e eventualmente falariam de assuntos que n√£o falariam com mulheres.

"Batch","t5_2sz7y","You could use 2-step batch files. The first changes registry settings under HKCU\Console, then calls itself a 2nd time in a new console window. Ideally, the 1st step would create a .REG file in which is stores the current settings from HKCU\Console, then changes settings, then calls itself in a new window.

The batch file could test for the presence of the restoring .REG file. If not found, the batch file would assume step 1. If found, the batch file would assume step 2. Step 2 should end with restoring the original registry settings and deleting the .REG file.

Are you open to taking the risks of messing with the registry?

If not, there's always BRUTE FORCE: create a .LNK shortcut with the intended console font, and run your batch file using that shortcut.",1614556867

I would think of zoning as being more defined. Some large buildings are often zoned as Area A, Area B, etc., (Area 1, Area 2...) and those areas encompass maybe a separation between podium and tower or in a hotel, maybe the ballrooms from the public areas. Fire separation is often a driver of how buildings are zoned. But zoning tends to be done much later in the process than a bubble diagram. Usually a bubble diagram is one of the first things produced in the concept phase just to get general adjacencies and spatial relationships worked out. I would place zoning as more of a schematic design type thing. You might run this question by an architect too because this type of thing tends to be out of the purview for ID (even though you should know it especially if you're doing commercial work).",1614556867

After you max CP, you want to maximize Control while still meeting enough craftsmanship for what you want to craft. Craftsmanship dictates how many synthesis actions are needed to complete your craft. There's no point to extra craftsmanship - that just becomes overkill when completing a craft.

You're going to want to find a melding guide for more detailed information about how to meld. I'll mention that I am at 2722/2822/554 as a non-specialist. This is with pentamelded tools (no relic).",1614556869

"TeenMomOGandTeenMom2","t5_3nsi0","Ugh. I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with her but glad you‚Äôve set boundaries &amp; don‚Äôt engage. I have a friend who I suspect has BPD (per my ex-bf who is a doctor) mixed with a xanex addict. The stuff I‚Äôve seen her do and the situations she‚Äôs put me in are WILD! Thankfully she‚Äôs 40 &amp; and no kids because I can‚Äôt imagine having a parent like that.

We‚Äôre currently on the outs because I suggested she get help (psychiatric &amp; substance). She thinks the issue is no one will accept the - bizarre &amp; downright scary - behavior as ‚Äújust who she is‚Äù and that she is not addicted to xanex she ‚Äúhas real anxiety‚Äù and xanex is the only medication that works for people with ‚Äòreal‚Äô anxiety so it‚Äôs ok to take xanex daily for a decade. 

Hard to help someone who refuses to accept any responsibility for their behavior and just demands people accept it. Feel for your stepson. Navigating life with a parent like that must be tough!",1614556870

‚ÄúFew atheists assert they have knowledge about the non-existence of God‚Äù

They don‚Äôt say it directly, they just say ‚Äúi reject the claim that there is a God.‚Äù That is just a fancy, non confrontational way of saying ‚Äúi believe that God doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù. That is a claim about something eternal and in their words ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù. Its a claim that you are saying we as human‚Äôs lack the capacity to take a stance on because we don‚Äôt fully understand it. Its a double standard.

"kratom","t5_2qx0h","Oh boy do they. I took methadone for pain for 18  years and started  Kratom to get off it then 3 months later had to go on it to stop restless legs caused by methadone. kind of puts your nerves to sleep and possibly does damage to them. I have to take kratom or I can't sleep at all. My feet and legs will drive me nuts. The doctor gave me 3  drugs to try to stop it and they all made it a lot worse so then I did some reading and found that kratom works for this too and hey I had some! I had them during the day too so I was taking a lot of kratom non-stop for over a year and my blood tests came back fine. Im now down to 2x at night, 7, and midnight and im fine. It did help my pain but I'm very active eat right and I  take a lot of vitamins and supplements that seem to have gotten my pain under control. The only break I have had from kratom was last year I couldn't walk for 8 months and was on pain meds for my foot. I had surgery to remove a little piece of bone on my joint ( yea that's all it was!)  and so I guess I had my 1st break from kratom. I had a lot of blood tests during the 8 months and my liver was always fine as were my kidneys. I had read kratom doesn't harm your organs and so far I have never read where anyone said that it did so I think he is fine. It's sure better than taking pain meds or booze and if you have to have something for pain kratom is a lot better for you than the alternative.",1614556871

"IFchildfree","t5_3011h","We struggle with this as a couple as well. It‚Äôs not just me, it‚Äôs both of us. For so long we were timing intercourse and now that that‚Äôs not happening it‚Äôs sort of like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the purpose‚Äù. It‚Äôs sad because in the beginning when we were dating when we were trying not to get pregnant (before we knew about the infertility) we were sex maniacs! But infertility killed that excitement. When literal doctors are telling you when to have (and not have) the most intimate part of your marriage it kills the flame. This affected my husband more than I thought it would and it‚Äôs just really hard for us to reconnect. My advice is to try and get your headspace out of the ovulation timing if you can. If it happens, it happens, and just enjoy it. Try everything in your power to not look at a ovulation calendar afterwards. Try to be more chill and relaxed. All easier said and done but getting back into the mindset of pre-infertility as you possibly can helps.",1614556872

Okay, a little background. I'm a full time actress in Bollywood, and I have worked in many hit productions all across Mumbai. But never in my life have I ever met a producer as vile as this one. 

He wrote a half baked fantasy story about him as a pirate defeating some sort of witch queen and assassin, and he even chose to take on one of the lead roles, playing as himself. If this does not sound ridiculous enough yet, he apparently stormed into the writer's room just a week ago to write in a scene himself. A kissing scene! Starring himself! And me!

This is really unethical! My contract, which I signed a month ago, said very clearly, no. kissing. scenes. So this producer just decided to violate my contract, and go against the wishes of the director and all the writers. The scene doesn't even make any sense! I can't go into too much details because I signed an NDA, but anyone who would see the scene would understand that there's no way my character would fall in love with someone so fast, especially not enough to kiss someone I barely met. 

And he is so disgusting. I could have done a simple handshake, a dance or a hug. Or even if I were to kiss any of the actors, I would rather...I don't know...the lead actor??? Or even any of the dancers? Just not him! He is so vile! The crew all agree that he always makes rude remarks at the female crew and dancers, and we all secretly hate him.

What's more, the director is too afraid to speak up against him because he's supposedly tied to some underground gangs, and she fears for her life. I am absolutely speechless! He's just using his mob power to force himself onto me!

I was so angry yesterday that I threw the only copy of the script into an elevator shaft and I'm pretending to forget my lines so hopefully the director will change the ending. God, I wish that horrible, horrible man would just disappear! I don't care about that man at all, but the director seems disappointed that her film will never see the light of day, and part of me feels bad for that. AITA?

Hey guys I think I'm kinda lost with the direction of the relationship of my boyfriend and I. 

To begin, me F/18 and He M/18 have met on Discord, and after a while we just started to go into love and now we were happily dating for almost 6 months.

Though, today took a strange turn. I wanted to talk to him over voice chat for the very first time, but he didn't show up. I was really confused and I'm now not sure about if it was my fault or if he's cheating on me with another girl. I really love him and I don't want to lose him to some other girl I don't know about. Please, can anyone teach me how to show him that I am serious about this relationship and that I really love him...‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense. There are roughly 4 different ideas in here that appear completely unrelated. 

1: Why would him not showing up on voice chat be your fault?

Why would you jump to him cheating on you because he didn‚Äôt show up for your voice chat?

Why are you concerned about losing him to another girl...you don‚Äôt know about...if you don‚Äôt know about her?

Why do you feel the need to show him that you are serious about the relationship, because he didn‚Äôt show up for voice chat?

I think you need to take a deep breath. Focus your thoughts on the issue at hand. And not let your fear, anxiety and insecurities run all over the place until you are no longer able to hold a conversation.",1614556876

According to albertas funeral services act general regulation a funeral service licensee can cremate a body with authorization from a person who the representative of the the funeral services business believes on reasonable grounds has authority to control the disposition of the dead human body. (This could be your step sister in legal terms) This requires legal forms if your step sibling went through the proper steps to obtain these which im assuming they did because to legally cremate or embalm we need those forms, then you really have no recourse. Check the regulations in your province, the industry is heavily regulated and we wont do anything to risk our licenses.

Its morally iffy frankly i wouldnt have worked with anyone other then the person i had the first call with, but thats not on the funeral home it would be on your sibling.

"gonewildaudio","t5_2u463","Alright. Lemme give this to you in the nicest way possible. This comment could have stopped at the first paragraph, second sentence, and it would have been completely fine. 

Unfortunately, that is not the case so let's just jump into it!

Firsly, let me ask you a couple of questions:

Did she make it personally for you? And did she ask for your feedback?

More than likely, the answer to both is no.

Now, I see that you had mostly good intentions with this post. While your comment may have had positive intentions to motivate and give praise to her audio, it kind of goes against your good intentions once you voice on what YOU want for her to do for her future content. 

In the future, please ask the creator if they want feedback from you. And I'd refrain from telling them what YOU want out of them. And don't kink-shame! If you don't like it, and can't say anything nice about it, it's best to say nothing at all! 

Also, if you made the effort to post a LITERAL ESSAY for this comment, as well as a REQUEST, I think it's high time you save up for an audio c\*mission or pay upfront. That or go to someone else who will make content that caters to you specifically. But that's just me.

"anime","t5_2qh22","**~~First time~~ viewer remembers Byston Poorly**

For the most part I look back on the first half of the show fondly. There were so many interesting aspects to the setting that were being explored like aura power, the Ferario, the different kingdoms and odd pocket realms hidden from humanity. Sure there were some things that weren't great like Elmelie's repeated failures to escape, but even those tended to expand the world a little more each time like when she encountered the Garou Ran that wanted to kidnap her. The war was escalating, new kingdoms rose up against Drake's advances as others fell. Occasionally Earth got involved with either new people summoned or others being temporarily sent there from Byston Well, and the interaction between the two was good.

And then Jacoba Aon, with all her power, sent all the aura machines to Earth. I was excited for that at the time! There was an entirely new battlefield to engage in, new players with the nations of the world getting involved, and a major opportunity to shake things up. And yet, very little happened after that point for a very long time. I know there was meddling at the production level that forced them to change things around and that's a large part of why we ended up with the extended skirmishes and no progression toward the end of the show. I still have to think they could have done *something* to make it more interesting in that stretch though.

Remember how Shot and Bishott were scheming behind Drake's back even after they came to Earth? None of that was relevant in the end and barely even mentioned outside of Muisy's complete failure of an assassination attempt. All the aura craft being too strong for conventional weaponry from the start meant the Earth factions could do little but sit and watch for the most part. There were a couple instances where they were relevant (the Soviet Trojan horse nuke, Paris and the follow-up from Britain and later Norway's brief riot) but we had maybe two or three scenes with American leadership and Drake wasn't even involved with those.

And that's all the stuff that *was* brought up in the back half of the show. There's a lot that wasn't like what was going on in Byston Well with everyone missing or anything related to the Ferario outside of the trio that we saw come over. The last third of the show felt like a lot of wasted opportunities. In the end I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth after an optimistic start, and the sudden rush to wrap everything up without any real sense of closure beyond the framing device as a whole didn't help that.

As always thanks to /u/Pixelsaber for hosting and everyone else for joining in. See you next time?",1614556878

"BettingPicks","t5_3c87z"," In the final match of the 25th round of the Spanish Example, Real Madrid will host Real Sociedad at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. The game will take place on March 1  


**Real Madrid**  


Despite the fact that Real Madrid have a nightmare of injuries, Zinedine Zidane's team continues to produce the desired results. ""Creamy"" won 5 matches in a row, and in the last four the team did not concede.  


Galacticos have won 4 consecutive times in Example. They defeated Huesca 2-1, Getafe 2-0, Valencia 2-0 and Valladolid 1-0. On February 24, Real Madrid put pressure on Atalanta and scored an important goal away in the 1/8 of the Champions League (1-0).  


In the standings of the Spanish championship, the team takes second place after Atl√©tico. The gap is only 3 points.  
**There are a lot of players in the infirmary. There are Azar, Benzema, Valverde, Marcelo, Carvajal, Militao, Ramos, Odriosola and Rodrigo.**  


**Real Sociedad**  


San Sebastians have failed in the Europa League, leaving the 1/16 of the tournament. The team lost 0: 4 to Man United in the first match and failed to do anything in the second (0: 0).  


In the Example, Real Sociedad is ranked 5th with 41 points. The guests approached this game with a series of 5 games without defeat.  


Real Sociedad defeated Alaves 4: 0 and Cadiz 4: 1 in previous matches, and also took points from Getafe (1: 0).  


The guests have injured Aritz Elustondo, Carlos Fernandez, Joseba Saldua and Mikel Merino.  


**Forecast and odds**  


For 1.90, Real is the favorite of the meeting. Real Sociedad gives 3.53. A draw in the match is estimated with odds of 3.25.  


Only one participant of the event scored in both teams in four previous matches. I recommend betting on ""Both will score: no"" for 2.0

How ironic that the amount is nothing yet they don't want to cause a stink at their job to continue earning said money. Keeling over to stay on corporate's good side to your detriment is the worst thing you can do. 

He broke and took your cup, your personal property that you paid for with your own hard earned money. It's a matter of principle and common decency that it *shouldn't* be an issue to ask him to recompensate you. 

If he fights you on having the opportunity to make things right then he has doubled down to be a lousy boss. You deserve respect regardless of your job title. 

Working for someone like that ensures that this may happen again in the future. What happens when they dock $5 off your paycheck each time? Are you going to not make a fuss to ""keep the peace"" because it's not ""that much""? 

At the end of the day, do what you feel is right for YOU. Thinking about what you could've done with regret a year from now is the worst. As long as you feel respected and at peace with your decision is all that matters. Overall, no manager or job is worth the disrespect if you stand up for yourself and they retaliate. NTA.",1614556879

But I can understand the new art style being jarring to most people. 

Jujitsu is also more a traditional shonen with a lot of fighting going on. AoT at times can transition to something completely different so you can find episodes in the anime to not use a ton of time and budget on.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm sorry that you're in this situation. I'm studying speech therapy, I'll be officially one next June, and have worked with children with autism who are low functioning. Being around them can be very difficult, especially due to all the screaming and not knowing what they want. Your pain is completely understandable.

I'm sure you have tried, but speech therapy helps a lot. Something that characterizes autism is both a lack of desire to communicate and a confusion as to how to communicate what they do want to express. Obviously, this isn't the case with all of them, but it is for many. Most children with autism are non verbal. This doesn't mean you can't work on it, a speech therapist tries to teach the child that communication is key to a better life, that it's pleasant and rewarding.

If it wasn‚Äôt my choice of surgery I was using to make myself feel crappy, it would be something else lol.

The easier recovery ( I was out walking my dog a week and a half after surgery), not having to dilate and having no interest in sex or relationships made it a no brainer decision for me, but even so, I checked again and again with myself that it was still what I wanted throughout my transition and right up to my surgery date.

In the end it‚Äôs a personal choice of course, good luck with it :)

Wait. I don't know much about their history, but I think I've heard/read that their history goes back like at least 5,000 years or something??  No? 

Also, people often refer to the Chinese ethnicity as Han Chinses. But from what I understand, Han Chinese is not an ethnicity. The 'Han' in 'Han Chinese' refers to the Han Dynasty and 'Han Chinese' means 'descendants of the Han Dynasty.' So, it's not an ethnicity but a cultural identity. NO?? 

And you sometimes see ignorant people saying the Chinese Han and the Korean Han are the same Han and therefore the Koreans and Chinese are the same ethnicity. 

But the two Han's are different letters.

The Chinese Han (Êº¢) means the Chinese are the descendants of the  Han (Êº¢) dynasty. The Chinese Han is not about ethnicity. It refers to the cultural identity of the Chinese, the Han Dynasty people. 

The Korean Han (Èüì) refers to the Koreans, the Korean ethnic group. It's about the Korean ethnicity. 

But the two letters' pronunciations are similar and both letters are written as 'Han' in English, so a lot of ignorant clueless people look at the English letter 'Han' and mistakenly think ""Oh, they are the same people.""",1614556881

Seattle and Vegas seem to be the two I hear the most. I'm down. Whatever gets basketball back to Seattle. I like Vegas too. It would be a destination city. Yeah there's the strip, but there are some nice suburbs in Vegas too. Nevada has no state income tax.

Vancouver would be interesting since the city seems to be in a better position for a team than they were 20+ years ago. Might have a problem recruiting FA's there.

San Diego could be a destination city (hell, it's my destination city), but does the NBA want a fifth NBA team in Cali? I kinda wish the Clippers would have moved down there, but I think they're building their own spot in Inglewood. The Lakers seem to be the dominant team in LA in terms of popularity.

Louisville: small market; would be overshadowed by the two college basketball programs weirdly.

Mexico City: I'm open to it, but I'm probably biased more than others due to my Mexican heritage. Would NBA players be willing to move to a new country where English isn't the dominant language.

Austin: Similar to San Diego (but no beach tho), does the NBA want a 4th team in Texas?

STL: declining in population. More of a baseball town; have to compete with the Blues for eyes from October to June.

Nashville: Tennessee has the Grizzlies. I don't know if basketball would be a big attraction for the city. They already have an NFL and NHL team. If anything, Nashville would probably want an MLB team.

Montreal/Quebec: Vancouver would probably get an NBA team before them.

Kansas City: I'm not opposed to it, since it would give the growing metro area a team, but it's already hard to get free agents interested in Midwestern cities like Minneapolis. The NBA team would probably be overshadowed by the Kansas Jayhawks basketball team.

Birmingham/Omaha: not a big enough market in a football heavy state.

Virginia Beach: Could it be a destination city? All I know is it's a military city.

Pitt: Great sports city. I see it on a lot of underrated gems lists in terms of American cities.

San Juan: You think STL, Memphis, and Birmingham are rough? Add all that on top of Spanish being the dominant language there. I don't know if they would be able to get FA's here.

Havana: muy interesante, but the NBA probably doesn't want the PR of bending over backwards for another communist country ran by a dictator.",1614556881

"OnlineDating","t5_2qpe9","As a girl, I can tell you she‚Äôs probably already stalked your social media or LinkedIn and knows exactly what you look like lol. So she must like what she sees.

Also, I dated a guy like you. He was probably the most handsome, smart and funny man I‚Äôve ever dated. But he had been overweight most of his life and was extremely insecure. So, even though I was so attracted to him, he believed he was a catfish and that I‚Äôd ‚Äúhate him‚Äù. Even on the first date, I immediately told him he hadn‚Äôt catfished me at all and he responded that he was still 10lbs overweight and what on earth was I doing on a date with him. He also said (in a jokey way), ‚ÄúHOW are you single? What‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù He just couldn‚Äôt understand how/why someone like me would ever be interested in someone like him. And it was upsetting. Ultimately, he rejected me and, to this day, I feel bad about that whole situation because I really think it could have worked if he hadn‚Äôt been so hard on himself. 

So I‚Äôd tell you not to judge this girl too early. Just because you don‚Äôt like what you see in the mirror, doesn‚Äôt mean she won‚Äôt. And when you are attracted to someone‚Äôs personality (and she obviously is if she‚Äôs talking to you all the time), they instantly become physically attractive to you. 

So don‚Äôt make negative comments about yourself when you see her. Exude confidence. Don‚Äôt behave as if you‚Äôre ashamed (even if you‚Äôre feeling all this on the inside). You haven‚Äôt tricked her. You‚Äôre just being you - the person she‚Äôs enjoyed speaking to every day. Have faith. Hope it goes well when you do meet.",1614556884

`Normally, two days would be a short time frame to put in for leave. But the diplomats seem like they want to push integration as soon as they can, so I think I can get it through, especially since it's at the invitation of the local leadership.`

`I'm excited to see what your world has to offer.`

`-Staff Sergeant Yi Sun-Shin, marine detachment, light cruiser Dragonshore`

&amp;#x200B;

`All right, I put the request through. Shouldn't take too long to approve, since they basically just have all the engineers sitting on their hands as it is.`

`So excited to go planetside. Never actually been to any Earth before, so everything should be a new experience for me. And I trust that you'll be a good guide. This'll be fun! Just as long as the vacarine you're also bringing along isn't too much of a wet blanket.`

`And I never got to actually thank you for helping me talk through some of my stuff. So thank you. I didn't know how much it weighed before until I let some of it go.`

`-Specialist Emily Bischoff, engineering detail, artillery platform Lucky Strike`

&amp;#x200B;

`Lead Researcher Tagakami,`

`This message concerns the requested leave put in by Specialist Emily Bischoff and Staff Sergeant Yi Sun-Shin, both of whom stated that your invitation was their reason for requesting leave.`

`Do you both confirm that this is true and consent to serving as their local guide for the duration of their leave? Reply to this message with your response.`

`-Aether Conclave diplomatic office`

&amp;#x200B;

(Vacarine is a contraction of ""vacuum marine"". People from Emily's world call marines that serve on spaceships vacarines to distinguish them from normal marines, who serve on wet navy ships. Sun-Shin's world was visited before space travel became common, so he still refers to himself as a marine.)",1614556885

If you really must for some reason you can put a pair of speakers next to each other. Not ideal but still better than a single speaker that you can't later add a second speaker too.

Replace your soundbar for your TV with an amp or receiver and a pair of speakers to use with both the TV and the turntable.

* Amp: [Tibo TI435AMP](https://www.richersounds.com/hi-fi/amplifiers-receivers/tibo-amp435.html). Has a optical digital input for your TV and an analog input for your turntable. Add a [phono stage preamp](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PROZOR-Preamplifier-Turntable-Controls-Interfaces/dp/B08FRDRGC2) if there is not one in the turntable.
* Speakers: [Wharfedale Diamond 9.0](https://www.richersounds.com/hi-fi/standmount-speakers/wharfedale-9-0-black.html), [Mordaunt Short M10](https://www.richersounds.com/hi-fi/standmount-speakers/mordaunt-short-m10-blk.html), or larger [Mordaunt Short M20](https://www.richersounds.com/hi-fi/standmount-speakers/mordaunt-short-speakers-per-pair.html) or larger and better very good [Wharfedale Diamond 220](https://www.richersounds.com/hi-fi/standmount-speakers/wharfedale-diamond-220-blk.html). Or the also very good [Q Acoustics 3020](https://www.richersounds.com/hi-fi/standmount-speakers/q-acoustics-q3020-matte-graphite.html) (¬£119 using voucher code FLASH30).

Or look for a used AV receiver and a pair of used speakers or new.

If you must have powered speakers with a digital amp, [TIBO Plus 3.1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Active-Bluetooth-Speakers-Control-Optical/dp/B07G9VQ5N7/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;keywords=tibo+speakers+4&amp;qid=1614556507&amp;sr=8-7).

However I don't understand nerfing COH runeword while tyreals got a buff.

Like do we even need more of a reason to NOT wear fort/coh/enigma and go straight tyreals instead of wasting currency on mediocre chest armors lol.

This just makes the disparity even worse.

Trang oul's fire mastery nerf was also not needed it didn't make any builds meta at all and allowed for some fun variations early ladder play. Making these fun alt builds even less viable just forces more players into meta builds lessening build diversity.

Nerf to cranium basher kinda kills the weapon for SS druids maybe add an extra 20% ias on it to make it viable again for druids but still less strong for WW barbs?

"Taxidermy","t5_2sj2g","That orange bottle solution isn't a true tan, it washes out and does not produce a quality tanned pelt at all. There are lots of ""easy"" shortcut products out there that claim to only need a soak or two, but unfortunately, cutting corners will only lead to lower quality results.

A true tan requires a pickle. This helps lock the hair into the skin, and kills off bacteria. At minimum, the pelt needs to be skinned, pickled, degreased in some way with a commercial degreaser (dawn typically isn't strong enough to penetrate into the skin, but some people do use it anyways, I just don't recommend it personally), neutralized, tanned, and broken.

[Here](https://m.facebook.com/nt/screen/?params=%7B%22note_id%22%3A275865813675686%7D&amp;path=%2Fnotes%2Fnote%2F&amp;refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fnotes%2Ftrubond-tanning-products-llc%2Ftanning-with-trubond-1000b%2F983563768346287%2F&amp;_rdr) is a link to one person's method with the Trubond series of products. Personally, since I don't mount my pelts and I can't stand a greasy pelt, my method is slightly different from this. I also flesh by hand, instead of with a shaver. It can be done, it just takes a lot longer!

My method is skin and place directly into the pickle (salt drying isn't necessary), let it stay for a day or so, remove and flesh throughly, return to the pickle, degrease, return to the pickle, assess greasiness and repeat degreasing as necessary, then neutralize, tan and oil. After that, the pelt needs to be stretched as it dries, so that the fibers dry supple, instead of stiff. 

While you're salt drying, you shouldnt roll up the pelt. It is incredibly important that it dries out quickly, otherwise bacteria can grow, and keeping it rolled up makes it take longer to dry.

Best of luck with your pelt!! Sorry for the huge message of information. Tanning can be a tricky process that takes a while, but really, nothing compares to producing a high quality tan yourself.",1614556887

"thebachelor","t5_2tj74","Continued......

I honestly feel that I‚Äôm just continuing to repeat myself and like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if any of these is helpful. I know that I‚Äôm someone who does the work and always will continue, not just for BIPOC, but for all people, Indigenous people, Mexican people, Asian people, Trans people, for fat people, for all of these things, for the LGBTQ community-which I am a part of. I will do the work because that‚Äôs who I am.

Even when I was in a place to be doing this work and rejecting my blackness I wanted to fight against it, but out of trauma response, out of safety, familiarity‚Ä¶ I didn't know how to. And this is not just, ‚Äúoh I grew up in the south and I wasn‚Äôt educated, which is also part of it, but it's also the fact that I have had to experience the absolute harm and trauma that is white supremacy, and that is what you see in those tweets. That‚Äôs what I had in myself. I no longer hate my blackness. I no longer care to have the false sense of safety of protecting whiteness. So absolutely I stand with my BIPOC community and sincerely hope you can accept me as being imperfect and always doing the work. Life long. Because I don‚Äôt think this shit is going anywhere anytime soon. I sincerely hope you see my passion, hear my truth.

"Retconned","t5_3fft0","""Anybody feel"" posts are becoming a too-common sight on this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

There will always be *someone* who feels, and those who don't rarely bother to post because such posts are typically unwelcome in a thread being viewed by people primed to agree. You just get down voted, and that's never fun.

&amp;#x200B;

As it so happens though... I sort of do feel. At least, I have a sense of being on edge and there is no good reason for it. I have felt in the last few months like the things I normally stress about are very soon not going to matter, and I should just relax and try to just be ""okay"" in the time I have left.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER...

&amp;#x200B;

There is a worldwide global pandemic going on that happens to be very serious. I've been under lockdown for almost a full year now it seems. The media is bombarding us 24/7 with unrelenting stress messages. The MSM has become that crazy guy on the street corner with the sign saying ""The End Is Coming!"". So of course we are all, collectively, in dark place emotionally even if we don't realize it. Even those of us who like to think we are far enough along to shrug off the subliminal suggestions, because they have been constant.

He's become defined by the IC belt that he loathes, that denied him his first shot at a WK main event by who was holding it-in fact, the real story in this match wasn't Ibushi vs. Naito, it was Naito vs. the IC belt that he wanted to kill.

Like someone below said, Naito doesn't *need* to have a reign with a dozen defenses over hundreds of days. He's insanely popular. He doesn't lose heat when he loses.

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","I think you are sleeping a bit on Beasts. For a lot of factions the summonable Terror-causing manticore can be a great investment. Flock of Doom doesen't do much damage on it's own but it can easily hit half an army with some blob-management and is cheap (it's especially noticeable on Teclis, who can rack up an insane amount of damage from it) Amber Spear is actually one of the better missile spells (note: Missile spells are not good) 

Lore of Stealth's stationary vortex is also decent. 

Lore of Death is generally overpriced, yeah, it can still have uses in leadership bombs, and if you can stack some decent cost reduction or WOM cost it can be decent for the old stuff, but it has been nerfed a bit too much.

Nehekhara is... very meh. OTOH it has a bunch of cheap spammable spells you can use to trigger the Lore Attribute, which isn't nothing. But none of the spells stand out, the buffs are mostly single-target, and the damage spells are very mediocre.

Dark is one of those lores where most of the lore is kinda  meh, but then it has the super-amazing Soulstealer. I would almost never use it on a Sorceress, but on Malekith and Morathi (who are both competent fighters) it's amazing.

High Magic has some cheap spammable spells for triggering the lore attribute, and some expensive, generally situational spells. Unmaking and Tempest are both great for when dealing with very specific threats and completely useless outside of that narrow scenario. Since the buff I've actually found the Phoenix spell to do fairly good work. 

Deep isn't a bad lore, it just competes with Vampires.

I would also note that any AOE buff/debuff spell is probably at least worth looking at, and I have a fondness for armour-debuffing spells in particular. Especially early on when you're stuck with crappy missile weapons debuffing enemy armour can make a significant difference.

I am actually not terribly enthused with fire, yeah, Burning Head is good, but neither Piercing Bolts nor Flamestorm I've found to be particularly useful. 

For Shadows Melkoth's is decent but the main use is the slow: Very useful when trying to catch enemy cavalry. Any spell that has a slow attached is at least vaguely useful, honestly.

The LD-affecting spells are also a bit tricky to use but can be amazing when used right: The problem with them is that if you use them at the right moment (IE: when they make up the difference between the enemy going below 0 LD or not) they can be absolutely amazing, but they do nothing if that doesen't happen. But getting an enemy to route (especailly if you have cavalry nearby) can be completely essential.",1614556888

Please remember your worth!! Don‚Äôt let your BPD brain - or him, for that matter - tell you that you‚Äôre being irrational, or that you need him to exist. You don‚Äôt!

Think about how much has changed in that two years. About how many people you‚Äôve met, friends you‚Äôve made, communities you‚Äôve found, self awareness you‚Äôve built. And then think about two years FROM now, where you want to be. Think about how much can change in that time. Do you still want to be carrying around his baggage?

Or would you rather be stronger, more fulfilled, maybe even having met someone who doesn‚Äôt abuse your trust in this way?

"LeopardsAteMyFace","t5_3jp3p","How do you come to the conclusion that I want people to starve &amp; die? I point that out because kind of like you're doing now, people often question others for questioning our social programs and what they're doing versus what they should be doing for people. The structure of our current social programs are poorly implemented, as I mentioned in another reply...many are penalized for actually trying to better their situation. In general, our social programs can be crippling in the long run. And  the current democratic party just wants to throw more money at the issue...when that isn't what actually needs be done. Democrats are not as good at helping less fortunate Americans as we all pretend or think they are...largely because many of them are simply so out of touch and don't understand why people are where they are in the first place.

Over the past few years I've really gotten into actually READING bill proposals and at times, Republicans ask for reasonable and sensible changes...but it just leads to finger pointing, blame games and nothing being done to pass effective and efficient legislation.

I feel the media along with politicians themselves are very well calculated in the words they speak, both liberal and conservatives like to try and lead us all to believe that one party is always right and the other is always wrong. If people actually cared and educated themselves, we'd see a lot more Americans hanging around the ""center"" area. The world isn't so black &amp; white, or red &amp; blue in this matter. They can both be full of it.

I'll end by asking that you don't pretend as if you know what kind of person I am. I'm not a conservative, and I'm certainly not worried about taxes...in fact I voluntarily give all year long to help the less fortunate.",1614556889
"movies","t5_2qh3s","A great example are 80‚Äôs movies. The Outsiders is an example of this. I remember we read the book in 8th grade like 13 years ago. And our teacher wanted to show us the movie.

But she was able to find a copy of the film that was old enough to say PG-13, so she didn‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of getting permission from our parents to put on an r rated film.

Edit: typo

Edit 2: I looked it up to be sure. I am wrong. It‚Äôs a PG-13 movie now, but came out as PG. And I was assuming my middle school wasn‚Äôt so strict to stop PG-13 films, even though your typically around 13-14 in 8th grade, but I guess my school was that strict.",1614556889

&gt; I think Berkshire is selling AAPL as fast as it can without moving the market

Let's assume you're right.

1. Goal #1: BRK want to dump APPLE as ""fast"" as it can, and

2. Goal #2: BRK doesn't want to move the market. 

As of today: 

1. BRK is moving slower than the pace that Apple is repurchasing shares (keep in mind Apple is going to go faster shortly), and

2. BRK is in no way, at their current pace, close to impacting the average volume for Apple. Nowhere close. I am not going to debate this with you; they're not.

"canadawhisky","t5_34k59","Evening! Finally getting caught up on emails, thought I‚Äôd pop on here to answer your questions, and point to a few things on our site for review.

Okay, so first-off, we‚Äôre a licensed AGCO agency. That means we are legally allowed to import spirits from our partners from across Canada, the USA, the UK and our rum even comes from Australia.

As far as our offerings, we‚Äôre definitely whisky-focused, but aren‚Äôt restricted to only whiskies. We also carry gins, vodkas, rum, etc. Our partners can be seen and researched here: https://www.whiskyquarterlyontario.com/exclusive-distillery-partners/ We were thrilled that Two Brewers and Devine Distillery both recently won a number of awards from the Canadian Whisky Awards.

General price points are completely dependent on what, from where, and quantity. As mentioned above, we‚Äôre licensed to bring in via the LCBO systems, as more Members join up, more order, the one thing that adjusts in pricing is freight rate. On all the product pages, accessible from the Distillery pages, we provide a ballpark, per bottle cost of the estimated landed costs for product. We have seen some fluctuations for sure, but seems to be in the relative range so a Member is not caught off guard. As we can‚Äôt modify the pricing, again, LCBO rules, the good news is you pay exactly what the LCBO charges me.

To do all of this, we operate under a Membership model. It takes an immense amount of time, energy (and patience being the LCBO) to facilitate orders to bring in craft spirits for Members. Details about that can be found here: https://www.whiskyquarterlyontario.com/membership/

Finally, our FAQ addresses some of the core questions others have had, however, glad to answer anything else as well. https://www.whiskyquarterlyontario.com/frequently-asked-questions/

Hope this helps, cheers!",1614556890

However our attack was a little shakier, we had two tries denied with a forward pass call (something we can clean up), and other than the Luai try we looked a bit flat attacking within the opposition 20

I still think attacking footy is our worst part of the game (its not bad just not as good as the rest), we dominate on coming out of our own half, kicking and defending, just the attack even last year could improve.

For anyone who didn't see the game, I watched every trial and (bias aside) it was the most impressive game IMO, both Eels and Penrith looked good, were defending well and the intensity of the game was nuts.",1614556893

But if my law is no stealing, and I know the only way most people are going to steal in order to survive, why even make it a law in the first place?

Im not complaining that she doesn't do anything more after level up, im complaining that there isn't any reason to level her up since essentially there isn't any requirement.

Then tape that up to the window and tape your fabric overtop. Trace the pattern on the fabric with the fabric marker. You can use a damp q-tip if you make any mistakes. 

For me personally, I think I would do everything outlined with black thread and a simple back stitch. Then for the sweaters, you could use some fun colors to make it pop. Also using some French knots or other textured stitches would be beautiful on the sweaters!

You then get generally more professionalism in how subs like r/NintendoSwitch and r/PS5 are curated, even having nice CSS banners, etc.

The fact that any of us are here on the XSX sub at all which is currently at 500k users is a feat in and of itself and is despite MS‚Äôs abysmal naming and branding efforts when it comes to that. There‚Äôs about as much news about all the consoles but it isn‚Äôt really curated to be on the front page here. Most all games on the new consoles are the same, and there aren‚Äôt many new games for either of them in terms of exclusives. Both consoles are currently riding on backwards compatibility on top of that. You‚Äôre also bound to get more PS5 folks posting here because of console wars. If there are more PS5 folks on Reddit in a more engaging sub, they‚Äôre going to be posting more than the XSX folks.

I‚Äôd also wager more people that got an XSX are just playing the XSX. If you have Game Pass, it‚Äôs a fairly seamless unlimited nearly free instant gaming situation. If you‚Äôre looking for something else to play, Game Pass covers that for you too. With load times also basically being gone and fast game switching, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in there. If something‚Äôs on Game Pass there‚Äôs not much point in talking about it because you can just try it and even have it download by hitting a button on your phone.

Living with a room mate is not the same as sharing a living space with your other half. There are different things to consider. When we 'own' things we don't realise how many things we do own and how they spill out into other places.

The reason your room mate didn't spend time in the living room was probably because it was so full of your stuff. It didn't have to be personal (like pictures) but it was still yours. That was I can see why she felt confined to her room. And this has been going on for a while so the resentment built up.

If you've asked her not to tell you when she misgenders you in her head (her doing that very well could be a whole issue of it's own, I won't assume) and she still does it, it's a problem.

And dude, her going through a lot doesn't mean it's okay for her to be misgendering you. Maybe it means that the conversations with the two of you on this have to be less often or less intense, or maybe even more often and more intense because that totally depends on the both of you, but that's about it.

I (F26) asked my fianc√© (M26) to wait until after our wedding to get his hand tattooed. For context, he has multiple tattoos, one on his back a full sleeve and more on his chest. I don‚Äôt have any tattoos or want any tattoos. Our wedding is dated for August 2022. He wants to get a tattoo of an octopus on his hand. There is no sentimental reasoning or attachment to an octopus, he just thinks it looks cool. He thinks I‚Äôm being unreasonable for asking him to wait. To be clear I didn‚Äôt ask him to not get it, but just to wait. AITA?

"nevillegoddardsp","t5_wipia","Had a breakthrough one day after a meditation that made me realise that life was just a dream and there was nothing ever to be worried about. The past? Doesn‚Äôt exist except for your imagination, and since you constantly play it out in your imagination it then reoccurs in your 3d = present moment. 

To be honest, Neville‚Äôs work is hard to grasp at first no matter what anyone tells you because it involves a radical change in conscious, yes it is about your desires but it‚Äôs more important about knowing you are God, which is what we are never taught - we are taught that God is always outside of us. On top of that, our imagination is more real then reality, which is completely life changing. 

For me I realised that by getting your desires - for you which is your sp, is coming from the place of knowing you are God. And what affects God? Nothing. That‚Äôs why the Bible constantly states, ""Be still and know that I am God"". Because that‚Äôs all that matters. Once you have the solid foundation that you are God, and your imagination is more real then reality then you‚Äôve completed the test, everything you could desire and fathom is yours - anything you can imagine exists right now within you.",1614556897

"DestructiveReaders","t5_2z15u","Hey, really appreciate the feedback as always! And thanks for slogging through even if it's not your genre.

Can't find anything I strongly disagree with here, tbh. The unbalanced length with the first part is probably because I wrote that one long before the two following parts, and didn't know what the length or the main plot would be at that point. You're right that we spend a lot of time with Kaishka for someone who doesn't show up again. Speaking of Kaishka...

&gt;Kaishka and Tilnin are fine. However Yeklenka, Chivrenki and Prasutarov all made me stumble.

Funny you say that, since ""Kaishka"" is the one name that makes me trip over my keyboard every time. :P

&gt;‚Äúerr it‚Äôs kinda shit I guess, but is what it is, I‚Äôm just doing my job lol‚Äù-mentality.

There's noir for you. :)

That said, I know that's not an excuse for making him overly passive or lacking in agency, by all means.

&gt;I did not like the namedrop towards the end. It bothered me early on that we never got the fathers name.

Yeah, I can see that. At first I wanted to avoid his name as a sort of running gag, to show how little Tilnin cares about him. Then I decided to lean more into the ""true name"" thing, so it felt like giving it before it's important would undermine that moment. But maybe it's better to have it up front on balance.

&gt;I assumed he was an orphan or something because it sounded like Yeklenka  raised him, but apparently not? Since he mentions his dad.

No, he only spent a lot of time at her place. I'll admit I haven't worked out all the details yet, but he's partially based on an older character of mine with this same dynamic.

In any case, this story was a bit of a departure/change of pace for me, and I'm happy it worked as well is it did overall, haha. Again, appreciate the read! (And with this out of the way I should hopefully get the final push done on a certain other project soon...)",1614556897

"IndustrialDesign","t5_2qiv5","I call it "" term erosion"" I have watched this take hold over the past 20 years. I say to people A plumber will still be a plumber in 100 years. As to why? This has come from silicon Valley deciding that the term ""product designer"" was not already taken by people like me. That has to be due to the prevalence of ""industrial designer"" as a term in the US. And then how much silicon Valley companies have dominated language around the world. Simple answer is arrogant app development giants think all products are digital, because they forgot the chair , the desk , the keyboard , the mouse they used while developing the app was designed by real product designers. Honestly I was impressed all of you feel the same way. I say they should be called digital product designers and we can retain product designers.  Its ridiculous, however language does constantly evolve. But the plumber isn't worried.. not identical but I see the term ""prototyping"" is dominated by digital prototyping results almost nothing on physical prototyping. It has to be perverse if you have to specify something is physical but no longer need to specify if something is digital. That surely is a fundamental corruption of how we see the world.",1614556898

"RocketLeagueSchool","t5_3997e","A few notes:

I suppose it depends on your definition of ‚Äúmuch more‚Äù but the MMR you gain and lose at the beginning of a season isn‚Äôt inflated all that much. Instead of 9 MMR, perhaps your first name will be worth double that, tops (probably less) and the average game over the first 10 will probably be worth around 15, which is back to normal by game 20 or so. I wouldn‚Äôt consider a max or 18 a lot, but I‚Äôm sure many people would.

&gt;If you win about half of the games it doesn‚Äôt effect your rank at all.

That‚Äôs not true anymore. Well, it is and it isn‚Äôt, the different being that our ranks are altered at the start of each season now where seasons 3-14 they were not, so you have a different starting spot than you ended now, and winning half of the first 10 games will place you around that same rank, but not the same rank you left off at. If you‚Äôre above gold 3 or so, you‚Äôll start lower (the closer to gold 3, the closer to your ending rank) and vice versus on the lower side where you actually get a rank boost.

The catchup mechanic you refer to is only really active if there‚Äôs a significant rank difference (3 or so ranks, in my experience). Once you close that gap, there really isn‚Äôt any catchup mechanic in place, unless it‚Äôs so negligible it‚Äôs not worth mentioning.",1614556899

Ricardo is just bad and is a relic of a time long pass. His skill cooldowns are just way too long. It is a shame considering how cool this undying grandpa is with his actual jojo SW.

Sonia sits in the benchwarming table wondering when will she ever bloom like Shakmeh or Phillop who are both DPS HP PVP tanks but provide powerful and competitive PvE utility.

Demia is PvP-only and still hyper niche due to her lack of a quick cleanse. Her comp almost necessitates needing Rephy and using Rephy instead of FFrey or Evan sucks. 4 mana to pull in two targets as a night is a sad joke when we get characters like Maria, cain, Lorraine who all do the CC job better.

Aselica only wins by virtue of lack of competition but the uptimes on her buffs aside from S2 is just sad. S3 is such a feel bad skill and so is her SW.

Dosarta. Imagine investing in Dosarta. That's a good joke. Yes, I do like using my ""They picked Loman before I can in LoH, so I guess I will get Dosarta."" character.",1614556899

Many fall into logical error by equating governmental functions like defence and law enforcement with market and therefore thinking that like market is better for providing bread, planes, computers etc etc etc then it would also be better for providing defence. But according to libertarianism itself government and market are totally different because former uses force while latter is voluntary.   
Erroneous equating makes  them to think that there's no need for army and small companies could provide defence and there's no need for integrated defence and law enforcement. And they take for granted that there would be ""market"" of defence without government.  
Murray Rothbard wrote that he became anarcho-capitalist because someone asked him like ""if market is so cool then why not polie and army are private"" and he didnt find the answer.  
So my idea is- show them that   
1) isocockism is against libertarian principles  
2) therefore economy should be decentralised and defence integrated  
3) out of libertarian classics only goddamn Rothbard was anarchist, Hayek supported Reagan's defence budget increasing and Milton supported war on terror.",1614556899

"GME","t5_2u6vg","I would like to comment on my behalf, because this was posted not too long after my own submission (which this sounds like it's referring to).

I pointed out more than one group of users in my initial post. Those with critical thinking and skepticism and those who are of the ""anyone who criticizes me is a shill!"" group. I didn't discredit the sub as a ""whole.""

The latter individuals is who I'm referring to in my post, and from my perspective, they are dangerous. No one is against having fun. But I feel as if maybe you saw the ""emotion and vitriol"" in my post and completely glossed over the point of my entire argument.

You appear to me to be a well thought out individual, but there ARE those who are getting a little too close to ""hive mind"" for comfort. No one is criticizing the ""culture"" of r/GME, which is ""buy and hold,"" but a select few are being very vocal and critical of the mob/herd/cult-like minded individuals. Because honestly? Someone has to be. It's gone unchecked for far too long for my comfort and probably many others.

Maybe there 72,657 better ways that I could have handled it, but the posts that I've seen that were critical of these individuals always end up heavily downvoted to where it gets no visibility and these posts that say ""SHILLS ARE AMONGST US!!"" are all the way at the top. Please tell me you can see why this draws parallels to certain... *groups*.

Because I do, and it's not only unhealthy, but scary. They denounce anyone who disagrees with them. And I didn't even post anything critical of the math or fundamentals of GME and the price in that post, I criticized the absurd individuals in this sub who eat this stuff up like it's the word of god himself, and given the response to it, I can tell that I genuinely hit a nerve.

"Higurashinonakakoroni","t5_2vjs4","Its hard to even say that Rika is even at fault since its been explicitly shown that Satoko is the one who actively rejects Rika out of pride. Unfortunate for Satoko's case, but her misery is mostly in this aspect self initiated. Imagine what would people say if instead, Rika ignored Satoko's rejection of help and forced her kindness onto her, and the humiliation that Satoko experienced made her snap. Those who defend Satoko's actions would then say its Rika's fault once again for ignoring Satoko and not giving her the space she requested for. Only if the circumstances was that Satoko reached out for help and Rika ignored her, then would there be fault on both parties' end.",1614556900

**Haggard**

I really really recommend checking Haggard out. Their music is absolutely wonderful.

Haggard often sing in both English and German, often combining both in their tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Xandria**

I really love Xandria's newer albums from the time Dianna Van Giersbergen was their vocalist, as well as their one album from the time Manuela Kraller was their vocalist. So basically, their last 3 albums; those 3 albums are magical, and if you like Nightwish's older tracks from the time Tarja was a member of Nightwish, you will like those. So checkout their albums

* Neverworld's End (this is the album from when Manuela was their vocalist)
* Sacrificium
* Theater of Dimensions (my favorite Xandria album).

Unfortunately, none of these albums are in German; they are all in English, but Xandria is a German band, so I thought it would fit here, and these albums are really really good. Given the bands you listed, I imagine you will like these.

Their older work was also good, but it's not my favorite symphonic metal

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\m/

&amp;#x200B;

As a side-note: if you find Dianna Van Giersberg's work in Xandria good, check out the dutch band Ex-Libris; a symphonic progressive metal band where she is the vocalist. I included this in the end here because Ex-Libris is a Dutch band, not a German band, which is not what you asked for.",1614556900

Look for something that creates a good phone standard like something made out of Lego or K'nex or something. Lighting can be done with white screens (perhaps made out of paper) to bounce some light back to the face without it being overly bright. There are online sessions that show no faces at all. The most important part of a video is sound because stuttering video doesn't bother as much as stuttering audio.

2. A Bard is a jack-of-all-trades. It will never be the best at anything except being [a Bard](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCAcademy/comments/ap6obn/how_to_play_a_bard/). The Valor Bard can work as a bolstering somewhat tanky Bard. If you have a lot of buffing/healing spells that can help yourself you can stay in a fight quite well. There might be some need for more armor and Constitution, though. Charisma doesn't need to be super high for healing spells.

You can still use Arcana for magical things. Let the History be done with the History buff. There are two high-Wisdom characters in the group, so you can expect them to get those kinds of skills right and you're better off attempting Charisma skills.

Is the world outside of our world an expanse of dirt? A continuation of our ‚Äúdirt‚Äù with our dome being one of many? This seems unlikely. So what would be under the dome? What is underneath us? These are the questions I have asked. I subscribe to the idea of ‚Äúas above so below‚Äù so I suspect whatever container is above us is also below us. Yin and yang. Ones and zeros. To me it is the most logical answer. In this idea, it is easily possible that other ‚Äúparallel universes‚Äù exist. ‚ÄúBubble universe theory‚Äù but the universes are smaller. 

It is also possible this way that there is no ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù but a macroverse and a microverse. Different dimensions, if you will. Those are my thoughts. My speculations.",1614556901

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","I checked one of your songs ""Days"", and it's loud and pretty punchy. Nothing significant wrong with your kick.

My favorite comparison to make is Deadmau5 Strobe. When you compare your song ""days"" (as I do mine), vs strobe, you'd think, holy shit Deadmau5 is a magician. He's just too good. But then make both mono, and BAM, wtf happened? both songs seem like they're on the same level. So it's actually the stereo field that gives so much perceived volume and power, and that is what deadmau5 is very good at. Deadmau5's bass is even stereo as hell in Strobe. Of course not sub bass.

Here is version with more stereo information: [https://vocaroo.com/17r5NeX8qb9G](https://vocaroo.com/17r5NeX8qb9G)

Moreover, using only his own skills, leaked SHIELD data from Black Widow, and patience, he actually managed to shatter the Avengers. He absolutely won at his objective, something that can only really be otherwise claimed by Thanos himself. 

I‚Äôd be very interested in seeing more scheming from him. Maybe he‚Äôll turn up in Falcon and Winter Soldier series? Seems like the right place to put him pulling strings in the background.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","Its bullshit. I mean, there are differences between 'likes' and 'lites', but the distinction came about AFTER the term 'roguelike' was being used for BoI and others for a few years.

I just feel like its pedantic to bust out 'well akshually' over this shit. Been playing BoI since the flash version, I feel like most of us get what's going on despite there being no official demarcation between the two.

IMO, rogue-like implies a fuller implementation of mechanics from the old rogue-style games, random maps, items. But also it often implies the 1-1 you-move-they-move systems like in crypt of the necrodancer or dungeons of dredmor.

Rogue-lites on the other hand often have more action-game roots complemented by deep progression systems from run to run.

But there's a huge amount of overlap and cross-pollination from other genres. Is FTL a rogue-like/lite? It has some of the trappings but not others. There's this rush to claim any game with 'sitting sitting completion' and decent replay value a rogue-like/lite these days.",1614556903

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","If V+ is something that improves the game without necessarily changing the original feeling (like buffing an underpowered build a bit or tweaking how spells work) then V++ is to say fuck all that and overhaul shit completely.

Mods that adjust the spells or perks without dramatically changing most of them (Vokrii/Adamant) are generally seen as V+. Mods that add tons of new perks or change existing ones in dramatic ways, often in ways the original game never did, is V+ (Ordinator).

Overhaul mods and extreme gameplay mods are often V++, too. I'd argue any dodge mod, for example (particularly anything that gives the enemy the ability to dodge) is V++, because it fundamentally changes the way combat can feel.

I'd say the terms are relatively loose. If you feel at any point something changes the game to where it no longer feels like the original vanilla experience, then you could say it's V++. It's my personal preferred modding method, because most of vanilla Skyrim is shallow as fuck and needs far more help than a few tweaks.",1614556904

I know my colleague is struggling with small class sizes (4 kids in a CHOIR class!), and has had to get really creative. You could try having them sing for only a part of class, but really try embracing the other standards too, like creating music or connecting it to other areas. I don‚Äôt know how long your class is, but definitely have frequent breaks between singing activities (which should still happen. It is a choir after all) and other music activities.

I can totally get behind saying Cade and Mobley are the two most impressive/intriguing basketball players currently, but the reason I have at least the two G League kids up there with them is because its easy to see how their work ethic and coachability can lead to them ""catching up"" to those two or even being better.

I also think there are very real concerns about Mobley's motor/approach to the game that redditors seem to just dismiss. Theres no reason that he shouldnt be putting up better numbers than Okongwu did last year for example, but yet the production is identical basically. One guy is markedly more skilled, talented, and significantly longer, but the other guy just has a more ferocious motor and infectious energy.

With regards to the blocking of selling. Is it more likely they could block buying and selling at the same time? One of the biggest things they got flak for when they restricted buys was that if people could only sell, then the price could only be driven down (at least in terms of the traffic from those specific brokers anyway). If they stop the selling of GME as well as the buying, they open up the opportunity to hide behind the claim that they did not contribute to the price movements like they did last time. This partly comes from a selfish point of view for myself because I use Trading 212, which is non-commission and usually seen as the closest we have to Robinhood in the UK. Therefore, they do not make any money from the regular trades people make and their money comes from elsewhere - I believe T212 make their money from their CFD platform. This also means they do not lose any money from restricting a stock. 

No-Commission Brokers obviously only represent a (probably comparatively small) portion of the people involved in this though, I admit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also think that this time, moves out of spite are not entirely unlikely(?). I say that because the Hedge Funds shorting GME were directly insulted and challenged by many of the retail market, and to them their reputation is second only to their profits. Their reputation is what gets people on side and pumping money into their fund, and I don't think they would stand to let themselves be humiliated by a group of self professed retards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, thanks for the help.",1614556906

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;God doesn't need anything by definition - but that's not the same as saying 'God doesn't care'.

If you're a Christian and believe God is omni-everything, then this statement is hard to believe.

God knows the outcome of every single person's life before it happens. He already knows who will be indoctrinated into Christianity, who will be indoctrinated into other religions, who will convert, who will remain agnostic, who will reject him and who will never even hear about him.

He also knows that most people maintain belief in whatever religion they happen to be indoctrinated in, and he knows that many people face barriers and repercussions (sometimes severe) for converting from other religions.

In other words, a person brought up in a Catholic family and taken to Mass each week, will have an enormous advantage over say a young female living in a village in Taliban rule Afghanistan - who is brought up under Islam and with little rights - might face threats to her life if she converted.

A caring God would surely 'level the playing field' to give all of his creation the same opportunity. He could easily do this and maintain free will as well.

Yet, this is all foretold to him, and he choses to take no action.",1614556906

"Maplestory","t5_2rrdo","I think after this apology there has to be follow through with the action.

GMS has said ""we're going to be more transparent"" yet has not been anymore more transparent than before e.g [https://maplestory.nexon.net/news/64884/maple-memo-new-year-update-january-25](https://maplestory.nexon.net/news/64884/maple-memo-new-year-update-january-25)

I think that we as the player base should be more vocal now than ever about things that we want fixed or addressed for both KMS users and GMS users.

For example as a GMS player we should:  
Ask for the real reason the fairy heart was removed form the awake shop, the reason for frenzy totem removal from marvel machine, the reason they're not brining back potential-able badges (senogku high).

We should ask for better availability of Totems for both reboot and non-reboot players.

We should emphasis that our version of the game is very different to KMS and so that balance changes that affect our game differently should be addressed differently. E.g Gollux change, TB change etc...

Ironically this lack of communication and development inertia has not only led to this issue but has led many missed opportunities for increased revenue from the game. An example of this would be if they brought back frenzy in marvel machine or sengoku high (while allowing additional runs to be bought in both reg and reboot).

These are events/items the players **WANT** and we would **SPEND** for. Yet they decided to implement things like magic wagon v2 which is hated by the majority of the community. The development team is out of touch completely with what players what and this is only going to continue to lead to further issues down the line and missed opportunities for Nexon to make additional revenue from one of its strongest IPs.

Again, if they're serious about this apology then **REAL** action needs to be taken to make changes that restore the players faith in Nexon.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","&gt; tribal cultures being ruled fairly evenly between women and men 

How do we know that this existed? Writing wasn't even invented in the relevant period...

&gt; to being led by exclusively men 

So...when exactly did this happen? The absolute monarchy system wasn't exclusive to men. Cleopatra was absolute monarch in Egypt and not the only female ruler in antiquity (post the discovery of agriculture). Greeks and Romans also had female rulers.

&gt; So this is a commonly misunderstood thing that I probably should link your question to [r/askhistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/) post, but basically all female rulers were actually given rule by a council of men. Every queen in history that you thought ""They did whatever they wanted!"", in fact men were the ones making the actual decisions. If you google some examples that we know of, it'll blow your mind. It's one of the weirder aspects of history. 

Feel free to link the post. It's true that most absolute monarchies would have some kind of advisory council, but that is equally true for male and female rulers. I have no doubt that sometimes those councils would, in effect, run the country. That happened with male and female rulers (particularly where the ruler was a child, sickly or generally weak). That being said, there were plenty of strong female rulers who ruled competently in their own right.

So I return to my original question - when and where did the patriarchy exist?

Additionally, how is patriarchy, as a system (if you can call it that) 'objectively bad' (as you claimed)? How is it different to matriarchy as a system (this was the real purpose of my earlier question)? Is it just the identity of the ruler? Others in charge? Or is there a functional difference in how the system works? Why is that 'objectively bad' (as you also claimed)?

&gt; With some notable select exceptions, women have been mostly powerless for roughly 5,000 years 

What precisely do you mean by power? 

With the exception of Kings/queens/other aristocrats, nobody had any serious power in any meaningful sense - 99% of people would consider themselves lucky to have bread to eat, clothes, shelter and not have their heads lopped off by a sword (either that of a thief or an enemy army) for the last 5000 years up until the industrial revolution (and that's only when it STARTED to change). 

That's not to say women didn't have a tough time. They absolutely did. I'm just saying EVERYONE had a tough time.

&gt; Western civs have moved into a quasi egalitarian form of societal structure, where women can obtain and wield actual power without male-driven backing for that power. 

When did this happen? Again, what do you mean by 'power'? 

Do you just mean women are better off (largely because, since the industrial revolution, virtually EVERYONE has been better off)? Or are you referring to women simply not being held back from participating in society by their biology because of some VERY recent technological advances? Do you mean something else?

&gt; Human rights are important to modern humans because we have decided we have the power to not return to an era where we had no rights. Why do you need a specific human right for this convo? 

This is completely circular - essentially 'because 'we' decided (though...North Korea, China, Russia, most of the middle east and south America would disagree...). Firstly, most western countries talk the talk and don't walk the walk with respect to rights. Remember Guantanamo Bay? It's been open under both Democrat and Republican governments. Human right against torture / rendition? Nope. Countries assassinate people they don't like all the time. Right to life? Nope. Countries imprison people they don't like without due process all the time. Right to liberty? Nope. Countries forcibly take away people's property all the time through war / espionage / IP theft etc. Right to property? Nope.

Do we stand up to genocides? Nope. Look at Xinjiang. Heck, we even play buddies with middle eastern despots all the time (until they stop being useful to us). Look at Saddam / Gaddafi.

The reason I was asking for which specific rights you were referring to was:

1. Best case scenario, we cherry pick when we 'allow' people to have 'human rights'; and
2. therefore, it's not at all clear what 'human rights' we even support, or whether we support them at all; and
3. you said that human rights are important for the 'flourishing' of human society. So I wanted to know which rights are important in this regard and how they make human society flourish. I wasn't asking why some people like human rights in a sentimental sense.

&gt; Society is any group of humans that form a meta-group of social norms. I don't know why you think pre-agricultural revolution that people didn't form societies, such a bizarre claim. 

I defined society in a particular way. Again - the institutions that allow large groups of people to cooperate to have an agricultural economy. It's unnecessary to have those institutions before that, hence, in that sense, there was no society.  You define it differently. That's ok, but this is why we're talking at cross purposes here.

In any case, I wanted to understand what you meant by a 'communist' society. You still haven't answered that.

&gt; We have evidence of tribes of 1000s+ and modern tribes can reach up to 2-4 thousand people. They're not just 15 people living in a hut in the forest. 

Are these tribes hunter gatherer or agricultural? Do they get support (food) from the outside world? Which one(s) are you referring to? Again - I want to understand your claim that pre-agricultural tribes had some kind of 'egalitarian' 'communist' system going on.

&gt; We have to go by tribes today + anthropological evidence that seems to back up the idea that modern tribes are mostly unchanged for 10000+ years. All the evidence points to modern tribes being pretty much the same as if we had a time machine and could plop back thousands of years. For good or for bad, tribes don't change much without an outside influence. 

What exact evidence are you referring to? The sum of 99% of human history is that most of these tribes 10000 years ago either:

1. Died out altogether; or
2. evolved into the civilizations that we know today.

That's why 99% of human populations today are in a non-tribal society.",1614556909

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","idk racial and ethnic slurs are obviously offensive, so if you say it it obviously makes you look kinda bad, and ppl will understandably think that youre an ethnicist or racist, depending on the word you used

this whole slur question is a bit weird to me because ive never seen a discussion abt an ancestral slur other than the n word 

i mean i kinda get it why, since this is the only one that is still widely used today (at least to my knowledge. ive never heard of a racial/ethnic slur thats used anywhere near as much as the n word)

its also interesting that this is the only racial/ethnic slur that has been claimed by the ppl it was used against. i mean, why didnt anyone else do the same thing to their ""own"" slur?",1614556909

This has worked especially well in the US, where you have leftists applauding tech giants having unlimited power because in the tech giants spare time they censor conservatives.

"outriders","t5_k8mix","It all depends on how you want to play Pyro, really. I find that Pyro can be a backline fighter almost as well as Technomancer if you're careful.

Aggro Pyro is going to want to bring the fourth unlocked ability, the one that primes/detonates targets around them. It's on a pretty low cooldown and all the targets you slap with it are marked so you get to murder them for health. Your melee and flame waves will also ignite all the targets and then you can pop the detonate, which will do a very good job of clearing the field and getting you to full health.

Backline Pyro should take the third unlocked ability. Combine that with the first ability and you can detonate the sniper nests faster than almost anyone else. You can also combine that with the prime/detonate ability to ruin everything in a pretty large radius.",1614556910

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Did we read the same article a few days ago?  They said specifically that 40k is in a commander product (leaving open though that its not just that) and LOTR product will be available everywhere commander products are sold.   In that same section he specifies that while they will still do some by SL they want to put these cards in the hands of anyone who wants them.  This makes a lot of sense from a business perspective because if wager &gt;85% of magic players know what LOTR is but there is a larger group of LOTR fans who don't play magic and would possibly be brought in with this product.  

In my opinion there are few arguments against why they shouldn't do this.  Scarcity is a joke look at the RL, the lore is better answered above than I ever could, and the slippery slope argument about all IP's being game is irrational as the demand for those products would need to be there.  

&gt;On that note,¬†Universes Beyond¬†products will generally be sold in all¬†Magic¬†channels‚Äîthese will not be strictly¬†Secret Lair¬†products. The¬†Warhammer 40,000¬†Commander decks, for example, will be available everywhere we currently sell Commander decks, as will¬†The Lord of the Rings¬†product. We may occasionally do associated¬†Secret Lair¬†products related to the main release, like the¬†Secret Lair¬†Godzilla lands when¬†Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths¬†came out.

"Quest2","t5_34hzv9","I saw in an earlier comment saying that you dont have a gaming capable PC, but if you have the ability to get sidequest working with your headset check out Dr Beef's port of classic games like Half life with the Lambda 1VR mod.(https://www.lambda1vr.com/) It takes a bit of work to get it working, but once it's installed there's no problems and there are loads of good and comprehensive tutorials for any technical configuration you might have. Even if you dont have a beefy enough PC for other games half life and company are 25- 30 year old game so they're not very technically advanced by today's standards, also with the mod you dont play it on the PC. You install the game from the PC directly to the headset, so your PC/phone may not even need to be able to run said games just act as a way point for the files. Also if you're trying to conserve money you only need to buy a digital copy of half life game from steam which is typically less than 10 dollars. Strong VR legs required however lambda1vr was one of the best story driven vr experiences I've had since getting the quest2 and I've since downloaded and installed the 2 DLC games for half life to my headset.",1614556911

"melbourne","t5_2qkhb","I went through applying for a  PSIO recently -  the initial temporary issuance doesn't involve the defendant. When you want it extended then the defendant is invited to the hearing/mention. (unless its changed since August last year and Feb this year)  You get the chance to have a say at that point if the headcase keeps contacting you. It won't look good for the headcase when you can read off your diary of events that they keep making contact. At this point I'd suggest logging your own PSIO against the headcase as they are harassing you and making you feel unsafe. You don't need a lawyer - download and fill out the forms yourself and send it to the court:

"RaidShadowLegends","t5_npfgx","Part of the reason to run Ghrush is so that you can build more stats into your champs since you don't have to use lifesteal gear. Ghrush + a team in lifesteal is just overkill on healing. If you are gonna run Ghrush you also really want that A1 booked so that you can make sure to keep the leech up 100% of the fight.

NM CB has 170 speed, so unless you are tuning very specifically (which it doesn't seem like you are doing), you need your champs to be as fast or faster so they can keep up their health on later turns. 

Having a champ that places a team counteratk buff or an ally attack champ can help push your damage as you can more easily break the 1 attack per champ per turn barrier. That helps your lifesteal/leech heals and gives you more chances at warmaster procs, not to mention gives more chances to apply your debuffs from a1s. Alternatively, adding in a champ that applies another defensive buff (ally protect, block debuffs, strengthen, block damage, unkillable, revive on death) can give you more sustain so your team can last longer, again increasing your damage output.",1614556911

Was fighting argent odin. She used the USB early in the fight, cast, and successfully got her chase.

Later in the fight, she used her awakening and then I used the USB. That *should* give w-cast witch (with a 35% chance of an additional cast thanks to her LM2) *and* the USB chaser, which has a pretty high multiplier--enough that it can break cap with a halfway decent chain.

On her next cast of Howling Flames, she triplecast--but with no USB chaser.

The only notable thing that happened in between was Mog AASB2 giving the ""Mog Step"" chaser that cures statuses.

Is it possible Mog Step is somehow clearing off the USB chaser? If so, is that a bug with Mog AASB2 or with Matoya USB?

I get you lost much but that's what you had to lose, so if someone lose $100.00, guess what, that's what they had to lose. Eventually my one little share that could grew and no I'm not over 1000 but I'm over a hundred now and gaining. Every last person here was new at a time and of you did your DD before, good for you, but as your previous comment, there was some DD you obviously didn't do and sadly it cost you, so again ... The distain for inquiry is unnecessary and as you would probably have felt if someone said those things to you, inconsiderate. Someone surely loss more than you, but that didn't make your loss any less for you.

"SpainAuxiliares","t5_gspcj","It isn't simple to become a public school teacher in Spain. It takes a long time and a lot of effort, including passing comprehensive exams in Spanish that all public employees have to pass. That said, the auxiliares program can provide you with great classroom experience. Not necessarily great teaching experience, because the amount you get to actually teach is entirely up to your teaching partner/coordinator. Auxiliares can be used as anything from a true partner-teacher, to a parrot speaking English words as needed on command. It's the luck of the draw. But you get paid well for a short work-week, hopefully without a lot of time spent in transit, and it can be a lot of fun if you approach it with an open mind and a heart for the kiddos. If you're planning on a Masters in education/to be a teacher in the US, and you want to spend some time in Europe, it's a perfect way to take a break from your studies while getting some bilingual classroom skills. (You could probably even do your MEd. online while you're doing the aux program, if you find a degree that works for you.) In sum, it's not a way to become a public school teacher in Spain, but it can potentially be a way to become a concertado (public/private), private school or academy teacher.",1614556913

As a 15+ year Audio Engineer and Mastering Engineer for the last 7, I believe the amount of testing that *I did* was overkill for a retro system, especially a Game Gear.  I don't want to reveal any secrets in this thread, but my point may be seen in the data I provide in the spoiler.  The advent of highly visual audio plug-ins has made a large void in the ""tuning"" of engineer's ears, due to the fact of relying on the visual representation of what is heard rather than utilizing the trained ear.  In a nutshell, I want the data provided to be understood by all, rather than tailor it to engineers.  This is an 8-bit gaming system with inherently poor audio based on a TDA2822/KA2209 IC.  I can see MNILWIK posted in this thread similar information to my large rant a month back about the limitations of the TDA2822/KA2209.

Besides, Biden is a Republican.

His father had remarried soon after his biological mother‚Äôs death, and the experiencer had nevereven seen a photo of her. A few weeks after this episode, his aunt, having heardabout this vision, visited and brought a picture of his mother posing with anumber of other people. The man had no difÔ¨Åculty picking his mother out of thegroup, to the astonishment of his father (Rawlings 1978:17‚Äì22).

"Fighters","t5_2s5rz","same man, raging blast underrated. 

and i can't remember if you needed to beat story to unlock anyone, i would doubt it. so you should be good to go.

i just looked it up,  they have another fighting game coming out based on the Demon slayer Series.

looks to have slightly, and i do mean slightly more depth/ defensive options than storm currently offers.  but it plays pretty much identical as one would expect on the offensive side of things. 

so if you wanna use storm as a stepping stone for that, i wouldn't blame you lol. as that will become the most ""healthy"" PC arena fighter.

but remember,  really go through the  the roster,  it's more important to find assist that work for your playstyle than it is for you to find a main.

for example.   Neji is one of best defensive assit in the game. because his barrier can either push back a charging opponent, or  if used offensive, and blocked,  leaves your opponent block stunned for a fairly long time so you can bust through his guard much easier.  i haven't played in years, so i can't remember every last property of every last assist.  but i do remember that one.",1614556914

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","I did it with Chrono Trigger in mind. After introductions they get to attend a festival with different 'games' centred around various checks and saving throws to get their feet wet with rolling dice and trying things out. 
Arm wrestling for Strength Checks,
Pig herding for animal handling
Drinking contest for Constitution Saves,
And so on.

 The festival includes a massive pillow fight in a barn with children, watched over by an old lady knitting. The party can engage in it as a sort of 'no rules', pvp and no concequences introduction to how combat works. The funniest part being that the moment a pillow accidently hits the old lady she stands up and shows off that she's actually a Barbarian and the 'boss' of the encounter. 

I leave a few plot hooks around as well for then to follow after they've had their fill of the festivities and want to play for real.",1614556915

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I can answer this as someone who has spent more than a decade writing game reviews for metacritic listed sites, but I can only answer this from my own perspective. I hold no formal training in criticism. I have qualifications in professional writing, sub-editing and screen and media, but I haven't ever seen any opportunity to become qualified in criticism. I have reviewed for sites like IGN and GameSpot, but being based in Australia most of my stuff has been on Australian sites. The site I ran a decade ago, GameArena, was the first Australian site to be listed on Metacritic. I have written more than 100 reviews. I do them less these days because they are flat out not worth the money. I still do them because, at heart, my favourite thing to write in all the world is game reviews.

&gt; You might argue that reviews are subjective and there can't be an objective criticism of a video game but that would make the usefulness of a review subjective as well.

This statement is specifically true. A review's usefulness is entirely subjective. The problem with many modern reviews is that they attempt to cater to as many people as possible. To be as useful to as many people as possible. This is why you see diluted opinions featuring less critical examination. Part of this is because games media is a business and getting people on side is good for business. Another part of this is because if you deliver well-reasoned games opinion concentrate and it doesn't flow with the 'consensus opinion' in the moment, people will demand that [IGN is removed from metacritic](https://stevivor.com/news/new-petition-aims-remove-igns-doom-review-cause-affects-metacritic/) and they will send you death threats and hate mail for literally years. Your reward for doing this, by the way, will equal out to about $6 (USD) an hour. 

&gt;However, it is important to make a review as objective as possible and minimize subjectivity.

I disagree. In fact, this statement directly leads to the same dilution I mentioned above. It is the trick some reviewers use to avoid the pitfalls of subjectivity, because objectivity is broad and inarguable (well, you know) whereas subjectivity can be contentious.

&gt;Should I expect legitimate criticism from IGN/Kotaku when they post the trailer for a game's sequel with the headline 'Check out this awesome trailer for the Sequel?' Are they advertisers? Journalists? Critics or Bloggers?

Think about why a person gets into games media. Having dabbled elsewhere, I can tell you that all media pays like shit, but games media in particular pays garbage. So why would a person get into an industry that pays like arse? Passion. And that passion is exploited in a variety of ways, but the manner related to your question here is actually pretty simple - they write the news pieces their ~~publisher~~ *(I said publisher because the boss of an editor is often a publisher but I realise this might be misleading because publishers in gaming generally refer to games companies)* editor tells them to write, in ways that get clicks, on the promise that they might get to exercise their passion by playing games early or more or, in my case, with the opportunity to also critically analyse them.

&gt;My favourite example to bring up when I am making this point is Dragon Age Inquisition.

Another way passion gets exploited is via hype. Let's say you're an editor. You have two writers. One of them is ambivalent towards Dragon Age. The other one writes Fenris/Morrigan fanfic in their spare time. You need a review, and the deadline (the embargo) is four days from now. Which one gets the gig? Before you choose, know that these are real people. You maintain a relationship with these people. If you choose poorly, you will have to deal with the consequences, and you just know the person writing Fenris/Morrigan fanfic has a flair for the dramatic. But more than that, per the previous paragraph, people go through the hard slog on the promise of getting a taste of something like this. One of these writers might feel like the implied agreement has been betrayed if you pick the other.

So you pick writer number two. They are hyped beyond all hype for this game, and they get to play it early. I didn't wind up playing the final release of DA:I so I'm not able to really go into what they might have found, but I assume they're thrilled by all the dragons and inquisitions. They had expectations, and those expectations were met. They put out their review and it gets a 9.5/10. They loved it, though they note that it felt a little empty sometimes. Writer 1 plays it, and they aren't as thrilled. The AI is garbage, which makes the combat tedious, which makes the gameplay dull, which makes it only worthwhile for the storytelling. It'd be better as a visual novel, but as an RPG it's a flop. Still, you have to stand by your reviewer. And really, wouldn't a person obsessed with the narrative of Dragon Age adore a game that excels in that particular area? What if they never really cared about the combat stuff to begin with?

It is a conundrum. Writer 2 wrote subjectively, wrote to their passion, and in the end their review was only subjectively useful to people who enjoy Dragon Age games for the story *at the expense* of everything else. But if this hypothetical situation was itself a visual novel with ~~Choose Your Own Adventure~~ branching narrative elements, I would wager that choosing Writer 2 would be the only one that doesn't result in a failure state. But with the benefit of hindsight, we know that it would be, on a grander scale, the wrong move.

They are victims of hype. We all are, at one point or another.

The modern system has flaws. Reviews capture a moment in time, which was fine when games used to be finished upon release. But these days they aren't. I'm not even talking about the Cyberpunks. I reviewed Dead by Daylight in 2016 and gave it a 6/10, saying it was filled with potential but flaws at the time held it back. I reviewed it again in 2020, when they'd fixed those issues, and celebrated how far it had come and how well it had grown. It got a 9/10. That was six months ago. If I reviewed it last week, I might have given it a 6/10 a game because they've made some critical errors lately.

The system also doesn't highlight the writer enough. It's not ""Joabyjojo's review"", it's ""IGN's review"". ""IGN said that Call of Duty Ghosts was better than Doom 2016!"" was something I saw going around back in late 2016, which handily ignored the fact that I didn't write IGN's Ghosts review, *and* that my review of Ghosts was very negative (although I think the website it was on had gone down by 2016). If there was more emphasis on the writer, readers could make the connection easier and understand the subjectivity inherent to the review, but it just doesn't happen.

&gt;He has a point about being the importance of a critic understanding gaming history for their reviews to have any use. 

This is why games critics have value, in my opinion, and I absolutely agree with him. The reason I have the confidence to say what I do about games is because I have played them for more than 3 decades. I've played more games than almost anyone I know. The only people who have played more are other game critics I know who are older than me. I take it very seriously. I read every review I see, I play every game inside my wheelhouse and a handful of those without, I do my best to work out not just what I liked or didn't like about something, but why I did or didn't like it. The way Takeru Kobayashi taught himself to be the best at eating hot dogs, or MJ worked to play the best basketball, I have worked at being the best game critic I can be. And I know for a fact that I am not alone in doing this.

The difference between me and MJ or Kobayashi is that when I do the thing I think I'm the best at the world at, I get paid less than minimum wage and I receive years of hate mail. Well, me and Kobayashi have some of that in common I guess.

Anyway all of this is to say, what's important is you find a reviewer whose subjectivity aligns with yours. There are amazing reviewers out there, doing hard work, going to great lengths for not a lot of reward, to share their critical analysis of games. It's getting harder to find them, but they are out there. My advice for finding one that's right for you - go find your favourite game from last year  and read the highest three and lowest three reviews on metacritic. Then do the same for a game you thought didn't work so well.",1614556917

You would probably want an anti androgen and pills, patches or gel to start with but could also check out e monotherapy, without blood tests though (which you can do privately with a place like medichecks) it would be difficult to know if your testosterone is properly suppressed.

I started by getting hormones from United pharmacy because they have some really cheap spiro and the estrogens aren't too expensive either and they've also been reliable and easy to use, the only problem being that with covid affecting delivery it can take about a month for an order to arrive. Of the other places I've used: Aphrodites was sometimes a bit of a pain with taking their time and often have stock issues. Shapeshifter I used a couple of times and they seem quite reliable and have a decent price for cypro which you don't have to use more than a quarter or eighth of a pill to lower T. In house pharmacy is a bit expensive.


Now I'm taking 6mg of cypro and 50mg of spiro a day just to be sure my T is gone and every 4 days an EV injection from a lady called lena. It cost me about ¬£200-¬£300 pounds to get a stock of AA's and two vials from lena but I haven't had to buy any more hormones for almost a year now. I would have preferred to stay on pills than injections though as my levels were too high when I had the NHS bloodtest.",1614556917

Be careful about land. It is all zoned for specific purposes and while it can be changed, for example, from farmland to residence, it's not going to be easy and often impossible. Especially in Prague where land is scarce. In the country, many times, there is a reason land is zoned a specific way e.g. land is for recreation purpose only because it is within a protected nature reserve so the municipality will not allow sewage and therefore will never approve re-zoning. You could build a cottage there but it will never have a mailing address and will never have modern-day conveniences.

Also theres a difference in baby and fetus. But it's better to say babies are being killed than fetus right? To get more outrage that is. It's womens body you don't have the right to restrict their choices in bodily autonomy. Also abortions wasn't considered bad till around 1950s. If you consider contraception to be life then we can argue sperm to also be considered life and therefore masturbation a sin. Vasectomies on men should be required if they are no longer reproducing, to not kill life. 


Religion just wants to control humans in every aspect of their life. Religion is a tool not needed anymore. It was tool back then to control the masses and to rule over them and it's true till today. You should read on the atrocities of religion in history. 


Banning abortion causes more damage to a system not already equipped to handle the amount of orphans, destroys families not built to handle another baby, rape victims not able get rid of their past, women not knowing till pregnancy they will die if they give birth and much more never thought about because you're taught ""they're killing babies"" and ""you should be mad"".

I've found sometimes pointing out to people, you wouldn't accept this from friends, why should you from family who are supposed to love and respect you even more, makes them stop and think. It might also help him to unpack other behaviour, such as the medical issues that seem to only get worse when she wants him.

It's gone way to far, and he might end up in a situation where he outright resents her and that's not really viable if he wants any relationship with her. Separating them really has to happen, you said in the hotel he was happy, free, y'all had some fun and joy... Point out to him, that could be his every single morning if he just says no to her and accepts he is not responsible for her. She's a full grown adult who is capable of working, she can be an adult in full. Not your husband's unwanted child

She is the parent. He is the child. That's the dynamic here and it needs to be put back there.

2. People would complain about getting their asses kicked by higher skilled teams. If that wasn't already the case  with Gambit and Trials/Crucible. SBMM has never worked properly in reality.




3. Lag and loading.

A few % of the population has ever completed a raid. Now you want two teams to find each other consistently every time one wants to raid? And with SBMM? You'll be waiting for a long while and this will piss people off.

Now farmers and speedrunners do the raid very often but the rng aspect of the other team's skill will put them off.

Having 12 people is quite laggy. Ive done 12 man DSC and the 3rd encounter was straight up broken (orbs not spawning/ 3 orbs despit OP shooting/ All 4 cans glowing etc)

Would you stay friends with an abusive stranger you randomly met? No. Would you feel responsible for strangers mental/physical state? No. You did the right thing to distance yourself.

As for missing out on something. Don't let yourself be fooled by the societal narrative of a perfect family. Many if not most families are less than great. You want the jackpot. But, only a few get that. Most win a (very) small prize. 

Become that perfect caring person for yourself. Love yourself. Treat yourself with respect. 

Put some energy into developing yourself. 

Past is past. You can only go forward.

Good luck!

"EnoughCommieSpam","t5_3fblz"," I didn't post this thread to debate that, mate. I've already researched and read countless debates like this and made my mind, hence why this sub's got the name it has and why I comment here. You probably did the same and I respect that. That said, I'm not expressly against all forms of socialism/communism and I do believe they can work in a limited scale in very specific circumstances. What I'm expressly against, is the lack of awareness of academical and theoretical knowledge on economics, geopolitics and philosophy that seems to thrive in these circles.

The arguments are already out there.  People on both sides who are far more informed and eloquent than you and me have presented their arguments and its all available to the public. Look out for them. I seriously doubt that, even if our hypothetical debate was carried out here right now, we would convince each other of anything. This is not even a debate thread nor a debate purposed sub. 

I posted this thread to raise awareness among anti-communists to raise the standards of their arguments, which are quite often too reductionist and based on attacking history, rather than on anti-communist and free-market sound theoretical knowledge that's also proven.

 If we want to build better societies, we need to understand as many ideas as we can, otherwise we will not be able to communicate in a civil manner and will be damned to be used as pawns of the groups in power...whis is sadly happening too often around the world.",1614556922

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","First off, thank you for taking her in. Even more, thank you for fighting for her. That in and of itself means the world to her, and has had an incredible positive impact on her life, even if she never lets you know that. 

As for your question, I recommend you start with some specific goals/definitions for ‚Äúcomfortable in her adult life.‚Äù Do you want her to be able to go to college/trade school without taking on debt? Do you want to jump start retirement? Do you want to simply continue supporting her financially?

Next, you‚Äôll want to define the level of control you want and the level of freedom of access to the money you want her to have. As you well know by now, the abuse she has endured has caused some very real damage to her neurological functioning. You‚Äôre seeing this come out in high-stress or triggering situations resulting in some poor and impulsive decision making. Do you want her to have full access to the money at 18, or do you want to maintain some control in case things take a turn for the worse?

If your goals are primarily for education (college or trade) you may consider a 529 plan. You‚Äôll get some tax advantages, and as the owner, you‚Äôll control the money. 

If you‚Äôre thinking more long term, a trust fund would be a good option. You‚Äôll want to consult legal counsel here, and perhaps some financial advice depending on how you want to set up the fund. This will allow you to define stipulations, put someone else (or yourself) in charge of the money, and allow a full payout at some future point (again, could define stipulations). There‚Äôs a lot to consider there, so talk through it with an attorney. You may even ask around for one with experience in trust funds for individuals with mental disorders (I‚Äôm assuming you could find that, I‚Äôve never looked myself).",1614556922

Then I have to slather my entire hands and penis in cheto dust. Then I can go for 15 more. Now we at 50. Only 7 to go. From thier it is pure determination.

Often even before I've said why people tend to get offended that I didn't just agree with them completely and say they're perfect and it's everyone else's fault.

But I refuse to just sit and agree with them because imo that would make me a terrible friend if I didn't help at all and just added to the problem.

The aggression is because it sounded like you were asking a leading question for validation and a lot of narcissistic people make posts where they try to frame themselves as a victim and either men or women as awful somehow and ask questions everyone knows the answer to to get upvotes since everyone will agree. Its annoying to see posts like that and degrades the quality of the sub.  

You posted a question basically any adult would know the answer to, and then detailed a scenario where someone didn't really do anything wrong but because its listed next to the question in the title it implies he thinks that and anyone who doesn't read closely (which is most people) will likely think he thinks that.

I didn't realize you had autism and may not understand relational things that most people do.

Changes:

*We have [new ranges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18THB-Z9H_OgKA1ZpjlJhyCOKAomwMsK2x70NrGAHEpw/edit#gid=1158550043) this season, primarily including the additions of three new playbooks, pistol on offense, and 4-4 and 3-3-5 on defense (option on offense has been renamed to flexbone). If you would like to change to these and have not yet had the opportunity to do so, you can fill out the [playbook change request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewLoCZDLv3q4yee7YFqZO1CYYrNlhpk9nwC5yR21Skb4NUOA/viewform?usp=sf_link), though any requests set in after your game starts won't be able to go through until next week. However, a change through this won't count against the current rule of one playbook change per season as of now, in case you decide you want to switch back.

Welcome new coaches just joining us over the last couple days! If you are new and have ANY questions related to how gameplay works, or are a veteran and would like to change your playbook to air raid, please ask either on Discord or by PMing /u/officialstc. We will be glad to help you! It is also worth noting that the roll call bot once again messed up nearly all FCS matchups this week, as it has been doing, so you are likely playing a different team than it said you are there, but just in case, check the [FCS schedule sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ly18b0fsLqJ2MTQ9PsHOSRvu-Lwu4AVHVI7hfbsMirs/edit#gid=570808560) to make sure.

To answer some common questions for you, you can check out this [FAQ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeCollegeFootball/comments/doyiij/fake_cfb_faqnew_coach_guide/).

If you ever see any typos or errors with the bot, please ping Watchful1 by posting a comment in response to the bots comment and he'll come take a look. If your game breaks completely, the fastest way to get help if on discord in the #refbot channel. 

If you have any ideas of how the bot could be improved, please post them in the #refbot channel or submit an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Watchful1/CFBRef/issues).

**Intro:** Started getting back to work, now everything is back online in Texas. 

**Stats -** Age: 19 \[M\], Height: 5'8"", Weight: 156 lbs, BF: est. 16%, Status: Single, Ethnicity: Asian

**PHYSICAL**: **9/10**

* Started doing 531 Boring But Big to start my cut
* Goal is to get down to 10% body fat. Will be cutting 10 lbs at a time and evaluating from there. So next goal weight is 142-144lbs. Basically if I can see abs regardless of lighting.
* Peak bulking stats. Squat: 225lbs 5x3, Deadlift 225lbs 5x3, Bench Press 165 5x3, Shoulder press 100lbs 5x3
* Doing really well in terms of fitness overall
* Wore a button down shirt with one button left unbuttoned and rolled sleeves. Was like wow I look good. 
* Looking to get some outerwear next.
* I have gained 1lb this week average. Likely to fluctuations. Still losing body fat as far as I can tell.
* Started doing running again. I have a PFT (USMC Physical Fitness Test) coming up. Goal is a 21 - 22 min 3 mile. Did one today to check time. Came in around 25 mins this week. Have a lot of work to do. 
* Unfortunately fell prey to my insane burst of lust and desire. I binged 4 hours of porn in one day. Feel terrible now about it, but in the moment it just felt so good. Just got in a mood swing of combination of stress and boredom. Idle hands I guess they say. 

**MENTAL/EMOTIONAL**: **6/10**

* Started New School Semester and have been on top of everything. Doing homework early, getting stuff done instead of procrastinating.
* Reading more books to improve my mental capacity. Currently in the process of reading through MCDP - 1 warfighting. This book is about the principles of warfighting, but as always there is knowledge that can be parallel to civilian life.
* Reading no more nice in parallel with a friend to mentor him a little.
* So after some introspection, I have decided to go onto focusing on re-centering my life to be more mission and Christ oriented. Woman became too much of an obsession and idol.
* I would just spend my days pondering how I could improve my approach and day game. How I could cater my self to get women to like me. I have now reconsidered this to be the wrong approach. In terms of pursuing women that will have to sit on the back burner.
* Took a good look at myself and now I am on the Dunning-Krueger effect of realizing how little I actually know. Taking some time to learn and repurpose things in my life.
* After deciding not to pursue woman, when I converse with them I try to throw in teases and such to see how it plays out. Since I don't really care about it, its a risk free way to see what works and doesn't
* Started practicing singing again semi-regularly. Going to probably make this a new hobby.
* Going to work on consistency this upcoming week. Am I consistently doing the things I say I will. Am I congruent with myself.

**SPIRITUAL**: **6/10**

* Assurance of Salvation: Still confident on this
* Quite Time: did quiet time 4 times this week hoping to make it a daily thing next week.
* Bible Study: Started studying the gospels. Specifically John.
* Scripture Memory: Like 2 or 3 now.
* Prayer: Pray daily and give thanks to God. God is looking out for me.
* Evangelism: Perhaps my friend who is a passive Christian (Christian by association) will be worked on.
* Fellowship: I have joined the Choir so that is a plus and will get me more connected. Starting to meet more people in the choir.
* Mission: needs to become solidified. Still haven't really found it. Its starting to form in my mind, but still definitely not revealed or clear to me. Potential outlook is to use influence to spread to the chinese american community, being that they are the biggest asian community that are largely atheist.
* I have managed to start discipling a friend who came to me looking for advice. Haven't gotten much into the spiritual aspect of it yet, but I have got him to go to the gym and start reading No More Mr. Nice guy. In time I will gain his confidence and begin bringing spiritual issues up with him.
* Every week is a grind to move forward. I am reminded of my time in boot camp where a retired seal told us to remember 2 Timothy 2:3. ( I always like to replace soldier with marine

**Outro:** Disappointed by my spout of porn use. However I am making great progress in other areas of my life. My mission statement hopefully is starting to shape up. I have an Idea. I want to be a model for others in the chinese american community. There is a lot of effeminate men in the asian community. Maybe I can start bringing them over to become how God wants men to be in the church and in life. As well as bringing the atheist in the community over to christ.",1614556927

I have a harder time listening to the newer albums that came after Disintegration and Wish but to each their own. I think it depends on when you discover them and what songs you first get into.  There‚Äôs a couple albums IMO that are harder to get all the way through, the Top in particular but again that‚Äôs just a personal opinion but if you‚Äôre just starting out perhaps leave that one for later. I‚Äôd say just pick an album and listen to it a few times through.  You won‚Äôt go wrong.

Edit. There‚Äôs also a couple of really good live albums I break out from time to time. Paris, and Show. Both great albums with lots of the hits on them. The Cure are great live; always great production and really tight.",1614556927

Their symbols aren't overtly Satanic however, they are more abstract in nature. This kind of reminds me of this girl I was talking to who was convinced that Walmart was nefarious because if you turn it backwards it is Mart Law, aka Martial Law. She refused to listen when I pointed out that Walmart started as a small business by Sam Walton hence the name, and that it still doesn't even make sense because if you turn around the name it's not Mart Law, It's Tram Law. The problem with finding symbolism everywhere you look is that it is *incredibly* easy to find if you're really trying to find it. And people don't even care if it makes sense, like the Walmart example there. You could take virtually anything and interpret it as a nefarious symbol if you really wanted to. ""Wait a minute... the grocery store Smart n Final... Hitler was technically smart... and he had a final solution! OMG Nazis confirmed!!!"" It's not helping anyone and it only serves to discredit valid conspiracy theory. Is the WEF evil to its core, and does it have nefarious schemes and plots? 100%. Is that a blatant 666 in its logo?

"hypnosis","t5_2qjlg","Indeed an intriguing subject! And good question. No, you never ever want to re-trigger someone into hypnosis. It's not a positive or beneficial way to go in. The positive way to overload someone is usually with little things. Like words you use, paradoxes, odd noises, etc. This happens to us naturally sometimes, such as when we've had a long day at work and we're on our drive home. There's a lot of data the subconscious has taken in that day, and continues to as we drive with all the signs and lanes and pedals and other drivers, etc. We may naturally escape and end up pulling into our driveway and realizing (consciously) that we dont recall the drive, but made it home safely. That daydreaming is hypnosis! 

Another example is when someone is telling a long story and after a while our eyes start to glaze over. We're being overloaded. This kind of storytelling can be used therapeutically. It's called ""conversational hypnosis."" Milton Erickson was famous for it.",1614556928

LOA helps rendezvous you with a perfect and delicious PATHWAY. There is nothing more satisfying to the soul than co-creating with Souce on this planet, it's why you came! Think from an Eternal's Soul perspective, what's more fulfilling and wonderful: engaging in a life-long soul-level fulfilling passion, where you get to do things you love every day, helping out millions of other human beings achieve their goals too.

Plopping millions of dollars in your lap. You know what happens to most lottery winners, right? (addictions ruin their lives and most become penniless in a few years) Not *you* of course. :) 

If you want a good example of a guy who just meditated and followed his guidance and what interested him, and became a multi-billionaire, Read Michael Singer's excellent book, [The Surrender Experiment.](https://untetheredsoul.com/surrender-experiment)

To put it on other terms, and without getting into too much spoiler territory, nothing that happens on Batwoman up to that point, or on any other DC show intersects with Black Lightning. The only thing that can be ""out of order"" are a series of events that happen simultaneously with different characters within the last episode of each show, but Batwoman and BL don't really intersect at all before the crossover itself.",1614556928

Cars may be parked at the edges, there will be hedges and bushes, ... It's not even just the width, also the length - in a parking lot or those streets with parking at ~45 or 90¬∞ to the street your car may poke out of the crowd, trying to find a parking spot along the edge of a road you'll be squeezing into shorter gaps, and you'll find it harder to turn around on narrow roads. 

Also taxes on petrol. People do have big SUVs, just like people have vans, but they're not the most practical day-to-day cars for most people. If you actually need a big car, vans and minivans/ ""soccer mom cars"" have more lockable carrying capacity. Unless you need it to go through standing water or off-road, or are a landscaper, the main perk of US-style trucks seems to be the looks and fun?

If your goal is to unite the country then the fastest way to ensure it doesn‚Äôt happen is to institute a popular vote only form of presidential elections. The funny thing about your point ‚Äúwe are the UNITED states of America‚Äù is you didn‚Äôt capitalize the second part of that sentence: STATES. We are a country made of individual sovereign states United under a central government whose job is to provide for the common defense of the nation, regulate interstate commerce and provide a meeting place for states to negotiate and hear each other out on issues of the day. By having the electoral college in place, you are GUARANTEEING that each state (and the people within that state) have a voice in who becomes president. If your concern is that people votes don‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs not a strictly popular vote then you‚Äôre missing the entire point. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúnational election‚Äù delineated in the constitution, there are state elections for president carried out on the same day every four years. Which means the election is really about each individual state carrying out an election with its own people over which candidate gets their electoral college votes. The people DO have a voice, because they vote on which way their own individual state goes. In the interest of maintaining that EVERY SINGLE STATE gets an EQUAL voice in the matter, the electoral college must remain. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this system whatsoever. It has reliably provided us with a standard and well understood way of selecting a president for well over 250 years. If you are a liberal or a leftist concerned with equality, then you should like the electoral college. It provides every single person in this country with a voice that actually matters.",1614556929

However, the numbers of the infected in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Chiba prefectures have not come down.  In order to end the declaration by March 7th, the government is asking \[people in those areas\] to work from home and not go out as much as possible.",1614556929

Anyways, at this point, your goldfish is terribly stunted, but there's still hope to give him a good life and improve his condition. Your tank size is extremely bellow the bare minimum tank size for 1 goldfish. If the goldfish is a fancy variety, they need 20-30 gallons for 1 goldfish. If they're a common goldfish (aka ""feeder goldfish""), they need at least 50 gallons for 1. It's also crucial you have a proper water test kit if you have any aquatic pet because even if water looks clean, there could be nitrites or ammonia present which will make fish very stressed and ill even in small amounts as it burns their gills and attacks their immune system :( Until you're able to buy a larger tank, I highly recommend moving the goldfish to one of these: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sterilite-200-Qt-Stacker-Box-Taupe-Splash/475349461

Here is a good test kit I use that tends to be recommended a lot: https://www.chewy.com/api-freshwater-aquarium-master-test/dp/121955

Until you're able to get the goldfish to at least 50 gallons, you'll want to do 50% water changes every day to keep ammonia levels as low as possible.",1614556931

My bweathing intensifies as I wowk towawd this indescwibabwe need.  Miss Mae gwabs howd of my hips and squeezes me tightwy, my cock and bawws fwop against hew with each deepened and stwengthened thwust.

Each exhawe seems to escape with the cwashing down of my hips into Miss Mae and is punctuated by a squeak of a moan, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too much.  I can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep going.  Fuck, you wook so beautifuw.‚Äù

My back tightens as my head tiwts backwawd.  Extending my awms is, itsewf, an undewtaking but I successfuwwy weach out as my hands gwasp Miss Mae‚Äôs wegs.  The new angwe that she penetwates me ampwifies the indescwibabwe sensation.  I feew hew watching me, feew hew fascination.  It‚Äôs awmost as if I am the buww and she the cowboy.  The animaw inside me neawwy uncontwowwabwe, wewe it not fow hew.

Hew wight hand weaves my hip and once again finds my cock.  It‚Äôs wet with my awousaw and I haggawdwy mumbwe a whimpewed pwea, ‚Äúahh, pwease.  It‚Äôs too much.‚Äù

He quickwy wesponds to hew touch, my ass muscwes tensing invowuntawiwy, quickening the whowe pwocess.

‚ÄúOh baby, such a good boy fow me.‚Äù

I stawt to question if she is tawking to me ow my cock.  I‚Äôm unabwe to catch my bweathe, feew as though I‚Äôm chasing the pwesent, just seconds behind aww of it.  *Oh my god! Howy fucking heww!*

I tiwt my head back down and see hew focus, hew detewmination.  She is expectant and she wooks up fwom my cock to penetwate my eyes.  They twavew wight to my cowe and I buckwe, sounds I‚Äôve nevew heawd befowe, nevew made befowe spew fwom my wips.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it.  C‚Äômon baby.‚Äù  Hew stwokes quicken awound my thwobbing cock.  *I can‚Äôt, no, oh god.  Oh fuck.*

Suddenwy hew diwdo is hitting a spot in me that sends a fwight signaw to my bwain.  *Too much, too much!*

But I am wooted on hew, I want to be hew good boy, I beg and pwead with mysewf.  The desiwe consumes me and as she hits that spot each time I faww into hew wap, hew hand tightens just enough awound my cock.  My bawws tighten once again and I am spewing my second owgasm into hew hand and onto hew stomach.

I hump and gwind on hew wap, dumb and chaotic with euphowia.  She is pwaising me and I am gwowing, my entiwe body feewing as though I am asweep and yet nevew mowe woke.

Time ceases to exist, I wide this wave of ecstasy and it extends, ebbing and fwowing with the beating of ouw bodies.  I swow, uttewwy exhausted and weak.

I cowwapse onto hew, hew diwdo fwopping fwom my ass.

‚ÄúOh my god, howy... howy shit.  That was.‚Äù  I am bweathwess, ‚Äúthat was.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmazing.  God that was so fucking hot.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sowwy.‚Äù

‚ÄúFow what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just... that was.‚Äù  I swawwow and twy to find wowds fow what just happened.

‚ÄúYou wewe amazing baby, fucking amazing.  Such a sexy thing. Woww ovew.‚Äù  She pushes me off hew and onto my back.

She cwimbs up onto my chest, the diwdo jutting out ovew my face.  I‚Äôm stiww wowking to wecovew, ‚ÄúYou need to taste.  Thewe‚Äôs nothing to be sowwy about my good boy.‚Äù

In my haze I stwuggwe to undewstand exactwy what she means.  I watch hew wub hew hand ovew hew stomach and then wun it between hew wegs.  She then gwips the diwdo, wifts it as she wowews hew pewfection- wawm, wet, and gwistening onto my face.

Whatevew gwip I had wemaining ow had possibwy wegained oozed out the tip of my cock as my tongue swid inside hew and tasted hew dewicacy.

Hew thighs cwenching awound my head as she gwinds into me.  *Thank you Miss Mae.*

"nba","t5_2qo4s","The idea that a ‚Äúplaymaker‚Äù would solve the issue is silly. Which ‚Äúplaymaker‚Äù available would kawhi or PG defer to? 

The issue is when games get close PG and Kawhi go into ISO mode and don‚Äôt look to run sets. When they play loose and the ball pings around the offense is great. But in close games they get into tunnel vision too much. It‚Äôs up to Lue to hold them accountable for it. They gotta hunt mismatches. They are basically taking Giannis and Middleton 1 on 1 in the final possessions this game.

In clutch moments how often is it not the super star with the ball in their hands? The idea that Ricky Rubio gets inserted he‚Äôd be directing the offense in the last two minutes is pretty laughable.",1614556932

"RationalPsychonaut","t5_2yce6","Science discounts individual subjective experience. It looks at humans as numbers, and the individual as the sum of the mechanical processes going on within them. Never does it ask the human 'who are you?' it always just tells them. And if one isn't careful, one comes to believe that one is just a mechanical process, without any agency of one's own. 

The Scientific method is still a valid way for a person to ask questions of themselves. It is only when a person uses other people's assumptions for who they are to define themselves that they lose the ability to discover it for themselves. 

So a person who wants to know themselves must 'experiment with truth'.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","Just finished that short story/novella collection Different Seasons by Stephen King, damn, I know there's been movies made of his more non-horror/fantastical writings but I feel like his fiction/non-horror stuff is still kinda underrated, thought every short story was really good.

I'm a sucker for nostalgic coming of age stuff but The Body (movie Stand By Me is based on) is such a great story and really well-written, lots of great imagery/descriptions/characters in there.

Shawshank Redemption was also incredible, another awesome story, loved the descriptions of Andy Dufresne and harsh realities of prison life, I really need to see that movie.

Even Breathing Method, maybe the weakest story, is still a fucking great story. 

Also Apt Pupil is probably the most psychologically horrifying thing I've ever read, like goddamn, scarily vivid and intense and really damn relevant today considering the prevalence of alt-right youth radicalization via the internet and what not. 10/10 would recommend Different Seasons even if you don't like horror/Stephen King.

be careful as estate agents love to shove areas into other "" better "" areas to get a sale ive seen some flats on the wicker advertised as Kelham when they are not.

"cantax","t5_357tq","&gt;So, 3000 dollar gain won't be taxed as a capital gain?

Correct



&gt;For the contribution limit, you mean if I transfer from my savings account to TFSA more than contribution limit (6000), I will be taxed over it? Say 10k transferred from my savings account to TFSA, I will be taxed over 4000 dollars?

If you turned 18 (and were a resident in canada) in 2021, your contribution room is $6000. If you turned 18 in 2020, your contribution room is $6000+$6000=$12000. There is no *annual* contribution room limit - there is how much new contribution room you get each year, but you can always contribute up to your total unused contribution room. So if you turned 18 last year but made no contributions yet you can contribute $12000 today. 

If you turned 18 before 2009, and have been a resident of canada since 2009, you can contribute up to $75,500. If you have not always lived in Canada be careful -- the contribution room on your my cra account will be incorrect. 

Back to you though. Let's say you were born in 1991 or earlier and have always been a tax resident of Canada every year since and you've never made any contributions yet - your contribution room is $75,500 and you can deposit up to $75,500 right now. 

Do NOT go over your contribution room limit though. You will be charged a penalty of 1% per month on your overcontribution, you will be taxed on the over contribution and if they believe you've done this deliberately, they can actually tax you 100% of your gains (yes, you can lose all of your profit). Do NOT go over your limit.",1614556935

Hello Reddit.

my name is Matt, I have worked on a game by myself for the past six months called Otherfalls. I am happy to announce the first Alpha Demo is now available on SideQuest.

Otherfalls is a a surreal adventure that merges exploration, flying, and environmental storytelling. Players will explore mysterious dreamscapes, power up forgotten machinery, and venture through portals leading to the unknown.

The game is inspired by Myst, Journey, and LSD dream emulator, and has been built from the ground up for Oculus Quest 1 and 2:

Runs at 72 FPS on Quest 1

Runs at 90 FPS on Quest 2 with no FFR

Seated and Standing play modes

Basic Save System, Play in Multiple Sessions

Explore the dream world via standard teleport or free flying movement

The demo is about 30 mins of gameplay, and development is ongoing. I will be expanding the narrative in the game, and then adding expansion packs of random worlds to explore as sort of sandbox mode in the classic dream emulator style. This game is very special to me and my goal is to fill the void on quest platform of not having enough artistic exploration games.

In the sidequest description you will find all of our community links such as public discord, sidequest community, ways to support monetarily. (This demo is free but support is highly appreciated!). Supporters will receive a bunch of perks like alpha tester role in our discord and early access to future game builds.

Thank you checking out my game!

"The_Retail_Warzone","t5_4198h0","In general the bigger they are the worse they treat their managers. That's probably the case anywhere. Its just a rule of thumb.

There is a mix of company cultures that spill over as we have a lot of foreign retailers. German (aldi/lidl), UK (tesco) and many smaller outfits from Europe with a handful from the States and elsewhere. That's an interesting story in itself. 

In terms of how companies treat their managers; Management do more hours than their contracted to, the general rule is shit travels downhill. The atmosphere in the retail environment is either ruled by fear or total bullshit or a mix of the 2. Fear is easy to grasp I guess where your supposed to be terrified of your superiors and your employees are supposed to fear you. Bullshit is a little more nuance. Using bullshit as a motivator is a relatively new concept and takes the form of ""you get out what you put in"" and everything is ridiculous job or impossible task you are given is sold as a great ""experience"" to be used in the future. Kinda like retails version of karma points. But in essence both tactics are 2 cheeks of the same arse. They get you to do you job out of fear of being reprimanded or fear of missing some great ""opportunity"". Most companies are slowly beginning to use the bullshit tactics more. Managers are more often than not not really managers but long term salaried strike breakers as they increasingly do the exact same jobs as staff while corporate take over a larger and larger proportion of any autonomy managers had. The difference is managers tend not to strike.

There are pretty good protections in terms of employment law. So you can't just get fired because they don't like you. But as everywhere else what they will do is make you quit. They will move you to stores or departments that inconvenience you in the extreme or they will set you up to fail some other way. There are laws against this too but they are usually pretty good at making this work.

Shoplifters. Thats an easy one. Unlike the US (from what I've seen on YouTube and heard people discuss) it is a really bad idea to confront shoplifters. Private security contractors usually take this responsibility. If you stop a person and accuse them of stealing and they didn't you're fucked. 100% guarantee that you'll be sued and the courts here are not sympathetic. We got sued for 40k on my watch once because the security guard stopped a guy with a bottle of lighter fluid that they thought he stole. He didn't. And we were fucked and the security guard lost his job. So you will not see a retailer tackling shoplifters unless they are 1000% about it. My own policy is let it out. I record the footage and wait for them to come back. At least then I'll have leverage via the footage if anything goes wrong apprehending them the 2nd time.",1614556935

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am unsure how to feel about this because I can see both sides, but all media content about teenagers in TV shows and books having sex is written by adults - and I think this is not pedophilic if written about in a healthy way encouraging consent and is in fact educational for teenagers, because, let's be real, teenagers have sex.

However, the argument was specifically about a fanfiction written by an author in their 20s who is writing about two sixteen-year old students having sex, and does include mentions of kink (albeit in a consensual way).

We obviously can't put a stop to sexual content about teenagers being written by adults, because it's everywhere. But is there a line that shouldn't be crossed, even if it's just fiction?

I‚Äôve seen a shocking percentage of gun owners talking about overthrowing their own government.  About eliminating the government, outright exterminating liberals, blacks, Hispanics.  A long term friend who used to laugh at people who followed politics as idiots, became so radicalized listening to talk radio that be began talking about lining up people who cross the border and executing against the border wall and leaving their bodies as a warning.  He when on to say to say illegal immigrants should be given one month to leave before they‚Äôre killed.  I knew him for 45 years and I no longer speak to him.

In WandaVision, Hayward and SWORD are working on reactivating Vision. In his conversation with her, Hayward sort of implies that maybe Wanda could help them restart Vision. Instead she chooses to say goodbye and leaves peacefully. Then later, after setting up the Hex and the showdown, she herself unknowingly brings Hayward the very energy he would need to reactivate Vision, and probably cause herself more pain and problems in the next episode.

"stocks","t5_2qjfk","You do good to lay out all the costs and viability, I do know people have been successful in their vegetative/micro grows in the right market. My area is VERY sunny almost year round since we're right on the equator and so in my mind its immensely wasteful to generate new light when there's often too much light outside already.

I've thought a lot marrying hydro with outdoor buried grow medium/nutrient tanks, etc.. but on the other hand, the heat and sun intensity during the summer is still too extreme for many leaves to survive without sufficient shade. 

Of course with the right strategy for your crop and environment all these little costs, while adding up and cutting into your profit quite a bit, can be budgeted for and reduced enough that you do still profit. Just like utilizing solar panels to provide partial shade while also powering lights for 24hr grows could work well in practice but the upfront cost of such a trial is still a bit high just to grow some veg.

I suppose marijuana grow ops help fund a lot of the R&amp;D necessary to bring costs down for the rest of us. I've seen examples of mirrored or optical fiber like tunneling of sunlight through roofs into buildings, if cost permitted such a technique could work well in already air conditioned groceries stores.

But I suspect solar or wind generation would be used instead even with low market rates, which Texas generally is. ~5.3c/KWh if just to advertised they're fed ""green"" artificial sunlight. 

I'm just rambling now.",1614556939

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","I‚Äôm reminded üì£ of a rodeo üê¥. How accustomed these cowboys ü§† are to riding üçÜüèá‚è© their horses üê¥ and steed üêé. It‚Äôs second üïë nature üåø, handling üò≤ the canter, trot, and gallop of a horse üêé. But üçë in the ring üëÇ of the rodeo üê¥, the challenge üèã is to stay üíí seated üí∫ for at least üíØ eight 8Ô∏è‚É£ seconds ü•à before üòÇ being thrown üò± from the raging üò† animal üò∫. Suddenly üò±ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, the rider ‚ôø is faced üëÅ with the gargantuan üåã task üëæüò° of lasting üë¥üëµüë™ atop ‚èè what he‚Äôs felt üòÅ so natural üëâ mounting üóª up ‚òù til üíè now. No üôÖ longer üìè in control üéõ.   
  
The remnants üí∞üîï of my orgasm üí¶ linger üîõ in the air üå¨ and inside üí† me, somehow üòÜ beginning üîò to collect üëÇ back üîô together üë´üë∑üèø as I üëÅ shakily ü§ù move üöö up ‚¨Ü and down ‚¨á on üîõ Miss üòÇ Mae‚Äôs strap-on. I üëÅ wasn‚Äôt planning üéìüìë on üîõ being in this position üìç. Wasn‚Äôt planning üìù on üîõ cumming üí¶ onto üê¶ Miss üò≠ Mae‚Äôs stomach üòÇü§£ and breasts üçà. I üëÅ definitely ‚úäüèª wasn‚Äôt planning üìë on üîõ continuing ü§ó‚úçüèª to ride üòèüèá post-orgasm.   
  
While my movements üì¶ are not nearly üë£ those of those cowboys ü§† in the rodeo üê¥ and Miss üòÇ Mae is perhaps üòç the absolute üò§ antithesis to a raging üò† bull üí©; I üëÅ still üôÑüòΩ feel üòú as if I üë• am barely üêª able üí™ to hold üõÇ on üîõ. Every ‚òù muscle üí™üèª in my body üíÉ feels üòÅ ragged and weak üëãüë∂üèª, I üëÅ tremble üéÑ with my every üíØü§¨ movement üë£.   
  
Miss üò≠ Mae‚Äôs hands ‚úã stroll üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è along üíÅ my legs üëê and up ‚¨Ü my stomach üòÆ, over üò≥üôäüí¶ my chest üíì and back ‚¨Ö down ‚¨á along üï∫üíÉ my legs üçó. My mind‚Äôs eye üëÄ chases üèÉüôÑ after üëÄ her üë© touch ‚úã while I üë• struggle ‚öîüò´ to keep üëå focus üîé on üîõ anything üòØ beyond üëÜ this overwhelming üåäü§§ inability to grasp ‚úäüí™üò´ any semblance of control üéÆüé≠üôÖüèº.   
  
‚ÄúSuch a good üëçüëå boy üë¶, how do you üëà feel?‚Äù   
  
*Spent üòµ and frayed.*   
  
‚ÄúOh god.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúWhat is it baby?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... too.‚Äù I üëÅ whimper üò≠ and shiver ‚ùÑ. ‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre doing so good üëçüëå, riding üèáüò≥üòú me like üòÑ such a good üëå boy.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúJesus. Fuck.‚Äù   
  
She üë© begins üîò to thrust üòÇ more firmly üö¨ up ‚¨Ü into me, each time ‚è∞üï∞‚åõ I üëÅ lower üòåüò§üòé myself she üë©üèΩ matches üëâ it with a meeting ü§ù of our bodies üíÉ that punctuates üòî the room üíØ with a loud üîä smack üëã.   
  
A feeling üòé, an urge üçÜüí¶, begins üîò to swell üí© inside üí† me. Like üëç I üëÅ need üëâ to dismount, to escape üèÉüèª. And yet üòá there is an urgency üçÜüí¶ to continue ‚ùìüò°üò§. As if something ‚ùìü§î somewhere üíç inside üí† me needs üëâ this. I üëÅüñê feel üòúüëâüçÜ every üíØü§¨ bit üòÅ the mess üí¶ I‚Äôve just made üëë on üîõ Katherine‚Äôs body üòçüëó: warm üî•, puddled, gooey üíØ.   
  
My breathing üå¨ intensifies üéÜüåüüí• as I üëÅ work üíº toward üîú this indescribable üõÇüî´üö¥üèΩ need üëâ. Miss üò≠ Mae grabs 1‚É£ hold üë´ of my hips üï∫ and squeezes üôÄü§£ me tightly üëâ, my cock üçÜü¶ä and balls üçí flop ‚§µ against üö´ her üë∏ with each deepened and strengthened thrust üò´.   
  
Each exhale üí® seems üëÄ to escape üèÉüÜì with the crashing ‚òÑ down ‚¨á of my hips üï∫ into Miss üò≠ Mae and is punctuated by a squeak üê∑ of a moan üò©, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too much üî•. I üë• can‚Äôt.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúKeep going üëâüèº. Fuck üëâ, you üëà look üëÄ so beautiful.‚Äù   
  
My back üîô tightens üóú as my head üíÜ tilts ‚Üó backward ‚óÄ. Extending üëâüèºüëåüèº my arms üí™ is, itself, an undertaking ü™ì‚òé but üçë I üëÅ successfully üìà reach üëâ out as my hands ‚úã grasp ‚úäüí™üò´ Miss üòÇ Mae‚Äôs legs üçóüîõ. The new üëåüèΩ angle üìê that she üë© penetrates üëâ me amplifies the indescribable ü§ê sensation üôèüí∞. I üëÅ feel üòÅ her üë© watching ‚åöüëéüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è me, feel üòú her üë© fascination üí≠. It‚Äôs almost üí¶ as if I üëÅ am the bull üí© and she üë© the cowboy ü§†. The animal üò∫ inside üí† me nearly üë£ uncontrollable üò©, were it not for her üë©.   
  
Her üë© right üëå hand ü§≤ leaves üåø my hip üï∫ and once again üò¨ finds üî≠ my cock üçÜüí¶. It‚Äôs wet üíß with my arousal üè† and I üëÅ haggardly üë¥üèº mumble üêï a whimpered plea üÖ±, ‚Äúahh, please üôè. It‚Äôs too much.‚Äù   
  
He üë® quickly üèÉüèªüí® responds üì• to her üë© touch ‚úã, my ass üçë muscles üí™ tensing involuntarily üò≥, quickening üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the whole üí¶ process üè≠.   
  
‚ÄúOh baby üë∂, such a good üëåüíª boy üë∂ for me.‚Äù   
  
I üë• start üÜï to question ‚ùì if she üë© is talking üó£ to me or my cock ‚≠ïüçÜ. I‚Äôm unable üö´ to catch üôã my breathe üò§, feel üòú as though ü§î I‚Äôm chasing üèÉüèΩüòà the present üéÅ, just seconds üïê‚ùóüëâ behind üëüüí• all üíØ of it. *Oh üôÄ my god üòá! Holy ‚úù fucking üñïüë¶ hell üî•!*   
  
I üëÅ tilt ‚Üó my head üíÜ back üîô down ‚¨á and see üëÅ her üë© focus üîé, her üë© determination üò§. She üë© is expectant üëÄüò± and she üë© looks üëÄ up ‚¨Ü from my cock üêì to penetrate üëâ my eyes üëÅ. They travel üó∫‚úàüõ© right üëå to my core üåé and I üë• buckle, sounds üîä I‚Äôve never ‚ùå heard üëÇüîäüí• before üòÇ, never üö´ made üëâ before üòÇ spew üòùü§¢ from my lips üëÑ.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. C‚Äômon baby.‚Äù Her üë© strokes üò∞ quicken üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è around üß±üé∂üéµ my throbbing üí¢ cock üçÜüí¶. *I üëÅ can‚Äôt, no üò£, oh üôÄ god üôèüòá. Oh üò≥ fuck üëâ.*   
  
Suddenly üò±ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è her üë∏ dildo üçÜ is hitting üëä a spot ‚≠ï in me that sends üì®üìß a flight ‚úà signal üö¶ to my brain üß†. *Too much üî•, too much üî•!*   
  
But üçë I üëÅ am rooted üå± on üîõ her üòÖüë∏, I üëÅ want üòã to be her üë© good üëå boy üë¶üèø, I üëÅ beg üò©üëÄüí¨ and plead üòì with myself. The desire üêÖ consumes üëÖ me and as she üë© hits üëä that spot ‚≠ï each time üïê I üëÅ fall üçÇ into her üë© lap üëßüèæ‚úãüèøüè™, her üë© hand ü§≤ tightens üóú just enough üí¶ around üîÉ my cock üçÜ. My balls üèÄ tighten üóú once again üò¨ and I üëÅ am spewing ü§¢ my second 6‚É£üïë orgasm üíÄ into her üë© hand ‚úã and onto üê¶ her üëâüèΩüë© stomach üòÇü§£.   
  
I üëÅ hump üê´üê™ and grind üò´ on üëÖüí¶ her üë© lap üê∂üÜô, dumb üëÖ and chaotic üí• with euphoria üòç. She üë© is praising üôå me and I üë• am glowing üò≥, my entire üé¨ body üòçüôå feeling üòÅ as though üí• I üëÅ am asleep üò¥ and yet üòá never ‚ùå more woke üëÄ.   
  
Time ‚è∞ ceases ‚ùå to exist üôÑüò¨üòÇ, I üëÅ ride üé∏üòéüèá this wave üåä of ecstasy üò´ and it extends üëÄ, ebbing and flowing üåäüèû with the beating üëä of our bodies üíÉ. I üëÅ slow üê¢, utterly üêÑ exhausted and weak üë∂.   
  
I üëÅ collapse üëπ onto üòÇ her üë∏, her üë© dildo üçÜüí¶ flopping üò∑üí© from my ass üçë.   
  
‚ÄúOh my god üòá, holy üôè‚ú®... holy ‚úù shit üí©. That was.‚Äù I üëÅ am breathless, ‚Äúthat was.‚Äù

If they want to keep Ellie, professional training is an absolute must. If not, finding a rescue that specializes in dogs with problematic histories would be good. Either way, when discussing with a trainer or rescue, your parents need to be very clear about the exact circumstances leading to the incident - how the dogs acted toward each other previously, what happened that may have triggered the incident, does Ellie display a high prey drive, if Ellie or Reese were feeling under the weather/acting strangely recently, etc. In the meantime, isolating Ellie and muzzle training here would be beneficial, but make sure she isn't completely shut out or ignored. Having no contact may only hurt her mindset even further and make her more nervous, skittish or defensive around others.

Looksmatch is never going to happen in dating if someone has better options that is a good blackpill point that this video proves. If someone who is worse looking then you can get access to someone better looking they will not date on their level. If a woman who is not fat and a 5 can get a guy who is a 7 or 8 to date them they aren't going to date a 5. 

At the end of the day women are only as loyal as their options and since women can date someone better looking than themselves since dating is easier for them they're always gonna go for the best option that is usually out of their league. The only choice for non-hot, average guys like trp said a long time ago is you gotta get lucky and be at the right place at the right time.

Yes, trials loot needs to be way more accessible. Every piece of loot (armor/weapon) should be obtainable in a reasonable period of time with a reasonable amount of effort. There needs to be a massive overhaul to these systems. At the same time, there should be meaningful rewards that are only available to ""the best"". These rewards shouldn't be weapons but ornaments, shaders, ships, titles, etc. I hate the adept system but considering it's not going away, adept as well. People who have truly ""mastered"" an avenue of the game should have some in game way to flex it, whether it be stuff from flawless card only or flawless raid only etc. I just feel a lot of posts demand flawless needs to be more accessible whereas I think the loot needs to be accessible, but flawless should remain something prestigious.",1614556941

How's that working out lately? Been any news stories about police not following the law lately. I've been in a coma for the last 40 years so I've missed some things. Did they make a law that finally stopped people from murdering and raping? Cause when I went into my coma there were laws making those illegal but they were still happening.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","&gt; I'm really confused by this... doesn't the restaurant have to agree to the various delivery apps terms?

No. They're two completely different entities.

&gt; It's not like GH or DD can offer discounts, call in an order and demand the discounted price.

See below.

&gt; I'm not defending the apps here but if a business owner is mad you are using a delivery app rather than their website they should just not accept GH/DD orders.

The way that Grubhub and Doordash work is that they just get the menu of the restaurant, they post it online, then they send delivery drivers to pick up the food. The restaurants don't ""sign up"" to participate in the program. They DO offer partner programs, but even if the restaurants AREN'T partnered, they'll still put them on their website.

Some restaurants promote Doordash and Grubhub because it's additional business. But a lot of them resent the companies, because it's incentivizing people to eat at home. For instance, I managed a restaurant for about four years, and there's absolutely no way we would have been profitable without sales from the bar. If you ordered food and had water to drink, we would not break even. If two people come in and spend $50 on dinner, and $20 of the tab is booze, the profit on the booze is about $15. So on a $50 tab, 30% of the profit is booze. On a $30 tab with no booze, we're likely losing money. Even a Coca Cola can be the difference between profit and loss; a soda is about 90% profit.

None of the food delivery companies are profitable. For every dollar that Door Dash collects, [it loses over 50% of it.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/doordash-releases-s-1-for-ipo.html)

This is a lot like the situation with Amazon, early on, when a lot of retailers didn't want to partner with them, because they could see that Amazon was going to eat them alive. Then again, a lot of them were compelled to do business with Amazon because it's hard to turn away a sale. The weird thing about Door Dash and Grubhub is that the restaurants didn't sign up for this; it was just pushed on them. If a driver shows up and paid for food, the restaurant is compelled to do the deal, even if it might hurt them in the long run.

https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113876/grubhub-seamless-fake-restaurant-listings-no-permission-postmates-doordash

*""Grubhub owns multiple food directory services ‚Äî including Seamless, Eat24, MenuPages, and AllMenus ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not alone in this practice. Competing services Postmates and DoorDash also host restaurant listings and their menus on their platform even if those businesses don‚Äôt offer delivery or have never agreed to partner with those services; a practice that both companies have implemented for several years.*

*Postmates claims that technically it doesn‚Äôt need explicit partnerships from restaurants. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a pick-up service representing the customer; we‚Äôre not a delivery service representing the restaurant. There‚Äôs a big difference,‚Äù Anand Dass, Postmates‚Äô director of business development, told Eater last July.""*",1614556944

I think, though, the only way that the twist functions is if teams are forced to act against each other while still together. If there's no inter-team stakes then I don't know how well the team will work. For example, if someone on the winning team is HOH, it probably wouldn't be nearly as interesting because then the two nominated players could be like ""Oh I hate Team So-and-So!"" and then band together stronger. If someone on the losing team wins HOH, though, that'd be incredibly high stakes because the team is forced to turn on each other for safety.

One thing think about it if your married or even just have a girlfriend how would she ever know if your using her information?

I have a lot of stuff Operating Systems on USB's that I use when hacking none of it is me. I keep them in the bathroom I hear some banging and they get flushed.

I don't do it for money I get into people's stuff load it up with porn and point out how they should be careful. I like messing with people notnhurtimg them.

I personally wouldn't use anything connected to me especially not a wife or girlfriend because it's going to get tracked. 

If your smart you want to use something viable like and I never used this but David Wilkenson or Todd Bennett let them track a viable name preferably someone in another area.

Search a news paper from Michigan or the New York Post whatever just so that person exists somewhere.

Maybe your guy didn't put that much thought into it. He could have just said he it's not me. That's a bad mistake though why bring the police to your house?

"numenera","t5_2w096","If you let your players just do as they want, it will absolutely break the balance. 

I would not allow it. It breaks the immersion of the world, imo, and frankly leads to builds that are skewed in one direction too far. 

Even having 2 Effort for first advancement buy is tricky. Can be amazing, but yes, you will find your pools depleted quickly. And if you play RAW, 10 hour rests do not reset pools like some people think, but act only as another Recovery roll. At first Tier, that is likely still 1d6+1 (maybe a few PCs because of Descriptor or Focus it might be higher, but that averages out to 4-5 a roll.) 

Given you start with around 36 total of Pools combined, healing 24-30 leaves you needing still further heals and resting. As a player, it might not be a bad thing (depending on pace of the game, you might have a few days to rest and recover but given the idea the world is dangerous and that GM Intrusions are exactly for this purpose, if your players are using rests to fully recover while being out in dangerous areas that is on you but I would toss an Intrusion at them to keep the pace tense). 

Once you grab a +2 to Recovery rolls as optional advancement, it is easier to recover fully and more often and this is less an issue. 

Edge is supposed to be limited to 6 (some Foci may break this, but as GM I would encourage the PC to spread it to one of the other Pools since all 3 are ultimately important one way or another). 

Having Edge too high too quickly breaks the balance again, but even at Effort 3 a max 6 Edge will still leave you paying 1 from a pool. 

Spending an advancement on increasing Pools is my LEAST important buy, imo, because so many othrr Decriptors and Foci grant Pool bonuses, and Recovery rolls, Armor costs lessened and skills are so much more valuable. 

If PCs could go crazy buying skills, they could too easily get specialized in a wide amount and thus upset the idea of them being usually focused in their skills (excepting Jacks since this is by design).

Otherwise, I think sticking to the original model is best and there are plenty of optional buys (especially if you include Destiny and Building Tomorrow stuff regarding Downtime), but I also never had issues with players spending XP for short term things in game (as it usually means I have more opportunties to use a GM Intrusion later to pay the player's back for spending XP on rerolls or in game narrative bonuses).",1614556945

"jaycemains","t5_37wcr","When I first started playing Jayce, I thought the same thing. It seems like an absolutely sound idea at first having basically a built in Hail of Blades, and being a ranged top laner it's not completely foreign to think of PTA, but there are a few snags in this theory.

1. Using it in the first place requires you to absolutely demolish levels 1-5, because that rune will not help you in the slightest beyond that point. It's too hard to proc outside of laning due to being heavily reliant on your ranged Q &gt; E, and going too far in being a death sentance.
2. It's outclassed by literally every other keystone. If you want early game burst, Electro gives similar damage at the cost of a higher cooldown, but the upside being it is still useful in mid-lategame. Also, with the bug that allows Eclipse to proc off of one Q&gt;E if you take Aery + Eclipse + Black Cleaver, Aery gives the early game poke you may be looking for, while also bringing a mean lategame poke. The other options are literally just better.
3. Forget about using it in ranged matchups, which of there are plenty in the Midlane. If you're absolutely dead set on PTA, it's gotta be Top, which is not exactly known as a place where Jayce can easily demolish the early game (As effectively as Mid).

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying PTA is absolutely troll, I'm sure there may be a practical use I'm just not thinking of, but generally you won't want to default to it. Maybe if your Jungler says in pre-game that he intends on lvl 2 ganking, that cheap and consistent lvl 1 poke may just be what you need. I absolutely love this champion with all my heart, so any discussion on new ways to play him is a blast. Thank you!",1614556946

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I remember the days circa 2015 when I hadn't seen ""snowflake"" being used as an insult outside of reddit, and it had a different meaning then.

There are kids who are just assholes, but their dumbass parents think they're special and unique. So if you're say, a teacher, you have to deal with the kid being a troublemaker, an asshole, and their schoolwork is shit. Then when you write them up, the parents come in and say it's their expression, and that none of the horrifying shit they're putting the teachers and other kids through is their fault, and it's YOU smothering the kid as an individual. All this unheard of behavior is just him being *a unique snowflake*. That's what it meant back then, I also think it was always prefaced by unique.

Then of course you have rednecks hearing it and misusing it because they either associate with frailness or because social/political views of most city people sound so fucking out of ordinary in whatever backwoods shithole they just internet in.

Then it doesn't stop there, it waters down to a response to just about any kind perceived insecurity or taken offense or whatever.

And it just goes even more downhill where it's just a generic insult. No meaning to it at all whatsoever anymore. I got called a snowflake for not liking moobs.",1614556946

&gt;As a child, Raku Ichijo made a secret promise with his childhood sweetheart, keeping a pendant as a memento while his love took the key. He dreams of one day meeting his past love, but years later, reality smashes his hopes when Chitoge Kirisaki accidentally knees him in the face...

&gt;Though Raku&amp;rsquo;s a normal high schooler, his family heads the notorious yakuza gang the Shuei-Gumi faction! And he&amp;rsquo;s dragged into family affairs when he&amp;rsquo;s forced into a relationship with Chitoge, the daughter of a rival gang&amp;rsquo;s boss!

&gt;Despite their constant spats, the two somehow fool everyone with their false relationship. Raku then discovers that Chitoge has a mysterious key from her past, which she can&amp;rsquo;t remember... Plus, two other girls appear with keys as well&amp;mdash;Kosaki Onodera and Marika Tachibana!

&gt;Caught in the midst of this love maelstrom, even more complications arise for Raku when his class decides on Romeo and Juliet as the class&amp;rsquo;s play for the school festival. Can the two false lovebirds pull off the impossible and make the play a success?

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Because going to your bosses, and their bosses the investors and saying ""hey we fucked up this project we worked on for the past year isn't working and the player dissatisfaction will result in some more people quitting but oh well whoopsie"" will result in people getting the sack.

It's true for the whole world, I can vouch for civil construction contractors too as that's the field I'm in; no one admits to fuck ups, they will throw someone else under the bus and manipulate their results to draw attention away from anything that may result in them losing their jobs.

Understandable though, of course you should protect your jobs. But their bosses need to grow a pair and smell the bull shit. The best bosses already know the results and how well you did, then they just want to hear if you lie to them and try to justify your fuck ups or if you come in, admit you fucked up, and propose how you want to fix it. If you do the latter, you should keep your job. Riot HQ seems to do the former.",1614556950

"GODZILLA","t5_2ruhk","Thank you for this.

Godzilla is 'King of the Monsters' not 'Barely King of the Monsters'.  In order for Godzilla to be considered king, his position has to be unrivaled.  Now Kong just waltzes in, and is or almost is Godzillas equal?  That takes so much away from Godzilla, all of his achievements and his status.

Also consider, who saved the planet from the Mutos?  Godzilla.  Who saved the planet again from Ghidora?  Godzilla.  Where was Kong?  Chilling on his island.  Godzilla was the one who stepped up, Kong didnt give a shit.  And now its Kong thats the hero?  Now hes the one stealing the spotlight?  I feel like Im the only one thats annoyed by this.

It also feels unfair towards Godzilla, that Kong gets all beefed up and buffed, and Godzilla doesnt.  In order for Kong to fight Godzilla evenly, they had to boost him incredibly.  It just makes it feel like a disingenuous fight, since its not really Godzilla vs Kong, its more like Godzilla vs Super Mega Ultra Kong.  All it does for me, is take Godzilla down a bunch of pegs.  Its like in wrestling, you have a character like Goldberg, who was unstoppable, and then he suddenly looses to some scrawny weakling nobody named Bob.  It doesnt feel real, even for fake wrestling.",1614556950

"virtualreality","t5_2qp9o","While facebook‚Äôs shady reputation with privacy is concerning, I personally don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs any damage that can cause me. I post on Facebook like twice a year and don‚Äôt really consider myself an easily swayed consumer and vulnerable to targeted ads. If they want to waste resources tracking my purchases and my single annual status update then the jokes on them. I‚Äôd only be concerned about the inside out tracking since it‚Äôs basically an eye into my living space, but I only play in our guest room and it‚Äôs basically empty now that I converted it into my VR space.  
  
As far as a the closed ecosystem and anticompetitive practices, I really don‚Äôt see as strong of a case for it now that oculus has allowed VD to have the VR patch from the get-go for those that bought it on the oculus store. Now anyone with a PC can just cast games to their headset and never spend a dime in the oculus store. You can even get VD on sidequest and literally never give oculus any more money than what it cost to buy your quest.  If you want stand alone games for traveling you can use sidequest too.  
  
Overall I think them spearheading affordable and quality standalone VR solutions is just the beginning of the mainstream wave. I can see a lot of competitors rising to meet the quest head to head, and with additional insight since they can learn from Oculus‚Äôs mistakes without spending the money to gather competitive knowledge. No longer are the days of having VR cost $1-2k+. I personally went with the Q2 because even with my upgrades and accessories it cost me half of what I would‚Äôve spent on an index, and I can play pcvr games over WiFi with I side out tracking.",1614556950

"politics","t5_2cneq","Exactly. If you guys don't want this new wave of voter suppression and gerrymandering to happen, contact your representatives and tell them to vote for HR1. 

HR1 will fight Voter Suppression in several ways:

* It will require Automatic Voter Registration and Same Day Registration
* It will mandate Early Voting and make Election Day a holiday
* It will require states to offer a sworn statement option for voting if a voter does not have an ID 

If you want to educate yourself, [I made a video about the issue](https://youtu.be/7cRUGdXoMmE) (about 10 min long) as well as a [series about other ways to fix American Democracy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVSEBSpEEY-t3CSuVA42-gSvUi1843n6n).",1614556950

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","The people ITT saying that it‚Äôd only take a few hundred thousand people to make Wyoming or the Dakotas a majority black state are doing their math wrong. 

Wyoming currently has 9,200 black residents out of 578,000 residents total. Meaning that Wyoming would need 570,000 black people minimum to move there to be a majority black state. Then Wyoming would have 1,148,000 residents of which 579,200 of them would be black, constituting barely over 50.1% of the Wyoming population. 

Delaware has 223,000 black residents out of 970,000 total. Meaning that Delaware would need only 540,000 black people to move there to become 50.1% black. 

Mississippi would also be a good choice as they have 1,140,000 black residents out of 3,000,000 residents total. That means if 740,000 black people moved there they‚Äôd be 1,880,000 out of 3,740,000 residents total or 50.1% of the residents. They‚Äôd also have a few more electoral votes and House members than Wyoming or Delaware.  

If the goal isn‚Äôt a black majority, but rather moving to flip states from red to blue it‚Äôd be smarter to spread out between Georgia, South Carolina, and Mississippi.",1614556951

Hello Reddit.

my name is Matt, I have worked on a game by myself for the past six months called Otherfalls. I am happy to announce the first Alpha Demo is now available on SideQuest.

Otherfalls is a a surreal adventure that merges exploration, flying, and environmental storytelling. Players will explore mysterious dreamscapes, power up forgotten machinery, and venture through portals leading to the unknown.

The game is inspired by Myst, Journey, and LSD dream emulator, and has been built from the ground up for Oculus Quest 1 and 2:

Runs at 72 FPS on Quest 1

Runs at 90 FPS on Quest 2 with no FFR

Seated and Standing play modes

Basic Save System, Play in Multiple Sessions

Explore the dream world via standard teleport or free flying movement

The demo is about 30 mins of gameplay, and development is ongoing. I will be expanding the narrative in the game, and then adding expansion packs of random worlds to explore as sort of sandbox mode in the classic dream emulator style. This game is very special to me and my goal is to fill the void on quest platform of not having enough artistic exploration games.

In the sidequest description you will find all of our community links such as public discord, sidequest community, ways to support monetarily. (This demo is free but support is highly appreciated!). Supporters will receive a bunch of perks like alpha tester role in our discord and early access to future game builds.

Thank you checking out my game!

"investing","t5_2qhhq","Right you are, I tried ignoring the econpapers paywall warning and it works perfectly.

As I understood it the paper argues that returns correlate to the proposed factors (DIV, LEV, SEP) and therefore the factors identify risk. That's plausible if you already believe the premise that risk==return but doesn't demonstrate this is the case.

Notably they picked a relatively short period of stock market history in which value had high returns (see page 10 [here](http://johncbogle.com/speeches/JCB_Phila_Ana_2-01.pdf)). Presumably the same analysis on data from 20 years earlier would produce a contrary result.

A more fundamental issue - what does risk actually mean if the market is efficient? If prices always reflect expected return, the only answer to that is that risk is a wider distribution of returns. Risk premium results from the utility functions of market participants weighing losses more heavily than gains (relative to the risk-free return). If that is the case then the measurable consequence of risk in an efficient market is higher variance of returns coupled with a higher mean. A higher mean without higher variance would be strong evidence *against* the efficient market hypothesis.

If I understood correctly this wasn't looked at in the paper - only prior earnings variance was considered (SEP).

Is there anything showing correlation between factors, returns, and return variance over a reasonable time period?",1614556951

&gt; So to try and add some context to what is going on here, I'll try to guesstimate how it should be working:
I've been unable to find pictures of the T55E1 with its front wheels turned a lot but looking at the X-Ray view and the way the whole thing is set up, it's supposed to steer more like a train. Which would mean the two front left and front right wheels are always in line, there is only a central pivot point (which is where the drive sprockets are mounted to the transmission) and the whole set of wheels rotates around that point so the chains are always going straight. So they're set up like a proper bogie.

&gt; However, this is not happening here. The front wheels turn a lot, and the ones behind turn only a little while the drive chains stay absolutely straight which results in the clipping issue.",1614556952

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Okay so the first thing, we can then conclude the discussion as the verse in Mathew as what? Particular as I assume (as I don't see days or ""period of day, and period of night"" described in other parts of the Scripture as ""Sun stoppings"" or people conversing in any texts of the time as ""I'll see you after the sun has stopped, take care dude"".

In Matthew? I'm very confused about your point here.

As for the word used, you can look it up here to see how it's variously translated: [Strong's Hebrew: 1826. ◊ì÷∏÷º◊û÷∑◊ù (damam) -- cease (biblehub.com)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1826.htm) 

It ranges from stopping, to silent, to ceasing / resting, to standing still. It's something like you stop doing what you're doing. And that's the word for ""stood still"". Then there's obviously the other clearer word for ""stopped"".

If the sun is a light in the sky, and the light stops, I think it's far more likely they are talking about the light going out.

As for the idioms in Hebrew about what the sun does, it ranges from things like setting, to going in, to going down. 

&gt;As far are divine inspiration, if you hold to the idea these texts are in fact divine origination - I don't see how effective as a message it would be, to be as confusing as we're now having it demonstrated to be, as to not have settlement on something as simple as reference to the transpiring of a what we would deem to be ""a day"". It doesn't matter if there were 3 periods in a day, or 4, or 5. 

I'm not confused. You're raising an objection and I'm responding. I don't think that's confusing.

&gt;Sure if you read the entire verse, and understood as I said prior, that the event transpired for an entire day (unless you want to say the term ""day"" used in the same passage, refers to something entirely different than AT LEAST a 12-hour period going by your 2-period per day statement). If there was an eclipse, it would have to be at least an eclipse lasting at least one of the 2-periods. If there is an eclipse, the Sun stops, but the stopping would have to be this unbelievable duration (either 24 hours, or the ""day"" you talk about being 12 hours). Give or take a few hours for winter/summer periods as you please. 

Correct. Read Genesis 1 to see how an Israelite defines a day:

""God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light ‚Äúday,‚Äù and the darkness he called ‚Äúnight.‚Äù""

""Day"" is light. When it's light outside, it's ""day"". When it's dark, it's ""night"". We might use those terms to mean something like ""The time of the rotation of the planet when the sun is on the opposite side of the world"", but that simply wasn't their definition.

&gt;As bilingual, this resonates personally. The problem is, it has to be established that what you're talking about is commonplace as a descriptor for such an event. So if you have ""sun stoppings"" that appear more commonly than not to describe what we think of as an eclipse - then your theory holds more merit than not.

Awesome! Because I've been learning Hebrew for about the last year and a half, and often you come across these terms which have these very different cultural meanings. The issue here is what does it mean for a sun to stand? That same word is used when women stop having children - they stand still. This is obviously metaphorical - the author is saying that in terms of child bearing, that practice has ceased.

Are there references in the Bible to the sun ceasing (different words, though)? Yes. Genesis 8 is one example. You could talk about the sun and moon stopping to refer to their function as lights stopping. It doesn't mean the planet would stop rotating.

And remember, if we're talking about a long day, it would make zero sense to mention the moon in the passage. However, the request comes as the sun and the moon are in differing places in the day sky - what happens next is the sun stops in the middle of the sky. It just really sounds like an eclipse to me.

&gt;It would be weird though as you say, if that was what they said (they didn't say the Sun stopped being the Sun, they said it simply stopped, which denotes a motion component more than it does a visual morph). And again even if they literally described it as an eclipse, as I said multiple times - the verse talks about the event happening for an entire day period. That then would be far more weird as I don't know of any eclipses with duration of that length. 

No one had watches back then. A ""day"" is the time when the sky is bright. What was delayed was the sun going down - that is, sunset. There were two periods of day during this text, split by the sun and the moon stopping in the middle of the sky.

Try giving this a watch:  [\[HD\] Total Solar Eclipse: Daylight turns to Night - Our Total Eclipse Experience - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O1foVF1QFo)

While you do, try to cast your mind back to being an ancient person. Forget about divine inspiration for the moment. Would you seriously consider that someone who experienced that would not say something like ""The sun and the moon were in the daytime sky. The sun stopped and there was another day after""? Because that makes total sense to me.

&gt;""(whatever that may mean)"" is the topic of contention though? Also, you don't have to listen to me, in the same way you're not listening to them when you make your assumption. For your eclipse theory to hold, you would have to prove (by ""listening to them"") that the people of the time meant eclipse explicitly whenever they said ""Sun Stopped"". If you can do that, then my theory holds far less merit than yours. The whole reason I protest to your notion, is because I've not seen an eclipse, nor ""a day"" described in this way anywhere else. So if you can get experts on the language who make such a case as you are, then you're gold. Otherwise, I see no reason to take your argument (and there are problems I outlined even if I did, like a day-long, or 12 hours long eclipse).

Yes, of course. This isn't a theory I came up with, but came across reading about it from an Old Testament scholar called John Walton. You can read his case for it here:  [Biblical Credibility and Joshua 10: What Does the Text Really Claim? - Articles - BioLogos](https://biologos.org/articles/biblical-credibility-and-joshua-10-what-does-the-text-really-claim) 

&gt;Yeah, I don't usually take people to be imbeciles who were able to author books in that period. Nor could I because they were formally educated individuals. But to assume that there was an eclipse for a day, from the people who believed in the geocentric point of view - and to say that's what ""stopping the sun"" means, they would then in fact have to be imbeciles on the multiple fronts I presented in my prior post, or more believably, people making up things (as was par for the course) as I take many parts of Scripture to be.

 I don't see that case at all, though. I think you're still trying to shove ""day = 12 or 24 hours"" into the text, but that's not how they operated.",1614556952

And I definitely did not feel safe having sex, so pushing it would be a huge boundary breaker for me. My partner in recovery needed to learn the way he thinks of sex is unhealthy. Sex is to connect not to ‚Äúget off‚Äù. So he needed to learn that we could connect in other ways and that he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù sex. He needed healthy coping strategies and needed to learn intimacy is so much more than the act of sex.",1614556953

For us, it was easy. Money. But that's the wrong answer.

For example a better answer that some dudes had were like *I'm doing this so that I can pay at least half my mortgage so then I can get a city job and be home with my family.*

So ask yourself every day why you are doing it.

Try to also challenge yourself to come up with one thing everyday about something new that you learned.

Delaying the crash only makes the future crash even larger as the system becomes even more dependant on even lower rates. But as you say nobody wants to let it happen on their watch, more than happy for it to happen on the next persons.

I‚Äôd bet money he was talking with his buddies, they hyped him up, and he walked over and shoved the dude. Even if he had been running away, 22 was going to throw him to the ground.

I‚Äôve seen this shit with entry level security guards, I‚Äôve seen it with tenured cops, and I‚Äôve seen it with any weak human given the smallest amount of authority. He did it because he could, nobody is gonna stop him. And if the crowd recasts with more than yelling, you‚Äôd better believe they are gonna cross that line again.
It‚Äôs really fucking shameful. 
I can understand that response if these people were doing something wrong, but they aren‚Äôt.
Why is 22 so determined to fight? 
What aspect of his mind was played to get him to act this way, and this goes for any cop.
What the fuck are you doing.
Why are you hurting civilians who‚Äôve done nothing wrong.
What are you defending?
Why?
None of these answers will ever make sense. I feel bad for everyone who has ever been abused by cops, and everyone who is currently being abused by the system and it‚Äôs fingers.
It‚Äôs a shame, because if only they‚Äôd work with us, change could happen quickly, with minimal violence.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Once in the polishing stones (5000 and beyond), all scratches on the bevel will be taken care of.

Looking closely at your knife, I‚Äôve noticed marks going vertically all along the whole blade (probably from a stone wheel or belt sander in production) and that‚Äôs the first thing I do when receiving a new knife. Getting rid of them.",1614556958

1. Here I fully agree with loverofchoons. Make sure you don‚Äôt integrate too heavily to another backend service, you might want to switch partners at some point and it could become almost impossible. 
2. Usually these companies proudly present 3 months as the time from agreement to delivery. The sales cycles are always getting shorter as well. I‚Äôd guess 3-5 months to get things up without too much customization required. 
3. No. BaaS services provide the licence and you pay them for using it.
4. Get your clients verified before moving money, alot of countries now have a simple national e-authentication methods but with other countries users need to upload a driving license or passport. Make sure you pair that with a legit face scanner. Make sure ALL transactions are paired between two known entities, for example don‚Äôt allow money to pile up in your system and then move as one payment to the recipient. Unless you know how to do it securely. Your BaaS peovider will probably set the rules for you and make sure you comply.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Getting an education cannot be a personal responsibility if it can be denied to you by others on the basis of what you do not control, and education is part of how we learn to control ourselves and our environment. So you're putting people in a catch 22 here. 

If education is the path to money and money is the path to education we have a problem. Even if something like ""merit"" is the basis, you still have a problem where the merit of an individual is partly determined by the quality of their upbringing and even access to basic material resources.

We can see that in order to even recognize the value of an education and ""be worthy of it"", you'd already need to be raised well. How far do we go down this path of blaming and punishing individuals? If I am a child, would you say to me I ought to've made myself worth better parents and punish me for my shortcomings?

You're effectively saying to people something like: ""get educated so you can be worth educating, oh and also get money so you can get educated to get money"".

At some point a person isn't simply responsible for themselves. They become responsible for themselves only after being helped by others. When this help is not given, we cannot hold them any more personally responsible than we'd hold a child responsible for failing to parent itself, or even a baby not feeding itself.

No one simply starts out worthy of anything, so at bottom the politics of shame and blame become counter productive and pointlessly punitive.",1614556960

My breathing intensifies as I work toward this indescribable need üßøü§çüòå  Miss Mae grabs hold of my hips and squeezes me tightly üëÖüçÜü§§ my cock and balls flop against her with each deepened and strengthened thrust üòãüòõüëÖ

Each exhale seems to escape with the crashing down of my hips into Miss Mae and is punctuated by a squeak of a moan üôäüí© ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too much üòïüòê  I can‚Äôt üòê‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep going üî™  Fuck üòàüòãüö© you look so beautiful üíòüòçü§©‚Äù

My back tightens as my head tilts backward üö¨  Extending my arms is üîëüéØ itself üî´üí¢üî® an undertaking but I successfully reach out as my hands grasp Miss Mae‚Äôs legs üò¨üò∂üòñ  The new angle that she penetrates me amplifies the indescribable sensation üò±üòµüò≥  I feel her watching me üôÉüëÑüòñ feel her fascination üî´  It‚Äôs almost as if I am the bull and she the cowboy üêÇüêÆ  The animal inside me nearly uncontrollable üê¥ were it not for her üòêüòï

Her right hand leaves my hip and once again finds my cock üçÜüëÖ  It‚Äôs wet with my arousal and I haggardly mumble a whimpered plea ‚òîüí®üí¶ ‚Äúahh üòÄ please üò≠üòï  It‚Äôs too much üôÉüòÖü§ß‚Äù

He quickly responds to her touch üî™ my ass muscles tensing involuntarily ü§Øüòõ quickening the whole process üî´üòêü§®

‚ÄúOh baby üçºüë† such a good boy for me üòöüòΩüíã‚Äù

I start to question if she is talking to me or my cock üëÖ  I‚Äôm unable to catch my breathe üôÉüò¨üòÖ feel as though I‚Äôm chasing the present ü•±üî´ just seconds behind all of it üí®  *Oh my god ü•µ Holy fucking hell ü§Æü§¨*

I tilt my head back down and see her focus üß†ü§ì her determination ü•∫üò•üò≠  She is expectant and she looks up from my cock to penetrate my eyes üçÜüëÖ  They travel right to my core and I buckle üò¨ sounds I‚Äôve never heard before üòπüòÖ never made before spew from my lips üî´üëÑ

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it üí®üòÖ  C‚Äômon baby üçº‚Äù  Her strokes quicken around my throbbing cock üçÜ  *I can‚Äôt üö™üî´üòï no üî´üòêüëæ oh god üòØ  Oh fuck ü•µ*

Suddenly her dildo is hitting a spot in me that sends a flight signal to my brain üß†  *Too much üòÑ too much üòÑüòïüòÅ*

But I am rooted on her üôÑüòëüò† I want to be her good boy ü•∫ I beg and plead with myself üêäüç£üåù  The desire consumes me and as she hits that spot each time I fall into her lap üëÖü§≠ her hand tightens just enough around my cock üëÖüòãü§§  My balls tighten once again and I am spewing my second orgasm into her hand and onto her stomach ü•¥üëÖ

I hump and grind on her lap ü•¥üëÖüòÇ dumb and chaotic with euphoria üòê  She is praising me and I am glowing üíÄü§¨üî´ my entire body feeling as though I am asleep and yet never more woke üòê

Time ceases to exist ‚è≥ I ride this wave of ecstasy and it extends üí®üö¨ ebbing and flowing with the beating of our bodies üî´  I slow üòêüòë utterly exhausted and weak ü§Æü§¢ü§ï

I collapse onto her üö™ her dildo flopping from my ass ü•µ

‚ÄúOh my god üò≤üòØü•µ holy üò≤ü•µ holy shit ü§Øü•µ  That was üòÖ‚Äù  I am breathless üí®üöôüöó ‚Äúthat was üí¢üòØüòÄ‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know üôÉüò∂ I just üëæüî´ that was üòê‚Äù  I swallow and try to find words for what just happened üßêü§Øü§î

‚ÄúYou were amazing baby üçº fucking amazing üòç  Such a sexy thing üë£üë† Roll over üë£‚Äù  She pushes me off her and onto my back üö™

She climbs up onto my chest ü•µ the dildo jutting out over my face üëÑ  I‚Äôm still working to recover üö™ ‚ÄúYou need to taste üëÖüòã  There‚Äôs nothing to be sorry about my good boy üôÉ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÖ‚Äù

In my haze I struggle to understand exactly what she means ü•±  I watch her rub her hand over her stomach and then run it between her legs üëÑüëÖ  She then grips the dildo üëÖü§™ lifts it as she lowers her perfection- warm üí® wet üë£üßºüíß and glistening onto my face üëÑüî´

Whatever grip I had remaining or had possibly regained oozed out the tip of my cock as my tongue slid inside her and tasted her delicacy üëÖü§§üçÜ

Her thighs clenching around my head as she grinds into me üëÖ  *Thank you Miss Mae üòòüôè*

**Igg half life is ~27 days.**

**Find the antibody critical threshold induced via natural infection using the half life equation:**

**Realize critical role of antibody levels in vaccine efficacy:**
&gt;**If the antibody levels drop significantly, vaccine efficacy also declines. And if these antibodies disappear completely, the body is left defenseless.** Here's a possibility researchers have been dreading: a vaccine resulting in strong antibody response only for a month or two. That would mean each person would have to be vaccinated several times a year. [[Nasdaq source]](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-is-the-best-news-yet-for-modernas-covid-vaccine-2021-01-17)

There's often a perception that you have to go through hell first as a man. That you've got to prolong suffering in silence before seeking help - because it proves you're not weak.

In the military, I saw a psychiatrist who told me I seemed fine because one of his other patients couldn't talk unless he was standing in the corner looking at the wall. This was apparently where he though the bar should be set. I agreed to ""get better"" just to stop seeing him, and continued my suicidal ideations until I got my shit together. Looking back, that probably wasn't the right decision. But I wasn't going to see my mental health trivialized. 

I was raised according to belief that looking weak (not being weak) was the worst possible thing that happened to men. To an extent, I think many of us are either proficient at hiding our weaknesses, or at least transparent in our attempts to do so.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","Fresh eggs, hot grease, small pan, fry one egg at a time, season after plating.

Heat pan. (I use medium heat.)

Crack egg into a small, short cup. 

Add grease/oil. (I use bacon fat). The pan should be hot enough to see the grease/oil immediately shimmer. 

Tilt the frying pan so the grease gathers in one side, pour egg into grease. 

Pan back flat, let the white cook and get a bit of color in it. Gently tilt the pan side to side to prevent the egg from sticking/prevent hard yolk if you like a soft yolk. 

Tilt the pan so the egg slides away from you. Position your spatula closest to the yolk, and tilt the pan so the egg slides onto the spatula while gently scooting your spatula under the egg. Make sure to get the entire yolk onto the spatula, it's ok if the white hangs off a bit, as long as the yolk is fully on the spatula.

Tilt the pan, flip the egg, flatten the pan. Remember to keep the pan moving if you don't want a hard yolk. 

Plate, salt, pepper. 

It takes me no more than a minute to fry an egg. Probably first 40 seconds on the first side. Last 20 seconds on the flip. Practice makes perfect!",1614556962

Because to get Russell Wilson, you will need to give up substantial draft capital because the Seahawks are giving up $40M in cap space in dead money. They won't settle for one 1st. They will want multiple 1sts to get cheap labor to replace what they've lost in not only their QB but cap space. And this all hinges on Dak likely signing the tag. In order to get him to sign the tag, the Seahawks will need to work out a long term deal with Dak that he actually wants. 

Not only is this plan unworkable, it doesn't fix any of the Cowboys' problems long or short-term. I argue that it actually makes it harder for the Cowboys to contend for a championship.

Therefore unless the Seahawks are willing to basically give up Russ for effectively nothing, I don't want him because the price is too steep.",1614556963

"livesound","t5_2remi","School band director here. Also the school sound/light/concert recording guy in the side.  

Recording large ensemble in this situation is my nightmare. Recording in the band room even worse.  Recording with everyone 6x6 apart worse. Oh and the safety guidance is that they not play for more than 30 minutes at a time before you have to change rooms...more headaches for running a recording session. I've been recording rehearsals all year to figure out placement if I absolutely had to.


The greatest difficulty here is that the sound of a concert band is partially because of its normal seating. They sit relatively close together, in arcs, and that really blends the sounds together in a lovely way.  Students will have a hard time playing this way even with just the six feet of distance between them (both side to side and front to back). Knowing the dimensions you need to record will help you make decisions. If they are 28 ft across and 42 feet deep that's one thing. If they are 42 feet across and 12 feet deep that's another. I'd rather record the former than the latter. 

You may have to make a very important decision. You can either.. .

Speak to the director and say ""is it possible to move kids around for the sake of a good recording? Can we do a couple tests and see what the balance is like in the microphone because it's not necessarily the same as what our ears hear"". 

Or say ""I will record and what we get is what we get just be ready to accept that.""

You'll want to use your SDC up front to get the ensemble.  Be careful not to put them too high or you'll lose the front row I'd say head level of the conductor is good.  Depending on the height of the ceiling, putting them too high will mean and upward firing instruments (tuba, euphonium/baritone, saxophone to so e degree) will dominate the ""ceiling"" sound. I tried putting a mic up high to get a balance and all I got was the euphonium player...that was actually really nice.  Too low and you get a better balance, though it may be flute/clarinet heavy. 

Recording percussion has two options. Mic every percussion instrument or don't mic the section at all.  I wouldn't do any in-between. The sound will cut through most likely. 



I would use the LDC to reinforce half way through the ensemble depth wise (unless you need more mics width wise).  

The dynamics can be used as solo mics but depending on the instrument may not be necessary. 

But honestly I've found that more mics never solved the problems better than telling the ensemble to play better did.  The four condensers across the ensemble is the best sound I've gotten.

You can also ask the director how good the kids are at balancing for important parts while playing. 

I wouldn't worry too much about getting a stereo balance. The fact that they are sitting so far apart from each other will do that. 

Band rooms were not made for recording. They soemtimes have noisy vents.   Bells ding and intercoms chime. You're going to run into mic placement, echo, and other issues. Getting a great recording like this will be so much effort, which is why I'm taking the ""I'll get what I get. I won't lose the quiet instruments but it won't have the concert band sound"" approach.  If we were outside or in the auditorium I'd have better chances than in the band room.",1614556964

Today's LP could be alil better I for one did vote for Jorgensen but um can only get so far when a big name in the LP is ""Vermin Supreme"", he wears a rain boot on his head and has a wizard's beard so what no one really takes the LP seriously, and also because the gov usually doesn't let LP candidates debate either so we never get any exposure, Jorgensen was on every ballot and she had to set up her own interviews,  but I think we're growing a lot. I think I can see the young like Gen Z are waking up to the left vs right bs so in my opinion the LP is only going to grow stronger over time, who knows maybe 2024 will be our year.

Those characters that had the chance to reveal her had some weird ulterior motives like the other dude who didn't expose her in exchange of being his girlfriend. The other girl too who's a ncerophiliac. She also had a chance to reveal Nana but since Nana found out about her true identity, she couldn't.

 I think Gyms should be back relatively soon but not before those things. Putting them at step 2 or 12th April seems about right to me.   


My point was more about the difference between essential exercise and not. Yes it's exercise is essential, which is why even in the strictest lockdown we've ever done it's always been allowed to go exercise however you can't use that to say that when it's literally illegal to stand and chat to someone outside your household that gyms should be open, you don't NEED a gym to exercise.",1614556966

I agree with you that griddy was meant for ppl who actually controlled their electricity, not ppl who just ignore it. Griddy sent out emails every day and called twice going in to the storm telling ppl that if they werent the best griddy savers, they should switch companies. My bill this month was 500$ (usually 100), so i lost a lot, but my savings for the year are significantly higher. These ppl with 9k+ bills were absolutely doing griddy wrong, and they probably should have never been on griddy in the first place).

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","I think the Machines, while not a hive mind, like to pretend they are nothing more than logical automations without emotions or personality. We know this is false, that there are at least some subset that develop personalities, philosophies, and unique idiosyncrasies. Some of them embrace this side to themselves, others try to hide or ignore it. In the first Matrix Agent Smith sends out the other agents when he is trying to break Morpheus' mind. He takes off his earpiece and monologues about how he HATES humans and DESIRES freedom from their stench. He seems to try to hide this side of himself from the other agents. In the sequels he turns away from the Machine collectivism and embraces individualism, displaying a sense of humor and hubris. We also see other machines embrace their more individual selves, rogues and emigrants from the Machine City (Oracle, The Merovingian, Sati). The Machines seem to want to pass these off as aberrations, but I'm inclined to believe they all have unique personalities that they are suppressing. 

In any case, the Machines don't have much of a culture or society, as it's actively suppressed. The Machines that do have the capacity to develop a culture either get terminated, ejected, or flee. That said there appears to be machine counter-cultures, much like the humans that make up the potential red-pills, that exist in the Matrix. One such subculture is the underworld that the Merovingian keeps charge of.",1614556969

Did his best to deliver on his promise to build a wall despite having no support from the House

Signed multiple peace deals in the middle east

Placed tariffs on Chinese goods to force Chinese to the negotiation table

Operation Warp speed

Put pressure on NATO countries to pay up to their obligations of the treaty

Renegotiated nafta, Usmca

stopped apologizing for America abroad, ahem,  Obama

Killed Solemoni

Pulled troops out if the middle east as soon as he could, of course a number still remain. Advocated a foreign policy of America First which meant we would get out of entangling wara in the mid east that dont serve our interests.

Violence = bad.
Dictatorship = can only arise through violence, and maintains itself through violence.
Therefore, dictatorship = bad.

OP was very mature and fair and TRIED to discuss it with him. He's the one that refused a compromise, refused to listen, and threatened her with naming the baby while she was too sick to stop him. Which is extremely fucked up of him. I'm not sure I'd even want to stay with someone that threatened that. It's cruel on a whole other level.

When one person is bad at listening and doesn't want to hear it, the other partner isn't necessarily a bad communicator. You can be the best communicator in the world sometimes... and it can end up making zero difference.

But really. Tons of people come to places like this because they tried to talk already, and their partner/parent/friend wouldn't listen. So they feel stuck. That's really common on the relationship subreddits. ""I have this issue with my partner, **and I already tried to talk to them about it**, but they didn't listen and now I don't know what to do.

This is another factor why the partnership/alliance between Israel and some Gulf states reveals more weakness than strength. The US is increasingly losing its mojo, and the Biden administration is already prioritizing its great power struggle with China over the Middle East. The loss of America's security umbrella for the Gulf states can not be filled with closer cooperation with Israel.

An LLC can be a very powerful tool to limit yourself from other people‚Äôs negligence, but if you‚Äôve got no employees and are doing everything yourself? Now an LLC doesn‚Äôt protect you. This is because an LLC doesn‚Äôt limit your liability if you are being sued for your own personal actions/inactions, or you have a business liability you signed of guaranteed personally.

So I‚Äôll need more facts to determine whether it makes sense for you to keep all homes in separate LLCS. If you have employees and property managers, it makes more sense. If you self manage, an LLC won‚Äôt help you much for limiting liability.",1614556970

For amenities, as you get late into the game more cities tends to not really hurt you much. Earlier on, luxuries will be the main thing solving amenities and that sort of soft caps how many amenities you have at once across your empire. But later on things like Zoos and Stadiums give a ton of amenities to cities in range, along with policy cards, Ski Resorts and so on. And quite a lot of these amenity sources, well adding one more city just means one more place these amenities get added for free (e.g. build a city in range of a Stadium and it's got 4 amenities immediately - 1 from Zoo and 3 from Stadium).

"LockdownSkepticism","t5_2iokxd","As I said, I imagine bars/clubs and restaurants who don't want to deal with takeaway orders on a mass scale might be closed but they also get access to funding throughout the week. I also suspect close contact luxuries like beauty salons would have to close as well but even with those numbers, it is a vast minority.

Meanwhile, retail stores are fully operational, as are fast food outlets, cafes, corporate offices (albeit working from home) are all open.

Not at all, but people are far more prepared the country, as a whole, has contingencies for these events in the event of restrictions. As I said, we aren't arrogant or selfish.

I never said we were like the US, I'm trying to get it through your head how the Law of Averages works but, try as I might, you can't seem to comprehend one of **the** most basic statistical principles in the world. It doesn't matter what I see, you just don't get how averages work at all.

You're blaming circumstance for a terrible situation instead of the person committing the crime. The same way people victim blame sexual assault victims. 

None of this matters. For one thing, you're speaking from an outside perspective. You've proven that you have no clue of what's actually going on in our country due to your consistent holes in information that I've had to correct. You think you're some kind of expert who can predict the future. And you also can't seem to grasp the concept of a country working together to protect their community... Because apparently that's not a thing in most of the rest of the world. Instead, you resort to conjecture, twisting statistics to suit your narrative, and judging a situation that you can't even see for yourself. You seem to think that 31 days of a lockdown followed by 32 sporadic days of restrictions in a single city amount to some sort of tyranny.

Not to mention your entire reddit account seems to be dedicated to the tin foil hat that is ""Lockdown Scepticism"", that basis of most of which seems to be ""wE dIdN'T dO iT fOr OtHeR iLlNeSsEs So WhY tHiS oNe?""

All of this is in spite of the fact that our cases and deaths per capita are among the lowest in the world despite the massive spike we received just before our first big lockdown. Not to mention the swift recovery across the country for not only Government spending but our business and economy. We minimised health risks **and** any subsequent consequences to our economy but people still bitch about it. We stopped as much of our loved ones dying as much as we could but most of the answers to that are just a general acceptance of death; collateral damage. Other countries have been struggling with this since it's beginning and New Zealand is one of a few countries who is absolutely fine and will be even more so when the vaccine is rolled out publicly.

But because this doesn't satisfy the denialists, they have to pick a part non-existent points based on conjecture and hindsight. Become a politician and run the country; easiest fix.",1614556972

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","Nothing is more annoying to me that someone saying that they didn‚Äôt get my texts / bad service or they couldn‚Äôt answer because of the service. Or that their phone died or was off. Not because I‚Äôm being blown off. But because it‚Äôs so stupid! If you‚Äôre going to lie, at least put some thought into it.

If you iMessage someone and have your ‚Äúsend as SMS‚Äù on, and the message cannot reach the phone you‚Äôre sending It to, then u see the blue bar at the top lag, for awhile. Then, it will swap to green. The same is true if the person has no service.

If the person is out of service it will stay blue, but not say delivered. If they continue to be out of service, then it will go thru as sms (if you have ‚Äúsend as sms‚Äù on) and turn green. 

If it continues to be out of service for long enough you‚Äôll get the ‚Äúcannot deliver‚Äù/red check mark thing.

If it‚Äôs a service issue and you call them, it will beep 3x and disconnect and say ‚Äúcall failed‚Äù. 

If you call a second time, it won‚Äôt ring and will go straight to vm.

If the phone is off/dead and you call, it will ring 1.5x and go to vm. If you call back a second time, It will go straight to vm.

With messages, if their phone is off or dead, it will never ever say ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù under a text. 

‚ÄúDelivered‚Äù means = the phone receiving this message has physically obtained the message. It is currently on that phone. 

If they say they didn‚Äôt get it and it says delivered on your phone, they‚Äôre lying. 

With the imessaging, that‚Äôs super cut and dry: you will never see the word ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù under your message - there are no exceptions to this - if the phone is out of service or the battery is dead or if the phone is off. Unless it‚Äôs a service issue, where it sends it thru as a text... if the phone is dead or turned off, it will stay blue. But will never say ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù until the phone is turned back on and the message is received by the device and available to be read.

It feels so different and I feel fulfilled with my life. I'm one of the lucky ones and I dont mean to sound distasteful with that!
My point ultimately is that you're right, it is different. Massively so. And while you're okay with being a stepmum you're not okay not being a mum. 
Do you want a career? Or does he want a career woman? Because while you may ne happy with him as a person you need to be happy with your life overall. There may be some tough decisions and conversations ahead... 
Maybe try phrasing it as it's not that they are not enough but this life is not what you dreamed of. Try not mentioning the stepkids when talking about wanting to be a mum. If he brings them up remind him that they are older and have a different relationship with you, not that they're not yours. 
Having the love of your life isnt enough, life isn't a romantic comedy so you need more. You need to not resent that love for stopping your dreams and wants and needs..

In the shot of them holding hands, they're inside their home, for one, and Vision's wearing normal clothes, and right now I don't think he has time to dress himself or go out in his human disguise again. Why would he?

Also because this scene is at night, and the day/night cycle is completely different inside the Hex than it is outside. I don't think that there'll be enough time for it to become nightime inside the Hex again before the final battle happens, especially because they're showing us Wanda and Vision fighting during the day (see the ""This is our home, let's fight for it"" scene), and she's wearing her clothes from ep. 7/8 in that very scene, but she's not wearing those same clothes in that clip of them holding hands.",1614556974

There were little solar panels on the backs of its ears, and when it got dark it would switch on the eyes, which were LEDs behind little spinning domes that would shine little points around like disco balls. It lasted surprisingly long into each night, typically dying a little after three in the morning. From its perch atop our canopy it was visible from a long ways off as a twinkling point. Our neighbors in GA told us that it helped them find their way back at the end of each night. We named him Lenny.",1614556976
"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","My thought on that is based on Marvel's original philosophy: all characters should not be perfect.  So it's the whole DC gods who try to be men and Marvel's men who try to be gods or whatnot.   So for every super science guy Marvel had, they always had a major flaw.  Batman had no flaws.  So like Reed was a great scientist, but it often affected his relationships.  So, in Marvel's world, how do you have 'the world's greatest detective' without making him a god like Batman?  What fallibility do you give to a guy that can figure out all the answers?  And if you can figure out a weakness to give him, does it make for a compelling story or character?  My guess is that they couldn't.    

Marvel has PIs, but none of them are the world's greatest: Jessica Drew, Jessica Jones, Jamie Madrox, Dakota North, etc",1614556976

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","I, unfortunately, started having to explain it to people like the flu and pneumonia. I basically had to start telling people that when you have the flu, you don't JUST have a fever. You may be throwing up, you may have body aches. You may be sweating, with chills, and a fever, and no appetite. You may have a severe cough and cough shit up. You have multiple symptoms and issues going on. And if your body isn't able to fight it off, it can develop into something even worse (aka pneumonia). It takes its toll on your body. 

Many people don't realize that an illness or disease isn't just one symptom, it's a whole group of them taxing your body. Many of which can often play into others or sometimes turn into whole new problems. It's obviously not the greatest analogy, but it seems to work pretty well for most people I've talked to and none of them have later gotten overwhelmed when I've laid on them just how much I have going on, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, not everyone is the same, and not everyone has their health issues always interconnected. But oftentimes it is tied together (just for an example, anxiety/depression can be tied to heightened levels of pain, and pain, in turn, can cause pain, scoliosis can cause pain, which in turn causes anxiety, which causes high blood pressure, which leads to heart disease, stroke risks, etc etc etc.)",1614556977

Like, if you want sand vs gravel, plants or not, lots of wood or rock, etc. Getting the tank the way you want it to look will also make some fish better choices than others, to some degree. Lots of swim space or the need for many hides, fast flow or almost still, a substrate suitable for burrowing or something difficult to disturb, those kinds of things.

You've mentioned several different tank sizes, even starting two separate tanks, and many different aqadvisor stock lists. It seems you are allowing changes to all variables instead of settling in on some to reduce the number of choices you have to make. Tanks size, salt vs fresh, planted or not, blackwater, high flow river biotope - I'd suggest starting with a final general concept and that will make it easier to pick your fish.",1614556978

"ndp","t5_2qm8o","Right. They could just set minimums things that must be covered, and it's up to the provinces to implement them as they see fit. Just like with the Canada health act currently.

The Quebec plan is public-private, isn't it? So not a universal public pharmacare like is currently being proposed. My understanding is employers are required to offer it if they offer any health benefits, and everyone else is required to contribute to an insurance style plan. I believe this is why they haven't seen cost savings from their program.

I think the criteria in the Canada health act, such as public administration, are vital.

So you are seeing some people advocate for a federally run pharmacare program? I've only seen people want it as an extension to the health act, since that's the simplest route.

Of course even that is not so simple. The provinces agreed to the health act because the feds were supposed to pay for most of it, but the feds have cut funding for it significantly, leaving the burden on the provinces. They will be reluctant to trust that the same wouldn't happen again.",1614556978

"Oxygennotincluded","t5_3f1fv","Really; you only need to cool certain parts of your map. For instance, your SPOM's, and your farms. 

Concentrate your cooling where it -needs- to be. For instance, if you make oxygen that is say, 1C; then begin to pump it out to your base. It will over time cool your base. Since you will be pumping oxygen anyways; it's a win win. You can put your oxygen production right by your aquatuner setup; and just pump cold oxygen. When you move on to a closed base with dupes in atmosuits instead; it's even easier. 

All your industrial equipment and batteries will probably eventually be in a isolated area, insulated; and thermally regulated by whatever means you decide (Hot steam Industrial bricks are the easiest imo). And you won't have anything producing heat anywhere that will be an issue. 

When you start getting space materials; you can start making liquid or even solid oxygen. Dump a little solid oxygen in to your base and let it offgas; and things will chill down quickly. You can thermally regulate your entire base with a nice short cooling loop.",1614556979

"StratteraRx","t5_3bfwn","Strattera at high doses can trigger anxiety and irritability, but is not dangerous and totally safe. However at optimal doses it actually has an anti-anxiety effect in ADHD persons, and also acts similarly as an anti-depressant. 

While pharma recommends starting the titration from 40mg for at least 3 days and go up to the optimal dose (clinical trials show that optimal dose to have effects is between 80mg-100mg, whereas most people I know take doses between 40mg to 100mg). I would advise you to discuss it with your Doctor to lower the dose to 25mg or 18mg for a week, and slowly increment: 1 week in 18mg, 1 week in 25mg, 2 weeks in 40mg, and so on...try also to divide the dose bi-daily (morning and night) instead in one take, and take with with food (proteins) to decrease abdominal upset. 

Also, remember you won't see any effects before several weeks (depends on the person), and significant improvement will not happen before 8-12 weeks. For some persons, they have reached the optimal effect and efficacy at around 20-24 weeks. So give it time to act, and don't judge it until you've reached 12 weeks time minimum.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; All this confusion would stall western intervention and compromise Taiwan's defence by attacking within.

Cyberwarfare alone wouldn't stop someone from picking up a phone or radio and calling the US to park a carrier group in the strait. It might slow ground forces in Taiwan for hours or days, but the reality of cyberwarfare is that it's really not great for disruption, but much better for intelligence gathering. Traditional warfare is much better for disruption, and you'd still need a lot of it to try to blackout Taiwan from immediately calling for help (e.g. you'd need to virtually simultaneously jam several radio bands including terrestrial and satellite frequencies, cut dozens of undersea fiber optic cables and brick telephone exchanges; you'd basically need to be the United States Navy and Marines.) And when they randomly go dark for a day or two and the outside world attempts to contact them, the US would move to intervene all on its own.

Shutting down Iran's nuclear enrichment program via malware was an aberration. It was exactly the right kind of thing that can be shut down by hackers; a delicate industrial process that's easily broken by a slight misprogramming of a single kind of device. Power plants aren't that - they're big, dumb, safe assets, and when their computer stops working right the manual failsafes take over and some human being goes and turns a crank somewhere instead of it being computer controlled. Most of the computers in those power plants are there for process monitoring more than anything else; boiler power plants of all kinds have overpressure burst disks and automatic shutdowns that have nothing in the loop that stop them from preventing self harm. Within a day or two, they've ordered replacement parts, installed them, and learned their lesson about connecting their plants to the internet.

Taiwan's industry is *vastly* a better attack surface - plenty of delicate high tech industries that can be disrupted by hacking... but none of them crucial to the defense of Taiwan. Water plants are easier to attack - they actually have chemicals that need to be mixed in proper ratios to make the water safe, and if you messed with those you could do real damage to pipes and make people sick... but again, nothing stopping someone from picking up a phone, and doesn't disrupt their abilities to conduct war or self defense, just spoils their industry.

You know what really disables critical infrastructure like power for ages and stops a human from being able to just walk over and turn a crank or replace a burst disk? A cruise missile. Vastly simpler form of warfare, all told. And if you're going to go through the trouble of that, why bother hacking in the first place.",1614556979

* An official method could be used to look at the gear and act as a sort of Arreat Summit, to check the stats/properties of something you found in the past

* Not everyone has a spreadsheet-viewing program installed

Further, white culture is ""mainstream"" and represented every where a white student chooses to go or where they get accepted. The same can not be said for PoCs. 

So to answer your original question, no, it is not the same.",1614556981

"politics","t5_2cneq","First off, minimum wage has lagged behind inflation for fifty years. An increase now is a correction so inflation shouldn't be too bad outside of some very specific markets. Look up the study by Card and Krueger or any of the confirmatory studies that replicated their conditions. Raising the minimum wage never resulted in job loss, in several cases there was actually a net gain of jobs. The data just doesn't support the idea that a reasonable increase in minimum wage kills jobs. But a lack of demand caused by poverty wages certainly does. Think about it, in a consumer economy we need people to have enough money to consume. Right now, large swaths of the population essentially can't afford anything outside of rent and ramen. If we increase the minimum wage we increase the buying power of those people, which is good for the economy. Now, if we increased the minimum wage to 40 an hour, maybe we would see a net job loss. But the economy supported the equivalent of 23 an hour (based on productivity) successfully in the past, and out economy is better now than it was then.

Second, progressives have plans for all of the issues you listed, and their plans are very popular with the american people as long as you don't tell them who came up with them, immigration notwithstanding. But no group's plans pull a majority approval with immigration other than a broad approval that dreamers should get citizenship, so that isn't an issue with progressives.

And third, I live in one of those low cost states. My labor is worth just as much as someone in Californias. Just because I live in Oklahoma doesn't mean I'm any worse at operating the fryer. Furthermore, setting the minimum wage at the state level would result in a race to the bottom with the firms with the worst pay and benefits fleeing to already impoverished states. That's not good for anyone. You already see this now in Oklahoma with firms relocating here for cheap labor. The result is a bunch of shit jobs without benefits that trap people in poverty. And then people always say ""Well if you don't like it, move."" But that is the real hell of it, workers in poor states like my own or West Virginia literally can't afford to relocate to better states. Without a federal base line we would be setting the stage for what would essentially be third world states. And as someone who lives in one of those states, I would prefer to avoid that.",1614556981

Secondly,  start going to a junior college and take classes that transfer to major universities.  The counselors at the Junior college should be able to help you with this.  The cost for those credits will be much less and while you are there it gives you more time to figure out what you want to do. That will usually dictate where you want to go to school. 

There are also trade schools &amp; programs. For example, auto mechanics, welders, medical technicians, long distance truck drivers.... etc. 

One thing I would consider is getting your passport and try getting  a job on a cruise ship as a waiter or something.  People who do those jobs, travel the world and save their cash because they're stuck at work on a boat the whole time and have no place to really spend it. 

Then there is also the military.   Join the Navy, Air Force, Army, Marines, Coast Guard etc.   This will also help you pay for any schooling you want and you will get all the benefits, make lifelong friendships etc...

The point is don't get too worried or too down on yourself.  It is very good that you are thinking towards this. But I understand how daunting and scary it feels and sounds. 

But it sounds a lot scarier than it actually is.  And as far as student loans, you have the rest of your life to pay those back. Relax! Things are going to work out.  You'll be fine.

"asushin","t5_2aw60p","I agree with you that Shinji in the anime was very altruistic for acceptance reasons and there‚Äôs no doubt that was his reason for piloting the Eva and people pleasing in the first place. However I do, in my honest opinion, think that the fandom kind of writes off Shinji as only doing things for acceptance and acceptance only kind of discredits the fact that deep down Shinji actually is a good person and didn‚Äôt always do things for acceptance in the anime. For example, the way I interpreted the first episode when he finally got in the robot was because he saw how injured Rei was and couldn‚Äôt fathom her getting in the robot so he gave in and said he‚Äôll do it instead for her sake. Him jumping into an active volcano to save Asuka with no protection at all always conveniently gets left out when people point out how wimpy and selfish Shinji is when he does care about Asuka. Hell after saving her for all we know she never so much as thanked him for that nor did he ever bring it up or hold that against her after the fact. Every single time he ‚Äúran away‚Äù, he never actually went through with it and he always came back in the end not for praise or approval, but to protect/save those closest to him and the world at large even leading into EOE. Not to mention he does all the cooking and cleaning no questions asked without so much as a thank you or an appreciation on Misato or Asuka‚Äôs end. If he viewed that as transactional I think he would have stopped that all together but he didn‚Äôt, he kept that house in order despite slowly being dealt impossible circumstances and going insane. Yes he was a people pleaser and did things for people‚Äôs approval, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that he ONLY did it for people‚Äôs approval and deep down he is a good person who truly cares about those closest to him, he‚Äôs just damaged and scarred just like the other characters in the show. But that‚Äôs just my opinion in the end and I‚Äôm guessing that I might be preaching to the choir here. My rant is over, sorry if I didn‚Äôt articulate what I was trying to say well enough, I have trouble putting my jumbled thoughts into writing sometimes, especially in regard to my opinions of NGE.",1614556983

"Stormlight_Archive","t5_2sq9v","Since you asked: 

&gt;!Lashing: he can use Stormlight to change the direction of gravity for himself or things he touches, partially or fully. E.g. so if he wants to walk on a wall, he ""lashes"" himself sideways (e.g. makes gravity go sideways for him). If he wants to collapse a balcony, he doubles or triples up its gravity, still pointing down, so that it collapses. If he wants to just fly, he changes gravity for himself so that he just falls in whichever direction he wants to go. !&lt;

&gt;!He can also use Adhesion to make something sticky by infusing it with Stormlight, like causing a weapon or someone's feet to stick to the ground.!&lt;

&gt;!All of these things are powered by Stormlight. !&lt;

However, you're not expected to have a detailed understanding of all the things he's doing yet. If you keep reading, many of these things (like, what is stormlight...) will become more explained over time. Question for you - why are you asking here, rather than continuing to read and waiting for the book to explain more when it's relevant? Right now, all that you're expected to get is ""Szeth has a sword and magic powers, he can walk on walls and stuff"". Over the course of the books you'll get more familiarity with the magic system and will eventually have a good understanding of what's going on here, but that takes time, you really don't need to rush to Reddit to get out-of-character explanations each time you encounter something you don't understand yet!",1614556983

I see. You're saying the _intent_ and not the _form_ dictates whether something is advertising or not. If I understand correctly, you're saying if she intended for it to draw people to her OF, then it's advertising. But, to be fair, I think we can agree that neither of us know _why_ she posted it, and can't assume.

I don't see it that way; I think there _is_ a lot of low-quality content on Reddit that I would consider clickbait/advertising, and this doesn't fit that mold for me. It's quality cosplay. Looking at this post in isolation, nothing about it says ""come pay for my onlyfans"". You have to decide to go click on her profile to find that.

My doc wants me to take 200mg a week and 1mg of AI a week. I plan to just split my dosage into two 100mg shots a week and no AI until I need it. There‚Äôs a good video on this sub somewhere about the half life of AI and how you should just track your progress in two week chunks.

"Eldar","t5_2ug1c","So I would be careful to add to much to units, due to them also possibly getting buffs AND point increases in teh codex.  A small buff to units that under perform can be ok long as they are written down and agreed by all players.  Id go through every codex people play and try to get them to agree on buffs that at least seem thematic.  You want to remember exarch powers as well, so you can change a minimum if possible.  Also look out for broken combos.

 Dire Avengers:  This seems ok specially since these are still 11 pts.

 Howling Banshees: So, we get an idea of what Incubi are changing too, similar change to banshees (+1 attack base).  They already got +1s due to change to power weapons.  The banshee mask does need a rework, i like the ability someone listed above, with the not being able to fall back from them without a roll.  Or you could give them +1 attack on charge.

Striking  Scorpions: So, these need at least 1 attack added base, like i suggest banshees get.  All our melee aspects need +1 attack.  I dont like adding a crazy amount of new things, but we do need some aspect specific stratagems, i just dont think adding them as house rules is a good idea.  I suggest keeping the current scorpion masks, doubling these guys consolidation move and letting them consolidate in any direction.  Keeping in mind if you change the masks, you have to change at least one set of exarch powers.

Fire Dragons: Change these so they get the better melta damage at short range like marines got.  Not sure they need any other changes, i dislike the idea of adding a fall back after shooting, that should be the fire and fade stratagem.  You could add a reroll on wounding vs monsters and vehicles though.  They do npt have much special in the rules other then having melta weapons, i d wait on the codex to see how they are going to be changed as gw might give them a new ability like  eradicators have, since they stole our gimmick.

Swooping hawks: So....I would look at the birdmen from the adeptus mechanicus and match them to swooping hawks.  With the exarch powers that should make them ok.

Shadow Spectres: I like the thought here, but what i would do is agree on some other exarch powers, as are these not the only ones who didnt get multiple new powers from psychic awakening?  Then you get a strat to add an additional power for 1 cp, or a strat to just replace the power with one of the new ones.  Your ghostlight power there is bad btw, i would never use it.  I like the way your thinking, maybe allow the fire prism strat to also affect these guys (but you shouldnt allow it to affect both types at the same time, either link fire fire prisms or multiple squads of these guys, not both).

 Warp Spiders: I might actually change these guns somehow.  They are currently garbage.  Also let the exarch take power blades for free, otherwise no one will ever take them.  Right now the only reason someone takes these is for secondaries with the re deep strike power.  If they had better guns that might make them worth using.  They are really fast so range isnt the issue, its that they require you to rend in order to get any AP.

Shining Spears: See, even with a 2++ these guys arent broken, as they have short range and do not get invul saves in melee.  Making it fairly easy to catch them in melee even if they fire and fade away.  I agree they do not need a buff however.

Dark Reapers: So dark reapers have one big weaken.  They are squishy.  They cost a lot of pts per model, and its one of the few units you might take in a larger squad.  Giving them a fire and fade ability would break them.  As they are now and with the fire and fade change i expect to see either a squad of these or fire dragons to become more common.  Im not sure they need a change.",1614556985

It makes the roleplay that much more interesting than Hermitcraft roleplay (which I love). It could have been used to cycle new players in and out so the world and various stories were the stars rather than select players.

Even having a ghost-state allowed the players to remain in the world if they wanted to instead of completely leaving the server in an ""afterlife"" server without canonical rules. But because a few players drawn in the audience (Tommy, Techno, and Ranboo for example) when these players ""die"" then the audience will go with them. So there has to be a way to keep them by defying the final death by either allowing resurrection or not accepting in-game death. That is when the canonical lives start becoming irrelevant because they can't just leave or stop affecting the server as ghosts.",1614556985

"ConanTheBarbarian","t5_37vft","Thanks; I'll have to do that. I'm working my way through a lot of Howard's fiction now, so it should fit right in.

I do wonder whether there are any authors who *could* have continued the REH legacy, as you put it so well above. I can't think of many sword and sorcery fantasists from that period who weren't thrown at the problem at one point or another...Wagner, Anderson, and de Camp were some of the better people available in their respective times. (Jordan too, I suppose.) Moorcock had the technical skill, but I don't know whether he could have gotten into the spirit of the thing, and anyway, he went his own way with Elric. I hear the 60s/70s ""Clonans"" like Brak weren't overly impressive either, so no help from that cohort of writers...

I did see the Smith/Tierney team that worked on the Red Sonja books mentioned once as people who might have pulled it off. Can't speak to the issue much beyond that, but Smith did write a literary biography of Howard later, so at least he would have respected the source material, and probably understood it quite well. In the earlier days, Kuttner and CL Moore collaborating, maybe...?

I dunno. It seems like the dream of a good Conan imitation might not be possible. At least judging from the people who tried and failed, some of whom came from the golden age of pulp S&amp;S. Wagner seems like he had the best shot -- a weird fiction / horror writer who already had a well regarded S&amp;S series, and even had the unhappy streak that de Camp believed was necessary to write at Howard's level. On paper, Wagner should have been able to do it. And if he failed, as you say...I do wonder who would be left to try.",1614556985

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","Yeah absolutely agree 100%. Roleplaying is such a big part of RPG's for obvious reasons and Origins is special when it comes to this in that you can have a completely unique experience if you choose a different race and sex.

For example i ALWAYS played human male warrior no matter what and for the first time recently did female mage and was often left amazed at how much the dialogue changes between conversations even with companions. Roleplaying and worldbuilding at this level is seriously a farcry in modern RPG's because having a silent protagonist just allows a writing team to be so much more intricate in its interactions.

At the risk of pissing people off this is why its not really the series itself that i love, when Dragon age 4 came in to the news recently about MP it didn't immediately get me excited to play it but rather to go back to Origins which is exactly what i did. Feel like we have kinda lost too much of what made it special moving forward because of a desire to appeal to as many people as possible with a design shift towards action RPG and additions like the voiced dialogue wheel or the tiresome open world. Even a staple like modding has largely been left by the wayside.",1614556986

"hotas","t5_32txt","I have the same issue with having to keep the Devices &amp; printers settings window open for the stick to function properly and not been able to find a way to fix it, and trust me, I've tried! In the end I just put a shortcut on the desktop to it. I've had my X-52 for years and back when I played Falcon BMS on Windows 7 it was no issue so it's either been broken by Windows 10 or broken by Logitech after they bought out Saitek. I doubt the drivers will ever be fixed if they haven't by now. Having said that I do like the X-52 and it's a mild inconvenience tbh. I would update to a new stick but the only one that I would realistically upgrade to is a Warthog and I won't be affording that any time soon, plus it would require me buying pedals too. I'm too much of a filthy casual to be blowing that kind of cash unless A) I win it, or B) I steal it. The jittery rotaries on my throttle give me major anxiety.",1614556987

"television","t5_2qh6e","&gt; They are as essential as the Old Navy employees

If Old Navy were breaking the law and gaslighting, I'd be calling them out too.  Sadly, people you would cheerleading the law breaking and spreading lies about how Old Navy is a branch of the military because of their name.  

&gt; the people in the audience aren‚Äôt being forced to be there, they are paid workers.

Whoosh.  

And no, that's a lie. They're audience members.  The law says there are to be no shows with live audiences. Everyone else has followed the law and been ethical. 


&gt; I don‚Äôt understand 

Clearly, but that's not going to stop you from ranting is it?

&gt; how you are outraged at a small number of workers 

No, you're lying again.

The outrage is that the law is being skirted by rich assholes, worshipped by people willing to gaslight that audience members are somehow not audience members, while every other production has managed to actually follow the law and be ethical.

&gt;  Are you also posting for grocery store employee rights? 

Yes, actually.  Way to shoot your own lie in the foot though.  

&gt; Are you also posting about rewarding nurses with better hazard pay? 

Very much so.  Boy you really are good at destroying your own lies.

&gt; This is such a ridiculously small problem 

500,000 dead Americans is ""a ridiculously small problem""?  A year-plus economic destruction is ""a ridiculously small problem""?

Virus denialism and minimization, check and check

&gt;  that‚Äôs the weird thing,

And I find it weird that you abandon human decency and law and order just for a crappy laugh track. 

&gt;  that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm responding. 

You're responding to regurgitate minimization talking points.  You're calling audience members ""not audience members"". You're an unpaid cheerleader for how NBC corporate is defying the law by using cash payments and brazen gaslight messaging. 

&gt; Imagine if you applied this passion for 30 people in safe working conditions who‚Äôs jobs are to sit with your bubble and watch a show to subjects that actually matter.

Imagine if your entire stance didn't rely on your willingness to push the lie that audience members aren't audience members.  If you take a flame thrower to ethics and truth just so you can feel like part of an NBC corporate supporting tribe, what would you do for something tangible?",1614556987

"CrusaderKings","t5_2tgic","Hmn, only reason I can think of for they becoming independent on succession is that they inherited Kingdom tier titles. From the [wiki](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Laws#Title_Succession) it seems that Scandinavian Elective would only apply to a single title, probably England, while your Realm Succession Law might still be Confederate Partition.

Confederate Partition means that the game will try to split your Realm equally between all your children, since you were a King the game wants to make your children Kings as well. The ""Confederate"" part makes so that if you hold enough counties to create a new title the game will do so in order to make more of your children Kings.

Since Kings can't have King Vassals your children who inhereted a Kingdom would become independent.

Hwicce is the jure part of the Kingdom of Cownwall, so the game might have created those titles on inheritance, no clue about Mercia though xD",1614556988

* Personal information became a commodity for those seeking to monetize.

"xmen","t5_2s4cn","&gt;I'll count Madelyne as extended family thrice removed lol. What makes her your favorite? Are you a fan of the general direction her character took over the years?

A bit by default, TBH, considering that there aren't all that many choices; She's a good character, but there are many I'd prefer if the pool weren't so restricted. But mostly it's that I think her story is really easy to empathize with (The editorial reasons of why all that happened, and the slight contorsions that entailed notwithstanding) and she makes me feel really sorry for her, and yes that has really cemented over the years, in particular her recent Hellions showing, despite feeling like it was abruptly cut short by the tournament and the debatably logical ""Jean has her soul"" from Jordan White. I admit I teared up a little when she was dying and kept asking people to remember her as a real person.

&gt;Do you feel that too many writers keep coming back to Jean and propping her up as the best and greatest Grey psychic to ever psychic at the cost of everyone else?

I think being overly powerful is definitely one of her core problems, because it leads to an inability to both be strong (Of mind, intellect, and will) *and* fit in a team, because she'll either eclipse them all or need an excuse not to (The famed fainting, most of the time, but also having a mental breakdown - the will aspect - or not solving a situation instantly like she should be able to given her feats), but I don't feel like that getting to the bottom of the issue. As I said, the thing that really makes me resent her (As opposed to a plethora of characters, X-Men or otherwise, that I simply can't be bothered to really care about) is that her preeminence often comes at the cost of the story or other characters. And that is indeed often due to her power (I dub those instances Phoenix-Ex-Machina), but also simply the fact she's part of the ""pop culture"" status quo, and specifically in her couple with Scott, so stuff that gets in the way of that tends to not fare well. I'll admit my main point of saltiness is about Emma being dumped in a truly horrible manner before getting her character assassinated, but she's not the only victim. I wish Marvel would just treat her like any other character and let the franchise move on from her overblown importance.

&gt;What characters would you have preferred to take the stage and keep the spotlight on them in a hypothetical scenario where Jean came off the roster permanently?

For starters I don't think Jean should necessarily be taken off the roster permanently (Unless you only mean the main X-Men book's roster, in which case yes, I do feel like this will be a disaster of contortions from Hickman to make it work with her, and it's arguably already started), though I'll admit she's really tough to write and I'd be hard pressed to find anywhere for her to actually fit well. I guess an Extinction Team 2 of sort, made only of mutants that are about on par with her in power, maybe some cosmic thing ?

As to the question, I guess the natural answer, and one I certainly don't disagree with, is Emma, being my favourite character, who does have quite a few traits that arguably make her into a successor of Jean in some ways (Telepath girlfriend of Scott, and you could go as far as including headmistress since Jean was supposed to become that in Morrison's run, though Emma had that title and vocation in her much before Jean). Really I'd just have wanted things to stay the way they were from Morrison's run until AvX. I mean I could even do with less exposure for Emma, she did reach near Cyclops levels of presence.",1614556989

I suppose to combat this you could place the door controllers in the. Honeycomb near each door. Noone is gonna blow walls to get to a controller just so they can bypass a door.  

I'd love to see more stuff like this in the game but I do think you can accomplish most things with creativity.

So... pretty much what you said in that last sentence except they're turning the current lines into it rather than dedicating resources to additional expansions.

There is a bit more, but I only know bits of theory about why that move was a somewhat great way to do it and am in no way qualified to go into the more in-depth analysis

It's your turn to post the next round - please continue the game **in the next 5 minutes**.

A few tips:

* I've DM'd you a link to submit your round with the correct title.
* Make sure your round can't be solved using Reverse-Image-Search (RIS):
    * Google isn't the only RIS engine! Try using a browser extension like Reveye ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keaaclcjhehbbapnphnmpiklalfhelgf), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reveye-ris/)) to check multiple engines at once.
    * If you need to, you can apply a mask to your image to trick RIS. Try our online masking tool [here](https://imagemasker.github.io).
* Once you've got the next round up, let us know how you solved this one!
* Feel free to join us in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/D2t9fN2) to discuss your round and future rounds.

You lost the game 3 minutes in; that's about it.

Now it's taken you 30 minutes to maybe equilize and now you're late game vs PL with a one item Chen and a Drow that has 6k of ""dead items"" - a naked blink that does nothing for her in fights and a bkb that she walks high ground and feeds twice without using (and when she does finally use it it's a waste basically, it keeps her alive while she deals no damage so she can die 12 seconds later). Anytime you can maybe threaten UL pushes W and then your team doesn't do anything because nobody has a bkb

Maybe I'm being overly pessimistic and someone has another point to make but you lost the game 5 minutes in, it's really not worth analyzing any deeper I don't think.

I have a dedicated center and have tweaked the hell out of it to try to mitigate this issue. It helps but you can only do so much.

I have the sub tuned down a bit, because in order to hear dialog, not doing so would literally sake shit off the walls. While that can be fun... when you start worrying, enough is enough.

I used to have rear speakers, never felt like they did enough to merit having them. A good movie is still a good movie, without them. Sure you miss out on the .5s of ambient effects during scenes like the pan around in the matrix when neo dodges is first bullet etc, but that shit feels more like a gimmick than anything. I think quality is far more important than the number of speakers.

On that front you hit diminishing returns incredibly quickly. It is easy to do better than a generic sound bar or TV speakers, and worth it imo. how much better is a $1000 Klipsch than my $200 budget center? not enough to justify the premium imo.

Over time my audio setups have become simpler. It isn't that you cant do better, Its just that I get 80% of the results with a fraction of the cost.

IMO most people dont have a *room* suitable for expensive audio setups, or the ability to actually make use of such a setup.

Its a bit like putting racing slicks on a 10 year old car with a 4 cylinder

Also, headphones win. But the family?! yeah they can sit in an odd spot where the sound-stage falls apart I guess.",1614556993

And the cameras I'm getting have built-in LEDs that can activate on motion, still provide 2 way audio, and have a really loud siren (manually activated, and I think also can be set to go off with motion).

No subscription, everything is saved locally, and it looks like they are constancy updating existing products and adding new ones.

You can also try reinstalling the launcher: On **Windows**, first use the windows uninstall function to uninstall ""Paradox Launcher v2""(if it is there). And then delete the launcher directories:

* C:/users/&lt;UserName&gt;/AppData/Local/Programs/Paradox Interactive/
* C:/users/&lt;UserName&gt;/AppData/Local/Paradox Interactive/
* C:/users/&lt;UserName&gt;/AppData/Roaming/Paradox Interactive/launcher-v2/
* Documents/paradox interactive/.cpatch/
* every directory in Documents/paradox interactive/ that starts with launcher-v2

In **Linux** delete the directories \~/.paradoxlauncher and ""\~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/launcher-v2/"" and the file ""\~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/launcherpath""

In **macOS** delete the directory ""\~/Library/Application Support/Paradox Interactive""

Afterwards you can start the game from steam again to reinstall the launcher.",1614556994

"neopets","t5_2r64t","It can be really intimidating to get into at first! Especially in coin, since that's one of the most heavily RSed shops since it has some of the most valuable items in the game :) If you're just starting out I'd definitely recommend trying some less popular shops first, or in addition to coins. I personally usually have 5 or 6 shops up at once that I rotate through, which keeps me from getting bored and also makes you more likely to see a RS. 

Really the main thing is patience, and I find it sooo important to choose shops you enjoy to avoid burning out. I love the Spooky Food shop for instance, even though it doesn't have as many valuable items as, for instance, Magic. I enjoy looking at all the names and pictures even if nothing rare stocks for a while. I always listen to music or have a show on in the background, or a podcast, that way you can kind of zone out while refreshing until you see a shop stocked. Patience and practice helps a lot with recognizing the items quickly, but there are also chrome extensions etc you can install to highlight rare items, which I find SUPER helpful when learning a new shop. 

Since the main skills are 1. Recognizing the item and 2. Clicking and haggling quick enough to grab it, I'd also really recommend practicing grabbing some of the non-UB items to work on your reflexes - so, stuff that stocks for 5k or 10k mostly. Sometimes you'll take a loss on that stuff, but I feel like it's worth it to practice (and also just to feel like you have something to show for your time even if you don't score anything rare). If you can't afford the potential loss I can send you some funds too!

Feel free to PM if you have questions or want more tips, I love RSing and want more people to do it haha :)",1614556996

Elder ovls are pretty easy to get with pulse core boost @ 99, but the others are either time gated or expensive, which newer people might not have. Zerk aura is available with MoW, but not everyone would want to pop a 5hr CD for slayer.

No its not. I've been to the field plenty of times and you use the same crap you are given as soon as you get to your unit. When we trained with SF they used to laugh their asses off at us because of how trash our equipment was

&gt;And if you think the US has supply issues you should really look into those other ""superpowers.""

Regardless of other superpowers, you're talking about the US in a foreign country. We go to the field 10 miles from where we worked, couldn't get food sent out to us, the gun line didn't even have ammo on hand half the time, run out of fuel, leaks, communications are down, etc. So I could imagine the disaster of being in the dense, lush forest and mountains of Asia
&gt; they weren't advocating for war at all

They're calling for armed intervention by America in Asia, which we all know *will* result in a buffer war with China (just as it did with Vietnam, and Korea), which would eventually escalate into WW3


The US singlehandedly got their asses kicked in Korea, Vietnam, and in the middle east. All 3 of those conflicts were primarily against farmers and locals with small arms. Not to mention the Army doesn't actually train soldiers to fight against uniformed adversaries anymore. All of our training is based on fighting some goat farmer in the desert.

This might get a bit long since I'm trying to cover a lot of what I potentially might have posted along the way, sorry about that.

Overall I think Dunbine did quite great. Once it settled down after the classic Tomino jump start it managed to create a very compelling fantasy-political weave with interesting factional interplay and the tried-and-tested Tomino character archetypes in the power-hungry despots and reluctant heroes with things falling apart in their hands. Byston Well was also a positively fascinating setting, and there was just enough worldbuilding to have the conflicts make sense and the land feeling like there's depth beyond what we're seeing, while leaving a lot to the imagination in the best of ways.

And the bug mechs, god do I love the bug mechs. Exceptionally unique and absolutely set this show apart basically everything else out there, and the carapace-armor and claws made for really intimidating war machines. My favorites are probably the most beetle-like ones, like the [Drumlo](https://i.imgur.com/DLjeqTJ.jpg) (fattie robots have a special place in my heart, I feel like the Rick Dias in particular took after this guy) or the [Dana O'Shee](https://i.imgur.com/gFEtLk0.jpg) (I wanna give another shoutout to [this unnamed hero](https://i.imgur.com/GJCNrR1.jpg) who held that one castle against Drake's forces alone for longer than anyone expected). The Dunbine itself was kind of just okay though, I actually preferred the Billbine, with the more birdlike motif feeling appropriate for a unit that just chews up insects left and right. The late-show recolor improved it even further, even, pushing it more towards ""armored knight"" aesthetically.

I really liked most of the characters too. Shou and Marvel were pretty basic but perfectly fine for this kind of show, Neal and Keen were great though I wish they got more attention especially in the later stages. At least Neal got to be the one to finish off Drake, I was really hoping they would do that while watching the finale and I'm so glad they delivered on that. Was a great bookend for the story. Excellent array of villains too, Drake being the most typical Tomino big bad (serious Degwin Zabi vibes from the very start, though Drake certainly felt more dangerous) but Leeza turning out to be the most heinous of them all. Riml getting brutally executed by her after so much struggling was honestly the hardest-hitting part of the entire show. Cham was amazing too. Not even Tomino had the heart to kill her, and I want to think she found her way back to Byston Well too eventually.

I was a big fan of Garalia as well, especially her dynamic and comparison with Bern, in their similar but distinctly different approaches to honor, pride, and vengeance. I think they killed her off way too soon, I think there was a lot more to do with her. I'd have kept her around to the very end, maybe even include some hints and regret or redemption at some point, would have made Bern's doubling down on his anger even more effective in contrast. Speaking of which, Bern going full Char clone (the first of his kind even, I want to say) actually felt justified with how hard his ego and pride had been battered throughout the show, but they kind didn't really do anything after that with him. Like with half of the Zelana crew and many other Byston Wellians, I was really on board with where his character was going and then they just kinda stopped paying much attention to them once we got to Upper Earth. Can't say I disliked any of them at the end but the unrealized potential really haunts some of them.

Elle probably had the most complete character arc in the show and I might even say she was my favorite. Foizon was arguably the most badass and charismatic hero in Byston Well, and seeing Elle go from a princess being tossed around by the war to [actually living up to her grandpa's legacy](https://i.imgur.com/Ji4zajH.jpg) was lovely to see. And come on, [this was just a brilliant line.](https://i.imgur.com/ThNlj18.jpg) The loyalty of her officers was also really endearing. Her end wasn't as spectacular as it could have been but at least Abe knew how to make their exit grand. Ciela felt a bit overlapping in role but she turned out well enough. Riml I always liked but she was denied so many chances to shine.

As for the story, probably echoing many others here in saying the last arc really did not do the narrative many favors. Ever since the first visit back to Upper Earth I expected the story to return for a more extended arc there, and I was actually very on board for the first few episodes when we did return. The Shou and Marvel stuff was great, as were the really messy political situation and battles it created, and it felt both narratively and thematically appropriate. But it just went nowhere for so long. Back in Byston Well the story did have a lot of seemingly inconsequential battles as well, but you learned something about the world or the characters every time, and now they just stagnated. The show never stopped looking good or having great action setpieces but it's definitely the one big detriment to an otherwise excellent show. It did pull itself back together for the ending at least, and despite feeling pretty crammed I did like the ending a lot. Ever since the second (?) intro narration and the Ferario interactions I was expecting exploration of dead souls and reincarnation in Byston Well so it was good to see the show lean heavily into that at the end. In one form or another, I believe they all made it back to Byston Well, which lightens the heart if just a little bit after all the bloodshed. Very reminiscent of that one other Tomino show I probably don't need to name, though coming at the back of a considerably lighter show overall.

As I said at the start, I think it was a pretty solid show overall, even if the one part dragged it down to a degree. Squarely in the Good Tomino side of things, and I'd probably slot it right after Xabungle and before L-Gaim in my rankings. It's really interesting to see how closely related his 80s productions are in the way the concepts evolved and were iterated on from show to show. Helps that they shared staff to a very large degree and were made basically continuously from 1979 onwards. Also kinda funny to see that Dunbine was not just a seminal isekai work but turned out to be a *reverse isekai* for a considerable part of its runtime as well. Gonna head right into the Dunbine OVAs after this, with Garzey and Rean lined up right after, though I doubt they can deliver anything quite as grand or in-depth as a full TV series. Really hoping Tomino takes another shot at Byston Well anime still, he *did* mention he had a non-mecha project coming up in the future after all...",1614556999

It seems like a handful of idiots who think that rules are ONLY for other people wrecking everything for the rest of us. And themselves. It‚Äôs not like the college is going to give us the week off. Classes schedules will still continue. We just lose the practical bits.

I just hope people aren‚Äôt stupid enough to try and circumvent the rules to go home for reading week. That $750 fine isn‚Äôt such a big deterrent as to make that huge a difference to people relying on the bank of mom &amp; dad, or crb &amp; osap payments.

Edit: It‚Äôs a $5000 fine for not self-isolating. Much better as a deterrent. Thanks for point that out, Moonmilknova!",1614557000

"tlss","t5_3d5ul","I generally agree with your market cap post and you and I discussed it a bit at the time, but I have a hard time fully letting go of the shares outstanding and by extension, market cap, with this chart analysis. Not saying you're wrong by any means, just trying to expand my understanding. 

From my casual observation your TA has been relatively accurate over the past couple months, but at the same time, dilution hasn't happened much over that same time period. Even if we added a half billion shares in the last few months, that's only a 30 or 40% increase. My issue I'm trying to wrap my head around is if we pull TA back a full year we are looking at an almost 600% increase in shares outstanding which now has a significant impact on the charts.

I think I understand where you are coming from on your point about only PPS matters. Agreed that if you bought at the .2699 peak in May/June it doesn't matter to you if the company grew but is sitting at .047 currently because you lost money. However, based on 306M shares then and 1.74B shares now, the market cap is almost exactly the same. In order to get back to a PPS of .2699 the company would have to grow by 5.75x or the valuation multiples would have to grow by 5.75x. 

Both the fundamentals I have dug into as well as your TA seem to be pointing to the same thing, just at very different timeframes. With only a rudimentary understanding of TA, I can't help but think that the massive dilution is skewing the numbers.

I know it is counter to what we were talking about earlier, but I would be really curious to see if similar patterns present themselves on a chart tracking market cap. Do you know where I could find a graph for TLSS for market cap over the last year, or shares outstanding over the last year?",1614557000

The recipe is an adaptation of Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip

Ingredients:

* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened (I used 1 stick cannabutter, 1 stick regular butter)
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

To bake:

* Preheat oven to 350¬∞ F.
* Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl. Beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla extract in large mixer bowl until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually beat in flour mixture. Stir in morsels and nuts. Drop by rounded tablespoon onto ungreased baking sheets.
* Bake for 12-18 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.",1614557000

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Al√≠ Emmanuel Delgado y Patricia Gomes, titulares de la primera c√°tedra contra el racismo en la Facultad de Derecho de la UBA.
&gt;
&gt;Junto a su primo Al√≠ Delgado est√°n al frente de la materia ‚ÄúDerechos de las comunidades negras en Argentina desde una perspectiva afro‚Äù.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hace un tiempo presentaron, entre muchos otros proyectos, el de una c√°tedra para, en el lugar donde se forman abogados y abogadas, combatir el [racismo](https://tn.com.ar/tags/racismo/) estructural.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚ÄúNosotres creemos que la historia se escribi√≥ **prescindiendo de los afrodescendientes** y este discurso, que se fue construyendo desde la famoso negaci√≥n e invisibilizaci√≥n del componente afro en la sociedad argentina a trav√©s del tiempo, fue tomando cuerpo **el mito de que en la Argentina no hay negros**‚Äù, explica Gomes.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúPor eso hablamos de **racismo estructural**, y decimos que se naturalizan **pol√≠ticas que generan exclusiones para nuestras comunidades.** Decir que en la Argentina no existen comunidades negras es **borrar una parte de la sociedad**‚Äù, sostiene la activista afrofeminista y antirracista.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Seg√∫n detalla, hay 47 inscriptos en la materia ‚ÄúDerechos de las comunidades negras en Argentina desde una perspectiva afro‚Äù, que pertenece al departamento de Filosof√≠a de la Facultad de Derecho de la universidad.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúPretendemos abordar un temario muy amplio que comprende los procesos sistem√°ticos de invisibilizaci√≥n, exclusi√≥n y marginaci√≥n de las comunidades afro de la Argentina; dimensiones y consecuencias del racismo en la poblaci√≥n afrodescendiente en Argentina; violencia institucional y an√°lisis de casos de racismo en Argentina‚Äù, detalla Delgado que junto con Gomes tambi√©n forman parte de la organizaci√≥n de afrodescendiente OAFRO que trabaja para acercar el acceso a la justica a la comunidad negra.

Understand,that the reichwing has ALWAYS used projection as a way to telegraph what they themselves are actually doing.
Goebells would be SOOO proud of today's reichwing for perfecting his disinformation technique.

Trust and believe it's not""leftists"" who are the vast majority of""NAMBLA"", or the ones raping children,ala Dennis Hasert, Roy Moore,the Child Sex parties in the WH during Reagan's tenure, it's endless.

Back in the stone age days of the internet,there used to actually be a database that kept track of how many politicians and folks who work for politicians and political parties got busted for pedophilia.
The ratio of Rightwingers to Leftists was literally like 900 to 1.
For every one so called ""leftist"" that got busted,there were literally 900 reichwingers who got busted for it.

It's actually that fkn lopsided.
It's not a bug with them, it's a feature,and they use their religious beliefs to defend it.

So when they say their ""religious freedom"" is being""trampled"", understand that they're pissed because they can no longer rape with impunity, mainly minors.

I guess that makes sense that there really isn't a definitive *optimal* build for any specific monster since there will always be a variation in the player's perspective of *optimal*. I was very observant in the Pokemon scene which is why I asked because a lot of Pokemons would have an *optimal* build regardless of the team, EVs, IVs, Nature, Moves, are usually always the same. Also, whatever is the flavor of the month after nerfs and buffs is a good point. I wasn't aware that the developers uploaded patch notes since I am a new player, also I'm on Switch which is always late when it comes to updates. The points on the team building also make sense, I didn't have that much of an issue playing through the game. Only rarely did I ever swap out my team throughout my playthrough. I keep seeing a lot of only-one-teams that can 5-6 star all of the champion's fights, which makes them redundant after clearing them all once?

I also think Julia's communication and being able to post and reply to updates on Reddit are awesome - they also lowered a lot of barriers for me wanting to get involved. It helped provide explanations, so I hope this is also helpful.

**So how will you help raise this awareness, not only just before elections, but throughout the** ***entire*** **school year?**

I think this is a place we definitely could've improved, raising awareness of the different ways to get involved (ie joining as a student at large on a committee, joining a resource group), raising awareness of the different initiatives.

It's not really a secret, but communication in the AMS is kind of broken. This year, we really tried to create a strategic plan to revamp our comms. If you look at the AMS instagram, we're currently considering a complete revamp of the AMS instagram and social media (and of course, Reddit is part of it.) to create a regular posting schedule, ways to advertise what we're working on, and operationalize communications about university advocacy.

I of course, also Tweet on Twitter (sunygeorgia) to address pressing student issues, and I've tried to engage more on Reddit recently.

**How did you get to where you are today, running for this position? What would you say to first years of they‚Äôre looking to run in the future? What are your future aspirations?**

First off, I want to say that you don't need an elected position to make a difference. Student activists like Climate Justice UBC are a key part of student advocacy at UBC and how we put pressure on the UBC administration. Second of all, you don't need to be an AMS outsider - there's a predominant narrative.

I started as a floor representative my first year in Place Vanier. I really wanted to get a water fountain in Place Vanier commons-block. The residents of PV wanted a water fountain. Years previous, they were told they would not get a water [fountain. So](https://fountain.So) I decided to run for Place Vanier Residence Association President. I was initially going to run for House President to run sick events and build community, because I thought the RAs and house presidents did a great job of building community. Anyway, that's the story of My Greatest Piece of Student Advocacy.

Last year, when COVID hit and everybody dropped out of the VP AUA race, I decided to create a UBC Campus Support Network. There were MAJOR gaps in what was happening at UBC, and there was a hell of a lot of confusion. Should you get a mask / hand sanitizer? Who's bringing groceries to our immunocompromised? I stepped up to coordinate that network so that people could connect and use it as a resource.

My advice to first years, find what *you* are passionate about, and find other people who are passionate about. Do what you love. And don't be afraid to ask questions - there is no   
dumb question. I had NO idea how to run a campaign when I first ran, but I talked to people for advice. You can pick up a ton of tips. Also: do your consultation with students before you run. It helps clarify your platform, hear directly student concerns. Read the Ubyssey too! I did most of my research on existing initiatives there. If you're passionate about a topic, that will carry you far. Passionate about mental health? Get involved with mental health advocacy as a wellness peer / mental health clubs.

His form can just be awkward, probably since he's such a big guy in part.

I'm sure if a big-name, coveted keeper is on the market soon we might have an eye on them. For now though, Mendy's more than just getting the job done.

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","&gt; Paul‚Äôs letter to the Romans is the same in China as it is in Pennsylvania...what do you mean by this?

I mean religions are all different all over the world. Even within the same religion there is vast disagreement. 

There are thousands of denominations of Christianity. There aren't different denominations of science. Evolution vs creationism are two different interpretations of Christianity. This is a bad example though because evolution actually has a basis in reality, and that's why its the same science all over the world. Let's think of another example...

Hell, from my understanding, has multiple meanings. Some Christians believe it is merely being separated from Yahweh. Others believe it is a literal eternal torture in fire and brimstone. In science, we don't have access to hell to investigate, so there are no scientific papers on hell. As far as science is concerned, it nothing but speculation based on some old stories. But to Christians, one of those hells is as real as the screen you're reading now. But there's no agreement on what hell actually is because there is no evidence of if. There is no source of truth, so you all just pick something and insist its true, and nobody can demonstrate that it is.


I hope I explained it well.",1614557003
"ireland","t5_2qhb9","Covid is a cardiovascular disease, it attacks the ventricles. So it attacks anywhere the large amount o ventricles, which most commonly is the lungs as this is first access point of breathing in droplets and they're a fair amount of ventricles in the lungs, it's also the most deadly place to attack as your body attacks the disease and you produce too much white blood cells for the lungs to clear out and you essentially you drown. 

You might have heard at the start of people getting a thing called covid foot, basically the body absorbed the virus and it caused the infection in their foot and the ventricles in their foot essentially died causing some necrosis. Well there are other varieties of this, kidneys, stomach etc. Well the colon and intestines have loads of ventricles, and sure enough if you get inflammation of those areas you will produce diarrhoea. It's not a likely symptom, and two people to produce the exact same symptoms for this disease in the exact same order is unlikely, but it isnt outside the realms of possibility. 

That said, it's far more likely (as someone already said) to be norovirus. Which I have gotten twice, and trust me, having lived through it, it feels like death, no exaggeration. I couldn't move and had to crawl to spray diarrhoea over the toilet and get sick into a sink. The first time I got norovirus it was brought home by a friend and we had 100% infection rate in 4 days in a house of 5.",1614557003

Despite what our ancestors believed, it turns out the interpretations of all words are subjective and so some people noticing words don't align with reality throw up their hands and say we may as well invent words on the fly, while others refuse that premise and commit to believing that the meaning of words is and must be objective and established.

&gt;&gt; # [La localidad de P√©rez Mill√°n tuvo su propia ‚ÄúRebeli√≥n de Atlas‚Äù: La familia Borrell cierra el frigor√≠fico Arrebeef cansada de los hostigamientos sindicales ¬ª Bichos de Campo](https://bichosdecampo.com//579)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ayer la localidad bonaerense de P√©rez Mill√°n, que cuenta con unos 5000 habitantes, fue testigo de su propia versi√≥n de la ‚ÄúRebeli√≥n de Atlas‚Äù, aunque en este caso deber√≠amos decir la ‚ÄúRebeli√≥n de los Borrell‚Äù, la familia propietaria del frigor√≠fico Arrebeef, que decidi√≥ cerrar la empresa luego de que en los √∫ltimos meses un grupo de trabajadores comenzara a obstaculizar el normal funcionamiento de la misma para intentar disputar la representaci√≥n gremial a Luis Alberto P√©rez, delegado del Sindicato de los Trabajadores de la Carne de la Zona Norte de la provincia de Buenos Aires, quien recientemente sufri√≥ un atentado en su domicilio particular por delincuentes a√∫n no identificados.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; El presidente de Arrebeef, Hugo Borrell (74), quien hac√≠a un a√±o que no concurr√≠a a la industria gestionada por sus hijos, ayer se tom√≥ un tranquilizante, se traslad√≥ hacia el frigor√≠fico y pidi√≥ un meg√°fono para anunciar p√∫blicamente, frente a los manifestantes presentes en el lugar, que hab√≠a tomado la decisi√≥n irreversible de cerrar la empresa.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Si Ayn Rand hubiese estado presente en el lugar, seguramente les habr√≠a dicho a los ahora ex trabajadores del frigor√≠fico que no hab√≠a necesidad de llegar a tan dr√°stico desenlace para comprender que ellos necesitan m√°s de la empresa que los propios empresarios.
&gt;
&gt;Ah√≠ se inici√≥ el gran problema; fueron buscando gente, tuvieron m√°s adhesiones (por parte de trabajadores de la empresa), y en la Federaci√≥n les aclararon que ten√≠an que respetar los tiempos del aislamiento obligatorio; entonces siguieron, consiguieron m√°s gente.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì Ya tom√© la decisi√≥n: la salud es lo m√°s importante.
&gt;
&gt;Y no los ve√≠a bien a mis hijos, como para que me tocara un caso de esos, entonces esta ma√±ana (por ayer), en un momento me puse mal, me tom√© un tranquilizante, me fui al frigor√≠fico, despu√©s de un a√±o sin ir, agarr√© el meg√°fono y le inform√© a la gente que cerraba el frigor√≠fico.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Por supuesto, lo vengo conversando hace varios d√≠as con ellos; estoy en una buena posici√≥n econ√≥mica y no tengo necesidad; lo hacemos (seguir trabajando) porque la empresa va a cumplir cien a√±os.
&gt;
&gt;Por supuesto que cuando se toma esta decisi√≥n, se deja en el medio a un mont√≥n de gente muy valiosa, porque si la empresa tuvo el √©xito que tuvo no fue por Hugo Borrell, sino porque tanto los gerentes como los supervisores y mucha gente ha hecho fuerza para que esta empresa est√© posicionada hoy entre las empresas c√°rnicas m√°s importantes de la Argentina.

When Senator Mike Enzi made some comments suggesting that men who cross dressed deserved to get beat up, a lot of people got pissed in part because they wanted to stand up for Sissy and his ability (and others‚Äô) to do what he damn well pleases. It sparked [statewide protest](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/28/526073329/tutu-protests-and-parties-break-out-in-wyoming-over-senators-remark).

I wouldn't start a language until I reach an intermediate level on the previous one cause otherwise I get lost (if you're a multi tasker then you might find it different). You're maybe thinking about whether a teacher/school is needed or not, I believe not, except on the pronunciation &amp; speaking skills, for that you either pay for lessons and look for good teachers or find a native speaker to practice with in your country or online or you travel there :) 

The most difficult and frustrating part on my personal experience was memorising random words, I just keep forgetting them a lot. The best way I believe to learn new vocabulary is by using it in sentences multiple times to allow the brain to create new connections so that it becomes stored in the long term memory. And to allow these phenomenon in the brain to happen your notes or whatever have to be well organised too. 

And since we're talking about Korean &amp; Urdu that don't use the Latin alphabet, please don't be lazy and use Romanisation systems, start with basics and the Urdu abjad/Korean hangul, trust me, it'll really help in next steps as you advance in your learning!

3. Don‚Äôt count rental income for mortgage repayment ability. 

If there‚Äôs an economic collapse and a large amount of tenants can no longer pay their landlord‚Äôs mortgage what do they think will happen?

Here's hoping Choji starts to take after his father more and stops just being the fat kid soon. Choji's dad becoming a giant looked awesome, I kinda wanted to see him take down that huge snake like that

&gt;I can't pin down Gamakichi's accent in the English dub 

New York apparently, I saw it on the wiki when I went hunting for name trivia. (all I got was Gama means toad). Apparently they picked it because his Japanese VA uses a dialect associated with yakuza areas

&gt;While it's been more than a dozen episodes since we watched it, it's still the same day as Naruto's fight with Neji

That's one of those things I was aware of but had never really consciously thought about before

Yeah, we've been in this for a while but the change to the war made it not feel so long. Thinking back on it now it certainly doesn't feel like 50 episodes but it had all the content to justify it for the most part except for a couple of padding moments around the start of the tornament",1614557005

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; Akiba is a huge town. Previously the adventurers didn't need homes because it's a game. What were all those homes empty?

Yes. 

They were definitely empty.

You do understand the nature of Akiba right? 

Akiba is a RUINS.

It is like the city of Rome after the fall of the empire. It was once a nation of potentially millions, with thousands of larger buildings, but that civilization collapsed hundreds, thousands of years ago. This left the majority of the city abandoned and crumbling, and even at the current time, that is true for *most* of the structures in the area. Pre-Apocalypse, only the bare minimum of the city was actually re-inhabited by Landers, the buildings immediately necessary to service the player population with shops and taverns, and there was no point to any larger population being there because the city had no other major industry. 

It was ""the largest *player* town"" in the sense that it contained a lot of player-centric resources like the Guild Hall and high end gear shops, but these are resources that were largely irrelevant to the Landers, so there was no reason for an extreme amount of Landers to be there. Think of it a bit like a major tourist resort in an island where most of the locals could never afford to stay there and the only people who live nearby do so because they work at the resort. 

*Then* the Apocalypse happened and the players needed places to stay, they did not build entirely new city blocks to create this new housing, they just laid claim to the buildings that nobody else had claimed yet. And they also started to build up a useful trade in goods and services that had not existed prior to the Apocalypse, and that made Akiba a more vital trade hub within the Lander economy, so more and more Landers started to flock to the city, and they would also lay claim to already existing, but long abandoned structures, until the city center became much more vibrant. But even after that, there are billions of square feet of ghost town structures within the footprint of the Akiba metroplex. 

That is Akiba. 

&gt;Your point was that Saiguu is the legitimate ruler. I've been insisting that he's not but it doesn't matter if he is or not because that's not where his influence comes from. 

I never held the point that Saiguu was the legitimate ruler. I've only been insisting that he retained the legitimate ability to create nobles, which made them a political inconvenience.  It took you like a dozen posts before you finally understood lol. 

&gt;There were no half crumbling buildings. It was a ocean bank with buildings on the side. 

The ocean shot showed a deteriorated building right in the middle of the frame. Who builds a new building that is half collapsed? Did you never understand that Akiba exists in ruins? 

&gt;There is literally no reason why their ship would be outside the city. There isn't even a place for them to dock. You are once again making leaps in logic.

There would presumably be plenty of deep water ports in the area. I'm not making any argument as to *why* they would set up camp outside the city proper, I'm only presenting the fact that this IS how the show depicted the situation, *whatever* their reasons for doing so. Look, it can only fall into *one* of the following two explanations for the scene as depicted:

A. The scene with them on llama-horses took place in an area that was WELL outside of the city proper, but within the boundaries of the ruins of old-Akiba, and this explains why there is absolutely zero presence of background crowds and signs of current inhabitation in the ruined structures, when the scene would have looked something [more like this](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/log-horizon/images/8/84/Libra_festival.png/revision/latest?cb=20150912135142) if it was anywhere within the city proper, full of modern decoration and people going about their daily business. 

OR

B. The scene does take place somewhere within the populated portions of the city, but the production staff was being lazy and did not want to draw background NPCs, so they *only* drew the characters central to the dialogue that we were meant to be following, in which case there would be no ""cheering crowds to see Eins off,"" whether or not they actually existed in the narrative. 

Pick whichever suits you, it does not matter. 

Honestly at this point I'm satisfied at my victory. Any readers can see your lack of knowledge in the show and the huge leaps in logic you take. I tried my best for you but unfortunately you are a lost cause. But apparently to you anyone who disagrees is an ""edgelord"". Considering we've been at this for a while I'll just have to leave you in your ignorance. I now understand what it's like arguing with a flat earther or anti-vaxer who's so far in their own bubble they can't see reason.",1614557006

"medicine","t5_2qhff","I'm in my twenties, and have no significant health diagnosis. Per CDC data, Americans in my age bracket including those with significant health histories are four times more likely to die in a car accident than of covid in a 365 day period. 

I have worked 70+ hour weeks since the pandemic has began treating covid positive patients in a critical care setting. For several of those months, I was issued improper PPE. I have never had any high correlation symptoms, nor have I ever asymptomaticly tested positive for covid. I now have the proper PPE, and as such fear covid even less. 

There is no journal published evidence whatsoever indicating that vaccinated individuals are unable, or less likely to asymptomaticly transmit covid to others. Any such claims are at best, untested hypothesis.

Having no perceived personal risk of getting covid, nor any verified altruistic basis for getting the vaccine, means I won't be getting it.


Simultaneously, my 80 year old grandparents with cardiac histories are rightfully secluded in their homes. With a 20% mortality rate should they get covid, they need the vaccine as soon as possible. They have tried unsuccessfully to find appointments, and certainly aren't alone. 

Me rushing to be injected with vaccine doses that I don't want at the potentially grave expense of people who both want, and need the doses would be absolutely appalling. As such on a philosophical basis, yes, I would quit a job that mandated that I got a covid vaccine.",1614557006

I‚Äôm well aware of the sins of the kabbalists and talmudists but most of them are just taking what their rabbi tells them as truth and are as brainwashed as anybody else.

What I take issue with is saying the Jews are the seed of Cain. If we take the Bible literally, all of Cain‚Äôs descendants were wiped out in the flood. The ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù seed of Satan would be the Edomites who John Hyrcanus forcefully converted to Judaism in the 2nd century BC IIRC. They are responsible for the perversions of the Torah that have transpired over the years. The blanket statement that ‚Äúall Jews are the seed of Satan‚Äù is false. The Bible is explicitly clear that the descendants of the 12 tribes will be redeemed in the end times.

"opiates","t5_2r0y3","With Vivitrol, it's thought that long-term antagonism of mu receptors might cause them to over-sensitize, which is different from losing tolerance.

I don't think there's any mechanism by which a single shot of Narcan or even a couple doses of Narcan could achieve the same thing.   As we've all learned to our detriment, tolerance doesn't reverse that quickly.

Anecdotally, people do seem to overdose in clusters.  Like, someone will go two years without ODing and then OD three times in four days or twice in one afternoon. 

But I don't believe that has anything to do with Narcan reducing tolerance.  I believe that's usually because they're still using the dangerous batch of drugs that caused them to OD the first time.  I've known people who *deliberately bought the stuff they overdosed on because it was such ""fire"" it almost killed them*!  They thought they could manage it with smaller doses, but maybe it was just badly mixed with too many hotspots?  So another 911 call, another round of Narcan.  

Even when it's not intentional, a lot of people aren't going to throw out a batch even if they overdosed on it.  And a batch that's causing ODs is probably either more potent or less well mixed than their usual batches.

A second thing is when people OD on something with a longer half-life than Narcan's. That can cause them to re-overdose without even taking any new drugs.  Narcan bumps the fentanyl off the receptors, but the fentanyl remains in the body for its natural lifespan, and when the shorter-acting Narcan leaves, the fentanyl reattaches and boom - another OD.  That's why the ER wants to hold people for a while for observation.

When people are given too much Narcan and feeling the awful precips, they tend to overshoot it on their next dose.  They're in pain and want to be sure to take enough to overcome the Narcan and end the dopesickness.  That can combine with Narcan's short half life to produce a new OD.  The person takes a huge shot to overcome the Narcan.  Initially they're OK. But over the next hour, the Narcan wears off and the huge shot finally hits them and they fall out again.

I think those are much more likely reasons for people overdosing multiple times in one day or many times over a few days.  

The idea of Narcan *rapidly* lowering tolerance is just urban legend.  People have clusters of ODs, but they're usually happening at the same time that others in the same area are having a spike in ODs.  Meaning, it's probably a more dangerous batch than usual.  Even when people throw out the purchase that caused the OD and buy a fresh one, they're still usually buying from a supply that's been causing an unusual number of overdoses.",1614557008

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend vampires or skaven to a first time player. Both are hated, which makes diplomacy and trade difficult. A lot of the really powerful skaven mechanics aren‚Äôt obvious, like spamming food to settle at high tier all the time. Vampire economy sucks early game and their units are trash. If you aren‚Äôt good at magic, you‚Äôll struggle. The free skelly spam with winds of death to kill enemies is NOT a beginner strat. 

Play high elves, recommend Tyrion as he‚Äôs the easiest early game. Plenty of trade opportunities and the HE tier 0 unit, basic archers, is amazing. For a new player, get a few spearmen to block and 12 or so archers. Get 2 bolt throwers to destroy towers in sieges ASAP. Don‚Äôt build any barracks, use the slot for growth or money. Get trade agreements with everyone except saphery, they‚Äôre assholes.

"argentina","t5_2qlht","### Resumen de la noticia

&gt;La tributaci√≥n de la agricultura argentina resulta en un bajo desempe√±o cr√≥nico de la econom√≠a nacional, incluidas crisis frecuentes y severas‚Äù.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En realidad, de forma directa o indirecta, el campo argentino emplea a m√°s de dos millones de personas, el 14% de la poblaci√≥n activa, y apenas aporta el 10% al Producto Interior Bruto.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúMi abuelo Hugo, el fundador de la empresa, ten√≠a campos en Santa Fe, en Recreo, la zona m√°s cara y con mayores rendimientos, el polo sojero de Argentina.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; El problema radica en que Argentina nunca lleg√≥ a ser potencia industrial.
&gt;
&gt;La industria argentina fue fomentada y protegida hasta que la dictadura de 1976 rompi√≥ con esa pol√≠tica.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En 1976, cuando el mundo padec√≠a la crisis de los choques petroleros, el PIB de Argentina ascend√≠a a 51.000 millones de d√≥lares.
&gt;
&gt;Hoy, la econom√≠a argentina ‚Äúpesa‚Äù algo m√°s de 80.000 millones de d√≥lares.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Suele considerarse que los a√±os ochenta fueron la ‚Äúd√©cada perdida‚Äù para la econom√≠a argentina.
&gt;
&gt;Pero, considerando la evoluci√≥n macroecon√≥mica y pese al dinero f√°cil de los noventa, cuando, con el presidente Carlos Menem, un peso equival√≠a a un d√≥lar, y pese a los a√±os dorados de N√©stor Kirchner (2003-2007), en los que gracias al brutal saneamiento forzado por el colapso de 2001-2002 y al alza de los precios de la soja se logr√≥ crecer mucho con poca inflaci√≥n, Argentina lleva muchas d√©cadas perdidas.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; El economista Mart√≠n Rapetti estima que, en t√©rminos reales, el producto bruto por habitante en Argentina es hoy casi el mismo que en 1974.
&gt;
&gt;Ripetti, entrevistado por el diario _Clar√≠n_, hace un pron√≥stico sombr√≠o: contando con que la econom√≠a argentina crezca un 6% en 2021 y luego siga creciendo a un ritmo ininterrumpido del 4,5% anual, algo bastante improbable, no se recuperar√° el nivel de vida de 2011 hasta 2027.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","I think we shouldn't jump to conclusions in terms of content yet, regarding BSDP. But yes, I am scared, too. Everything that's inferior to Platinum in terms of content would be a direct no for me. Honestly, I was hoping we'd see content improvements going in so many directions. I was especially hoping for following Pokemon, but with this artstyle and what we have seen so far, those are  out of the question.

What's especially concerning for me is that they didn't show a single new thing in the trailer. Even in the first gameplay trailer for ORAS, as far as I remember, they showed new Megas or at least something new (on top of the artstyle already being completely new compared to the original games).

I'll just hope that they'll show improvements and additional content, but the artstyle itself is a huge turnoff for me already. Not only do the character models look ugly to me, but, as I have read somewhere here on the subreddit, the style in which these remakes are made already limits in which direction they could expand compared to the original.

Wow, I almost forgot what I wanted to write in the first place, so here it is: While Link's Awakening certainly wasn't a game that could last longer than said 20-25 hours, it still was a beautiful remake. It was very faithful to the original and maybe could have expanded on the original a bit more, but at least it looked really, really nice. To be honest, I don't think BDSP look nearly as nice, not even the environments. So, unless they don't overhaul the graphics immensely...",1614557009

&gt;&gt; # [Expectativa por los anuncios judiciales de Alberto ante el Congreso](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/politica/365)
&gt;
&gt;**Desde varios sectores del Frente de Todos esperan definiciones y anuncios concretos** en torno a la Reforma Judicial, sobre las leyes que est√°n frenadas en el Congreso pero tambi√©n nuevas iniciativas surgidas del Consejo Asesor, sobre la nueva ley de Inteligencia y si va a encarar una depuraci√≥n real de los tribunales desde la c√∫pula hacia abajo.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hay dos proyectos de ley que ya tienen media sanci√≥n y **est√°n trabados en Diputados por falta de n√∫meros: el de Reforma Judicial y la modificaci√≥n de la ley del Ministerio P√∫blico Fiscal.** El oficialismo no tiene qu√≥rum propio y necesita del acompa√±amiento de los pocos diputados que responden a Roberto Lavagna y al gobernador de C√≥rdoba Juan Schiaretti.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **El proyecto de Reforma Judicial que tiene media sanci√≥n no preocupa a la cofrad√≠a de jueces y fiscales que gobiernan los tribunales con la impunidad de sus privilegios y sus fueros medi√°ticos.** La propia CFK en una de sus cartas p√∫blicas plante√≥ que el pa√≠s se merece una verdadera Reforma Judicial que no es la que envi√≥ el Gobierno al Congreso.
&gt;
&gt;La salida, eval√∫an desde el bloque del Frente de Todos, es la modificaci√≥n de la ley del Ministerio P√∫blico para, entre otras cosas, poder designar a un nuevo procurador con una mayor√≠a absoluta de los senadores (la mitad m√°s uno de los miembros de la c√°mara, 37).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **[Otro mensaje claro del m√°ximo tribunal fue la confirmaci√≥n de una condena contra Milagro Sala](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/politica/justicia/condena-a-milagro-sala-una-respuesta-de-la-corte-suprema-al-presidente-20212111940), un fallo pol√≠tico sin ning√∫n efecto pr√°ctico ni jur√≠dico.** Fue una condena a dos a√±os de prisi√≥n cuando lleva 5 de presa pol√≠tica.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Esta semana **[la misma Corte aval√≥ la manipulaci√≥n del Consejo de la Magistratura durante el Gobierno de Mauricio Macri](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/politica/lawfare-la-corte-avalo-la-manipulacion-del-consejo-en-la-era-macri-2021226603)**para lograr la suspensi√≥n y el inicio de un jury al camarista Eduardo Freiler, que no se alineaba con las directivas de la Mesa Judicial de Cambiemos y es, adem√°s, el √∫nico juez en la historia que pidi√≥ una indagatoria contra H√©ctor Magnetto.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **La pregunta que ronda entre las filas del oficialismo es si es posible imaginar una Reforma Judicial real con esta Corte Suprema.** Uno de sus miembros, Ricardo Lorenzetti, fue quien brind√≥ cobertura e impulso al lawfare.
&gt;
&gt;En el Consejo Asesor de la Reforma Judicial el tema Corte es donde hubo m√°s diferencias.
&gt;
&gt;En lo que s√≠ coincidi√≥ la mayor√≠a es en que la Oficina de Escuchas tiene que salir de la √≥rbita cortesana y en que tiene que estar m√°s claro el funcionamiento de la Corte, por ejemplo en torno al uso del art√≠culo 280 por el cu√°l resuelven centenares de casos al a√±o sin justificar.
&gt;
&gt;Es el movimiento m√°s importante hasta ahora en materia de Reforma Judicial.

This has become a question among my friends, several agreeing with me several agreeing with her. My friend and I are mostly over it but I know I will never eat her cooking or let my child. On wards!

My son is 18month &amp; I'm 35f, I'm vegeterian. I will not cook meat. Im raising my son vegeterian until he can make his own decision when he's much older. 

I'm not preachy, I actually don't even bring up being vegeterian, I don't make comments about my friends eating meat unless they are literally shoving it in my face which said friend has done. 

I was at friends house a week ago &amp; another friend &amp; I had brought a ton of finger foods etc, cheese plates, fruit bowls &amp; a meat plate from publix. 

After mom shaming me for giving my son caramel popcorn (he's 35lbs so bigger than most kids his age but it's not fat he is on the right growth line) even though her skinnier niece was eating a snickers (2 months older) she handed my son pepperoni. 

Luckily my son smelled it and threw it on the floor. But after telling her not to do that she told me that if she was watching him it was her choice to give him meat or not. 

I've tried to equate it to if she had kid's &amp; didn't want them eating processed sugars me doing what she's doing but she says meat &amp; sugar are different. 

This has turned into an arguement where I won't eat at her house because she's joked about putting meat broth in the vegeterian food. Am I the asshole for now not letting her around my child by herself? Some friends agree with her some agree with me, we've yelled about this &amp; stopped talking for a day or two.

&gt;&gt; # [La crisis perpetua de Argentina](https://elpais.com/internacional/2021-02-27/2627)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; La actividad econ√≥mica en [Argentina](https://elpais.com/noticias/argentina/) se derrumb√≥ durante el a√±o fat√≠dico de 2020.
&gt;
&gt;[En 2002, cuando Argentina colaps√≥,](https://elpais.com/noticias/corralito-financiero/) la ca√≠da fue s√≥lo un poco superior: 10,9%.
&gt;
&gt;La inflaci√≥n es muy elevada [(38,5% en los √∫ltimos doce meses y repuntando),](https://elpais.com/economia/2021-01-14/argentina-cierra-2020-con-una-inflacion-del-361.html) la moneda no deja de devaluarse, las reservas del Banco Central no llegan a 3.000 millones de d√≥lares y cuatro de cada diez argentinos viven en la pobreza.
&gt;
&gt;Desde 1980 [ha suspendido cinco veces los pagos de su deuda externa](https://elpais.com/economia/2020-08-04/argentina-anuncia-un-acuerdo-sobre-la-deuda-con-sus-principales-acreedores.html)(nadie en el mundo iguala esa marca de impagos) y es, ahora mismo, el [principal deudor del Fondo Monetario Internacional](https://elpais.com/economia/2020/01/28/actualidad/1580231710_228126.html), con 44.000 millones de d√≥lares a devolver.
&gt;
&gt;Por un lado, [renegoci√≥ en largas sesiones telem√°ticas la deuda con los acreedores privados](https://elpais.com/economia/2020-11-01/argentina-una-renegociacion-en-pandemia.html) y consigui√≥ un aplazamiento de los pagos y una sensible rebaja de los intereses.
&gt;
&gt;El Banco Central emiti√≥ durante 2020 m√°s de 1,2 billones de pesos [(fueron contratadas imprentas en Brasil y Espa√±a](https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-07-16/argentina-imprime-pesos-las-24-horas-del-dia-pero-sigue-faltando-papel-moneda.html) porque las dos f√°bricas argentinas de moneda ya trabajaban las 24 horas), con el riesgo de que la inflaci√≥n se agravara.
&gt;
&gt;En 1984, cuando Argentina sal√≠a de su dictadura m√°s t√©trica, el premio Nobel de Econom√≠a[Paul Samuelson](https://elpais.com/diario/2009/12/14/necrologicas/1260745201_850215.html) (1915-2009) expres√≥ sin bromear una idea parecida: ‚ÄúArgentina es el cl√°sico ejemplo de una econom√≠a cuyo estancamiento relativo no parece ser consecuencia del clima, las divisiones raciales, la pobreza malthusiana o el atraso tecnol√≥gico.
&gt;
&gt;Ciertamente, durante 2018 el peso perdi√≥ el 40% de su valor y el enorme pr√©stamo recibido del FMI se evapor√≥ en coberturas desesperadas del d√©ficit fiscal y en operaciones especulativas (gran parte de los 44.000 millones de d√≥lares recibidos acabaron en el extranjero o en cajas de seguridad); cuando [en las primarias de agosto de 2019 se constat√≥ que el peronismo iba a regresar](https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/08/12/argentina/1565561040_918945.html)al poder, los mercados burs√°tiles se hundieron, el peso se devalu√≥ otro 38% y hubo que restablecer los controles cambiarios, el llamado ‚Äúcepo‚Äù, para evitar el colapso.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚ÄúEl d√≥lar no es una variable m√°s, sino un term√≥metro que refleja c√≥mo van la econom√≠a y la pol√≠tica, adem√°s de un instrumento de ahorro‚Äù, se√±ala Marina Luzzi, coautora junto a Ariel Wilkis del libro [_El d√≥lar, historia de una moneda argentina_.](https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/10/04/argentina/1570211542_738999.html) Argentina nunca consigue generar tantos d√≥lares como necesita, por lo que, seg√∫n Luzzi, los controles cambiarios (los particulares no pueden comprar m√°s de 200 d√≥lares por mes) son una necesidad.

"WANDAVISION","t5_zlrg5","My guess is a lot of the unanswered questions were just misdirects.  The Marvel rule is you shouldn't have to watch other movies/shows to understand the movie/series you're currently watching.  

So leave out all of the Evan Peters/X-men crossover questions.  Show him morphing back into Senior Scratchy and that answers everything about Fietro.

The director, showrunners, and writers have said the show is about grief and finding hope.

Agatha - short fight where she can't beat Wanda being too powerful.

Hayward and Monica represent 2 ways of dealing with trauma:  ignoring/suppressing, which leads to isolation, versus compassion and empathy which lead to healing.

Cataract attacks, enrages Wanda to the point she can't control her chaos magic.  Monica convinces Agatha to help--Agatha's origin story was similar--too powerful, needed mentoring to learn to control her abilities, and was instead attacked by her own coven.  Seeing herself in Wanda's shoes, is the definition of empathy.  If Wanda is the cause, Wanda has to be the solution.

Cryfest ending (that's how Teyonah Parris described it):  Vision and the twins aren't real in the sense that they can't exist outside of the Hex.  But they are real in the sense that they live within Wanda.  So they disappear when she closes the Hex, but there's the hope and promise that she can recreate them again when she learns to control her abilities.  And it goes with the theme that those we love are always with us.

Agent Woo does a magic trick to distract Hayward, then knocks him out.  World Security Council Director Fury arrives to relieve Hayward of command and place him under arrest.

The rest of the unanswered questions like Monica's engineer, addressed in mid &amp; post credit scenes.

At least those are the major plot points I'm expecting them to hit and still stay in the 1 hour screen time.",1614557012

Thank you for your detailed reply. I am not oblivious to the risks of using USB bays, I just don't, for *reasons*, have a huge choice in the matter. Which is why of my three pools, I put the one that I can afford to lose access to for a while on the USB bay. It's still a massive headache, but it's not world-ending.

&gt; The good news is that your data is likely intact. You can read the gpt specification to understand what the gpt table looks like. Then you can do a hexdump of the first couple of megabytes of the drive, and find the offset, then create a loop device of your hard drive with that offset.

Okay, I've got to admit: I just went crosseyed. I'm not sure that I can do that. Even Googling the ""gpt specification"" doesn't help me find what I think it is I'm looking for (that is, something I might be able to recognize while reading it in a hex editor?). I also only vaguely know what an offset is, and theoretically what a loop device is. I can figure out how to do the hexdump, I think.

It's not your problem, obviously, but if you have links to resources that could help me figure this out, that would be great. Otherwise, it sounds like it might just be easier to rebuild the pool, restore the data, and painstakingly recreate all the shares and symlinks and permission bits, etc.",1614557013

 I spent all my savings onto this: $14k, so hopefully it won't dip below 660, so I can sell all those stocks for like 660 times 400 = 264k - 14k, a cool 250k profit.

But I found a passable way to keep my party from engaging fights and encounters they are not capable of handling yet. I often use strong and trustworthy NPCs to tell them the encounter is to hard. If they get told by a high lvl ex-adventurer barbarian NPC who now is the chief of the town's guard they might trust him when he says the lich is too strong. If a poor merchant says the same they might think his word is not worthy enough because he has no experience with fighting.

Cool encounters for a magical world without TPKs:
- large tree near the road with fairies and/or a totem that activates a nonlethal wild magic source.
- dragons fighting in the distance
-a graveyard with a friendly ghost Gravekeeper who trades lore against something
- a merchant with flying horses towing his cart.
- an area with a totally different season. It's summer? So for one mile there is snow. If they search for the reason the find a retired adventurer wizard or something. Magically changing the weather because he hates the summer. He offers stew and stories. 
- a magic portal they have no clue how to use. And a guardian who makes clear there is no chance. 

And if all things go bad. And you presented them an encounter they can't win and aren't supposed to do yet. Just tell them. Say sorry Bois we fucked up. If you go there you die. Or change the encounter if you have the time. They won't find the dragon. Just his kid. But will die nearly anyways. The will think two times fighting his parents.",1614557014

It was closer to where I worked and the manager of the elderly community liked me because I reminded her of her grandson. For eight years, she never raised my rent and we used to chill out on the porch with a cigarette and the SoCal ocean breeze down the street. She was still old skool about me bringing women over, but I‚Äôd sneak them in anyway; I know she probably knew but didn‚Äôt say anything. 

 I moved away twelve years ago to move across the country for my career. I‚Äôm married now with a kid and we still keep in contact.

"ethereum","t5_2zf9m","Yeah, I think the way they're implemented now, these digital art NFT's are useless.  I can see value in creating tokens for works of art like certificates of ownership, but you _need_ an authoritative figure that actually does verification.  There's nothing to stop me right now from minting an NFT on rarible for something I didn't actually create.  Or I can just slightly modify an existing artwork and essentially mint a counterfeit.  Potentially it could get caught, but just like real counterfeits (lol) I may be able to sell it before that happens.  In fact, rarible itself even admits in their [ToS](https://rarible.com/terms.pdf) :

&gt;There can be no guarantee or assurance of the uniqueness, originality or quality of any Collectibleor Collectible Metadata. In the absence of an express legal agreement between the creator of a Collectible and purchasers of the Collectible, there cannot be any guarantee or assurance that the purchase or holding of the Collectible confers any license to or ownership of the Collectible Metadataor other intellectual property associated with the Collectibleor any other right or entitlement, notwithstanding that User may rightfully own or possess the NFT associated with the Collectible. 

oof

The real harm is that ""NFT"" is becoming synonymous with these these digital art tokens, but there are so many other (and probably more useful) use cases for NFT's which have nothing to do with this.  NFT's for event tickets, real-estate ownership, or other things where the minting is controlled but not the sale/trade, has a huge potential.  But it's going to be a lot more difficult for those use-cases to gain traction if people immediately think of these random gifs when they see ""NFT"".",1614557015

It took many iterations to get both the T-64 and T-80 to work well enough, BMP-1's autoloader exists basically to be removed (hyperbole but yeah), MIG-23 apparently gave people fits getting it to work right, etc, etc.

If it's just the AK, the AK had a slower rollout which helped it have a more gentle breaking in period, and went through several iterations before mass fielding too.  I would argue in terms of weapon maturity timelines, the AKM we all know and love is closer to the M16A2 of the AK family than it is the initial version of the weapon.

Like there's no magical socialist solution best to weapons design.  The same human factors of corner cutting, questionable design choices, old guard designers/leadership play out regardless of military, and you'd be hard pressed to find a country that really does it especially well.",1614557015

&gt;&gt; _AIDA filed a legal brief before the Supreme Court of Mendoza arguing the unconstitutionality of a decree allowing for unconventional oil and gas drilling through hydraulic fracturing in the Argentine province._
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **Mendoza, Argentina.** In support of a lawsuit filed by Argentine ally OIKOS, the Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA) filed a ‚Äúfriend of the court‚Äù brief claiming the unconstitutionality of local regulations allowing for the exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons, known as fracking.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Several [studies](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/15/20805136/climate-change-fracking-methane-emissions) of fracking in the United States have posited that leakage and flaring during fracking operations are associated with a significant increase of methane in the atmosphere.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; AIDA‚Äôs brief joins others filed by national and international organizations against the decree regulating fracking in Mendoza, including [Xumek](https://xumek.org.ar/comunicado-sobre-el-acceso-a-la-justicia-en-cuestiones-ambientales/), [FARN](https://farn.org.ar/farn-se-opone-a-una-reglamentacion-del-fracking-a-la-medida-de-las-empresas-y-en-contra-de-la-proteccion-del-ambiente-en-mendoza/) (Environment and Natural Resource Foundation) and [Earthjustice](https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2021/earthjustice-supports-fracking-challenge-in-mendoza-argentina).

"houkai3rd","t5_3jjhl","Evil doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean inherently bad though. Many great villains are evil without even realizing they‚Äôre evil until happening upon some grand (or even small) epiphany. Sauron from LoTR for example is evil but, doesn‚Äôt view himself that way and in a certain respect doesn‚Äôt have entirely evil intentions. His ultimate goal is to bring permanent order to Middle Earth after all and simply sees himself as the only way to achieve that order, by installing himself as a god like figure after conquering the free peoples. He also used to be a good guy, so he‚Äôs evil but, not necessarily inherently bad. 

Otto similarly is evil without a doubt but, not inherently bad. He has admirable intentions and I doubt he even sees what he‚Äôs doing as evil but, rather, as unfortunate necessity. His goal, after reviving Kallen for example, could be to resurrect everyone that‚Äôs died directly or indirectly by his actions. So he isn‚Äôt inherently bad but, he certainly is evil. 

Rita, being so willing to blindly follow Otto (or perhaps not so blindly) isn‚Äôt inherently bad but, this most certainly makes her evil. Fu Hua is the same way (essentially) until she steps out on Otto because he‚Äôs getting innocent people killed. It begs the question though: why would Fu Hua help Otto create a Herrscher knowing it could kill lots of people.",1614557018

And the NDP do? How do you know the Liberals have no plan? They literally last promised it for the program of this session of parliament in the last throne speech. What do you want, daily updates on negotiations and civil-servant number crunching? 

You can bring up 1997, but its not like the Liberals have promised it at every election since. There's been four party leaders and three prime ministers since. Take focus on the recent promise, which its far to early to say that's its broken. And I hate to break it to you, but even if all provinces were on board, and the NDP were in power, there's no way they could get pharmacare done before the pandemic is over.

"VRGaming","t5_2x5up","Exactly this.  I've owned a few headsets and the Quest 2's screen is fantastic as long as you are in a bright, colourful environment.  In dark games/areas the lack of depth to blacks is clear in comparison to OLED screens and there is always a slight halo effect of brightness around the edge of your view.

I've still yet to see a better screen than the Quest 2 though (Reverb G2 is likely the only consumer headset that beats it) and it is a minor annoyance more than made up for by the lack of screen door effect and resolution.  For games like Squadrons (or any sim racer/sim flight combat) the higher resolution means that you can distinguish things at greater distance better, this is compounded by a combination of the lenses used and sim gaming tending to focus on one point on the horizon so the more detail you can get at that sweet spot the better.  Honestly the difference in moving from Quest 1 to Quest 2 was astounding in that respect, biggest leap in screen of any headset upgrade I've experienced.",1614557018

Even though it doesn't provide her with the solution she expected, she finally finds the courage to accept that Landon's gone by the end of the episode, and even admits that she's gonna need some help dealing with it. 

The prism is a very helpful when used for it's intended purpose : rehearse conversations. After all, it gets Hope to say she loves Landon out loud and makes her realize that he's in danger. However, it's a lot more simplistic than the box, because it's just a representation of someone based on what the user knows about them. The box is a complex artefact that analyses the subconscious and creates a scenario to help deal with the issues. You're not your own therapist in the box, the box is the therapist.

"lrcast","t5_330dh","Currently 2-1 with this build in Bo1. I think I‚Äôll listen to you and cut the white splash.
Piloting this deck I realized how powerful behold is and I think I will include the fifth copy. 
Then cutting the augurs might be the right choice for I already have all the card draw I need. What I also realized, being new to the format, is that Narfi buffs both zombies and snow creatures and it is with them that my deck is trying to win the late game, so yeah Hawk and recruiter could easily go in. 

With that we have 5th copy behold, hawk, stroke, recruiter and kinseekers but that‚Äôs five cards and I really am dubious on what to cut.
The ring overperformed during last game, it went off with a Caller out, letting me dump all the mana into it. 

Then there‚Äôs the fact that with that many beholds in the lategame it can basically let me cycle through my deck, I dunno it seems I can use all that mana well. :/
Do you think Kinseeker is that good?

"thetagang","t5_27n9fl","How do you calculate your returns?

I write options against margin. I usually manage 100-200 positions across 20 stocks or so. Because each stock has a different margin requirement, which can also change based on strike price and DTE, I don't track the individual Buying Power to hold my short positions open. Also, how do you factor in time to your calculation? When you have multiple positions that are open for different periods of time, the water gets muddy fairly quickly. 

I've taken a rather simplistic approach and just calculate the returns based on my portfolio value on a YTD basis. While this does include a few long positions, they are relatively minor in size when compared to my option writing. Because I'm using my portfolio value, this calculation is assuming I am using 100% of it at all times. It's not perfect, but is a good enough estimation for me right now. Would love some feedback on how others calculate their returns on writing options.

Last week hurt a bit, prior to it I was at a YTD 21% return on my entire portfolio value. Today it is at 10%. Last year I added substantial capital throughout the year, so there isn't any easy calculation, but I would guess I did over 100% returns on money that was in the market for 8 months or more.",1614557019

"webhosting","t5_2qn3h","My primary line of defense is Cloudflare so I am slightly less worried about how fast the server is updated. Open source might be good enough for this configuration.

DO offers CPU-dedicated VPS, is that really going to be so different from a dedicated server? I'm leaning towards DO because I already have an account there and find the UX easy to use, and prices aren't far from AWS and GCP. 

I primarily have just one large client (3M hits per month) with 1 production site and six development instances. I also have a handful of small clients where performance is not an issue. For the large client I don't think I need a load-balanced production system or anything like that, as Cloudflare takes most of the load. 

Does that change your recommendation?",1614557020

Therefore, when it comes to stuff that's banned in China and not available outside of China (because people of the world don't really care about small local band in some remote Chinese town), they are quite hard to find.

And for the censorship, I think the Chinese government just like to have that power that controls everything without explaining; they aren't ACTUALLY sensitive about these minor things. For example there are quite a lot Chinese movies that depict heavy violence (probably at a similar level as the Deerhunter or Saving Private Ryan) and is available for all age, as long as it praises China.",1614557020

"thenetherlands","t5_30hrx","De vraag is een beetje wat men in die tijd wist over wat er gaande was. Als men (als gewone burger) geen idee had over de erbarmelijke omstandigheden waarin slaven leefden kan ik me nog wel voorstellen dat men geen afgunst had richting slavernij, maar als men dat w√©l wist vraag ik mij af wat voor moraal men had en waarom. Indien het hier gaat om een legitieme ""Wir haben es nicht gewu√üt"" vind ik dat de Nederlandse staat zich wel verantwoordelijk mag rekenen voor foutieve informatieverstrekking, onderdrukking en belangenverstrengeling.

EDIT: ik denk ook dat het doel is dat Nederland en de Nederlandse Staat afstand doet van het verleden. In plaats van ""die mensen waren slecht"" zou het meer ""hier stonden we vroeger misschien wel achter, maar nu niet meer, en z√≥ gaan we ervoor zorgen dat het niet nog een keer gebeurd"" moeten zijn. Hierin zie ik Duitsland als voorbeeld; er is daar w√©l goede voorlichting over de donkere pagina's van het land, en men doet daar expliciet afstand van zonder dat men het probeert onder de mat te schuiven. Ik zou het prettig vinden als Nederland dezelfde aanpak zou hanteren. Het gaat mij er niet om dat we mensen in een kwaad daglicht stellen; meer dat we open kaart spelen over ons duistere verleden en daar afstand van nemen",1614557022

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","I understand the sensitivity of the question. I understand the plea to morality. I am simply saying that in a world of near infinite choices such as the one we live in, there is simply no equivalence between consensual exchange and forcing exchange. 

A persons circumstances are not the result of the actions of the party making the offer and do not necessarily have to influence the calculus of the offering party. 

Similarity, the circumstances of the person receiving the services are not the work of the person agreeing to provide them. There is not interdependency between the two. There is no correlation. There is no causation. It just is. 

Just because I can hire a contractor with a fancy ass truck and an office of granite and glass for 200.00 per hour doesn‚Äôt mean that hiring a guy from out front the Home Depot for 15.00 per hour is exploitation. That day laborer with no other skills who cannot speak the language has no problem at all with framing my shed for a fraction of the possible cost I might pay.

I don't see how I'm causing harm to anyone whether they choose to give me anything or not. If anyone saw my post on social media about it and didn't want to participate, that's perfectly fine. Asking for something without expecting your request to be fulfilled isn't really wrong. If I asked someone for the last bit they have left and expected they give it to me, or get upset if they refuse, or offered them ""exposure,"" then yeah, that's morally ridiculous. But if you think everytime someone simply asks for something, you're going to be angry at the world a lot of the time.

"ffxivdiscussion","t5_22ly7r","Alts are honestly what kept me playing this game. I don't like the idea of my main being proficient at everything and it was fun to make new characters that had their own separate stories. 

I do have to agree that the game is not alt friendly as it involves a lot of repeating the same things you've already done, which I don't mind, and a lot of things you'd buy on mogstation is only for one character. I skipped a lot of content on my alts, but I completed Eureka with an alt since I never bothered to do it with my main. That for me added more to the world building cuz it showed that while my main continues to fight the empire, another adventurer is traveling across the dangerous islands of Eureka. In terms of actually getting through content you've already done yeah it could suck sometimes but for me alts are a good way to add more interesting characters and expand the world.

"technology","t5_2qh16","If you want the number of jets that have been paid for, then that's a hard number to pin down due to how orders are split into annual contracts.

That said, the current program of records (how many jets each nation would like to buy) is currently &gt;700, with additional nations showing interest (Switzerland, Finland, Canada, Croatia, Spain). In addition, some customers like Singapore and Israel expected to increase their orders in the near future (Singapore is currently only buying 4 jets to evaluate the F-35, but they're expected to buy 40-60 if they like it; Israel meanwhile has already ordered 50 but has just declared they want to increase that to 75).

As a bit of an example though, the latest contract for jets was a 3-year production plan for 478 jets, of which 291 were for the US and the remainder 187 (39% of the total) were for allies.

To put things in perspective, the total number of Eurofighter Typhoons sold globally is around 700, the total number of Dassault Rafales ordered is now IIRC up to around 200-300, etc.",1614557024

"OnePunchMan","t5_2vm97","Garou's motivation isn't stupid, but his solution sure is. 

His classmates didn't like him so they labelled him the ""monster."" Once that happened, it became socially acceptable for people to hurt him. And those people were called ""heroes."" 

This is Garou's problem, and it's a serious one. It's cruel, it's unfair, and it has to stop. But how? Beating up ""heroes"" is obviously not the solution, but Garou lets his anger take control because he doesn't know what else to do. He's a dummy and Saitama lets him know, but the audience is left with an awareness of Garou's problem and an invitation to come up with their *own* solution.

*bonus: though Garou idolizes the concept of ""monster"" as it was taught to him, he looks down on members of the monster association, as any ethical person would.",1614557024

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;But the initial issue that made it to the news was the claim that the police didn't knock or announce themselves at all, which wasn't true. The news jumped to conclusions.

The warrant they initially applied for was a no-knock warrant. It was sometime later changed to ""knock and announce"".  The misunderstanding is reasonable.

Oh, and regarding the knocking/announcing:  ""The New York Times interviewed roughly a dozen neighbors and alleged that **only one of them**, who was on the exterior staircase immediately above Taylor's apartment, **heard the officers shout ""Police!"" once and knock at least three times**, while approximately **11 other neighbors heard no knock or announcement, including one who was outside smoking a cigarette.**""

Hmm.

&gt;The police had the right house.

Did they now?   ""The search warrant included Taylor's residence because it was suspected that Glover received packages containing drugs there..."".  The cops claim this was verified ""through a US Postal Inspector"". In May 2020, the U.S. postal inspector in Louisville publicly announced that the collaboration with law enforcement **had never actually occurred**. 

Supposedly, the cops went thru a different agency, the Shivley PD.  ""Jaynes said that before the raid on Taylor's apartment Mattingly told him that the Shively PD had reported that the United States Postal Service **had not delivered any suspicious packages to that address**.""

So, the cops LIED to get the warrant.  Oh, and the sky is blue, and water is wet.

Cop also lied again: ""For each of his five warrants, Jaynes used identical language seeking to justify the no-knock entry: ""These drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence, have cameras on the location that compromise Detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made, and have a history of fleeing from law enforcement.""""  Besides the 'begging the question' fallacy (referring to the *suspects* as ""drug traffickers""), Taylor had no such cameras, and no history of fleeing or destroying evidence.

When they get away with such blatant lies, no wonder the media doesn't believe them when they say they knocked.

&gt;I'm willing to call less than 30 cases of police killing innocent people out of 60,000,000 interactions practically non-existent.

1) 30 cases *...that we know of.* We only hear about the ones that make the national news. How many don't?

2) 30 *killings*.  How many violations of the law and/or people's Rights where someone *didn't* happen to die?  How many where the cops *merely* violated someone's rights and let them live?

&gt;As for punishment, cops tried for murder are convicted more than 70% of the time.

Sure... *if it makes it to trial*.  But it rarely does.

&gt;when the actual facts exonerate the cops people believe the system is corrupt

See above- the ""actual facts"" are that the cops lied numerous times to get a warrant to raid a house that didn't need to be raided.

In fact, ""According to police grand-jury testimony, **the warrant was never executed and Taylor's apartment was not searched for drugs or money after the shooting.**""  Gee, the whole fucking point of the raid was to search the place... and the cops never searched the place??  Either they suck at their job... or the real reason they raided wasn't to search the place after all.",1614557024

As someone whose boyfriend is Indian, whose parents were born in Bangladesh, and who has Indian ancestry.... I personally don't accept that apology at all. If anything, her apology made everything else she said in the past more hurtful. 

Being an ally isn't just about being  able to and calling people out on their behavior. That's less than 1% of what being an ally should be about. 99.9% should be about holding yourself accountable and meaningful support to communities that have been historically mistreated. What resources are you sharing? How are you educating those around you? How are you volunteering to help? How are you educating yourself? How are you checking in and supporting your friends when they're the target of racist/transphobic/etc. behavior? How are you checking yourself and holding yourself accountable? 

If your allyship so far has been limited to calling out others, you have a long way to go. Allyship is not supposed to be a weapon with which to throw stones while you live in a glass house. If you want to call others out when they misbehave, make sure you are the able to call yourself out first.",1614557024

It‚Äôs 2021 at this point and I‚Äôd guess I‚Äôd expect the bare minimum out of something like the winx saga especially Netflix. There‚Äôs so much great shows on Netflix with good queer representation but this isn‚Äôt one of them. 

If you were someone who was gay or perhaps just more knowledgeable on the issue you would notice all of the little details and things that they did that were fucked up. 

And my original comment wasn‚Äôt even about all of it. I‚Äôm not going to get into queer coding villains and that nonsense. 

I‚Äôm sorry if you got butthurt that I criticized your favorite show (which in all honestly isn‚Äôt that great anyways) but this is about a larger issue than just stupid fairies.

And again like I said before it‚Äôs not about me. It‚Äôs about the snow trying to take credit for something that they didn‚Äôt even do which in all honestly (even if you don‚Äôt understand) is a VALID criticism.

Edit: I never said that if they were to focus on a gay character it would be called queer baiting...that‚Äôs not queer baiting. Queer baiting is when you‚Äôre setting up two same sex characters and pandering or implying that there‚Äôs some sexual tension for profit.",1614557025

I feel like this is a classic case of Reddit N.T.A	= IRL AH.
You have no moral and legal obligation to this child until a paternity test comes back. That said, this woman is scared. She is struggling and the baby is a victim in all of this and needs help.

If you have the money, what would be the harm in 'loaning' her 500 until the paternity test is done? Pregnant women don't need stress and this can seriously effect her baby, and her delivery. Baby's need things. A car seat. A bassinet to sleep in. Clothes, bottles and formula. As an 8 month pregnant woman myself, I empathise with both sides here.

You have the chance to do something kind here.

Point is, there's a lot more shared culture between MI and FL than many people realize. This is not new, it's just recently gained national attention. When I was a mid-Michigan teen in the 90s, we lived less than an hour away from the Grand Dragon of the KKK, who then resided in Howell, MI. Oh, and...the KKK have held annual rallies outside the MI capitol building for longer than I can remember. And then there are the militias.

In 2020, Kojima was angry that his new project got cancelled.

Later Google Stadia undergoes changes and abandons Stadia Games and Entertainment.

The report about the Kojima title being Stadia exclusive gets out and Google responds with ""Well, we haven't officially announced anything, so the report is false, thx bye"".",1614557027

Price: go for Steam version.

Graphics: Steam or Oculus - whichever is cheaper. With some games offering crossbuy, paying a bit more for Oculus version can be a good selling point.

About 10% of the population is openly Queer when asked. Disparities in self-reported STD rates in the US have been found to be somewhat mitigated by victimization risks, after which the rate isn't significantly higher unless you have both male and female partners (surprise, the bigger your pool of sexual partners, the easier it is to get an STD, shock, horror. Be careful, my brothers and sisters). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575167/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575167/)

""They are 40 times more likely to molest children than heterosexuals""

Just a blatant bigoted lie. Studies that support the proposal that Queer people are more likely to molest children have been shown to be wrong time and time again for weaknesses in methodology and misunderstanding of child abusers in trying to divide them into 'heterosexual', 'homosexual' and 'bisexual' when their sexual desires disregard sex and gender entirely (which is why priests almost always molest boys, access and disregard). [https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts\_molestation.html](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html)

""46% of them have been molested as children themselves""

We do experience higher rates of 'childhood abuse' in general, that includes sexual abuse, which is a damn tragedy and a definite own goal if you're trying to say that it makes us bad that we were victimized for being different.

""Jones was born on August 5, 1982, in¬†Des Moines, Iowa. She attended eight schools in eight years while her single mother, Lori, often held down two jobs to support her family of six. Jones' father spent most of her childhood in the¬†Air Force¬†and later in state prison. When Jones was in third grade, her family settled in the basement of a Des Moines¬†Salvation Army¬†church. During the summer when day camps were offered at the church, Jones would wake up early to avoid being teased by other kids if they found out she was living in the basement.[9]
When her family was about to make another move, to¬†Forest City, Iowa, Jones told her mother, ""Mom, I can't go to a city that doesn't have a track. I'm trying to pursue my dream."" She was, however, mistaken, as Forest City High School did, in fact, have a track.[9]¬†""",1614557030

"cyberpunkgame","t5_3az7x","Haven't finished the story, (probable never will) but I just wanted to pop in and add that Johnny is one of the most annoying and cringe inducing bits of ""look how fucking cool we are"" shitty writing that I've seen in a long time

I got as far as the mission to jump the parade float/Judy planning a revolution/the very start of Maap Tan Pa'Lenn or whatever, and literally every time he appears it's to spout beyond clich√©d social commentary bullshit that's supposed to sound insightful, and ends up just making him sound like some edgy teen who just found one of those *Eat the Rich* type groups for the first time and thinks they're now the solution to CaPiTaLiSm

It'd be less aggressively annoying if the game had any real self-awareness about its own imagery, but the very strong sense I got from every interaction (bar one - the conversation after Panam's ambush mission) was that Cyberpunk the game clearly really unironically thinks he's the coolest fucking guy ever and actively berates you if you mistakenly think otherwise

By level 50 and the end of my interest in slogging through the story, I just can't help but feel like nearly everything that this game thinks is cool, I generally just find pathetic or even sad - from the constant 2edgy4u dialogue right the way through to the very worldbuilding the wardrobe options (THIS MAN HAVE LEATHER JACKET AND SUNGLASSES BECAUSE HE COOL MAN)

And since Cyberpunk is a game that's 70% style and barely 30% substance, that's a pretty huge caveat to have hanging over the whole already demonstrably broken experience

The only bright moment was when you have that chat with Johnny on a roadside bench after Panam's mission in Rocky Springs(?), and the game finally let me have a dialogue option that flat out told Johnny I found him kind of laughable and sad, and that he was essentially just a ""dog chasing cars; he wouldn't know what to do if he actually caught one"", as Heath Ledger's joker so delightfully puts it

Kind of wrote that interaction off as a fluke though, since it was a solitary example in a sea of interactions that were otherwise just how big Johnny's cock is, how many groupies he's fucked, how you should want to be cool like Johnny, and how totally real his angst is underneath all of those *exxxtreme* guitar riffs

I'd love to hear that literally anything changes going forward, but honestly I'd be pretty shocked",1614557031

I am so glad you said that because that is actually protected under a particular law

[RCW 50.20.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=50.20.050)

&gt;(iv) The separation was necessary to protect the claimant or the claimant's immediate family members from domestic violence, as defined in RCW¬†26.50.010, or stalking, as defined in RCW¬†9A.46.110.

It goes without saying I suppose that whatever information you have about domestic violence whether it is a temporary protection order or an anti-stalking or anti-harassment order, or a police report that you should probably upload that to the open case listed in ""Upload a Document"", and personally I would also include a typed document about what happened and why you left and reference the law above. That way when they do make the decision about your separation reason they have all of the relevant information. 

It would be a shame for them to disqualify you because you did not supply all the relevant information and then have to file an appeal and wait months with no benefits and then be granted the appeal after having provided the domestic violence information

About contacting your state reps or senators; they love it, this is the best case scenario that they could possibly ask for where the constituent actually relies on them to get something done that has a huge effect on the constituent themself. State reps or Senators go on campaigns to try to convince people to believe in them and that they will have an effect on their life, this is one of the only occurrences where the constituent will actually go to the State Rep to lobby the State Rep and not the other way around.

I get it, but the ""that guy"" in this circumstance is the guy who did not want to be the bother and waited until 15, 20 or 30 weeks until it was an extreme issue and then blast the State reps and ESD every day and freak out.",1614557032

If my eyes say, ""I want four scoops,"" I take only two scoops. 

I can always get more food if I'm still hungry. It's all about listening to your body. It completely eradicates the diet mentality. No deprivation, no going without: it's all about changing the way your mind sees food. It's free and you can start right away. 

I don't know you're situation but for me, I have some serious pounds to lose. I'm 5'7 and started at 238. I'm down to 219. I'm sure once I plateau, tracking calories will become necessary but for right now, I'm seeing fantastic results! 

I just ordered some resistance bands to start working out at home. I want to grow some muscle.(All of my weight gain is belly and thigh) 

I've been recommending mindful/intuitive eating to everyone I know because it's free and it changes how your mind looks at food. 

No more guilt. No more shame. Instead of beating yourself up because you had a twinkie, you read your body. Your body craved a twinkie and now you feel better because you're nourishing your body. 

Your body deserves nourishment. You deserve nourishment and there's no shame in that! Eventually, you reach the point where, ""I crave a twinkie but it's not nourishing: what's in that twinkie that my body wants?""

"digimon","t5_2rxw7","Yeah, speaking as someone who loves the Japanese version... it's true that the official subs tended to be. Pretty lackluster. Digivolve -&gt; evolve is actually accurate, as digivolve is a dub-only term, but the inconsistency in how it's said would probably be really jarring if watching too much. I think the Tamers netflix subs were... actually pretty consistent, at least? I watched the full series in fansub and then checked it out and found that it was more comprehensible than the 02 subs, at least.

In Adventure, evolving to Perfect (or Ultimate in dub) is actually called super evolution, so that might be why they got ""supercharge""? A more literal translation would be something like, ""Greymon, super evolve... MetalGreymon!""

Actually, I hated that about the Last Evolution subs- they used dub names and terms, and the text was so illegible, that at that point I was like, ""So why am I even watching this sub?"" It's not even a case of ""dub bad &gt;("" here so much as... if they are obviously saying names like Koushirou or Tailmon, having the subs read ""Izzy"" or ""Gatomon"" is distracting. :P That the Last Evolution dub kept the OG music and had some really good localization and performances was pretty awesome, though.

I think to avoid brand confusion, they'd need to put something like ""UNCUT"" on the box. I'd love to see them do to Digimon what they did for Sailor Moon and do an uncut dub with as much as the old cast as possible, but I'm assuming that Digimon just doesn't have the broad appeal that Sailor Moon does to make such a thing a worthy investment?",1614557033

\#1. Basically made your 360 a multidisk system. Want to watch a movie but too lazy to take out the game, boom this guy already has your King of the Hill season 2 dvd in the tray.  This was before streaming and downloadable content could be accessed on the 360.

\#2 It added an extra USB port that came in handy for charging your 2nd generation OG IPOD. 

\#3. This actually for me made it worth the price, you could connect the USB dongle to it.  Given the system could be placed away from the console allowed me to direction it just right to steal my grandmothers neighbors wifi.

Because kidnapping is obviously illegal and immoral. The only other option is to make abortions illegal at viability, which at the point if they want to no longer be pregnant, they can induce labor or get a C section.

But other than convincing women to not have abortions or convince doctors to not perform abortions, there's not really any magic teleport spell to safely remove babies from their mothers. I'm not sure how talking someone out of abortion is any more morally problematic than talking someone out of suicide.",1614557033

It rarely feels open and out of control. It just looks too organized and watching us play the way we play now I can't help but feel it shows little character. Players don't look like they are expressing who they are. They just try to be the cog in the machine of a system. This is partly why I feel a lot of the signings look so different to how they were in their previous teams. We aren't asking them to replicate what they did before joining us.
