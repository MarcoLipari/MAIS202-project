He‚Äôd show up at noon and leave at 5-6. He didn‚Äôt care what I did as long as I got it done. We had excellent turn around times.

He was definitely a mentor to me. He saw that I did a good job and reciprocated in the best possible way. He bought me lunch and beer and invited me to his house often. We were homies.

My current boss is not the same, but at least he has an insane amount of respect for me. He has treated me as the professional that I feel I am and has given me a tremendous amount of responsibility and pays me to compensate for it, he has high expectations to match but he has never been disappointed in delays because he understands how difficult what we are doing is.

Never switched on the trans PS. Still a shitbag for abandoning her responsibilities. I don't think trans people are inherently shitbags, but I feel that their situation in this line of work is in compatable with the Army life.

If you feel that I'm insulting you, well you wouldn't be the first. The take away:

- Soldiers should be present to deploy
- If you are hurt, get better
-If you really can't get better, consider an alternate line of work
- Being trans does not equal you being a shitbag
-Being trans means you have a preexisting condition
-Yes I consider Gender Dysphoria a preexisting condition 

Lastly, I think what you mean by inherent nature of being trans is the fact that being in the Army team means being an active participant in it.

Secondly, I listed some in my other reply, but if you want something with a bit of wiggle room and the ability to grow I'm going to suggest a setup that isn't a kit, but is battle tested.

For the mod, an IStick Pico. Any model is fine (except the dual). The 25 is more common than the OG, but the OG can be found pretty cheaply.

For the tank, a Nautilus 2 if you want MTL, a Super Tank Mini if you want DL.

Both are older, but coils are abundant for either tank. The STM is Atlantis compatible, so almost any coil in that class should work.

You can charge via USB with the Pico, I personally would recommend getting a second 18650 battery and an external charger. Less downtime. I also would never recommend charging it while you sleep.

If you want an internal battery mod, look at Innokin's offerings. They are the gold standard with internal battery mods. I will say I do like the Voopoo Drag Mini, but I haven't had it long enough to really recommend it. ",1541030400

I'm not sure about the maritimes, but for the western provinces there's only 1 year of kindergarten at age 5.  Alberta has a public pre-k for ESL kids, but that's it as far as I can tell.  Quebec has pre-k in a few schools across the province, but isn't universal.

From what I googled before posting (but didn't link), some provinces will have the parents pay out of pocket for preschool and then give subsidies based on income rather than it being a universal benefit paid for with taxes.  The feds are spending beaucoup dollars to have the provinces set up more early education / child care solutions, but that's again not a universal program (something that Paul Martin campaigned on back in 2004 or so).",1541030402

&gt; * Working long hours at menial jobs? Check.
&gt; * Thick accent in English? Check.
&gt; * Hard-for-locals-to-pronounce name? Check.

Sure if you scope backwards it applies to lots of things. But he was designed specifically to target Indian stereotypes.

Menial job? Sure. Convenience store? Pretty classically indian immigrants.

Thick accent? Yeah, lots of immigrants. Super exaggerated not realistic indian accent? Pretty specific there too.

Hard to pronounce name? Fair. Nahasapeemapetilon? Literally a mash up of one of the writer's Indian friend's name. 

&gt;The character of Apu could have been Farsi or Moroccan or Laotian and not much would have changed

Except those people aren't associated with at least half of the specifics of Apu's character. He is 100% an Indian stereotype, and that's best exemplified by the fact that INDIAN PEOPLE were the ones upset by him. If they weren't specific stereotypes, why would it bother them? If you change his race but leave everything else, he doesn't make sense. Thus he's clearly meant to be a joke about Indians. 

Also (and please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), I believe Farsi is a dialect of the Persian people. I am not aware of people identifying as Farsi. ",1541030403

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Its unlikely that there will ever be a single best philosophy for humanity.

Super true.  it's a kind of degenerate state.

&gt; But at least, the study of philosophy, which usually includes the recognition that there are other worldviews, different interpretations and perspectives, and the ability to critically examine your own opinions, views and biases, all massively improves your chances of becoming a decent person.

Also super true.  Realistically speaking, though, critically examining your own opinions, views and biases is *really fuckin hard*, and not everyone can do it.

That's where the right religion comes in.  It's not much different than parenting (I imagine, I have no kids).  There's no manual for parenting, but there's a lot of different philosophies, and no one knows which one is right.  And, eventually, all parents get tired of questions and say ""BECAUSE I TOLD YOU TO"".

Some kids grow up and realize that parents don't know it all.  Some never figure it out.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","Banks are the ones financing movies in Hollywood and they don't want to lose money and they're targeting people outside of North America as well and specially with the Asian markets being so hungry for these movies we will constantly see these tested and tried ideas. That's why a lot of films are getting backed by Chinese investors like Wanda group.

Another issue it isn't the fault of Hollywood, people are paying for these sequels and remakes and adaptations on video games and etc.. 

If more people paid to watch original movies then we would get more enjoyable and newer movie ideas. 

If you look at the list of movies that are being made, it's all Disney dominant with comic books such as Marvel behind it and don't get me started on how they're milking star wars.

Another idea that is being thrown onto the movies ; It's classics like ghost busters being replaced with an all female cast, why can't we have an original script with an all female cast that is totally different than their all male cast counterparts? 

Because $ 

Quality of production and acting has gone higher but creativity and story telling has been completely overlooked, we get great actors like Keanu Reeves being typecast into the same character because investors are afraid to do something new and don't want to lose their money. 

The next set of ground breaking movies are coming from outside of Hollywood and it's coming from Europe and Asia. ",1541030405

&gt;*Couple* is easier to quantify than *few*.

Your point being?

&gt;I don't recall arguing about the definition of ""a few"" in previous posts. Where precisely is it suggested that I didn't read it properly?

Your whole argument was that I told OP something they already knew. You stated they knew they should be spending 35 hours a week looking for a job. OP stated they were only spending a few hours a day. Let me guess, now you‚Äôll try and argue that a few hours is 35 hours a week.

&gt;The next quote from you was very predictable.

Yes, because it‚Äôs quite clear to both of us.

&gt;Repeating what I said before, you cannot use anything I posted to you after you wrote ""Ah, as I expected, professional victim.""

Ok, so once a hypothesis is stated you can‚Äôt use supporting evidence as it becomes available?

&gt;but you need to explain all this supposed evidence within the context of medical symptoms.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I was EXACTLY like this at 19. I went to a California state school for a year and dropped out because I could not get myself to focus on any class and had absolutely no motivation what so ever, even though I wanted to succeed. I tried two different community colleges over the course of 3 years, but ended up dropping each after the first semester. I never knew my issue was ADHD until very very recently, and I'm sure if I had gotten the help I needed I could potentially have graduated with a degree. I'm now 26 and am just finishing up a 1 year intensive program on UI/UX Design, with hopes of finding a job soon. I am still waiting on a diagnoses and am not on medication, but I plan on taking it if I get the diagnoses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just know you are not at all alone, and you should never feel guilty because of your ADHD. I've lived my entire life feeling guilty for how I am, and am just now getting to a better place mentally. Please please try and get the help from a psychiatrist! I'm so bummed I didn't understand ADD/ADHD back when I was in school, if I had I feel like things could have turned out much differently for me. ",1541030410

I lived in the Mission Bay and the Tenderloin in SF, San Mateo, Sausalito and the Presidio. By all means, most of the places I've lived would be considered great places to live by people who like city or suburban living. I felt trapped. Too many people around, no space for my side projects (I like to build things in my spare time). 

Now that I think about it, I'm probably not representative of most people. I'm a true introvert who needs his solitude. From what I understand, that's fairly rare. Most people like being around other people all the time. The more people the better.

Another factor at work here is I grew up in a small community with a lot of relatives nearby. For whatever reason, my quality of life always seems to be better when I'm living near that community and my family, even when it makes it more difficult to make a living.",1541030411

It's fairly typically with new hires into the government, and allows people to start while the lengthy clearance process continues. I've seen people on an interim clearance for 6 to 12 months depending on if it's secret or TS. It comes with restrictions regarding what material you can handle, but most offices would rather you start and learn in the intervening months. 

Based on what you said my guess is the office rarely handles classified material, and the clearance is just a standard practice for all employees.

Driving down I-5 about an hour or so from Sacramento when my family's car gets a flat tire. Sort of the middle of nowhere.

We start walking when all of a sudden, this truck comes toward us off this frontage road next to the freeway. Can't remember what he exactly said at first, but I do remember after asking us whether we needed help, he said ""Do you trust me?"" Sounds terrible out-of-context, but we did. He drove back and helped my dad change the flat to the spare my dad conveniently filled up for once right before we went on the trip. Helped out and then drove the opposite way that he was originally going, which threw us all off a little bit.

If your asking what you build against a Sion, if he is ahead BC can be good to counter his tankyness, if he goes damage for some reason rush DMP instead, but when playing Garen you have more kill pressure and movement speed. How I would build against Sion is phase rush as rune because slow resis is good, bami (don't get if you don't have phase), swifties, DMP, BC, steraks. You can adjust the build to fit your playstyle like grasp, but I rush swifties because his slows are extremely annoying, get unflinching if you can and try and abuse him before first back.",1541030414

If you're worried that people at work are avoiding you or think you're 'weird', you might be projecting that anxiety onto other people when you talk to them, or it could affect your body language. 

Are you sure they were laughing about you? Honestly, whenever I hear two people laughing a distance away from me I STILL jump to conclusions and think that they're laughing at me, even if I know logically they don't even know me.

If these people are acting snotty then I'd say screw em. Act professional and friendly, but don't let it get to you. That kind of behavior is honestly like junior high levels of maturity, but sadly I think a lot of people never grow out of the cliquey way we acted around that age.

Try to be more of an active listener too. People usually love to talk about themselves. If someone mentions they did BLAH over the weekend, or that they're interested in BLAH, ask them a question about it. That might jump start a conversation.

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Then you should expect an uprising filled with young kids that will no longer be fooled very soon, young stud. I felt like no one could fool me, so I struggled to listen to some morons growing up. You might call me troubled. My creator would call me too enlightened to care. 

I could see how gaining wisdom through ""shared"" experiences could lead one to be fooled less, but so what? So could being born wealthy. Or having wealthy internal riches - I was raised very well. It gave me an incredible head start on many old people. Age is still just a number. Our ability to not be fooled was passed down our bloodline. Thankfully, mine is pretty solid. 

If anything, the older you get, the less likely you are to fool me, because most knowledge is all passed down through the bloodline, I believe. As time moves on, our grand parents learned that they were fooled. So did our parents. And so on... Many become irate, and pass on their views to their youth as they vent their frustrations aloud. As more and more people struggle, so will their views of the world around them, and how much it sucks..

Take the police, for example. They can still fool old people. But they can't fool the informed youth with the digital age at their disposal 

Perceive what you will.. 

Oh, and yeah.. I can still easily be fooled. Just not as much as a blind deaf older person. Sometimes even pride will do that to a person.",1541030415

I mean obviously there are inherent limitations to the extent and degree of strength and muscle gain during a cut, but those limitations are probably highly dependent on the specific person so there is no real general guidance other than to get on a program that you can push hard if you can, or back off a bit if your fatigue is building up too much.",1541030416

Since AP1 was officially dropped from support, any current plans for the cars do not apply to AP1 in any scenario and that one blip in Tesla's overall history doesn't negate that overall they do get their shit done. That's all i'm saying. It makes sense AP1 would be dropped too because AP1 is MobileEye cars and they don't work with Tesla anymore. It's an unique circumstance for AP1 cars that makes the fact that AP1 probably not see future updates not count as ""oh look Tesla doesn't deliver on their promises"" in my opinion. If that partnership was still intact, they'd have likely got the updates to that car and things with Tesla in general would be on a quite different track. But that isn't the case.",1541030417

Same as the facebook friends who feel that there's no possible housing for refugees, what with so many veterans already not having housing! Except they never once worried about the homeless veterans before those became a good strawman to deny housing to refugees.


So let's talk about the issue of rape, and let's try to protect potential victims of it. But so long as you want to make it out to be an issue with migrant men, that ignores the actual reality of the issue. To me it then sounds like the issue is not women getting raped, but rather that women are getting raped by brown men instead of men you sympathize with. ",1541030417

"GCdebatesQT","t5_3bm34","Here's an idea I was playing with a while back to answer your question about why an innate gender identity exists from an evolutionary perspective.

Human development depends on a whole host of learned behaviors. Socialization, or the process of acquiring the skills to navigate a culture successfully based on it's rules and roles, is slow. Any genetic advantage boys or girls can have in speeding up the process of socialization will be advantageous to them. I'm thinking of Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell. A key concept in his book was that early advantages that kids have can mean the difference between becoming an NHL hockey player or topping out in pee wee hockey. So, if people(who are stuck in a system of socialization, for better or worse) had some genetic advantage that allowed them to socialize faster than having a pure blank slate, it could be a huge advantage. That's what a gender core could do. It could be like a gender compass that directs kids early on towards certain behaviors and tendencies, effectively causing kids to specialize in the areas that would most benefit them in a gendered culture. Now, would that gender core be something the child or adult would be aware of? No. It would manifest as indistinct from personality. It would be fully embedded in their self structure. However, in the off chance that the gender core was misaligned with their biological sex, suddenly the presence of it would be abundantly obvious. Their inner compass would be pointing in opposition to the gendered socialization that would most benefit them(Again, in a gendered world). In fact, the misalignment would be distressing. It would have the opposite effect of speeding up socialization. It would distort and confuse them at all stages of development, because the inner compass bearing would be pointing in the exact opposite direction than the one that would benefit them. It would cause immense turmoil, until they found a way to align their inner compass with the outer influences.

Just an idea.",1541030417

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, I could mention the airships... but no, I'm going to instead talk about the Sigil Writers. They play an important role in the **Age of Rediscovery** and the **End of Rediscovery/Arrival.**

&amp;#x200B;

**C &amp; K Flying Bar Sigilwriter**

This remarkable piece of magitech is the machine that coined the term sigilwriter and set the standard for what they could do. Capable of receiving approximately 70 different characters and basic commands and a top speed of 50 words per minute, these machines became the favorite of well to do explorers and governments alike. At the height of their use, C &amp; K estimated that one sigilwriter sold every minute. Using a tune-able sigil circuit at the heart of the machine, it allowed a near instantaneous means of communications across Centuria. The flying bar is the system that reads the sigil and sets it for use. The flying bar also gives the machine its distinctive sound.

The only requirement to operate the machine is a suitable electrical power-supply to run the mechanical systems and to excite the sigil.

Various attachments were available for purchase, most notably the paper tape punch and reader. These proved invaluable for record keeping and broadcasting prerecorded messages. (This becomes a plot point during the Age of Rediscovery.) Further, C &amp; K sold a line of these machines, from a basic unit that had no options to a ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô model with all the options. A special version called the Traveller was well suited for use in vehicles and sold well.

However, a quirk of the system was exposed when the human generation ships took up orbit around Centuria prior to landing. The sigilwriters would start up automatically, (if they could, that was an option) print gibberish on the page and behave erratically. The more advanced machines were more prone to erratic behavior, the simpler machines seemed to be somewhat immune, although that did not stop their gibberish text and random line feeds. Turns out, the sigilwriters had somehow picked up on the human ship's radio emissions and were trying to type it out.

Sigilwriters have fallen out of use for normal day to day communications as electronics could do more, were smaller and consumed less power. The sigilwriter lives on in a computer-controlled sigil circuit, allowing secured point to point communications, ironically still using the flying bar method for interacting with the sigil.",1541030418

All those legends, in spite of their differences, had one thing in common. They had a purpose. Whether they fought and struggled like titans, or whether they committed horrible deeds like a demon, they had a purpose. Something that drove them into doing amazing things, in which the world would never forget.

Yet, here I am. A legend you haven't heard of. I have been gifted insurmountable strength and mental prowess that can challenge even the greatest strategists. I have the power of a God, and I could very well become one.

However, I haven't done a single thing with this grand gift of mine. I want to live a normal life. Struggle like a regular person, love like a regular person and hate like one too. While I am greater than a human my desire is a very primitive one. A human one. And it is to become a part of the crowd and let the peace and quite sooth me. 

I‚Äôve heard the legends. I know of the fates they suffered and the deeds they are known for. However, I do not envy them. All I want is a peaceful life and a peaceful end.

By disagreeing with the regents, Hogan is not only opening himself up to criticism, but in a way is directly implicating himself in the process *because he put them in fucking charge.*

Oh, and let me remind you there‚Äôs an election in five days and Larry Hogan is a red governor in a deep, deep blue state.

Things like proofs can require a lot more creativity than the average person expects of math, and the logic can become significantly harder as abstraction increases. A lot of math majors get floored when they hit their upper divisions (abstract algebra, topology, real and complex analysis, first and second order logic). However, at the undergrad level, there is still some planning to help guide students; creativity, while still present, is put in a funnel to common paths. Keep pushing and the challenges will show.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Cut your losses man, chances are it's not yours. You have been dating for 3/4 Months, her sister 6 so they have 2 months of time before you joined, but for him to be hitting on your girlfriend, taking pictures like she is his girlfriend, grinding your girlfriend, sending her DM's asking if they want to fuck. And she is behaving like this while expecting a baby and putting her SO at discomfort defending someone else.

The DM was his, no doubt. You will not be finding any other messages to and from each other like that on socials trust me, better of checking call histories since no more messages will be send directly. Try seeing if she sets up 2nd accounts on socials or starts using snapchat more frequently.

Either way, if you have been in a relationship for 3/4 months with someone, they show this kind of behavior, and she is pregnant for 6 weeks. It's time to get out or talk about everything. And I legit mean everything. Get a counsellor if need be, and you want to give it a last chance. She needs to realize her behavior is putting you to discomfort. Explain everything, not your opinion of them or their actions. Clear communication ""this situation made me feel like... Because... happened, what do you think of ... And how can we ... Change it"" never use personal attacks like ""I think you did... And ... Is bad""

I know it is an ""unpopular"" thing but if things end taking a wrong turn abortion has to be going at least considered. You are both young, together for less then a year, and having a baby. The situation currently is already not healthy. Do not negate toxic and bad situation because of it. A unhealthy relationship between parents will reflect badly on the kid.

Her being pregnant means that you need counseling or at least a lot of proper communication (the one where you don't blame each other but the one that helps each other figure out there point of views and how to compromise) imo being in a relationship means that you can openly share your opinion so they are known to the other so both of you can consider it before handling on situations. It seems like you are getting disregarded and have to deal with that alone.

Also her leaving the hospital could just be that the parents had seen her, summarized what happened and that she would be released soon. And them figuring out that they could continue on with their day. It was a respiratory problem? So no surgeries etc, probably a prescription, doc's report and release probably. But because procedure would take another couple of hours she left in advance knowing she would see her soon enough. Her boyfriend not staying at the hospital is what is actually troubling me more.

He should live with her so for him it should be more important to be with her when she gets released especially since he later went to get a ride for her parents?(or I am remembering it wrong?) Not for his girlfriend? Also why spent the time with someone else instead of waiting for her to be released. And then if going home, why not go to their own place to prepare for the return of his SO etc.

Either way she has in the past said he was behaving bad or weird about you behind your back. Shown dissaprovement to you showing your SO affection. Intimatly danced with her. Posed on pictures that looked more intimate then he was with his actuall SO. Texted your SO requesting sex.

Also a thing I saw in a other relationship advise was on a different subject involving 2 people(an oldest of 3 siblings catching the other 2 being lovers and not sure how to react to it and if she should notify her mother and how), it will require help from someone you trust completely. Single them out when you catch them on a glimp of something. As in request help from a friend to ask your GF her side of the story. While you get the BF of her sister and do the same thing. This makes them unable to communicate about what they are going to say and you will find inconsistency in their stories. Do this on something new and when it is still recently fresh since they will not have had the time to prediscuss or set up a main story. But this is only ofcourse if you seriously suspect them of cheating.",1541030422

*****
&gt; Tech employees tend to be predominantly liberal when it comes to politics; their corporate employers are much more middle-of-the-road. Those are among the findings from an examination of political contributions during this election cycle, using data from Open Secrets, a nonprofit political spending database by the Center for Responsive Politics.

&gt; PayPal&amp;#039;s PAC gave more heavily to conservatives than the other tech companies, donating 62 percent of its $82,000 to Republican candidates.

&gt; Corporate PACs donate the vast majority - 90 percent in the last midterm - of their money to incumbent candidates, who are much more likely to be elected than challengers.

EDIT: I did quickly look at your list after and forgot to mention I did cut all of my taplands for Smoldering Marsh, XLN/DOM Duals, Luxury Suite, Exotic Orchard (new-ish favorite land in EDH) and painlands. So it is a little better than I remember, oops. Also, Shinka's a pretty gross land. No one wants to deal with First Strike and Deathtouch. I am, however, in the process of switching this over from Queen Marchesa to \[\[Mathas, Fiend Seeker\]\], so we'll see what happens there. The core of the deck is WB so I'll probably just switch it over to my \[\[Daxos, the Returned\]\] deck I'm building.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Also, forgot I jammed Xantcha, Sleeper Agent in there as well. Don't remember what I cut.",1541030423

* [Buffalo State English Dept.](https://english.buffalostate.edu/sites/english.buffalostate.edu/files/uploads/Documents/mastersreadinglist.pdf) (PDF)

So it's possible you'll come back to it in grad school, but as an undergrad reading on your own, it's totally fine and normal to explore and find other stuff. Those lists offer starting points--the first one even suggests introductions/overviews, because grad students need those too--and my suggestion is look up a good fistful at your school's library or at the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) and focus on a couple you like.

Incidentally, this sub has had threads in the past where people made up similar lists, e.g. [What would be some of items on an r/AskLiteraryStudies introductory reading list?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/5m1r8c/what_would_be_some_of_items_on_an/) and [Essential literary critics/theorists](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/2914s4/essential_literary_criticstheorists/).

I don't feel like orcs would ever work for Alliance. The only reason the undead would work is because they're just less rotted versions of the same race. There is no equivalent of orcs on the Alliance's side last I checked. Even in WoD there weren't any orc allies. Even back in TBC, I'm pretty sure the Mag'har couldn't be allied by Alliance.

No, if the Alliance were to get something from the Horde it wouldn't be orcs. Nor would it be trolls or undead. Probably not even tauren.

False. To be an immigrant, there needs to be a nation to immigrate to. The Anglo-Protestants who moved here were *settlers*, *pioneers*, and *founders*, not immigrants. The Mayflower was 100% whites. Jamestown, Plymouth, and the nation itself, were all founded by WASPs. To assert otherwise is to ignore historical fact. No white pilgrims, no U.S.A.

You're right, racial demographics have no influence on a nations prosperity. However if the majority population (who also happens to be the founding demographic) wants to maintain that culture they have every right to do so. This is the right of every sovereign people in the world, regardless of race.

&gt; Your racism is so blatant that you literally just said that white people deserve the nations they founded. Think about that.

How is this racist? I believe this is true for all people. Every nation in the world has the right to maintain their ethnic majority. America happens to be majority white. I didn't make it so, that's just reality.",1541030424

So yes, that small percentage is dealt with by malpractice, but the sheer force of the desire of so many people who want to sue would trouble any sane person. And there are hard up lawyers that will take any case.  So good for your dad for letting lawsuits roll off his back - how many times has HE been sued?

Cool. Didn't ask. It's not rape. What part of maybe it isn't fair but it's not rape didn't make sense to you?

"BattleRite","t5_3cpt0","The reason you won't find any LFT threads is because most low elo players, even champion players (previous seasons because this one is still kind of new) do not bother or want to play tournaments because there is no tier 2 tournaments. It is only BPL for Battlerites competitive scene and not even standard Grand Champion players can stand a chance against the BPL teams (writing from experience). Because of this 99% of the low elo players get discouraged and stop trying to become good enough (some even quit the game). The 1% that's stubborn enough to continue the grind I can use myself as an example. Played over 2k hours, GC 4 seasons, peaked rank 3 in soloQ last (mid-late) season. I have not been close to getting into the BPL, maby because I have made a lot of mistakes with teammates I've played with ex. Swapping out Sampha for X (Sampha was a great player).
Who knows if there will even be more seasons of BPL? And its not worth trying to become better than these players for the money because its not near a sustainable income so they will most likely be in the top of the ""food chain"" until they decide to ""retire"" from the game.

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","I was a *huge* fan of ‚ÄúChoose Your Own Adventure‚Äù books when I was a kid.  I‚Äôd read to a point where it would branch two ways, and then use my finger (or a paper clip, or a post-it notepad, or a pen/pencil) to mark that page and then read it to it‚Äôs conclusion and then go back and see how things would have turned out the other way.  [‚ÄúDetroit: Become Human‚Äù](https://youtu.be/8a-EObAhYrg) was literally made for someone like me.  

- It took a while for people to understand that the choices in TellTale games were mostly for flavor (and that everyone would be reaching the same basic conclusion, but they‚Äôd have a few opportunities along the way to make their Lee in ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù feel more identifiable).  ‚ÄúDetroit‚Äù is what everyone actually *wanted* from that kind of game.  It‚Äôs a story about a future where artificial intelligence is extremely common place and trusted to raise your kids, cook your food, take care of the elderly, etc.  But some of those AI are starting to become sentient, and what happens from there is sort of up to you, told through multiple player character perspectives.  What really excited me about it was reading about a couple that played it simultaneously on their own consoles, and by the end of the game they‚Äôd each had a *very* different narrative, conclusion, focus on a specific protagonist, different relationships, etc.  

They released a demo that‚Äôs about 10 minutes long, (with 8~10 different possible conclusions just from that one segment), and you get a flowchart that fills in with the choices you‚Äôve experienced so you can go back and do the different path like I used to with the books.  It‚Äôs entirely possible for main characters to be killed off entirely, and your choices shape the story to be either more human or AI centric.  One of the characters is a hostage negotiator (they send him in because he‚Äôs essentially disposable, and not worth as much as a human life).  So the choices you make for him change how trusted he is by the police force, by the people he talks to, by other AI, etc.  It looks fantastic and manages to scratch my nerd itch by casting Lance Henriksen (who played the android ‚ÄúBishop‚Äù in the ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù franchise).  

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Tl;dr ‚Äî If you‚Äôre into games where you can *actually shape* the story by the choices you make and reach entirely different conclusions, that are well voiced and acted, look fantastic in 4K/HDR, and have replay value where you can go back and see and do the other things, check out ‚ÄúDetroit: Become Human‚Äù.

"Watchexchange","t5_2sqne","Letting go a project I completed over the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's break this down, 

\-skx007 case

\-skx009 dial

\-(unknown source) aftermarket hands with a brushed finish

\-murphy smooth bezel

\-double domed sapphire crystal with blue AR (matches the dial nicely)

\-NH36 (4r36) seiko movement that hacks and wings

\-crystaltimes NH36 crown with the seiko ""s""

\-strapcode super oyster bracelet

&amp;#x200B;

Only thing original to the case is the chapter ring. The case and bracelet is entirely brushed, and the last finish was created with a scrotchpad. The beauty to that, is that you can refinish the entire watch in 15 minutes with a household item. That's exactly what I did prior to this listing, as I have accumulated small scratches from wearing it. The only non-brushed items are the crown and the caseback. The bezel has a deep mark on it, but I use it as a minute marker as the bezel still turns (no clicks). The brush finish is a little rough around the lugs but it's not noticeable. The hour hand lume does not match the dial or minute hand, but I'm including padi hands if you decide to swap. Also the original black chapter ring is misaligned, so while you're changing hands you can align that too. You should also be aware that the day/date change is very slow, starts at 4:30am and ends at 9:30am. That's just the nature of seiko movements. If you were to buy all the parts new and build the same watch, it'd cost over $400. I do not guarantee water resistance, but it's been fine with me under a running faucet. Keeps very good time, almost perfect but your accuracy may vary on how you wear it. I'm also including a 22mm red bruce williams nato ($20 value) that's been worn once.

&amp;#x200B;

Asking **$325 shipped conus**, not looking for trades but always open minded.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

The most comprehensive study on false rape accusations we have found 216 complaints over the time period examined. Of those, only two people actually had charges brought against them.

In contrast, the DOJ lists that out of 1000 rapes that occur, only 310 will be reported to police. Out of those 310, only 6 will go to jail. https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system

So that's about 2% of rapes reported to the police winding up with someone going to jail and 0% of false accusations leading to someone going to jail. Again, I'm sorry about what happened to you.

My husband and I haven‚Äôt had any tests yet, we‚Äôve been trying for about 2 years, which is about the recommended time before seeing a doctor in the UK if you‚Äôre under a certain age. We‚Äôre on the fence about getting tested as we‚Äôve already decided if we can‚Äôt conceive naturally we just won‚Äôt bother having kids, and will probably foster when we are older. Part of me wants to get tested just so I‚Äôm not getting my hopes dashed every period, but part of me also wants to leave it, because I‚Äôd rather have dashed hopes every month than no hope at all.

I‚Äôm sure you know what I mean when I say it‚Äôs so frustrating not to be able to do something purposefully that happens to other people by accident all the time.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Whose job.

The clerk of a committee sends a summons but ultimately the House of Commons (as a whole) is responsible for penalizing those who fail to respond. The House has the power to find an individual in contempt of parliament and impose any remedy or sentence they see fit (including the power to seize and imprison people). There is technically no limit to the sentence they can impose (there's even an unanswered constitutional question about whether or not things like section 7 protections apply), except that parliamentary privilege only exists as long as a particular session, so if there's a prorogation or a writ, a person held in contempt would have to be released.

&gt; That why you're former, though ?

No, I worked there a decade ago. Like the vast majority of political staffers, I put in a couple years fresh out of undergrad and then went on to other things. I would tell anyone who's interested in working in politics: don't be a lifer. Put in a couple of years when you're young to learn the ropes, then go have a career and make some money, and come back in mid-life when you want to work for someone that you really believe in.",1541030436

"FloridaGators","t5_2qv2r","Once when I was a boy my dad was taking me to a game in the Swamp, I can‚Äôt remember who we were playing but I remember riding up to the game and seeing all the people parked at houses and all the people decked out in Blue and Orange walking to the games and I asked my dad why they were walking so far. He looked up in the rear view mirror, I was in the backseat, and he said ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre going someplace special.‚Äù I grinned, looked down and refocused my eyes on the people walking down the street. 

After we had parked and walked to the stadium my dad took me over to the statues, there were only two at the time,  and told me all about Danny Wuerffel and Steve Spurrier. He told me that Steve Spurrier was the coach at Florida long after he played there and actually coached Danny. The next thing that stands out in my mind was sitting in my seats and this massive alligator costume coming over to high 5 me, that‚Äôs when my dad explained to me who Albert was. We sat in one of the corners, I assume it was the one near the band because the songs seemed really loud, loud to the point where it was hard to hear what my dad was saying. 

That was my first experience in the Swamp, I asked my dad about it no too long ago and he didn‚Äôt remember who we played that day either but he remembers taking me to the statues and telling me about Steve and Danny. 

There are two important things to know about this story; the first is that a persons first time in the Swamp is a very memorable experience. The second thing is not a single word of it is true, but I‚Äôd still love to go to the game! ",1541030436

"college","t5_2qh3z","About you last point, for Greek life the base dues (what a member pays who doesn‚Äôt live in) just pay for things like event registration for fun events (respective parents weekends and their activities, dances etc)  t shirts for events, room reservations if they have to reserve spaces, supplies for philanthropy events, if non live in members get meals in the house it pays for those extra meals and things like that as well as some maintenance to the house, since every member can come to the house to study or hang out. And there‚Äôs also insurance costs if there‚Äôs a house involved. Also the national organization takes a certain amount of money every year to run it, as well as give scholarships and aid  to members and chapters (Greek organization or not, most if not all organizations in a campus  that are nationally backed by the national headquarters will do this) as well as make contributions to their respective philanthropies. Also both Greek and Nationally backed organizations have charters (documents that allow them to be officially recognized as XYZ) that sometimes go up for renewal and need to be maintained. Live in members pay those fees + extra to live in the house for the year. Not every Greek organization have houses though, some because of school or organization rules against it, some because of the cost it entails and how parts of the cost are passed to members, so costs for dues for that are a ton lower.

I do agree with this, though.

Shadow went from least played faction to most played faction in under two weeks, with the introduction of a single card.

For example, you mentioned the co-sleeping, and she might want to do so because she planned to do it with her own baby she lost. I don't doubt that she'll jump in later with other things she wants to do with your son when he's a bit older (feeding him solids or formula is a big one, way to undermine you as mom if you breastfeed/EBF). All those baby's firsts she mentioned, well it's her way of replacing the baby boy she lost.

I work from home and use various Linux VM's and the Windows box to do development (main work happens on a Mac). For that reason I have VM's that utilize almost all CPU's (but only using one at a time for obvious reasons).

This replaces, for example, running a Docker on the mac which is outright sluggish. I opted for a physical box for the Windows instance since I suddenly had one available and because I equally suddenly got really horrible performance on the Proxmox VM I used before. 

It's odd - although it was never fast, it was at least usable. It turned into barely-able-to-boot. Not sure why, and didn't want to troubleshoot it. 6/12 cores of L5640 is sufficient for my needs.

Other than that I run Plex, unifi (got a switch and a couple of AP's elsewhere) and unms, apt mirroring, observium (recently set up and testing LibreNMS as well), FreeIPA server.

"RivalsOfAether","t5_32h5b","Month old post, but it's interesting so I wanted to reply anyways. 

One thing that I think makes a big difference is the *feel* of the input of the input (it's timing and how much in game feedback it has). 

Slap City's dash-canceling is probably the clearest example of this (though I'd argue hitfalling *feels* even better). It technically has most of the potential issues of L-canceling (you almost always want to do it when landing with an aerial, it makes the game feel slower for those when you don't use it, and it puts the ability to be competitive behind an extra input barrier to a degree), but because those issues are reduced so much, and because it feels satisfying people enjoy it as a mechanic.

It also has the benefit of having a choice inherent to it (left or right), even if whether you should to use it or not is rarely a decision. This is something I'd argue hitfalling also benefits from, though more subtly. 

Even if whether or not to hitfall an aerial becomes less of a question as you become more proficient, being able to hitfall at all still opens up gameplay possibilities. What you do after that aerial and whether you would've even wanted to use it in the first place change significantly with hitfalling around.

So yeah, I don't think L-canceling and hitfalling (or Slap City dash-cancelling) are comparable, even if deciding whether or not to use them in a competitive setting is similarly inert.",1541030444

**Background checks**: ""nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill"" 

**Assault weapons restrictions (which usually includes the AR 15, a weapon closely related to the M16 -- though I don't know if Beto has specified)**: ""Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those ‚Äúin common use at the time.‚Äù 307 U.

I generally do recommend it to people, because most of the time there are no real drawbacks. But the benefits are so small, that if it's inconvenient or messes with other more important parts of lifting/training, then you're better off dropping it. You're not even going to notice it.

For work reasons we had to move out of the city and came to another, before that she had a talk with me telling me that I was a good person (father to my kids and a good mate for her daughter), eventhough I didn't believe in god.

The difference may be that your roomie is drunk and my mother in law doesn't drink at all hehe, have some patience or move out to",1541030449

*****
&gt; With iOS 12.1, Apple has brought its controversial &amp;quot;Performance management feature&amp;quot; to the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone X. This functionality dynamically throttles the phone&amp;#039;s processor as its battery degrades over time to stop the handset from randomly shutting down - it can be turned off if desired.

&gt; Users can see if the performance management feature that dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns is on and can choose to turn it off This feature applies to iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus.

&gt; Starting with iOS 12.1, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X include this feature, but performance management may be less noticeable due to their more advanced hardware and software design.

The truth is that there is no minor key without the raised 7th, because there is no way to tonicize the minor i. All you have then is an aeolian mode, which lacks the more strict functional definitions used to create tonal harmonic progressions.  ",1541030451

*****
&gt; With iOS 12.1, Apple has brought its controversial &amp;quot;Performance management feature&amp;quot; to the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone X. This functionality dynamically throttles the phone&amp;#039;s processor as its battery degrades over time to stop the handset from randomly shutting down - it can be turned off if desired.

&gt; Users can see if the performance management feature that dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns is on and can choose to turn it off This feature applies to iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus.

&gt; Starting with iOS 12.1, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X include this feature, but performance management may be less noticeable due to their more advanced hardware and software design.

It‚Äôs honestly the most nerdy shit in the world for COD to get elitist about being good at the game for smashing bad players. So yes, in a casual game with a 90-95% casual player base there should be things to help people against the top players. If they took away all the counter measures the cod servers would have a few thousand people on at most and they‚Äôd all be sweatily try harding to maintain a positive kd because the casual player base would migrate to more casual games and they would be playing against the same sort of players they are.

Sure. In that hypothetical, I agree.



Side note: that is actually a practice in pretty much all Islamic theocracies. They oppress and give extra taxes to the other Abrahamic religions, but they don't kill them. It's called the Dhimmi.

They reserve the killing for other branches of non-believers.


&gt;You don't need to have a constitutional right to something for the government denying it based on your religion to be a violation of your 1st amendment rights.

But you do need to have 1st amendment rights to begin with. And that's the debate here. Do we apply that standard to foreign nationals, on foreign soil, asking to come here.

But that doesn't change the fact the when a trend in style is started by a good or decent (at least pro) photographer it's based on the visual literacy of that style. Take the current minimalist movement. I like the images, hate the fact I see them twenty times a day and winning awards... Because, shit, doing something else already!

When I was in highschool/college, I would always experience severe anxiety during my time at home during the summer. In 2010, between my freshman and sophomore years, the longer time between semesters caused it to hit with a vengeance. Normally, it would have burned itself out in about half a month or so anyway. Thanks to the Internet, though, I discovered a handful of websites that instead fed fuel into it, so instead of lasting a few weeks. So instead of a few weeks, it lasted an entire year, with lingering issues going until late 2013. I had to go to a different major because I couldn't deal with continuing to study medicine. I lost a lot of the friendships that I had at the time, because I had extreme difficulty trying to maintain them. I was able to fix some of the damage that did, but honestly, my life is probably never going to be genuinely alright again.

I really feel your pain. We are kind of similar in a way. Like you, I‚Äôm super easy. I‚Äôve put it down to being a super visual person. So when I see boobs, nipples, strong thighs in bed, I‚Äôm 3/4 of the way there. So as a result you could just blow air on my... once and I‚Äôd be toe curling. Not trying to be crass, it‚Äôs just a terrible truth.

Whereas my partner seems to be more sophisticated. So yeah for the longest time I though there was something wrong with  me. Like I would never be able to give her what she gives me in bed and that felt awful.

I think, I eventually understood her when I stopped aiming for the big O. I would just take my time and try different things on my own with her. Like yes before she would try to guide me but then I would shush her with a ‚Äúdo you mind, I‚Äôm busy‚Äù. Let me find out about you instead of you telling me what you think you know... Do you see what I mean by that?

And I think something worked there for me. Because she seemed to get there even when I didn‚Äôt want her to.

I think 18 months, with, what it seems little play time, is not enough to find out about both of your bodies. It took me ages to get the hang of it and even now I know I still have lots to find out about her. 

I think a little patience and just understanding that you are different in how you feel physically and accepting it might help. Talk about what turns you on/off. More time in the bedroom too if you can üòä

"de","t5_22i0","Hast zu viele Vorlesungen/Seminare gew√§hlt? Hab vielleicht ~20 Seiten DinA4 normal bedruckte Seiten pro Veranstaltung, ist nicht wirklich untypisch. Wird einfacher, wenn es an das vorher gelesene/besprochene ankn√ºpft, man weniger nachrecherchieren muss usw. Wenn es wirklich zu viele Veranstaltungen sind, am besten lieber fr√ºh abspringen und dich entschuldigen, du h√§ttest dich aber √ºbernommen, was das Pensum angeht. 

Ich pers√∂nlich markiere i.d.R. beim Lesen, notiere aber sp√§ter. Beim Notieren liest man dann halt nochmal relativ viel nochmal. Hat f√ºr mich den Vorteil, dass ich den Lesefluss nicht st√§ndig unterbrechen muss, bei was Unklarem z.B. ein ? danebensetze und sich die Antwort am Ende vielleicht er√ºbrigt hat. Das k√ºrzt die Notizen ab, ist aber wahrscheinlich nicht wirklich stark zeitsparend, weil man ja doch zweimal liest, wenn auch nicht ganz vollst√§ndig. 

Solltest wahrscheinlich auch Lesetipps aus der Uni bekommen haben? Also, welche Fragen man sich bzw. ""an den Text"" stellt usw. - Hast du sowas nicht bekommen? Ist jetzt √§hnlich wie mein pers√∂nlicher Tipp kein Zeitsparer, aber spart Frustration, wenn man was gelesen hat und am Ende nichts verstanden hat. Wenn du ""um das weg zu haben"" nicht gr√ºndlich liest, wird dich das eher zu Grunde richten, dass dir das Lesen sinnlos vorkommt. Wenn du da nichts bekommen hast, erfrag es am besten von den Dozenten. Das kann auch mal eine Eigenart haben, wobei das eher un√ºblich ist. Wir haben meist auch Lesekompetenz-Sachen aush√§ngen. Tipps, Materialien, sogar ""Schl√ºsselkompetenz""-Seminare oder sowas. Nehme das nur am Rande wahr, aber vielleicht genau das, was du mal anschauen solltest. Wenn deine Uni sowas nicht hat, schie√ü mir mal in die PNs und ich schaue, was unsere da anbietet.

Was ansonsten praktische Tipps angeht, kein Plan. Ablenkungen sind das gr√∂√üte Ding, wenn nicht das einzige. Musst da eher selber wissen, was du dir da zur Lesezeit 'verbieten' musst. Ruhe solltest du schon haben, 'auch seelische', will ich hier sagen, ist aber irgendwie seltsam. Dauergestresst analytisch und mit Lernlust zu lesen ist aber halt doch fast ein Ding der Unm√∂glichkeit. Wenns nicht geht, wegen lauter Mitbewohner oder sonstigem - dann halt direkt in der Uni bleiben und in der Bib lesen. 

Wenns dir ein Trost ist, du bist da nicht allein und wirst merken, dass ein gro√üer Teil an Kommilitonen sich dar√ºber auslassen wird, dass man 5 Stunden die Woche mit lesen zubringt und eine Pflichtveranstaltung um 8 Uhr hat und das unzumutbar sei. Wenn du das nach bestem Gewissen machst und dich nicht tats√§chlich krass √ºbernommen hast, wirst du da nicht h√§ngen bleiben. Wenn du es gr√ºndlich beibehalten kannst, wirst du vor allem in der Vorbereitung f√ºr Hausarbeiten die Erleichterung sp√ºren. Kannst dir das als Lohn f√ºr deine M√ºhen vor die Nase halten.

"metalgearsolid","t5_2s4hr","&gt;Quiet as a boss fight is a joke, you can win the fight just staying behind the first initial cover and using a sniper rifle. You don't need to make an strategy, just bait her attack, then fire. Just waiting for your turn.

You can also beat Ocelot in MGS1 by chasing him in a square and shooting him for 50 seconds. Or beat The End by just sniping him when he's at the docks.  Both are the most efficient strategies and aren't very rewarding or fun.  

These games are inherently broken when it comes to balance, with one clear cut strategy over all.  But that doesn't make the fight bad if there's fun to be had.  Just because you have one optimal method to beat her doesn't mean you have to use that method.  And ideally, one would choose whichever method made the fight more enjoyable.  

&gt;Which brings me to open world games design: more isn't necesarily better; on the contrary, restrictions usually make a game better.

Strong level design makes something better or worse.  Linearity vs open world has nothing to do with it. And the problem with the linear MGS games is most of the level design is bare basic.  They're often designed with minimal guard presence, minimal structural cover and very seldom do you have multiple paths from A to B.

With V, on the other hand, every outpost is optimized for the Zero trace player, with multiple ways to get in and out undetected, and best yet, without needing to engage against the enemies, which is what good level design in a stealth action game is supposed to do.",1541030459

Couple of things. 

  
\- Network and then do some more networking.   
get into a streamer support discord (not the sh!t F4F and H4H rubbish ones a good one), go into other streamers channels with smaller viewer counts and chat with them &amp; organise games (half the streamers in my discord were from this). 

\- Social media, this is super powerful. make sure you let friends, family, work friends, the neighborhoodcat , let everyone know your streaming! Create a FB, twitter &amp; insta account in your twitch name (dont expect a heap of follows it just another medium to get your name into the world), also great for thanking people who follow, host, raid etc. (a little social thankyou goes a long way!)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Re-watch your VODs after every stream (atleats big chunks of it). Check for audio issues, how does it sound? to loud? to quiet? hows the quality of the stream? Using twitch analytics you can see when people dropped off, why so? did something happen on stream?

\- And ultimately, what are you streaming for? for fun? for viewers? if you're new to this i would imagine the first option. Streaming is not ""easy"" per say. Anyone can play games on a camera, the question is is it entertaining to watch?   


 Link me your twitch and i'd be happy to check out your VODS :)

Good point! To further your point with our analogy. The campus police also could not force you to be a student simply because you were visiting the campus. Because they do not have jurisdiction over you as a student from another college and you were simply visiting a friend. Just the legal jurisdiction of whether or not you are allowed to stay on campus once they interact with you.

If not, my guess is that it has something to do with the aspect ratio of the G6. From the V10 to G6 it goes from 16:9 to 18:9, have you tried adjusting per-app settings to try and run the video preview app at 16:9?

My 2nd guess is that you were running a different OS version on the V10, where newer Android versions have loads of power management changes. Try disabling battery optimization for that app.

&amp;#x200B;

If none of these work, is using a wired connection to the camera an option? If the remote live view uses bluetooth, the V10 and G6 are probably running different bluetooth codecs which can be adjusted in Developer Settings.",1541030461

"fo76","t5_jrw25","I mentioned the lore because you are so blinded by being a bethesda drone that you‚Äôll defend anything they do even when it‚Äôs a large mistake, I bet you even defend the dialogue system in Fallout 4 as well.

if you read what I put that‚Äôs literally only your argument, because it‚Äôs a Fallout 4 hybrid, but it never even had the repair system in place anyway. So as I said before what beneficial is using junk that could be used to build weapons, armor and build your camp to repair your weapons, in an thing that was fine since 10 years ago.

The building mechanics in Fallout 4 is awful and has way to many limitations. Your player movement is very limited so there may be places you can‚Äôt get too when building, and if you are on a high place and fall then that‚Äôs all your progress gone. Parts don‚Äôt snap together properly, it will snap to other objects that you don‚Äôt want and it may take you time to actually get it to snap to the object you want or maybe the building part won‚Äôt even snap with the other part at all and you will have to rebuild so it will finally snap together. You can‚Äôt line stuff up or clip them into each, for example; junk fences, in the world you will see junk fences all nicely lined up, however when you do it it‚Äôll have gaps and this can only be sorted with the carpet glitch that was patched. This is mostly at the settlements in general, but in my vault no one is doing anything and will just stand in the corridor for no reason. The max size of building is also a frustration, however reasonable as this games frame rate is awful so that‚Äôs kind of a minor thing. ",1541030461

"MMORPG","t5_2qlxw","So you basically want an action combat mmorpg?

I can recommend you some.

BDO: Looks good, has good combat, mostly PVP and not PVE oriented, sadly heavily P2W unless you like to waste your countless of hours on grinding it.

Tera: Combat is good, world design is one of the better ones, slightly P2W but your skills matter a lot here. You'll get destroyed in in 3* raids and up if you suck. Also has one of the most rewarding tanking experience I've ever gotten in a  mmo. However there is little else to do than raiding since pvp is dead and the crafting/gathering system sucks. Also is badly optimized so expect random framedrops and freezes.

GW2: Turn on the action camera and play the game like that, still tab target since the action cam is just auto tab target whatever you're aiming at. Not everyone's cup of tea but it's f2p, so just try it out. Also one of the more casual friendly and just do whatever the hell you want mmorpg.

Vindictus: Best action combat mmorpg I've played, sadly it looks dated due to it being a Source Engine game. It is very poorly optimized. Hub based game. Also p2w at the end game.

PSO2: F2p, not p2w at all, best character customization I've ever experienced, good action combat, runs on literal toaster pc's but can look good if you use some enb's.

DFO: One of the only remaining pixel side scrolling beat them up mmorpgs left. The combat is good, however the end game is basically a huge grind. Also has fatigue point system which is a con. Not sure if it's p2w or not since I haven't played since 2009. But it had some elements in it.

Blade and Soul:  Good combat, however the gearing is p2w unless you like to grind your life away. Suffers from bad optimization, which can be partly but not entirely fixed by using BnS buddy.",1541030461

Is it? Did you spend your early years partaking in ""not-Bible"" study? Did you, or do you currently, attend weekly ""There's no God"" gatherings with fellow atheists to talk about why there's no God, what you can learn from that, and then socialize with these same people many of whom you've known for decades? Because I highly doubt that being an atheist is as integral to who *you* are as being religious is to the people who would be offended by getting a ""God isn't real"" pamphlet.

You said that there are some classes ""that I never really understand."" It's supposed to be like that, unfortunately.

That's why I believe we should get rid of unrelated gen ed and liberal arts classes while amplifying the rigor of the core classes to truly understand the details. But this is a really a controversial topic, and I digress.

Don't buy into the ""college is supposed to be the best four years of your life"" type of bullshit. The people who say that are the ones who wasted their educations by partying and drinking and then later struggled to find jobs. I also barely have any friends, never had sex, am on antidepressants, my GPA sucks, I feel huge embarrassment when I hand in reports that are half-baked, and I think the last time I interacted with a female that was not a store cashier was in April.

You should understand that while the creator of the documentary, 'Problem with Apu,' is not offended by the character, rather, he is annoyed with the ways in which this single Indian-American cultural production can potentially alter how people reflect upon that culture. Unfortunately the same can be said for the black community (to which you claimed yourself to be), however, there are many instances in popular-culture, specifically film, where the black community is presented in the light of power, bravery, etc., because people have worked to create cultural products through art to change people's perception towards that community (for example, the films ""A Raisin in the Sun"" 'The princess and the frog' come to mind). I suppose the same must be done for other minority cultures, but the discussion here is to gain a better understanding as to how American pop-TV influences its audiences and their understanding of other cultures.

"gwent","t5_384zi","&gt;i would like to know your opinion about Xavier and White frost

I outlined it further below in another comment (and in loads of threads on reddit). Here some general thoughts from me (afterwards my answer to your suggestions):

* I do believe Xavier and White Frost to be ""silver bullets"".  Even more since both cards apply to bronze and gold cards alike. Silver bullets are not only bad for one playstyle but in general for a lot more, which the designers didnt see at first.
* Xavier disables a lot of decks, leaders and cards. Examples:  any Francesca deck (can be played around but still an issue) as well as  any deck relying on Renew, Caretaker, Necromancy, Eist Tuirseach,  Phoenix, Ciri: Nova, Ghoul, Ruehin, Sygdryfa, Mourntart, Ozzrel, Assire,  Gudmund, Princess Pavetta, Antidote, Eibhear, any relic and trap  deck,...
* White Frost can disable any amount of artifacts with one card. So instead of balance, it breaks all artifact control decks at once. But there is more: NR direly needs e.g. Petris Filter for some combos to really work. And NR is already weak enough - widespread White Frost usage would hit NR as well. The list goes on...

Bottom line: Xavier and White Frost are too general, silver bullets, which make the game more binary and less complex.

&amp;#x200B;

To answer your questions:

&gt;it's the effect that you don't like?

The effects are too general. There should be at least a limit to ""bronze cards only"". Considering the cost of Xavier and White Frost it should be either banish 2 (or 3) bronze cards or 1 gold card. A short look at provision cost tells us that Xavier shouldnt banish 10+ gold and bronze cards. Similar to White Frost: the provision cost shouldnt allow to remove e.g. 5 bronze artifacts and 2 gold artifacts. The provision cost vs benefit ratio is totally out of whack for either card.

Apart from that only ST is able to ""defend"" against white frost (but no other artifact including trap removal) with sheer luck: Serpents Pit. And only Francesca might be able to reliably defend her artifacts against white frost but not against targeted artifact destruction.

&gt;just the way it works (deploy = fire and forget)

I believe the way it works directly corresponds to provision cost, while the effect of neither card is imho acceptable.

&gt;To be more clear what if white frost would be permanent for an entire  round (like RnR) and prevents artifacts to be played (and i think it  will be cool if it will expand from 1 row to the entire board...you  know, lore xD)

This would need a different provision cost and tbh your example is imho too weak for a gold card. Maybe make ""disable bronze artifact"" for 4 rounds a bronze weather effect instead, where you can apply ""clear row"" to clear the weather? Whereas White Frost might be a 2 row effect to stop all artifacts for 2 rounds? Now add some row requirement to artifact placement... A whole new set of strategies, which can be finetuned and balanced without a silver bullet...

&gt;And about Xavier (**warning! TB spoilers**) what if:  
&gt;  
&gt;he is played as a spy and after 2 turn he banish the graveyard based on the row

He wont survive 2 turns... never. And the issue with provision cost and the general effect still applies...

&gt;or it's the effect that shouldn't exist at first?

I feel the effect being too general for both cards.

&gt;Thank you for your time :)

She is very forgiving, repeatedly expresses how sorry she is about how **he** was treated by the media and is very, defensive of him. Look up her AMAs on this site.

While the media surely did try to exploit both these situations, I feel a stronger undercurrent of both women trying to protect their attackers in a very Stockholm Syndrome way. Polanski is still alive (and free) so this type of rhetoric can be harmful. Priklopil is not but this does come across as an attempt to protect his ""honor"". That he is not *that* bad. Saying that you're not a victim simply puts a stop to anyone criticizing the attacker. How could he victimize someone if the woman herself doesn't consider it as such?

So yeah, while there is a lot to say about how the media reacted, stuff like this seems to be more focused on protecting the attacker coming from people with Stockholm syndrome.

Waaaaay far back, the progression was gutter runner -&gt; night runner -&gt; assassin. It made sense - the rats in the gutter who survived progressed to night runners. It also just sounds better. ""Night Runner"" sounds like the top tier, while your Assassins are the best of the best.

Somewhere around 4th edition Warhammer after Skaven became more pronounced, these two terms got switched. Gutter Runners became the 'elite' troops and the night runners became the core/less experienced troops, and that's *weird*.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","TL;DR:

\#1: voted in 2016 and doesn‚Äôt vote anymore in case they lose, also is a purist

\#2: changes his opinions a lot so he‚Äôs never sure of anything, ever

\#3: thinks it‚Äôs not exciting enough to vote, then thinks it‚Äôs unfair when people tell him that‚Äôs irresponsible

\#4: moves around a lot and has to re-register every time, always forgets to

\#5: thinks the Democratic Party doesn‚Äôt represent her views, proceeds to not explain what her views are, also is a purist

\#6: didn‚Äôt know anything about politics, did some research, formed her own independent opinions, realized voting was important, and decided it wasn‚Äôt worth her time and energy and didn‚Äôt register. Plans to vote in 2020 but apparently doesn‚Äôt know what the midterms are.

\#7: Thinks everything is just political theater, like when Bernie told people to vote for a slightly less progressive candidate over a fascist paleocon, also is a purist. 

\#8: doesn‚Äôt know how to use the post office or how to ask the people at the post office how to use the post office or how to Google how to use the post office

\#9: thinks exciting politicians are going to instantly change everything, is disappointed when life just kinda carries on. Thinks an election can‚Äôt be important because ‚ÄúI Voted‚Äù stickers don‚Äôt feel like a revolution, also is a purist.

\#10: doesn‚Äôt have the necessary documentation to register online, has a chronic illness that makes it hard to go register in person. **Has the only reasonable excuse in this whole article.**

\#11: Thinks politics is evil, also can‚Äôt be bothered to vote. Cares a lot about women‚Äôs rights, but not enough to vote for them.

\#12: doesn‚Äôt know what to vote for, gets information leaflets in the mail but doesn‚Äôt read them because they‚Äôre not online (I‚Äôm not exaggerating, read the article). Thinks all political information should be conveyed over Instagram or Snapchat. (Again, not exaggerating. That‚Äôs literally what he says.)",1541030468

I went through my worst bout of depression when he was off at his new job making good impressions but little did they know he was gaslighting me every chance he got. He use to use me as the joke punchline too. Eventually the gaslighting turned into he randomly kicking me out. He lived a double life, I found out after I left. He lived his work life like he was single but use to control what I did. So many times he would tell my dad we broke up, then a week later, we‚Äôd be ‚Äúback together‚Äù without ever telling me.

You do realize that the electorate is far larger than just LA county (10 mil) and NYC metro (30 million) areas right? And those are raw population numbers which include those ineligible to vote.

Simply removing the electoral college does not transform our country into a democracy, as representatives (not the president whose only election is affected by the EC) are elected and still generate legislation.

I never said ""middle America"" is a worthless crap hole. It, like urban America (which also includes middle america urban areas), serves its function in society and should get a voice in the government, hence their vote counts for the same weight as urban people in the presidential election and they still receive representatives that generate legislation to address their needs and concerns.

Right now most presidential candidates only address and campaign in swing states where it can flip red or blue.

[Dolby Atmos Cinema Authoring Suite Manual](https://www.dolby.com/uploadedFiles/Assets/US/Doc/Professional/Authoring_for_Dolby_Atmos_Cinema_Sound_Manual(1).pdf)

This is literally the manual for authoring Atmos tracks in ProTools that professional mixers use.  From the bottom of the second page:

&gt;**1.1 Dolby Atmos Overview**   
&gt;  
&gt;A Dolby Atmos mix consists of three primary elements:   
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¢ **Bed audio** (or bed material): **Channel-based** premixes or stems (including their multichannel panning)   
‚Ä¢ **Object audio** (or objects): Mono or stereo soundtrack content that have dedicated panning (via Dolby Atmos metadata)   
‚Ä¢ Dolby Atmos metadata: Panner automation for objects, plus additional metadata  

Below that is a simple ""Dolby Atmos Block Diagram"" which shows ""Bed Audio + Object Audio + Metadata = Dolby Atmos"".

This document is littered with dozens (if not hundreds) of references do the distinction between bed/channel content and object content (and notice no mention of upmixing in the entire document).

&amp;#x200B;

And here's a powerpoint from Dolby describing Atmos at a high level: [http://www.aesmelbourne.org.au/wp-content/media/Dolby\_Dec2017.pdf](http://www.aesmelbourne.org.au/wp-content/media/Dolby_Dec2017.pdf)

Look at Slide 20 where the literal title of the slide is ""Hybrid Channel-based + Object-based Audio"" -- the VERY FIRST FUCKING THING that I said at the top of this discussion was that Atmos is actually a ""hybrid system"" of channels + objects.  And notice it shows nice pretty pictures labeled again ""Bed + Objects = Dolby Atmos"".

&amp;#x200B;

I could keep on going, but this is getting boring.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to stick to that one diagram of yours and ignore everything else..... knock yourself out.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;  If you're searching for irrefutable evidence, you'll never find it. 

So you agree there's no irrefutable evidence for God's existence or for the Quran being true?

Thanks for your honesty (and I'm inclined to agree) but surely if you're confident God exists, you should expect there to be evidence?

Instead you seem to be saying there is no irrefutable evidence for God, we'll never find any but we should take a leap of faith and believe anyway. I don't find that at all logical.
 
&gt; The concept of vanity doesn't really apply. Vanity is a bad trait in humans because at the end of the day, they aren't substantial. A human can trip on a banana and die. Trying to think of God in human terms is very limiting. 

Anyone, regardless of how accomplished they are or how few mistakes they've made, can be vain and narcissistic. Saying that God is too perfect to be vain/narcissistic strikes me as a special pleading fallacy.

Even if - hypothetically - a being has no flaws/limits, narcissism is itself a flaw. As long as there are other sentient beings in existence it's selfish to have an excessive focus on yourself and expect their thoughts and actions to revolve around you.

&gt; Even presuming God exists and that it's the God described in the Quran, you've given me no reason why he has the moral authority to tell me how to live my life. 

&gt; This is the dumbest and most arrogant thing I've ever read. So presuming God exists, he created you and the entire universe - that doesn't give him moral authority. Lol. 

You've insulted me but you've yet to give me an argument setting out a basis for his moral authority so I'll ask again. What would you base it on?

**His incredible power?**  

You could certainly make an argument that - presuming he exists - God is overwhelmingly powerful, has threatened humanity with punishment if we disobey and therefore we should do what he says out of fear. That kind of ""pascal's wager""/""the weak endure what they suffer what they must"" style argument has nothing to do with morality though.

Just because the strong can impose their will on the weak, it doesn't mean they have a moral right to. Might does not make right. Power comes with the responsibility to use it justly, and there's no reason that shouldn't hold true for ultimate power.

**How about authority from age?**

 Whilst experience often has value, age doesn't always equal wisdom. Hence, moral authority doesn't come from age. 

**The debt we owe to God for our existence? The rights of a creator?**

If we're given/borrow something then we owe a proportionate debt; usually based on either prior consent or a moral desire to repay kindness.
However, creditors don't have unlimited rights and debtors don't have unlimited obligations, and the relationship between creditors and debtors can still be violated by abuse (e.g. by the threats of violence/torture in many major religions). More so, an omnipotent God claiming authority based on debt would strike me as profoundly lacking in generosity.

Consider these examples:

- A bank - no matter the debt owed - has no right to physically harm the debtor.  
- A good parent is responsible for their children's existence and is owed a debt of gratitude for their love/support/protection. Do they demand repayment and absolute obedience from adult children? No, they're more generous/altruistic than that, they want what's best for their children and for their children in turn to pass on that generosity. They want us to grow and think for ourselves. 

I would also argue that creators rights are limited and there are clearly overriding moral priorities.

- If a scientist created a vaccine against malaria, the rights of the creator to refuse to share it are overridden by a moral obligation to make it accessible and address a major cause of suffering in the world
- If a scientist created a truly sentient artificial intelligence which could experience suffering, I would argue they still have no right to abuse it despite being its creator. 

**Omniscience?**

Even with the ability to see the possible consequences of different actions, you still need values to decide which consequences are preferable. An omniscient being could be benevolent, malevolent or something in between. Hence, the characteristic of omniscience tells us nothing about how moral they are. 

**God's morality is based on logic and benevolence?** 

If morality isn't a set of arbitrary rules with a foundation of ""the omnipotent/omniscient creator said so"" then the alternative is that morality is justified based on reasoning and values. 

Logically, with any form of morality based on logic/values rather than on divine decree, God - just like the least of us-  is capable of choosing to be either moral or immoral rather than automatically right.

As a believer, perhaps you'd argue God always makes the moral choice because they're perfectly logical and empathetic and driven by infinite compassionate and altruism etc? 

I find this highly questionable. I would argue that the logical foundations of morality should be empathy, values of compassion and altruism, and applying reasoning to choose consequences that minimise suffering and maximise satisfaction. By those standards, an omnipotent/omniscient God that allows famine, disease, natural disasters and genocide would be immoral, and we can say with certainty those things have occurred in our reality.

More so, the Gods of many major religions - including the God of the Quran - are described committing deliberate mass murder, condoning slavery and prejudice, and sending people to eternal suffering in the afterlife. According to any moral system based on compassion and reasoning those actions are extremely immoral.

Not to mention the Blades were made out to be this bad ass Imperial Intelligence division in Morrowind and then in Oblivion turned out to just be a bunch of incompetent weebs. Cyrodiil is the freaking Capital of Tamriel and I do not think they capitalized on the politics and importance of the region enough in Oblivion.

I didn't succeed because I wanted to make sure I didn't ""leave a message"" (hence less-lethal methods), woke up the next day, and went to class. A campo officer pulled me out of a class that day and drove me to the health center.

I talked to someone there. I went back for a few weeks. I was told there this is a fairly common occurrence, that the counselors there take rotating night watches for this kind of thing. They felt very overwhelmed. 

Not too long after, they changed the policy to shovel everyone into group therapy. I stopped going. I know that policy has been reversed, but it hurt. I regressed and tried to kill myself twice more before graduation.

In the end, the only reason I'm still alive today is my SO. This is not the the fault of the counselors; it's the administration. The counseling program needs more money for more counselors. They need to be able to provide more services and more time slots, at least for stuff like this.

That being said, if you feel even the slightest bit suicidal, GO TO THE HEALTH CENTER. They won't judge you. They'll do whatever they can to help you. They want you to live and so does everyone around you. It took me a very long time to realize it but, it's true. You have more friends than you think. ",1541030474

"Campaigns","t5_2rp9z","So I've become more and more interested in getting involved in politics, especially since I moved to DC, where the atmosphere is thick with it.

I was a PoliSci guy in undergrad, and have a bit of journalism and publishing experience, but it would be fair to call me an early-career lawyer at the moment, with a few years experience, in both government and in the private sector.

With the 2020 campaigns getting ready to kick off, is there any way to get involved early on? Who would I contact? What could I do? I have zero experience with political campaigns, even at the minimal, grassroots level. I was going to volunteer for a congressional candidate during the midterms but his district was a further drive than I thought and he turned out to be a little wackier than I was prepared for, so I let it go.

If that's not realistic, what could I do going forward to explore the field more? Obviously, volunteering to make calls or knock on doors is one thing, but is there anything else? In a presidential campaign, even if the person is a governor from the other side of the country, they would probably need a DC presence right?

Images, screenshots, or gifs uploaded through the Reddit app or the reddit website are not allowed; as such, your post has been removed.  We only allow images as part of a discussion post, or if hosted on a portfolio site; gameplay gifs must be hosted on another website and that link shared to reddit.

## How do I submit images or screenshots?

You may submit your post as a [discussion (self) post](/r/Overwatch/submit?selftext=true) with some context - more than just a single line of text - speaking about the image. If you're submitting fanart, you may link directly to a DeviantArt page, ArtStation portfolio, blog, etc.  

Imgur posts are automatically removed, even if its a GIFV, as we're not able to detect which type it is.

[Zargabaath](#I/Icons/u8059/) [CG Lid](#I/Icons/u886/)[Ayaka](#I/Icons/u651/)[Gladio](#I/Icons/u716/)[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)[CG Hyou](#I/Icons/u1038/)

7‚òÖ Zargabaath  (MP: 950, DEF: 540, SPR: 452)  
6‚òÖ CG Lid  
7‚òÖ Ayaka  (MP: 718, DEF: 256, SPR: 1040)  
6‚òÖ Gladiolus  
7‚òÖ Hyoh  
7‚òÖ Hyoh

Everyone status immune, or close to it. Lakshimi with Charm Resist. Ayaka is fully enhanced (though not fully potted). Everyone except Zarg had 0 MP. Zarg used Rejuvenate+2 on Ayaka, who used Dedication+2 and Lid used her ATK/MAG break on the boss, Gladiolus used Intercept, and Hyoh just did whatever.

The following turns were basically just ayaka casting charm and stone resist (since I had a few gaps in my status immunities because I have 1 Ribbon, 1 CG Fina hat, 1 Anti-Disaster. I need to get some discernments...) and zarg messed around dual casting Rejuvinate+2 and Archadian Light+2, and not attacking on turns 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17. Lid just alternated between Mag Absorb and Atk Absorb for the entire fight.

Eventually I had enough orbs, Zarg dual casted Archadian Crest on both Hyohs, and the Hyoh triple casted Phantom Blade and two Servant of the Blade. Granted he was at 67% hp when I did this, but I think it could have done this at 100% and it still would have evaporated him.",1541030479

Even if Niantic limit us to the max star dust we can get from a gift(300) after opening 20 gifts we'd get 6k stardust, per day. Which is a lot, so Niantic would either lower the amount of star dust you can get from gifts, when our bags are filled to something like 50 which makes it more 'balanced' but would also mean we'd be better of opening all our gifts to try and get star dust from the rng.",1541030480

I'm aware of this. Wall Street is a ponzi scheme fed by war.

&gt;This isn't about borders. This is about scapegoating one group for another and ignoring how right wing forces sell snake oil to divide and conquer.

Yes but the right wing generally wants open borders. I am older and remember when the left was not. I want to stop the flood of undocumented slaves coming into the US AND to stop the wars that create them. 

&gt;Where's the understanding that American corporations upend people in their own homes to have a Race to the Bottom?

And where are those corporations now? What is their position on employees exempt from minimum wage and basically any law?

&gt;Where's the solidarity when Latinos are told to appear in court at age 5 for being illegal? Which is a thing, right now in America.

We need to change the laws. We need to stop government from treating innocent people like shit just for making them work. We can't just be OK with selective enforcement. We are only outraged now because of the corporate media. If the media covered any of a billion active ongoing injustices in this country we would be outraged. Don't let them select what outrages us.

&gt;You're ignoring who the laws are made for and punching down when it will only bite you in the backside.

Do you want socialism? Want democracy? I'd prefer communism without a state, but I think we need democracy at this time. Democracy means laws. We don't need to have laws that punch down (but yes they do right now, almost all of them). The solution to our problem is not to increase the minimum wage while flooding the labor market with undocumented scabs. Trust me, comrade. The oligarchs are playing liberals for fools.",1541030481

I'm not really going to defend the founders much as I don't beleive their intentions 100% selfless, most of them were little more than educated thugs but like you and me not all of them agreed on the finer points of what democracy or even republic looked like, but to claim it was their intent to be the landed gentry of a new nation is a gross twisting of limited historical understanding. As far as why wouldn't have pot been legalized because history is guide. It took people stating their intention to legalize, regulate, and tax a product everyone was already using anyway it didn't just happen because people said ""no, this is dumb, my vote won't be counted."" In fact most the people I knew personally voted for it with the expectation that it would be defeated either by their fellow stupids or by a federal government married to the money laundering scheme known as the drug war. These things are exactly as you say ""treats"" but when the electorate on a day to day behaves like dogs you can hardly blame others for treating them as such, but as I said someplace else it is extremely hard to take away a bone you've given a dog once you've given it to them to chew on for a while.

I'm six weeks post op this week, and i wouldn't say im quite at ""pre-sciatica"" levels physically.  I herniated my disc weighlifting, and i was in so much pain the only real physical activity i could do was walking my dogs :( I feel like I lost most of my muscle definition in my legs which sucks.  For me personally, my weight lifting days are over.  Im too afraid that i'll reherniate.  My doctor said to wait until 6 months post op to start doing any physical activities like i ""normally"" would, but im going to stick with low impact exercise, spin, pilates, stuff like that.  It's not worth it for me to risk reinjuring my back.  I can do almost all of the regular day to day stuff that i couldn't before though, which is great.  It's nice to be able to just ""exist"" comfortably without intense pain.

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","I elaborated on that in a reply I made to /u/greyenlightenment, but the fast version is that I am suspicious that the educational system is running into limits on human intelligence the same way athletic competitions are arguably running into limits on human athleticism. I just don't think our current education system is good enough to be maxing out what is possible in education.

I freely admit that someone with an IQ of 90 cannot learn as much as someone with an IQ of 120, but I bet they could be learning more than they are now.

In your case, you may not beat a talented 12-year old, but you could be doing better than you are -- if improving your time on the 100-meter dash was sufficiently important to you.

While the linked article argues that improving educational outcomes is perhaps not the best thing we could be doing, I think most would agree that it is an important thing for society to do. And I think we *could* be doing better, but we aren't somehow and I'm curious as to why. I'm aware that the data is somewhat contrary to that view (educational outcomes not working is evidence for educational outcomes being unable to work).

I have a Ph.D in chemistry and I'm sensitive to your point that training until you're in your late 20s early 30s is a long time. I don't feel like have maxed out on my own learning; I learn new things about chemistry every day, it seems. And my sense is that the students I interact with under-perform relative to their capabilities and it is often *not* due to limits on their intelligence -- at least, I don't think it is. I think it comes down more to responsibility, conscientiousness, and priorities.

I wholeheartedly agree with the point in your last paragraph, and /u/TracingWoodgrains says something similar in a reply above. Education plays a role both as teaching *but also* as signaling and credentialing and I think those roles frequently get in the way of each other.

EDIT: I suspect there may be some equivocation in the term ""education"" when discussing policy. Since education often does function merely as a credential to unlock higher-earning jobs (regardless of the skills gained), I suspect that when some people say that we need more education in this country what they really are thinking about is those credentials to get access to better jobs, not about knowledge *per se*. When I say that we aren't maxing out educational possibilities, what I mean is that people have not attained as much knowledge or skill as they could. But it may be that, in aggregate, people don't actually *want* more knowledge or skill -- they just want the credential.",1541030485

What they do get is better priced healthcare and vast more vacation and sick days.

At a minimum, I think the latter needs to be adapted here, but take it from someone who has lived in Europe(as a US citizen). Europe is not some post-capitalist paradise. Things are more expensive and people have less income, with some compensatory benefits. In other words, there's some freaking nuance. I mean, Europe's great, but I don't think it's that much better than the US. There are certain things that are better, certain things that are worse. 

Personally, I prefer the US. Mainly because for the same job, I get way, way more disposable income, even including my healthcare expenses and savings per year. I could afford to do lots of fun things here that i couldn't in Europe, they are way stingier with pay. 

And maybe I'd feel differently if I had cancer or some other terrible disease and I had to pay out the ass, but we are ultimately products of our experience, and that is mine. 

I think if healthcare was fixed here, the lack of many weeks of vacation time would be more acceptable. I mean I think hc is a mess regardless.",1541030486

Daniel stood in the command center at parade rest; feet wide, arms tucked behind his back. His face was impassive as he stared into the wallscreen, more specifically the woman presented on it. She wore a Griffon greatcoat like a suit of armor, secured from the hem all the way to her neckline, steel grey hair framing a face set in a serious expression. Senior Commander Helian was one of the G&amp;K bigwigs, some said the right hand of Mr. Krugyer himself. 

‚ÄúOf course ma‚Äôam. We‚Äôll get it done.‚Äù He responded. The Senior Commander accepted this with a curt nod. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll await your report. Additional details will follow shortly. Helian out.‚Äù She said, terminating the connection.

No longer on camera Daniel relaxed, letting his shoulders slouch a bit and leaning back to rest against the chart table behind him. Here, in the nerve center of the outpost, he had drafted operational battle plans, patrol and logistics routes, and ambush doctrines. Now he was being asked to do something completely different‚Ä¶way outside of his wheelhouse.

‚ÄúMossy,‚Äù He said, turning to his adjutant. The quiet, silver-haired T-doll stepped forward.

‚ÄúYes, Commander?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease organize an all-hands this afternoon in the mess.‚Äù Daniel continued.  ‚ÄúAll personnel are required to attend.  Facility defense will be handled by the automated warning systems with dummies from the Perimeter Team in support.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, Commander.‚Äù Mossberg produced a tablet from her side and keyed open the base calendar. ‚ÄúMost personnel are on-site, and free at 1300. I‚Äôll send out a notice for then.‚Äù

A few hours later, Daniel stood in the mess hall before the arrayed T-dolls of his company. Looking out over the crowd of inquisitive faces, he noticed that the dolls had arrayed themselves by squad. Thompson and the elites of First Echelon sat together near the front, flanked by FAL‚Äôs reserve Second and SVD‚Äôs scout-sniper Third echelons. The other reserve and patrol echelons, along with the dedicated logistics and support teams also congregated together. 

Satisfied that everyone was present, he cleared his throat loudly to get the room‚Äôs attention. He spoke without the assistance of a microphone, his deep voice carrying across the hall.

‚ÄúThank you for coming. Now, I‚Äôm sure many of you are wondering why I‚Äôve called you all here. The last time we were all in this room it was the final brief before a major operation, and things have been rather quiet as of late. HQ has our efforts to thank for the newfound stability in the region, and because of that they have seen fit to offer us a new assignment.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn international aid group has partnered with G&amp;K recently to distribute aid to underprivileged zones, due to our global presence in these areas and historical tendencies to bring needed stability to them. While this in itself is nothing new, the type of aid we have been tasked with delivering is‚Ä¶an interesting departure from the norm. We have been tasked with using provided funds to engage with, and improve the morale of the children that call our sector home.‚Äù

Daniel paused to collect his thoughts and the mess hall fell quiet save the hushed whispers between T-dolls. He could see questions in the eyes of everyone present as they processed what they‚Äôd just been told.

‚ÄúSo our next op‚Ä¶‚Äù Thompson spoke up, voicing what was on everyone‚Äôs minds. ‚ÄúIs to make kids happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the long a short of it, yeah.‚Äù He confirmed.

‚ÄúHow are we supposed to do that?‚Äù asked Suomi.

‚ÄúActually, the material sent by the aid group has a bunch of ideas on how to do that.‚Äù Daniel explained. ‚ÄúMost of them are festivals events and sports competitions, but there‚Äôs a suggestion that really struck me to incorporate holidays into the mix. Seeing as October is just rolling around I thought that we might do something Halloween-related. Like a Halloween Fair or something like that. The idea‚Äôs just in its early stages, but I hoped that you girls might have some suggestions to help flesh it out.‚Äù

Excited murmurs raced around the hall as the T-dolls talked amongst themselves.

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a splendid idea, Commander.‚Äù Springfield said from the back of the hall. ‚ÄúWe could do bobbing for apples, and I could whip up some Halloween treats. Spider cupcakes, caramel apples, and the like.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh let‚Äôs get some candy to hand out as well.‚Äù M14 suggested.

‚ÄúAnd chocolate!‚Äù FFC jumped to her feet in her excitement, prompting snickers from the crowd.

‚ÄúYa can‚Äôt trick-er-treat without proper costumes.‚Äù M2 Browning called out, whom even seated towered above most of the other dolls. ‚ÄúDoubt many of the kiddos ‚Äòround here have the means to make em.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs order some.‚Äù This came from Spectre M4. ‚ÄúWe can get a bunch of old clothes and facepaint and stuff and let kids make their own costumes when they get here.‚Äù

More T-dolls offered ideas and suggestions, and the mess hall soon descended into a din of excited discussion. Breathing a sigh of relief Daniel smiled and pulled out his tablet and stylus, jotting down the festival ideas that had been broached so far. He had been worried about the feasibility of his plan, but the T-dolls under his command had jumped at the chance. Helian had been right; they‚Äôd be able to execute this operation after all.


‚ÄúWelcome to the Karma Halloween Fair!‚Äù cried M1911. ‚ÄúEnjoy yourselves and have a Happy Halloween.‚Äù 

The pistol T-doll was clad in a blue-green robe, with her face and hands painted in the same color. She waved an electric lamp fashioned to look like torch as she welcomed crowds at the front gate, directing them to the events inside.

By All Hallows Eve Outpost Karma had undergone a drastic transformation. Cobwebs covered some of the concrete buildings and steel warehouses, while others were decorated with butcher paper murals depicting bedsheet ghosts, black cats, and other spooky fare. A ring of stalls have been erected in the open parade ground in its center, lit by strings of orange lights handing between them. 

Each stall was run by a different echelon, handing out candy to throngs of passing children and hosting other events.  Thompson, clad in a baggy pinstripe suit and chewing a chocolate cigar, directed children with the rest of Echelon One towards an immense pile of clothes, shoes, and hats. G36C and Sten ran a face-painting booth next door, adding monster makeup to complete kid‚Äôs costumes or applying face paint to children that wanted cat whiskers or other designs. All of the company‚Äôs T-dolls had dressed up to some extent and welcomed the kids to their booths with smiles and handfuls of candy.

The most popular booth by far was Springfield‚Äôs. Dressed in purple witch‚Äôs robes and matching hat, she smiled as she worked over a cauldron of gently bubbling caramel dipping in apples on sticks and setting them aside to cool on a table absolutely weighed down with baked sweets and pastries.

Daniel stood to the side and watched the proceedings with a small smile. The Halloween fair preparations had gone over without a hitch as everyone pitched in, but he had been curious if any of the local children would show. He and the dolls under his command had dealt with the people in the area before, but the populace usually kept them at arm‚Äôs length. When he and Mossy had arrived at one village to pass out flyers they had been met by a confused group of townspeople expecting evacuation orders to escape an impending Sangvis attack.

His fears had apparently been unfounded, however, as scores of children and their families had come from the surrounding area, and more were arriving through the gate at each passing moment. Now, it seemed, their only worry was running out of candy.
‚ÄúAlright, everyone!‚Äù Mk23‚Äôs cheery voice sounded over the base PA system. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost time for the costume contest. If you haven‚Äôt signed up you can still do so with me here at the center table. Once you‚Äôve done that please head over to the stage at the west end of the grounds. Remember, winner gets a trophy and gets to take home Miss Springfield‚Äôs Pumpkin Cake!‚Äù
He saw a familiar face through the crowd and recognized Mossberg coming his way, a caramel apple in each hand. Taking her place at his side, the T-doll offered one of the treats and bit into the other happily.

‚ÄúThe Fair is going very well, Commander. It was a fantastic idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly thanks to you and all the other girls.‚Äù Daniel said, accepting the apple and taking a bite. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pull it off without everyone‚Äôs input and hard work.‚Äù He turned to his adjutant and smiled.

‚ÄúHappy Halloween, Mossy.‚Äù

‚ÄúHappy Halloween, Commander.‚Äù

*****
&gt; MEXICO CITY, Oct. 31 - Drug policy reformers claimed victory in Mexico City Wednesday after the country&amp;#039;s Supreme Court handed down two rulings legalizing cannabis for all forms of non-commercial adult use.

&gt; &amp;quot;The rulings pave the way for adults to use marijuana in any way they see fit. We aren&amp;#039;t just talking about recreational use,&amp;quot; Froyl&amp;aacute;n Enciso, a drug policy researcher at Mexico&amp;#039;s social sciences institute, the CIDE, told UPI. In the first case, a plaintiff wanting to grow his own marijuana applied to the court for an &amp;quot;Amparo,&amp;quot; a form of constitutional protection from prosecution, so that he can plant, cultivate, harvest, prepare, possess and transport marijuana.

&gt; &amp;quot;The court has found that marijuana can be used for rituals, for recreational use, for medical use, at work, for scientific investigations. For any adult use and that it cannot be penalized,&amp;quot; Enciso said.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","I'm not saying the usage of the word is necessarily bad, but providing the context of its roots for why it could be considered to be bad.

Rolling around on the floor (which is considered a negative act) = being female genitalia? (thus implying female genitalia &amp; what having it represents, femininity &amp; being a woman, is bad)

Even if the meaning of the word has been far removed, it's still literally one step removed from using the term 'woman' as an insult, so it's no surprise some people fill in the gaps, as the commentor's friend about did.

The same goes for male gendered insults like 'dick', though it is interesting that that insult is linked more to general abrasiveness instead of cowardice and trickery.

For your last point, I have often found the term 'cocksucker' to be a strange insult that was obviously created by people who consider sexual activity as bad, and the act as befitting of a heterosexual male &amp; therefore bad (even if those who use do not share the same sentiment, or often the opposite sentiment). The insult often indicates duplicitous or repugnant behaviour from the recipient, and uses a literal term for a parent giving oral sex to a male, it's naive to think that this was the intended insult by the creators and that using it just reinforces it, no matter who is saying it.

For example, if you raise a kid using gay/cocksucker as insults, when you tell the kid about people who are gay/ suck cocks, their first thought will be, ""these people are bad"". Just try explaining that it isn't literal, it's gonna take years to unlearn that ingrained habit that gay/ cock sucking = bad.

Personally, as a man, I try &amp; surround myself with as many of them literal cocksuckers as I can, I consider it an outwardly positive trait, to be honest.",1541030487

Some things could go wrong with this approach though, for instance, Idk how a Rigidbody would behave if you *turn it off* and then *on*, you may lose all the acceleration information that was happening when the object was grabbed. And , that would translate in you throwing a ball and the ball falling down stacionary without any velocity bc it's Rigidbody was *off* when it *gained momentum* 

Another intersting approach is to , somehow, modify the  grabbable object's Rigidbody to *ignore collisions* with the physical hands when it's grabbed.   I've a similar project in which I'll be working these days so I may tell you the updates.",1541030487

And with more and more teams going smaller, having him on the floor as a glass cleaner would help tremendously.    
  
If he can defend at a high level-- and he *should* be able to, though that's never a given, even for guys already in the NBA-- that would make a bigger difference in him going as high as third. Because the biggest question marks around him for me involve how he defends at the next level, as he's not quite as laterally quick as many in the 6'7ish range, but he's probably too short to defend the bigger guys even with his strength. PJ Washington will be a *great* early challenge for him-- we'll see if he's up for it. ",1541030487

"IronThroneRP","t5_345ny","Tyanna's lips pursed as a storm worthy of the one raging outside crossed over her features as Dario Dynilos, true to form, made an utter nuisance of himself. It was not just mild effort that was required of her to keep from going for her sword and shoving it through Lord Dynilos' eye socket, though the fact that the man brought forth such a wealth of emotion in her was something to be pondered later. Much later. When she could regain some feeling in her limbs, perhaps. Though a long, arduous death through pneumonia also sounded a fair trade if it meant she could excuse herself from the gathering.

Before she could put forth another argument toward the cause of her freedom, however, a large woman seeming to consist of primarily bosom and motherly chiding bundled her in towels that felt uncomfortably welcome and ushered her out of the door. With the suffering grimaces of a saint sent to death, she endured the overwhelming attention, gripping the ends of the towel around her violently shaking shoulders.

""I'm quite alright,"" she protested finally, only to receive huffs and clucks in response as a door was thrown open at the top of the stairs and she, unceremoniously, shoved in through it.

Disoriented by the whirl of skirts and overwhelming femininity, Tyanna was rendered speechless as Helen Dynilos took charge of her and pushed her near a fire. As much as she appreciated the lick of warmth as it spread through her, the frown on the Admiral's brow seemed reluctant to dissipate.

""It's too much trouble, I-"" she started once more, finding herself conversing with a back that was in the process of ignoring her as she looked to peel off her jacket from underneath the mountain of towels. 

Tya sighed, given just enough time to feel somewhat sorry for herself, but then the flurry started anew, the piles of skirts pouring into the room seemingly meant for her only managing to deepen her scowl. As Helen fluttered about, laying out the items, the sword kit was really the only thing that caught her eye. As if roused from a nightmare of minor proportions, Tya unsheathed her sword and reached for oil and cloth, laying the blade across her knees. If Helen or the maids gave her any odd looks - which she was certain they did, for who wouldn't consider it queer to find a lady soaked to the bone, seated in britches and an undershirt, polishing a prized sword instead of cooing over gowns - Tyanna paid them no heed.

""Whatever you think is best, lady Helen,""Tya said, placated, much to her own surprise. ""You'll find I don't wear enough gowns to hold an opinion."" 

As if an oasis of calm had sprung amid a desert of confusion, Tya's hands warmed as she quickly and efficiently worked the sword, leaving the seamstress and Helen to converse over best fit. By the time she was done, her long, sultry black hair had been undone and pinned up in an updo far more delicate than any one that Tyanna Iranohr had been seen in since the passing of her mother, showing off a slender neck and a pointed chin, errant strands framing her features.

With stoicism bred into her by years of enduring torment only she had decided to bring on herself, she stood patiently as clothes were removed from her, wet rags more than anything else, and replaced by pretty underthings and one dress after another, until finally a decision had been made. With corset tightened, hem corrected, and a mild argument about appropriate footwear sharply ended, Tyanna Iranohr was released from the clutches of the flock of doves, left behind to whisper among themselves about how a bilge rat could be transformed to someone remarkably... well, pretty. It seemed to come as a surprise to everyone.

Helen Dynilos clutched Tya's elbow gently as she led the two of them down the stairs, talking softly and with admiring words of how fine a figure Tya had for the latest fashion, the steely grey dress with teal paneling and bright, golden yellow and teal embroidery running up the skirts in snake-like patterns seeming perfect for her. Oddly perfect, really, seeing as it even featured the house colors of Iranohr, a fact Tya kindly overlooked, choosing to believe that coincidences were simply coincidences.

""Now, Tyanna, are you certain you must keep the sword? Oh trust me, it would be safe with-""

""Yes, I must keep it,"" Tyanna said, stifling the sigh at the conversation that came for the fifth time at least. 

The sword was safely on her hip, as usual, as the duo made it down the stairs and along the corridor, where a guard scrambled to open the doors for them. Helen beamed, comfortable in her role as a fairy godmother. Tya, well, she required a stiff drink, but none the less, she held herself with the grace of a woman who, at one point in her life, wore plenty of plunging necklines and whale boning. It was not a period she particularly yearned to relive, but there was something to be said for no longer feeling as if death was to claim her at any second.",1541030489

‚ÄúObscured‚Äù was a way to keep her shroud without making it underpowered. Since you know that she‚Äôs somewhere in her shroud, it needed something extra to make it more than just a shitty version of regular invisibility.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; At least the Conservative people I talk to

Ah! So you have civil discussions with people whose worldview you share, that's nice. 

The traditional liberals you speak of haven't gone anywhere. The Right unfortunately has been purged of moderates, so they look at the Left like they're from another planet, when the Left hasn't moved or changed policy positions in a generation (Obama was practically and Eisenhower Republican for god's sake). In fact, true conservatism (to which I personally identify) is a branch *of* liberalism and it is under threat by the GOP in general, and Trump in particular. 

Conservatism prizes the institutions which safeguard liberty from the waxing and waning of political partisanship... I've seen nothing but an assault on these institutions from the American Right for almost my entire life. Whether it's AM radio and Fox News's assault on objective truth, or the sustained attack against the independent judiciary or the more recent attacks on the free press, justice department, and entire intelligence community by the president and his enablers. 

The characterization above is correct - the party prizes winning above all else and only embraces conditional principles which further that end (and then promptly abandon them when they don't). As a classical conservative I have no choice but to vote Democrat, not only because they agree with me on social issues and safeguarding checks against private power... but because they, at the end of the day, will choose the *system* over the party.... just look: when Democrats do something wrong, they get abandoned quick. When Republicans do something wrong, the accuser, the reporters, the investigators, everyone but the wrongdoer is thrown under the bus. ",1541030491

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Right? No one is willing to give up their bodily autonomy rights, and yet they call for women to do just that. (Just to be clear, lots of pro-life people are women -- but for them I suppose it's mostly a non-issue, since they want to give birth and would never* exercise their right to choose in the first place, so they don't care whether they have that right or not.)

It's disturbing. Does no one want to consider the ramifications of taking away bodily autonomy under certain circumstances? Making it law that sometimes, other people (fetuses, since they view fetuses as people) gain ownership over a woman's body and can use her body as long as they need to survive, is really, just terrifying. It would inherently be writing into law that women are not equal humans (certainly, no one is trying to say men don't own their organs) and that their rights can be infringed upon just because they're women.

How anyone is okay with this, I have no idea. I think people just take bodily autonomy for granted right now. But can you imagine if there were a way to say, save a life, by forcing a tennis ball through the urethra of a man? Suddenly, it would be all ""consent matters! You can't force men to undergo extreme pain, physical complications, and emotional distress just to save lives! Men have rights!"" but... as it is, pro-lifers don't see forcing women to undergo an extremely similar process, as immoral or as an infringement on their bodily rights. (I suspect a lot of that has to do with religious belief that dictates women are made for baby-making, so therefore it's fine.)

Anyway. The implication is disturbing, not to mention dangerous. How people aren't terrified of the idea of other people using their organs/blood/body when they need it, I have no idea. Because that's what pro-life policies do. If it's not okay to do to men, it isn't okay to do to women either. And exactly like you said. You can't even force people to donate blood, which isn't even on the same planet in regards to health risks when it comes to pregnancy!

Fucking. Yeesh.

\* *However though, some pro-life women do end up getting abortions anyway. Because it's justified when they do it. And yet, they still want to take those rights away from... themselves? It's literally insane. How do people like this exits. I have no idea.*",1541030492

"politics","t5_2cneq","Good point.

But Obama didn't so much order the change in class definition so much as remind the government of the existing law. His executive order was important because it changed the definition used by the executive branch in investigation and prosecution of PG violations. However, Obama has 0 power over the Judicial Branch's rulings on the matter. He couldn't have given the executive order, if the PG definition wasn't already law.

So how is it already law?

1. It is illegal to discriminate based on biological sex.
2. It is illegal to fire a man for doing something a woman would not be fired for
3. A woman would not be fired for dating a man
4. Therefore it would be illegal discrimination to fire a man for dating a man.

Applies in virtually all cases of sexual orientation.

You wouldn't fire a woman for wearing a dress, can't fire a man for wearing a dress.

You wouldn't fire a woman for going by ""she/her"", can't fire a man for going by ""she/her""

Of course it also works with all the genders reversed as well.

So while Obama's executive order is important to the EEOC it is not important to those seeking damages for wrongful firing.",1541030492

"shrooms","t5_2qszq","This is not true, at least for a competent individual. Every psychiatrist I saw picked what medications to give by either the equivalent of throwing darts on a dartboard or because they got free samples from a pharmacy company. The best ones will just run off experience which isn't actually very helpful because it just ends up in them picking their favourite placebo-tier SSRI, brain-shrinking antipsychotic etc... The first medication I requested, I was talked into taking an SSRI instead and guess what, when I finally moved onto the one I picked after trying a bunch of horrible meds it was the only medication I tried that helped at least somewhat. Doctors were wrong, I was right. It culminated in ECT being my only option, when I said I'm going to do ayahuasca instead the psych said it would make me psychotic when I've never had any history of such. And there's good scientific literature out there proving the efficacy and safety of ayahuasca so it just shows you can't expect these people to be aware of new research, only new free samples from pharma companies. 

TL:DR Most psychiatrists are bastards who provide an improper standard of care and will try to manipulate and bully you into taking whatever they give you no matter how bad for you it actually is. How can you expect someone who has no spiritual wisdom to understand something as complex as depression because even on the physical level they have very little idea of what is going on and psychiatric illnesses at their core are spiritual/existential.

"sleeptrain","t5_3f3ch","I know you said no CIO so please forgive me, but I wanted to share my experience. My baby is 7 months old and we just did sleep training a couple of weeks ago. He was sleeping in his cot and has been for a long time but was waking up SO many times a night that it was driving me crazy, so my husband strongly encouraged me to give sleep training a go (I was very anti-CIO). We tried Ferber at first and found that me going in made it worse. In saying that, it took 12 minutes of crying that first night for him to go to sleep. The second night we left him and it took ONE minute. In two weeks, it's only ever taken a few minutes for him to fall asleep and a handful of times he literally hasn't cried at all! I still wanted to rock him to sleep for naps but he wouldn't even let me do that anymore so I started to put him down drowsy but awake and sing him to sleep. After a week, that didn't work either and he now self-settles for naps too. I know it is so, so hard but maybe consider giving it a go? I feel like my baby just needed the space to learn how to sleep and in the whole two weeks he has only woken up once per night to nurse, has slept 11-12 hours per night and is way happier during the day! It was tough, for sure, but the benefits are far outweighing the cost (for all of us). I read a quote that said something like ""we place so many needs on our babies at night but their biggest need is quality sleep"" and yes there are exceptions to this when they really need us and our comfort, but sleep is so important too! Sorry if this isn't helpful but I wanted to share just in case - all the best! :)",1541030492

So I got curious about the OP, CheapManufacturer, a 3-month old account, with a history of posting things like this:

[Constipated Mueller memes](https://imgflip.com/i/2lfa4c)

&gt;You're a nut for thinking Jill Stein is a Russian agent, you belong on this sub.

.

&gt;I am suspicious of the Russia investigation, it seems more targeted at Bernie Sanders and social democracy ideas than Trump. Modern Palmer raids.

.

&gt;&gt;All the Russians giving illegal campaign help

&gt;0 proof that this happened.

etc.  (Also negative comment total in RussiaLago.)

Anyway, all this is to say, I'm not convinced that OP is terribly interested in a discussion in good faith.  I suspect their position is fairly cemented, and they're less interested in debate than they are (viewed charitably) interested in proselytizing and/or trolling.

We average between 15 and 25 players, depending on day and time of year, and have **no ranks or permanent roles.** This means that you could be a US Marine Squad Leader in Vietnam for one mission, followed by a near-future CSAT CAS Pilot in the next! We play in first person only with ACE medical, and follow an in-game change of command, but have no permanent leaders or ranks.

We also have **no ranks or mandatory training,** although we do ask that all members are comfortable with the real basics of ACE and ACRE before their first session, either through their own learning or one of our optional familiarisation courses. The only roles we restrict are Pilot and JTAC, as they require basic competence to be done correct.

Ironically enough, you may be on to something with the bureaucrat thing. The only woman I ever had a proper long term relationship with was an accountant.

I am perfectly willing to date someone 30+ or even divorced (though I draw the line at kids with another man) but they seem to not be interested in someone as young as me. 

On virginity, I don‚Äôt require a girl to be a virgin. That‚Äôs unreasonable. I lost my virginity in a one night stand. It was shit. It was a combination of leftie media programming and flattery that a girl would actually be into me that made me do it. I understand if a woman had done something similar.

&gt; Kampala Archbishop Cyprian Kizito Lwanga has fronted a controversial proposal that seeks to have the central government deduct 10% from people&amp;#039;s monthly salary and forwarded to the church.

&gt; Speaking at Saint Mary&amp;#039;s Cathedral Rubaga during mass, the Catholic Archbishop said many Christians don&amp;#039;t tithe and this affects projects by the church.

&gt; &amp;quot;I was told Germans make agreements with their government to deduct monthly tithe from their salaries and forward it to the church and this money they use to build and renovate their churches,&amp;quot; he added.

It's equally laughable that there is any amount of housing that could be built that would actually have an effect on the desirability. Why do you think LA keeps sprawling across the lower half of the state? It's because there isn't a finite number of people who want to live there. Do you really want to see housing construction happen at the rate of SoCal, but within the confines of the peninsula? Look at Singapore for example. There isn't even a tech boom there, and the land area is 5 times that of SF, yet the individual purchasing power there is still insane. You think that somehow, we are going to be able to fit everyone that wants to live in SF for the foreseeable future by just building more housing? How would you even suggest doing something like that? Demolish any building smaller than 10 stories and force real-estate developers to build massive high-rises, and then tell them they can only charge reasonable rates?

"thenetherlands","t5_30hrx","&gt;Ik denk niet dat ""lijden is slecht, geluk is goed"" (of negatieve/positieve ervaringen, zoals ik het liever noem) nou echt subjectief is.

Ik wil niet the nihilistisch doen, maar het idee dat lijden slecht is komt door de menselijke ervaring, zonder de menselijke ervaring bestaan positieve en negatieve ervaringen niet. Het universem zelf maakt het vrij weinig uit of mensen lijden of niet. Daarmee is het dus al inherent subjectief aan de menselijke ervaring.

Maar om het wat realistischer te maken (deze discussie zou namelijk vrij zinloos zijn als je uberhaupt geen aannames doet, anders kan je alles subjectief noemen.)
Wat ik als negatief ervaar kan voor iemand anders een positieve ervaring zijn, er zijn sadisten die genot vinden in andermans lijden. Ik persoonlijk niet. Er zijn mensen die geen negatieve gevoelens associeren met (zelf)moord, ik associeer wel negatieve gevoelens met (zelf)moord. Maar ik kan niet zeggen dat hun gevoelens en de moraliteit die zij er mee associeren zo zeer fout is, alleen dat ik vanuit mijn perspectief het er niet mee eens ben.

&gt;Hier gebruik je wenselijk vs niet wenselijk, die woordkeuze kan ik me in vinden voor iets subjectiefs. Maar als mensen zeggen ""ik vind dat x goed is"" maar tegelijkertijd ontkennen dat iets objectief goed kan zijn, dat ligt niet lekker. Iets ""is"" namelijk alleen maar als het objectief is.

Je zou het slordig kunnen noemen, ik zeg vaak gewoon is omdat ik alles vanuit mijn eigen perspectief zeg, dat is namelijk het enige perspectief dat ik echt heb. Ik zou eigenlijk altijd vind moeten zeggen.

&gt;Ik kan er niet goed bij hoe het kan dat je de moraliteit van anderen niet accepteert als je niet gelooft in een objectieve moraliteit. Je hebt geen doel om ze mee te vergelijken zonder objectieve moraliteit. Je hebt alleen je eigen moraliteit, maar die kun je ook niet vergelijken... jouw moraliteit komt dan neer op een willekeurig punt in een hyperspace (willekeurig omdat ook al redeneer je je er helemaal stuk over, geen enkele moraliteit is beter dan een ander, want er is geen objectieve moraliteit volgens jou). En iemand anders zijn moraliteit is een ander willekeurig punt in een hyperspace... en jij oordeelt dan op basis van hoe ver die twee willekeurige punten van elkaar af liggen.


Tja, ik zeg niet dat mijn moraliteit objectief beter is. Alleen dat ik mijn moraliteit keuzes prefereer over die van andere. Ik keur ze af op het feit dat mijn moraliteit zegt dat ik sommig gedrag niet moet tolereren. Verder zegt mijn gutfeeling dat er niks mis is met mensen straffen als ze de leefregels die wij als maatschappij afgesproken hebben dus daar is ook niet echt een probleem.


Als ik rood mooi vind en iemand anders blauw, dan betekent dat niet dat zijn voorkeur voor iets anders minder terecht is dan mijn voorkeur voor rood. Dat betekent echt niet dat ik hem alles blauw laat schilderen als ik eigenlij wil dat het rood is.

"witcher","t5_2sebi","&gt;black=good and white=bad beliefs*

The fuck? Again, making a strawman thats way off-base with what I am saying.

Are you seriously trying to tell me black panther (again, pay real close attention to the name) is not about black empowerment because it takes place in a fictional nation? The entire premise of the nation is a black nation with economic and technological superiority over other nations where black people look down upon outsiders with less than they have. This is a really pointed inverse of how developing nations in Africa typically are and the inverse of how black people are perceived around the world by other races. Jesus christ you're a dense motherfucker. Like if anything, its a little hamhanded with the symbolism and you STILL seemed to have missed the entire point of the movie. Fuck man, its one thing to have a difference of opinion or inturpretation but this is next level. It's the premise of the WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE. T'Challa fights to open boarders and bring up others who are doing worse. He invests in communities that don't do as well. He says they need to be open with other nations instead of isolating themselves and looking down on them like his predecessors. All these metaphors for real phenomenon in black communities in America and for international relations between countries where just lost on you? Come on, man.

Whatever, this is all off-base anyways.

I said black panther is about race, so race is important there. The plot, symbolism, characters, AND EVEN THE NAME OF THE COMIC are based around black empowerment. If race matters to a conveyed point in any medium, then it should be consistent unless some counterpoint or something is being made about the original work. The Witcher is not based off race at all, has multiple different nations, and is in a high-fantasy setting anyways. Races were altered before and nobody gave a fuck until they used a POC. These were the distinct points I made.

What you took is some weird discrimination thing fueled by a victim complex. Get over yourself. Nobody is attacking white people. You don't have to be so sensative. Don't panick: the cast is still mostly white. God forbid that changes in A HIGH FANTASY UNIVERSE WHERE NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE REAL ANYWAYS.

Unless you made a fuss about triss having red hair or geralt having a beard in Witcher 3, then you have no right to claim its an issue with it not being in line with the books. If you're a purest who actually read the books and is insistent that art never changes across media, then that's a separate issue, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say, based purely off what you've said and your blatant inability to interpret obvious symbolism, that this is not the case amd you probably have not read much at all.",1541030497

With social media companies directing you things that only confirm your world view has created a big rift between both sides. Like any form of media, they know that outrage sells. it's hard to have a civil debate anymore because people are living in different worlds from one another. This is a very angry, divided time for our country, and we need to be careful to watch confirmation bias if we can move forward as a country. BTW it's definitely here on Reddit. As a guy who leans to the left, I get down voted on more liberal subreddits whenever I suggest trying to understand the other side and reach compromise. Not everybody on the left is an evil Nazi. We are not in the Weimar republic, and Trump's not Hitler. I don't become outraged just because someone has a different ideology than me. I talk to them and try to find common ground.

Edit: I know I'll probably get down voted, but I hope I can at least convince someone to take a step back and question how they view opposing ideologies. I've made this point in other subreddits only to be called an apologist and getting down voted to hell, pretty much proving my point.

It's something that all of us in the community end up benefiting from - we have a nice place to talk, where the developers will actually interact with people or at the very least see their content.

That goes away, if it becomes an anarchical hellscape of negativity and anger, where the conversation is dominated by the small percentage of people that are just so motivated to have this specific side of them heard. 

So they get to say their piece, sometimes for hundreds of posts, until the conversation becomes circular and ugly. Sometimes it takes months or even years for either the fanboys or trolls to test patience to the point when it becomes enough.

compare that to the average MMORPG, where you are forced to play within a limit that caters to a specific rigid standard (excluding private-ran/hacked servers here, also)

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","Where exactly did ADB say that Perturabo was no longer a Daemon Prince in canon? Doesn't sound like something he'd say at all, and I am aware of no sources dealing with him in 40k that claim Perturabo is still a mortal.

In the Chaos Space Marine codex (2017) he is listed quite explicitly as a ""Daemon Primarch"", and his current activities are also mentioned:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This planetsized stronghold is the domain of the Primarch Perturabo ‚Äì reincarnated as a mighty Daemon Prince by the Ruinous Powers that guide him, he has become a being of inconceivable destructive power whose warp-infused hammer, Forgebreaker, can shatter the rockcrete walls of a fortress with a single blow.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The Grand Siege Begins**  
&gt;  
&gt;Having studied the Imperial defences of Segmentum Obscurus in detail via a combination of remote scrying, methodically applied torture of captive loyalists and a network of techno-cultist informants, Perturabo learns much of their capabilities and limitations. When Cadia finally falls and the Cicatrix Maledictum splits the galaxy from end to end, the Daemon Primarch mobilises a thousand armies and coordinates them in a grand strategy that targets the most heavily defended Imperial worlds in the segmentum.  
&gt;  
&gt;So begins a brutal blockade of the Imperium itself. As Perturabo‚Äôs embittered armies march forth, menageries of Daemon Engines and batteries of artillery machines at their side, a dozen fortified worlds previously thought  inviolable are brought to the edge of total disaster by the Iron Warriors‚Äô merciless siege tactics.

"NavyBlazer","t5_32edi","I was in Target a while back and noticed that they changed over from their Merona label to the Goodfellow and Co. label. The Goodfellow polo shirts seem the same as the Merona polos. I'm mentioning this because I have a lot of these polos that do the job for layering or for traveling when I don't want to take my Brooks Brothers polos. If you pick the right colors (white, navy, burgundy and maybe yellow) you can't go wrong, just avoid purple, turquoise, pre-faded and heathered colors. The dark colors like navy lose color in the fiber tips after multiple washings, giving a weird whitish sheen to the fabric, but the white polos are just fine and at 14.99 (or less on sale), I'm not complaining.

They also have various sweaters and khakis that are good. For me, the khakis are too slim fit, and just don't look good on me, because I'm older, but that fit is in style and just fine on younger men. They also have halfway decent boat shoes.

He actually multiple twitter accounts. The account you referenced appeared to be a burner account where he put stuff that gave him a higher risk of being banned, which is probably why he didn't follow right-wing sources on that account. The other account did follow those sources.

I almost made it to the end of the schhol day, chairs were on desks, bell was about to ring, and there she blew. Gross and embarrasing. It was on a trip back from new york were i threw up, held it in, and tapped my mom on the shoulder with a mouth full of vomit. We had just pulled up to the airport. I got out and got rid of it in the gutter. I cant remember if it was the same trip but I threw up on myself on the plane. I think thats when my parents finally decided to find out what was wrong with me. The doctor knew right away what was wrong. I had to stop eating sugar. I never quite understood the whole hypo hyper glycemia. I thought he said it was hypoglycemia  but i may have misheard it. I was super small, think i weighed 57 pounds in the 5th grade, so who know how small i was in second grade.  The migraines did stop after that, but im still prone to headaches.

I love Wright, and I don't for one second regret that contract, but he didn't not perform to his contract. And besides, I wasn't saying that Goldschmidt would be bad in 2020. I just expect Alonso to be good by 2020. We'd be better offer signing Donaldson or Moustakas then trading for Goldschmidt. They would cost either the same or less in salary, but won't cost any prospects, and they at least have position versatility. But really we don't need any of those guys.

"formula1","t5_2qimj","Well, They're really unique teams to look into. 

Both Williams and McLaren are super popular teams with massively successful periods in the sport, so their brand still has some decent pulling power in terms of sponsorship, so whilst they may not be receiving the sponsorship income that Red Bull gets, they'll probably get more than Haas and Sauber for example, or a new team. 

As outifts they've also diversified their revenue creating streams, so Williams does a lot of outsourcing of their engineering work, from battery technology to industrial sectors to aerodynamic input in commercial sectors. They are the cause for the aero deflectors you'll see in some UK supermarkets (I recently learned for example) which apparently reduce energy loss by 70%. 

McLaren meanwhile have started a fully fledged car company - you may have noticed - and as well as their Applied Technologies department doing similar things as Williams do; they also happen to provide services to motorsport in general. Many spec sports use parts designed and built by McLaren Tech. Like every F1 car on the grid use their ECU's. as does IndyCar and NASCAR I believe. 

The long and short of it is, McLaren are worth a small fortune and have very wealthy shareholders. 

Williams aren't to that standard however, but they'll certainly continue in their current vain with their revenue streams and likely continue to seek pay drivers to subsidise their racing programme and hopefully seek to increase their revenue stream. ",1541030506

They couldn't be cold, unlikely to be a ninja.  Sharia Law?  Anarchist?  They don't like getting flies and other insects in their face?

It was strange.  The person walking in front of mean jumped away at the sight.  Bankrobber was another possibility that was considered.

The Yankees right fielder had a mask on, he may have come on as a defensive replacement, but that was because he was cold.  There is a growing number of masks, islamic and other, and most are not what the West needs.

A ninja costume for Hallowe'en?  If it had some Japanese writing on it, that would help people understand that the costume is not about nutjobs attacking windows and people who don't vote how they want them to.

It‚Äôs like the one thing I *didn‚Äôt* get totally full blown addicted to. Haha. 

100% sober for over 3 years now though woot woot 

Edit: u/FuriouslyWastingTime made a very good point, something I should have included initially. **Cocaine is absolutely a ridiculously addictive substance.** Just because I have an addictive personality and I didn't get hooked doesn't mean that no one else will. Every person is different, and for whatever reason, heroin was my main vice and I was able to do cocaine in moderation and stop. That said, several of the people I did cocaine with for that summer of 2012 went on to have years-long addictions to it. So don't take my comment as ""You can't get addicted to cocaine!"" because you definitely, definitely can.",1541030508

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","I actually bought my first henly, 2 flannels and my first pair of non-dark jeans! Yeah I'm honestly really new to fashion and stuff I usually would wear pretty unflattering clothes. I kept saying... I'll wait till Im skinny to buy clothes and I would only buy pants in size 35 or less (when my waist was 38!) so that I would have something to look forward to. 

And back when I was 235 I had no motivation to get my hair cut... my beard trimmed... I didn't really like the way I looked. I honestly sometimes looked in the mirror with my shirt off and was really sad, but then I'd put on clothes and think ""ok I look fine in clothes."" 

Once I get to 185 I'm going to go wild lol. Spend a bunch on some brands I've been looking at. 

You aren't alone at all man, I struggled with my weight for like 5 years or more, it's crazy how hard it can be to lose weight. But at the same time if you make it a priority it really is possible.

Another thing I did, which won't work if you don't have disposable income, is start eating more fish, meat, avacados, and rich people food since rich people are leaner haha. I found I was getting nice and full and not having cravings. Also eggs were a good one for me. 

Idk if you are someone who eats chips or things like that, or if you eat out? But maybe a rule could be - only eat out once a week. Or only eat chips on the weekend. 

Just do me a favour and do one small thing... just one little habit that you will keep. Idk if it's cutting down mcdonalds from 3 times to 1 time, or eating after 10am for a week... or eating a serving of brocoli every day... just try it out and see what happens!

"Glitch_in_the_Matrix","t5_2tcwa","Similar thing happened to me a few months ago. I had a missed call from my grandma who‚Äôs is saved as such in my phone. I pressed her name in the call log to ring her back, a few minutes later. 

A man answers. Convo goes something like 
‚ÄúHi grandma sorry I missed your call‚Äù
‚ÄúUh what‚Äù deep male voice 
‚ÄúUmm is this my grandma?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you with my grandma?‚Äù
‚ÄúI have no idea who your grandma is‚Äù
‚ÄúUmmmm is this number xxx-xxx-xxxx? Bc that‚Äôs my grandmas number...‚Äù
‚ÄúYes my number is xxx-xxx-xxxx but I‚Äôm not your grandma stop playing‚Äù

Then he hangs up. I call my grandpa on his cell phone bc the next rational thing is that maybe my grandma got a new phone and number. Grandpa tells me she still has same phone and number, but they use their home phone to call my grandmas cell phone number to make sure. Sure enough, my grandmas phone rings. 

Now to be clear, people in my family aren‚Äôt ones to play pranks like this on each other, nor technologically capable or knowledgeable either. Trips me out thinking about this, esp bc I checked the phone number with the random dude I talked to.  ",1541030509

Also, search for Katie Carney on youtube, she lives in her car and uploads vids talking about the experience, with lots of tips on types of places to park-n-stay and so on. 

I think it's a fabulous idea, and I've been wanting to do something like it myself for a while, but my car is just so uncomfortable to sleep in. I've seen a couple vids from people who've taken their passenger and back seat out and it makes a lot more room, so maybe someday...

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","Uh... Actually:

g(x) = 2‚àöx = 2x^(1/2)

h(x) = 9x^(2) \+ 2x - 5

g'(x)= x^(-1/2) = 1/(‚àöx)

h'(x) = 18x + 2

&amp;#x200B;

You would plug it in like this:

f'(x) = \[\[g(x) \* h'(x)\] - \[h(x) \* g'(x)\]\] / \[h(x)\]^(2) 

f'(x) = \[\[(2‚àöx) \* (18x + 2)\] - \[(9x^(2) \+ 2x - 5) \* (1/(‚àöx))\] / (9x^(2) \+ 2x - 5)^(2)

f'(x) = \[36x^(3/2) \+ 4‚àöx\] - \[9x^(3/2) \+ 2‚àöx - 5/(‚àöx)\] / (9x^(2) \+ 2x - 5)^(2)

f'(x) = \[36‚àö(x^(3)) + 4‚àöx - 9‚àö(x^(3)) - 2‚àöx + 5/(‚àöx)\] / (9x^(2) \+ 2x - 5)^(2)

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I would plug in the 5...

f'(5) = \[36‚àö(5^(3)) + 4‚àö5 - 9‚àö(5^(3)) - 2‚àö5 + 5/(‚àö5)\] / (9(5)^(2) \+ 2(5) - 5)^(2)

f'(5) = \[36‚àö125 + 4‚àö5 - 9‚àö125 - 2‚àö5 + 5/(‚àö5)\] / (9(25) + 10 - 5)^(2)

f'(5) = \[36(‚àö(25\*5)) + 4‚àö5 - 9‚àö(25\*5) - 2‚àö5 + 5/(‚àö5)\] / (225 + 10 - 5)^(2)

(Remember that ‚àö(a\*b) can be rewritten as (‚àöa)\*(‚àöb).)

f'(5) = \[36\*(‚àö25)\*(‚àö5) + 4‚àö5 - 9\*(‚àö25)\*(‚àö5) - 2‚àö5 + 5/(‚àö5)\] / (230)^(2)

f'(5) = \[36\*5\*‚àö5 + 4‚àö5 - 9\*5\*‚àö5 - 2‚àö5 + 5/(‚àö5)\] / 52900

f'(5) = \[180‚àö5 + 4‚àö5 - 45‚àö5 - 2‚àö5 + 5/(‚àö5)\] / 52900

The plan for rebuilding it is deploy a new VCSA directly to an ESX host, then restore the backup to it.  This is a pretty well documented feature of the VCSA, you may want to read up on it before trashing the solution most people use without significant issue.  There's no reason to run it on a standalone ESX host since you're introducing even more risk by not having cluster HA on it - you've made a bad situation worse.  You deal with the DC situation by having 2 DCs with anti-affinity rules so they're never on the same ESX host. Your initial problem is also resolved by directly connecting to the ESX host it's running on, this is also documented in the VMware KB for increasing disk size on a VCSA.

No doubt, democratic countries are trying to keep taiwan alive, esp the us. But, china and taiwan are technically the same country, so breaking off will be a cause for war. Taiwan can only break off when china are weak, which does not seem possible within the next 50 years

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","Do you have a v20? Download accubattery and let it run in the background for a few days so it can accurately measure your battery life. It can give an estimated screen on time, screen off time, etc. You can compare this directly to my accubattery stats. While they are not totally accurate (they seem to overestimate in some places and underestimate in others), if we are using the same measurement app, the deviation from the real measurement should be proportional. Then we can compare directly real time stats from two people using their phone normally instead of some simulated tests.

Furthermore, I don't think I said it's equivalent to two removable batteries. But what I meant is that it's significant enough to be close. For my experience, I got maybe 4 hrs max sot on the v20 on a good day, and on my v35 I have gotten I believe 7+hrs (mind you, this would be on 1080p, which I am not sure if it has a significant difference on battery life or not).

Now, there are several explanations for this possible difference. One is the display. It is very possible that the display, one of if not the not draining parts of the smartphone, on the v20 is more power-hungry than on the v30. It's p-OLED vs ips-lcd after all, and generally I use lots of dark background apps on my v35, so that could contribute a lot to the increased battery life.

Another point is the newer chipset. The snapdragon 820 used a 14nm process I believe, and was the first flagship snapdragon chipset to do so iirc, whereas the v35 I have has the 845, which if I'm not wrong is the second flagship chipset to use 10nm from Qualcomm, so they have had even longer to optimize the process than with the 820. these process shrinks contribute greatly to battery life increases, one good example is the Samsung galaxy s6, when it was first released people scoffed at the tiny battery, and it was indeed very tiny. But the process shrinks from 20nm to 14nm (don't quote me on the numbers but it did have a process shrink) greatly helped the battery life as the 2xxx mAh battery would have given maybe 3-4ish hrs tops sot on a last gen chipset, where I recall my brother generally getting 5-6 sot, and he is a medium-heavy user imo.

I know that's a lot of info but if you don't have access to a v20 with accubattery perhaps someone else could volunteer to put forth this info so we can get some real time data to compare. Hopefully all of this helps. ",1541030514

In Georgia's most recent purge by Brian Kemp, under these circumstances,

&gt;An Associated Press analysis revealed that while Georgia's population is  32% African-American, according to the most recent Census data, a full  70% of the 53,000 voters whose registration status had been put on hold  identified as such, leading critics to accuse Kemp of deliberately  disenfranchising likely Abrams voters.

On one side you have women being the victim to almost everything and on the other side, men and women are basically the same. You want to put women in danger? Or to make violence against women more possible? Make it more socially acceptable to have men and women go into the same room together where you're supposed to pull your pants down.

"LARP","t5_2rl8h","""Actual LARP""? 

You know, I play mostly nordic/nordic inspired/international games these days, and hardly any fantasy games anymore. But that doesn't change the fact that fantasy games are part of *every* LARP culture. And that most, if not all, veterans and big names of many play styles started with a sword in their hand. A lot of organizers /organizer groups have started out with fantasy games - and then moved to different projects. Claus Raasted is probably best known internationally for his (former) involvement with the College of Wizardry LARPs. I know him as the guy I once contacted to play in his fantasy battle LARP.

It is true that some game styles have evolved more, have been refined more, while others have stagnated. I myself consider quite a few fantasy games simply not worth my time anymore - been there, done that - but I hate this elitist nonsense.

Without a massive organization doing their best to cover up your crimes thats pretty much impossible right?  Especially 420 of the same race, like that many people needs organization and organization leaves a paper trail. Op Sec of that group is shot, like if one of the 420 isn't into child rape and runs to the police, boom the whole operation is over. 

Like how do you even find 420 middle eastern child rapists with a town that only haves 4552 middle eastern males in the first place (stat includes elderly and children). Who knows I might be way off point but I can't help to see the Rotherham case becoming more and more of a witch hunt then 10% of the muslims male population of Rotherham was in the same massive child rape gang.

*****
&gt; Court documents unsealed after nearly 45 years show that a federal grand jury in February 1974 was prepared to indict former GOP President Richard Nixon on four criminal counts for his role in the 1970s Watergate scandal that led to his resignation.

&gt; The draft of the indictment from a Washington grand jury stated that &amp;quot;From on or about March 21, 1973Richard M. Nixon unlawfully, willfully and knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate and agree together and with co-conspiratorsto commit briberyobstruct justiceand obstruct a criminal investigation.""

&gt; Despite the ongoing investigation and a bombshell report from Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein that said the FBI believed Nixon aides were responsible for the Watergate break-in, Nixon won re-election in 1972 against Democratic Senator George McGovern of South Dakota.

In fact it necessitates I hate them.   


When the bigots say that trans folk should use the bathroom of their assigned birth what they say it's to protect women from rape, but there's no actual statistical evidence to back that actually happens, meanwhile 70% of transwomen report being assaulted or harrassed in a bathroom. Then you ask, ""Well what about transmen like Buck Angel? Would you want them using the same bathroom as your wife or daughter?!"" Do you know what the answer is? ""No, because they shouldn't exist.""  


This is the subtext that we don't pay attention to, they're motivated by bigotry and hating them is not ""just as bad"" it's a means of protecting one's self. This is the common string that ties all of conservative ideology together: Lower taxes; cutting public safety nets hurts minorities more than whites. Voter ID laws; typically combined with closing down offices that issue such IDs in minority communities, it's more financially burdensome for the poor to get IDs due to having to take off from work when they're already living paycheck to paycheck and because minorities tend to be more likely to be impoverished. Religious freedom; to persecute, ostracize, harass, or discriminate against queer folk.

Of course I trolled them - running circles around them trying to kick their horse - eventually I crashed into them and we both toppled. When we both got to our feet they fired more but I cold-coked them and knocked them out which incurred the ire of some random NPC who ran off to report it. After a minute of waiting around the law showed up, I diffuse it only to turn around immediately after the wanted level disappeared then walked right back into town without issue. 

Depending on the severity of the crime in a town, bumping someone or getting into a fist fight and knocking them out etc (do not loot them) - if you stick around while the crime is being reported then wait for the law to investigate, you might be able to diffuse right then and there and they will run you out of town. Basically, walk far enough away to be outside of the red fog on the radar and you're cleared.

The downside is, you end up sticking around waiting for the law to show up which can be brutal unless you're in a town proper and they are close by.

If verbal discussion is a big component of it, or it's difficult to evaluate students individually because the rest of the course lends itself to cheating, then being there to show your face and speak your mind is like... what college was originally about.

It's entirely possible the professor is a jerk. But it's also possible that if a student hasnt shown up for three weeks, they arent a very enthused student. I have two students who seldom show up but are getting solid As. I've spoken to them both and they explained that they learn the material better on their own / don't gain much from lecture. They still show their face in office hours from time to time and honestly I'm cool with it.

That said, I have untold more students who don't show up and are getting Cs, Ds, and Fs. The majority of the time, you can bet on the fact that a student isnt showing up because they dont want to. Not because they are brilliant 18-20 year olds who are so gifted they don't need any outside help to learn anything.

"Undertale","t5_2xdht","I think you all have it wrong. The whole point of Chara‚Äôs character in Undertale was to represent consequence. Chara was no villain and they even tell you at the end of the Genocide route that YOU, the player, were the one‚Äôs that murdered everyone and have shown them that murder is right. Overwhelming evidence shows that Chara is the narrator of Undertale. In True Pacifist, the narration is overwhelmingly optimistic but they are pessimistic in Genocide. Refer to this video if you want more proof of Chara not being as evil as we thought: [Who Is the True Villain of Undertale?](https://youtu.be/MYHXpdNqdGs) 

Now, concerning the ending of Delta Rune chapter 1, Kris rips out their own soul and pulls out a knife etc. I don‚Äôt think Chara has anything to do with this. If you remember, Kris‚Äôs SOUL reaches out and touches the pillar of darkness at one point and then Kris and Susie are taken back to the real world. This is no coincidence and I think this has something to do with the ‚Äúcliff-hanger.‚Äù However, I do like the idea of this being a post-geno AU. 

I started connecting the dots when I was talking to Undyne and realized that she had never met Alphys. When I was in the diner I had an epiphany. Deltarune is just how the events of Undertale would have played out if there never was a war between monsters and humans (or the monsters won. Not sure. Kris is the only human we‚Äôve seen and the outer areas of the town are blocked off with gates/police barricades.) 

These two worlds are connected. The answer, yet again, seems to lie with Sans.

- Some combination of the above.

*****
&gt; Court documents unsealed after nearly 45 years show that a federal grand jury in February 1974 was prepared to indict former GOP President Richard Nixon on four criminal counts for his role in the 1970s Watergate scandal that led to his resignation.

&gt; The draft of the indictment from a Washington grand jury stated that &amp;quot;From on or about March 21, 1973Richard M. Nixon unlawfully, willfully and knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate and agree together and with co-conspiratorsto commit briberyobstruct justiceand obstruct a criminal investigation.""

&gt; Despite the ongoing investigation and a bombshell report from Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein that said the FBI believed Nixon aides were responsible for the Watergate break-in, Nixon won re-election in 1972 against Democratic Senator George McGovern of South Dakota.

"Xcode","t5_2r2p1","Actually you are suffering from what I call glossing over CS courses.   In my learned opinion it is an extremely bad idea to teach new students to computer science to use an IDE!!!!   Very bad!   

Instead you should be using a text editor and GCC or CLang from the command line.   That would give you some understanding of what happens under the hood with an IDE.   At that point you would know that you have many options on a Mac to run a variety of text editors and IDE's.

In any event I'm not even sure you have the basics of operating system use under your belt.  data.in should be a file supplied to you for processing, and data.out a file created by what ever you are trying to do.   In any event you need to get away from the IDE for a bit and understand how your application accesses and reads files in the file system hierarchy.    This is very basics stuff really and frankly should be part of any intro to CS.   

By the way I'm not upset with you as much as I am the way many schools teach CS and related technologies.   The reality is you need to know how to use the command line and you need to understand basic Operating System concepts to have any hope of getting anywhere in the CS world.   

By the way don't knock Mac OS, there are dozens of text editors and IDE's available for the platform.  In the case of IDE's each approaches the way it works slightly differently.   For example XCode will have your executable in a place well out of the way.  

In any event learning CS on Windows is a bit of a joke in my mind.   There are far more free resources available for Linux and Mac OS.   Further the environments with respect to Mac OS and Linux are very similar, so skills quickly transfer between the two.   You don't need to install Linux if you don't want too.   I would however suggest installing HomeBrew to get access to a variety of software development tools. HomeBrew gives you a surprising amount of open source software to run on the Mac.",1541030523

"OKmarijuana","t5_jfaop","Biggest issue with a garage grow, imo would be insects, temp, and humidity... in no particular order.

If your garage is well sealed, that helps with all three but if you have your garage open on a summer day while you mow the yard or something, you're going to be cooking your plants.  

Dont underestimate the yield you can pull out of a 2x4.  A lot of the strains you listed are going to be heavier yielders to begin with so growing 4 or 6 plants in one or two gallon pots would still get you a decent harvest.  

In a 4x4 you could do six 5 gallon pots that would easily max out your legal weight limit for flower every harvest.

Hell, if it's the garage or the closet, I'd go garage.  With your seed selection, you're going to want a small veg tent separate from your flower tent so you can select mothers from your library and start perpetually harvesting from clones.  It would suck if you grew some of that haze next to the, well, most of the others because you might have a phenotype that has a 14 or 15 week flowering time.  That's long enough to harvest twice off of your others and it's not fun when your tent is tied up for just 1 plant.

CMH bulbs with a remote ballast outside the tent will also be cheaper and run a little cooler than most LEDs. It's also a better spectrum of light for plants imo. 

Oversize your ventilation fan by a lot and hook it to a speed controller, you can turn it down to cut the noise or you can crank it up to vent heat. Combined with a good tower fan in the tent to keep a breeze going, pests will struggle to colonize in your grow.",1541030523

I recognize that I just have to deal with those feelings in a productive way but I also don‚Äôt want to deny myself the opportunity to accept and process those feelings by telling myself I‚Äôm being stupid. The heart doesn‚Äôt always use logic! Sometimes it just helps to hear other people talk about how they can relate. 

Edit - They definitely treat me like more than just a girlfriend and even refer to me as a spouse sometimes. It‚Äôs certainly not that they‚Äôre not being good to me or that expectations have been mismatched, more so a case of me being a weeny because I missss them and a little disappointment that our type of relationship means I can‚Äôt always participate. And I don‚Äôt necessarily want to vent this to them because I don‚Äôt want them to feel bad that I feel kinda bummed. I am generally good about being up front and I may express this more to them once they‚Äôre back but for now I‚Äôm gonna leave it at telling them I‚Äôll miss them because I don‚Äôt want them to feel at all bad that I feel bad during their weekend together.

"fo76","t5_jrw25","&gt; Because it splits the community

I've heard this argument before, and while that's absolutely true, I think the obverse concern is that a split solution that pleases no one actually hurts the game more from a longevity standpoint.

PvE'ers who have zero desire to fight players (and that's the majority of PvE'ers) will be bothered by being ""forced"" into combat, or in any way interfered with. You already see in this thread alone people saying they skipped this game because of the unavoidable PvP.

PvP'ers will lose interest because there is no true PvP. Even gankers/griefers need fully functional PvP to sustain playability, while actual survivalist PvP types are going to be annoyed with the slap system.

So the ""cohabitation"" model really benefits no one, suits no one, and annoys most everyone. Split servers would at least give people choice.",1541030527

*****
&gt; Court documents unsealed after nearly 45 years show that a federal grand jury in February 1974 was prepared to indict former GOP President Richard Nixon on four criminal counts for his role in the 1970s Watergate scandal that led to his resignation.

&gt; The draft of the indictment from a Washington grand jury stated that &amp;quot;From on or about March 21, 1973Richard M. Nixon unlawfully, willfully and knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate and agree together and with co-conspiratorsto commit briberyobstruct justiceand obstruct a criminal investigation.""

&gt; Despite the ongoing investigation and a bombshell report from Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein that said the FBI believed Nixon aides were responsible for the Watergate break-in, Nixon won re-election in 1972 against Democratic Senator George McGovern of South Dakota.

If you're interested in how math relates to language features, for example ""lazy"" vs ""eager"" evaluation, existential types, polymorphism, continuations, etc. it would help to read a book on programming language theory. Some universities also make course notes available online, for example [this PDF by Carnegie Mellon University's Robert Harper](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~blume/classes/aut2008/proglang/text/offline.pdf). Reading about PL theory will help you understand the mathematical foundations of language features across **all** languages, not just functional ones.

"galakzmobile","t5_3mcin","I have one for the ship that I like to call ""Clip Thrusting"".

- A small technique that utilizes hitbox clipping in order to achieve distance and speed instantaneously, making for a quick getaway in a place you don't want to stick around in. If you're surrounded or cornered by a concave-style wall where you can dip the nose of your ship into, reverse yourself into that space, and keep reversing. The best place to see this in action are rocky maps; if you back into that space and your ship immediately turns itself another way when you release the direction pad (since the ship can't fit properly), it's a good place to use this. At the same time as releasing the reverse, turbo thrust forward with a simultaneous juke in that space and it will jut you outwards faster than the enemies can react to it. Point A to point B with a snap. It's not the illusion of creating distance because of the ship returning to the 2D plane; you're actually making a big leap extremely quickly. Sometimes you don't, though- you need good positioning and timing. To disprove otherwise, you would need an insane acceleration from staying still to even make a leap as far as this technique- which makes me think that the technique maximizes acceleration the moment you leave that wall due to clipping.
- The PERFECT method is to back into the corner at an angle, where the back of the thrusters are flat against one wall, while the other wall is touching the side of the ship, and WHILE ""juke thrusting"" (to shorten the above process), tilt the back of the thrusters against the wall that was touching the side. 

It's not too eye-catching, but I can't really say much for a ship that only shoots and whatnot. The Mech is where it gets REALLY interesting. I have stuff ranging from Grapple Diffusing, Brake Slashes, Quick Attacks (2-3 charge attacks in one swing), and Lavaboarding. That one's like waterboarding, but with lava.",1541030531

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In middle school, when I was 12-14, I was extremely depressed and self harmed a lot. I was very very lonely and very sad especially because I felt like no one noticed (or if they did notice, no one cared) that I was so sad and unhappy. I wasn't even sure why I didn't feel happy and it made it worse. I definitely contemplated suicide but I feared the consequences of that action and how it would affect my family.

"oculus","t5_2uni5","IMO this is the exact reason Brendan Iribe quit. They are going to pass off Quests as updated rifts, usurping his project. I like the move but I can see why someone would be upset over that. 

on another note inside out tracking is the future windows MR got it right the first time. The base stations are the most ridiculous things about the Rift and vive its always hilarious to see people defend them. Yes you can get perfect tracking but not everyone needs a Ferrari. The complexity of setting it up and the clutter introduced is not worth it for main stream consumers. And even constellation did not come out of the gate with perfect tracking, so too inside out solutions will improve over time. 

FOV is the elephant in the room right now though, this update must have greater FOV, even if it is only an incremental bump to say 140. Oculus is not operating in a vacuum, the competition is getting tough and they won't always have the best in class touch controllers to bail them out of every argument.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","The point is that computational work is (hopefully) an adequate substitute for trusting a central authority. This is pretty necessary for digital currency, because they have even less objective existence than paper money. (What ""is"" a BitCoin? What does it mean to ""have"" one? Why can't you just Ctrl-C Ctrl-V a single Bitcoin to become an instant quintillionaire?) The idea is that to pull off a fraudulent transaction, you need at least 50% of the computer resources over the *entire* global network. In principle, ""solving made up problems"" provides sonething close to a mathematical proof that the transaction is probably valid. (It's pretty interesting and clever the way it works, honestly. The whole ""mining"" thing is a bad analogy IMO, because what's actually happening is that there is a financial incentive for third parties to spend computing resources to cryptographically verify other random transactions happening elsewhere in the economy. If you cryptographically add a transaction to the blockchain (which is essentially just the entire history of transactions), then you get algorithmically rewarded with BitCoins. Incidentally, this is how money enters the BitCoin economy, as opposed to a central bank issuing notes.) Anyways, I wouldn't say it's pointless anymore than I'd say any form of cryptography is pointless. You're still creating artificial barriers that serve to make it difficult to engage in or cover up deceptive behavior, while preferably putting only a minor burden on legitimate uses. Thus, a *fiat* currency, with mathematics+humanity's entire computational resources, instead of a government, acting as the authority.

_____

That's the idea, at least; whether or not it can deliver is up for debate. (Warning: baseless speculation on technological futures ahead.) For one, as impossible as it sounds, it may be possible to get &gt;50% of the network's computational resources. Namely: use everybody else's computers. E.g., write a virus to use victims' CPUs in the background to create a massive distributed botnet. Or, if you're an ISP, maybe you can nominally cut prices by exchanging background CPU time for Internet access. Websites, or any software, really, could do the same to supplement/replace ad revenue. (The Pirate Bay has started doing this recently, for example.) If giant distributed computing networks under the command of a single entity do indeed start popping up, they'd be prime targets for hackers. Covertly gain control of Xfinity's mining botnet and a bunch of other key targets, and maybe you could effectively gain complete control over the entire global economy.

A more foundational problem that may materialize is the fact that it is not known if one-way functions exist. (One-way functions are, roughly speaking, functions that are computationally easy to compute, but computationally infeasible to compute the inverse of---at least, if you don't have any extra info---in a certain mathematically rigorous sense. It's analogous to physical locks---it's easy to turn an unlocked padlock into a locked one, but not so easy to go the other way, unless you have a key.) Modern cryptographic tools rely heavily, but not exclusively, on functions that computer scientists believe are one-way. But it is an open question in mathematics (closely related to the **P** ?= **NP** question) whether or not *any* functions satisfy this lock-and-key property. The functions we use are easy in one direction and have no known feasible computation in the other direction. If they're wrong and an unknown efficient algorithm does exist for every alleged one-way function, then the BitCoin protocol isn't going to cut it.",1541030535

Tmobile one plus is $15/line for individual lines on the plan, $10/line if all lines get it. So your 3/$140 with free one plus would be cheaper than the 3/$120 plan with one plus added on 2 or 3 lines ($30) making it 3/$150.

Thats because of how uneven the population is since the northern half of our country is very sparsely populated compared to the south. 

And to answer your other question, yes, yes it is. Whenever im assigned to the Northern part of Sweden im the winter im basically just on the phone for the whole day with linemen handing out AMS-permit for hot work banging the thick ice off the lines. And the trees is a problem everywhere but whats challenging is the remoteness in our northern grid. Our northern linemen have to travel very far between faults compared to our southern ones, putting pressure on the blackout times. Our grid is also less flexible up there and is more radially built with fewer options to redirect the current.

In short: North and Yes.

Now we don't need the help and I honestly don't know what we'd do with the money.

I literally spent every waking moment either daydreaming or thinking about my daydreams, and at night I'd stay up until sunrise just sitting in my room daydreaming more. I also filled up notebooks (many, many notebooks) with drawings and notes and memories from my daydreams, much like diaries for my alternate daydream self.

It's not about Soviet apologising it's about misusing a word and ripping it from it's true meaning.

I used to work for a satellite reconnaissance company based out of Tennessee. 12 years ago.

During the Three Wars (Iraq/Afghanistan/Terror) I would sit all day staring at the satellite feed to see any military activity. I'm a geologist by trade. Specializing in Geo-spatial Information Systems.

When IED's got really bad we mapped every culvert (water pipe under roadways) in Iraq and Afghanistan. Perfect for IED placement. Signs were posted at many to warn off anyone to not get close or else they will be killed.

Two kids were throwing a ball and playing in the sewers. In America  a perfectly normal thing. In Helmand Province. Not ok. We dispatched an air strike to kill 'em. Later on in debriefing we used a ""shadow tool"" which measures the shadow a person casts in relation to the satellites angle and the sun's position. It gives us your height more accurately than the birds eye view. The height came back under 3 feet. Fuck those were children (echoed thru the conference room).

Killed a sheep farmer in southern Pakistan. We had been investigating what turned out to be a large farm. Everything pointed to the contrary. He was 2km from the Indian border. Highly suspect and heavily guard on both sides. The Paki's we're using us to monitor the Eastern border while they moved the majority of their army west to protect the border with Afghanistan. Leaving their flank with India unprotected. This guy had built large embankments surrounding his main buildings. Row buildings that we were confident were barracks... in fact held sheep? He had a water tower that from the birds eye we thought was a guard tower of some kind? We recommended a C-17 Recon High Priority Indexing. So what this does is have a C-17 fly to the area under GPS waypoints (while its handling another flight nearby) and map a really small area that I've preset in the plane. The Air Force just bombed the area with the C-17 based off our report. We look at the pictures from the bomber. Dead sheep everywhere. Ridiculous.",1541030544
"StarlightStage","t5_39t20","LG V20 user here. Gameplay is good, and I can FC (80% of the time) and perfect (50% of the time) Master songs up to level 27. Though I sometimes have trouble hitting slides, most likely an issue in my technique. I have no issues with 3D mode, but rich can stutter a tiny bit (probably would be butter smooth if I lower to 1080p). Since the V30 has a better chip, I believe it'll be perfect. As for AR, the V30 is one of the calibrated phones on the list, so you're in luck (the V20 isn't though ;w;) 

The most issues I've had are software. Before on stock, I'd get inconsistent performance and severe throttling. Rooted and installed a custom ROM with a thermal, and performance is amazing. So I recommend you check what people say about the software on the V30, because that's important. I heard it performed miles better and had much longer battery life compared to the V20, so it probably has much better software. (If you're a tinkerer, you can install custom ROMs, but that's a different subject)",1541030544

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Recovering from a ""lower lumbar puncture"" (fancy legal term for spinal tap) and they drained a little too much of your spinal fluid. For those of you who don't know, the fluid that your brain sits in and that works to protect your brain is spinal fluid. So when you have next to no spinal fluid left in your head to act as a barrier between your brain and your skull, your brain becomes open to trauma which results in the worst migraine you'll ever go through in your whole life. It's a migraine that courses through your entire body. Now this is not a normal migraine that can be helped with the assistance of medication, no matter how strong the dosage the doctor prescribes. This migraine lasts for more than a month. 

The first week you can't do anything but take whatever pain meds and whatnot that you're prescribed only to find out that they only help you to sleep through some of the pain but they also cause you to vomit if you try to eat anything. Like I said this migraine is coursing through your whole body, you're laying curled up in fetal position completely drenched in your own sweat because your body feels like it's been put in an oven on broil hi, but you're also freezing as if you've just landed in Antarctica. The entirety of your whole back hurts so bad you can barely breathe, you're shaking so violently you can't even see straight in the moments your body is actually able to pump out what little energy is has left from trying to recover to open your eyes for a brief moment. The pressure in your head leaves you feeling like if you move a muscle your brains are just going to burst from your ears and the ringing will finally stop. 

You feel so weak and helpless. You are unable to take yourself to the bathroom, feed yourself, listen to music or watch tv, nothing, and to try to do any of these things is excruciatingly painful. You think of somehow mustering up any last bits of strength you may have just to off yourself because the pain is so tormenting and it's only been a few hours since leaving the hospital. 

You manage to sleep when the meds kick in but wake the moment they start to wear off as the flood of pain moves back over your body and you're too weak to manage even a whimper. You take more meds, eventually fall back into a restless sleep where you are either too hot or too cold and never comfortable. You continue to sweat profusely and drink nothing but water and Gatorade (to replenish electrolytes) and eating anything that requires chewing instantly feels like a hot knife being twisted in your head.

If you are able to survive the torment for the first week, the next month will be a breeze, with the exception of constant, sharp, painful dizziness any time you move your head; muscle stiffness and joint pain and weakness; not being able to BM for two weeks because it hurts your back and head so much that you pass out on the toilet trying; the fever won't break as your body is still trying to replenish the spinal fluid that was taken, so you continue on in a clammy cold sweat; being so weak and malnourished that you hallucinate constantly and the dense fatigue that settles into your bones makes it difficult to even stay awake for more than a few hours at a time which is fine since you can barely decipher the differences between what's real and what's not anyway.

The nurses warned me though, all of them women, they all told me that recovering from this kind of procedure is 10X worst than natural childbirth. I haven't had any children of my own yet, but I have a strong suspicion that if I can survive recovery from that, I'll be ok having a kid one day.

Then why even use it?

Maybe saying he is culpable is going too far, but he is responsible for creating the culture amongst the trainers and other coaches that led to drills so harsh that they literally killed one of their players.

Since you clearly didn't read the report detailing what UM found, I'll point out an important part for you.

&gt;Both Mr. Durkin and leadership in the Athletics Department share responsibility for the failure to supervise Mr. Court.

Mr. Court was the strength coach at UM, and he oversaw the workout that killed McNair. Durkin hired Court and considered him to be a key asset on his coaching staff. Court reported directly to Durkin, and Durkin did nothing to stop the culture that Court helped to create on his team.

I really suggest you the read the report, or at least the summary. The coaches (including Durkin) did some pretty awful things to their players, including forcing them to watch videos of animals being killed and disparaging players for their weight. Court also forced a player to eat until vomitting, and chocked another player with a lat bar. The player's parents reported it to Durkin, who did nothing about it.

If you really believe that Durkin shares no responsibility for this kid's death, it's because you haven't done the slightest bit of research into what happened during his tenure.",1541030549

"iphone","t5_2qh2b","Firstly, the ""First Mover's Myth"" as spoken about in [OP's image](https://i.redd.it/pgq987q2wdv11.jpg) seems to be misunderstood by almost everyone in this thread. The text book is saying:

* ""Beware entrepreneurs who claim they have a 'first-mover advantage'"" because they think (on principle) that because there is zero competition, they will *outlast the market share* or *continue to stay on top.* It's akin to thinking, 'Because I am 1 mile ahead of the competition, they will never catch up.' The textbook is calling that a ""Myth"" and that you should NOT rest your laurels on being the ""first-mover.""

* The textbook reiterates that point by saying ""most entrepreneurs that make that claim don't understand the nature of their business.""

* It then lists iPhone is a valid example. Why is it valid?

1. Apple was the first-mover in the ""slate smartphone"" product category, owning 100% of that market. 
2. In 2017 [Apple *only* owned 14% of the market.](https://developer.omnis.net/blog/infographic-global-smartphone-sales-market-share-by-vendor-and-os) **So they wen't from 100% to 14% of market share.

So if you're defending OP that the textbook is using a bad example, then I disagree. **Apple starting out at the top did not result in Apple staying at the top. THAT'S THE MYTH!**

Secondly, you say:

&gt; I'm using a comparison to another giant corporation to illustrate just how wrong the OP prophesy is.

And I responded to you why your example is really, really, really bad. Firstly, because Apple and Amazon are not direct competitors. And secondly, because of the reason I stated: Amazon is up there with Apple in financial success, and profit is not indicative of success when your strategic methodology states that profit is useless when money is better spent expanding.

You don't seem to understand why your example was a bad one. I hope I clarified it, but I'm not holding my breath.",1541030551

Before I got the ipad I had bought the surface pro, which seemed like a perfect desktop replacement for school, and had a better pen at the time that magnetized to the side like the new pencil will do (but didn‚Äôt charge that way). After the surface pro froze up on me at crucial moments when I had to share my work in class, etc. I had to immediately switch over the ipad and I haven‚Äôt looked back.

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt;Well I am not sure their real intentions 

And you don't need to be. Regardless of their stated intentions they will necessarily cause a chainsplit. This is a cold hard technical fact. 

&gt;While on the other hand ABC has openly said they own the BCH ticker

I don't agree with any of that stuff about ABC owning the ticker. If they think they do then I disagree and I think it should go to the chain that gets the economy and hence the most PoW. **However**, that doesn't stop people from preferring the minority chain, as I would personally if the largest non-SV chain was the minority, and nowhere in the white paper does it describe who gets to keep a ticker when the chain hardforks.

&gt;So ABC are posturing as they will not follow miner vote. At least on the surface it seems that ABC is more responsible for the split because they have initiated the fork and incompatible rules. Both SV and ABC will be incompatible with the current chain, so its not fair to say only SV is incompatible especially when ABC initiated the rushed fork. I think SV shares some of the responsibility as well, but I also cannot blame them for competing, they really have no choice.

This ""fork they initiated"" is something that nChain and all other developer groups agreed to a long time ago. This was a collaborative decision. That they have backed out and decided to go make their own incompatible client has no bearing on who is causing a split. They had a choice many months ago. They could have made the changes contentious then rather than now when doing so causes maximum drama and disruption.

&gt;Having miners enforce this means it is fair game to attack and reorg and continuously orphan the minority chain in order to kill it off completely, and hopefully this is what will happen in November, whether it is Jihan and his giant hash power, or SV the underdog we will see. But it is important we support the winner whatever the outcome is and avoid a split.

Where on Earth did Satoshi condone a 51% attack as appropriate for honest miners in **any of his writings**. This is among the most preposterous statements I've ever read.",1541030552

&amp;#x200B;

If American gun manufacturers want to make guns then they may legally do so, provided their products comply with stipulated Federal and State laws.

If there are 40 kings (remember that Neshameh was dead-last because of his prodigal status, and forty people is fairly reasonable for an imperial extended family), and each one lasted even a year, that's forty years. In all probability, there were a few that stepped back, rebuilt, and then charged forward.

Most of what people would want to change with race is relatively minor details (on its own, racism makes bigger problems).

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","In all likelihood, as much as I hate to admit this, I think the thalmor could have won. Thalmor strategists come off as much more merciless and they also have highly trained soldiers (not to mention the damned wizards.)

That being said though, I do believe the empire could have put up a huge fight as well, they too have highly trained soldiers and strategists, and a lot more of them due to wider recruitment. Needless to say it would be a bloodbath, with the thalmor likely surviving even if they lost the war. 

The empire would suffer massive consequences in the short and long term for going into this war even if they did win, though. The beauty of the empire is to protect the people of tamriel, and if they didn't sign the concordat, then a strong argument could have been made that they care less for the lives of their people than they do about war. The empire would then grow exceptionally weak, and become even less capable of protecting tamriel, until it likely dissolved, which the thalmor would benefit from. 

So in the end, even if the empire pulled off a huge victory over the thalmor, it appears to me the Thalmor would win in the end anyway.",1541030557

They keep saying ""oh black people are leaving the plantation"" or "" based Hispanics waking up"" and... No. Look at the demographics, and look at how they vote. Why did California go blue and stay that way? Why is Arizona and Texas on the same path? Why would Chicago always vote for the people keeping them poor?

Why are the Democrats for open, limitless immigration as long as they're from non-white countries?

"Parahumans","t5_2x7ww","&gt; the most positive example of a gay relationship in Parahumans is between two villains,""

I know you've backed away from this a bit, but the whole hero/villain thing and the ""unwritten rules"" are a key part of the themes of both Worm (Taylor spends entire arcs agonizing over which group she should fall into, spending time in both and somewhere beteeen) and Ward (the collapse of society has led to the collapse of the rules among everything else, with ongoing struggles around rehabilitation, imprisonment, and what is ""justice"" in such an asymmetrical society). 

Parian and Foil are ""villains"" not because they are evil or sadists seeking personal power, but because they aren't aligned with a government entity and instead have chosen to join with what is something between a rogue government and warlords who are genuinely trying to provide security to the populace of their territory (the Undersiders). 

Another consistent theme is the matter of deciding when to join forces with villains to defeat someone worse - the heroes are generally happy to collaborate with the Undersiders against threats like the Slaughterhouse 9, and *everyone* is basically considered to be allied in events like Endbringer attacks. As part of this theme, many of the ""heroes"" are explicitly worse people than ""villains"", but because they are government or cauldron-aligned, fall into that category in their public description.

It's less a matter of Good vs. Evil and more something like Lawful vs. Chaotic, with the relationships between the more legitimate villain entities like the Undersidere and the hero groups being closer to the one between rival sports teams - they'll beat each other up occasionally if business calls for it, but otherwise they're not particularly out to destroy each other.

To build a road, a contractor will first excavate to sub-grade, which is the dirt bottom (in terms of thickness) of the road. Next, a 6‚Äù-10‚Äù layer of aggregate stone is installed on top of the sub-grade. Then, contractors will add a layer of asphalt often called ‚ÄúB Mix‚Äù. To a layman, B Mix asphalt generally looks like regular asphalt, so it‚Äôs reasonable to wonder why they‚Äôre not done, but B Mix is actually just a rough pre-Mix asphalt applied for strength and protection. Contractors often make installation of B Mix a major goal in a project, because B Mix provides a number of benefits. So at this point, road builders might start focusing on other tasks, leaving questions like yours. But finally, when the project is 80-85% complete, the contractor will lay the last 2‚Äù or so of ‚ÄúFinal Surface‚Äù or ‚ÄúA Mix‚Äù. The road is now complete and just needs all the paint striping. 

TL;DR: you may just be seeing the B Mix and the project isn‚Äôt done yet. ",1541030558

I don‚Äôt consider THAT too absurd if we‚Äôre using Jay Cutlers $10 Mil deal for someone on the verge of retirement. 

I‚Äôm just saying, by trying Kaep out, one way or the other it would help end the debate of why he isn‚Äôt playing.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","It really isn't impossible... I did it by sleeping a LOT less and doing my hw in easier classes like AP World, World lit, and AP Lang... (BTW I'm not good at english/humanities in anyway, I just had easy teachers/my school makes these classes really easy)
I had Cross Country practice during the fall and Track during the spring and they average about 2-3 hrs after school everyday so thats about 15 hrs. I worked 20-25hrs a week (I would usually stuff 11/12 hr shifts into saturdays and sundays) and then I would work one day of the week right after practice. Sometimes I would take a day off of work to study for tests, but I mostly kept to my schedule and ngl it was ROUGH. I would break down on my way home from work pretty regularly (it's 30mins from my house so I would just cry then). 

BTW my schedule was
AP World, AP Lang, AP Gov, Honors Physics, Honors Precalc, World Lit, and Spanish 4.

Idk this is just my two cents on the subject, IK it seems impossible and you don't have to believe me but... it's possible and it sucks. My attendance was really bad last year because I just couldn't get out of bed, or I had an upcoming quiz/test and really needed to study for it.

&gt; if we have come to that conclusion based upon the concept without knowing its execution, our conclusion stands a good chance of being wrong.

The only thing that has kept Babymetal afloat this year, and even winning some new fans, is the past catalog and the performances of Su, Moa and the Kamis. You will have many difficulties to find many people who prefer these shows over for example FFF last year.

I havent used Loud Speaker Kit. I have visited the website a few times for a gander.

Here is Australia we do get the raw end of the stick with some speaker parts but there is still enough here to play with also some of the exotic drivers are still available if you ask the distributors. 

I have floorstanders I'm making right now for a friend they are an MTM style with two 6.5"" woofers and a dual ring radiator tweeter. I used Jantzen Silver Z Caps on the tweeter and they sound beautiful. I actually think I prefer them to my Kef Ci5160rl-thx reference in wall speakers, even though they are 5k a speaker. When I installed the kefs I gave them a good looking over and the parts they use in the crossover really do amaze me. All I could see was cheap inductors and bennic electrolytic caps. 

I'm probably going to sell the kefs and build new speakers with Beryllium tweeters and highend woofers and mundorf caps. As for inductors and resistors I'm yet to notice any gains on the sound front for the price. Caps on the other hand are expensive but they make the speaker what they are. 

When I go to build the final cabinets for my friends MTM I might make a video for you. Only thing is that build will be cut with a cnc router. 

Thanks again for the support, feel free to ask me any questions on my YouTube channel and I will get back to you asap in most cases.

I use my Airpods on an Android phone and the music does stop, like you want.

Apple probably looked at the two use cases and thought - let's go with continuous play because they can always press Stop or ask Siri if they really want to stop. So, just tell Siri before you pull them out - don't need to pull out the phone then.

*****
&gt; A Chinese national who helped tens of thousands of citizens jump over China&amp;#039;s Great Firewall has been forced to flee to the United States over fears for his family&amp;#039;s safety.

&gt; The Chinese people used technologies, such as virtual private networks, to climb over the Great Firewall and access sites that were blocked by the Government.

&gt; After President Xi Jinping assumed power, the Chinese Government devoted more resources to control online content and began to crack down on VPNs. Mr Zou&amp;#039;s tutorials began training Chinese users in alternative encrypted proxy projects such as Shadowsocks and ShadowsocksR. &amp;quot;Because the Communist Party of China keeps changing course in how it blocks the information network, I try to find more convenient ways to climb over the wall,&amp;quot; Mr Zou said.

When I'm in a foul mood -- it's very very hard for me to kick myself out of it. I'm completely aware when I am in that mood and what sucks is I feel like everything is an attempt to provoke me and I equate myself to a rabid animal in a cage. I just get very bitter and if not left alone, I can say some seriously hateful things. Attempts to help me get out of it just end up annoying me, even though I can see that someone is just doing their best. When I get in those modes, I try to isolate myself until I kick myself out of it, but sometimes I'm out with friends or at work, and it can be a complete drag. They happen pretty rarely, but when they do, it's noticeable.
 
What sucks even more about it - is that it's hard for me to be honest about it. It's not that I can't be honest about who I am. It's that any other time that I am justifiably upset about something, 9 times out of 10, people will just say ""Oh, you're just in that mood"". No, I'm sincerely upset with you and I'm expressing it as an adult, and you're completely undermining me now that I've been vulnerable about a different part of myself that can happen from time to time.

FWIW, I got my first Playboys the same way. 

I got it in my head that nipping on that bottle gave me some tolerable warmth as I sipped it away through the remainder of the winter - I kept it in the bottom of my paper bag; nobody ever would've thought to look for anything there. 

A few years later somebody was passing around a bottle of Jack, and I thought ""Close, but not quite right ... "" Later on I discovered that Scotch was a thing of its own, and I've always had a warm place in my heart, so to speak, and a taste for it in particular (not that I'll turn down bourbon or anything).

I've been one of those people who can't get full-time work (not related to the energy industry) yet I've never felt like the ""tax on everything"" has even come close to crippling me.

So what else... maybe focusing too much on the crappy candidates the UCP are putting up? I don't like their Facebook ads that talk about how Kenney and the UCP want to out gay children.

"Gundam","t5_2sjr4","&gt;Potentially no, remember that the Gundam at Side-7 was the RX-78-2 the RX-78 was already completed and they had begun production of the RX-78\[G\] as soon as it was tested. That meant there were already Ground Types being worked on

A grand total of less then thirty of them, and none would be used off Earth and more then half would be used for parts.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  GMs would still be mass produced

And without the Combat data from the 78/2 and its learning computer data to produce the needed technical tweaks and information, not to mention actually be the foundation for their simulation programs they'd be probably significantly less impressive.

\&gt;   the Federation already had access to Beam Rifle Tech from the original Prototype.

True, but Zeon would likely get it far sooner now given they just captured the 78, Luna T, Beam Tech, Zeon's technological win from this beats out the Federation's significantly

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  means the Gelgoogs might never have been made and the GM already was the superior weapons system to the Zaku.

That's a leap and a half considering that both the Gouf and Dom were prototyping in September.

*****
&gt; A Chinese national who helped tens of thousands of citizens jump over China&amp;#039;s Great Firewall has been forced to flee to the United States over fears for his family&amp;#039;s safety.

&gt; The Chinese people used technologies, such as virtual private networks, to climb over the Great Firewall and access sites that were blocked by the Government.

&gt; After President Xi Jinping assumed power, the Chinese Government devoted more resources to control online content and began to crack down on VPNs. Mr Zou&amp;#039;s tutorials began training Chinese users in alternative encrypted proxy projects such as Shadowsocks and ShadowsocksR. &amp;quot;Because the Communist Party of China keeps changing course in how it blocks the information network, I try to find more convenient ways to climb over the wall,&amp;quot; Mr Zou said.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt; If you got a large farm, and I got nothing and I seek employment. Who has the stronger hand? You.

This is false; If I have a farm that needs workers, i must find a worker i can afford or else my farm goes to ruin. The workers can move freely, and take whatever job offers the best return. Noone has the upper hand.

&gt; You. If trying to influence a group of people on a political or legal decision. Who has most influence

If politicians have no power to sell, noone.

Dont let evil in your heart; envy is just envy, and it is nothing good.

&gt;      You are rambling. This makes no sense. 

Think harder. Noone owes you food just because you are alive. Nature is not a person who is oppressing you by making you hungry. You being hungry is not an excuse to steal from others.  those are just facts; simple hard and irrefutable. 

&gt; option of leaving a country or not working there. It is simple.

That is false; there is no such option in any realistic sense. 

&gt; Nobody knows what capitalism without a state looks lik

The early USA and medieval iceland come closest, as societies. With modern technology we havent seen much pure capitalism lately. On a small scale, any unreported trade without taxes is capitalism. On In the nation known as the internet, free software is a capitalist economy.

&gt; If you think a crime is being committed against you, why are you not taking up arms and refusing to pay? 

Well, we are taking up arms; americans by and large are nto shy to own small arms. Actively fighting the government is a different thing;  and arguable fruitless because the result of violence is rarely an ideal anarchy but instead a new and worse form of socialism. (Napoleon rising from the ashes of the french revolution, for example)

Instead, we work towards a peaceful revolution. Speaking logically with people to spread the truth is one part of it. New technology, such as the internet, free software, and bitcoin are the main tools of peaceful revolution.

&gt; Take America today, as it stands. How are you going to get to your Utopia? Be specific. 

Probably with a world wide hyperbitcoinization. I dont see it working too well if isolated to one country. Unless a majority of the world's tyrants find themselves unable to raise an military with a debt bubble, then its probably not stable to have just one nation be anarchist.  Some foreign king with a powerful military would just topple them, as happened to medieval iceland.

&gt; Which is why any health democracy needs to limit the power of the rich.

Laughable naivete.  In a democracy the rich will be those who are in power; by definition they will be the foxes in charge of the henhouse. Do you really expect all positions of power to be filled by selfless angels? Do you not see how fairly-tale logic doesnt work in real life?

All taxes flow from the poor to the rich, and it will always be that way so long as taxes exist.

&gt; Yet you believe this system should be imposed on everybody else

""Imposing freedom"", is that so bad? You know, you can still *choose* to pay taxes even if freedom is imposed upon you, did you know that? What would be missing, and what you fear, is that other people who are not willing to would not pay them. 

Basitat has a good quote about this:

&gt; ""The state is the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at the expense of everyone else.""

And the emotions put into this are great; so much so that I would love to give it a try, if I was just a bit more confident I could pull it off.


I do have a question about the ""structure"" of the script:


Is it correct that you are aiming for an audio where sounds of the ""action"" act as a sort of backdrop to the narrator? Like, the character tells his story, but some events are ""brought to life"" by applying sounds of whatever is happening in the moment?


I'm asking because, while I recall listening to audios that took this approach, I haven't encountered a script that dealt with this idea before. I find it very interesting.


Of course, if I have completely missed the point of your vision, then I do apologize!",1541030580

Why not just have the government cover all mortgages and rental agreements up to a certain amount? Why not have all food be free and everyone gets a ration card? Also basic expenses vary based on who you are talking to. I have had people explain why internet,tv, and phone should be covered as well. Also what is basic? What does that even mean. It is an extremely vague term that people would surely take advantage of. You could also ad healthcare and transportation to the list of basic needs. So does everyone get a free car? The issue for me is that this just doesnt work no matter how many times you try it. Basic in NYC would be a hell of a lot more than basic in Oklahoma. So than you would have to determine who gets what at how much and if it's fair to give people live in a more expensive area more money. There are just a lot of if's and no real solutions.",1541030580

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","Somewhat of an exaggeration, but the sub would say otherwise, when Vivi USB was basically one of the ""go to"" relic picks for our first USB Dream Select in GL.

Most people wouldn't use Palom or Vivi without their USBs (I know some did with Vivi, cause his LM2 is a 50% W-Cast), mostly cause a lot wouldn't dive them without, which removes one of their potent features.

And yes, everyone you listed can dive into another school for more tech. But that would be why Vivi and Palom are the ""de-facto"" Black Mages - They cannot do anything else.

* Fire - Krile, Terra, Braska (prefers Summons), Papalymo (who cannot offense outside of Black either, and has no Ability Double USB), and Ace
* Ice - Rinoa, Edea (USB2 is Ice-focused, not Witch), Serah
* Wind - Barbariccia, Fujin, Ultimecia, Alphinaud (who'd rather Summon)
* Earth - Maria, Emperor, Rydia (prefers Summons), Rinoa, Enna Kros (if we ever get fortunate enough)
* Lightning - Desch (god that USB is old and lackluster), Reno (kinda prefers Machinist?), Garnet (prefers Summons), Shantotto (prefers Witch), Ashe
* Water - Meia, Rydia (prefers Summons), Gogo (V), Strago, Lulu (her USB and AOSB upcoming are Ice/Water and the USB is a +Water Doll)
* Fire/Ice/Lightning - Matoya (even as she wishes Fire Witch spells existed so her LM2 and LMR could matter for her DPS, and the Quick Cycle on her USB...)
* Fire/Water/Earth/Wind - Onion Knight USB3

And yet, excluding Terra's brand new AASB (and the only actual Black Magic one so far), none of these above people can really shine outside of their given element(s). If you take out all the ones that have schools they are more specialized to (Summon and Witch), you wind up with 2-5 per element. And yet, in ANY of these 6 elements (and even Bio, for when it matters?), Vivi and Palom will happily slot into any of these teams without even a second thought if you have their USB, cause it's not about the entry/EnElem for them, it's the Ability Double + W-Cast. You check the headlining people for DPS, and it's all Doublers, many with W-Casts as well.

* Orlandeau
* Gau (even if one of the schools is mostly token)
* Vivi
* Palom
* Shantotto (despite lacking the W-Cast, she has the riskier T-Cast LMR. Also she has the speed tech to make Witch work built into her Trance, unlike Edea, who lacks a W-Cast or Speed)
* Tifa
* Celes
* Others I am likely forgetting...

The biggest thing is, there is no Ability Double + W-Cast users with the range that Vivi and Palom have. They do hold the crown of their school for good cause. Even as they make us cry over our crippled orb supplies... A fact that as of today, I am now having to realize as I got Vivi's USB off my IX Realm pull.",1541030580
"DotaConcepts","t5_2yu26","Overall, it's definitely a pretty solid concept. More solid than what it first seem to be. The combos work and you know dota's numbers well enough. Astolfo have a feel of a traditional dota hero: the abilities are not perfectly synergistic but everything is cohesive enough to make every spell works. Probably the only problem I have around his general playstyle is his mana issues. Also, he has no talents? 

**Shield Breaker** has too small of a range per second channeling. 200 means that it's pretty much equivalent to having 200 movement speed and that is very slow, you will never hit anyone who can see you. 

Suggestion : Distance per second channeling to 500. **Shield Breaker** now has hidden ability **Unleash**, which only appears even he's channeling. He must press it again to properly dash. This means that getting interrupted will waste the ability. It allows for counterplay and ways for Astolfo to cancel the command.

Can we put some internal cooldown in-between **Valor** strikes? Being able to instant-cast this 3 times means that a 150 damage Astolfo deals 660 dmg with this ability in an INSTANT! Note the word 'instant'. It's okay if it's like over the course of 5 seconds like Bladefury. So how about it, 1s internal cooldown?

This is just me talking, but I would rather nerf the crit multiplier for a reduced mana cost on **Valor**. I see her as someone who builds attack and strength items but the 210 mana cost will ruin her momentum. (50 mana, -0.2 to all crit) Or actually, you can just buff his int stat to 21 + 2.5 or something. 

I know the slow is there as a deterrent from making the spell powerful and all. But something about **Charm** that scales the slow up doesn't sit right with me. With the kind of displacement it has, A constant 20% slow in all lvls should do it. 

**Hippogryph** has so much mana cost for a hero with a sad int growth. And it's not a clash-deciding ult like Chronosphere or Omnislash either. Though the flying vision is probably the strongest effect it has. Batrider is balanced around the fact that he only has 1200/800 vision. And every other flying vision effects get reduced values. Aghs are a different story tho. Try giving it 150 mana all levels and reducing Astolfo's day vision. 

I too, make hero concepts based around [anime characters](https://www.dotafire.com/dota-2/forum/hero-and-item-ideas/nitori-kawashiro-touhou-hero-concept-105781) (except touhou is not an anime) so you don't have to be embarrassed about it.

&gt;We report the detection of continuous positional and polarization changes of the compact source SgrA* in high states (‚Äúflares‚Äù) of its variable near-infrared emission with the near-infrared GRAVITY-Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) beam-combining instrument. In three prominent bright flares, the position centroids exhibit clockwise looped motion on the sky, on scales of typically 150¬†Œºas over a few tens of minutes, corresponding to about 30% the speed of light. At the same time, the flares exhibit continuous rotation of the polarization angle, with about the same 45(¬±15) min period as that of the centroid motions. Modelling with relativistic ray tracing shows that these findings are all consistent with a near face-on, circular orbit of a compact polarized ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù of infrared synchrotron emission at approximately six to ten times the gravitational radius of a black hole of 4 million solar masses. This corresponds to the region just outside the innermost, stable, prograde circular orbit (ISCO) of a Schwarzschild‚ÄìKerr black hole, or near the retrograde ISCO of a highly spun-up Kerr hole. The polarization signature is consistent with orbital motion in a strong poloidal magnetic field.",1541030583

"desabafos","t5_395lw","Tenho o  mesmo problema. Realmente √© foda se sentir assim, ultimamente tenho tomado algumas atitudes que tem ajudado um pouco, s√£o passos pequenos mas j√° me sinto melhor. N√£o sei se funciona para voc√™ mas para mim est√° melhorando. 

Arrumei um emprego, atendimento ao cliente.. Pode n√£o ser l√° aquelas coisas mas s√≥ o fato de se ""obrigada"" a interagir com pessoas est√° me ajudando a me abrir mais para novas amizades. Acho que tem ajudado com a fobia social por estar lidando com pessoas o dia inteiro. 

Me matriculei em uma academia. Tento ir todos os dias depois do trabalho, sempre odiei exerc√≠cios mas isso me obriga a sair do quarto e fazer algo. Al√©m disso, minha disposi√ß√£o aumentou, n√£o me conformo mais em ficar deitada na cama por horas. 

Comecei a fazer um curso de orat√≥ria e de intelig√™ncia emocional, acho important√≠ssimo conhecer seus traumas e como isso afeta suas cren√ßas a respeito de si mesmo e do que voc√™ √© capaz. 

Al√©m disso, mesmo quando estou trabalhando em algo no computador, tento mudar de ambiente, as vezes vou em um caf√© ou em uma biblioteca, assim evito procrastinar e fico mais focada no que preciso fazer. 

Enfim, a vida n√£o est√° uma maravilha mas essas pequenas a√ß√µes tem me motivado para me tornar uma pessoa mais social. Espero que ajude.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","however, everyone pays sales tax in some way or another and many state budgets count on various vat taxes.  It will be difficult to collect through income taxes, however if you do it through a vat tax it is more likely to work.  Andy Yang who is a businessman running for President in 2020 [https://samharris.org/podcasts/130-universal-basic-income/](https://samharris.org/podcasts/130-universal-basic-income/)   in this interview at about the 53 min mark he describes the estimated cost and how to pay for it.   


 The estimated $1000 per month UBI for all US Citizens 18 -64 would cost about $1.5 trillion (this excludes welfare, food stamps and disability funding on which there could be further savings)  So the tax would fund about 2/3rds, also due to the multiplier effect and growth of GDP there is a revenue to GDP ratio of 25% will add another 250-500billion in increased tax revenues. Additionally there would be a savings of billions on health care, drug rehab, homelessness prisons etc (which are quite costly).    


The other stat to look at is the increased amount population on disability benefits, I believe it has doubled in the past 25 years - as something like 25% of older men end up on disability when manufacturing jobs go with factory closures. (When a paper mill in Aberdeen washington closed, many of the former workers were advised to go on disability)   


 If you are on disability benefits you are far less likely to take on other work (even volunteering) because of the risk of losing those benefits.  This is where UBI would be a better fit, and would help fund people to relocate elsewhere where there is work. If everyone gets it there is no stigma attached, (sort of like with pensions, that was a relatively new thing introduced by Bismarck).       


Finally those who oppose it on the basis of ""something for nothing"" , should also oppose inheritances because that is also ""something for nothing"".  For that matter plenty of private sector has received government handouts, and not just with the financial collapse bailout but even going back to the 19th century, the Railway magnates received as much free land (about 9% of the continental US, or the area of California and Montana combined).

If she's coming to your place after being at school or work have dinner ready or almost ready. Find out when she's coming over and make it to where dinner is going to be ready about 15 to 20 minutes after she gets there.

Now if she wasn't doing anything that day like let's say she is off. Then you can cook dinner together make sure it's something light and fun and not too labor-intensive cuz remember she's got a early morning and you don't want to tire her out before you get to the main event of the evening ;-)

As for the movie/ show, nothing too intense where you have to follow the narrative really hard. An adventure movie, rom-com, or a light horror movie are usually pretty good. Any of the Marvel movies are good idea mainly because they're good movies and will keep you interested if things are going well. but you also don't have to pay attention to hard if you guys get snuggly.

&gt; 7:56 PM ET. The University of Maryland has fired football coach DJ Durkin one day after his reinstatement, the school announced Wednesday evening.

&gt; &amp;quot;Since returning to campus after yesterday&amp;#039;s press conference, I have met with the leadership of the Student Government Association speaking on behalf of numerous student organizations; the Senate Executive Committee; Deans; department chairs; and campus leadership. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders expressed serious concerns about Coach DJ Durkin returning to the campus.""

&gt; &amp;quot;The chair of the Board of Regents has publicly acknowledged that I had previously raised serious concerns about Coach Durkin&amp;#039;s return. This is not at all a reflection of my opinion of Coach Durkin as a person. However, a departure is in the best interest of the University, and this afternoon Coach Durkin was informed that the University will part ways.""

My advise to you, join more CCAs, make it a habit to adopt a healthy lifestyle (sleep early and excercise) and just talk to people. Well maybe not random strangers on trains but the person seating at the desk beside you or infront of you. Ask them about their weekend and what they did and just listen.

Your raw query returns a Cursor object. If I'm understanding this API correctly, you need to get the column index of your playerID column and call the getInt method on that to return that value of the playerID from the Cursor object. This may be a roundabout way, so someone with more experience in this domain could tell you of a more efficient path.

Also, your raw query looks a little strange. I'd expect you to be able to keep it in a single string. `""SELECT key_player_id FROM players_table WHERE key_player_first_name = , null`

Then after the equals you can put your argument like you've done, or set it to a ? and pass in FirstName to the rawQuery as an argument which I believe is valid.

Also don‚Äôt stake two sources on top of the others like their one.

Part IV page 434

Right because when have a discussion on the moral ethics of a king god we should totally be historically accurate and make sure we don‚Äôt mix fake people like the Amazons with real people like the Trojans.

Your using whataboutism again yes other Greek Gods did horrible things but that doesn‚Äôt take away from how horrible Zeus and how much more horrible he is then the rest.
Also the flood was his choice alone.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deucalion

Also Shinto Aztec and Egyptian All Don‚Äôt have a flood story.

You say that Hitler should be responsible for what he ordered to do yet you refuse to hold Zeus responsible for things he personally did and keep making excuses for him. You act like only the people Zeus is in charge of are to blame and refuse to accept that even if he wasn‚Äôt in charge he would be the worse and most evil god. The fact that he‚Äôs in charge only makes it worse since it him privileges  greater than anyone when he is more evil then anyone. The fact that he‚Äôs the leader doesn‚Äôt make him worse it‚Äôs just a insult.

You are an uneducated moron the fact that I got vocabulary fact wrong doesn‚Äôt nothing to change that. You make wild claims that the others gods raped hundreds of people red refuse to back them up. You constantly try to avoid Zeus taking responsibility using whataboutism and dismissing the fact that his crimes are horrendous by picking on details that take nothing away from the horror of his evil like how eating his wife wasn‚Äôt technically canalbalism. Not only do you get stuck on topics that have nothing to do with the argument like Sparta‚Äôs patreon god but you also use a reason to disregard one argument like Amazons not being real only to not care about that reason when a point that benefits you comes up like the Troy.

You are so biased towards Zeus that you can see any crime he committed without trying to compare it to another god trying to convince others that they are worse.

"speedrun","t5_2sf9e","&gt;why would you want to speedrun a game you dont own for a console you dont have

The point is that some versions of games running on certain consoles have advantages over others. I might only have the means to buy a game one time on one console. I play and love the game, and it turns out that after a bunch of practice and hard work, I actually am the very best at the game. I set the world record with a near flawless run, with tons of frame perfect tricks, etc. My record stands at 42mins 3secs. Every frame perfect trick I made saves 5secs off the time, and I completed 20 of them, saving 100secs over the previous world record which had 0 of them.

You see my score on the leaderboard and want to play the same game, but you have access to a bunch of money and know that the Brazilian version of the game running on a console with a weird SKU that was only in production for a few months saves about 120secs in load times. You buy that version and that console on Ebay for $500 then record yourself playing. You do not complete any of the frame perfect tricks that I completed, losing on the 100secs they save, and you made a couple of other mistakes, costing you 19secs more. 

Congratulations, you are now the world record holder by 1sec and sit atop the leaderboard for the game, despite the fact that I played better in every single way.

So, I then load up the game on emulator which runs the same as the Brazilian version, play through it again and regain my world record by 119secs but it's invalid because ""emulators provide an advantage"". You still have the official record because I can't afford to spend $500.",1541030586

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;No, I take no offense at his religion, and neither does Sanders HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THAT, CAN YOU EVEN READ!!; only at his personal belief that he uses religion to justify, see the difference? I do not see how it is possible for a person who refuses to say a religious test to employment is OK (which Vought did do, and justified that firing with his condemnation of all Muslims) to be a office holder that is in charge of hiring and firing an entire dept.

You can't make a distinction between someone's nominal religion and their particular religious convictions. At the time of writing, everyone would have been nominally Christian, with only their particular convictions and denomination associations to cause distinctions. This is precisely the kind of discrimination that this rule was designed to prevent. Religious tolerance means tolerating people, even if you actually disagree with them. 

The Constitution says that it is illegal to use religious beliefs as a basis for considering a person for public office, but it's perfectly legal to do so for a position in a religious institution, for obvious reasons. These are not remotely comparable. It's well established that a religious institution can use religious beliefs as a basis for employment.

&gt;When? Show me an example or a quote.

""I understand that you are a Christian. But this country is made up of people who are not just‚ÄîI understand that Christianity is the majority religion. But there are other people who have different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?""

So clearly, Sanders gets the difference between Vought condemning someone, and believing that God will condemn him. 

‚ÄúI would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who is what this country is supposed to be about,‚Äù Sanders said. ‚ÄúI will vote no.‚Äù

So, this isn't some specific concern about his ability to execute his office impartially, this is voting no on the basis that Vought has religious convictions that aren't, ""what this country is supposed to be about"".

Sanders wants to preventing them from entering office for have the ""wrong"" theological beliefs. It's not different at all from a Protestant saying that a Roman Catholic shouldn't serve in office, because a majority of the country is offended by Roman Catholic views. (This was a thing at one point.)

Honestly, a much more compelling argument would to to say that a ""religious test"", must be institutional and is not binding on a confirmation vote. I don't know the case law well enough to say one way or another about that. Either way, it's still bigoted on Sander's part.

* Combat styles interface image is ugggly since it's isolated without the stone pane around it
* 10/10 activities table, they are like a checklist. Not sure about the individual ones tho since I have to read them all.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Imo ""selling drops for money"" is a lazy solution that has ""worked"" for so long that designers simply haven't bothered to reexamine it. It has major upsides in that players can intuitively learn to farm enemies for drops to sell, and it's almost entirely up to them how much grinding for it they want to do. It's also easy to implement (they're already gonna code enemy drops, all you need is to assign a sell value to them) and easy to balance (just tweak sell values and drop frequency).

The thing is, it reduces the wealth-gaining system to yet another do-until-you-have-enough-then-forget mechanic. At some point in the game the player will have enough money to not bother with grinding anymore, and they immediately lose all (wealth-based) motivation for it. Players can also double dip on abusing parallel systems e.g. crafting: make 100 daggers = skill gain + sell for loot. Doesn't help immersion when you revisit a vendor and see they're still sporting the 100 daggers you pawned off on them, nevermind them being a bottomless source of money.

Getting rid of this can actually help fix other things. Say vendors no longer buy drops (because how does a vendor living in the ass end of nowhere have enough money) - but instead, the player earns money from quests. Instead of getting throwaway trash (""I did this quest but all I got was a lame sword, I can craft better ones""), give them money instead. Now with quests suddenly being a lot more important since they've just become a main source of money, double down on that by tying it with faction rep. If you keep massacring all the town guards maybe, just maybe, there are actual consequences, and with a crappy rep with the town you get locked out of the higher tier quests (which also likely pay better, not to mention give access to other questlines). The player also gets to choose whether he'd side with faction A because they pay decently and are friendly with more other factions, compared to faction B who have more lucrative quests but don't give much rep, compared to faction C which gives the most pay but they're scumbags and helping them would tank the player's rep against many other factions, compared to faction D which pays peanuts but builds rep with most other factions.

Now questing can be important again, players get to make decisions on which faction to help - *meaningful* decisions, instead of ""should I grind at X location or Y location? X has better loot potential but Y is easier"". To deal with the drops which have no immediate other use, the game's crafting system could fix this: say the player kills a bunch of bandits and loots their ill-fitting crappy armor. Since they can't sell it, it's basically useless. So why not feed the crafting system: depending on how good the character is at it, they can reduce all that junk to scrap and components, to be used in crafting. There, done, there's still use to be gained from it, the player no longer needs to lug around shit just to sell to NPCs, quests can be more meaningful since the rewards are now a main source of wealth. Win-win all around. Of course, it takes a lot of effort on the part of the designers now that they can't simply load up random towns with poorly-written fetchquests, but I consider that a win for players.",1541030591

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","Garlic in oil poses a botulism risk because having only oil with the garlic creates an anaerobic (low or no oxygen) and non-acidic environment. And the botulism grows best in anaerobic and non-acidic environments. So when the CDC talks about oils infused with garlic or herbs, they're talking about oils that contain just garlic, or just herbs. Not oil plus lots of other ingredients like a salad dressing.

This is because adding ingredients that change the environment help reduce/remove the botulism risk. The lemon juice in your dressing is probably sufficient to prevent botulism growth (disrupts the anaerobic environment, is very acidic). An oil based salad dressing with garlic and acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar would typically be fine in refrigerated storage for a few days.

If you're storing the minced garlic alone in oil overnight, then you would want to exercise caution. Again, botulism is something that grows, so merely placing garlic in olive oil does not instantly ""cause"" botulism. It needs time to grow. We cannot judge the growth time accurately in the home environment, so you should definitely take caution with any preparation of only oil and garlic. Always make fresh, eat shortly after preparation or if storing, store for the very limited time that the CDC recommends or less and in proper refridgeration. And remember, they say you can ""reduce botulism"" which is different than eliminate completely. So it's up to you to decided what risk you are willing to take.

That said, last year he was lethal with a pass, this year he seems like he takes his time picking his pass ‚Äì which he did before just now he doesn't find his target anymore. He also gets dispossessed more when trying cut backs and generally is less tidy on the ball. I wholly expect him to get phased out next year.

The damage, although it doesn't look like much, is exactly what sniper needs at precisely the time that he needs it.

That being said I still love the CDR talent as later in the game it is quite impactful and way more fun than just a boring +damage.

The HiBearNating Bag was definitely introduced by the New Game dub, though.

Another great one was in the Gamers! dub.  In the original, Amano is told to introduce himself to Hoshinomori, but in the dub he's told to ""break the ice"" with her.

The bad news, I also lost strength. Whether it was the shoulder or the time off, my bench got set back 20 pounds. 

I come back and have a bod pod test. Not the smartest idea after vacation but whatever, i need a baseline. All bad news. My bf% is 5 points higher than i was guessing. 

I did add 20 pounds to my deadlift, but scraped my shins raw in the process. 

And now i start lifting again and, oh the major DOMS after 3 weeks off. Nothing better than wincing to get off the toilet after leg day. F this whole week.

But at least the shoulder is better. I tell myself it doesn't matter in the long run bc it's not like I don't keep pushing the weight up anyway, I'll get back to where I was and surpass it, blah blah blah.

"Competitiveoverwatch","t5_34fcy","As I said in my comment on the Contenders announcement thread, it's not meant to stop KR player development but rather it's a type of population control as savory as that sounds. Decrease the number of avenues for potential viable KR pros therefore producing a smaller player pool for OWL scouts to pickup. It's sad that Blizzard had to resort to this sort of thing but it's what happens when you have a dominant region that Blizzard don't find ""marketable"". Might you, I think EU will be severely affected as well since they are also an ""exporting"" region.

My only question now is if Korea is still part of the Pacific region or not. Because technically Korea was part of the Pacific region, that's why we had actual Korean orgs (different from just imported rosters) running teams in PAC. I actually thought that was the biggest issue in PAC, not the imported rosters but that Korean orgs can run in two regions, PAC and KR. 

And to be fair, PAC was actually the only region where there was a large mass invasion of KR pros. It's not that bad in other regions actually if you look at the player base. So all these changes would be moot if KR orgs can still run teams in PAC. I've always thought that would have been a better solution, clarify which countries are part of what region and then make sure only local orgs run teams in said regions.

"morbidquestions","t5_37wph","I am not refusing to look at the reality. I've made other comments in this same thread, and while I dont expect you to read them, you'd see that I dont want ABA to be a sole treatment for autistic people. ABA, how it is currently being taught this semester and how I will be using it, and how it should be used, is a way to identify why behavior happens when the person cannot communicate their why. 

I dont think stimming is a behavior that should be stifled. ABA would be a strategy to figure out why that stim happens. So rather than someone going ""I just dont understand them when they get like this!"" the view should be ""what are they communicating about what just happened, or what is going to happen"". 

And positive punishment should never be used. It has no place in treatments, imho. I'm not denying that it happens though. That would be like denying medical malpractice when we know it happens. 

It's baffling to me that my professor is in the minority of teachers and therapists. She has said that when helping clients, you meet them where they are - if we want communication, WE need to step back and learn how they are communicating and what the message is, not force them to speak. (And she stressed that these are not levels of communication since that implies gross inferiority, when we wouldn't say someone conversing in French isnt speaking on a different level.)

I apologize for upsetting anyone. I am not seeking out autistic people to be my clients, nor will I if I follow that path. My answer should have been more along the lines of ""if the person/s seeking help is autistic, then yes I would help them"". However, knowing what I know about autism, I would never us it to force someone to stop stimming or use positive punishment since those are entirely harmful in the long run. Or at least that is what my answer would be now.

If by current definition that means I am no longer practicing ABA, then I am not. And I'm probably not being trained in it ""properly"" either. Using ""adversives"" causes harm (short or long term) and is counterintuitive imho. There are many studies that show this and any practicing medical professional worth their license knows that they harm the individual.",1541030598

&gt; just judging from what you said about your home life, this may be the first time people have been genuinely worried about you when you did something like this. 

You're very right about that. I could tell my parents or childhood friends that I was going off into the woods for a few days, when I was fairly young, like 13 or 14, and I'd just get an ""Alrighty"" or ""Cool, have fun"" 

And then going to college, it was a total culture shock... When people like my roommates or RA expressed worry about me, just going about my life, I took it as an insult. It seemed infantilizing and disrespectful... I was always like ""WTF, you don't think I'm able to get myself to the library at night, and back by myself? I'm a grown ass adult.""

But out of those, the goalies injuries (multiple) were the most harmful to them, they were completely lost. With Crawford a confirmed starter tonight, they are definitely more on the side of grabbing a win than a loss. The team in all is still resourceful enough without Kane if compared to the Canucks, they are just generally better, and assuming they maintain their current status of being healthy, they should not only be on top of the Canucks by a big margin this year, but actually clench a playoff spot as well. Why is that the case? Answer: Joel -the monster- Quenneville. He has been coaching the Blackhawks for 10 years which is an accomplishment on its own, only skipped last year without getting them into the playoffs and that was for very obvious reasons (every player was injured), and won them the Stanley cup 3 freaking times.

He was high on the ballots. The first two Golden Suns, they could‚Äôve been Nintendo‚Äôs staple JRPG. But then Nintendo had Camelot do their sports games, and those just sold better. 

They brought it back with Dark Dawn just because of demand, but the way that didn‚Äôt sell, or receive good reviews, and it kinda killed any chance of another one.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I came up with a scary, defensive combo.  Blur + Mirror Image + Mobile Feat + Booming Blade.  Mirror Image is not a concentration spell, so you can combine it with Blur.  This forces foes to make attacks with disadvantage, and end up hitting an illusion anyway, allowing you to be more confident up close in combat. Then, you can attack an foe and move around the field, negating attacks of opportunity completely, and laying down the hurt with a Booming Blade.  Using the Mobile feat, move out of their range, prompting them to come to you which will do even more Thunder Damage to them.  If they stay still, then have your team member wail on them in your stead.

This is a strong combo that I'd use for a tough battle where you're up against many enemies.  Hell, Arcane Tricksters can utilize this combo as well with their Cunning Action.

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","Disclaimer: I am a high-school student who has no relation to admissions officers or any official universities. All of this is coming from personal experience- my essay is extremely strong (according to my guidance counselor, English teacher and like 4 friends)
A couple of tips that I found helpful: 

If there are any sentences or parts you're unsure about, imagine the essay without them. What does it add? If a sentence or paragraph is there only to fill out words, or if it shows a negative quality (if you're bragging, if you're coming across as pretentious or arrogant), take the sentence out. You don't need to hit 650 words- it's not bad if you are at 650, but you don't have to be there.

Make sure your first and last sentences are the strongest ones. You want the reader to be engaged right from the start- if the first sentence were present in isolation, would you want to learn more about it? Would you want to read an essay that started with that sentence, knowing nothing else about it, or the person who wrote it? Don't start with something generic, vague, or not engaging. Apparently, a really common start is a quotation, but a common start isn't engaging. The end is even more important. The impression the reader gets from the last sentence will be what sticks with them most, so you want it to be incredibly strong. If you read examples of successful essays, every single one of them has a last sentence that sticks. If yours doesn't, rewrite it. 

Read it out loud. See how the sentences flow, see if there are any instances of inconsistent verb tenses or poor grammar. Also see if it sounds like you- when you read it, do you feel like you're talking naturally, or like you're reading a speech someone else wrote? If it's the latter, I would strongly suggest you rework it, so that it feels like you. 

Best of luck! ",1541030602

I‚Äôve put myself in some fucked up mindsets/situations because I hadn‚Äôt practiced harm reduction when using stimulants at that time. It definitely made me want to take a step back and use shit appropriately since then. I‚Äôll admit I fuck up myself at times, but I know what I‚Äôm doing the majority of the time when doing so. 

I don‚Äôt know about ways to prevent the toxicity of meth as much. I mean, I‚Äôve read about a lot of supplements that help. The same supplements people recommend for speed and MDMA. Mostly MDMA, because MDMA, as you know, is a meth analogue and is neurotoxic like meth. I‚Äôve never tried meth, because I feel I‚Äôd love it too much

However, I am confident one of these days I‚Äôll end up eating 20-30mg of some quality shard just to experience it once. I would just do a different ROA, but I‚Äôd rather reduce my liking towards it as much as possible when trying to the shit. I mean, I obviously want to experience the euphoric aspect of it along with the long duration of effects, but I also don‚Äôt want to experience something so grand either. I already have my own psychological dependency on regular amphetamines. I don‚Äôt want one to actual methamphetamine, because binges are a LOT harder to recover from than regular amphetamines 

Supposedly low doses of d-methamphetamine like 5-10mg are considered neuroprotective and beneficial as therapeutic doses of regular amphetamine. I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and say abusing regular amphetamines doesn‚Äôt cause neurotoxicity, because it totally fucking can..but I feel it might be a lot easier to fuck up and a lot harder to recover with meth than regular amps. Many of people I know who‚Äôve done both and/or still do will agree that a meth binge is a lot harder to recover from than an adderall binge, even with proper sleep and nutrition.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I'm running 4 tepidizers (4k watts) off a single regular wire, but you could run any amount of load with this setup. The trick is to alternate between charging one battery and discharging another, while cutting off the charging battery from the load. This works because overloading only happens when the demand from electricity consumers exceeds the power carrying capacity of the wire, regardless of supply, while batteries don't count as consumers. You can charge an unlimited number of batteries off any wire, as long as the batteries are cut off from loads while you do so.

You want the battery connected to automation to turn on somewhere before 0% (10 - 20% is fine for most purposes, but if you are pulling very heavy wattage you may need to go up, 40% at 20 kw), as if it hits 0 you will get temporary power outages.

The main purpose of this is to have a main power distribution network without the heavy decor penalty of heavy watt wire, using two batteries and some automation instead of a transformer to further break it into 1 or 2 kw smaller grids.

You can use it in place of transformers for many purposes as well - for instance, here's a solar power setup using normal wire powering 9 liquid tepidizers, 7 of which are on a heavy wire network from a single battery pair - [https://postimg.cc/gallery/3gzhj7k5u/](https://postimg.cc/gallery/3gzhj7k5u/)

&amp;#x200B;

This setup technically drops power for 1/10th of second each time it switches due to the tiny delay in the not gate, but this doesn't cause any issues with anything I've tested so far. If you find something or that just bothers you, you can use an OR gate with just one lead hooked up for the two shutoffs not attached to the not gate, to add the same delay to them. See one of these - [https://postimg.cc/MX8GqkFj](https://postimg.cc/MX8GqkFj)",1541030603

108thEpi - GW11 - Divided we stand 

After an episode where Bully and the Iceman seemingly managed to disagree on everything, join the Surgeons as they repair the rupture in their relationship with soothing the tones of Justin Dye.

GW11 provides many a conundrum with some big fixtures. Do Liverpool‚Äôs big hitters pose the same threat against an Arsenal side unbeaten in 12? 

Fixture by fixture we break down the gameweek, calling the city defensive conundrum, the value of Aguero consistently playing 60 minutes and if Sterling is still the best sky blue midfield choice.

Is Barkley the cheaper solution to Hazard for Chelsea midfield cover? Do the United French duo have staying power? Is Wilson the darling of FPL?

They've never known cold or hunger or being bounced from home to home. All they've ever known in their animal minds is where they live, who their people are, and their lives are essentially perfect. I told my kids the reason animals lives are shorter is because the pain and confusion an animal feels when they are separated or lose their family is far, far worse than when we lose them. All they've ever known is their people and it's a merciful thing when a pet gets to spend their years on earth in safety and love and even at the end, they're not alone.",1541030604

**THIS STORY IS CURSED**

Jack is black and a very tired man. He often goes to the grocery store to buy some eggs. He drives a blue ford and often waves to his neighbors in the morning.

Jack is sad. He is sad because he knows that today he will die. Not because he wants to but because he has to.

That's the way it works. It worked that way for Emily when Emily was sailing across the sea. She was reading a online paper on a cruise bound for the open Caribbean. She later plummeted to her death.

Before Emily it was Carlisle. He was strong and an impressive athlete but then dropped dead at age 23 from a brain aneurism.

I know these things because I am the one that killed him. I am what killed Emily and Jack too. And I am what will kill you too.

Some people call me a spirit, a ghost from the other side. I am none of those things. But what I am can not be described in words that you would understand.

All that matters is that now, you know that i exist. And you will die.

There is a way, that you can try to break this spell. You'll need to tell others. You'll need to scream at the top of your lungs when you are most afraid.

I am beyond death though, waiting for that fear to consume you. And no matter how far you run or hide I will always be waiting.

4. They have already done this twice- they are gaming the system to have there app live in the playstore for pre registeration.

5. This game maintains the top 1-5 spot in app store pre registration games meaning - they are receiving free store placement and additional installs with a  launch date which they never intended to launch the game on.

6. they post on twitter the game will launch in fall but intentionally did not update any app store details in regards to actual launch date and is intentional.  

7. They can update the app showcase , description or app tag in regards to 'real' launch date but intentionally do not.

"iwatchedanoldmovie","t5_3o2sn","Yeah, The Searchers is in many ways the ultimate western because it really goes deep into deconstructing the Western Hero, as well as the Frontier lifestyle. It's also a trend with many of the other Westerns considered the pinnacle of the genre (Wild Bunch, Unforgiven, )

I have not seen Liberty Valance yet but I have seen a decent amount of Westerns, and it is one of my favourite genres. To me, the theme you talk about in terms of being removed from our own impulses and emotions is what really draws me to the genre, as well as many other movies I adore. Many of my favourite movies feature characters railing against the numbing of society (Year of the Dragon, James Whale's Frankenstein, Rouben Mamoulien's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Blow Out). In my eyes, that is one of the central tragic aspects embodied by the ending of The Searchers, wherein you see that a man who has entered this wilderness and become damaged in large part for the sake of others no longer has a place in the very homestead he protected. 

Personally, I believe our society's very conception of what constitutes a ""hero"" is flawed, and we are no longer sufficiently in touch with our own natures and feelings to appreciate when someone overcomes a true challenge. Instead of, as you say, leaving the various characters of different times and contexts vanish into history, we should strive to understand them that we may better understand ourselves. ",1541030605

But right now people become teachers (knowing very well that it's not an excellent-paying job) and accept the job with the pay as is. I almost became a teacher, but decided the pay probably wasn't worth the effort to me, so I became a pharmacist instead. My sister, however, did end up becoming a teacher because it was worth it to her.

To be honest I would prefer to see teachers get paid more as well, but there's no reason to increase the wages if there are qualified teachers willing to work at the current wage. What really should happen, in my opinion, is to further privatize education, which could improve the quality of education as well as lead to increased wages by rewarding teachers that actually do a good job.",1541030606

"foreignpolicy","t5_2qmlq","&gt; Last Sunday‚Äôs election of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil will likely prove a major break with the country‚Äôs traditional approach to foreign policy. In recent decades, Brazil has sought to influence the international order by relying heavily on ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù‚Äîthe ability to persuade others to align with its diplomatic proposals because of the underlying appeal of Brazil‚Äôs domestic model and its peaceful approach to resolving international disputes.
&gt; 
&gt; Under former President Lula da Silva (2003-2011), Brazil‚Äôs soft power reached its peak. Brazil portrayed itself internationally as a successful, inclusive, multi-ethnic democracy, showcasing years of above-average economic growth, an expanded middle class, and greatly reduced poverty rates. It translated this into greater influence, on occasion, in the global institutions underpinning the liberal international order.
&gt; 
&gt; Since 2014, Brazil‚Äôs soft power has steadily eroded, beginning with a major economic crisis, a massive corruption scandal that led to the jailing of former president Lula and major business figures, and the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the election of Jair Bolsonaro, a long-serving right wing legislator with authoritarian tendencies, will likely put paid to what remains of Brazil‚Äôs soft power abroad. First, the highly polarizing vision of Brazil that President-elect Bolsonaro has set forward is unlikely to appeal to many abroad, nor will it provide new reasons for diplomatic partners to align with Brazil. Second, his attack on Brazil‚Äôs traditional diplomatic policies reflects a lack of support for the present international order, one that for all its flaws, Brazil has relied on to extend its influence and protect its interests. And finally, his desire to align with President Trump‚Äôs foreign policy means betting all of Brazil‚Äôs chips on a fickle U.S. president and a Washington foreign policy establishment that has traditionally cared little for Brazil or its interests.
&gt; 
&gt; **A BREAK WITH THE PAST**
&gt; 
&gt; Bolsonaro won the 2018 Brazilian presidential election by running against the Brazilian Workers‚Äô Party, which many Brazilians blame for the erosion of the middle class and deteriorating public safety. Many Brazilians are desperate for a change, and Bolsonaro capitalized on this by portraying his Workers‚Äô Party opponent, Fernando Haddad, as a man who would take Brazil down the path of Venezuela, a neighboring left-wing dictatorship now known for its spectacular economic implosion and rising tide of economic refugees. Bolsonaro‚Äôs highly polarizing extremist views on women and minorities, his attacks on the media and his opponents as ‚Äúred bandits,‚Äù and his ‚Äúno quarter‚Äù policy justifying extrajudicial killings by police proved to be popular with men and with the growing number of evangelicals in Brazilian society, providing him with a solid second-round election victory on October 28.
&gt; 
&gt; Bolsonaro‚Äôs views are likely to be popular with right-wing populist governments around the world‚Äîrecalling Philippines President Duterte‚Äôs crime policies and President Trump‚Äôs attacks on the media and the opposition‚Äîbut more explicitly colored with racism, sexism, and homophobia. While such policies may appeal to his base at home, if international reactions to Duterte and Trump are any guide, Bolsonaro‚Äôs domestic policies are unlikely to provide a platform for expanding Brazil‚Äôs soft power more broadly.
&gt; 
&gt; Nor does Bolsonaro appear to think much of traditional Brazilian approaches to diplomacy. Bolsonaro has vowed to revise Mercosur, Brazil‚Äôs longstanding regional integration project. Desiring to increase agribusiness opportunities in the Amazon, he has threatened to pull out the Paris climate change agreement (later recanted, at least temporarily). He has vowed to move the Brazilian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, much as President Trump did, overturning Brazil‚Äôs longstanding support for a two-state solution. Bolsonaro has been highly critical of China, which is Brazil‚Äôs largest trading partner, to the alarm of Brazilian business leaders and the Chinese government.
&gt; 
&gt; President-elect Bolsonaro and his team have frequently expressed their admiration for President Trump, and they have vowed to align Brazil‚Äôs diplomacy closely with that of the United States. The front-runner to serve as Bolsonaro‚Äôs foreign minister, Brazilian diplomat Ernesto Fraga Ara√∫jo, has written a sympathetic journal article about Trump, portraying the U.S. president‚Äôs foreign policy as an effort to combat globalists and save the Christian West from radical Islam and global cultural Marxism. His views apparently align closely with those of Bolsonaro‚Äôs foreign policy team.
&gt; 
&gt; Observers have argued that the closest historical analogy to Bolsonaro‚Äôs approach to the Trump administration is Argentina‚Äôs policy of ‚Äúcarnal relations‚Äù with the United States under President Carlos Menem in the 1990s, although the values that underpinned the U.S.-Argentina relationship‚Äîa shared interest in democracy, human rights, peacekeeping, and multilateralism‚Äîwere quite different. It also recalls the pro-U.S. foreign policy of Brazil‚Äôs first military president after the 1964 coup d‚Äô√©tat, General Castelo Branco. President Trump and Bolsonaro have already expressed their mutual admiration, and Bolsonaro‚Äôs foreign policy team may attempt to pursue a strategy of flattering President Trump to secure his support internationally, as other foreign leaders have done. This may have its earliest impact on Brazilian foreign policy in the case of Venezuela, with the United States and Bolsonaro backing stronger action than Brazil had previously been willing to pursue.
&gt; 
&gt; However pro-U.S. Bolsonaro becomes, Brazil would do well to recall the fate of Argentina in 2001, where after years of pro-U.S. ‚Äúautomatic alignment‚Äù in foreign policy, Argentina was nevertheless left to its fate by the George W. Bush administration, largely for ideological reasons, when the 2001 financial crisis struck. Brazil may be the fifth-largest country in the world, but South America never ranks very high on the agenda in Washington, and President Trump may simply accept Brazil‚Äôs support without Bolsonaro having much to show for it in the end. Brazil‚Äôs military government (1964-1985) and Brazil‚Äôs post-World War II leaders would tell much the same story of how U.S. support fell short when Brazil looked to the United States for development and security assistance at critical junctures.
&gt; 
&gt; **DIM PROSPECTS FOR BRAZIL‚ÄôS ‚ÄúSOFT POWER‚Äù**
&gt; 
&gt; The 2018 Brazilian presidential elections were not about foreign policy. They were about rejecting the establishment and the Workers‚Äô party. A majority of voters backed Jair Bolsonaro to send a message that Brazil could no longer pursue business as usual.
&gt; 
&gt; Although mostly focused at home, President-elect Bolsonaro also looks poised to shake up Brazil‚Äôs foreign policy‚Äîbut it is not clear if the elements of his agenda add up to a strategy that will advance Brazil‚Äôs national interests abroad. If Brazil‚Äôs soft power is increasingly diminished, how would a President Bolsonaro hope to compensate? Perhaps an alternative form of ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù that attracts populist right-wing leaders, particularly President Trump, will be enough to advance Bolsonaro‚Äôs agenda. But riding the coattails of an easily distracted United States and relying on a mercurial Trump administration does not seem to offer a reliable guarantee for Brazilian national interests.
&gt; 
&gt; There are alternatives that fall close to Bolsonaro‚Äôs policy preferences and would do more to advance Brazil‚Äôs national interests. A Brazil that became moderately closer to the United States, set greater boundaries on China‚Äôs influence, tuned up a long-stalled Mercosur, worked to bring the Lima Group and the United States together on a shared (and firmer) Venezuela policy, and doubled down on diplomacy and the international order could do much good for Brazil‚Äôs influence abroad. This approach would be even more successful if Brazil‚Äôs institutions at home do well in containing Bolsonaro‚Äôs wilder flights of rhetoric and policy, showcasing the soft power inherent in Brazilian democracy. But to bet on that now would seem to be a mistake.",1541030608

Day laborers, and day to day contracts, are extremely rare anymore. Even McDonalds has several pages of employment contract to sign, and that's in at will states.  

A good example would be a severance package. A company can't remove that from the contract without the employee agreeing, to then fire them and not pay the severance.

The imbalance in power and knowledge between most employers and employees is significant, but that is a separate issue.  As generally, when an employer decides to amend all its employment contracts, most employees sign rarely reading it.",1541030609

If a piece is written in B major, that's a key. B major is also a scale. The two are related, but are not the same thing. The key of B major is not restricted to only using notes from the B major scale. The B major scale on the other hand only has the notes B C# D# E F# G# A#. Any notes other than these are not in the B major scale.

There is no limit to how many scales can be used in a piece of music.",1541030611

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt; Is the game repetitive, cookie-cutter open world nonsense?

So far it hasn't been repetitive.

&gt; Is it too boring?

I have been bored at some points but that's because the game is slow. It's intentionally slow. e.g. hunting you actually need to take a little bit of time doing. The pacing is dependent on whether you stick doing the main storyline or if you like powerleveling before advancing. Don't powerlevel it isn't worth it.

&gt; Is it just an interactive movie?

Standard rockstar game so far. Cutscene, action scene, cut scene, free roam, cut scene etc.

&gt; Are the controls and graphics OK?

Graphics are great for a console game. Controls are decent, though the horse can be a pain sometimes especially because bumping someone will get you a bounty and can be annoying when you aren't paying attention (I play normally with another monitor with TV shows playing).

&gt; How is the gunplay?

Too easy so far. Similar to GTA5, the autolock is overpowered, but thats sort of the trade off for having to use a controller.

Biggest criticism I've got is the bounty system, you can kill a guy, loot his corpse, ride halfway across the map and suddenly there is a witness, and then you have to deal with bounty hunters that come after you and when you kill them your bounty just keeps ballooning out. Trying to use your bandana or a sneak, hide bodies, etc. doesn't seem to work very well, or at least I haven't been able to make it work very well yet. Also if you are killed you lose money and your bounty still stays, death doesn't clear it. What's more annoying is you have these big action set pieces where you commit all these crimes, no bounty, the mission ends you go and loot a body and then suddenly there is a witness running to the police.... I just massacred 50 people but getting $2 of a corpse is what I get pinged for, so there ends up being a lot of dead witnesses.",1541030611

By all metrics 1989 was much more successful creating pop music earlier. Songs like Shake It Off and Blank Space were embraced widely by the public, and Taylor Swift was actually liked for once. What makes Emotion more influential in contributing to poptimism than that?

I do recognize that Taylor Swift is controversial and actually agree with the general sentiment that Emotion was key. But I cannot answer myself why Emotion was more important than 1989 was for poptimism.

"CompetitionShooting","t5_2tbs6","Disclaimer: I don't shoot Open, and have zero interest in it.

.38 super comp is better in every single way except cost and availability. You get more consistent ejection, more forgiving when reloading, wider powder selection, you can use old-style C-mores instead of micro-dots, everything. But shooting high volumes means spending a lot of time scrounging for brass or paying through the nose for it. 9mm can work but it's a lot more testing and tweaking. From what I hear.

As for actually doing the reloading, it's exactly the same as loading 9mm, just less room to mess up. 

Be prepared to pay with either money or time. If you get one of the sub-3k options, expect to spend a lot of time debugging it when it shits on you in matches. If you're not that worried about being competitive and just want a new toy to wrench on and tinker with, have at it.

But in general I'd say stick with what you have and just practice. What does switching to Open gain you except novelty?

"tattoo","t5_2qiud","I mean you also could go with a full color realistic flower with no outlines if you plan to have it touched up regularly anyways. Imo it also depends a lot on the skill level of the artists.
I see many color tattoos without outlines that simply lack the contrast and saturation to keep the design nice for a long time. 
I have some kinda realistic full color flowers as part of my sleeve and I witnessed how quickly especially the lighter colors faded. Yet the artist used a lot of darker/stronger colors as a substitute for black outlines and worked a lot with contrasts and highlights to hold the design together. I still might need a touch up in a few years though.
But especially when you're new to tattoos you need to be aware of how quickly some colors will fade. The tattoo you posted will probably lose most of the blue color just by healing. A good artist is aware of that and will use colors accordingly. ",1541030615

You have to stop hating them, it isn't optional.

**Matthew 6**

&gt;**14**¬†‚ÄúFor if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. **15¬†But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.**

Do something nice for them. Give them a gift card, offer to take them to dinner. If they refuse, know that you tried to reconcile and God will repay them according to their works. Being kind will heap coals of fire on their head in the judgement if they do not repent before God and reconcile themselves.

**Romans 12**

&gt;**17**¬†Repay no one evil for evil. Have\[[e](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-28263e)\] regard for good things in the sight of all men. **18**¬†If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. **19**¬†Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but *rather* give place to wrath; for it is written, ‚ÄúVengeance *is* Mine, I will repay,‚Äù says the Lord. **20**¬†Therefore  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Äú**If your enemy is hungry, feed him;If he is thirsty, give him a drink;For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.‚Äù**  
&gt;  
&gt;**21**¬†Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

As I type this while letting my PU swarm do its job, everyone has peaced out except Brandenburg and Muscovy. Got a free Alsace in the peace deal too.

God knows what math the AI did when it decided to attack Austria. What finally let it trigger it was quite simple:

a.) Ottomans got attacked by Mamluks and are fighting a two front war. Oh, by the way, Byzantium is my PU, so this is a VERY weak Ottoblob

b.) Since the Brandenburg dude was a babbling buffoon, he disclosed his plans early. i joined the Catholics just a few days before the league war fired.

This can be effective against the large and infrequent volleys of reduced sized launchers.

And if the volleys are all coming in at once, the amount of distance you will lose on the enemy for stopping in space isn't going to be that much compared to the range of the missiles.

If your fleet is 10,000 km/s minimum speed vs 30,000 km/s missiles, fired every 60 seconds at, say, 60 million km.  That is 2,000 seconds travel time.  10 volleys would be 600 seconds, you could only go 6 million km during the time from detection of the first missile to the impact of the last.

The primary reason I've seen for Republicans to be against immigration in general, though especially illegal immigration and now birthright citizenship, is that the people who immigrate aren't voting Republican. I would argue that this is the fault of Republicans, who are apparently incapable of convincing these people that their policies will positively impact America as a whole, and thus their lives in America.

Also, I'm pretty certain that ""the STATES OWN property right"" is not a common libertarian idea. I can't imagine that most libertarians would have a problem with any amount of immigration provided they're not paying for it. This is entirely separate from anarcho-capitalism, which quite literally believes that there should be no government entities, while it's entirely possible to believe that a government doesn't have the right to decide who is a citizen while still believing in a government-run justice system and defensive military.

It is against the core principles of libertarian philosophy to enshrine a right to control what goes on beyond your private property; you can't use the government to prevent other people from buying or renting property near yours so long as they don't violate the NAP. ",1541030618

&gt;What sort of things would you find acceptable as justification outside of the window?

Let me first make the point that I think having to provide a justification to seek an abortion implicates both the right to bodily autonomy and the right to privacy, and I concluded that there must be a time where no justification is required.

I don't have any specific list of justifications in mind. My point is that after that initial window it is appropriate to require justification. Asking whether the justification is sufficient will depend on the proposed justification and situation.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, it seems like there should be no prohibition against terminating a non-viable baby at any stage in the pregnancy; however, outside the initial window, if the abortion is sought the elements of this justification must be convincing made.

&amp;#x200B;

Another justification could be that the pregnancy wasn't identified in time or that it was otherwise impossible to act within the initial window. This would have to be put forward as a justification, and we would have to develop an appropriate policy for such a case.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that I have not spoken about rape and incest. This is mostly because it isn't necessary to talk about it. Because there is the ""no justification needed"" window, there is no need to make these specifically an exception. I can see how an incestuous situation could easily mean that the pregnant person is prevented from exercising their ability to choose within the initial window, but this isn't an exception it is just another justification that can be put forward.",1541030622
"chefknives","t5_33l1t","Ok, so you're telling me only very few people touch up their knives regularly?

This comes back to one of my original question [1] that no one wants to stay on-topic with. People ignore any pleas for testing methods or specifics but go on about how *I* just don't know.

I'm still not sure what people assume is the situation here. Am sitting here with dull $3 knives without a clue on sharpness or cutting?

In that case I can't imagine how insanely sharp and durable everyone else's tools must be.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Except they can do both quite easily. You can have ships that are specialised to a certain role, and can have ships dedicated to a certain role (Like the Prospector and the Orion are dedicated to the mining role).

The Valk would be an example of a specialised ship rather than a dedicated ship. It is designed with being a dropship in mind, and as such excels at that role.

But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be capable of running cargo about. For one it would allow it to sit above the Hoplite and beneath the Hercules on the ""Troop Support"" tree. Hercules can resupply entire ground efforts, but what if you need to drop some supplies to a small camp further into enemy territory? You could send a Hercules but you'd need a big escort to do so and you might not have that at your disposal. Or you could load it up in your Valk and drop it in that way.

Making ships flexible doesn't make specialised or dedicated ships obsolete. That's not how balance works.",1541030625

"DnDBehindTheScreen","t5_36c1q","When I first started playing DnD, I thought about finding or creating something like this for my paladin's oath. Partly because I was still wrestling with my parents' prohibition against playing.  I'm an adult now and can make my own decisions, but I wrestled with whether I could play without compromising my own faith convictions. 

In the end, I decided I would play in a way that doesn't contradict my real world faith. Since DnD is a collaborative story, my part of the story reflects who I am, and who I am is a lifelong Christian. (As host and DM I also have a significant influence over the whole game.  I don't pound other players with my faith, but I did warn them all that the World is good and orderly. They can play chaotic or evil, as long as they remember actions have consequences.)

I think you've done a better job of faithfully portraying the God of the Bible than any I've seen.  Still, I'm reluctant to use it. My take on it is simple.  In my imaginary world, there are a lot of imaginary deities. In my real faith, there is one God.  I don't imagine these fictitious angels, demons, or deities represent real creatures, any more than the dragons or goblins do.  But I also don't try to reduce the real King of kings to a stat block and page of lore. That's my only concern, because that is how I reconcile faith and hobby.

(And they secretly actually liked the item). The way cases are handled right now, if you open a case, you have to be ready to send the item back. 

If there was an option to click a button and say ‚Äúyes, I got my item, but it‚Äôs not exactly as described so I want half of my money back‚Äù buyers would be pushing it like crazy!

I‚Äôve had buyers purchase boots and then say that they are 2 sizes too big, ‚Äúbut they would be happy to keep if they got half of what they spent back‚Äù.  Why would anyone want a pair of rain boots two sizes too big? This person was hoping poshmark would side with them AND let them keep the boots. I would rather get my item back to re-sell to a new buyer than only get half of my money. 

It would be hard for poshmark to quantify what qualifies for a return vs a partial refund vs having a case denied. Just my opinion, but I would be scared, as a seller if this was an option.

Sg.

Pl.
Nom.: kings
Gen.: kings'/kings's (kingses) 

I'm pretty sure those are the only two distinct cases in English, barring irregular nouns and also pronouns, which tend to have more. The morphemes -'s and -' are actually obligatory contractions from the original possessive ending (you may wish to check me on this as I could be wrong) -es. I'm not sure why the obligatory contraction exists, but I'm fairly sure it comes from Norman French as that's the language from which English gets its apostrophes.

If I had to decline a pronoun, I'd do it thus

Sg.
Nom.: he
Gen.: his
Dat./acc.: him

* customized character would crash the game two times in a row when trying to accept, so I went with default one
* some areas with lots of stuff and not just foliage eat VRAM like crazy (ultra preset by default). Lookout tower on that railway ""station"" where power armor spawns is a good example. It halted R9 Fury to like 3 FPS, GTX 1060 to 35-45 FPS and Vega 64 with 8GB of VRAM managed to survive this
* voice comm on start of the game utterly annoying and confusing, later on it's even more annoying. Mute option really needed
* hard hitting slow weapons, melee superior to fast shooting poo-pistols for close quarter combat - kind of playing into F4 cookie-cutter plus way higher importance of melee. And the melee is to static. You can use VATS but still why a protectron instantly rotates around his axis?
* No really digged deep into data but aside of stimpacks there is little for efficient health regen it seems. Maybe some bandages and first aid system known from WoW? Something that somewhat works, is easy to craft and can help when stimpacks are out. Food seems low on efficiency.

E.g. I like to shoot more at enemies than other Anas do but make up for my healing by hitting the right allies at the right time. So my second support would usually need to top off any trash damage when I am busy doing other stuff and they would easily get gold healing.  
You could say my healing darts have more value on average than those of a healbot Ana since I would more often go for high priority and less for low priority heals than they would.  


However, if I have silver healing and my darts intended for the enemy don't bring me value or if I don't hit my high priority heals or heal the wrong target instead then that would mean I am not performing.

I try to look at things around me and notice them and try to focus on them instead of the pain. That is the bad kind. Smaller panic attacks can make me so angry I lash out in anger or I start talking really fast, or I get completely quiet and feel completely empty of anything but emotional anguish. It is hard to describe beyond feeling completely out of control and like the panic will never stop.

The good thing is if I know that something is likely to trigger me in advance, I can kind of plan for it and calm down. Like, if I see a movie with child death (as one reason for my PTSD is losing my oldest daughter to trisomy 18 at six days old).  But sometimes a song, or a smell, or just the way something looks will take me into that NICU, holding my daughter and singing to her as she dies in my arms. When that happens, all I can do is let myself get upset, have a good, ugly cry, and try to keep breathing.

"radon","t5_2xhey","Radon systems are not really about moving a ton of air out.  The main purpose of a radon system is to create a negative pressure under the house, which counters your homes natural tendency to draw air up through itself. So what radon fan you need depends on what the soil conditions are like under your house. If you have a nice bed of crushed stone and drain tile, you would do good with an average fan size like the Radon Away RP145.  Packed dirt or sand you will need a fan built more for higher pressure Like the RP265. Wet dirt or clay you will need a high pressure fan like a GP501.  However it is always better to consult with a licensed professional, and it may be better to go with them as most of these fans come with a five year warranty, only if it was installed by a professional.  Also most migrators offer guaranteed results and  10 year to life time warranties on their systems (at least in my area) which could save you in the long run.",1541030635

"FortNiteBR","t5_3oeyf","&gt; And there is almost no similaritiy between these TWO. 

Alright, question for you, what mechanic *is* similar to fall damage, by your definition? Because mechanics to my mind don't even need to be similar to be compared.  The act of comparison is not dependent on similarity, and in fact is often enhanced by a lack of similarity (look up the word juxtaposition).  

&gt; Fall damage aspect is important wheter it exists or not in F/TPS games.

Not really sure what you're trying to say here.  

&gt; In fortnite, you could punish those who overbuild and killing them in process, but aside from that you barely take fall damage (even falling off of most of roof in salty spring do not deal you any damage, so its not annoyance most of time), making fall damage not annoyance, but a satisfying mechanic to utilize in combat. (at least that's my opinion)

See, I disagree.  Fall damage is already mitigated by building anyway.  So removing the last little bit of it isn't a bit deal to me.  Pretty much the only scenario where it matters is if a player outbuilds you (read: outskills you) and you go to the bottom to knock them down because you aren't good enough to keep up with them.  Personally, I am completely fine with that scenario no longer being possible, because it reemphasizes building skill.  ",1541030635

Additional context to consider surrounding living conditions of those on the street in Cornwall;

Cornwall is the poorest area in the UK, it is the second poorest area in the entire of Northern Europe. 30% of children living in Cornwall are doing so in poverty. Some parts of Cornwall that number rises to just over 50% of children living in poverty. Food bank usage is through the roof, one Food Bank in particular gives out over 10,000 meals per month, of which roughly 30% of the families are working poor. That's just one food bank, to families where both partners are working full time yet still can't afford to feed their children.

Fucking disgusting that the council would let this happen, don't even care about the gender issue or whether it would happen in reverse. It's just fucking wrong.

&gt; Steppenwolf is a rock band which formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1967. The band originally consisted of John Kay (vocals, guitar), Michael Monarch (guitar), Rushton Moreve (bass), Goldie McJohn (keyboards) and Jerry Edmonton (drums). The band is best known for their hit singles ""Born to be Wild"" and ""Magic Carpet Ride"". They were named after the novel Der Steppenwolf by German author Hermann Hesse.

&gt; Frontman John Kay's mother escaped with him at age 4 from Soviet occupied East Germany, an event recounted in the song ""Renegade"" on the album Steppenwolf Seven. His family resettled in Hannover, West Germany, before moving to Canada in 1958. Kay is partially blind, hence the use of dark glasses

&gt; In 1968, Nick St. Nicholas replaced Moreve as bass player.

&gt; Steppenwolf had its origins in the Toronto blues band Sparrow, which was formed in 1964 and played coffeehouses in Yorkville. By 1967 they had settled in San Francisco.

&gt; Steppenwolf rocketed to fame after their third single, ""Born to Be Wild"" was used in the movie Easy Rider, as well as ""The Pusher"". The former song may have coined the term ""heavy metal"". This was followed by several more hits, including ""Magic Carpet Ride"" from Steppenwolf the Second, and ""Rock Me"" from At Your Birthday Party. Many fans consider their double album Steppenwolf Live [an extended single album in the UK] the best of Steppenwolf's releases. Monster and For Ladies Only were the band's most political albums, and are still fondly remembered by fans as two of the best rock &amp; roll snapshots of the attitudes of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

&gt; The band broke up in 1971, and Kay pursued a solo career. Steppenwolf reformed in 1974 with the album Slow Flux, and disbanded in 1976. Afterwards, several versions of the band toured North America until Kay reformed the official version of the group in 1980. 

&gt; John Kay released a solo album in 2001.

The university system is also as good as your degree. Coming in as a published academic from a US university is worth more points obviously. In that case, why would you want to come to Korea except to be a visiting professor, though, you see what I'm saying.

""Oh, I could show you the evidence but you'd just deny it"" is what people who believe in irrational and unsubstantiated nonsense often say when they realized they've reached the point in the conversation where they they'd have to admit they *don't* actually have the evidence that they claimed to have *if* they were willing to be honest.

So, a little context; I have severe BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and one of the symptoms that comes with that is a lack of emotional and relationship permanence. 

Because of this, I constantly ask my girlfriend (bless her soul for putting up with my shit tbh) if she still likes and is attracted to me. She doesn't say it outright and it very well could be my anxiety and paranoia fucking with me, but I feel like she's exhausted by this, and I keep wondering if I should just suck it up and if I'm being an asshole for putting that on her and potentially stressing her out. The last thing I want to do is stress her out or upset her and I do my best to communicate, but I know she wouldn't have the heart to tell me if I'm being an asshole or not.

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously i worked intake and records for a law office. we had 10 personal injury lawyers on that side, and literally half my day was filled with literally almost verbatim, people with that same story. and all of those hundreds, not one turned out to have any merit. Malpractice cases are easy as hell, especially orthopedic ones because the results are easy to see. But this person says  they 1. had a surgery they didnt need to.  2. no lawyer will touch them and 3. no doctor can fixit it or find the problem. and 4. they have been referred to mental health people. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are all huge tell tale signs on their own. together its like the mother lode of bullshit.  They say other doctors have told them the surgery was messed up and  that it shouldnt have been done.  Ill be honest if thats true then any lawyer would DROOL over that case, its easy money for them, they get 33.3% of the total settlement, before any taxes mind you. Thats easy money, 1 or more doctors testify that another doc  screwed up, thats a guaranteed insurance company payout. Most surgeons carry 10 mil minimum in malpractice and hospitals even more. Those companies will do ANYTHING to not go to court and a possible maximum payout in front of a jury.  And juries never stay on the side of the insurance companies and the doctors. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when you put it all together and the person tell you stuf you know ids absolutely not true, like you have to be dead to win a malpractice case, you know if they are lying that much, they are obviously lying about everything else as well. ",1541030642

He is under cover, in a war zone, and doesn't wait for the officer to return his salute before leaving.

Then came the KC game. What a freaking embarrassment. The announcers actually felt sorry for us. What a joke. I'm pissed off now just thinking about it, so thanks for that. I didn't even want to drink that night I felt so sick. I mean, I still did. But I didn't WANT to.

So yeah. They have to show me. I don't owe this team any more of my fragile psyche until they win another big game. Unless they prove me wrong, I'm going to assume that we finish within 1 or 2 games of .500 and lose in the first round of the playoffs again, should we qualify. ",1541030643

&gt; It is a fact that all life fits into a taxonomic hierarchy. It is also a fact that all lifeforms share various levels of DNA similarity. It is a third fact that the hierarchies of both methodologies are identical.

This agreement doesn't mean much, though, because the modern taxonomic hierarchies have been circumscribed by molecular similarity. Even then, there's not widespread agreement between methods that use different sets of genes to infer relationships between the major domains or even major clades within those domains.

Somatic *in vivo* genome editing is still in infancy, as of this year I know of less than 10 studies that have used AAV vectors, many of which didn't reach 1% targeting efficiency, not even counting ""in vivo selection"" (cells get replaced after some time...).

I'm very skeptical about the possibility of using AAV for injections, at least for the whole body. In some organs (liver, kidney, blood vessels), maybe. It's certainly concievable on paper, but in practise less so.",1541030645

&gt;he said a small prayer to each of the five gods, and then a final, sixth prayer to the Dungeon Master that Juniper believed was the one true god of Aerb. Prayers to the gods had their own specific structures to them, with motifs and iconographies that the pious were expected to adhere to, even if prayer itself was next to useless. The prayer to the Dungeon Master took some thought, because no standards existed for praying to what was only a theoretical deity.

&gt;Dungeon Master, if I must be on your railroad, let me ride the train with good humor. If I must roll the dice, let it be known that I would not object to you fudging. Place a dungeon before me, and I will delve it. Place a dragon before me, and I will slay it. **I am, above all else, your player.**

Saying Neji doesn‚Äôt have any feats or any plot significance is a HUGE stretch. I don‚Äôt even know how you can presumably write this with a straight face. Neji beat Kidomaru, one of the Sound 4.

"FFBraveExvius","t5_34n2x","&gt; It's obviously beneficial for F2P players, but I'm not sure it's overly beneficial to people that spend.

It depends on how much you spend. For those who don't spend, or don't spend enough to even get to the EX Unit (which using JP's point system, would mean a minimum of $500 spent and $600 per additional copy if ported to GL), obviously the GL system is better since those players wouldn't even have a chance to get those units with the JP system.

For spenders who spend enough to lap through occasionally, the JP system is probably preferable as the EX units are generally going to be better than a random rainbow. It's still a bit of a tossup as you have eliminated the chance to get those units outside of the EX system, so it is very possible to have fewer copies under the JP system if you have only lapped enough times to obtain a few EX units.

At very high levels of spending though, getting more of the same EX units over and over again isn't necessarily better than a random rainbow anymore, and there are players out there who spend enough to get another EX unit every week, if not sooner.",1541030651

A ""25-pair"" is a standard telecommunications cable containing 25 twisted pairs of copper telephone wires.

Standard cable sizes are:

"WahoosTipi","t5_2sd82","They're actually  testing out a variety of ideas, and randomly picking out 4 each time you take the survey. Here's everything I was able to get from repeated refreshing of the survey:

**Insider Value Program**: Fans can enroll in a program to receive offers and discounts via the Ballpark app. These benefits allow you to save money and enjoy even more Tribe games and gear. These offers and discounts could be include tickets, concessions, and merchandise purchases and would not be able to be transferred or resold.

**Suite-like Seats**: A portion of seats in the lower seating bowl will be sectioned off to create a ""suite-like"" experience, but closer to the action. Fans get increased privacy and comfort but at lower price point than a traditional suite. These suite-like seats could be outfitted with features such as frosted glass walls, padded seats and food and beverage delivery.

**Split-the-Bill Service**: Fans coordinating a group outing to Progressive Field can ""reserve"" their purchase (for a limited time) by paying their own portion of the group's bill and providing the email addresses of the other members of their party. Fans no longer need to pay the entire up-front cost themselves and worry about getting paid back. The service will email the remaining group members their portion of the bill and complete the purchase once everyone has paid.

**Design-Your-Own Seats**: Fans can now choose to select from a range of physical upgrades to their ballpark seat. That way, fans can enjoy a more personalized, comfortable game day seating experience. These upgrades could include features like padded cushions, power outlets, and cup-holders / food trays.

**Cabanas**: Fans can enjoy the game in a ‚Äòcabana‚Äô style seating area in place of the terrace boxes in the upper right field area. These ‚Äòcabanas‚Äô provide an exciting social atmosphere but in a more intimate setting. These cabanas could be outfitted with features such as comfy patio style seating, cabana roofing for weather protection, and pre-stocked food and beverages.

**Mobile Ordering**: Fans can order food and beverages from their seat and have it delivered to them during the game. That way fans can skip the lines and never miss a pitch. This could include features like saving your favorites for easy re-ordering and convenient payment via direct integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay.

**Seat Upgrades**: Fans who already have tickets to a game will have the opportunity to upgrade the location of their seats shortly before game time. You get a better seat, closer to the action, conveniently making your Progressive Field experience even better. You don't have to purchase a completely new ticket to upgrade your seats, you simply pay the price difference between the ticket you have and the ticket you want.",1541030652

It is incredibly difficult to set up a scenario to catch someone who is hiding something, especially if they have an inkling you may be onto them. You should consider waiting until the ball is in your court again like it was after the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fuck‚Äù text. Then, make your play. It needs to be crafty, careful, and deliberate in order to set up a scenario that can only have one of these outcomes:

1. You and your GF are 100% positive that this guy is trying to get with your GF

2. You and your GF‚Äôs sister are 100% positive that this guy is trying to get with your GF, or has already gotten with her

3. You are 100% certain this guy is not trying to get with your GF and is just not great with proper social boundaries.


Any other outcome I can think of either leaves you still unsure about the situation, or in a scenario where you know what is going on for sure, but either:

A: You look like an asshole to your GF and her sister for trying to set this guy up when he hasn‚Äôt done anything

B: You know he‚Äôs trying to get with your GF, but nobody else does, so it‚Äôs your word against his.


Sorry you got sucked into some BS drama. There are enough toxic people out there that I think it happens to everyone at some point. Whatever happens, you seem to be a pretty good writer and have a story that would for sure captivate a select audience. Maybe the baseline story for a movie script one day if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing. Good luck!

PF: Millsap/Saric/John Collins (out)

C: KAT/Kanter/Gasol

I have Josh Richardson, Danny Green and Markieff Morris on waiver is any one of them worth using my claim.

Brook lopez, Ish Smith, Bryn forbes, Siakam, Nerlens Noel, Zach Collins, Alex Len and Ilyasova are free agents.

Saric has been a disappointment so far and I think it's due to Fultz being integrated in the team, Fournier is not that regular and performed poorly lately

It got us Federal agencies like the DEA which overstep the constitution by doing shit like seizing property including money in a bank account under the justification that its drug money. Even worse they don't have to prove your dealing drugs you instead have to hire a lawyer (more money) to prove that property was not purchased with drug money and better hurry you only have a window to get that property back or else it is forfeited to the DEA. In the end even if you do the property back your still out legal fees because good luck suing the federal government.

Legalize it and tax it like marijuana (which in most states a large part of the price is just the tax) and yet still undercut illegal dealers as well as providing a pure and guaranteed product.

Drug users still get drugs as no matter how illegal it is because criminals wait for it     break the law!",1541030654

But in Skyrim, they had multiple voice actors record the **exact same lines**. Like, the main cost here is the voice acting and the audio storage/memory size, not the writing, so just write different lines. ""I took an arrow to the knee"" isn't nearly good enough to warrant 5 different voices saying it. There's no reason for those takes to not be 5 different lines altogether.

Either way you still have the same storage/memory cost and actor cost, except now you hurt the game's immersion even more for no reason by having the same line be repeated not just by different characters, but even by different voices.",1541030654

So selling your soul to the Devil means that you place your immortal self (your truest You-ness) into the Devil's hands rather than God's. This is not a significant difficulty while you're alive and inhabiting your body but when your body dies your soul is freed  you now belong to the Devil.

What this specifically means varies really wildly depending on what your particular branch of the faith believes. The very concept of Hell is one that has significant disputes, as is the Devil. It even relates to the problem of Evil - what it means to have an all-powerful, all-knowing, purely good God who created a universe in which there is evil.

"AskTruFemcels","t5_p73kq","&gt;It's stupid to be female and against feminism. 

Your idea of feminism is a relic. Plenty of women in this thread have claimed egalitarianism which strives for equality just as much as old feminism did.

&gt; Did you think we were a million of the exact same person?

The way a lot of feminists spout the same talking points it'd be easy to think so. The label is toxic and no one is going to distinguish between the feminism you believe in and the one feminist Stacy practices. In fact because she's prettier than you she will get more coverage and will therefore always eclipse you, as unfair as that is. So why not choose a movement with a less toxic connotation?

&gt;as evidenced in your reply to me, you think I'm supposed to reject feminism based on that person's behavior.

What would I get out of that? To discredit femcels? Discredit the feminists?

If I was really the enemy your trying to paint me as couldn't I do just as much damage going the other way by getting femcels to admit they are feminists thereby verifying a long held belief people have had about feminists being bitter and unattractive, with the added bonus of associating femcel loneliness to their political beliefs giving their enemies one more avenue of attack?

"tall","t5_2qv8g","I'm not specifically into tall/taller women, but I also don't see them as any *less* dateable do to their height; to me, there are good things about women of all heights. 

What I like about taller women: 

1) It is really nice being held in the embrace of a taller woman, all enveloped in her arms, pressed into her frame, it's such a comforting sensation! Often, in my experience, taller women struggle to embrace being the larger partner (and I'm sure many short men struggle in the same way), but if you can embrace it, it's really nice to be the little spoon to a taller woman. 

2) Tall woman/short man couples are breaking a gender norm by dating one another. We associate largeness with men and smallness with women, and we further associate a host of characteristics related to those size dynamics with gender as well. By dating one another, we're thumbing our noses at patriarchal representations of gender. That's cool!

3) Being height-gender outliers gives us a lot of common ground for bonding on not fitting in with society's expectations of what we should look like. It can be really nice to be with someone understands what it feels like to go through that. 

So yeah, those are the things I like about tall women. To be honest, I don't think all that many short guys would automatically write off a woman they liked who was taller than they are. Often, we assume you don't like us because we're too short--unfortunately, this is another way tall women and short men live a shared experience. 

Anyway, I hope you can overcome those feelings of insecurity, because, at least to me, tall women are just as dateable as shorter ones. ",1541030663

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","This number is very difficult to trust because it is based on the self-identified owner occupied status; taken from the original mortgage application.  Answering no to this question will prompt the bank to underwrite the loan as an investment property.  And most banks require investors to make a 30% down payment, and pay less favorable loan terms.  Many investors lie on their mortgage application in order to secure better financing.  This is one of the most common forms of mortgage fraud, and distorts the true home ownership rate.  

The last time the home ownership rate peaked was during the height housing bubble.  After the crash, the Federal Reserve published a staff paper that showed investor owned properties peaked at the same time Fannie Mae was claiming home ownership peaked.  The Federal Reserve staff used credit bureau data to show how many buyers owned multiple properties.  And they were also able to show which home buyers commuted fraud since the buyers did not actually change their mailing address to the new home.  ",1541030663

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yeah, all I was saying was that if your friend makes $30k in California, it's probably closer to like [$25,000 after taxes](https://neuvoo.com/tax-calculator/?iam=&amp;salary=30000&amp;from=year&amp;region=California).  Meanwhile, if this person is making $40k a year in Texas, that's probably closer to like [$34,000 after taxes](https://neuvoo.com/tax-calculator/?iam=&amp;salary=40000&amp;from=year&amp;region=Florida) (EDIT: it's actually Florida, but that really doesn't change anything as they don't have income taxes either). So this person is still making nearly $10k a year more in post tax dollars. 

I didn't even get into cost of living disparities, because that would involve too much info I don't have. Either way, it's not a lot of money.  

By using the quick ""income must equal 40 times monthly rent"" rule, your friend can only spend $750/month on rent, leaving them with about $16,000 left over to cover all other expenses (or about $1,333/month). This guy fares slightly better, being able to spend $1000/month on rent, leaving him with around $22,000 to cover all other expenses (or about $1,833/month). 

For both of these individuals, you're talking about slim margins and neither will be able to save a good amount of money unless they are living very frugally. So I can understand the struggle each of them face. That's a fair amount of pressure and I would urge OP to perhaps look into other locations first instead of completely changing careers now. My sister in law makes $110,000 teaching third grade in MA, so I know these salaries can fluctuate due to location.",1541030663

"canada","t5_2qh68","My concern is when to get a house. We want one in the next year and we're both close to permanent non contract unionized jobs. 

And combined we'll have a reasonable income, though MOST of my money will be going into paying my student debts as soon as I can. Hope to kill them within 5 years by paying fairly aggressively. 

But is it worth getting a house in the next year? when will the mythical bubble come. 

Thats what I am worried about. If we get a house and it loses mad value in the first few years that would really suck. But the home isn't an investment for us as much as a place to live. So the question then becomes do we find what we think could be a forever home? Because if the bubble does hit then we can't exactly trade up on equity. 

Thankfully we live in Ottawa and not crazy city like Toronto. But this is still in the back of my mind. Even 350k for a townhome that devalues to 250k would really suck. ",1541030665

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","One thing I'm surprised nobody has mentioned is how resistances scale. Even though the base damage spells deal doesn't scale much, neither does spell resistance. Meanwhile physical damage has to deal with ever scaling armour.

A level 1 hero before items has a median physical damage resistance of around 11.1%, bit has a magical resistance around 26.7%. There are a handful of items that boost magic resistance well, bit without these specialized items (or talents and abilities) most heroes end up in the mid low thirties of magic resistance by level 25. But they also end up in that area as far as armour goes. Add in the fact that armour items are much more common and this tends to balance things out and keep spell damage relevant.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I had another perspective that I haven't seen mentioned yet, and I think the new information makes it a bit more likely.

Your girlfriend is completely aware of her sisters's boyfriends inappropriate behavior but feels at risk of entering into conflict with her sister, and is just riding it out till it hopefully stops.

Women often learn to suck it up and not rock the boat, so much so that they will deny their own feelings and thoughts to themselves and others. Unable to acknowledge what is going on out of fear is not really about disrespecting you or your feelings, but primarily her own. 

The fact she is going to be a mother means she absolutely needs the support of her sister and family, she may feel she is risking that if she opens up this can of worms. Even if she can't articulate it at the moment.

Try to focus on helping her feel safe (snooping will not help that), make yourself emotionally available, dont't force the issue and don't make it about you when you finally talk about it. Realize that in this situation she is the most vulnerable one.

 Finally, keep a close eye on this creep. Keep your cool, realize that if you start a fight you will be on the back foot. He will fuck things up for himself eventually. Youre probably the most mature person in this dynamic and seeking advice and help is a good sign. Keep down that road and it will work out with time. 

I really don't think it's likely from how you describe the situation, but worst case scenario she is/was cheating then that will come out eventually regardless of snooping, worrying or interrogating. Letting that tiny possibility get to you will cloud your ability to deal with the situation optimally. 

Sorry this is happening to you. Keep in mind it will likely seem a very small matter in a few years. 'Drama' is sometimes a good learning opportunity if nothing else. ",1541030666

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","I don't think my womanhood is defined by my 'genetics,' or whatever, or my bone structure (lol) there's lots of variation in female biology. I do agree with that though and I am apprehensive about just accepting people as the gender they claim because anyone who was seen by society as male did benefit from male privilege, however I'd argue that's no different from the asymmetry in privilege between different kinds of women, black women and white women for example. I do think that a trans person doesn't just transition for the sake of it, I think its such a big thing they kind of need a big reason to force themselves to do it, so I'm inclined to believe them. 

I don't think that's the case medical science has some pretty clear ideas as to why gender dysphoria exists alot of them relating to hormone levels in their mother's womb. From this perspective I think we can see being gender dysphoria as being *slightly* a medical condition, and we do know the cure, letting trans people transition to whatever gender they want. I do think there is a weird asymmetry between trans men and trans women, I think that's a feminist issue, trans men are seen as almost going up the gender hierarchy, but trans women are seen as going down. Plus I guess its easier to spot a trans man in a way. 

I don't think that this makes trans people and their existence and how we should treat them an open debate when the science around it is pretty conclusive. Is this the bit where I can say facts don't care about your feelings?",1541030666

The disconnect from how I press the buttons verse how my brain thinks how I press the buttons causes me to blame the game rather than myself because in the end i always think i pressed the right buttons but when really I didn't.

"Ultralight","t5_2s7p2","I really want to recommend the MHW Stretch Ozonic (jacket) so often, but ultimately it's a city rain coat. The Dry.Q technology MHW deploys here is based on GE's eVent, and it suffers from the contamination problem. The oleophobic coating does not do a good enough job, and Gore was right to put a mono poly layer in there to protect the ePTFE membrane.

You can generally wash it often to maintain its waterproofness, but if you're on a long through-hike it won't stay waterproof, which is what relegates it to being a city coat.

The jacket is a bit more reasonable than the pants. Pants are very hard to do right. When I was looking at the Stretch Ozonic pants i person I deemed them too flimsy, and I hated the full length storm flap. But I go off-trail pretty often so my pants see more abuse than the average maybe?

I agree with you, it's a good idea, but the execution is not quite right. The old Stretch Ozonic jacket also had triceps zips rather than pit zips too, they were tiny and on the arm, not in the armpit. The new model does fix this I think.

It can also be really hard to determine if you're seeing a leak due to a contaminated membrane, a manufacturing issue, damage, or bad design.

At this point I recommend the OR Interstellar (OR Bolin for pants), it should be just as breathable, it is fairly light, but it should not suffer from the same membrane contamination issues.

Don't give up on MHW yet! For 2019 they have cut any Columbia influence out of their lineup, and they are returning to the highest quality possible. Across soft goods and hard goods. So I'm going to give them one more chance through the end of 2019.",1541030667

"coms30007","t5_3ont8","Instead of looking at matrices, let's look at vectors first.
We want to inspect the function f: R -&gt; R which maps a scalar to a scalar. We also assume that this function can be decomposed as f(x) = g(h(x)) such that g: R^N -&gt; R and h: R -&gt; R^N, that is, h maps a scalar to a vector and g maps the vector back to a scalar. For simplicity, we also assume that all three functions are differentiable everywhere. Also, we denote v = h(x).

The chain rule tells us that in this case, the gradient of f can be decomposed as well. Specifically, d/dx f(x) = (d/dv g(v))(d/dx v) = (d/dv g(v))(d/dx h(x)). Note that there is a matrix (or dot) product between those two terms. Instead of a scalar derivative, we now look at Jacobian matrices D. For vector-valued functions they are defined as follows: The Jacobian Dg of the function g(v) is a matrix with entries given by (Dg)ij = dgi/dvj. That is, the ij-th entry contains the partial derivative of the i-th entry of g by the j-th entry of v. Depending on who you ask, the Jacobian could also be defined as the transpose of that matrix.

In our case, Dg has the shape 1xN as g has a 1-dimensional output and an N-dimensional input. Analogously, Dh has the shape Nx1. We can now reformulate: d/dx f(x) = (d/dv g(v))(d/dx h(x)) = (Dg)(Dh). This is a normal matrix multiplication and results in a scalar, just as we wanted.

Now you asked about matrices instead of vectors. So we assume that g: R^(NxN) -&gt; R and h: R -&gt; R^(NxN). Now we have a problem. If we would try to define a generalization for Jacobians which applies to functions mapping matrices to matrices, this ""Hyperjacobian"" would not be a matrix. Indeed, it would be a fourth-rank tensor (A matrix whose entries are matrices of matrices. A 4D-array in numpy.) for which notation get's quite unwieldy. The good news is: In this case, the rules kind of stay the same. We can use a more general version of the chain rule which results in a tensorproduct of these ""hyperjacobians"" which cancels the 4 dimension out, quite the same way as in the vector case and we get back a scalar in the end.

This strangeness is the reason that Carl showed you the notation using indices instead of whole matrices. If you combine index notation with the Einstein summation convention you can actually write down derivatives of matrix-valued functions by other matrices in a comparatively readable way. But I would say that is out of scope of this course. Just know that the math checks out and more or less works equivalently to the vector case.",1541030670

shipments of pc shouldnt have declined since then so we probably have a case where lenovo alone sold just as much stuff this year as Apple's ipad and laptop line put together.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","12 team, 1 point PPR. $50 ante per team

The following trade went down in my league:

**Team A STOLE**: Tyreek Hill and Lamar Miller

**Team B Gets**: Alex Collins and Julian Edelman

At face value, this trade is lopsided (and that's putting it mildly)

Mind you team A already has Mahomes, Conner, A. Brown, E. Sanders, AND CMC.

I immediately pulled the Team B owner aside and said, ""WTF are you doing, bro?"" You're feeding the most talented team in the league an WR1 for players that were always going to ride the pine on his team.

His response, ""I need an RB and Alex Collins has a pretty decent matchup this week?""

My response: JackieChanWTFFace.JPG. ""You should have asked for atleast CMC""

He mentioned that the Team A owner was unwilling to do that, so they settled on this trade.

Of course, not enough people in my league vetoed this deal, so now Team A has a superteam that is only going to suffer slightly if/when Lev Bell comes back.

Shit like this is what makes me hate fantasy football, TBH. You do what you can to honestly build a decent team, get hot and win a few games and look like a decent playoff contender, then boom a freaking joke of a trade goes through and nothing is done about it.

"Gamingcirclejerk","t5_2sf2b","RPG.net decided to ban any talk of Trump from the site. They came out and stated that they are not taking a Democrat/Republican side, and that they still welcome people talking about politics in a civil way. However they feel Trump is racist, and that has bleed into a lot of his supporters. Thus they feel that the more vocal Trump supporters have been running people off the website, they put a foot down and said they are banning talk about Trump.

Now this did bring out the normal, ""omg you can't do that! MAGA EVERYTHING!"" folks. And I've seen a few people pull the, ""I don't support Trump however you can't take away someones freedom of speech and ban this as it's a slippery slope.""

My two cents? I'm fucking glad to see this. I feel a lot of communities have just gotten overly toxic thanks in part to the whole freedom of speech line along with the normal grow a thicker skin comments or the wonderful, ""Oh let them go off, they will get bored and do something else."" And in this case? The RPG community when I was in it allowed *anyone* in it. We didn't care if you are a man, woman, white, brown, black, gay, bi... As long as you are not *that guy* (look it up on 1d4chan) we'd be more then happy to have you playing D&amp;D, Shadowrun, Rifts, Magic, Vampire or whatever.

Rift 2 isn't cancelled. Its delayed/postponed for technical or a slight possiblity for cost reasons  Anyone who watched Abrashs' OC5 keynote should have already known this. It looks like Iribe wanted the 4kx4k, 140¬∫, variable focus, Eyetracking with Foveated Rendering CV2 he was working on to launch about 2020 no matter the pricepoint. Facebook preffered to wait till 2022 to make an even better CV2 according to Abrash at OC5 and be able to sell it for less cost and they want to launch an intergenerational Rift 1.5/S at the midway point in 2019. If I had a choice I would prefer if they had sided with Iribe. I'd pay $1000 for that HMD in 2020. However I totally understand why they didn't and will be happy enough with a Rift S to tide me over till my mind gets truly blown away by Rift 2 in 2022.",1541030674

"zen","t5_2qhmf","Respectfully, I think you have a very naive view of religion if you think the question of whether Mormonism is a form of Christianity is so simple that you can dispose of it with a single paragraph about how they believe in another source of revelation besides the canonical Bible.

You know who else believes in that?  Catholics, Quakers, Christian Scientists, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Orthodox - pretty much everyone other than mainstream protestants.  And sure, all of those groups get called ~~not-zen~~ heretical too.  And other than the Quakers, they're pretty much calling everyone else heretical too.  Every Christian church has at least some bitter cranks who thinks other Christians shouldn't count.  But most sectarians think everyone other than themselves is ~~not-zen~~ a heretic, right?

"vaxxhappened","t5_3p3pv"," That's desperation in action. It's a common trait with people who are having their world view shattered.  
  
 It starts with confidence in their stance, then when they realise that their stance was mistaken, they step back and throw a new 'fact' they are confident of. When that proves to also be false they start to throw 'facts' they are less and less sure of until, at last, they are willing to cling to the most insane, illogical and vague ideas imaginable to keep themselves afloat. I think this is how these massive generalisations that cannot be disproved due to their sheer volume become popular, because when everything you think you know is easily shown to be false, you cling to things that cannot be so easily dismissed because they are so vast and open ended that proving or disproving them is impossible.  
  
 For example: ""Vaccinated children are more sick than non-vaccinated children.""  
  
 Obviously we know this isn't true, but proving it is borderline impossible. With the relatively small number of anti-vaxxers, any amount, positive or negative, is going to make the percentage of them that is sick/well seem huge compared to 90% of the population of the world, where everything will average out. Plus, who is even performing this massive study? I don't know about you, but any time or money I have would be better spent then in checking the dubious medical history of a group of people notorious for refusing medical help.  
  
 So, the more you question them and show them they are incorrect, the deeper they are forced to go until they find those insane ideas that cannot be easily tested against.",1541030674

The sidebar doesn't even show up half the time anymore based on what browser you're using and what kind of mood reddit servers are in, not to mention that tonnes of what does occasionally show up is out of date and not really helpful in any way to someone just looking for a place to get started. You added literally nothing by posting your scathing 4 word response, keep it to yourself next time.

OP, my advice would be to drop the idea of ""learning java"" and come up with an idea of what you want to do with Java. Something very simple, then start researching how to do it. If you take aim and look to learn a language for the sake of learning it then you're going to spend a lot of time spinning your wheels and not really grasping concepts.

Having said that, if you're hell bent on trying to take it all in from a course then edX java courses from Harvard are very good, namely the HarvardX CS50 course found [here](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).",1541030674

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","&gt;Yes, but so is the concept of being in a key. We use the words ""diatonic"" and ""chromatic"" to refer to these constructs, with ""diatonic"" referring to notes in this thing we call a key, whether major or minor, and ""chromatic"" referring to the notes outside the key

See, here is our disagreement. From my perspective, ""diatonic"" and ""chromatic"" both refer to collections of pitch classes. This is a stretch from their original meaning, when ""diatonic"" and ""chromatic"" were both used to describe tetrachords. But I still find it useful to have these terms to talk about *collectional* properties because we have other language (""borrowing"" and so on) to talk about the role of notes within a tonal system. I'm interested in the diatonic *collection* that both major and natural minor scales represent. I'm interested in being able to make observations about collectional properties--e.g. each interval class has a unique cardinality in the diatonic collection; (014) and (048) are not diatonic subsets, etc. The use of ""diatonic"" to mean ""in the key"" is a bit of semantic slippage, one which stems from the fact that *if* a note is part of the diatonic collection, then of course it's part of the key. A note that's from outside the key is ""chromatic"" because it only exists in the chromatic superset that diatonic collections are a part of.

Relatedly, we can also speak of ""the diatonic modes"" which, I think everyone would agree, do not include the modes of harmonic or melodic minor.

&gt;frequency of use is not the determinator. If it were, we'd also have to consider the b2 diatonic,

See, I think that this is an argument in *my* favor. Because surely you'd agree that raised 7 in minor is *much* more common than the Neapolitan chord, or even a Picardy third. From my perspective, your usage of ""diatonic"" admits *some* non-diatonic elements into the word's umbrella because of their ubiquity. But that changes the question from one of strictly-defined theoretical concepts (diatonic = set class 7-35) to one of frequency, where different people might make different judgments about what is common *enough* to count as ""in the key.""

Ultimately I'm fine with the fact that we use ""diatonic"" differently depending on what context we're working in. And that most of the time there's no ambiguity if you use ""diatonic"" to mean ""in the key."" But if we're going to stake out sides, my side is that ""diatonic = sc7-35"" is conceptually prior to ""diatonic = in the key""; and it's more useful because it gives us vocabulary to talk about other issues, while we have plenty of other terms for talking about issues of keys and tonality.",1541030677

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","&gt; What does this mean exactly?

They are informing you that you in default, willingly, and are basically putting you on notice that they might get a debt collector, and/or take you to court.

The CCA 1974 means they need to send you some documents or the loan isn't enforceable in court and interest can't be recovered for that period they are in default.

&gt; Since I have moved and changed my number, they do not know where I am living and are unable to contact me via phone.

These days it is pretty easy to engage a tracing agent to find you.

But in any case, they can serve documents to your last known address (if you don't keep them up to date) and that will be good service, and the CCJ will be obtained by default.

&gt; My question is, what kind of legal action can they take against me and what's a worse case scenario for me at this point?

They really want the money, get a CCJ and then get it taken out of your wages - they summon you to court and when you don't turn up you get arrested.

But that's unlikely to happen (the last bit) - they'll get their CCJ and then try and send round the bailffs (or maybe not even then): this is a high risk area of lending, and the rates are high because people default.

&gt; Also, an additional question that is not law related but someone may be able to answer: Is my credit rating pretty much fucked now for life?

No - only 6 years.

You might find that talking to Stepchange about coming to an informal arrangement with the creditors means there's no CCJ and they freeze the interest - don't worry about the defaulted parts on your credit report, just having a payday lender on your record ruins your credit for the next few years anyway.",1541030681

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","I think this last episode made me see 13 more clearly than the previous episodes, specially when compared to the Twelfth Doctor. Twelve was a really tired Doctor, he couldn't bear the thought of losing more people and he was ready to die if given the opportunity to do also, once he hears of his ghost in *Before The Flood*, he accepts it instantly and even states that his regeneration was a mistake. I truly believe this Doctor was suicidal and he was just looking for a good heroic death and after losing Bill and sending Nardole to die saving those kids, I think he had enough. 

We all know about the theory of ''The next Doctor's persona is defined by the flaws and qualities of the previous' one'' and with 13 I really feel like it's one of the strongest cases of this theory. 12 was tired of losing people and 13 seems desperate to have friends and to treat them as family, at the beginning of episode four she seems to be fighting the urge to invite them in, but when Yaz invites her for tea, she instantly joins them. She values friendship and can't seem to be without them, because she knows that being alone leads her to deal with the loneliness and pain that was inflicting Twelve, so she needs to keep herself busy around other people. 

Analysing like this give me the impression that Chib may do a rehash of what happened to the Tenth Doctor. Nine regenerated into a man that could love and be better for Rose and once he lost her, he slowly began to fall into depression, which got worse after losing Donna. I think the same will happen to 13...she was born to be a better friend and more passionate than her previous version, once that doesn't work out the way she is expecting, who knows what happens.

Oh, and also from what I know about hard inquiries, when the lender takes a look at those, I think they actually analyze what they‚Äôre from versus just how many you have.

As opposed to the units (Pikmin) being deployed from stationary spawn points on a fixed trajectory, Olimar acts as a ""movable cursor"" where he not only directly controls his units but can also deploy them in a variety of ways.  You can also see shades of this philosophy in Splatoon.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say this way of design is Nintendo's claim to fame.  They innovate by making complex mechanics more approachable, while adding their own unique charm.  Their influence on game design is immeasurable.",1541030684

As for what you do against anti-armor units: do your best to fight them with Triangle Advantage (e.g. Hector should fight Card as but not Frederick and ideally not Clair). That way, the damage they'll do will he significantly mitigated. Use defensive tiles to your advantage, and you may even take 0-10 damage. If you can OHKO them on Player Phase, kill them then. If they've got Bold Fighter, try engaging on PP as well so they don't double you (if you can ORKO them).

*Doubt* 

I lie in the clearing. My mouth tastes of ash, and my hair is wild around my face. I think I‚Äôve been up all night ‚Äì or maybe I‚Äôve slept. I don‚Äôt remember. 

I hear her call my name. It is an animal sound, a gasp wrenched from the depths of her body, and she staggers towards me. I blink and scramble to my feet. 

‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù she is saying.

She reaches out to help me tame my wild hair, but I jerk away from her touch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI just need a minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not,‚Äù she insists. She steps towards me, but I evade her. 

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I finally beg. ‚ÄúJust-‚Äú 

But I cannot name what she should just not do. It would hurt her.

‚ÄúI see you‚Äôve been busy,‚Äù she says apprehensively, casting her eyes around the clearing. The chalk-lines, oriented to the cardinal directions. The polished stones I have left there. My book on the ground‚Äì she bends and picks me up.

She doesn‚Äôt have to open it to know what‚Äôs inside. She stares, then hands it to me with a shake of her head.

‚ÄúYou know that he‚Äôll kill you if he finds out about this,‚Äù she says. 

I laugh

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that I WANT to be out here, all alone, in this freezing-ass long night, supplicating the demons. I sometimes think death would be preferable to the burden it is, to do this.‚Äù

She grimaces. 

‚ÄúHow is she?‚Äù I ask, far too nervously, in my own estimation.

She sets her lips.

‚ÄúBetter,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMuch better. Doctors think she‚Äôll be out of the hospital in a couple of days. She took a real turn ‚Äì ‚Äú

‚ÄúLast night,‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad.‚Äù

I examine my skin and dust myself free of the earth which still clings to it. 

We walk back to the house together, our footsteps muted against the grass. Her eyes are tender in the grey light, searching for mine, to offer comfort. Mine only ache; they sting with sleeplessness and fear, until they cannot perceive anything clearly. 

‚ÄúI knew you were doing this,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs soon as I got the call from the hospital, from him.‚Äù

I nod. 

‚ÄúHe thinks it‚Äôs his prayer, you know,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe went to mass yesterday.‚Äù

I nod.

‚ÄúMaybe it was,‚Äù I say, with a long sigh. ‚ÄúI hope so.‚Äù

She casts a sidelong glance.

‚ÄúDoubtful,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúGod doesn‚Äôt speak to him, or so he always complains. He never was much good with uncertainty.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the same, that way, my brother and I,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúAnd always will be.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll be somewhere in between the two of you, I guess.‚Äù

As the dawn breaks the horizon and touches her face, it illuminates her skin so gently, as though she is bathed in holy light. When I look behind us, the luminous haze around us glows until even our shadows disappear without a trace.

the world in undertale is legit amazing and you'll enjoy being there. also the game is short . ppl go out of their way to not like this game only cuz it attracts a huge crowd of ppl-- biggest champions of the game being tumblr pages and shit. just ignore all the outside shit and try it out. p.s. the game file is small af you can find it somewhere. also its cheap af. if you have a switch id recommend it on that but pc with mouse is great.",1541030693

Everything else is fine tbh. He is insanely fragile as a champion. When no minions are around the only way he can kill you is if you go for a straight up face to face damage trade (which you should always win early on unless you dont sidestep a single Q). Yasuo abuses people who dont know what to do against him. He also abuses lineups lacking CC. He is in a fine spot atm imo because Conquerer is not as opressive anymore. There are not that many high elo Yasuos for a reason. You need to understand how to play against him, otherwise you will lose. After only a year, you have 0 idea how to play the game.

Tanto autores angl√≥fonos como franc√≥fonos, apesar de serem bons em suas √°reas, s√£o bem pobres em argumenta√ß√£o e seus livros, por melhor que sejam, n√£o passam de panfletagem irreligiosa e anticlerical. Schopenhauer, por exemplo, acreditava numa vontade metaf√≠sica que regia tudo que fosse vivo; j√° Nietzsche, excluindo a premissa metaf√≠sica, propunha que a mesma for√ßa ontol√≥gica motriz que impera sobre seres n√£o sencientes √© a regra.

"EmDrive","t5_32vrh","Ahh, we may be talking past each other a little here. When scientists talk about getting a paper published, i think they are almost always talking about ""a paper in a peer reviewed journal."" Additionally, most (all?) reputable and respected journals (in my field at least) won't publish anything that has been published anywhere before. Even on a website.

The end result is that peer reviewed journals are really the major collected source of new scientific publication and research. If a scientist self publishes this work on their own website, it's either some sort of special permission, or they are basically announcing they couldnt get published in a reputable journal. Not a good look! 

In the case we are discussing, though, since null results are not likely to get published anyway, I guess people could organize and publish this null result paper on their own website. Or Facebook. Or linked in. But you can see how this is really quite different, and tends to scatter the null result articles across a million different websites while concentrating the positive results (some of which are statistical artifacts rather than true results) on the journals.

Edit: I thought of something else. You wrote ""It doesn't have to be peer reviewed to be published, but just saying, ""it didn't work"" and publishing nothing really isn't a good approach either. It's just as bad as Shawyer saying the EM Drive works here's a youtube video as proof.""

I think this is missing something important. Basically, in science, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. So yeah, I'd want to see really compelling evidence that a reaction less drive worked. But the flip side is not true. I don't need to see overwhelming evidence that heating a copper cone *doesn't* make it move. That's exactly what I'd expect!

I would 100% agree with you, though, that some amount of evidence would be appreciated! It's just nowhere near as bad as shawyers actions if it was not (IMO)! ",1541030698

"Creation","t5_2t3sv","I just demonstrated the error in materialism, compatibilism etc. and then you ask me to demonstrate the error. What is up with that? There is an error shown that compatibilism ends up with equivocation between fact and opinion. 

You cannot say the same for compatibilism. The logic doesn't work out, you get equivocation between fact and opinion, so that an opinion must be a subcategory of fact. On materialist terms the opinion that a painting is beautiful, is a statement of fact of a love for the way the painting looks existing in the brain. Then what materialists argue is that the love is fact, but that there is also an experience of love. But that is merely complexifying a problem without providing a solution. The existence of the experience is fact yet again, because everything must be factual in materialism. 

Your points reasoning is meaningless. It is demonstrated creationism best explains reality by examples already given, of Jack choosing to run away out of cowardice, the opinion that a painting is beautiful, etc. all already demonstrated many times.

When you object to 2, then you cannot say the phrase Jack chose to run away out of cowardice, or say you can vote for either Trump or Clinton to become president. Your argument that this can be done on compatibilist terms is shown to equivocate fact and opinion, it is an error. You are just using the authority of philosophers to say it is possible, and dismissing common discourse as irrelevant. That is how most philosophers argue, I am a materialist and ofcourse I can be subjective, they prove nothing. Well ofcourse they can but only by using creationist logic. ",1541030699

&gt;So I would like to discuss what typical ""recruiter etiquette"" consists of.

Avoid recruiters unless you have no other choice. Someone has to be paying them, guess who it is... and they're not working on your interests. They're used car salesmen, and your the customer. Don't get confused by the arrangement.

&gt;‚Ä¢ Can/Should I outright ask a recruiter about salaries for companies they are calling on behalf of?

This should be your first question in regards to any job recruiter or otherwise. If they're not willing to talk about it, don't bother going in. They're afraid you'll run when you hear it, so don't wait around for the bad news.


&gt;‚Ä¢ How open/upfront/blunt should I be about opportunities I may be interested in? Do I risk burning bridges if I tell them that I am straight up not interested?

I wouldn't tell them anything about what you're interested in, they'll never stop calling you. If you're at an actual employer, they will respect a calm, professional answer. ""Oh, you're mostly still working in Cobol? That's cook, but not really the direction I'm headed. When you're ready to migrate give me a call.""

&gt;
&gt;‚Ä¢ What do I tell them when they ask if I know anyone who might be interested in the job? I don't really see why I should put any effort into finding a candidate for them, seems like that‚Äôs their job. But maybe it garners goodwill for other opportunities later?

Your friends will hate you.

&gt;
&gt;‚Ä¢ If they come back and tell me that a job is within the salary range I may be interested in, can I push them for more information on other forms of compensation or do I need to go through the whole application/interview process with a company for that? (example: working hours, on call, PTO, health benefits, 401k matching, etc?)

The recruiters will lie to you. Nothing they say can be trusted. Assume all of it is a lie. 

&gt;
&gt;‚Ä¢ If they ask how much i currently make, should i tell them an accurate number?
&gt;

You should tell them it's none of their business. **NEVER** tell someone you're interviewing with what you *used to make.* you're there to talk about what they're going to pay you.

&gt;What are some other things that I can do to improve my experiences with recruiters in the future and keep doors open
&gt;

As they call, make sure to take careful note of all their names and numbers. Keep a list, don't forget where it is. Then, after you land your first job and realize what recruiters really are, pull out that list and block the entire lot of them so they'll stop bothering you.

"crashbandicoot","t5_2tgip","Hello there, Rob Titus! Here are some questions for you:





&amp;nbsp;




**1.** Is there anything you would change in the originals and CTR? Like someone else said in this thread, being able to collect the gems and then dying to go back to the checkpoint without finishing the Death Route, for example. Or would you keep these things intact?





&amp;nbsp;





**2.** This question just popped in my head as I was writting the previous question: What is the name of the routes where you can't die once in the level in order to reach it? Is it ""Death Route"" or ""Skull Route""?






The N. Sane Trilogy calls them ""Death Routes"", but is that what they were originally intended to be called? I'm not sure if this was ever confirmed in any official sources, but which one is correct? 







If there was never any name given to them, what name do you prefer? I like ""Death Route"" better, because it sounds a lot more menacing.






&amp;nbsp;





**3.** A lot of people say that Warped had way too many ""vehicle"" levels. What are your thoughts on the matter?




&amp;nbsp;





**4.** This is kind of a weird question, but anyway. Since you've worked on CTR, did you ever notice during development that Papu Papu's icon kind of looks like Papu Papu's chin is a smile and that the mouth is a red nose?





 








I was really confused why Papu Papu looked so goofy and had a clown nose in his icon. It took me a long time to realize that that's not what it was supposed to be. I'm not the only one who thought this, some other people have as well!






&amp;nbsp;

Chrono Trigger sold 289,000.  That means that Chrono Trigger it is only about 1/3 less common or there are roughly 6.5 copies for every 10 copies of FFIII.  Given that C.T. is not a significantly better game (if you even consider it better), it should be worth roughly 1.5x as much as FFIII.  

FFIII = $35;  C.T. = $90

$35 x 1.5=  $52.5

Therefore, Chrono Trigger is nearly twice what it should really be worth.  I agree that it is a good game, but clearly, it is way too much affected by hype.

"pokemongo","t5_34jka","People play this game differently. Not all of them take it seriously or care for Iv or breakpoints and skillset match up. I see people walking their Pidgeottos and Sunfloras for no reason other than they like them. I see people who just get an excuse to go outside and exercise or take a break from work. I once traded a &lt;something&gt; for a Arcanine and the kid said he was so happy to make that trade he's willing giving up his favorite pokemon he had at the time. I dont' even remember what it was I gave him, he got really excited and felt it was only fair that he give up his buddy. I felt bad for taking his Arcanine but he insisted. Almost thought twice about turning that Arcanine into candy, but I did so anyway. Yeah, literally taking candy from a kid. I'm a monster ;-)

The point is, you're lucky enough to have a town where you can get enough people together for a L5 raid, which is a lot more than some people have. If you enjoy the game, keep enjoying, but just also let other people have fun the way they want. ",1541030704

No, they wouldn't have. Copying and stealing are two very different things and copying in the manner they have doesn't open themselves to any kind of law suit. 

&gt; So before you start criticising other games for allegedly copying, maybe look at the game you're so eager to cry about others supposedly ripping off why don't you?

Who is exactly crying here? I don't think I've indicated anything of the sort nor have I really said such much more than a sentence on the matter. I don't have any real allegiance to either Overwatch nor Paladins, I was just comically making a statement. 

With all that said, it's quite clear Paladins used Overwatch as a template, trying to emulate the same art style, gameplay, characters (some of the designs in particular are obviously based straight off of Overwatch's) and even many of the abilities themselves. Paladins won't be the first game to do it, many have before and many will again. The extent at which a game copies another is important, Paladins has done so, like I said in way which isn't infringing directly on Overwatch's IP or physically taken any of their assets.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","i think he meant, is that you said you said you have some mobility issues. You also said that a knife or sword would be your preferred defense weapon. While it may be true that an attacker is more likely to use your own weapon against you especially if you arent as spry as you once were that also applies to knives and you have to let your attacker get close before you can fend them off with it which is a riskier proposition than being able to get them with a pistol from a distance. if you are worried about your personal safety and not very able to physically  fend someone off, a knife would be a poor choice compared to a firearm. 

im just trying to flesh out the point he indicated.  personally i do have a couple firearms because my dad was a good marksman and liked to bring me along  with him when i was a kid and teach me. we would do that at as a fun activity on the weekends  and i still have fun trying to put holes in paper.  i dont worry about personal defense that much because your gun should be the last line of defense and there are so many precautions to take that should guarantee you dont have to use it.

Hey, thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.

About a month ago a lost a good friend because of what I told her.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a long story, but shes taking an extra year of high school to finish up her courses since her move from the states to Canada put her behind. She was the Stage Manager (kind of like an assistant to the director, who was the teacher) for the Performing arts program she loved. All her friends were in it, she'd been doing it the whole time she was at this school but started causing problems this fall.

&amp;#x200B;

She kept telling actors they were ""acting wrong"", getting mad and insulting people, and getting angry with the director. She was warned that not changing her actions would result in her getting booted from the program. She didn't change, and like she was told she was no longer welcome there.

&amp;#x200B;

She texted me saying that she got kicked out after I heard (and verified through both people who like her and people who don't) what had happened, but she said that she got kicked out because everyone hated her.

I told her that's not true.

She has a history of always being the victim, and sometimes she is but as one of her only friends I tend to stick up to her and at least when I'm talking to her support her side of the story.

This time, I knew what had happened and I decided I needed to say something before she went too far down her current path and ended up with no career or life.

&amp;#x200B;

So I said, in roughly these words ""I think that maybe you need to hold yourself accountable for your actions. Sometimes, you aren't the victim and this time I think that you are the sole person responsible for what happened"". 

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't take too kindly to that, and while I kept trying to say similar things nicely she kept saying ""oh you're gossiping with \[person that doesn't like her\] behind my back, you are a terrible friend, maybe you should listen to me before believing other people like everyone else"" and other such things.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the asshole? Should I have let her believe she was wronged? Or was it right of me to try and help show her that sometimes people, including her, make mistakes and should hold themselves accountable for their actions?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

Print out the new criteria from [https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/) and have your doctor go over it with you.

Expect a geneticist to take a family history, a medical history, and run through the criteria on that checklist. They may order genetic testing just in case depending on their findings. It will be a clinical diagnosis, which is ""looks like a duck, quacks like a duck"" affair. 

Remember that people can and do live a relatively normal life. You might have to make some adaptions, but EDS isn't usually disabling in and of itself. I've met, lawyers, and engineers that go to work every day just fine that are diagnosed with the condition.",1541030710

Most of the time, teams that breaks through even dynasties, have year of trying to break through before they do it. If you're expecting a 20 year old who has barely 20 games of NBA experience, a 22 year old barely in his 2nd official season and a 24 year old who is barely in his 3rd years to surpass teams with more experience than them. That's not how the NBA usually works. 

You mentioned the Iverson teams, at least his team went to the Finals and I believe as everything evolve and unfold, that could potentially have for the Sixers. The fact that they won 52 last year with no one expecting this to happen show the potential.

According to the [New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-manhattan-republican-club-vandalized-20181012-story.html), the note left by the vandals read;

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Hello Personal Finance Gurus. 

**Background**

I have just been transferred out to the US from the UK by my company and am preparing for a long term stay. The move is essentially permanent. I have obtained an SSN, a bank account and credit card with the company's credit union, and I am reasonably well remunerated. I have savings back in the UK (all with HSBC) and a house with mortgage there., which tenants will hopefully pay down, and a good history in the UK office of a well known blue chip US company.  

Before I arrived, I didn't quite appreciate how debilitating having no US credit score can be.

**Goals**

Short term: I have two weeks left on the hire car the company provided. I need a car because I am in LA. 

Longer term: I would like to develop a good credit score (over one or two years if possible) so that buying a house here is possible down the line. 

**Questions**

1. I have one credit card with the credit union at work. Will opening additional US accounts eg at Chase and obtaining additional credit cards assist me? Note - I do not intend to change my spending habits and will keep everything paid off immediately as I do in the UK.
2. I can see three ways of buying a car. The credit union has offered me a car loan at 6 percent APR. This is high because I have no credit rating in this country. But it still seems awfully high. I understand there are a few car brands that will offer a dodgy foreigner like me a lease - Audi, BMW - although I do not know the terms. THe last way is just cash which I can transfer from the UK. What would you guys recommend? Does paying down an auto  loan lead to a better credit score than paying a lease? Will just using credit cards be enough to raise my score so I can just buy a car with cash rather take a usurious loan?
3. Are there any other good ways of raising my score? A friend even recommended a spotify account.  

Any help / abuse welcome and thank you in advance.

Loomis was crazy about trying to KILL Michael‚ÄîSartain was crazy about seeing Michael himself, kill. He wanted to try to figure out what made Michael the way he was and he‚Äôd achieve that any way he could, just like Loomis would do whatever he needed to to try and kill Michael. I thought it was a good parallel. Also, Laurie had a shotgun‚Äîshe used it to shoot off Michael‚Äôs fingers, and she was carrying it the rest of the movie till she lost it later in the fall.

I plan to go from 2 flagship phones to 4 (currently have a iPhone X &amp; s9+ now, adding the 6t &amp; a V40 in the next few weeks) as I do tech support &amp; having one of each brand is super helpful walking people through the phone settings.

"technology","t5_2qh16","We begged for it in Canada for years as well (fun fact: we used to have it many years ago), and now that we have it, many of the channels people might want to choose have been labeled as ""premium"" by cable providers.  That means they're exempt from a la carte pricing, and are often still bundled with other crap you may or may not want.  So it still costs an arm and a leg to get just the few channels you may want to watch.  Take a popular channel like HBO for instance.  At the cheapest possible price available to me, it would still cost $45/mo to access (basic cable + $20/mo for HBO).  Some people are unlucky enough to require Movie Central be purchased first in order to access HBO, which brings the cost up to $65/mo.  *For one fucking channel*.

Along with the CRTC mandating a la carte be offered, they also mandated that each provider offer a basic cable package for no more than $25/mo.  The big providers will do everything they can to prevent you from choosing that option, including lying about it even being available.  To make it even more annoying, most of the channels included in those basic packages can be watched for free OTA anyways.",1541030716

I don't know what country you are from, but as far as I know being gay and living in a country that prosecutes LGBTQ people with punishments that lead to their deaths is a guaranteed reason for a granted refugee status in Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

Only problem is that we Germans are taking in a lot of refugees right now and we might not be able to handle all these people in a way that our famous German efficiency might suggest.

That means it could take some time to handle each individual case. And our government officials make mistakes in some cases. But the law is pretty clear in cases like yours.

&amp;#x200B;

O.K. there is another problem:  German is a horrible difficult language to learn. I say this a a German teacher, who has given language classes for refugees before. 

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously: Flee from your country! You don't have to go to Germany, but to any country that grants refugee status for being LGBTQ. Another possibility I can think of might be Canada, but that might be harder to reach. France is also an option. Or the really friendly Nordic nations, like Denmark, Norway, Sweden - seriously I don't know why, but these countries may be some of the friendliest places on earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Well this is not a competition, just a suggestion!

And the only advice I can give you is: RUN!

Go to ANY country that would grant you refugee status!",1541030716

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","&gt;That portion of the amendment was settled by the case in 1898. There isn‚Äôt an open question here to reinterpret.

Read the opinion.  
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/169/649/  
&gt; The words ""not subject to any foreign power"" do not, in themselves, refer to mere territorial jurisdiction, for the persons referred to are persons born in the United States.   All such persons are undoubtedly subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and yet the act concedes that nevertheless they may be subject to the political jurisdiction of a foreign government. In other words, by the terms of the act, all persons born in the United States, and not owing allegiance to any foreign power, are citizens.  
The allegiance of children so born is not the local allegiance arising from their parents' merely being domiciled in the country, and it is single and not double, allegiance.  Indeed, double allegiance, in the sense of double nationality, has no place in our law, and the existence of a man without a country is not recognized.  
But it is argued that the words ""and not subject to any foreign power"" should be construed as excepting from the operation of the statute only the children of public ministers and of aliens born during hostile occupation.  

Even within that judgement, there is potential wriggle room.  
It appears that Trump is setting the rhetoric to use it. ""Invasion"" ""Enemy"" ""Hostile"", etc.  
Can an ""invasion"" occur when the invaders are not armed?  
Can a large group that immediately settles in one area after arriving in a sovereign territory be considered to have ""invaded"" that area?

&gt;And Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the court, in analyzing the first clause, observed that ""the phrase 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls and citizens or subjects of foreign States, born within the United States.""  
That eminent judge did not have in mind the distinction between persons charged with diplomatic functions and those who were not, but was well aware that consuls are usually the citizens or subjects of the foreign States from which they come, and that, indeed, the appointment of natives of the places where the consular service is required, though permissible, has been pronounced objectionable in principle.  
His view was that the children of ""citizens or subjects of foreign States,"" owing permanent allegiance elsewhere and only local obedience here, are not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States than are their parents.",1541030719

Sure, I didn't buy a smartphone for at least 2 years after they released. I wanted to use my phone for texting and calling, and nothing else. I aknowledge this. My reasons were also valid at the time, as the early smartphones were pieces of shit. This is very much different. You know, ponzi schemes [can go for ages, even when blatantly obvious.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal). The train already left, the ""MEGA GAINZ"" has already been had by the ones adopting early.

Secondly, you need to contextualize those numbers. The fact that Lebron and Steph are anomalies doesn't mean you can just compare them head to head with no adjustment. This type of comparison would only make sense if basketball were an individual sport. This is a rotational based statistic and therefore Curry can't take all the credit for the slight lead he possesses over Lebron. Curry plays a majority of his minutes alongside a group of net positive players. Lebron does not. What portion of Curry's +16.9 from last year should be credited to him, and what portion should be credited to the net positive players that he also plays a majority of his minutes with? Its easier to answer that question for Lebron, especially last year. 

The Durant numbers justify my argument. Although his 2018 on/off wasn't that stellar, he's still a clear net-positive player, and plays a majority of his minutes with Steph. 

Also, these numbers aren't really that definitively pro-Steph. Aside from the 2018 season, they're pretty close across the board. When you contextualize for teammates I feel like these numbers might favor Lebron, aside from 2018. Still, I respect the empirical approach, and if your gut tells you that this set of data should weigh strongly in evaluating the best player argument, then I could appreciate the argument.

Your solider example is horrendous, you can negate slow pool effects with a soldier by shooting them from range. You. Can‚Äôt. Do. That. With. A. Melee. Focused. Ninja. Relying. On. Melee. Eliminations. From. Melee. Weapons. In. Melee.. Range. To. Maximize. Their. Damage. 

Keep playing your melee ninja, I‚Äôll stick to what is more fun, and more suitable for my playstyle, dragon ninjas, all while being more effective in any mission and any modifier, than your melee ninja. It‚Äôs okay to have preferences, and have heroes you ENJOY playing, that‚Äôs the whole point of the game, to play what you like.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","What TECHNICAL reason is there it couldn't release TODAY on PC?

It would run like ass because it isn't optimized for the hardware, but realistically it could come out on PC today, how do you think it was developed? Hint, it was on PCs, just decently powerful ones to get over the fact it's not optimized. 

Realistically, they never planned to release it at the same time as Xbox/PS4, so they never bothered optimizing it for PC (and they probably could have), now what they'll likely do is spend the next 12-18 months polishing the fuck out of it, and adding further graphical enhancements (increased foliage, more wildlife, etc) and then release it on PC when they're good and ready. And that's fine, but they're basically developing the game with that goal of double dipping in mind, it could have been developed with simultaneous release in mind coming out on PC and PS4/Xbox, but that requires more work and effort. 

All I am saying is that Rockstar made an economic choice to release this on Xbox/PS4 instead of PC, and it wasn't from some technical perspective, they could've taken their time to do it how many other companies do and release at the same time, they choose not to. We can argue semantics if you want, but to me that's double dipping.  ",1541030722

Maybe having just a generally good online presence with a well established email for people to reach out at.

It's how I've been approached by recruiters from all the Big N companies. I don't think they ever contacted me because I had applied. I have no idea what it takes to get contacted by Apple as they're the only one I can think of that hasn't ever reached out.

But maybe I'm understating one thing: Leetcode. Leetcode. Leetcode. Leetcode. Leetcode. Leetcode. Leetcode. Leetcode. I'm not going to attempt at making this into a gucci gang ripoff but seriously.

Where as here this is a product we choose to invest our time and money into and we rightfully as consumers expect a certain level of service for that money, part of that being reasonable and fair procedures that do not target innocent people unfairly. This is a company's policy and procedure that they have complete control over who they punish or don't. They have the capacity to change and improve this. They have the capacity to add features to avoid this situation or to allow a reasonable amount of recourse if someone is unfairly targeted. Or to simply change the policy and no longer issue bans but just revoke the gold from someone's account. I mean, that is what most other MMOs do.

There are posts of this going on back over 3 years, it's clear a bad policy or they don't have the ability to improve on it (or don't care).",1541030727

"iamverybadass","t5_386om","I grew up in a family that was incompetent and dysfunctional at best and actively abusive at worst, but I was also bullied at school. I never got jumped or beaten up or anything like that by other kids(I already got more than enough of that from practically every single adult in my family with a functional set of limbs) but I was still teased and made fun of for not being like everyone else and all the usual shit. But I'd say 98% of the bullying I endured at school was from arguably the worst possible source: my teachers, aka the people that should be working to *stop* bullying. Quickly going back my family, there seems to be this philosophy of sorts in our family that goes something like, ""is a kid out of line? Just beat the shit out of them and yell at them about how stupid and useless they are until they're fixed! And if they're pissed at you, or if they dare question anything, they're just dumb, ungrateful ne'er-do-wells who don't know what's good for them!"" Similar to my family, the school system I was educated in was, for the most part, incompetent at best, and actively abusive and neglectful at worst. And it seems a lot of my teachers applied that same philosophy as my family, except replacing corporal punishment with sending me to the office or trapping me in special Ed so they wouldn't have to deal with me, and of course, harassing my mom into medicating me beyond recognition to keep me in line(since I guess I didn't fit their mold of a ""normal"" student so they didn't know what else to do with me). Tbh though I'm willing to bet that if they *could* legally beat me up, they probably would, but anyway, I was usually just treated like a burden or like an untamed animal that no one wanted anything to do with, and it seemed like everyone would much rather just pass me off to someone else instead of actually doing something positive to try to help me. Unsurprisingly, since hatred begets hatred and anger begets anger, I eventually started resenting pretty much everyone and everything, *especially* authority, and developed some pretty nasty anger issues that still persist to this day, which of course the school and my parents wrote off as me being ""out of control,"" and so of course they just continued on with the same old bullshit, which of course only made it worse. There have also been a lot of times where I misinterpreted other people's genuine attempts to help me as just them trying to gain my trust so they can stab me in the back at the first opportunity they get. Tbh pretty much everything you said holds true in my case. But the somewhat positive things I got out of it all is that I quickly learned authority figures are far from infallible, even though they think they are, the system is definitely far from perfect, as much as the people that are a part of it will try to convince you that is, at least to some extent, how to stand up for myself against bullies, no matter who or what they are, and also that no matter what I do, I can't please everyone, so I shouldn't care what other people think. But the thing that arguably sucks the most is that all the anti-bullying campaigns and PSAs and whatnot are about stopping *kids from bullying each other,* but no one ever makes any campaigns or PSAs to stop *teachers* from abusing *their* power, at least none that I've seen. And I'm pretty sure even if a teacher did all the stereotypical stuff that bullies do, like verbal abuse(God knows how much of that I've endured over the years from teachers and family members alike), or physically beating me up(which thankfully I've only had to take from my family members) if I tried to complain about it to the office or something like that, there's a 99.99% chance they won't do jack shit. I remember my mom tried doing that with my kindergarten teacher (she hated her arguably even more than I did), who did a lot of stuff that probably would've been considered bullying had she been a student instead. And pretty much every single time, they just dismissed what she said almost like they handed her a letter saying:

*Dear Parent,*

*Our teachers are absolutely perfect and can't possibly do any wrong. If you think otherwise, you're completely full of shit and have no idea how to handle your kid. Now please do us a favor and go fuck yourself.*


*Sincerely,*

"KiAChatroom","t5_34hik","F**k the industry, the industry will do you without a second thought.

Preordering does make some sense when you wanna buy scarce goods. Preordering digital good makes no sense beyond supporting some indie.

As individual consumer, you are paying in advance for something you don't really know how good it is.

As a group, people who preorder encourage business people in the industry to think they can charge whatever they want, however they want for their products and come ahead, 'cos consumer will ride the hype train, will trade gold for colored shiny glass and later will brag about it.

I, like most of us, have preordered games. Sometimes it came out alright but that's not the rule. May be if we as consumers were more careful with our money, if why restraint ourselves off riding hype trains for years, if we decide buying on second week after relase is ok and small spoiler are not such a,big deal, stuff like in game monetization, always on-line or developers badmouthing their audience for politics would have never happen.

Only a few wanted to touch my fake hanging eye and a few parents asked how I made my eye cover.

I used Liquid latex, paints and napkins and 1 eye patch.

I drilled a small hole into the center of the eyepatch.

Put a string though it and tide a knot to make sure the string would not slip back through.

then put the other end of the string into the back of the fake eye.

I then used liquid latex and mixed with paint colors to make latex the color I wanted.

Took pieces of napkin and dunk them into the liquid latex, then shaped them on the eyepatch.

After it dried, covered rest in latex to make it look as natural as possible, left a gaping hole for the eye socket.

Waited till dried.

Made touch ups.

then when dry, tried on, trimmed to fit.

I took the money and gave it to my gf's mom at the time who bought us booze

I'm positive I used the sequel as the lie to get the money, I vividly remember my mother yelling at me because she knew I was obviously drunk ""so how was the movie was it any thing like the first?""

Man you Raptors fans are really something. The fact that you need to write an essay to explain to someone what good games Lowry has had in the playoffs is evidence enough that none of those performances were ""iconic"". Like you said, yall lost the 1st series, and Lowry had a chance to win it but didn't. A series-winning play is iconic. You beat a *lower seed* in the ECSF in 2016, a conference that everyone knew belonged to Lebron. Beating him would have been iconic.

I don't think he's bad in the playoffs. I watch avidly and am aware of his strong performances. But the public perception, which is what we're discussing, is that he is bad in the playoffs. It's like you all know he's underrated, yet when someone tries to present *why* he's underrated, you devolve into the classic inferiority complex brand of Raptors fans. Nobody watches us waaaaahhhh

&gt; The fact of the matter is, he is way better than people think

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","It doesn't seem intended to me either. I think Blizzard intended for wells to go down after you peel away the front wall. If that's true, this is a deviant strategy. Deviant strategies aren't inherently bad, but this is one that is impractical to defend against when you consider the number of resources required to prevent it. It simply isn't worth keeping one or two team members on well babysitting duty. This means Genji just kills them, and your team plays the rest of the game at a disadvantage. I doubt anyone considers this fun except the Genji player, and it doesn't bring any strategic depth to the game. As far as I'm concerned, protecting wells would reduce frustration for many players at literally no cost. It should be noted that this problem isn't unique to Genji- other characters are capable of doing this, he's just the well sniping poster boy. This is why I would rather give wells protection rather than address Genji specifically.",1541030730

So open your file browser.  Go to Current project. Select the right pattern. You will now see ""Sample - Channel volume"". Right click and edit events. Now select all and delete. Now it's gone. 

A faster way is just redrawing the entire volume line. Move until you find 50% in the beginning, you should have a tool text  that says 50%. Now click and hold. Go to the end and do the same thing. Now the entire line is at 50% volume again. But the fastest way is just making an empty FL Studio state file and drag and drop that.  And there is probably 20 more ways of doing it.

Usually this is because you haven‚Äôt spent enough time struggling with whatever problem the tool you are learning is trying to solve.

It‚Äôs like someone shows you a hammer and says ‚Äúif you swing this thing and hit the little round bits that stick up you can fasten boards together‚Äù

But if you have no idea what a nail is and all the nails presented to you have already been hammered halfway, and you have no idea why you would want to fasten boards together and fastening boards is not presented as a step in some larger project, then sure you might understand the ‚Äúhow‚Äù part (whack the nailheads with the hammer), but the rest doesn‚Äôt make much sense.

If instead someone gives you a project where you have to make a complicated shape out of boards, you‚Äôll start hunting around for fastening methods. You might try tying gluing, tying them together with string, drilling little holes and putting pegs between the boards, etc. If they leave you to that for a few days (or weeks, or longer) and then afterward show you nails and a hammer, and demonstrate hammering in one nail, you will understand ‚Äúoh this is a heck of a lot easier and more effective than my half-assed method; the nails can be put in quickly, aren‚Äôt bulky and won‚Äôt fray like rope wrapped around, won‚Äôt break under moderate shear force like glue, they don‚Äôt need precise drilling or extra pegs, they are easy to remove with the back of the hammer, ...‚Äù The instructor won‚Äôt need to belabor the explanation, because the purpose and method of hammering nails will be obvious.",1541030734

"avorion","t5_2xcjs","The frequency and scale of Xsotan attacks rapidly escalated along the allied borders closest to the galactic core. 

Three T5a cruisers operating in independent sectors were assaulted and overwhelmed by Xsotan battle fleets, resulting in orders to abandon ship in all three conflicts.

Two of the four remaining T5a vessels in operation, the Cambridge and the San Antonio, were dispatched to repel the Xsotan and oversee salvage and recovery operations. The Xsotan suffered heavy losses, but the allied ships were insufficient to break the Xsotan line.

Both vessels expended their total compliment of fusion and nuclear torpedoes, totaling in 64 confirmed strikes and the elimination of 6 hostile targets. The tide of battle turned when the enemy entered close weapons range. The Xsotan attacked with a combination of energy discharge weapons and penetrating rail guns that rapidly depleted our force's defensive shields and caused critical system damage.

When it became obvious that neither ship could sustain the encounter, the order was made to retreat. While turning to flee, the Cambridge was struck by a high velocity rail gun bolt that passed diagonally through her secondary hull. Based on point of entry, it is believed that this strike ruptured several auxiliary generators. The energy of the explosion from each system followed the path of the projectile, causing far more damage than if each system were struck and destroyed separately.

The Cambridge did not survive and the status of her crew is unknown. The San Antonio managed to escape to a friendly sector and is currently undergoing repairs.

To ensure continued safe operations and expansion of the allied fleet, construction of all T5a heavy cruisers are to stop immediately. All forward construction docks are to convert their current heavy cruiser projects to the new T5b construction specification.",1541030735

Maybe see some lights start flickering when the powerplant can't keep up anymore, or maybe some sounds/visuals that show the ship is struggling to stay in it's quantum bubble before dropping out.

"HelloInternet","t5_2z1tz","There let's talk history because States do have some amount sovereignty. Similar to the level of Scottland, Wales and Northern Ireland. When the country was founded the word ""State"" meant Country and they acted as such each had their own foreign policy and trade practices. They even fought their own wars and had their own militia. It's my belief that this cultural identity holds over for some of the Americans. Which may mean this is generational 

I was talking about country vs state identity with friends when I was in college last year. Younger Americans will tend to say they are American versus their state. 

One other reason may be because a lot of well traveled Americans travel to South American countries which don't like Americans calling themselves Americans or the Country America and they may build that habit in Latin America when they travel to Europe.

Lastly a critique for OPs post, there are plenty of points of reference you could check if you were really interested look at a map and learn. I love maps and Geography and consider myself pretty familiar other places around the world. Also take a second to learn the US history and why Americans might answer one way versus another instead of assuming Arrogance. 

Lastly Scottland and Other states are more similar historically, culturally, and policy then you might think. ",1541030741

Now everybody wants to come in, and they come in illegally, and they use children. In many cases, the children aren‚Äôt theirs. They grab them, and they want to come in with the children.‚Äù

The president later added: ‚ÄúYou have really bad people coming in and using people. They‚Äôre not their children. They don‚Äôt even know the children. They haven‚Äôt known the children for 20 minutes. And they grab children and they use them to come into our country.‚Äù

In August the country¬†saw a 38 percent increase¬†in the number of migrants arrested and charged with illegally crossing the border, Department of Homeland Security officials said.

The Post first reported Friday that the White House was actively considering plans to again separate parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border. Senior administration officials noted, however, that they are not planning to revive the chaotic forced separations carried out by the Trump administration in May and June that spawned an enormous political backlash and led to a court order to reunite families.

One option under consideration, according to the report, is for the government to detain asylum-seeking families together for up to 20 days, then give parents a choice: Stay in family detention with their child for months or years as their immigration case proceeds, or allow children to be taken to a government shelter so other relatives or guardians can seek custody.

In an interview with ABC news that aired last week, first lady Melania Trump said she was ‚Äúblindsided‚Äù when she saw on the news that the administration was separating families at the border under its zero-tolerance policy. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that that policy will come out. and I said to [the president] that I feel that‚Äôs unacceptable. And he felt the same.‚Äù Her concern for the families, she said, led her to make trips to the U.S.-Mexico border in June.

Asked in the interview what she would say to the children who have been separated from their families, she said: ‚ÄúI would tell them to keep strong and that ‚Äî time will come. It ‚Äî everything needs to go through the court system.‚Äù

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","&gt; ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Maybe Jaime's inability to break away from his devotion Cersei is more realistic -- she's like his drug, and addiction is hard to kick -- but it's still hugely disappointing to me. He made so much progress in S4 on his journeys with Brienne. Then, this. (And more to come.) Sigh...

This is one area where the show diverged a lot from the books, where Jaime has completely abandoned Cersei at this point. She was begging him to come back for her trial and he wouldn‚Äôt go. And so later...
&gt; ‚Ä¢	‚Å†In spite of his threats to Edmure, we don't think Jaime would really kill a baby though, right? (Pushing Bran out the window doesn't count, but it's uncomfortably close.)

When this happens in the books, Jaime straight up thinks to himself that he would absolutely not really do this, but he knows Edmure will think he would. He relies on his reputation as the Kinglsayer, man without honor, to solve this conflict peacefully. (Note: I am pretty sure this happens towards the end of AFFC and we haven‚Äôt actually seen how it plays out yet?) Anyway, Jaime‚Äôs character progression makes a lot more sense in the context that he is free from Cersei at that point. So in the show, it‚Äôs really different to see him growing in spite of the fact that he is still in love with Cersei. Like, when he tells Edmure in the show that all he cares about is getting back to the woman he loves, it kind of takes away something for me. Jaime‚Äôs independence from Cersei is such a big deal in the books, I guess it‚Äôs just a little difficult for me to follow show-Jaime‚Äôs motivations here.",1541030743

Uggghhh yeah my gf used to make snarky comments about her ex all the time (pretty much from the start) what drove me most mad was when she was like ‚Äúmaybe I should just cut her out‚Äù but never did...in retrospect I just wanted to yell ‚Äúoh my god! Make up your fucking mind do you like this bitch or not??‚Äù  

I honestly think it was just her not having processes conflicting feelings and also the friendship being one of those things that keeps going because it does and you either haven‚Äôt realised or figured out how to cut Somone out 

Anyway I think she‚Äôs finally over it, doesn‚Äôt speak to her anymore which is good cause she was just source of drama anyway 

In you‚Äôre case it‚Äôs a tough one because I do believe some people have perfectly healthy freindships with their exes, the issue is though parters are all going to feel differently about it (valid reasons or not) and sometimes despite how much you show that the freindship isn‚Äôt a threat some just aren‚Äôt going to have it 

The closest thing to advice is be patient and show that the freindship is innocuous, which might take a little time....maybe occasionally do things with all three of you, which might sound weird I dont know but if the freind is a known entity then they might seem less threatening (but you don‚Äôt have to all be buds obviously) 

As I said some people despite all that aren‚Äôt gonna like...mabye then figure out your priorities and perhaps find Somone who‚Äôs more chill about it ",1541030747

While research *is* difficult, costly and unpredictable even in the best case scenario, we aren't even there yet. There's a well known ""valley of death"" between academic research such as the kind we're discussing and any commercial product that can be shipped to a paying customer. The modern incentive structure is largely not set up to bridge this gap, which is why you have this bifurcation between academic R&amp;D making splashy headlines with tentative claims while big industrial R&amp;D plods tweaking discoveries that were made 10+ years ago.

Many academic scientists are incentivized not to pursue commercialization but rather to publish the next ""new hot thing."" Some institutions are trying to change this in little ways, but it's still largely a ""publish or perish"" environment.

The goal of urban development in the 21st century is to make a city more walkable, bikeable and accessible through public transportation and not more driveable, which most cities in the world tried to do over the last half century, sprawled and failed.

A straight access to the waterway is one of the best ways to beautify a city and improve land values, and exploit one of Mumbai's best assets - it's sea face. A multi-lane access controlled highway on the actual shore severs a city from it's waterfront. Now that could potentially be alleviated with great connectivity every mile or so on a redeveloped waterfront, with bike lanes etc but I'm not sure how that would actually be implemented based on these pics, if at all. 

Thirdly, if you build more roads, in 2-3 years, you'll just have more traffic, because that incentivizes every citizen to move farther into the suburbs, buy a car and commute. Maintenance of existing roads, upgradation of all roads to concrete and monsoon proofing with drains, and keeping them pliable through the worst of the monsoons should really be Mumbai's roadway priority. What's the purpose of a superfast highway that then connects to a street that's bound to become waterlogged for a quarter or a third of the year?

Plug the rest into public transport, walking-friendly and bike-friendly initiatives, which the majority of citizens can use much more efficiently and effectively. Intra-city highway infrastructure all across the world is in decline, and while you certainly need them, a bare minimum (but well maintained) for freight and logistics and intercity (not intra) are the need of the hour, and certainly not for everyday commuting.

"WoT","t5_2rdg1","I became a fan of Sanderson after finishing WOT and I‚Äôve kept up with all his series. I think he did a really great job finishing the series and have very few complaints. 

I agree Sanderson‚Äôs Mat has some funny comments in his banter but Jordan seemed to make the humor surrounding Mat much more subtle. It would be in the contrast of his internal monologue vs his actions. In The Gathering Storm, Mat has a flippant wit that is almost shoved down your throat. He seems to be more of the Mat that we heard about growing up in the Two Rivers and not the man he has become. 

Main examples to me are his ‚Äúdisguises‚Äù for various members of The Band outside of Trustair and giving Joline Maza food that turns her mouth blue. Just seems like he is trying to hard to be funny without much depth.

So the idea of crazy specs, super thin and light design, etc, are pretty misguided - all they do is make something that needs to be pretty basic more expensive.  That's why those $50-150 Amazon tablets sell so well - that's the price point people want for watching a movie in bed or catching up with some YouTube while in the bathroom.  I got one of those 10 inch Fire tablets, took 5 minutes to install the Google Launcher plus the Play Store and Chrome, and it's perfect for all my TV/Movie consumption.  Could it be thinner, lighter, more powerful, etc?  Sure...but I'm not really interested in paying much more for it, and certainly not the $329+ for an iPad (and at that price, it's a mini, with a smaller screen than my Fire).

"ModelUSGov","t5_33mfm","&gt;This bill creates quite a lot of income tax brackets, some of them at extremely high cutoff ranges, which makes me question how much revenue it would raise. Could we see some calculations?

The revenue range is a slightly modified version of the current tax bracket system. Due to the 0% tax on the first bracket, I see this bill as cutting revenue. **Even though the bill cuts revenue in the short term, it will create economic stimulus by increasing the demand for goods in the economy.** The people this tax cut targets are the largest consumers of the economy, and this bill gives them the tools to increase their consumerism. 

&gt;Not buying back stock essentially consigns that capital to either not being invested or being invested badly, so if you want your corporate tax cuts to have the desired effects, you need buybacks. On net, they don't even make investors richer, you're just substituting stock for its cash value, which is a wash from the investor's perspective, but means that capital can be invested in another firm that promises bigger returns. Ironically enough, prohibiting or creating incentives against stock buybacks would have precisely the effects critics of the practice claim the buybacks have in the first place.

I am not completely opposed to stock buybacks, hence the reason why I did not ban it. However, I believe that stock buy backs should be bought in a less aggressive manner to encourage companies to invest in growth through actually expanding their business. Businesses often buy up their stock at often times high prices, making the buyback a bad use of capital. Every dollar used to buy back their own stock is money spent that isn‚Äôt acquiring competitors, expanding marketing, or creating new jobs. ",1541030754

It's good for rotations but it almost makes launch pads and the storm itself obsolete, only thing storm is doing now is pushing players into smaller circles, pretty hard to take any damage and/or die from it. Not saying storm should be the MVP but still, seems very silly. Also, the skill it takes to build good structures so people don't shoot you down easily just went down the drain, since there's no fall damage anymore (not to mention one rocket exploding the hardest ramp push you can do, which takes skill, and clicking m1 with a rocket equipped doesn't).

Lincoln gets remembered as a hero even though he was on record multiple times as saying he would do *literally anything* to preserve the Union.

Buchanan's fellatio of the South was exactly that, but he took the one-two punch of 1) the most radical-appeasement statements and (in)actions finally not being enough to keep things together for a few more years, and 2) the obvious historical hindsight of us accepting that slavery was completely fucking vile.

On #2, it's important to understand that even people who thought slavery was vile back in the 19th century U.S. were *still* mostly incredibly racist, and based very few of their objections upon the fundamental worth or dignity of the black individual.

Since 1980, there have been ~7000 women per year getting cs degrees. But what happened is that the baseline level of men in the field went from 10,000 in 1980 to &gt;30000.

The final two **Long Price Quartet** books were wonderful and heartbreaking in the best way possible. These books deserve more attention. And **Bloody Rose** had everything I loved about *Kings of the Wyld*, but with tons of depth to make it one of the best books I've read in a while.

On the other hand, while I've always liked Walter Moers, **The Labyrinth of Dreaming Books** felt like a miss. It basically felt like a retread of *The City of Dreaming Books*, which it more or less explicitly was. Still going to read the rest, but this was a chore to get through.

**Queen of Crows** by Myke Cole was a disappointment as well. It took the basic premise of *The Armored Saint* - that the evil corrupt Templars aren't necessarily wrong to kill people who use magic - and tossed that out the window, as well as going very cliche and throwing in a deus ex machina or two. I still like Heloise, so I'll still read the next one here too, but my expectations aren't high.

I appreciate the insight into the traditional IRA as my inaccurate understanding was that all the benefits were closed off to us, but your comment and some additional reading indicate that we can actually use it to our benefit. 

I appreciate the breakdown of how to best fund the accounts - this is exactly what I needed. After speaking with my wife at work about our conversation, we came up with the same course of action. Matching -&gt; 457 for flexibiility --&gt; IRA --&gt; so on.. 

I am planning on switching all of my accounts over to the 3-fund portfolio and VTSMX is one I will be using for my Roth. My 403b is through TIAA and the options are not great, so I may break down and incur the extra ER to use a target fund.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","On the topic of the morality of abortion, I've never seen a pro-lifer acknowledge that those policies will increase the number of dead women per year. That's just what happens when more women give birth. Allowing abortion in the case of life-threatening complications for the mother -- that's a cop out. *Women die anyway, because this only covers predictable health risks, not spontaneous ones*. The only moral way is to allow women to choose to take on this risk -- if they want a baby still, that's fine. But if they don't want to risk their health and all of the things that can harm them during birth -- then you allow them the choice to abort beforehand. Otherwise, women will die that never even wanted to give birth in the first place, and that's so terribly wrong I can't properly put it into words.

Babies dying is sad to them. But women dying who would have otherwise chosen to abort if given the chance? I never see this acknowledged, probably because adult women don't have the cute, innocent appeal that babies do, so it matters less if they die -- and again. It is an irrefutable fact that more women will die every year, specifically those who would have otherwise lived because they didn't want to give birth in the first place, if women are no longer allowed to choose.",1541030767

"esist","t5_3irqb","I know that for a fact now. It is like The Beadle's opinion on juries during inquests over deaths at the workhouse. Polls like inquests are only effective as the educational level of the pollster and the polled. 
Then there are the holdouts. The hold outs have ""no opinion"" on the question or the person. This is one limitation of polls: the hold outs that say they cannot decide or have ""no opinion"" or just slams the door on the pollster. 

What does a person know and when, how or what do they know about it? I learned in Political Science or Civics classes in college and high school that learning has a significant effect on anything a person knows or believes. What they know is a significant predictor of how well they can select someone to hold a political office or if some issue goes up or down or if that school is built or the ground lay fallow until next year the bond issue is voted on again!
There is no shock to me that a Trumpster is less educated than a Anti-Trumper and will tell a pollster so. The question is how many of them are out there that will not tell any of them?
Those that do polls know that or should know what to do if a query refuses to tell them if they are for or against Trump. If they have an opinion, they will be honest. So if they do not, they will tell them know so or not or lie about their opinions if one can guess the latter was a secret Trump supporter. 
People are more likely support things that do not make much sense because they are scared. They are scared in 2016 when they pulled the lever for Trump instead of anyone else. What made them scared? Trump made them scared because they ""know nothing"" about what Trump says to them when he tells them it was the Mexicans or Hillary making them scared for instance. When in fact it was the quarter-century of the GOP and their unwillingness to compromise that cause them to be scared in the first place. Their lack of education about what is going on in the world or in their own backyard makes them tend to vote Republican.
It is up to them to find some courage to learn about what they are up against. A Trump Supporter will maybe never flip unless Trump does something very bad to them, like a stiff tariff against a farmer or a tax-cut forcing a budget cut against their welfare or their pension or any other bad or lousy thing. Even these three wimps who support Trump and showed their cowardly devotion toward Trump can flip many of them.
Past headlines since mid-October are not working in Trump's favor. All the caravans in the world will not help Trump now. He knows he is toast. The more he tweets and rallies his base up to Tuesday, the more voters will slip through his fingers.",1541030767

"bravia","t5_3bqx2","No, you really can't/shouldn't use old 1.4 cables for 4k, at least If you want more than 30hz.
1.4 can maximum 4k with 24, 25 and 30 hz. - with 10.2 Gbps while hdmi 2.0 compatible cables have 18Gbps.
It's no marketing trick or hype, it's a must have.

You will get lags and issues if you send 18 through a old 10.2 hardware. (e: There is no guarantee that your 1.4 compatible cable can reach a speed of 18G since they had 10.2G as a target - there are cables mit 11, 15 17, 18 - while newer cables can even reach 48 and above - not said that you need such a speed atm, same as in the past. Normally you can find in the description a point like this: ""Allows resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 pixels @ 30 Hz (Ultra HD)"")

To quote from your link:
""This means: When you buy an HDMI High Speed Cable today you can be sure that it supports 4k and tomorrow‚Äôs high bandwidth requirements of HDMI 2.0.""
That's because todays cables are these special cables and No more 1.4.compatible, they are 2.0 compatible. (Sure, they are still backwards compatible, but i think you know what i mean)

And because He knows that it's not the full truth He says at the end:
""HDMI cable 1.4: 4K support very likely, but not guaranteed""
That's because its usage is very limited, as mentoined above. (Hz)
(e: Even the website-comments are discuss about the fact that it's a missleading article because it's not the full truth - Yes, you can watch your 4k movies without issues because they are between 24 and 30 fps, but you can't do stuff with more hz/fps without issues)

I think everyone who had problems and has changed to the correct cable can tell you that it's really important. (e: You can get compatible cables for 4-12‚Ç¨ depending on the length.)

It's also not the case that's it's officially called 1.4 cable, 2.0 cable etc but they need to be compatible for that bandwidth and older cables, lets say up to 1.4 cables, arent compatible - but sure, they still show you a picture. But you can't get the whole shit through the pipe if the pipe is to small, so it just needs time until something awful happens If there is too much incoming content for that cable. (And HDR even makes it more worse because there is more data in an short time)

There are a lot myths about hdmi like the usage of gold adapters etc, but the correct bandwidth is real and important and it's not reached by default with all ""1.4-optimized cables"" from the past. todays cables are a different thing.",1541030768

They need secure hardware to offload the FileVault key to if they really want the drive to be resistant to a hardware attack.  They're already there on phones and tablets and it's been pretty predictable that they'll head there at least on laptops.  If they enforce FileVault on all installs and insist on keeping the keys in the secure enclave then we're locked out unless somebody can emulate it (which might not be impossible), but I wouldn't be predicting it tomorrow.

It sounded so strange and unusual compared to everything else available at the time. I actually did rent it when it was fairly new and even though I instantly disliked it, I still thought it was neat as it was quite unorthodox and novel in several ways. This game came about during a time when NES games still felt very much like toys in some ways, and not really taken too seriously (or even much understood) by the companies that released them domestically (see: every Konami instruction manual from the period). A popular game would have a lot of word of mouth, often, and the more eccentric things going on under the hood would be discussed amongst people in school or whatever (all the hidden elements of Simon's Quest or Zelda 2, for example). But for a game like this, which no one seemed to pick up other than as a curious rental (if that), it never got explored enough by too many folks and therefore I'd guess that didn't help it's chances for being more talked about/secrets being shared.",1541030769

In fact, the mayor of London famously renounced his US citizenship as he had dual citizenship from happening to have been born there but never lived there and then publicly explained how he was suddenly charged with taxes.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Clearly, I was shitposting, and of course there's been a surge in offense since the 2002 rule changes, no one can deny that, so that's not some illuminating argument. 

However, I completely reject your original premise and what that graph represents in relation to it, i.e., ""[the ruination] of [football].""

And since you didn't really explain that at all, and that's a pretty big point you're making that I have no way of fully understanding, I'll just say this:

I like offense. It's fun to watch. Sure, I fucking love the big hits, the big sacks, and people getting separated from the ball, but if I have to sacrifice that so that these people can walk and have a functioning brain into their 50s, I'm fine with it. Worth it. Especially because it adds to the fun of the offense. 

And honestly, I think they need to go a bit further in the rule changes to protect defensive players, as well as offensive players. 

Football is always gonna be a blood sport, sure, but that doesn't mean people should sacrifice their mental and physical longevity to play it - to a certain extent, as I said with former players in their 50s (and 40s, for that matter). Getting hit is always gonna take a toll. And they're compensated well for the pain they endure. But just one Junior Seau putting a shotgun to his chest and taking his own life, due to the compilation of brain injuries he suffered on the field is too much for me. 

My entertainment is not worth a single human life, let alone hundreds - both literally and figuratively. And neither is yours. 

But I think the dude who replied earlier than me got it right, and in a much more succinct way. To reiterate:

&gt;You're just mad because your team sucks at it.

"miamidolphins","t5_2s20n","I had season tickets since 2006 (unfortunately had to stop this year), so I‚Äôve seen every game every season since then at a minimum.  Ryan Tannehill is without a doubt the second best QB we‚Äôve had behind Chad Pennington but as you know, that isn‚Äôt saying much.  Your definitely biased if you think Dalton, Joe Flacco, Alex Smith, and Jimmy G are worse QBs.  All of those guys have accomplished much more in their careers and simply played better.  Even then, would you really commit to any of those guys.  Tannehill is in the ‚Äúslightly below average‚Äù QB class and we shouldn‚Äôt be committing to them long term.  We can still keep him around until we find someone else, but he‚Äôs not the long term answer and it‚Äôs time to draft someone new.  I think we should wait it out a year and select Tua from ‚ÄòBama cuz he‚Äôs better than anyone from this years class.  He‚Äôs in Luck and Wilson‚Äôs class.  Both of those guys are elite QBs now and the other guys from the class have long since been benched or are out of the league.  Tannehill just hasn‚Äôt shown enough and there‚Äôs no more potential for him, he‚Äôs 30.  He has negative pocket awareness, keeps getting injured, struggles with the deep ball, and just isn‚Äôt that good overall.  

Tannehill is still going to get a starting job because he‚Äôs slightly below average and that got Case Keenum $18 mil last year.  I‚Äôd rather see Denver or New York struggle to go 8-8 with him than see us do that.  I personally want him to go the Jaguars because the rest of that team is super bowl caliber and Bortles is that bad.  Tannehill could go far with a roster like that, but given that our team has so many holes to fill, we can‚Äôt support Tannehill like that.  

I‚Äôm sure if you ask a Cowboys fan, a Titans fan, or a Raiders they‚Äôd 100% tell you their QBs are better than Tannehill.  

P.S.  There‚Äôs no need to hate on this year‚Äôs rookie QB class.  All of those rookies are in dreadful situations and have shown a lot of promise.  They each have flaws to their game, but they‚Äôve played pretty well for rookie QBs.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I understand your point, however your employer sponsored healthcare is a part of your pay. It's compensation you get in return for your time spent working. 

Any and all compensation, whether an actual pay raise, healthcare, pension, annuity etc or all part of a wage package. It's not just your gross wages, its everything you get for your time spent working. 

Being union, we vote on our contract. Say it's for 5 years, every year there's a 2 dollar raise. Every year the members vote on how to spend that 2 dollars. Add .50 to health insurance, add .50 to the check, and a dollar split between annuity and pension.  
 
So, if we make say 40 bucks an hour,  that's just on the check. Our actual wage package is say 80. We are compensated 80 dollars an hour, but only 40 of it we actually see on the paycheck. Doesn't mean the other 40 bucks isnt part of our wage.

That's how it works, if the health plan is going to cost more, that's actually a raise to your compensation. If you want more of a voice in deciding how your wages are set, I'd suggest unionizing.

Or it could just be that the insurer already has lot of customers in that area and now you're being loaded to carry the additional risk.

This will boost the rust issues. 

Ideal one is taking it off the car, prepping it somewhat decent and apply undercoat/paint afterwards. But it seems you don't really care about the car for long term. Wire wheel the rust as far as you can reach and apply black paint. That's good enough i guess.

"UlcerativeColitis","t5_2tb9x","I was put on Imuran for about 3 years after Pentasa stopped working. I remember that Imuran + prednisone took longer for remission to kick in than any other drug I took, but I did eventually start feeling better. 

The next time I flared, I switched doctors, and he recommended switching meds because he was worried about adverse side affects. I went on apriso almost 2 years ago and have been in remission ever since. 

I never really had any problems with Imuran, but blood tests every 3 months were a pain, I can't even imagine every week. :(

It kept me in remission about as long as every other drug I've tried, but my new doctor was pretty surprised I was ever even put on it. He took it as a ""last resort"" -type drug and was in the process of switching all of his patients off of it.  

I'm a pretty chill person, but I had terrible mood swings while on predisone. I don't think I was especially angry while on Imuran though, but that initial diagnosis is a dark time. 

I hope you start feeling better! I'm so sorry this happened to you.

In contrast Quine wrote about the indeterminacy of translation between two languages; the obvious implication being that such indeterminacy pervades all linguistic activity (even within the same language).

They're both precursors of certain postmodern ideas, I suppose, in the sense that they pulled the focus of philosophical inquiry towards language. But I don't think either of them would think Derrida's postmodernism is a proper extension of their own work.",1541030777

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","This is what the Steelers are gonna do. Steelers will non exclusive franchise tag bell. With the non exclusive franchise tag, bell can still work deals with other teams, but the Steelers have the right to first refusal. Here is the kicker though. With the non exclusive franchise tag, if another team offers bell a contract, and bell accepts the contract, and Steelers do NOT match the offer, that team that wants bell now owes Pittsburgh a 1st AND a 3rd round pick (due to it being the third tag; if you want sources I can provide in the comments just ask; just a lot to type). Bell is basically screwed in this situation and here is why. Steelers will come out ahead on all of this:

Let‚Äôs say the colts want bell: not only do the colts have to find a contract that works for their team AND for bell, they also have to offer a contract that a) are sure the Steelers won‚Äôt match and b) isn‚Äôt too high that the Steelers DONT match and then have to give up a 1st AND a third rounder to the Steelers for bell. Any team that want bell also has to be willing to give up 2 draft picks...and pay out the ass for bell.

Why would any team offer bell a huge contract AND be willing to give the Steelers a first AND a third round pick? It won‚Äôt happen! The CBA is so fucked up. I‚Äôm a Steelers fan and this will benefit my team, but it‚Äôs still super fucked up.

After that date, **the player may sign only a one-year Player Contract with his Prior Club for that season, and such Player Contract may not be extended until after the Club‚Äôs last regular season game of that League Year.** 

It does not say that you can only sign the franchise tag.

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt; Things that are regarded as feminine aren't celebrated like masculinity

Masculinity is hardly celebrated anymore. It's called toxic, by feminists, many feminine things have huge industries around them, from fashion to make-up to even sanitary products which have awareness and empowerment campaigns all the time. Off-hand I can't think of anything that has celebrated masculinity to the degree femininity is celebrated.  One could argue sport celebrates masculinity but while it may celebrate masculine traits like competitiveness it doesnt fixate on masculinity itself like all the girl power and empowerment stuff does for women. There's been loads of adverts and campaigns that explicitly say *""women are awesome""* but I haven't seen such a thing saying *""men are awesome""* in a long time",1541030781

"Petioles","t5_2vrr5","That's rough. I know that feel too well, though. Smoking daily and feeling like I really need to take a break, then tell myself that ""today I won't smoke"" and then later on that day I just find myself craving it and finding reasons to smoke. I guess it's really all in how much you wanna commit to it. During the times I really wanted to stop smoking, I just stopped. During the times I don't really want to stop smoking yet tell myself I *should*, I didn't. Some breaks were due to running out of weed and telling myself I shouldn't pick up (easy to just buy in California) as I feel a tolerance building up. Others were due to just getting so dependent on it that I've noticed I couldn't eat at all without it. It was getting quite annoying and to get a ""normal"" appetite while high wasn't as fun as getting the munchies while high. So I knew I had to stop as the effects were not as much as getting me high but getting me to feel ""normal"" because that's what I'm used to.

So really though, it's in how bad you want to stop more than you want to pick it up and smoke. Make it through the first few days and you'll probably be able to push through it. The worst of the withdrawals don't seem to come up until later on but once you're through it all you'll be glad you've stuck it through. I'd recommend you some CBD if you're looking to get some sort of relief during a break. It won't get you high but it seems to help me sleep and not feel totally nauseous.",1541030781

"RoleReversal","t5_359dt","(This got a lot bigger than I was expecting)  
  
As a bisexual, I am convinced that role-reversal is more than just a kink or purely sexual thing. I know from previous experience what it's like to question oneself and wonder whether what I'm craving is a want or a need.  
  
When I discovered I thought muscles were hot, my reaction was ""oh neat, that's sexy"". But when I discovered I was bi, I was like ""oh thank *fuck* it's not just me!"" before breaking down and crying.
  
For me, and I think many others too, discovering role reversal wasn't merely a case of ""oh that's neat and sexy"", as one feels when you discover a new kink. Instead, it was a deep, aching relief to discover that I'm not alone in these emotions.  
  
That deep, aching relief is what it feels like to discover you're bi, or gay, or trans, and it's what I felt when I discovered role reversal too.  
  
[This video is a good description of the various forms sexuality can take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXAoG8vAyzI)  
  
I think that final section, ""gender role"", is what role-reversal is. It's important to note that while ""masculine"" and ""feminine"", and all the stereotypes associated with those words, are what society has decided are the ""normal"" gender roles, I think there is an infinite variety of gender roles to take.  
  
""Role Reversal"", I think, is just when your own combination of preferred gender roles just so happen to align closer with the opposite of what is associated with your gender.  
  
So for instance, in our modern world, we have fairly loose gender roles compared to the 50's. This means that a man can wear his hair long if he likes, but still can't be shy, and women can have well-paid jobs, but can't ask guys out.  
It's these points, where one's own role deviate enough from the ""gender norm"", that role reversal comes from - but there is a great spectrum in which roles you personally lean towards.",1541030782

"wine","t5_2qhs8","&gt; and no singular person or collective ever will again. End of an era.

This is true - and it's because he changed things. In the late 70's, there were no reliable independent wine reviews available to the general public; there were only more or less industry-affiliated (and dependent) reviewers. Who basically never drank (or never reviewed, anyway) a wine they didn't like. Because they were really an extension of wine's marketing, and not really there for consumers. 

They were the equivalent of local newspaper car reviewers, who depended on loaned cars from local dealerships to have something to review, so all of the reviews were positive. And the newspaper only had a car column in the first place because those same dealers spent huge amounts of money on advertising in the paper; a review was simply a less obvious ad.

Parker, on the other hand, was *actually* independent - the WA was a subscription-only newsletter, and his real job as a lawyer paid the bills...at least until WA blew up. 

Parker was not afraid to make judgments on wine; and if nothing else he was very consistent, so if you liked the style of wine he liked (and many people did), you could rely on his reviews to help you find other wines you would like. 

Complaints about ""Parkerization"", and Parker's outsize influence, etc., are not *wrong* - but they have to be seen in context, and in context, Parker was so influential because many people: (1) knew him as the only honest wine critic; and (2) could rely on the consistency of his reviews. 

Things are different now; Parker showed that there was a market for independent wine reviews, while the internet has made independent wine reviews much easier to publish.

&gt; **Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution**
&gt; 
&gt; Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.


-

&gt; **Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution**
&gt; 
&gt; Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.

&gt; Eligibility to vote in the United States is established both through the federal constitution and by state law. Several constitutional amendments (the 15th, 19th, and 26th specifically) 

-

&gt; **The US Constitution stated in Amendment XV, which was ratified by the states in 1870:**
&gt; 
&gt; ""Section 1. **The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged** by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. 

-

&gt; **The US Constitution stated in Amendment XVII, which was ratified by the states in 1913:**
&gt; 
&gt; ""The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, **elected by the people thereof**, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.""

-

&gt; **The US Constitution (1789) stated in Article I, Section II, Clause I:**
&gt; The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year **by the People of the several States**,

I honestly believe this is the best setup without investing too much. Once you have those heroes, get Annette asap, either through the inn or a ticket. It'll take time to build her up (needs t5, UT + UW), but once you get those she will pay for herself very quickly in pretty much all content. You can also start investing into an NPC- I suggest May, as she will help you the most in the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: only get Mirianne if you have the Miri/Lewisia/Requina ticket. I have no idea if they still hand those out. If you don't have it then Artemia would probably a decent alternative from the beginner's tickets.

"GolfClash","t5_3ioqe","I do like Katanas, but they're the easiest to acquire for just a couple bucks via fail to qualify or qualify tournament offers.

The extra power on a Titan is more important than a sidespin, in my opinion. You also get a lot of Titans as tournament rewards, so it is possible that Katanas are actually more rare.

In my opinion though, a Titan is an acceptable ball into Tour 12, where a Katana might be a little lacking.

If you know you won't need much sidespin, then Nav's WR2 is better than Quasar's WR1, particularly in a headwind. It's minor, but they're the same price, and I use each of them roughly the same amount.

Yes, I call clubs blues/yellows/purples, because I don't believe the game ever uses the terms ""common"" or ""rare"", so color is the easiest to identify.

In my opinion speed opening chests is worth it if you know you're going to earn another chest with the slot you open. Compare 20 gems for a random chest to the prices of chests in the shop, the difference is comical.

How many trophies do you have? TH won't appear unless you have 2400+, which you'd have if you had maxed all tours 1-8.

Some players spend a lot of money, some players are very lucky, and some players are amazing and win expert tournaments, and get lucky and level up their Apoc quickly.

Do you play tournaments? The majority of your purple club cards can come from high-placing tournament chests.

You should read the club card guide I just posted earlier today, it has a lot of information about how to get club cards. But in general, just earn more chests and win in tournaments.

Not everyone is going to get to 4400 trophies. I just wouldn't worry about that for now, focus on 2400+ to get TH to show up in the shop.

Hitting Perfect 85% is a good start. You also want to get very familiar with the wind/ring method. If you can sink Short Iron shots &gt; 25% of the time, you're well on your way.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","It's a ""cop-out"" to say that I'd rather they focus on making the game better through *content* rather than endlessly tweaking things that will bring only minor amounts of enjoyment to a subset of the player base? And yes, individual weapon tuning *can* steal weeks of development time. Any feature can steal weeks of development time. They don't exist in a vacuum and you just flip a switch, they are connected to *systems*. If you don't understand what I'm talking about or you continue to ignore this fact, you don't have a lot of experience in software development. It's not a mystical, magical art, but things tend to break when you make changes and there's often no easy solution to even simple problems.

Besides that, your contention that we are the guinea pigs for untested content updates is ridiculous. They have play testers and run internal tests among dev teams all the time. Tweak a weapon's stats and they have to gather data on its performance before releasing it into the wild, if only to make sure no game-breaking bugs are in there. Just look at what happened with the Full Bore perk on shotguns vis-a-vis Cerberus+1. A simple and needed change to the perk may have turned an exotic weapon that (many people were extremely happy with in terms of tuning) into a dud. If any software company can ""learn"" to predict that other than to be prepared for the possibility, then they are either releasing bugs intentionally or they are literally the biggest idiots on the planet and, angst aside, I think we both know neither is the case with Bungie.

Player feedback is great, but my point is that players don't have all the data, so there are times when we don't really know what we want. At the very least, we don't always know whether the things we want will negatively impact the game in more significant ways. I'm not saying don't give feedback, I'm saying don't always expect feedback to be acted on in the way you think and don't expect any game dev to have a magic solution to a game's problems.

There's a difference between moving forward and ignoring the past, and, quite frankly, Forsaken would have sucked if Bungie was really doing the latter. Bungie has a lot of things to fix, for sure, but to sit there and say that they should be able to either predict how well a certain item will do or that they should drop everything to tune every single item on-the-fly is going way to the other extreme. The game has momentum, and I'm perfectly happy for Sweet Business to sit in my vault for a little while longer if it means Thunderlord is going to be awesome or that Black Armory is going to add a great new game mode that I can play for weeks. Hell, I'd have been okay with Malfeasance still being a disappointment; personally, I think there's still work to do on it, but I'm okay if they wait til they're ready to drop a catalyst on it to take it the rest of the way.",1541030793

Exactly like changing your attraction to someone based on any other aspect of them. Attraction is not logical.

&gt;it's also a transphobic thing that you do

No it's not, attraction does not have to be tied to phobia. 

&gt;finding out someone is 1/8th African and breaking up with them entirely on the basis of that is a racist thing to do.

Racism requires prejudice, some of these situations will involve prejudice, some will not.

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","Yes, if you're referring to the Honduran mob, or the illegal Mexicans trying to force themselves in and claim refugee status for themselves. Jesus would never favor letting in hundreds of millions of lawless  foreigners. Nor would he favor a globalist alliance like the UN to try to violate the sovereignty of a country and force them to take people in. 

If you think God is in favor of open borders, I strongly suggest you read more of your Bible. Jerusalem itself was completely protected by a wall.

Numbers 20:14-21

Moses asks the king of Edom for entrance into his land and is rejected twice. So the Israelites turned away. 

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+20%3A14-21&amp;version=ESV

The sovereignty of a nation's borders is emphasized all throughout scripture.

Acts 17:26

26¬†And¬†he made from one man every nation of mankind to live¬†on all the face of the earth,¬†having **determined** allotted periods and¬†**the boundaries of their dwelling place,**¬†27¬†that they should seek God,¬†and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him.


USA, and specifically Trump himself have full authority and sovereignty to decide who can enter.

Illegal immigration of any kind is an obvious no. Legal immigration is up to the President and the people to decide, whether we agree or not. ",1541030796

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","&gt;When was the US last war?

right now? That's what makes the US different: It can do (almost) all of the stuff people accuse the big bully countries of doing, except it does it in such a way that those same people are blind to it.

Sure, the president hasn't come on the TV and said ""we are at war with X"" for over a decade, but they've figured out other ways of making piles of bodies even so! They're involved in Syria, helping Saudi Arabia with its campaign in Yemen, etc, etc. Are you saying because those weren't formally declared as ""The USA vs Country X"" the USA can't be seen as *not* engaging in war? If so, that's absurd! They can do whatever they want as long as they say things like ""We are uhh gently massaging tensions in the Middle East with ballistic based coercion"" instead of ""We are at war""? For all the misplaced circlejerking about the book ""1984"" that goes on, this is when it's *actually* relevant. that's what Orwell was getting at! Countries can be at war and somehow you *think they're not*, just because of the language they use.

Even like the comment two above you said: ""China is expanding the borders of its empire (currently South China Sea.) America is not."" The USA found a better way of doing that that has better public relations implications. They don't *need* to forcefully expand their borders. They can just bend countries to their will with economic &amp; political pressure. It's much much more effective and even more opaque (to most people) than  China's brazen expansion (although China definitely does the same less obvious things as the USA, of course). They can do things like [fuck with the democracy of a country, destabilising it for almost a decade and counting](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-us-role-in-the-honduras-coup-and-subsequent-violence_us_5766c7ebe4b0092652d7a138) (there are oodles of examples of the USA doing this in the past century+, this is just one of the most recent ones), just because they didn't like the person who won fair and square  - and still get declared ""defenders of global freedom and democracy"" - just because they say that's what they are!",1541030796

"introvert","t5_2qlr2","I have seen that a lot of people here, being introverts, prefer friendships with other introverts and also would rather date other introverts. Personally, I prefer extroverts. I can tell you some advantages/disadvantages based on my personal experience, but, obviously, many other introverts would feel at least a little differently. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Introvert/Introvert--Advantages**

I tend to get more of the intellectual stimulation I like and feel that I ""need"" from other introverts. We have high-quality conversations on a regular basis, and we can relate to each other in terms of many of the same likes/dislikes and experiences related to being an introvert.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introvert/Introvert--Disadvantages**

A friendship or relationship is fairly unlikely to ever be initiated between us in the first place because so many introverts are also quiet and don't take the lead in social situations. This is particularly true in person. The introverts I've developed close relationships/friendships with I've met online, where it seems to be easier for a lot of us to express ourselves and initiate interactions. I also find it extremely hard to maintain relationships with other introverts since they don't seem to gain energy from social interaction if it's intellectually stimulating the way I do, and since they seem less likely to let you know when you've upset them. I am spectacular at upsetting people, and once you show me you're someone who can carry on great conversations I don't really need as much time away from you to ""recharge"" as I do with most people. I also am usually the one who has to act out of character, i.e. ""be the extrovert,"" in order for our social interactions to not be infrequent or never, and I hate this. I usually feel like introverts don't care about me in friendships/relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introvert/Extrovert--Advantages**

Extroverts bring a personality that complements mine, which I feel also means they bring strengths that I don't necessarily have and I bring strengths to them that they don't necessarily have. The best is when you meet an extrovert who kind of understands that you're just not going to like XYZ or not going to do XYZ, or can't do XYZ often, and they just accept it and don't push too much or make too many negative comments about it. Those types of extroverts do exist, and it's great when you have them in your life. They will also do a lot of the heavy lifting that I don't want to do when it comes to the relationship/friendship, such as initiating it, inviting me to do things, contacting me, etc, and they will make it fairly clear they do care about me/enjoy being with me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Introvert/Extrovert--Disadvantages**

If you get an extrovert who is not understanding or who is constantly going to try to force you to do stuff you don't want to do or who will put you down for being introverted, that's a huge problem. But even if you get one of the more understanding and accepting ones, it's probably going to irritate them sometimes that you two don't have the same type of social energy and/or social interests, and there's always going to be stuff about your introverted nature that they don't understand. Extroverts are also very quick to throw around words/phrases like ""fun"" and ""lighten up"" because you're the way you are as an introvert, i.e. they don't ""get"" that they generally have a totally different definition of what's ""fun"" than you do or that you can be really fun, funny, silly, loose, etc, when you're around the right people or have a fully charged battery. And their efforts to try to get to know you or make you feel comfortable are often the exact opposite of what you want someone to do.

I really don't recommend protein powder because it's easy to meet your daily demand without it.

It's a misconception that you have to chug down a protein shakes on top of eating slightly more than normal. Only the bigger guys need to do that(and even they could simply eat/drink more protein). Make sure you eat lots of fat, protein and some carbs and you'll probably won't even think about those shakes.

I have made tremendous progress the last two years and I only obsessed over my protein intake the first two months or so. It's really not necessary as long as you eat right.

&gt;Unfortunately, the key sentence is cryptic. Is that a list of three different categories (foreigners, aliens, and people from the families of ambassadors and ministers), in which case *all*¬†kids of foreigners and aliens would be excluded from birthright citizenship? Or is ‚Äúaliens‚Äù used simply as a synonym for ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù and meant to be read in apposition, in which case the exclusion is limited to the families of ambassadors and foreign ministers? (‚ÄúForeigners‚Äîthat is, aliens‚Äîwho belong to the families . . .‚Äù)

&amp;#x200B;

From the same source there was plenty of debate that argued it meant what it has been assumed to mean.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The proposition before us, I will say, Mr. President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law; now it is proposed to incorporate the same provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal civil rights with other citizens of the United States. . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;I have lived in the United States for now many a year, and really I have heard more about Gypsies within the last two or three months than I have heard before in my life. It cannot be because they have increased so much of late. It cannot be because they have been felt to be particularly oppressive in this or that locality. It must be that the Gypsy element is to be added to our political agitation, so that hereafter the Negro alone shall not claim our entire attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly, native americans and the children of ambassadors were meant to be excluded.  No one doubts or debates that.

2. Gab is a private company contracted to store goods in a private warehouse and advertised the location of its goods in a private phonebook.
3. To access Gab's goods you use your contract with a common carrier to request delivery from their warehouse using their name in the phonebook.
3. The warehouse and phonebook use the roads and common carrier delivery services... but they are not common carriers.
4. It was the warehouse and phonebook which ceased business with Gab.

The term carrier is super important.

Go Daddy does not carry anything. Hosting services do not carry anything. 

If I register a domain with Go Daddy, setup a server with Amazon, advertise with Google. None of these businesses actually do any of the delivery or movement of my goods. They store them to be delivered by the actual common carriers, which would be the various levels of ISPs.

"digimon","t5_2rxw7","&gt;I think it was just the average kid becomes a hero or champion aspect that was very appealing.

Ah, so you DO get the appeal of pokemon! 
See you kinda contract yourself. You say you like ""average"" people becoming heroes, but then you claim that it's better to be a destined one. That isn't aveage, that is being handpicked for greatness by no merit of your own.  Meanwhile, Ash Ketchum(by all rights kind of a loser) wanders around the world following his dream even when he's crushed furiously by competition. The face he keeps trying is the most important lesson you can learn in life: even if you are average, even if you outgunned, you never give up.

When I was a child my mother preferred Pokemon to Digimon, not because of conent, but because she thought Pokemon had deeper characters. Team Rocket, especially, she thought were good for children to watch as well as Ash. You don't give up, you keep trying, things in life will not be handed to you by something as superficial as destiny. 

&gt; realistic setting

This is always an issue I took with Digimon it...wasn't very realistic at all? It's hard scifi elements that just kind of sit around and honestly it's little better than Pokemon. YOu have one side trying to hide their ""partners"" if you will, while the other side embraces a life of support and co-existence. The Pokemon world is literally what Adventure was working to as an end, in that respect, and how it resolves in 02. 

&gt; It never really feels like ash has grown. and for 13 seasons, it doesn't seem like hes accomplished much at all either.

Actually? It's the opposite. The series has gone on for so long Ash's character wavers from kind of dense shonen protag(first series), experienced trainer(gens 3/4), total noobie with brain damage(gen 5), and suddenly back to being experienced(gen 6) and then back to being kind of a dense shonen protag. He goes places, but due to the by episode nature of the series very little of it actually sticks outside episodes that focus on that. 
His most important traits shine through, however, and I honestly do believe he's gotten more boring as time has went on because they try to characterize him too much. In the original series he was dense, if not well meaning, and showed that sometimes helping people is far better than ruining them in a colorful monster battle. He didn't get his badges through battling, a running gag, nor did he force capture his pokemon. He took the time to get to know them, their quirks, and was generally an ok guy and the gym leaders decided this far superseded something as trivial as powerlevels. 

The odd part is that Ash's track record is super solid outside the people angry he's never beaten the league. He usually ranks in the top 8, finals as of X/Y, beat the Battle Frontier which is far more hardcore than any league, and has regularly went out and saved the world by just being there at random. 

&gt;-pokemon vs digimon. Ones honestly just a pet. You get it, you feed it, pet it, train it, take it to the vet, maybe ill love you in return, but it just generally doesnt have a say in what yall do.

See I've always viewed this as the opposite: Digimon, at it's roots is a *pet raising simulator that pre-dates the anime* They will die if you don't feed them, evolve improperly if you don't clean their poop, it's a digital life you have full control over. Pokemon, meanwhile, are wild animals that will absolutely ruin you if you screw witht heir schedule. You have to go out and tame these creatures, something Digimon later adapted, they are not smiling friends. You have to earn their respect. 
Digimon exist dependent on a human just as much as pokemon do, and both can exist battle, eat, and live their own lives away from humans if they so choose. In fact, Pokemon existed as long as humans(unlike Digimon, who are byproducts of human creations) and god is probably a normal type. What do they both have in common? They're better with humans, because both have a give and take relationship. You can view differently, but ultimately this is one of the few factual ways I can call you wrong. It's a running concept in monster taming show: Pokemon, Digimon, Medabots, Monster Rancher, while the bond is explored differently they all cover the same ground. 

 &gt;theres a lot of violence..not just against the monster but against the human as well. Death has come up a few times. Lots of conflicts between the main characters, depression, being adopted or having divorced parents, wishing they werent a part of this...that's why i said pokemons just a game they get to choose to be a part of, digimon, they didn't have a say.

I, personally, find the pokemon world far more violent than the Digimon by leaps and bounds. Misty was emotionally abused by her sisters, Ash was raised by a single mother, his best friend became a gigantic douchebag, there are killbeasts human could never hope to match running around, psychics that can steal your soul/turn you into a doll, and even oneshot characters cover those very same issues. Off hand I remember randoms being forced into things by their family,  humans attacked by Pokemon in a lethal capacity, abuse of a pokemon that is little better than a child, etc...

Things are there, they're just not shoved in your face. Pokemon covers similar issues, but in a far more mundane setting. In this case I can buy it a little more than Digimon because character growth is a necessity in Digimon due to the nature of it's writing. However, Pokemon series have people handle issues in a more ideal setting. They help each other, they have doubts, and at the end of day are just trying to be a better person than they woke up as. This is, at times, far more human. 

&gt;The saving the world theme may have been overdone quite a bit in anime culture...but thats still a bigger accomplisment than being the best pokemon trainer imo. Especially whem ash hasnt accomplished that either

This is atually my issue with Pokemon. I wan't a friendly, fun, story that doesn't revolve around savign the world but because the games have taken shifts to self insert fanfiction EVERY. SINGLE. SEASON, and a movie or two, Ash has to go out and save the world despite not even being the best trainer in the region. 

&gt;Theres probably a very small minority of pokemon fans who has watched every single episode and movie...whats the initiative? It really feels like a loophole with just new pokemon, trainers and team enemies thrown in. 

This is my problem with Digimon. You have the same characters, with different faces, with new mons(that are basically the same as the mons last season, with vaguely different evolution trees) that go through similar plots with cartoonishly evil antagonists. Honetly I love Adventure, it's my favorite, but it was a painfully by the book anime at some parts. It took Savers to give us a human that was actually, factually, somebody you could call a true villain and into Xros to change up the formula enough to even fell new(which did, in fact, carry over into appmon).  I'm not even saying Pokemon is better than Digimon int his capacity, but at least Pokemon is honest about it. 

Digimon doesn't leave much up tot he imagination that you need to analyze, especially because as of Tamers/Savers they have somebody explain every single little plot point and whyt his is horrible rather than letting you use your imagination. Adventure had hints of this, but it was few and far between(but when it hit, it hit) but honestly? I can name just as many issues in Pokemon that are TWICE as horrifying because the entire world treats them as normal and the only good thing about that craphole of a universe is free health care.  For Pokemon. 



Once again, I'm not saying either is better. But for the sake of argument pokemon has much more to it than you know, and Digimon is often far less complex than you remember once you watch content that covers similar issues.

You are comparing apples to oranges with your cherrypicking, which is what you get on people for, but rather you should weigh what they have in common to be objective about a comparison.  Saying they have nothing in common is false, saying one is clearly better is your personal taste. 


-Ultimately your point boils down to one thing: you prefer overarching story arcs rather than an episodic series. While this is fine, episodic series are not inferior pound for pound. ",1541030799

What is truly amazing is how he has stayed healthy all of these years, when he is repeatedly one of the most sacked QBs in the league. They need to build an offensive line. Even if they draft a rookie QB and put him in, do you really think they would have more success compared to Eli behind this horrendous line? I do not. Eli has 15 years in the league, studying and learning defenses. His experience alone makes him greatly better than any rookie or newer QB they decide to put in.

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","I linked the wikipedia page for *law of agency* in my first reply - because the plumber works for the landlord he is, in effect, the landlord. He is the landlord's arm, if explaining that way helps you understand.

The landlord doesn't have to do the plumbing himself, he is entitled to get the plumber to do it on his behalf - just as he delegates certain matters to the lettings agency. In delegating things the landlord becomes liable for the actions of the agency and the plumber - you can sue him if they do anything wrong.

So it doesn't matter whether it was the landlord or his plumber that entered your flat - the only thing that matters is whether he/they had permission to enter your flat, or whether they had reasonable cause to believe they did.

If you say to me ""send round a plumber some time this week"", I'm going to give the plumber the keys to let himself in. I'm not going to call you back and ask you for permission again. 

In another comment you say ""I made it very clear that we did not consent to anyone entering the flat without us being there"", so that's a different matter, but it certainly is possible for other people to schedule things without you.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I think this is great in theory, but the reality is that until we get to a point where an embryo can be painlessly removed from the uterus and raised in an artificial environment, pregnancy is going to involve sacrifice and risk. Not everyone wants to be pregnant and give birth. Childbirth, even in the best environment, carries risks. Even if women aren't shamed or discriminated against for being pregnant, pregnancy can legitimately interfere with things like schoolwork and employment, depending on if it's a difficult pregnancy or what someone does for a living.

I also think it's important to recognize that there is no universal answer to the question of what the most ethical choice is. It's fine that you feel that abortion is a necessary evil, but someone else may feel that it's irresponsible to bring an unwanted child into the world and not feel right about putting a baby up for adoption.

No one should feel like abortion is their only option, but some might still feel that it's the best option for them.",1541030805

"fo76","t5_jrw25","&gt; Basher
  
I'm not sure if they've changed this from FO4-&gt;76 but Basher was previously absolutely awful because the damage didn't scale, so the further you got through the game, eve with the perk, the more meaningless the Bash damage became.  I'm hoping they better accounted for this in 76 by making Bash damage scale with weapon, which would make this perk quite good but we'll see.  I'd at least wait to pick up rank 2 until much later when you can test a bit.
  
&gt;I don't plan on using the Concentrated Fire the way you imagine. I chose Concentrated Fire specifically for the opening shot against an unsuspecting enemy. Getting a critical headshot can make life much easier.
  
I still don't think this justifies 3 perception points, also consider more cards are getting datamined - I promise you there are better choices.  Honestly a non-HS crit will probably just kill anything you hit anyways so this is unnecessary.
  
&gt;I completely disagree. Serendipity only gives me a chance to avoid damage under 30% health. I'd rather increase the probability of never having to drop below 30%. If by chance I do drop below 20%, Born Survivor is there to save me(once). Also, Dodgy has great synergy with Lone Wanderer, Action Boy and Evasive. Dodgy is actually the main reason I have Action Boy.
  
I think a single point in Born Survivor isn't too bad, I'm assuming it bypasses the stimpack animation (if it doesn't it's absolute garbage, you can press the key yourself etc).  Serendipity is **really** good if you've stacked a lot of defense in other places (like DR/HP/etc) because it avoids the damage completely and if you're tanky enough you'll survive the 30-0% range much longer and aren't likely to get 1-shot from 31%-0% bypassing it completely.  On the other hand, dodgy is only a 30% reduction for 30 points and removes the option for you to sprint away and kite if need be.  You should also consider you'll be getting hit by multiple enemies and it will deplete it rather quickly and then do nothing, opposed to say getting the raw DR perk from endurance, esp if you don't need agility.  I don't think it's *that* bad to go Dodgy/Action-boy, I just think you'd be tankier if you simply took different defensives and then you'd maintain the ability to sprint during fights or use VATS if you wished (unspec'd VATS is quite good at close range but admittedly unnecessary if you have good aim).
  
&gt;Quick Hands
  
In the datamine this has been reduced to 25%, awful for anyone except heavy weapons that have long reload times.
  
&gt;I didn't specifically put 2 points into Charisma for suppressor. I have Charisma at 6 because I plan on running with groups too. If I'm with a group, both suppressor and lone wanderer will be replaced with team perks.
  
Lone wanderer costs 4 points and makes you tankier.  Bodyguards costs 4 points and makes you tankier.  I suppose the AP from Lone Wanderer helps a lot with Dodgy if you choose to go that route but I think it takes a hit when you join a group.
  
&gt;Blocker...Shotgun range...
  
If I can more or less walk/sprint into combat chucking throwing knives then you can basically do the same thing with a shotgun.  I really hope they either nerf blocker or make it (No PvP - there's one perk that has this).  It's honestly stupidly overpowered in PvE as well because most enemies are melee and this is a huge reduction for a measily 2-3 points of Str (2 if it's your first card, and most people don't need to pick up anything from Str so it likely will be).  I could maybe get behind it if it had additional requirements like gave % based on STR but it's still just mega OP.",1541030806

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Religion, or at least religious behaviors, classify as a mental disorder, including

1) Hallucinations - Individuals have an invisible friend who speaks to them

2) Delusions - Their invisible friend can make them rich or poor, make them ill or healthy, and will do so when asked

3) Denial/Ignorance - Continued prayer in the face of evidence that it is ineffective

4) Inability to discern fantasy from reality - Acceptance of mythology for historical fact when confronted with flaws. Belief in possession by a devil.

5) Paranoia - Belief that non believers are evil and out to get them and that they are constantly being watched

6) Emotional abuse - Guilt, shame, fear are all parts of some religions, particularly christianity and controls over sex

7) Violence - Both against believers in the form of child abuse, tithing and the financial stress that comes with it for some, and specific acts like circumcision; abuse by followers as harassment and violence against non believers or those believing other faiths

8) Grandeur - Believing that one is so important they will get a planet (mormon) or that they will have an audience with god (catholicism)

By any measure, followers of religion meet some DSM definitions of mental illness and cult like behavior. It is only because of familiarity and scale that religion is excluded from definitions of psychosis. The behaviors are still highlighted in psychology texts, and many references have been tempered for political reasons rather than medical and behavioral ones.

"truezelda","t5_2tfzp","I dunno man I enjoyed BOTW but I was majorly let down by the fact that the main quest was terrible. The terribly fragmented story, the mediocre voice acting (they even used one guy for like three or four voices), and the sub-par dungeons. I'm not sure that making dungeons non-linear to a degree was a great idea. The result was interesting, but nowhere near as good as classic Zelda dungeon design. I agree also that the similar theme in each dungeon really wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Atmosphere was something that simply wasn't there. 

I was also disappointed that the most vibrant looking area, Faron, had no part to play in the main story. Faron usually *always* has a part to play, and to relegate it this time to a dragon you can't really fight and a few shrine quests is a sin. I understand that they separated the Lost Woods and Faron this time, which I understand made for more variation, but still, who doesn't want a jungle dungeon? I was hella keen for some varied dungeons that might be like hard to find, or dungeons that had something worthwhile in their treasure chests.

Weapon crafting would be cool but not very Zelda. I like the idea of upgrading items, like in Skyward Sword and to a lesser extent in ALBW, but *crafting* would take Zelda one step closer to just being Minecraft Survival Mode.  I think the next Zelda has to have a few good permanent items rather than a whole ton of shitty weapons that are useless once you progress further. It's just a pain that all the cool abilities are either too easy to get or too under-powered. (I'm looking at you, bombs).

Music. Yeah, you're absolutely right. The music in Breath of the Wild was interesting but not very memorable. It was different, for sure, but not a *better* kind of different. I don't really listen to any of the tunes for enjoyment as I do the soundtracks for most other Zelda games. Bring back a full orchestra for the next Zelda. Create new, memorable themes for the main characters, and especially all the different areas. Not just the same thing no matter where you are.",1541030806

Hell they could even make quest ""log"" and ""active quests"" different. Like you could record every quest you come across, but only have x active as currently active quests. Or even just a questline tracker so you know where you're at and where quest givers are for certain quests.


edit: The game MUST be tracking past quests and future quests due to the nature of the persistent world. Even If I've never picked up the quest for it, I will load into zone x and the game would then check my progress on the ""savetownx"" questline. If I have not started it or am before a certain point in the questline, the game will load the ""townx_underattack"" assets. If I am past the point in the questline where the town has been saved, the game will load the ""townx_herohassaved"" assets. And from a data standpoint, all the quests are already there in your save file. It's just data switches. Even on a new character, you will have all the quests in the game against your character. It will just be that the value for those quests will be something like ""msq_chapter_1=0"" for not picked up yet, ""msq_chapter_1=1"" for started, ""msq_chapter_1=12"" for second objective completed, ""msq_chapter_1=1000"" for quest complete etc. The data has always been there in the back end, just because it's not in your quest log doesn't mean you don't have information stored against your character regarding those quests. It's just going to be mostly """"msq_chapter_1=0"" not started's and ""msq_chapter_1=1000"" completed's, with a smattering of active quests among the rest.",1541030807

Well thats fantastic (sincerely), but why not just criminal justice reform for all men?  1/3 of inmates in Texas are black, 1/3 are hispanic, 1/3 are white, 92 percent are men.  70 percent of them didnt have a father.  most of them were abused, many came right out fostercare trading one state institution of abuse for another, many are on drugs, many were born on drugs, the vast majority above all other factors are poor, many dont have potable drinking water, many dont have air conditioning and suffer in sweltering conditions, many are in for-profit prisons.....  Just what the fuck makes race the single most defining feature of criminal justice reform?

To this end, I think an easier question would be which democratic candidate hasnt got identity politics shoved up their ass?  Do any of them think white guys arent the cause of all the ills in the world?  Ill vote for Cluthu the most ancient and evil horror before I vote for that.

Well other people are noticing as well, just in case you think its just me:

[Why white men are abandoning the democrats](https://www.spiked-online.com/2018/07/02/why-young-white-men-are-abandoning-the-democrats/)  One thing they fail to mention is Obama/Biden pushing the shit out of kangaroo courts on college campuses and shoving due process down the toilet.

Or an article from 3 days ago [White men are now the Democratic Party's punching bag. That's a dangerous bet to make.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/nation-now/2018/10/28/white-male-bashing-trend-dangerous-saritha-prabhu-column/1778385002/)

This is a good article [All the Good Democrats Can Do If They Stop Voting for Old White People](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xq5we/all-the-good-democrats-can-do-if-they-stop-voting-for-old-white-people)  Isnt that just hilarious?  The democrats from 2016 should talk to Vice and tell them to stop alienating huge cohorts of the electorate even if you do hate them (at least hide it).  If you look at the data I presented OLD WHITE people are the majority of early voters.

Something that has as high of an impact as a glider redeploy should only be available a handful of times during a game. IMO maybe 3-4 times (roughly a 5 minute cooldown). 

Could add an ""ability charge"" mechanic on top of that where Sprinting, damage to player built structures, damage to players, builds placed, eliminations, ect could all add up to reduce the cooldown of the glider redeploy. Making aggressive play more appealing.

**Cavalry:** WT!Olwen because of sheer power, or maybe Gunnthr√† because she ca pack a punch whilst also debuffing and being a legendary hero. Yeah I‚Äôm gonna go with Gunnthr√†

Round 2 is tough!! Team1 has the speed but team 2 has the defence but I'll have to go with team 2. Gaara and onoki's flight give them a huge advantage, fourth raikage can tank kakashi's raikiri (tanked Sasuke's chidori) and is too fast for Kamui. 

Jinton will be very deadly against bee if he goes full bijuu, gaara can stop v2 bee with his defense tho bee's lighting counters gaara and raikage can hold down 7 gates gai for a while, jinton wins over Kamui in range and versatility

I also had managed to stumble onto a career (technical editing) that allows me to work from anywhere with an internet connection. Finally, my sister in California told me I could always return and live with her if things didn't work out, so I always had a back-up plan.

I encourage people to live in other countries for awhile if possible. I think learning a new culture teaches us a little humility, and we also have to use skills we maybe didn't realize we had--for example, when I got here I ddn't know much Spanish, so I had to rely on a lot of nonverbal communication.

3. What else are you into? Specific hobbies or interests? Maybe something where people gather to do something you do.

4. Dating sites. But instead of just looking for 'the one' just say yes to whoever and meet up and at least be friends with people. Then try and build from that.

The only BM truly in need of a fix is kumar and Rahul is a decent monster but being a LD nat5 he could use an adjustment, and the best place to do it for Kumar is on the S1 and for Rahul on the S3. If Shazam had base stats like Ritesh he would be deserving of ones god-tier runes and you would see him a lot more on defense, but in terms of skills he is fine (I‚Äôve run into some truly annoying Shazams on defense and they were worthy because someone had decided to sacrifice very good runes for him).  

Overall a whole overhaul of the family like you suggest, I really just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary. Kumar‚Äôs S1 needs an adjustment, and giving him a relevant debuff/effect could make him very good actually. Another important thing that falls in ritesh‚Äôs favour, which when he already the strongest monk in terms of skill types just makes him even more supreme among the family, is their base stats.",1541030813

I'm not complaining about losing 3 endurance charges worth of stats, if I dodge the spear and took the flameblast I would lose over 3 max resist worth of stats which is pretty significant. 

AA is only useful on builds that don't actually move like Flicker (lol), conc path, and PP builds using either LW or body swap. There's probably a few others. Then again why would I use AA if I could dodge the hit anyway?

It's not like it's the worst aura reservation in the game (lul vitality w/o watcher's eye), but there is no reason to use it over other options. It's call opportunity cost, if you're not one of 1% of builds that can get 100% out of it there's no point.

-- went to the library, there's a buffet, seafood and all the stuff.

--- ask the caretaker why the buffet is at the library.  I was told because all my life I want to eat on library, but it's forbidden, but this one is my library.

-- went to a hallway, and recognize two person i haven't seen for so long, the MILFy ex-flatmate, and her same sex partner.

-- asked the caretaker what they're doing here, and I was told this is the house of what I like.  I told the caretaker ""but I don't want the Ms. MILFy's partner!"".  Care taker flick his finger, two guys appear from the corner, took the person that i don't want, and interrogate her.  Ask the caretaker what's happening, and I was told the two guys will gave that person a problem that will make her leave... if she could.

-- went to the pool, saw lots of people enjoying.  Ask the caretaker who are those, and I was told this are all the people you know, including those you don't like, if someone gave you trouble, I flick a finger and a shark will appear to take the troublemaker.  Told care taker, nah let them enjoy.

--  A few days of enjoying the house, I told the care taker, I'm bored, I want to leave for a while and see what's beyond.  I was told do so, i'm free to do so.  So I attempted, but everytime I try to go past the garden (a very beautiful garden), giant birds attack me, ostrich, emu, and some other big black birds.

"MakingaMurderer","t5_3b2cn","&gt; I don't think we even know when it was lost. But there's no indication that either side ever thought it was important. I believe it was only relatively recently that Zellner asked for it.

At Avery's trial, his defence, rather stupidly in my opinion, wanted the jury to believe that the bus driver saw Teresa at around 3:30 or just after, and the truck driver saw Teresa's vehicle leave around the same time.  Therefore, Teresa had left the property, so the Zipperer message was of no importance.  The fact their time frame was completely wrong didn't help Avery. 

Had they listened to Avery, worked on the time frame more, even questioned if the truck driver had put his clock back in his cab, so was actually there an hour before he thought he was, then maybe that would have been more believable.  I believe Wiegert just wanted the bus driver to put Teresa at the salvage yard on the Monday, which unfortunately just confused Strang and Butting.  

I have a feeling, they just accepted what they had been told the message said, even though that didn't match with the known length of call, because it wasn't relevant to their strategy.  If they had made the argument, that Teresa went to the Zipperers after Avery's, that the message left would prove that, taking into account Wiegert thought the same before the vehicle was found, then tell the jury that the state has lost it, all three sources, that might have created reasonable doubt.

Seriously SMGs severely need a buff! I mean actual buff. Not just buffing one SMG, kinda buffing another one but nerfing the headshot dmg, and literally nerfing the rest of the SMGs.


It seems everyone in every lobby is running ARs. And I mean competitively speaking why blame them?

1) EVERY SINGLE SMG need a MINIMUM of 6 shots to kill whereas ARs need 4-5

2) ARs downside is suppose to be slower ADS, but they can circumvent this by running gung ho and making their ads instant. 

3) SMGs have more recoil and need more bullets to destroy armor.

Just because autistic people's brains might look more like a typical male brain on a scan, doesn't necessarily mean that they are like neurotypical male brains but with more extreme masculine traits.",1541030829

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Unless you are actually allergic, it really isn't that bad. Venoms aren't used to cause pain. They paralyze or cause organ failures. 

Smashing a finger with a hammer is significantly more painful.

Broken bones are on a whole other level.

Because a venom is meant to cause actual harm, by the time the dose is large enough to cause that harm, it destroys the nerves that would carry the pain. In this case, a THW is meant to paralyze.

Insects are relatively small compared to some snakes.

To compare a THW to a copperhead, would be like comparing a rubber band with a paper shot to a 5.56 rifle.

A copperhead is a non-lethal snake, and even with antivenom the venom will cause pain for 10 days or more. A THW will last for a couple minutes.

I personally don't think I have a high pain tolerance. But if you told me to get stung by a THW for 5$, it is literally worth it. The pain is not significant compared to a really venomous animal, or an actual injury.

Not wishing any of those things on a child of mine, so if I do get married and want kids we'll just have to adopt and hope that the intelligence is more nurture than nature. After all I did grow up watching things like Kratts' Creatures, Bill Nye the Science Guy and The Magic School Bus when most of the people I know I'm smarter than were watching things like Ren and Stimpy or Beavis and Butthead, or more recently things like Spongebob, so nurture very well could have played a significant role.

Then again the right woman could probably still convince me to have biological children with her. After all, if those kids hit the jackpot and get only the good traits they'll be fucking set.",1541030833

"reddeadredemption","t5_2rn7o","After about 5 hours I finally managed to encounter it. 

As I mentioned in my previous post, I cleared out the O'Driscoll camp at Hanging Dog Ranch, dealt with two seperate random encounters in the general area (one a guy attacked by a wolf, the other a moonshiner whose cart had broken down), and met the stranger in the mountains who gives you the task of finding rock carvings, and also done the money lending mission which sends you after the white cougar in the mountain cave.

Since that, I discovered a second unmarked O'Driscoll camp hidden in the forest [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/GYboTJf.png).

That STILL wasn't enough. I couldn't even camp in the area, because there was ""too much activity"".

What seems to have done it is finding and inspecting a Native Burial Site [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/Ymx49AI.png).

After I had done that, I started walking north back towards where the Buck should be, and was amazed when the game told me I was in a Legendary Animal area and to look for clues. A short hunt later and a couple of Rolling Block Rifle shots to the head and it's done!

Hope this helps, but honestly who the heck knows. Maybe I was just a very good boy today and the game decided I had earned a treat.",1541030833

I did ween sugar in the weeks leading up to keto and I know what sugar withdrawal is, so it wasn‚Äôt cold turkey and don‚Äôt think this is it. 
Example of yesterday -

Breakfast - 2 egg cups (eggs, chopped bacon, chopped shallots, couple leaves spinach, Parmesan)

Lunch - keto chilli beef mince (prob around cup and half), half avocado, 3 cherry tomatoes, 1/4 fresh lime juiced, 2 rings of red onion, teaspoon sour cream, grated cheese

Dinner - 1 hamburger patty, 4 slices pickles, slice cheese, 2 cherry tomatoes, 1 ring red onion, 1 lettuce wrap, teaspoon siracha/mayo mix 

I had two hamburgers prepared for dinner but just couldn‚Äôt eat the second (too full).  Boyfriend did eat the second but he also runs 5km a day and doesn‚Äôt need to lose weight. 

How does that sound?? I‚Äôm planning on starting to track in week 4, I‚Äôm not obsessed with immediate weight loss (although I need to lose around 30kg) just want to get used to low carbs first to give myself the best chance of long term change. ",1541030834

They spread out the releases of their originals rather than dropping them all in a single month. It‚Äôs a different way of approaching the spacing of their shows. Rather than being like a network and spacing single shows out over 9 months, Netflix will give you something in full and then a bit later something else in full.

Practically, 250 watts is a slippery target. Different motors make vastly different amounts of torque, and some feel a ton stronger than others - Bosch performance line CX, for example, makes 75Nm of torque, while Shimano's Steps 6000 makes just 50Nm. Both are rated as 250 watts, but the Bosch feels much faster and stronger.

What's more, they can just about all be easily derestricted so they continue to assist you at higher speeds. You can either fuck with the wheel diameters in the system, or connect derestriction dongles. Or buy a bike that's rated for off-road use only and just try not to be a cunt on the bike path.

I think this has been tested with DET instead and found to work. I just like that the name came out as a neat-sounding one instead of something awkward like procyprocybin.

Though now that I google that, it was actually [4-HO-5-MeO-DMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Hydroxy-5-methoxydimethyltryptamine) and that article already lists an alternate name as psilomethoxin, I guess I should have done more research on less common alternate names. In the current version of this system it would be named psiloxocin instead.",1541030836

This happened in the UK when Prince Phillip married Queen Elizabeth.

From Wikipedia:

Philip was born into the Greek and Danish royal families. He was born in Greece, but his family was exiled from the country when he was an infant. After being educated in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, he joined the British Royal Navy in 1939, aged 18. From July 1939, he began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth, whom he had first met in 1934. During the Second World War he served with the Mediterranean and Pacific Fleets.

After the war, Philip was granted permission by King George VI to marry Elizabeth. Before the official announcement of their engagement in July 1947, he abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles and became a naturalised British subject, adopting the surname Mountbatten from his maternal grandparents.
