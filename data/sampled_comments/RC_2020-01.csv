Just give me a show with amazing characters and some action. Hell! I played with cars and trucks as a kid, I played with Legos (I even played with the ""girl"" branded Legos.

Once in a rare while I get a really good placement.  I had one a week or so ago on Hawkins.  It was in a corner behind some obstructions.  Usually there's a generator in that corner and my general luck is the totem would be there right next to the generator.  


Since there was no generator there this time, it seems the players just never went to that corner to look for the totem.  Lasted 90% of the match and actually affected play.  


My other experience with Ruin is if it doesn't pop immediately, I get teams that are proficient enough with skill checks that gens aren't exploding as a minimum and just as often, they're seemingly hitting all of their great skill checks or just not getting very many skill checks.

"SiegeAcademy","t5_3jojv","If your team is already running a breach denial op (Kaid or Bandit) you can use mute as a soft roamer. Not sure if that‚Äôs the correct term for it but I‚Äôll explain.

I like to use him as an anchor for a room adjacent to site that is essential for enemy attacks. Like I said if the team already has a Kaid or Bandit then you can save your jammers for yourself. Place them around the room you choose to defend to prevent drone access to you as well as be able to maneuver through Lion‚Äôs drone as well as be immune or quickly nullify Dokkebi calls. Setting up your jammers this way can help you remain undetected, or force the enemy to use utility in an attempt to make you rotate to site. 

When defending outside of site make sure you don‚Äôt overly expose yourself, or peek long angles against a team full of ACOG users. If you‚Äôre using Shotty then hold close tight angles. It‚Äôs also helpful to have teammates give you a shield for cover. (If they‚Äôre agreeing to help you out. Easiest in a 5 stack)

Lastly, having free jammers makes mute a menace on staircases. No drones can get up the staircases and the attackers will always be disadvantaged when trying to push up your stairs. All you need a Jager or Wamai to get rid of a nade or 2, then use shotty to contest the stairs on enemies. 

The breach denial capabilities are great, but the information denial to the offensive team can shut a push down or slow it to a point where too much time burns off the clock. The drone denial makes him great for holding chokepoints, stairs, or rooms near to or above the objective.",1577836802

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","LOL I did understand what did you write - but I do believe that Turkey is very aware of this possibility, thus they are supporting the al-Sadr in his effort to gain power, and as matter of fact - any politician in Iraq, which want to keep Iraq intact. 

That is why they are ""close"" with Iran - they both (Turkey and Iran) have potentially same problem with the Kurdish minority. 

That said, the Turkey, or better to say Erdoƒüan and AKP, have developed alliance with some conservative Kurdish Sunni politician and tribes against leftist and PKK, but if the KRG (lead by Barzani) achieve true independence - that may rise the same expectations and amongst their domestic +20 million Kurds... So, I have no doubt that they are aware of this. 

But, there is another issue: They (Turkey aka AKP aka Erdoƒüan) will also like to restore some Ottoman Empire's lost territories, which are today part of the Iraq and KRG. 

If they can not ""snap"" any territories from KRG or Iraq, then it is better to have Iraq as it is, without independent KRG. But, if the Iraq become true ""failed state"" and become divided and in territorial meaning, then (under excuse to protect local Turkmens population) they may invade and Iraq. 

And, as I see the Erdoƒüan as megalomaniac, I will not be surprised if his ultimate goal in Iraq is no less than taking Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk region.  

So, they are ambivalent for now, but and waiting for the glimpse of chance LOL",1577836803

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","The first serious relationship I had was with an abuser. She would always be super chill with everyone we hung out with, and then behind closed doors, she was a literal sociopath. 

* She lied to her only parent and would steal money from them. She lied to me about it, even when confronted, it was used for drugs and alcohol.

* We used to play wrestle until she started exclusively going for my groin. Punching, slapping, squeezing, it didn't matter what it was, if she could cause me pain, she would. This resulted in me being extremely anxious when any future women have been in their vicinity. I was tormented for months by her in this way. I stopped the play wrestling because I just couldn't handle 30 minutes of her trying to cause me ridiculous amounts of pain.

* She constantly started fights for no reason. To the point where she could call someone hot in a movie and if I said someone was hot, it was a fight. I didn't love her, or didn't care about her because I said that. This didn't end until I apologized and said I didn't care about that person.
 
* She accused me of cheating frequently because in fact, she was actually cheating. No proof or anything, just would start telling me I was cheating on her.
 
* She once got mad at me over nothing while driving, and started doing 180KPH while yelling at me and not looking at the road. She'd also do the same while I was driving, trying to distract me.

The final straw was when she admitted she cheated on me 2 weeks into our 1.5 year relationship, and more than a dozen times during. The last of which, involved fucking her own cousin.

I realized that I should never be treated like shit again. I cut all contact. She still tries to ask my friends and family she sees around about me. My friends thankfully had my back.

Turns out after we broke up, everyone came to me about how she either came on to them, or told them about our sex life, which based on whether we were in a fight or not, was great or awful.

She is a truly awful human being who fucked her way through at least 3 friend groups after I dumped her and ruined countless people's lives with her shitty being.",1577836804

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","The Reylo thing never felt right.  It was obvious in TFA that Finn and Rey had an attraction.  But no, she likes the psychopathic torturer responsible for the deaths of millions across the galaxy.

Another issue was Poe's sexuality, it was pretty ambiguous through the first two movies.  Then, in the last movie, they added an unnecessary plot point, and a 5 second ""you wanna hook up"" glance, for the sole purpose of clarifying he is straight.  Then they add a same-sex kissing scene between two characters who are little more than extras (one of them was just an extra)...then they remove that scene in some overseas markets.

Simply leaving Poe's sexuality as ambiguous would have been much better than all of this pandering.",1577836804

If Tesla can achieve an Apple-alike market position (which is a **BIG** if), then a 1.3x20 = 26 trillion dollars valuation is pretty much the probable outcome - dominant companies make a lot of money and are valuable.

One TSLA share worth 6 figures is within the spectrum of possibilities.

"heelys","t5_2vgye","I have a size 6 womans shoe in Heelys of course that I can't wear I just needed the wheels but that's actually a size 5 in men's. According to Skates.com and Heelys.com the Heelys size chart shows that whatever the women's US size number is its actually one humber smaller men's US. Heelys.com only shows to men's size 9 but if you look and compare the woman's size to the men's ones in the same column it shows a woman's a number 10 for the men's number 9 So I'm not sure where you got that info. 

Not mad or anything I'm just curious as to where that info came from or are you meaning that even though a size 8 in women's would be the number 7 in men's but the true size measurement in women's 8 is really a 6 and a half?

Skate.com has a better Heelys size chart here.

Except Turly showed he isn't. There is nothing in the constitution requiring the articles to be sent to the Senate in order for the president to be impeached. Neither you nor Feldman have made that case.

They did follow the process.

It's not a roadblock, just politics. This is a political process, after all. McConnell showed he would not respect the oath he took.

Meanwhile new inforamation has come out pretty much confirming the quid pro quo (again), and Bolton no longer has an excuse not to testify.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","The sad part is that most people at Google have known all along that alienating users is an absolutely terrible long-term strategy, but people in leadership positions are always thinking they're the exception. Or maybe they're so full of themselves they think that users will actually *appreciate* things like Android notifications that are basically ads. Part of it might be due to bringing in executives from outside (e.g. Vic Gundotra, the former MS exec who was in charge of Google+ and seemingly did everything he could to sabotage it), but I think it's mostly the prisoner's dilemma in action. The senior leadership could have stopped a lot of that stuff, but lately they seem to be escalating to burning employees' trust as well as users', so instead of turning Google into another Microsoft, they're turning into another Oracle or IBM.

Basically, at least as far as I've been able to determine, The Windows Shell overrides the default menu drawing behaviour and uses white for the selection background. (System default is a blue colour- the one you see in task manager). If I had to guess, I'd say the change was made for dark mode, but it was not made conditionally, so when not in dark mode, it still uses a light colour.

Similar to pro life/choice both sides argue extremes. Liberals want abortions at 8 months.... 

I digress, the argument is more of common sense gun laws. Universal registry, stricter background checks. And you keep your 2nd amendment. So if you collect guns, hunt, and can pass improved common sense laws and stricter background checks I‚Äôm all for you having a battle/assault rifle (I guess, if you need to have one... or an arsenal like my Texas buddies claim to have). 

Again this wouldn‚Äôt stop all criminals or all mass shootings but to deny common sense gun laws is a no brainer to me. I mean we just passed a federal law to raise the age to buy cigarettes and they‚Äôre trying to change regs and laws on vapes or whatever they‚Äôre called.",1577836806

"movies","t5_2qh3s","the prestige. it isn't just about 2 magicians who constantly try to get back at each other. it's about blind obsession as well. in the case of angier he was blind both with rage and jealousy. first he was obsessed with getting revenge and to getting borden to admit what he did wrong. later in the movie he's blinded and obsessed over borden's incredible trick, so much so that he completely misses the opportunity tesla's machine gave him. angier only needed to use his machine once. once he had a perfect clone of himself he could recreate borden's trick. but he was obsessed with the trick he thought it was in his mind that the option completely escapes him and he resorts to murder, mass murders in fact. his obsession is so potent he walks into that machine every night afraid that he'll be committing suicide each time, but either way being a murderer every time.

borden's own obsession with his trick lead to the downfall of his marriage and his wife's suicide, his brothers girlfriend, and later on his brother himself.

i just love that movie, it plays a trick on the audience in so many ways. everytime i rewatch it i notice something different. it took many viewings to realize the underlying theme of the movie is obsession, not just the endless cycle of revenge. different kinds of obsessions caused all kinds of grief. it's not even like the movie hid that theme much since tesla says it outright basically. but the movie has so much else going on you kind of don't think about it.",1577836807

I get that there are definitely scenarios where you don't heal here. Both times I assumed they had adrenaline, because that's the most obvious, but I also understand if the game is turning into a nail biter and doing the gen is the only way you're even going to get one person out. There's also the scenario that you're in a swf and you know someone else is getting chased so you have time, but that definitely wasn't the case with these two, and something I've seen in general.

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","CAN bus data showing a Nominal full pack capacity of 75.95 kWh (310 mi * 245 Wh/mi) and 4.5% (nominally 3.4 kWh) buffer.  The 245 Wh/mi rating is hard-coded based on EPA tests.  SoC reaches 0% when you're down to just the buffer left, but you would actually have to go below 0% and burn through the buffer to achieve 310 miles at the rated 245 Wh/mi, which means Tesla is choosing to misrepresent the usable range of their pack by the same 4.5%.

There's many sources for capacity on the LR pack.  The Wikipedia article references a [comment](https://electrek.co/2017/08/08/tesla-model-3-battery-packs-50-kwh-75-kwh-elon-musk/) by Elon of ""~75"" during a conference call, while the [EPA certification](https://electrek.co/2017/08/07/tesla-model-3-new-details-revealed/) lists either 78 or 80.5 kWh, and leaked Tesla service manuals refer to it as 74 kWh.

On the Twitter Page, there was pinned to the top, something like ""Go here for more"" and a link to Champions for Christ Facebook Page.  Given I made some Taylor Swift tweets or something controversial, new people would find me on Champions for Christ, and through God, I would answer questions at times. There were times I felt locked down in my apartment for several days when I felt I really got a big crowd that was really interested in the right way.

There ended up a lot of Taylor Swift Prophetic Intercession like this.  Some of it was deleted, and rebuilt, and deleted again.  Whatever is there currently is what is there.  Some of it became a little personal.   That stuff wasn't done again.

How much of it ended up being prophetic?  I don't know.  I was dwelling on God's Law and working somethings out with an audience.  That being said, I may not have had the bigger picture at the time.",1577836811

"ProgrammerAnimemes","t5_y8c63","First meme of the year! ~~Because of course you're all on UTC time, right?~~

Explanation: &gt;!`document.all` is a non-standard property introduced by early versions of Internet Explorer (IE). It returns an [`HTMLAllCollection`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#the-htmlallcollection-interface), which contains all elements on the current page as a flat list. In the early days of the Web, checking for the presence of `document.all` was a way to identify that the browser was IE. Knowing that the browser was IE meant that you could run code that should only run in IE, like workarounds.!&lt;

&gt;!Nowadays, browsers (including IE) are written in such a way that scripts using values in `document.all` won't break, but scripts that check for `document.all` won't mistakenly detect the browser as IE. They do this by letting `HTMLAllCollection` act as the falsy value `undefined` in many cases, including for `typeof` checks. In other words, the browser is lying to the script.!&lt;

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","The origins are very blurred but while the Uralic peoples originated very early from Siberia they settled in and around the Urals. The proto-Magyars split off early on for lower Urals and the Pontic plain where they came to contact with a lot of Caucasian people (Iranian and Indo-European nomads) and mixed a lot with them. The Magyar bloodline diluted post 4th century quite some and was overwhelmed by the European people.

As you may know a loose connection is found with the Finns and Estonians, sharing the same language family, but other than that Hungarians have most in common with nearby Slovaks and Slavs with very little Asian and Central Asian remains. More Asian connections remain on the Romanian side Hungarians which possibly had less contact with outsiders because of the Carpathian mountains.

To sum up, yes they're supposed to be more Asian, but the original Uralic then Ugric peoples when migrating to the European side of the Urals mixed with Caucasians, basically forming the Magyars, which then slowly crept up on Eastern Europe to end up in Pannonia. Some even connect them to the Bulgars and Xiangnu (pseudo Huns) from Central Asia, so they're quite the heterogenous populace.",1577836812

lt's also forget that in season one Deb seperated from Dan and that throughout the next few seasons they weren't together and she was trying to get a divorce but Dan wouldn't let her and basically forced her to stay. Tried to turn Nate on her as well. This was before Keith slept with Deb.

Let's also not forget that Dan tried to get with Karen because Keith was with her and he felt guilty at what he had done.

You keep circling around comparing what Keith one time to what Dan did the entire series. It Keith a victim? Yes Dan shot him because he was jealous. You can't say that Keith sleeping with Deb is anywhere near what Dan did the entire series because it's not a comparable things at all.",1577836813

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","I'd much rather the Dragon Warhammer be a rare drop from a demi-boss and a useful weapon rather than it being thrown in a shop after a Grandmaster Quest that required Level 80s; meaning that by the time you can equip it, it was useless. That said, there isn't a great reason for why Shamans have the Warhammer, but the same can be said for some other items (e.g. why do monkeys have the Scimitar and bugs have the Chainbody?).

Also, Dragon Claws makes a lot of sense to come from Raids seeing as they are very powerful and that Raids 1 is directly connected to the Dragonkin. The original implementation of the Harpoon, Thrown Axes, and Sword wasn't the best, but they have since resolved that and the new locations are much better. And unlike RS2 and RS3, at least OSRS makes the weapons either useful or valuable except for the Hasta instead of throwing them on endgame content where Level 60 items are long past the point of being relevant.

For example, in RS3, the Dragon Hasta, Knives, and Ward (a dragon shield for Magic...) are dropped by Muspah, which are unlocked from a Grandmaster Quest that requires 3 other Grandmaster quests... I'd say that is a bit worse than putting a Sword and Thrown Axes in Raids; at least those items were designed to be strong weapons even if it only panned out for hte Thown Axe.

As for TDs and the Platebody, my issue with it is had no reason to be there. It is fair to prefer it coming from a more involved monster, but since Mithrils dropped the Full Helm, it makes a lot of sense for Addy to drop the Kite and Rune to drop the Plate. And I also do think repairing a broken lump with a chainbody in the Dragon Forge to make the Platebody works a lot better than melting down 3 pieces of a demon to make a Platebody from scratch with a silly hammer; I think they claimed you are just repairing pieces of a broken platebody, but those are very clearly limbs from the TDs. I mean you can see its eye and horn, foot, and claw; that is not part of a broken platebody but raw lumps of Dragon metal.",1577836814

I haven't read it so if you see issues with it point them out for sure. I doubt that people know other's intelligence levels to recommend them to go in certain directions.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Did you seriously just cite me back exactly the same study that I cited to you? I mean WTF? I said to you, ""Here's a study and it's problems"" and you reply ""But are there problems with this study?"" Wtf am I even supposed to say? You have me stumped but like, What?!?? 

&gt; Idk what weird pictures means exactly 

Then you've never looked at an IQ test. They're primarily patterns in abstract pictures.

&gt; My argument is that why many women worldwide aren't intelligent or even some that are and aren't pursuing education is caused by sexism and traditional societal norms.

Your argument is ""Hey, do you see a problem with this paper that you said you see a problem with?""

Throwing people into gold rank matches (which is what it does for at least 2 of your very first matches, get a new account and try if you don't believe me. Or just watch any streamer thats done unranked to GM. First match: gold. Second match: higher gold. third match: plat, etc.) and letting them fall or rise from there is just a bad experience for whoever they get paired with/against until they get where they should be. Just start everyone in bronze for their first season that way there's only one way to go.

I never said it affects my ability to climb, I already understand I just have to play more matches and my true average win percentage will take me to where I need to be. You're putting words in my mouth that you'd like to hear. I've only said the weird experiences I've had, like that an accurate matchmaker wouldn't put me in a 2800 game when I'm only a 1800 tank. Or that it wouldn't place a player brand new to the concept of competitive shooters higher than someone with over 3000 hours of experience in the same game.

Quick play MMR also wouldn't make a difference no matter what level you switched to comp, as you are playing the exact same game at the exact same level of play. Literally, you're not worse in quick play or comp, you are the same player playing the same way you would.",1577836817

You may have better luck online on one of those Korean e-commerce sites but I assume you're on holiday and navigating a Korean online shop is not going to be easy.

He asked for sources that support your claim that:

&gt;Yeah, look, most panhandlers are not poor or underprivileged.

You have not provided sources that support that claim. You provided an anecdote of one panhandler. That's like using an article about the moon landing to say ""most people named Neil have walked on the moon."" If you bothered to read your other source, you'd see it literally argues the opposite of your claim. The writer of that article did not find any panhandlers that were not poor.

Do you have a source that supports your claim that most panhandlers are not poor?",1577836819

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","Some people already gave the most obvious answer, there was no opportunity for there isn't anything ""special"" between these two characters

As a One Piece reader, and a Nami fan, I prefer to look at this matter from the character perspective. What does the queen think of perverts?

[https://i.imgur.com/FrlreX2.png](https://i.imgur.com/FrlreX2.png)

She obviously dislike pervs, and does not enjoy them peeping on her while she takes a bath. This becomes a consistent trait in Nami's character as we see post-timeskip:

[https://i.imgur.com/qnyBEk1.png](https://i.imgur.com/qnyBEk1.png)

Perv around her and you'll get a well-deserved punishment. Which leads us to the arc you mentioned, Punk Hazard; from an outside point of view Sanji's actions, as funny as they could be to the audience, are reprehensible. But, the argument of most weight here is how Nami reacts to Sanji's perving on her body...

[https://i.imgur.com/iYBcxxH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/iYBcxxH.jpg)

...she was disgusted and very angry about such behavior towards her body. And as of the Wano arc, her outlook on pervs and Sanji himself remains consistent:

[https://i.imgur.com/27DlyZ0.png](https://i.imgur.com/27DlyZ0.png)

Although, given the direction the anime adaptation is taking, I wouldn't be surprised if this last scene in particular doesn't get animated lol

There was nothing to prove, because as one of my One Piece ""teachers"" once said, Sanji's delusion is 'loving all \[beautiful\] women and believing all women love him.' and Nami has been stablished to hate pervs and their actions (her words actually reminded me of her seiyuu's answer about who Nami trusts the most, even Usopp got a honorable mention while Sanji didn't). Despite what the anime may convey, that hasn't changed. The real missed opportunity was giving Sanji's character a chance to grow out of this delusion, which could've happened if it wasn't for Pudding erasing his memories of the last moment they shared at WCI. But, that's just wishful thinking",1577836819

I'd really try to keep it under two weeks to be on the safe side.  Even better, space it out so you're not taking them daily.  I'd rather c/t heroin a dozen times then taper off benzos again.

|How does his gadget work|[0:42](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=42)|After hijacking the drone, the drone turns white. You cannot move it outside or take it with you, and the attackers lost that drone for the whole round, cannot regain it back. If captured twitch drones, you can use her ability. How to get moving drones with 100% consistency. Examples given on ESL maps.|
|Basic ideas behind Mozzie's gadget|[2:19](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=139)|Shooting the pests at the side of the stairs depending of if drones are going uphill/downhill &gt; if not expect, the alert signal will be not enough to stop the drone. Bait tactics as well, how to make your pest a little more twitchproof. Examples given on ESL maps.|
|A bit more advanced ideas behind Mozzie's gadget|[3:32](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=212)|Baiting tactics with barbed wires + pests on stairs (especially good if drones going downhill). Idea of destructible floor + barbed wires as well. Examples given on ESL maps.|
|Even more ideas on how to use Mozzie's pests|[4:55](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=295)|Denying the whole window with a pest that cannot be drone from outside, countering that as an attacker, countering the counter of the attacker as a defender (lol yeah). Examples given on ESL maps. Also, a PL twitch clip given.|
|With that being said, deny a hatch with a single pest|[7:21](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=441)|With a similar idea, deny the hatch, examples &amp; a PL twitch clip given.||Mute vs Mozzie|[8:26](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=506)|Mute is better if you have want to primarily deny the drones as defender + he usually has some mute jammer spares for the reinforcement, whereas Mozzie denies intel and possible moves the intel, way more flexible than Mute.|
|Valkyrie vs Mozzie|[9:43](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=583)|Valkyrie's job is to put cameras and do whatever she wants, she cannot deny the information nor move their cams, whereas Mozzie can. However, Mozzie has to manually lose time (and sometimes he cannot do that because of a situation) to, once hijacked the drone, give the intel to his team with that drone|
|Echo vs Mozzie|[10:47](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=647)|Echo has a totally different role than Mozzie, just brought it up because people still compare apples and bananas.|
|Mozzie's cons in short|[11:13](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=673)|Cannot block bigger areas, has to move manually the drones to get intel and his pests can be ""wasted"".|
|a very advanced use of pest drones|[11:47](https://youtu.be/2HQNakhxr3M?t=707)|Using a bait with the alert signal, pest is twitchproof and cannot be destroyed, whereas you cannot hijack the drone with that pest|

I think I became more annoyed about things, and less tolerant. I don‚Äôt think I ever liked most of the jokes but I put up with them. Now I don‚Äôt really put up with them, and there‚Äôs better things to do with my time.

I did change but I‚Äôd say less ‚Äúchange‚Äù as in a neutral thing, and more ‚Äúmatured.‚Äù Like I feel like I‚Äôm not childish anymore.I feel like I did grow up. I play less video games. I want to meet a woman to spend the rest of my life with. I don‚Äôt wanna see and hear the same things over and over again that are just okay. I want things I like and love. I don‚Äôt wanna waste time. I pay for things and think ‚Äúwill I want this in a year or two?‚Äù Instead of now. I save up for things. I worry about the immediate and long term at the same time.

I eat and drink the same way too. I feel like I didn‚Äôt just merge onto a different highway but I‚Äôm going a different direction completely. I‚Äôm driving away from self destruction and recklessness and more towards self-preservation. I want to nurture and take care of myself and others and things I care about.

I‚Äôve heard before that the day you start worrying about your mom is the day you‚Äôre not a kid anymore.

This is 100% true.

But I think it was coincidence that I had a health scare recently that things changed. I wanted to make changes but it took my mom‚Äôs divorce, a new job, and my health to shake off the last leaves of youth still clinging to me.

And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still like being funny and silly. Just not all the time and I wanna be more serious. But I can feel things being different.",1577836824

If I was at school it would be a different story but I‚Äôm not, so no point in dwelling on it.

Honestly I‚Äôm not a party person anyway- even if I was at school with my friends, where I would definitely be invited to some kind of party, I‚Äôm not sure I would even go. I kind of just view New Years as another day (it‚Äôs the least special holiday in my opinion), so I‚Äôm perfectly content staying home with my family or just hanging out with 1-2 friends who also aren‚Äôt doing anything. The only reason I start to feel bad is when I see other people‚Äôs snapchats and posts- FOMO is real.

It‚Äôs the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù traits‚Äîwhich can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual‚Äîare the means by which your status as ‚Äúman‚Äù can be taken away.

Toxic masculinity is also talked about to highlight and address the nature of domestic violence, rape, murder &amp; assault against women and men, perpetrated by mainly males. There's an obvious male violence issue when you realize that men commit the majority of violent crimes (except for child abuse, but I think it's worth noting that there's a lot more single mothers which could explain that). 

Although women comprise more than half the U.S. population, they committed only 14.7% of the homicides noted during [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1635092) study interval. In contrast to men, who killed nonintimate acquaintances, strangers, or victims of undetermined relationship in 80% of cases, women killed their spouse, an intimate acquaintance, or a family member in 60% of cases.

So I don't think toxic femininity would be as detrimental, but it could still be a problem.. I guess? The only things I could think of that would maybe count as toxic femininity is just symptoms of toxic masculinity, like the idea that men shouldn't be able to defend themselves against an abusive woman, the idea that women can't rape men, etc.",1577836825

This may be decreased with spotter plane.

That's because people don't adjust aim after the ship cloaks. If they did, the shells would still land near you (but be very inaccurate).

By default their aiming ""point"" is going to be against the side of your hull somewhere. When the hull disappears, the aiming point keeps going straight through thin air... and has to go a while before hitting water.

If they thought he might be a franchise QB then they wouldn't have let him fall to the 5th round. He looked bad enough in preseason that this sub and even Chargers beat writers thought he wouldn't make the team and wouldn't have had any practice reps since then.

He wandered around and then came through my line. When I asked him how he was doing that day he replied with ""Well I'm impotent so..."" I just told him to have a nice day. 

A few weeks ago, different job but still retail, I asked a guy if he was ready for the holidays and he happily replied that his wife had kicked him out and his children wanted nothing to do with him so he was going to spend the holiday getting getting drunk and giving his grandkids money. I stopped asking people about their holiday plans after that.

*****
&gt; SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea&amp;#039;s leader, Kim Jong-un, ?said his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, its official media reported on Wednesday in the strongest indication yet that the country could soon resume such testing.

&gt; North Korea has not conducted a long-range missile test or a nuclear test in more than two years.

&gt; For weeks, American officials feared Mr. Kim might test an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.Mr. Kim is expected to make his annual New Year&amp;#039;s address within hours, and it remains unclear if a test is imminent.

"SelfAwarewolves","t5_3g3zk","Wikipedia isn't the source to cite for what is/isn't left wing. The use of the term arose between economic ideologies on property ownership and class hierarchy. The historical divide between left and right wing for the last 100 years has been placed between parties that support capitalist markets versus those that do not.

This is also the current dominant political divide globally. The only reason some people think liberal parties like Democrats in the USA are ""left"" is because the US political spectrum is just a two party binary.

To the criteria: you can't support egalitarianism and equality if you also support a rigidity hierarchical and anti-egalitarian economic system. It's inconsistent to claim to support equality, egalitarianism or hierarchy if you also support capitalism.

This is why it's more common globally for liberal centrist parties to form coalitions with right wing parties than it is for them to form coalitions with left wing parties.",1577836829

Not every guy gets the girl. Not every ending has that fairy tale quality of ""happily ever after."" 

We're not guaranteed relationships, let alone relationships with Person X. I'm completely fine with characters like Tsunade or Kakashi ending the series without a romantic partner, yet so many authors treat that as a fate worse than death. There's more life than dating, you know? 

But to loop this back around to the OP's topic:

We can argue about whether or not he ""deserved"" her, but that's not how relationships work. I'm sure we've all seen people date down or date up or date people they never should have dated -- but that's all from an outsider's perspective. Perhaps the girl who is ""out of his league"" gets the kind of patience and emotional support from him that her hot, selfish ex never gave her. Perhaps the person dating another individual who is ""too good for them"" and ""the best you're going to get"" winds up dumping that total sweetheart because they are in a bad place mentally and just can't deal with a relationship right now. 

People are complicated. Relationships are tricky.

I‚Äôm pretty sure you can buy a small circuit board which comes pre-setup to do deauth, it‚Äôs something I would assign a really low barrier to entry. 

I used to send those out in order to force devices to reconnect to a wpa2 network so I could grab the handshake. Back when ATT used a 10 digit number as the default password. Got me some pretty quick free internet from the neighbors in highschool.

We are happy to announce that No Repost November was enough of a success that we will now start the new year repost-free.

Your answers on the Repost Survey showed that the [majority of you don't like reposts just as much as we don't](https://i.imgur.com/AiAIvlK.png). While many were for simply extending our repost policy to greater than 3 months, [with almost 3/4 supporting that](https://i.imgur.com/FHZWPXN.jpg), the more interesting and overall popular option was the selection of [""Reposts are banned most of the time but allowed on certain days of the week/month""](https://i.imgur.com/BvLLpGE.jpg). 

Therefore we are only going to allow all reposts one weekend every 3 months so people can catch up on old content during those purge weekends.

Overall, the plan is to have an event weekend every month. This month we'll have another spoiler weekend, which plenty of people have asked for a repeat of. 2020-01-18/19 is the weekend to mark on your calendars for that one, though we'll put up a warning a day beforehand.

If you're just itching to post some reposts, you got to wait until the weekend of the 2020-03-21/22, which will be our first free-for-all repost weekend.

We also have something planned for the weekend in between those, the 2020-02-21/22, but it's a secret what that one is about.

The keen-eyed figured out this would be every 3rd weekend of the month, though you'll get a warning on the Friday beforehand to prepare for them.

---

TL;DR: **Reposts are now banned**, regular event weekends incoming.

There was another account of the mother of Chan Yim Lam was killed and the one who appeared on TV asking for the protestors to leave them alone is a fake mum...I wanted more facts and they showed me a photo of 'supposedly' being her dead body dumped next to another pile of trash. 
Im like that doesnt really add up - like surely her mum would have friends and other family members - this would be easy to investigate to seek evidence for these mysterious missing people than just one blurrly photo.",1577836836

"SSBM","t5_2so9j","&gt; Except for the fact that almost all of leffens wins are from before zain was top 10

Except that's literally not true. Zain and Leffen only played twice in both 2018 and 2019‚Äì each winning once per year. Zain upset Leffen once in 2017 and Leffen has beaten him once before that.

&gt; He‚Äôs never dropped a single set to either fiction or ibdw, and he‚Äôs dropped a single set out of almost 20 to sfat.

I will concede that point. Although Fiction had an INCREDIBLY close game 5 last stock match at Genesis (which he was robbed of imo).

&gt; ‚ÄúZains just that consistent‚Äù isn‚Äôt a counter argument either.

It is absolutely an argument. Zain made Top 8 at all 17 tournaments he went to except for Genesis. Those are undeniably consistent results. Even Mango praises Zain on stream for his consistency all the time.

&gt; has lost multiple sets to lower ranked players like Johnny, n0ne, wizzy, m2k, Swedish delight

Actually, Zain has *never* lost to N0ne before so idk where you got that from. He didn't lose to Swedish this entire year (and is up 9-1 lifetime record). Zain traded sets with S2J this year. If you wanna pretend that Wizzy (who is ranked above Zain) and fucking Mew2King are bad losses then I don't know what to tell you. Zain is constantly attending tournaments so of course more people are going to upset him. Even his worst loss this year is ranked higher than Hbox's worst loss.",1577836836

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Circumcision was an Jewish requirement (overwhelmingly). Circumcision is not required for Christians of any stripe, but you can't believe how many times I've heard it used as an excuse by Christians. Only Jews should be continuing this practice, and they make up such a small percentage of people in the US. 

I don't even know the justification used by non-religious couples. There's no medical benefits to circumcision. Not that I've heard of.",1577836838

Happy New Year from the Yuri Service Provider.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","I‚Äôm the middle child of two brothers, all a year apart. Growing up and to this day, my older brother liked to buy and obsessively play the hottest &amp; latest game on any console he owned. I think I never got into video games because, even though I was really mesmerized and interested in trying and playing with him and join the cheering crowd, I was never really given a chance. There‚Äôs a pride in little boys, knowing video games are ‚Äúmeant‚Äù for them. So looking back, I noticed when they (bless their generous hearts) let me hold the controller, they became immediately hesitant, impatient, skeptical, patronizing, and even yelled at me a lot when I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do in the games. So naturally, growing up I stayed away but to this day, I‚Äôm reminded I would‚Äôve LOVED to have grown up invested in video games because it leads to strategy, problem solving, team work, and even an interest in coding which is all relevant in today‚Äôs tech sector which is why it‚Äôs important to address that there is, really no SAFE space for women in the video game/fantasy/tech world because boys grew up thinking it was meant for themselves. Women dominated the tech &amp;  coding in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, but I think unless we (By we I mean men because women do all the labor in this department) work to address misogyny embedded in men, even (especially) business men, then the working sect in tech and video games will always hinder women from feeling confident and safe in shared community interests(such as video games) and in their careers (the growing tech industry) from a young age to an adult.",1577836840

"Scotch","t5_2qq65","Happy New Year‚Äôs Eve, Scotchit! This is another dram poured for me by my good buddy u/smoked_herring. Thanks dude!

I‚Äôve decided to take it upon myself to write the last r/scotch review of the decade, for no particular reason. Also for no particular reason, I‚Äôve picked this Ben Nevis to be the lucky review. I‚Äôve never reviewed a Ben Nevis, not for lack of trying. This one is a Kensington Wine Market exclusive. 

***

**Ben Nevis 22 1996 Single Malts of Scotland** Highland single malt. 53.4% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.

**Local Price:** Not available in Ontario. $180 CAD at Kensington Wine Market in Alberta.

**Barrels:** Distilled October 21 1996, bottled May 5 2019 at 22 years of age. Matured in cask #1659, a sherry butt. Bottled at cask strength, yielding 440 bottles total.

**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Rested about 15 minutes.

***

**Nose:** Spicy and intense. Various fresh-baked brown breads, some sourdough too. Very dusty, lots of dried earth flavours, with plenty of old musty basement and yeast. Chocolate ganache, dried herbs, fennel, caraway, cinnamon, candied nuts, and toffee. Intense fruit too: blood orange, macerated strawberries, sweet cantaloupe, banana, figs, raisins, and dried apricots. 

**Palate:** Medium texture, slightly oily. Sweet yeast, salted butter, caramel, cherries, and tropical fruit up front. Fragrant tea and sourdough next, along with earth, hay, salted nuts, and rich barley. Then it gets earthy: fragrant oak, tobacco and more exotic teas on the back end. Lots of tea, actually. Black pepper and honey towards the back.

**Finish:** Subtle, but fairly long. Tart citrus and plums fade to various fragrant teas, nectarine, manuka honey, brown sugar, barley, black licorice, pear, French toast, coffee, and gentle cinnamon. Lingering tea, with salt and pepper.

***

**Notes:** Pretty nice, all in all. There‚Äôs plenty of that yeasty character that Ben Nevis is known for. That fermented tea note throughout is interesting and quite nice. I think it‚Äôs not quite jiving with me as much as I expected it to. It‚Äôs quite good and interesting, but maybe just not my kind of profile. 

**Final score:  82/100**

***

**Rating Scale:**

0-49: Blech.

50-59: Save it for mixing. Or chugging.

60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.

70-74: Meh. It‚Äôs definitely drinkable, but can do better.

75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.

80-84: Really quite good. Well above average.

85-89: Excellent, a standout malt.

90-94: Personal favourite.

95-100: Mythical. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever taste a whisky this good.

"ShitPostCrusaders","t5_3f7q5","WAIT. A level 33 Diavolo is in speed tie with a level 44 charizard.
Based on the calculations, Diavolo will have a speed between 147 and 83.
Even tho the gap is huge, the fact that diavolo is 11 levels under charizard makes him a pretty fast pokemon.
His base speed stats must be around 130/135 making him the 14th fastest pokemon out of 800+

Based on this shitpost that I now count as canon, we can calculate the speed of all the JoJo characters.
From Diavolo to all the cast of Vento Aureo.
Fron Giorno we can calculate Koichi from episode 1.
From him all of part 4 and Jotaro.
From Jotaro the part 3 cast and villains.
Also fron Jotaro, all of part 6 cast.

And soon we'll know the speed stat to A C H I E V E   H E A V E N",1577836840

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Not necessarily, but AFAIK the Big 12 is currently winless against P5 teams with a winning record (0-5 last I checked but it's been a minute). We've kind of assumed the Big 12 isn't that bad because historically they're the ~3rd best conference, but nothing this season has shown that they aren't actually just dreadful. 

And to be perfectly honest, I'm not convinced that LSU-OU game wasn't an indictment of the big 12. It would be one thing if the game looked like LSU-UGA, but it didn't. OU looked like they were A&amp;M level at best, and this is the same OU team that beat unanimous #2 in the Big 12 Baylor twice. Not to mention that LSU spent two weeks looking at film, decided that OU was a pretty bad team (see Patrick Queen's comments/the tweet that said staff considered OU to be the 5th best team they've played pregame), and then the game showed they were kind of right.

And while this in particular is an OU thing and not a Big 12 thing, despite all the love Grinch has gotten, his gameplan vs LSU was pathetic. You had two weeks to gameplan, and the best you could come up with was try to limit Chase and give the slot receiver a 7 yard cushion pre snap? Really? Did you even watch 2019 LSU film?",1577836841

To me it is absolute common sense to ban private fireworks and restrict it to public displays; the arguments are many and include the noise and terrified pets, as you mentioned, but more importantly imo the vast number of amputations and disfigurements as a result of improper handling of fireworks. We have a plastic surgeon in my family and the amount of amputated fingers he sees this time of year is absurd and completely avoidable, not to mention the people who lose eyes and go blind. 

The debate in the Netherlands is ongoing, as it seems to be in the UK, but in my experience it tends to be quite a bit more nuanced than the comments I'm reading here.",1577836841

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

Thanks for understanding.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","I spent three years in Germany courtesy of the US Army, and drove over 100,000 km. Back then (1986-89) there were no speed limits on the Autobahn. When I visited in 2001, there were still a few stretches without speed limits, but they were the exception. I did notice that in 1986-89 the normal speed was around 130 km/h (80 mph) but by 2001 the normal speed was more like 150 km/h (95 mph) in the unrestricted parts. Always, though, no matter what speed you are going, you stay in the right lane unless you are overtaking a slower car, then move straight back into the right lane. And before you move into the left lane, you look FAR back to see if someone is coming up behind at 260 km/h (160 mph) because that happens.

But Autobahn etiquette is not the only place that Germans drive properly by the rules. In the city you can depend on everyone signalling every move, from leaving a parallel parking place on the street to changing lanes.  Your car has these wonderful devices to warn everyone what you are about to do. Use them!",1577836849

  Words were a Seelie‚Äôs specialty - their magic relied on the manipulation of it, and the ways it could play tricks on the mind. With a bit of stealth and luck, she overheard the offer given to Saka Mummana, and later flew up to him. 

  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame they wouldn‚Äôt pick multiple tutors, I‚Äôd like to learn a thing or two about your magic myself. Oh, but that depends if you stay. It‚Äôs an awful far flight to your lands.‚Äù 

  Privately, when she had a chance to escape prying eyes, she flew off to find a secluded she had made sure no one, sage or servant, had gone near or seen in the time she was there while the council deliberated. [if one exists]. 

  The hardest part would be acquiring... materials, but thankfully other seelie just outside the city donated what they could and helped her make a small 8inch wide portal within the castle. With Vim‚Äôs illusionary magic, it was easy enough to sneak a few faeries and supplies through, and then put a little spell around the portal. They really did underestimate the power of enchantments.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

Fluoride rinses give me rashes around my face, intentionally fluoridated water makes me feel sick and almost too dizzy to Since it‚Äôs such a strange thing to react to, it took a long time to figure out what was happening (weekly fluoride rinses) and I think it permanently messed me up. Most of my chronic health problems date back to that year in elementary school. 


Now I live in an area without fluoridated water. It took until I was taking rinses regularly for it to be a problem (and in some way, it seemed to make it a problem?) If I was just born in a city and drank tap water, I would be substantially more disabled than I already am. I already struggle a lot with my illness‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone 


Basically‚Ä¶flouride is medication and medication has unintended reactions in different people. It‚Äôs downright irresponsible to mass medicate without monitoring for negative reactions. People must be able to make informed decisions about what they put in their body. I think all of you can see that with vaccines/the immunocompromised or allergic. I just wish it didn‚Äôt sound like a conspiracy theory when you speak out about flouride.",1577836849

"JUSTNOMIL","t5_377ps","I vote option 1: ignore it. Not your circus, not your monkeys.

But the trick to dropping the rope is not just leaving MIL as DH‚Äôs responsibility, but also *not caring* if MIL gets upset. It was DH‚Äôs choice and responsibility, so he‚Äôs the one who has to deal with fallout. For the baptism example you gave, dumping MIL‚Äôs anger back on DH is responding to any of her complaints with ‚ÄúIt was DH‚Äôs responsibility to coordinate with you.‚Äù The same goes for this trip: if she complains, dump it on DH then end the call or walk away.

This also means that you drop questioning DH‚Äôs choices. If he‚Äôd rather experience a delayed-but-bigger blow-up from MIL when she realizes you‚Äôre not staying with her instead of dealing with her whining by telling her up front so she couldn‚Äôt assume, that‚Äôs his choice. Maybe he‚Äôd rather deal with an hour of yelling than months of whining.

If MIL doesn‚Äôt like how DH communicates with her (or fails to), it‚Äôs her fault for not teaching him differently when raising him. **It‚Äôs not your problem.** Stop tying yourself in knots trying to streamline their relationship.

**Removal Reason:** Your account is new on Reddit.  We appreciate your desire to participate in the Pro Tools reddit community however, due to the high percentage of SPAM being submitted by new account holders and posts with rule violations by reddit newcomers, it has become necessary to remove all posts from brand new accounts as a preventative measure. This is a common practice on reddit. 

**You may not request an appeal if** your account is less than a week old, the post contains a link, or if the post contains and image or text copy paste from your own blog.  Also, do not attempt to appeal based on the age or existence of other reddit accounts you may have.  The age of any other Reddit accounts is not a factor since the age rule is based on a per-account basis.   

**What you can do if you are not a spammer** - You can send a kindly worded message to the subreddit moderators for an appeal EXCEPT for cases where 1) the posts contains links or 2) the post is from an account less than one week old.  If your account is less than a week old, you may still participate in the comments while your account ages and you learn the ropes of reddit.

Another element of the unnecessary Breakpoint hate is that everyone has *their* level of expectations. It‚Äôs impossible for anyone to make a Sequel that pleases everyones‚Äô expectations.

As I‚Äôve said over and over again (check my post history and you‚Äôll see this repeated a LOT) I genuinely and sincerely hope Breakpoint gets the improvement treatment that Wildlands got.

And yeah, I've talked with people about how committing to transition is kind of scary because I'm being more transparent about who I am, but it makes me more vulnerable to hate. But for the first time in my life I feel like I'm strong enough to be me and not care about what other people say. They don't know how hard my life has been and they probably couldn't handle being me, so why should I let what they say or think bother me? But thanks for your support! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",1577836855

Here's to 2019, which was a year of so many records and firsts and excitement; and here's to 2020, may it be full of as much love and laughter and light as last year, more goals and more records and more fun!

And if your 2019 sucked, I hope your 2020 gets better. If it was a rollercoaster of ups and downs, I hope it's more of a leisurely mountain climb next year, where you reach a peaceful meadow plateau and live there, or continue to climb for higher grounds. And if you had a great 2019, I hope your 2020 is even better.

Remember: **things never change unless you change them**; dark moments will pass; and if you do resolutions, make small, attainable goals in order to accomplish them&amp;larger general resolutions that you can work on slowly (going to the gym every day is easily broken, but eating a healthy meal a day and/or only taking the stairs is easier! Set goals you know you can accomplish, rather than lofty goals that are harder to accomplish and will leave you feeling like you failed lol).

 It sounds like your starting out so you'll also benefit from moving thru the areas quickly. You can over power your rifles muzzle ammo body and grip for extra damage. If you spend the coin to do that to levels 11-11-10-10. You'll be able to do the 3 of the special ops for the next area and most of the primary ops with that rifle. 

Also don't waste money getting shotguns and AR's unless your trying to use one for world ops. Really I would say wait until tier 11 or 12 so you can be good for platinum world ops. You should be okay using your sniper for anything lower than platinum. 

With the diamonds from world ops you should get some gear.

Images, screenshots, or gifs uploaded through the Reddit app or the reddit website are not allowed; as such, your post has been removed.  We only allow images as part of a discussion post, or if hosted on a portfolio site; gameplay gifs must be hosted on another website and that link shared to reddit.

## How do I submit images or screenshots?

You may submit your post as a [discussion (self) post](/r/Overwatch/submit?selftext=true) with some context - more than just a single line of text - speaking about the image. If you're submitting fanart, you may link directly to a DeviantArt page, ArtStation portfolio, blog, etc.  

Imgur posts are automatically removed, even if its a GIFV, as we're not able to detect which type it is.

## How do I submit a gameplay highlight?

You may submit your gameplay highlight by uploading it to a GIF/video sharing website and submitting the link to /r/Overwatch. We do not support uploading gameplay highlights directly through the Reddit app/website at this time.

[Please see the subreddit rules for more information.](/r/Overwatch/wiki/rules) Thanks!

Like I said.

I agree with you that killing human beings is wrong; the core of this debate though is when something becomes\* human. I respect your opinions on this matter, and simply acknowledge we have different beliefs on this.

&gt;Yes, I'm certainly aware of basic biological fact, see my first point.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, fully aware of how these things play out. Have been pregnant twice.  
&gt;  
&gt;I used to be pro choice, I know how the other side operates already lol

By your language it seems that you pride yourself on knowing a lot. However, the number of times you've been pregnant does not make you an expert on the pregnancy experiences of the entire female collective, nor embryonic/developmental pathology; nor does once being pro-choice make you an expert on the thoughts/arguments of groups of people.",1577836858
"AskTruFemcels","t5_p73kq","&gt;a woman only has to be busted in one way and that is looks.

Exactly. That is just 1 thing. One single thing, while women have whole lists or doos an donts. Like people tell men to lower their standards. ***There woudlnt be any more standards if this last thing went away***.

&gt; That is because most men (and apparently you included) consider looks first and foremost 

Oh come on, fakeup exists for a reason.

&gt; I don't see how you don't see that there are women that fall below the standard and are thus not able to get dates 

Because evolution literealy made men to be attracted to most women. meaning in a large enough group of men (idk a 1000 should be enough) there should be, at least, 1 instance of ever girl being attractive to at least 1 guy. I mean most women would be attractive to most men but even when looking at the very extreme left on the Gaussian curve, there should be at least 1 guy attracted to said girl.

&gt; Notice here I said ""dates"" and not that other four letter d word 

So wait, you can still get men to have sex with you, willingly, out of attraction. Men would kill for this. And yet you still call yourself a femcel. What a joke.

&gt; I think most people would agree that because of men's higher sex drive,  they will have sex with lots of different women, even women that they  are not attracted to if it is just sex, but, they will not date or have  relationships with those women. 

Well its true, but hey, its something. I cant even imagine being able to get casual sex from random girls and yet girls do it like its no biggie. The fact that you want dates and arent even hungry for basic attraction and sex is proof of how all women here have a huge blindspot. They are blind to the fact that, unlike most men, they are able to get sex with a willing partner whenever they want.

Come on, i see you are smart, the way you wrote your comment, surely you can understand what i said here.

&gt; I will disagree with you heavily here. In my view, women have way more standards to live up to than men...  

Arent the men the ones doing the competing. A woman can afford to just be a wall flower and guys will still want her. But he. He has to carry the world on his shoulders. Just look at the most powerful men on the planet. They are all the way they are because evolution designed them to pursue power. Because women only want powerful men. Like its so ingrained in their psyche they dont even question it. They just like the feeling of being powerful, but they dont dig further to realize that, they are no different than a puppet on a string.

&gt; . You also came to a sub of women who admittedly have dating problems and or have never dated  

Hold your horses. Wait you said that: "" Notice here I said ""dates"" and not that other four letter d word ""

Something here doesnt add up. I would like you to explain this more.

&gt; That is, you expected us to treat you better than you treated us 

This is actually a very good argument, i might start using it. Good job.

&gt; You expected us to care about your and other I suppose less-dating  fortunate men problems while telling us that our problems are nothing  and just made up 

Well if there are more hopeless and desperate men (there are) than women, doesnt that make it an impossibility that a woman just cant find a guy?",1577836858

And I'll say what I've already said before in this thread and elsewhere. I *don't* think art should be removed. But I also don't think it should be allowed as standalone posts. Because as it is, it encourages attention-seeking and shallow involvement. Above all, its overuse contributes to the perception of tulpas as being only childish make-believe.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","And btw, Teneriffe and Eastern Airlines Flight 401 are excellent examples of  the former mindset of the industry. One thing I picked up...I saw this mentioned, was airlines use to be hostile to the NTSB. Overly burdensome regulations they thought, something of that nature, beyond the tragic loss of human lives, flight disasters are bad for business, look at the predicament Boeing is in today with the 737 MAX, one such disaster (and several.prior safety violations in favor of cutting costs) put Valujet under with the Florida Everglades crash in 1995. That said, the two disasters I mentioned, basicslly the captain was the brains of the entire operation, the crew acted as unthinking robots carrying out orders. Eastern Airlines Flight 401 and Teneriffe are examples of this dangerous way to operate airplanes and United Airlines Flight 232 is easily touted as a great example of successful changes in the industry in favor of excellent CRM and a divorce from the previous mindset in the industry. 

United Airlines Flight 232's CRM was so above and beyond what might be expected to the point that a First Class passenger with several thousand hours as a DC-10 trainer in simulators was the one crewing the thrust controls for the engines, he saved A LOT of lives that day. 

Ideally under most scenarios, no one ever survives a total loss of hydraulic fluid in the flight controls. Japan Airlines Flight 123 only had 4 survivors out over 500 crew and passengers (they assumed they all died and heavily delayed the recovery under the assumption it was a total loss, several injured passengers could have been saved, but died of hypothermia, the US Marine Corp equipped with helicopters offered to help but were fatally told to stand down by Japanese authorities). Turkish Airlines Flight 981 with also a DC-10 would be another example of what I'm talking about.



That's why United Airlines Flight 232 is cited as a ""successful disaster"" because they had far more survivors than what would ordinarily be expected given the circumstances, and IMO one of the most interesting flight disasters to study.",1577836859

I'm not going to pick it up but I don't need to shut people down for having hobbies and interests that are different than mine.

Of course, that's not even the real issue.  The real issue is that their fragile egos respond to being faced by someone who is doing what they know or believe they should be doing for their own health too and, instead of being confident in their choices and being a bit more live and let live about it they feel the need to shut down the talk that hurts their fee-fees and hits on their own insecurities.

I would still prefer Warren. She's got the progressive reputation, but the establishment connections and stability.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Let me say that you make a great point. 

Christians love to say that atheists get their morality from Christianity but I firmly believe it's the other way around. Christians indeed derive their morality from a humanist/secular source. If we abided by the Bible as it is exactly written we'd be living in a hellish society. A place where slavery would still be legal and woman's rights would be a joke. A place where many of the freedoms of the modern day would be non existent. Of course this isn't the case because our moral ideals have evolved past the Bible but Christians won't acknowledge this because it would discredit the core of their belief system. 

Think about it, does the Bible ever denounce slavery? No, it even encourages it. By the end of the Bible, there's no indication that having slaves is any way illegal/sin. So, that means that when people opposed slavery in America, we really can't say that this came from some kind of biblical source of morality, since the Bible itself was a proponent of slavery. So where else did it comes from? A humanistic consideration for ones fellow man. Most Christians are so deep in their faith they don't understand this. Your moral intuitions about slavery, treatment of women, etc cannnot possibly come from the Bible itself if the Bible actually supported these things. It has to come from a place outside the Bible. But alas, Christians will find every excuse in the book to explain why God ordering the slaughter of babies , ordaining slavery, and making women second class beings was A ok, but im sure most deep down have severe issues with it.",1577836862

"witcher","t5_2sebi","Hey , so to your first question . Witcher are there to decide who is evil and who is good . But there is a rumor towards witchers that they can't feel any emotions after their Mutation and they shouldn't be able to decide between good and bad. In the books witchers feelings are more filed down and really sometimes not there ( thats also why witchers don't feel ashamed or anything when they take use of the the law of suprise and steal a child) . The more the story progresses we know that witchers can feel emotions , they're just not ""programmed"" to do so and are also treated the same way by normal people. Thats also why geralts light hearted side shows itself a little bit later in the books after his adventures with ciri , yennefer etc. and in the games he comes over as the exact opposite because he "" came over "" his old self but other witchers still feel cold hearted because they havent had the opportuntity to enlarge their feelings

And that is also the reason of the storming of kear morhen. Tho not many information is given in the games AND the books we can for sure say that in the cliff under the bridge of kear morhen there is one big pile of bones and skulls of those who fall and there are more than the bridge one thats why it isn't really measurable how many people invaded kear morhen but it was way more than 200. The ones who died on the witchers side were all of the people who know how to handle the mutations thats also why there cant be any mutations held anymore in kear morhen.as far as i know the only survivors who stayed in kear morhen were vesemir and his students that being geralt lamber eskel so not everybody died most of them went away and never came back for Winter",1577836862

&gt;Bourbon vs. Rye ‚Äì Weller special reserve, Corner Creek, I.W. Harper 15 years, Willett Family reserve rye barrel strength , Pikesville Rye, Peerless barrel strength Rye 107.6 proof

When I had it, it was a little different, although the only one I remember is the closing ""mystery whiskey,"" which stumped us all. Turned out to be Hudson Baby Bourbon -- too smooth for us to have guessed it was a bourbon. But maybe our palates just aren't there.

More recently, I had:

"santacruz","t5_2qonf","I like the parks up the coast for some great longer hikes with much fewer people than you'll find in Wilder or Fall Creek.   (At both Gazos Creek and Pescadero Creek, I've often done 10 miles and only passed one or two parties.  Purisma is more crowded. ) There are lots of trail combinations where you can put together hikes of 5-10-15 miles as you like.  A few favorites:

Purisma Creek Redwoods - Up the coast, it's located just below Half Moon Bay. There are excellent trails there, with all the uphill you could want, and some great views as a reward.  My favorite loop is up Purisma Creek Trail to Craig Britton Trail to North Ridge Trail at the summit; then come down via Harkins or Whitmore Gulch.  Another nice hike  and very steep, is to head up Purisma Creek Trail one mile, then turn right and take Borden Hatch Mill Trail.  At the top of Borden Hatch Mill, you can then go right for an out-and back leg on Bald Knob Trail, or you can go left, down Grabtown Gulch, and reunite with Purisma Creek Trail.[https://www.openspace.org/preserves/purisima-creek-redwoods](https://www.openspace.org/preserves/purisima-creek-redwoods)

Gazos Creek - Up the coast 24 miles, to the Hwy. 1 Brewing Co. Turn right just after the brewery and take the road back until it dead ends at the locked gate (about 4 miles?).  Park and head up the fire road/trail that parallels the creek. The first two miles are straight up hill, but then you hit the ridge and it flattens out.  At the top, you have choices of going right to Sandy Point overlook (highly recommended), or left down into Big Basin.[https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7026128/gazos-creek-road](https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7026128/gazos-creek-road)

Pescadero Creek Park - Up the coast, turn right towards Pescadero, continue past town for another 5 miles or so and you'll be there.  (This entrance is a smaller, unstaffed one called Hoffman Creek Trailhead, so keep your eyes peeled.  It's a right turn about a 1/2 mile after you've passed  Dearborn Park campgrounds).   Sooo many trails and combinations that I can't even list them all.[https://parks.smcgov.org/pescadero-creek-park](https://parks.smcgov.org/pescadero-creek-park)",1577836862

"TheArcana","t5_4h1lf","From my personal experience, I've been a tarot reader for roughly 12 years. I recently bought The Arcana deck, and just did my first full celtic cross reading with it two days ago. I had to kind of squint and ""hrm"" a little bit because I haven't studied anything about it, (not to mention it doesn't come with a guidebook) and the major arcana aren't labeled. But I also know what order the major arcana comes in so I just kinda, went off the roman numerals.

Anywho, its a delightful deck, but there would be a bit of a learning curve if it was your first. I don't think you should let that stop you if you really feel connected to it though, learning your first deck takes a long time anyway. Whats a couple of extra steps and a little more time? Besides, if you're playing The Arcana daily, you'll passively learn about it anyway. Have fun!",1577836863

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Ok so while this is obviously not true you have to understand the historical context as it relates to Russia.

Ignore the Nazis.

Poland was frequently part of Russia over the previous 500 years. Poland declaring independence, losing wars to either Austria, Prussia, Russia or Sweden was a common occurrence. To the Russians it was a headache whenever Poland started agitating. The Romanoffs also governed Poland more liberally than they did Russia (with a constitutional monarchy as opposed to the absolute monarchy in Russia).

Germany offering to split Poland was a  reasonable compromise to the USSR. More buffer between them and the west to set up a client state. The US has done this constantly in the western hemisphere over the past two centuries.

It it however unreasonable to blame the war in Russia. Hitler enacted the Schlifen plan which is what actually started the war. Before that everyone was just appeasing Hitler. And if you want to pick nits the Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931 which was the first conflict in the war.",1577836863
"HadToHurt","t5_37bug","Okay.. so CrossFit coaches that have done Olympic lifting can‚Äôt teach the same way that were taught to prevent harm when going at heavy loads (why I said PVC pipe). small changes are done in Olympic weightlifting too.. that‚Äôs like saying the States, Russians, and the Chinese all lift the same and all have the same lifting program and techniques on how to teach it..

Any type of lifting/movement/running puts stress and strain on a muscle that‚Äôs that point to training it to grow bigger/stronger/quicker! So what makes an Olympic lift any different when done for 10 reps with good form? You‚Äôre basically saying that after 3-5 reps of an Olympic lift you can no longer have good form to perform a lift.. 
CrossFit is literally training so that even at fatigue you have the metabolic conditioning to hold good form during any lift.. not just olympic lifts.
CrossFit isn‚Äôt balls to the wall forget all you ever know about lifting just go as fast as you can.. efficiency is what‚Äôs being taught.. how fast can you move at this weight.. efficiently (good form).

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","It ultimately depends on your game. If you have a cohesive idea, that idea probably has an experiential focus. In other words your game is aiming to illicit some sort of experience. Try to find the feature(s) that will let you prototype that experience and see if it works, and work on that feature(s) first.

If you're making a strategy game, your experiential focus is going to be one of interesting decisionmaking, so maybe design a gameplay loop on paper using sketches or paper cutouts.

If you're working on a roguelike with a focus on exploration, perhaps you'd want to jump into code first, and see if you can create interesting levels using layers of Perlin noise.

Maybe you're making a physics-heavy golfing game, and the best way to test out ideas would be to throw around a ping-pong ball and see if you can get it to land in a cup. You can start level-designing IRL by throwing together weird contraptions and obstacles. Maybe get a toddler to help you out and see if they're having fun.

If it's a minimalist tonal piece, try creating an environment first. Try walking around using a stock camera and see if it makes you feel anything. Can you imagine a story here? What does the soundtrack to this place sound like?

There's so many ways to start. Sometimes overthinking it is the biggest point of paralysis. Try just jumping in! There's a good chance you'll get halfway through coding a platforming system and then decide ""I think I need a level for this thing to play around in so I can test this jumping code.""

It may be a Christian concept but it's essentially the same as ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" because they're humans like us. I don't agree with the concept of war because there should always be another way to avoid conflict instead of inciting it. 

I never said I agreed with the world policing the US does because that's what the UN is for, it's not our place to say what other countries do. Honestly, the last time our military did something that was right overseas was helping the Soviets, the French and others defeat Nazi Germany and help shut down Concentration Camps. We had no reason to be in Vietnam, we had no reason to be in Iraq and Afghanistan, they were useless conflicts that only served to kill innocent civilians and our troops to either ""stop communism"" or try and claim Saudi oil for ourselves.

Yknow, the part where I said, ""if you dont want to go vegan, dont"".  that was to ward off the exact type of reaction you still managed to arrogantly have.  

Plant based diets would help save the rainforest. They wont save it on their own, palm oil and cutting down trees for wood and whatever other problems are also problems..but More crop farm land is being used to feed livestock than crops are being produced to feed humans.   We're cutting down forests to install farms.  Farms we dont NEED.   You can still eat meat, and i daresay enjoy it MORE if you eat less of it.  But less is more is a concept capitalistic grown minds really have trouble with, dont we.  its only after overeating, overdosing, being addicts, do we (temporarily) realize that too much isn't a good thing, but then we go out and repeat our mistakes again.  Our ancestors didn't feast on meat every day.   And there also weren't 7 billion of them on this globe.   But ""we do because we can"" is a nice way to condone the destruction of our species, and its what most people in the modern world live by. 

The 1950s education in modern western society and the still prevalent ""meat is the center of the diet"", ""meat makes a man"" is propoganda that I reckon you and many others bought into, and its propoganda is a lot more harmful than eating less meat, which is what im espousing.   the irony is that science has shown that meat actually reduces manliness in erection size and hardness.

&gt;Most likely the issue is obesity from consuming too many calories and tons of sugar.

""most likely"" isn't very scientific.   science has shown that our endothelium is affected negatively by animal products.   plant products have the opposite affect, allowing for more blood flow and expansion.",1577836866

I've constructed what I call a staple binder, now hear me out:

I keep two decks actively built up, and everything else goes in the binder.

-staples are organized by type syncro,xyz,spell, trap etc.

-Each deck has its core cards on 2-3 pages if it isn't a staple

This way cards are secured and safe in q binder, so I only have to track two deck boxes and a binder!
 If you wanna play a deck everything is there and it only takes 10-15 minutes to swap cards out! 

(If you for some reason have a ton of one case you can dedicate it to one card type, I for example use white eclipse cases for all of my extra deck cards to make transitioning cards over much quicker.)

"Android","t5_2qlqh","As much as I loved Inbox, it was extremely opinionated about how you work (which put a lot of people off), and was missing more than half of the Gmail features. And as we've seen with dropping Inbox, there was zero chance they would add all those features to Inbox before dropping Gmail.

Just a few:

* Pins aren't the same as stars, and you can choose whether stars show up separately in your inbox or not.
* Gmail has an Outlook-like paned view where you have the list of conversations on the left and the contents on the right.
* Gmail can format your email as plain text, which is required for some mailing lists... yet the mobile app didn't (for awhile) have formatting tools. So you were in this ironic situation where you couldn't so much as make things *italic,* but Inbox would still send it as HTML.
* Gmail's offline mode on desktop has always been pretty dodgy, but Inbox never even tried. And on mobile, you can tell the Gmail app how much mail to sync.

So it makes sense porting Inbox's best ideas to the more flexible client. It's just increasingly frustrating that they never bothered to port Inbox's actual best idea.",1577836867

Then I sort by kudos or comments, set to complete works usually, and optionally add a ratings filter. I use exclusions pretty liberally, usually pairings I'm not interested in seeing. Another good way, once you find an author you like, is to look at their other works or their bookmarks. 

It might help to post what sort of stuff you're interested in so that people can get you started with recs! I can help if you're interested in Sequel or Prequel stuff, mostly, since that's what I've bookmarked.",1577836867

It would have been great if they sought to remove all the small barriers where possible, which means making it digital copy in the box OR allowing a digital copy license alongside the cart.

Is that why all this don't matter a shit when you go in to multiple targets and wonder why you got blown up???   
Or when they enemy pick Darius/Jax/Garen etc etc and when your spells hit them their HP bars fall as if a flower has hit a stone because they are too god damn tanky but also have enough damage???  


Rhetorical question...  


Unless you want to be a support-tank which, is like 0.0000000001% of Diana players assuming they exist???  


""The difference will be even bigger if u don't instantly die and get to use the shield multiple times in a fight. Which will be the case if u  manage to eliminate the damage threat at the start if the fight (if u  can't delete an ADC u just suck, not that Diana needs buffs). ""  


"" ROA, Mercs, Nashors, Spirit Visage, Randuins Omen, Dead man's plate. ""  


But what does Diana have to sacrifice to do that? Pretty much everything.  


Is she even close to what bruisers do? Nope! Because bruisers either survive and do a good amount of damage while doing both in a good balance of both and both for them is significant while for her, damage is still the primary goal, more than surviving due to her numbers and her kit.

There won't be any difference because you won't have damage to do anything of significant importance, even most tanks like Orn will have more damage than you, wtf am i reading?

\+ , all this is assuming that, when you dive the enemy team and they dump pretty much everything on you, your team will have the brains to respond in time before their CDs are up again or at least the most significant ones for them/dangerous for you, otherwise you will be left with no CDs, dealt no more significant damage than a fart, and be inside of the enemy team, exposed and if so they happened to a DPS you are likely dead even if you have zhonyas which in that case has you standing on a spot, unable to move for 2.5 secs super easy to be targeted by almost anything, or zoned etc etc.  


Is Diana able to tank more damage vs old Diana, with HP-AP items, sure, yes but also not really a lot to be relevant to either the direction of the bruiser nor to the direction of making any strong use of it to give you the sense that you can go with this and be successful at least not when all other bruisers beat your face on the ground for breakfast.",1577836868

"ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM","t5_3o0h8","&gt; Many of these things are simply conservative values.

Because conservatism and fascism are connected.

&gt; The American conservative wing is also filled with anti-large government rhetoric

Rhetoric only. The American conservative movement loves the idea of border control, police presence, militarism, etc. The only thing they mean by ""small government"" is government that doesn't bother *them.*

&gt; Furthermore, the Republican Party is strongly free market and against social programs, things that are also in opposition to fascism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Privatization_and_business_ties

&gt; but to say that one leads to the other is the slippery slope fallacy.

One leads to the other because fascism is capitalism in decay. Capitalism promises the white petty bourgeoisie wealth, power, and sex. During the downturn, it cannot deliver. (After all, who takes the hit when the economy crashes? The poor were always poor, and the rich just hoard their riches.) The ruling class, and the state, in fear that the petty bourgeoisie will abandon their faith in the system, instead redirects the petty bourgeoisie to some other ""evil"" influence (Jews, immigrants, whatever the case) and promises that if you maintain faith in the state, and give us absolute loyalty and power, we'll fix it for you.

Because it is literally impossible to prevent. People manipulating markets is a part of economics. It is as well in the real world and is perfectly legal when done a lot of different ways.

I'm sorry but you must be a kid if you somehow think we can have an economy without some people trying to get more out of it. What do you propose in actually concrete details that could combat this? Think super detailed without general statements like ""GGG should prevent it"".

"DebateCommunism","t5_2vkao","I've found my opinions generally aren't welcome in this sub, but here I'll try.

First off, it's difficult to compare degrees and education institutions from country to country. In the US, student loans are given out like candy. You put a pair of glasses on a dog and he would be able to get a student loan. The reason it's so easy is because the US government backs the value of these loans (and also profits off of them, but that's another issue) such that they are not forgivable via bankruptcy.

What does this mean for the education system? It means there's no built-in incentive for lenders to verify the degree of the borrower. In a functioning market system, the lender would be on the hook to make sure the borrower followed a career path that would create enough value to pay the loan back. You'd go into a loan office and say ""I want to get an art history degree!"" and they'd say ""Great! Here are the four schools you can go to with cheap enough tuition to pay back the loan with the average salary of a person with an art history degree! Pick one of these schools or pick another degree!""

Essentially, our government is incentivizing poor decision making by tampering with the market. This is one of the mains reasons you have so many people with ""useless"" degrees in the US. No offense to anyone here, but 18 year olds are pretty stupid. I was a moron when I was 18. I can't imagine understanding the magnitude of the decision to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt when I was that age, yet that's the position we put our kids into via following capital.

Now, let's move on to a non-market system. One of the core tenets of socialism/communism is the self-management of workplaces and social institutions. Imagine you go to a school in The Socialist Peoples Republic of Arstotzka. You sign up for an art history degree. What do they say? ""Sorry, given the economic status of the region, our art history program is backlogged for four years. Pick another degree (or try another school)!""

In other words, in a market system, anybody will sell you anything and not give a shit what you're doing with it. You want an art degree? Sure, get one. What do I care?

In a socialized system, the (dis)incentives that *should* fall onto lenders in a market system are distributed to the institutions that provide those services. Why would a school spend the labor and resources to teach a degree to a student that cannot use the degree when school is done? Instead, art degrees would be metered such that the *supply* of people who have art degrees meet the *demand* of jobs that require art degrees. You're surely free to use the school's library and sit in on art history classes, but the formal education and title that goes with it might be metered, and this decision would likely be made by the teachers and administrators of the school (with likely some input from the public). That said, nobody is stopping you from self-teaching and going directly to a museum and saying ""hey, hire me, I know all this stuff about art.""

So, the idea is why would schools give any degree to any person knowing that the degree will not help the person (or society at large) once the student moves into the workforce? In capitalism, the answer is ""well, because they pay us."" In socialism, the answer is that they likely wouldn't.",1577836871

And Cuba continues to exist, brandishing their red middle finger, at the doorstep of the world's most powerful imperialist nation with relative prosperity.

Revolution is only ever a small, armed group of comrades away. The disciplines of asymmetrical combat and guerrilla warfare have proven viable thousands of times throughout history and will continue to do so, because they nullify all of the points of power that a standing army with limitless resources has.

As far as the situation in Venezuela, well, that has a lot more to do with Maduro's personal incompetence. He is still infinitely preferable to Guaido (who would sell the country out to imperialists in a heartbeat), but he's no Hugo Chavez by any stretch of the imagination.",1577836872

"CommunalShowers","t5_2858fg","Thanks!  I‚Äôve heard similar stories from other swimmers.  Some guys have told me their teams wouldn‚Äôt shower naked but at meets they would join other teams in doing so.  I always found that odd. So you can shower with 20-30 guys you don‚Äôt know well including 7-8 on your own team but at a practice you can‚Äôt shower with those same 7-8 guys?  Seems strange but I‚Äôve heard it a few times.  Also interested to hear about how other guys started wanting to join to be part of the team.  I‚Äôve defiantly experienced this myself.  My friends in Boy Scouts started peer pressuring me to join them in the showers.  This demonstrates an explicit social element to the practice.  Before long more and more guys wanted to join us (without being peer pressured).  Showering with us was almost a status symbol. Younger guys in the 12-14 range  (my friends and I were 15-17)  started following and trying to join.  Initially we tried to stop them (there was a vague 3 year age difference rule we tried to follow), but eventually we gave up shooing them away.  

I saw similar things with other teams.  My brother played hockey and for years growing up he avoided showering.  Something 7 or 8 year olds can get away with.  However by 10-12 the smell combined with the longer commutes for hockey games make this hard to pull off.  My brother was peer pressured to ‚Äújoin the team‚Äù in the showers.  He resisted but at some point he finally did and he loved it.  He was visible proud to have gotten naked with his team.  From then on team showers were a right of passage and an obligation and it probably made the teams closer.  There is something really interesting socially going on.",1577836873

CR has the model 3 ranked #4 out of 18 for reliability (I have a CR subscription), and most importantly, when you look at the reliability breakdown, it has full marks for the all most important components (engine, brakes, drive train etc). It only loses marks for paint, body, and the touchscreen. Obviously not ideal, but these are not areas that will prevent the vehicle from achieving 500k miles.

The model 3 will run 300k to 500k miles easily and with significantly less cost than ANY ICE vehicle. Furthermore, the only thing limiting it from going longer is the battery pack, which Tesla claims they have a new design out next year that will go a million miles. 

Rental car companies find that Tesla's cost per mile is about 6 cents, whereas a Corolla is around 60 cents per mile. 

Electric motors have only a single moving part, whereas ICE engines have hundreds. Its pretty much mechanically impossible for ICE engines to last longer than a brushless electric motor. There isnt a single case of anybody actually wearing out a Tesla motor. They've replaced faulty motors, but never worn one out. The drive trains are rated at a million miles. Economics guarantees the death of the ICE engine, its just more expensive and less reliable period.",1577836873

Thanks for your submission, but unfortunately we've had to remove your post.


The question of ""Is X worth it?"" and ""Should I get game/item X or Y"" get asked a lot. Ultimately, however, you're going to be the best judge of whether the item in question is a good purchase for you.


If you're trying to get a recommendation about what game to buy you should be including sufficient detail as to games you own, the type of or other specifics about the game you are looking for, what you enjoy in games, what turns you off from games, etc. Otherwise, feel free to ask in our [Daily Question Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/search?q=author%3AAutoModerator+Daily+Question+Thread&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day).

No need for a PM tho. Maybe it will help others too. What exactly do you wanna know?

I'm on Manjaro with proprietary Nvidia drivers (works with 430xx, 435xx and now with 440xx). Only thing i needed to do back then, was to enable ""Steam Play"" and select the lastest Proton version in the game settings. You had to change a number in a config file with the old Proton version (""CutsceneMovieOpening 1""), but apparently even that is not needed any more. Just start the game with proton, and it should work out of the box.

ETA: Oh, one thing that IS kind of broken for me, but doesnt affect the game at all: The fps in the steam overlay and in game does not show the real fps somehow. Game shows me 60 fps, while steam shows 120 (capped). Monitor runs at 144 hz tho. im at 110-144 (capped) most of the time. Less in big cities ofc.",1577836875

"Scotch","t5_2qq65","Happy New Year, Scotchit! I‚Äôve taken it upon myself to publish the very first review of the decade, a mere 10 seconds into 2020. According to UTC, at least. It‚Äôs still 7 pm here in Toronto. But hey, Reddit runs according to Greenwich, and this sub in particular definitely runs on Islay time.

I figured I might as well start the decade with a bang, too. Through 8 reviews on this subreddit, this whisky has an average score of 93.4, making it the second-highest rated scotch in the entire Reddit whisky network. Many of the extremely prolific reviewers count it as one of their all-time favourites. I‚Äôm just lucky enough to live near enough to a bar that has a bottle and doesn‚Äôt charge $500 a glass. 

This was a series of special release Ardbegs, put out between 2001 and 2006, made from 25+ year old 70‚Äôs distillate. Hoo boy.

***

**Ardbeg Lord of the Isles.** Islay single malt. 46% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.

**Local Price:** Not available in Ontario. $43 CAD for a dram at the bar.

**Barrels:** Aged at least 25 years. A vatting of bourbon and sherry casks from the mid-70s. 

**Served:** Neat, in a snifter-thing. Enjoyed at The Feathers bar in Toronto, with good friends. 

***

**Nose:** Loads of earthy Ardbeg smoke, more than expected. Seawater, rocks, leather, earth, and peat smoke. It just smells ancient. Musty earth, ink, seaweed, roasted peanuts, toasted sesame oil, and dried oregano. Crayons? There‚Äôs a surprising soft fruity side as well: Pineapple, dragonfruit, baked apples, pears, and strawberries. Just a hint of sherry. Sweet caramel and milk chocolate in the middle. With time in the glass an earthy malt/bread note emerged, along with more savoury flavours and black tea.

**Palate:** Medium-thick and quite oily. Soft and ancient. Citrus pith and red grapes, then sweet heathery peat, sea-salted caramel, and milk chocolate.  The development is extremely extended. Some sherry emerges here, along with ash, oak, and loads of savoury dark notes that are all going on at once.

Some water helps clear things up. There‚Äôs a bit more ash now, along with tropical fruit flavours of pineapple, coconut, and papaya. There‚Äôs lots of dark chocolate, warm spices, and a strong tobacco note. Some barbequed meat appears here, with mixed peppercorns.

**Finish:** Long and rich, an extension of the development. Black pepper, nori, dried herbs (mustard seeds?), and black tea. Lots of wood sugars and earth, with a bit of soy sauce.

Water helped bring everything together. There‚Äôs blackberries, apples, and dark chocolate. More of that musty element.  

***

**Notes:** It‚Äôs so, so, so complex. There‚Äôs so much depth, so much going on. I couldn‚Äôt do it justice in written form. At the same time, it‚Äôs so easy to drink. The peat is soft but with this understated intensity. The phrase ‚Äúold-school‚Äù is thrown around a lot, but this is certainly an old-school peated whisky. 

Is it the best whisky I‚Äôve ever had? No, it‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt know what it is exactly, maybe it was a bit too soft, maybe I wanted a bit more of that earthy element, maybe it was just my experience that day. I don‚Äôt know. The bottle was still about half-full, but if I didn‚Äôt know any better I‚Äôd say it had been sitting around a while. I was at the bar alongside u/smoked_herring and u/LOL_OILERS, who had a Brora that [I‚Äôve actually reviewed before]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/aa16p8/review_213_brora_18_old_malt_cask_1981_birthday/?
). Given my experience with my review, and with some side-by-side nosing, I might have preferred that Brora by a tiny tiny bit. Looking back, I certainly preferred [Ardbeg 23]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/a4ws5e/review_200_ardbeg_twentysomething_23_years_old/) to this. 

Is it weird that I feel like I have to explain why this isn‚Äôt my favourite whisky ever? I can only ever record and share my own experience, and this time my experience wasn‚Äôt mind-blowing. Subjectivity giveth, and subjectivity taketh away, I guess.

It was still fucking delicious, though.

**Final score:  91/100**

***

**Rating Scale:**

0-49: Blech.

50-59: Save it for mixing. Or chugging.

60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.

70-74: Meh. It‚Äôs definitely drinkable, but can do better.

75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.

80-84: Really quite good. Well above average.

85-89: Excellent, a standout malt.

90-94: Personal favourite.

95-100: Mythical. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever taste a whisky this good.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Trying to be good will never help a person get to heaven.

sure, the grace of god is most certainly necessary for salvation, and our works alone are entirely useless for meriting sanctifying grace. 

however, I think your whole premise -- that we cannot say works are a conditional part of salvation -- makes much of what is in the bible a lie. 

For instance, st. paul writes to us saying in galatians 5: 

*Now the works of the flesh are plain: immorality, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.* 

If people who do these things will not inherit the kingdom of god, then it means that one who inherits the kingdom of god does not do these things. Therefore, inheriting the kingdom of god is conditional upon the work of not doing these things. 

Now then, it is by god's grace that we are forgiven of these things, and likewise, it is by god's grace that we are given the strength to avoid doing them in the future, but it still stands as a hard fact -- the act of avoiding these sins is clearly a condition for inheriting the kingdom of god, and to say otherwise makes st. paul a liar. 

Likewise, christ mentions similar, when he says in matthew 25:

*Then he will say to those at his left hand, ‚ÄòDepart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.‚Äô Then they also will answer, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to thee?‚Äô Then he will answer them, ‚ÄòTruly, I say to you, as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.‚Äô*

Christ here clearly states that those who do not feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, etc, will be told to depart into the eternal fire prepared for the devil. Again, it is a clear statement that salvation is contingent on whether one does or does not do works. And so, your position indeed makes christ himself a liar. 

so, as it stands, in making st. paul and even christ himself into a pair of liars, I can't really back your position.",1577836876

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","Some human lives would still be net negative, or else you would reach a lot of strange conclusions. So who decides who lives and dies? If I (here not necessarily a human) endured conditions you would not, should I be euthanized against my will for the sake of your mental well-being? Or is my ability to endure representative of some lower level of subjective suffering relative to objective conditions? And how would we evaluate that? Through consultation with God? And even with God there to help you out by providing actual objective measures of ""reasons to live"" and ""reasons to die"" that allow you to truly, objectively conclude who gets to live and who doesn't; that's just a hop, skip, and a jump away from the dull *reductio ad absurdum* of the alien superbeing whose ""reasons to live"" are objectively increased by human ""reasons to die"" at a rate greater than 1:1. Ergo, humans should be bred like cattle in huge farms and milked for their suffering. ...something about that analogy makes me uncomfortable.

Anyway. Personally, I lazily err on the side of allowing the organism itself to decide. If your suffering is unbearable, even if overcoming the instinct not to end yourself is too difficult (though that brings into question just how ""unbearable"" this suffering is), assuming this subjective experience has any negative effect on your behaviour at all (and if it doesn't, what *is* suffering?) then you will reproduce less successfully than organisms that suffer less. Thus, over time, organisms will reach some equilibrium of subjective pain:pleasure that is perfectly bearable, no matter how unbearable their conditions might seem to outside observers with different subjective standards derived from adaptations to different environments. Due to individual variation and environmental change, this is certainly not 100% accurate (and probably not very accurate for animals in unnatural conditions like factory farms), but it at least keeps you from accidentally (see: deliberately) wiping out species on decimal errors. And it allows you to sidestep other problem that otherwise arises, like that of considering whether maybe *human lives* aren't actually a net positive either, even if we - like animals stoically enduring net-negative lives - may have evolved to *think* that they are... what if our omniscient God from above, upon consultation, dropped *that* truth bomb and told you anti-natalism was objectively correct? That would be pretty awkward.

Then again, I could just be rationalizing my desire to not have to do anything about this. Certainly, my reaching the conclusion, that actually the best thing to do most of the time is just to do nothing at all, happens to be very convenient for me.",1577836878

Recently, I toasted a fresh player with a shot to the head from an IJ-70 or whatever its called (from a decent bit of range too I might add). Ran up, grabbed his weapon, and revived him. He was SUPER new, first character sorta thing, and was a little bit awestruck. So was I really.....never tried out the revive mechanic. He said you didn't have to kill me, and that he would have given me the gun if i'd asked. I said I couldn't trust you to do that, but I'm sorry for killing you. I gave him food, water, and bandages so he could heal up, but he just dropped dead a minute or so after being revived. That felt shitty.",1577836879

Because your account is new (under 4 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed. Both conditions must be met in their entirety and no exceptions will be made at all.  

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/entitledparents requires all accounts to be at least **4 days old** AND have **at least 100 comment karma** in order to create new threads. Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit.  

Comment karma is *not* the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details. If you're on mobile, use your fucking browser. **Go to https://old.reddit.com/user/me/ to see both kinds of karma.**  

The moderators will no longer be manually approving posts. If your post gets removed and you choose to accumulate comment karma, you will need to post your story again; this post will not be automatically restored.

I've been to the Disney Store, unless a kid has wealthy parents, they aren't getting much from that store. Most of the stuff is increasingly for adults. Because WE have the money!

I'm betting the parks are going to get that way too. Sure, they'll still have tons of kid stuff.  But millennials aren't having as many kids, plus they were raised on Disney.  Disney knows this and is cultivating experiences for adults. Look at all the marvel movies, star wars things coming out and other stuff that they are likely coming out with soon. It's not all for kids.

Older kids maybe, but a good chunk of adults like that stuff too. 

So enjoy the Moana soundtrack to your hearts content! I know so many people in their 20s and 30s that listen to Disney soundtracks, and they don't have kids!",1577836881

"EQ2","t5_2r4sq","From what I've read (and there is some debate but one side fits better with the evidence IMHO) EQN failed for one reason: Landmark.

Sources inside the studio said that Georgeson basically became obsessed with it and kept siphoning resources off EQN development to turn Landmark from the silly sandbox side game it was supposed to be into it's own standalone IP. Apparently by the time Daybreak took over they were both failing because the team had been trying to develop two AAA MMOs with the resources needed to make one, They killed EQN because it hadn't gotten far enough to have actual players yet, and then let Landmark die.

Everquest isn't terribly relevant right now, but I bet a lot of people currently working in MMO development have fond memories of it. I don't know if Daybreak could develop EQ3 on their own, but if they wanted to they could almost certainly find some studio interested in developing it for Daybreak to publish.",1577836882

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","wow, glad to hear that! i mentioned this to another user here already but i honestly didn't think this was possible - at least not for me. once i had all the parts together i procrastinated for almost a week. after i had to tackle the challenge of taking the backplate off the motherboard and not lose the screws, i almost quit. i got talked back down in the end and boy am i glad i saw it through. :) 

my advice is: 
take your time &amp; approach it with love. be understanding of your own mistakes and know that you'll make plenty before you're done. have your workspace tidy when you start and finish your building sessions. make a plan &amp; follow it. try to avoid opening too many construction sites simultaneously. and most importantly: budget building time per session rather than setting specific completion deadlines - your plan can't and won't account for all the little surprises you'll happen across. you'll save yourself plenty of frustration that way :) 

all of those points were take-aways i got from ""winging"" it and i learned those the hard way. maybe you'll be smarter than me and make your own build easier! wishing you much success with your build, i'm sure it'll turn out great! and happy new year to you too",1577836883

La igualdad desde el punto de vista pol√≠tico y legal existe, pero no desde el punto de vista social, ah√≠ es cuando tiene que entrar el estado a equilibrar (claro vos estas en contra de esto y lo ves como beneficio porque sos liberal y seguramente crees en la meritocracia). Lo mismo pasa con los trans y la ley que les asegura un cupo, si tenes un grupo social que tiene una expectativa de vida de 40 a√±os, los discriminan en el mercado laboral condenandolos a la prostituci√≥n, es necesario que el estado intervenga. 

Lo que suma no resta, se van a comprar m√°s tobilleras electr√≥nicas y se va a controlar m√°s para evitar que pasen cosas como el femicidio que sucedi√≥ en navidad. Llegan al punto de ver mal esto porque ""ah con los otros asesinatos no hacen esto, por tanto no deber√≠an hacerlo con ninguno"". ¬øQu√© puede tener de malo que compren m√°s tobilleras electr√≥nicas? ¬øQu√© tiene de malo que aumenten penas a femicidas? En todo caso yo lo veo como ""ah que bueno esto, habr√≠a que aumentar penas a otros homicidas tambi√©n"", y no c√≥mo ""aaah estos progres de mierda nos vuelven a los hombres blancos heterosexuales como ciudadanos de segunda pobres de nosotros somos los verdaderos oprimidos"".",1577836883

Or is it some sort of fixed choke? Maybe it‚Äôs even just plain cylinder bore because the original purpose was the shoot slugs at deer.

The 20‚Äù barrel makes it more suited to be a home defense weapon than a bird-killing machine. In fact, it‚Äôs possible that the barrel can‚Äôt even shoot steel shot because the gun was made back before steel shot was a thing.",1577836886

As much as you love her and as much as you care about this marriage, it sounds like she's been struggling with this thought for a while now and she's made a decision that, while difficult for her as well, she thinks is the right thing to do.

At this point it's probably in your best interest to be as patient and understanding as possible, while looking out for yourself and your well-being as well. Work together as a team to end this as amicably as possible. In the meantime, continue your best life, look out for your kids, and do things that make you feel good. Exercise to get your endorphins going, talk to friends, pick up a new hobby, anything to get you distracted and creating and active. It's not easy AT ALL, but it's the right thing to do to let this one go as best you can.

As the child of divorced parents, I can PROMISE you that your children will be more than ok even if you two aren't together -- in fact they will be even better off if you two aren't trying to hold onto something that isn't working any more. I promise you this as deeply as I can.",1577836886

I think the writers were talking about the idea that people  should be allowed to own guns specifically to be able to overthrow their government. 

I guess put a different way we'd say: the government is not allowed to stop people from owning guns in order to lessen their potential power in a rebellion. 

I think they started with the militia bit and ended with the  bit about guns so there wouldn't be an easy loophole. (As in ""we can't stop you from forming militias but we can stop you from having weapons)


The part after furthermore is more interesting to me. 

I don't argue for the idea that the government should be able to regulate militias, though I understand that is one logical way of moving forward from my original point. 

To summarize (because I'm all over the place). I think the founders wrote in a right for individuals to own weapons specifically in order for the militias to have weapons available. I think it's been warped in a way the founders never wanted. 

I know this is a conversation about the meaning of the Constitution but I'd like to ask you a question because you seem to put a lot of thought onto your arguments. 

Do you think we should put as much faith as we do in a constitution written right before the biggest series of advancements in human history?

It may seem like a loaded question, and from some redditors it might be. But I think many people have never considered that flavor of the ""people wrote this a long time ago"" argument",1577836888

Charisma save doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Why do you need to have a strong personality to dodge fire? Also immunity to fire? No way. Getting two resistances is stretching it. Let alone an immunity.

I don't agree with you about paid sex. It's not dehumanising. You literally pay someone else for labour.

I can tell you my experience, I had a lot of purchases on Ali, expensive and inexpensive orders. And all were OK. If there was anything wrong I manage it to get full refund, or partial refund or new item. I've never lost all money.

Make sure seller is reliable, check seller's percentage score. Then check feedback, see what other buyers saying about item and seller.

If there something wrong with item, yes, you can get full refund or partial.

Always keep your eyes on tracking, make sure where it is all time, so you can react on time.
Always record unboxing your package when it arrive. (make sure everything is OK with item, because it will be good evidence in dispute case)
Do not click ""confirm order received"" even if you got the package, because like that you will have more time to test item, especially when you order electronics.
You can always ask seller to extend your buyer protection time.

In most cases if you got faulty item and wanna full refund, most likely you will have to send it back by your shipping expense.
But you can always ask for partial refund and keep the item. Depends what you wanna at that time.

One time I ordered car lights, but they didn't work, so I got full refund and no need for return item. One time item didn't have some function, so I got partial refund and I kept my item. One time, item didn't arrived and I got full refund.
So it depends on your situations...

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask me.",1577836889

Less and less young healthy people are buying into the private health insurance industry, which is reducing profit as their customer base ages and requires more payouts, so they drive up costs, which results in less young healthy people buying in, which drives up costs, less people, higher costs, less people, higher costs etc. This is happening despite the fact that you can get an exemption from the Medicare Levy Surcharge(A tax paid by those over a certain income) by having PHI. A LOT of people only get the bare minimum PHI that is cheaper than the MLS just to get the MLS exemption, however there seems* to be an increase in people forgoing PHI and just paying the MLS.

*I have nothing to base this on except for my own observations so I may be unknowingly bias and wrong.

Honestly I think any business that is so well established yet is STILL relying on tax exemptions to bring in customers is just a bad business model and deserves to either fail OR be brought into the public sector (And we already have the public sector version: Medicare).",1577836889

Thanks for your submission, but unfortunately we've had to remove your post.


The question of ""Is X worth it?"" and ""Should I get game/item X or Y"" get asked a lot. Ultimately, however, you're going to be the best judge of whether the item in question is a good purchase for you.


If you're trying to get a recommendation about what game to buy you should be including sufficient detail as to games you own, the type of or other specifics about the game you are looking for, what you enjoy in games, what turns you off from games, etc. Otherwise, feel free to ask in our [Daily Question Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/search?q=author%3AAutoModerator+Daily+Question+Thread&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day). As long as you provide some basic information about your interests, games you already own, and budget, they can help you out.

I know for me, I've bought and returned quite a few monitors with Amazon and I haven't come across one yet that looked as good as my AD27QD in terms of backlight bleed/IPS glow.

Part of it is that I know that they really think they are doing the right thing. They believe that the trans/gender rights issue is the civil rights issue of our generation, and want to be on the right side of history. I used to feel the same way about it all because I didn‚Äôt see how it could be harmful in any way. Also, neither of them are actively trying to change policies and laws on this. If they were I‚Äôd feel a lot differently.

I think the other part is that I don‚Äôt want to end a valuable friendship in anticipation of some big drama that could potentially go down. I guess I don‚Äôt want to stoop to their level of rejecting someone outright because of their beliefs. 

If any of my friends start actively trying to change bathroom bills, sports laws, laws regarding transing children; or if any of them corner me about my beliefs on this, than I will probably go NC or VLC. 

I‚Äôm also not really in a position where they could mess me up in my community or career.

Also i find you can actually get a fun save out of a non-United/Liverpool/City save in the premier league (other than fucking work permits). A team like spurs, wolves leicester or everton, or even arsenal/chelsea this year can be great fun. I find its not too easy because AI liverpool and City are fucking ridiulous in terms of their transfers this year, and united just buys everythign in sight so they too are a challenge in a long term save.

Personally as a new buyer I would be looking for something that has a very high rent compared to the mortgage price, so probably something with 3/4brs (even if it's more expensive). This is because I would be expecting to have roommates living with me on my first property, and whenever I did move out of it I would want it to continue being a rental.

Your goals however may be very different from mine, so there is no way for me to give you specific advice on that front.

Having rising home values in the past is a good indicator, but that isn't what I shop for. I think it's a bad idea to try and time the market and instead you need to be asking what deals make the most sense for you today.

I don't feel like most realtors are worth the full fee, I also don't think it's cutthroat to ask for less.

The most intimate you can get is when you see someone in their dying moments. That's when they show their true colors"". The grizzled Major mumbled as he stared at the corpses before the trench, spread throughout no man's land like weeds in a field. ""Nothing quite like it. Don't you agree Private?"". The Private stood bewildered before his superior. ""Are you afraid Sir?"". ""Of dying? No. This rotten war's showed me enough. If I make it back I can't wait to go back home and drink myself to sleep for the rest of my days. If I don't make it? What gives. We're all going to die. Us, them, and everyone back home. Nothing left for us. When I bite the dust, I'm not sure what I'd do. Ask the big man in charge of it all for forgiveness? I've done some awful things to those bastards right across the field. And they have done the same to us. That's why I don't feel remorse anymore. They deserve every bit of it. Every one of my men that's died in front of me I remember. All of the things that they say; the prophecies of the dead men walking. I hear them in my sleep whenever I try to sleep. If I even get the time to do so. Their chants echo in my head. The strongest always cry for their mothers while the meekest wish for the end of war. You hear them too, don't you?"" The Major kept quiet as if to prove a point, but to no avail. As a yellow fog quickly emerged from the side of the enemy, spreading with the help of the wind. A cacophony of coughs, then silence. ""What the hell is that?"", cried the Private. ""You know how I told you I wasn't afraid of dying kid? Im having second thoughts"".

&gt; Seattle Public Schools are giving their students until Jan. 8 to get up to date with their vaccines or they will not be allowed to return to class.

&gt; The new bill that encouraged this initiative from the Seattle Public Schools became state law in July, and was a result of a widespread measles outbreak in the state in January that prompted Gov. Jay Inslee to declare a state of emergency.

&gt; &amp;quot;All we want is for all people in our schools to be able to come in to school and not worry about getting a disease that is a vaccine preventable disease,&amp;quot; Sami Hoag, Seattle Schools student health services manager, said in a video explaining the new initiative.

If Leicester can make the CL this season, they may just be able to keep this team together. There are so many outstanding youngsters age 23 and under that form the core of the side (Chilwell, Soyuncu, Maddison, Ndidi, Hamza, Barnes, Tielemans, Demari Gray, James Justin, perhaps even Iheanacho warrants some inclusion) -- heck, even Ayoze Perez, Ricardo, and Dennis Praet are all only 25-26.

He hasn't totally made up his mind on if he will be pursuing this yet, so he does have a lot of research to do. And I would say he doesn't change his mind a lot - especially if you're asking if I think he will drop out of school. When he puts his mind to something he will absolutely follow through. I am more concerned about his happiness at the end of it all.

I think the issue is not whether or not God knows more about what they will and will not do, it's how they act in the future. If they are unaware of what they can and can't do - that is not a sign that they will or will not, it's just that those actions are what God would want to use.

‚ÄúThen there was the question of what qualifies as ‚Äúrecidivism.‚Äù Some countries and states count any new arrest as recidivism, while others count only new convictions or new prison sentences; still others include parole violations. The numbers most commonly cited in news reports about recidivism, like the 20 percent celebrated by Norway or the 68 percent lamented by the United States, begin to fall apart on closer inspection. That 68 percent, for example, is a three-¬≠year number, but digging into the report shows the more comparable two-¬≠year rate to be 60 percent. And that number reflects not reincarceration (the basis for the Norwegian statistic) but rearrest, a much wider net. Fifteen pages into the Bureau of Justice Statistics report, I found a two-¬≠year reincarceration rate, probably the best available comparison to Norway‚Äôs measures. Kristoffersen‚Äôs caveat in mind, that translated to a much less drastic contrast: Norway, 25 percent; the United States, 28.8 percent.‚Äù

Vladimir Putin was sitting at his desk, gently caressing his muscled abdomen and thinking about some feminist protesters.

However, it wasn't making his nipples hard like usual. 

Sighing, he looked at his desk and his eyes wandered to a picture of Joseph Stalin.

Licking his lips, Putin pictured that glorious moustache caressing his gentle nose and his strong hands, hardened by years of writing down names to send people to the Gulag, caressing his body.

He shivered with arousal.

It was then he realised that was the most he'd been aroused in years.

""I need... I need Joseph"" He gasped as he came without any penis touching. 

It was then he called for his head of writing &amp; propaganda design, Demetri.

Demetri showed up immediately and Putin ordered him to abandon the nuclear weapons they were building and make a time travel machine.

Demetri started to protest but Putin cut him off with a wave of dismissal.

Two days later Demetri came back with a time travel machine.

""Yes, this is what I need.""

Putin stepped inside and set the clock.

However, since he himself had modified Russia's education, he forgot to set the clock to when Stalin was a mature, ruthless dictator.

~ ùíûùíΩùí∂ùìÖùìâùëíùìá ùíØùìåùëú ~

Putin stepped out of the time machine and looked around.

It sure looked like Moscow, and not the Moscow he knew.

He smiled, knowing he had succeeded.

Pulling out his conveniently located map of Stalin's whereabouts at any point in history he licked his lips and attempted to locate ""Stalin, 1940"".

Finding the address relatively quickly, he proceeded to make his way to his office.

Upon arriving at his office, he discovered it didn't contain the one and only Stalin.

It contained Tzar Nic.

""What the fuck."" 

Tzar Nic was surprisingly good natured, and kindly informed Putin that it was not 1940, but in fact 1899.

""Fuck."" Putin sighed, but then smiled as he sensed opportunity.

He looked at his map again and made his way to a small apartment in the outskirts of Moscow.

Knocking on the door, he let himself in when he only heard grunts in reply.

Putin's eyes opened in surprise and disbelief as the young, naked body of 29 year old Joseph Stalin lay before him.

But what really made Putin jump out of his skin was the sight of a young 18 year old Adolf Hitler, also naked, underneath Stalin. 

They were quite obviously boning. 

""WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?"" Stalin bellowed. ‚ÄúTHE CAMPS AREN‚ÄôT READY! HITLER, HIDE! ANOTHER TRAVELER!‚Äù

Hitler got off his knees, wiped his lips and opened a latched door on the ground.

Tormented screams and chains rattling echoed down below, a people in all types of garments, from far into the future to recognizable Russian attire Putin recognized.

The other time travelers.

The ones that wanted to take down the most evil man in history.

‚ÄúThe seeds of designs of what my concentration camps are going to be are sprinkled about.‚Äù The adorable Hitler said, licking the trap door. ‚ÄúThey come for me. I keep them here for now, until the camps are ready. I know... I know this means I will do great work.‚Äù

Putin‚Äôs shakes his head, unable to comprehend, Turing to Joseph again. ""Please Joseph, I am from the future and I am deeply in love with you. I am the President of Russia.""

""Joseph? President? So my plan to overthrow the Tzar worked? This will change everything, we will be able to make the camps soon then.‚Äù

""Yes, and if you will give me some time to explain I can tell you everything about the future.""

""Wow okay.‚Äù

""Only if you fuck me.""

And fuck him he did.

~ ùíûùíΩùí∂ùìÖùìâùëíùìá ùíØùíΩùìáùëíùëí ~

Joseph Stalin was obviously quite desperate to find out who this mysterious stranger was, how he found him and how he claimed to be the president of Russia, so he accepted his offer and beckoned him into the small room where they couldn‚Äôt hear the time travelers begging below the floorboards.

""Joseph... your manhood... it is magnificent."" Putin stared in admiration and lust, forgetting about his own very small but slightly growing penis. ‚ÄúYou remind me of my assistant, Demetri from my time.‚Äù

""I agree, it is as big as my hatred for the Jews.""

It was then that Putin looked over to the young Adolf Hitler again. 

""I didn't know you spoke Russian, Adolf."" 

""We're all conveniently speaking English, for no particular reason. I am fluent in 5 languages - German, English, Russian, Love and Hebrew.""

""Hebrew? But I thought you hated Jews.""

""I do.""

Putin was about to respond when Stalin cut him off with a heated kiss.

""J-Joseph?""

""I am sorry Vladimir, but you are so attractive when you're questioning Adolf here.""

""I do not want to miss out on the fun"" A thick German accent piped up from the back.

Joseph turned around and saw tears filling the large eyes of the German (and half Jew but I mean he doesn't like to mention it) and Joseph held his arms open.

Adolf rushed into them and the two embraced like the lovers they were.

""I just get so jealous, Joseph. When I think of you with anyone else it fills me with such sorrow and gloom that I cannot go on!"" 

""I understand, Adolf. But the young man must learn to share, he can't only play with his toys, he must let his friends play too"" He said, gesturing to a fully erect Putin next to him. 

""Yes, daddy.""

Adolf sucked and licked Joseph's nipple, eliciting a moan from the man.

His head lolled back and Putin took that as an opportunity to ravage his other nipple with his mouth.

Hitler and Putin locked eyes and slowly, Hitler reached out and grabbed Putin's leaking manhood.

He pumped a few times, causing Putin to moan on Joseph's nipple.

As Hitler got more into it, Putin returned the favour by stroking Hitler's length.

He was sizeable, however it was the trimmed hair around the base of his cock was what caused Putin's eyes to roll back into his head.

It was trimmed similarly to his moustache, and it caused Putin to come immediately.

Stalin immediately bent down and licked it off Hitler's stomach, causing Hitler to come into Stalin's face.

Putin then cleaned up Hitler's come.

Right on cue, Stalin came into Putin's eyes, causing a blindness that Putin could get used too, if it meant being with the only two men he had ever thought about sexually.  

~ ùíûùíΩùí∂ùìÖùìâùëíùìá ùêπùëúùìäùìá ~

When the three men were all settled on the comfortable bed, Putin looked at his time travel watch and his heart sank. 

""It seems, comrades, that I must be going. I am needed back in my time."" 

Hitler and Stalin looked shocked, but understood. 

""I will miss you, and think about you every day.""

""I think I speak for Adolf when I say we will never forget about you, Vladimir Putin. One of our time travel camps will be in your honor.‚Äù

Hitler went and kissed Putin on the cheek, while Stalin went for the lips.

""Goodbye my friends, my lovers.""

Putin disappeared.  

A month later, Putin was sitting at his desk writing new laws when one of his assistant Demetri came up to him. 

""Sir, you have mentioned previously that you are interested in artworks of Adolf Hitler, yes?""

""What about my interest?""

""Well, a new piece has been discovered and verified right here, in Russia!""

""What?""

""It has a rather remarkable resemblance to you, sir.""

""That... that cannot be?""

""See for yourself.""

Demetri held up the artwork.

It displayed a shirtless Putin asleep, basking in the morning sun atop a latched trap door, smoke oozing out from the cracks, the following words etched to the top:

#Unser liebster Zeitreisender

A figure lay next to him.

Putin, of course, knew that was Joseph but to the unknowing eye it could have been anyone.

They all looked to be enjoying the smell coming from below them, eyes rolling back.

""Sir, I have to ask, does this have anything to do with that machine you made us build?""

""This conversation is over, Demetri.‚Äù

Putin turned around in his chair, studying the painting.

He ran his finger along the glass encasing the picture, tears welling in his eyes.

If only he could visit the men again, only if for one more night, to be held by Stalin's strong arms and have Hitler curled up at his stomach.",1577836909

[https://imgur.com/gallery/1tMDiuk](https://imgur.com/gallery/1tMDiuk)

For anyone wanting to emulate this, here are the colors I use. If you take a look at any color chart, it's a grid. The rows are numerical, and the columns are alphabetical - for example....

^(.......)`A`^(......)`B`^(.....)`C`^(.....)`D`

`1 a1 b1 c1 d1`

`2 a2 b2 c2 d2`

`3 a3 b3 c3 d3`

`4 a4 b4 c4 d4`

So the nitty-gritty...

**WARFRAME** colors

Primary = A17 (FIRE),  Secondary = A13 (STORM), Tertiary = A17 (FIRE), Accent= E17 (STORM), Emissive1 = E9 (FIRE), Emissive2 = E17 (FIRE), Energy1 = C17 (FIRE), Energy2 = A9 (FIRE)

**ATTACHMENT** (etheria armor) colors

Primary = A10 (STORM), Secondary = A17 (STORM), Tertiary = E17 (FIRE), Accent = E17 (STORM), Emissive1 = E8 (FIRE), Emissive2 = E17 (FIRE), Energy1 = A1 (CLASSIC), Energy2 = A9 (FIRE)

**SYANDANA** (Ki'teer Solstice Syandana) colors

Primary = C12 (STORM), Secondary = E16 (STORM), Tertiary = A9 (STORM), Accent = A15 (STORM), Emissive1 = E8 (FIRE), Emissive2 = D17 (FIRE), Energy1 &amp; Energy2 = n/a

**PRIMARY WEAPON** (Scourge) {Reliquary Skin} colors

Primary &amp; Secondary = A10 (STORM), Tertiary = A17 (STORM), Accent = A9 (FIRE), Emissive1 &amp; Emissive 2 = E17 (STORM), Energy = A16 (STORM)

So with all that out of the way, I tried to make this harrow skin look like an exotic trader prince type. The kind of guy who has attained an unofficial royalty status through the sheer volume of expensive foreign crap he peddles. With the reliquary skin, the noble animation set, and a speargun, the way it stands is very much like a void-trader waiting in a relay for tenno to come and trade.",1577836914

"borderlands3","t5_2v0p0","As a longtime borderlands fan this is really disappointing. I‚Äôve tried to be patient because I know that things take time and I don‚Äôt want h them to rush. Guardian rank breaking was more than a little annoying but I got over it because I still love the game. And this isn‚Äôt nearly as big as that, but it‚Äôs still highly upsetting to me because after the Halloween event I was expecting a Mercenary Day event. I was extremely upset that they didn‚Äôt have a Mercenary Day event, but I thought at the very least I would be able to do the Takedown event with my brother on New Years Eve. And now at the last minute they come out and say that the event isn‚Äôt even starting today? 

As much as I want to keep forgiving them, I can‚Äôt pretend that I‚Äôm not upset. This is a huge bummer when I was looking forward to the holidays being much more glamorous than this after Bloody Harvest. I wanted Borderlands 3 to come out soon yeah, but I honestly would have preferred if it was pushed back another year so that we don‚Äôt have to deal with stuff like this. The game is too broken and maybe it would have given them more time to work on making the writing on the same level as Borderlands 2.

One example is when I was powerlifting, I had good gains when I trained 2-3 times a week, any more than that my CNL got overworked and I got sick(especially doing volume programs(Sheiko etc.)).

&gt;No. The post WWII Soviet Union did not usher the horrors that China currently is.

Been off of it for a year now. My cycles came back regular right away then suddenly stopped. August 2019 was the last time I had a period on my own. That same month was when we decided it‚Äôs time to try to conceive (of course). Took 3 months to get an OB appointment. November took Provera x 5 days, which took 12 days after finishing to induce a period. Then turns out I didn‚Äôt ovulate. And haven‚Äôt had a cycle since. My PCP and OB have no guesses why my cycles stopped. CD3 labs and ultrasound normal per the OB, CD21 showed low progesterone. OB doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs PCOS because cycles were normal before and for a little bit after birth control, and I don‚Äôt have any of the typical symptoms. 

Feeling so alone because it‚Äôs such a mystery. Of course, I‚Äôve now been married 1.5 years so I‚Äôm constantly getting the ‚Äúno kids yet??‚Äù pressures.

Since Hyper-V Server is free according to Microsoft, but buying a whole Windows Server license to just run Hyper-V and a backup service isn't free, why not do the former?

We would be running at least one full Windows Server as a VM for business-specific apps that don't run on Linux, and to manage the Azure Backups app for the whole hypervisor, but the goal with this is to minimize the license and CALs we're buying by reducing as many ""easy"" purchases as we can.

After the city was taken by the Ottomans, they continued to campaign into the Balkans and beyond, sacking and looting cities until they were stopped at Vienna. To this day, Turkey is a dictatorship and refuses to acknowledge their genocide of 1.5 million Armenians.

Think about if you could press a button to be totally completely become female as if you were cis woman completely, (down to the inane second X chromosome) and no one had any recollection that you were any bit male, would you do it? 

Would you only do it if you could change back? Would you do it only for a sec to see what it‚Äôs like or would you spend a considerable amount of time as the sex opposite of your sex at birth? 

What if it was permanent and you could only press it once and then be stuck a woman forever?  

Would you still press that button if people could remember you from before and knew that you had pressed that button? 

What if the button couldn‚Äôt quite 100% turn you biologically female but it was some small thing that no one could see like chromosomes or fertility? 

What if it was something that was visible if someone looked for it?

And what if the button only feminizes you a bit and every additional press of the button would feminize you a bit more? How much would you want to be feminized? -Would you do it if it was permanent or temporary or either? 

If you answered you would press for any of them then you are trans, except if you would only press it just if it was temporary to see what it‚Äôs like and then turn back and never experiment with it, press it or want to be female ever again.

It is incredibly difficult to get a high-paying job regardless of whether you have a degree. People simply aren't hiring for lawyers or programmers, and the positions that *are* open require many years of experience for entry-level positions. In my experience‚Äîhaving a bachelors degree in computer science and multiple awards and honors‚Äîmost entry-level programming positions require somewhere around 4+ years experience. And yes, they often only count experience; several applications I personally submitted literally only counted the amount of work experience in months in order to send the application, and the education component was outright ignored. For example, the exams for state jobs in California are literally scored based on how many months you put it, they aren't even verified and they do not count education even if you meet the requirements of the position.

Someone with a degree stuck at McDonalds is not at fault for their situation, you just don't have a grasp on how difficult it is to get a job better than McDonalds.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Thor scowled down into the dip of the chips and dip. This wasn't going to be a fun meeting. Odin had sent him to the roundtable instead of showing up himself, but based on the reactions when he walked in, people were taking it as a 'Look at least my son is alive' flex.  At least as long as he kept his cool and stayed on the side of the room it was going to be okay.

""Can we get everyone sitting down?"" Anubis asked, there were some murmurs but nobody left the snack table. Anubis was hosting the  meeting in his afterlife, so he had the right to call everyone together but he hadn't had a following for a while so nobody was giving him the proper respect.  ""Please?"" Anubis asked.

""Gods!"" God with a capital G shouted from his chair. He was already in his chair for the meeting, wearing a pair of dark glasses over his eyes so nobody would tell if  he'd been crying or not.  Of course, everyone had seen his reaction on the news but nobody was going to bring that up.

The assembled gods and deities took their places around the circle. Most pantheons had only sent one person so they would have a representation without just arguing with themselves for the entire meeting. Thor took a seat beside Zeus, he'd always gotten along with the other gods of thunder.

""Man this meeting is going to be the worst,"" Zeus whispered, ""I was just about to convince this girl in Athens to put out when they called it and now I'm stuck here.""

""Don't you usually make Athena show up to these meetings?""  Thor asked.

""I'm not gonna send one of my kids that's-"" Zeus gave Thor a quick up-down and registered that he'd been sent by the All Father, ""that would be a totally fine move. Don't worry about it, dude.""

""It'll be fine,"" Thor commented. It wasn't like he was going to be the focus of the meeting. He wasn't even Judaic and was only Roman adjacent. Nobody was going to bring attention to him, right?

""Thanks for showing up on such short notice everyone,"" Anubis read off a set of cue cards he had prepared for himself. ""It's important that we discuss what happened with 'Jee-sus.'""

""Nailed it,"" Ra commented from the back.

""Dude you wanna try names like that with a snout?"" Set shot back at him. There were growls from the back of the room and Thor started playing with the handle of mjolnir, this was why you didn't send pantheons.

""Thank you Ra and Set,"" Anubis sighed before tossing the rest of the cue cards away, ""Look we all know why we're here. One, we need to make sure that we support each other when things like this happen, and two, we need to agree on how we're going to approach this going forward.""

""Can I say something?"" God asked. Geez that was awkward, nobody could really say no so God got up and took the podium. ""Thanks Anubis.""

""Anytime,"" Anubis went to go for a reassuring pat but God kinda shifted away and made it weird, so he moved to the back of the room to join Set and Ra, everyone tried to ignore their snickering.

""OKay, so first thing, I heard some people over at the chip table sayin' that I was gonna flood the world or somethin'"" God slurred.  *Oh Jesus,* Thor thought, *he's drunk.*

*I am also going to need to change my vocabulary,* was the thought that followed.

""I'm not gonna flood the world, or like even part of it. Except  when it's raining. Thor knows what I'm talking about!"" God gave Thor finger guns and the Thunder God offered back a weak smile. ""What a nice boy, that's a son right there who is alive and hasn't been stabbed.""

""Shit,"" Zeus commented from beside Thor.

""Wait, have you been stabbed?"" God asked.

""Not recently no,"" Thor answered. What was he supposed to do in this situation? He was stuck between a rock and a drunk uncle.

""Man that must be nice,""' God said before reaching into his robes to find some communion wine, ""man and when you get stabbed you're still immortal. I sent jesus down to Earth mortal. This is all my fault and-""

""No it isn't,"" God snapped to himself. It was happening again. Ever since God had send his son down to earth he'd split his following and suddenly he had trouble talking to himself. The meeting was gonna be ugly.

""Yes it was,"" He said to himself.

""No it wasn't I did the right thing with being easygoing and-""

""I should have brought a plague, the pharaoh didn't stab my son after I sent the frogs.""

""Jesus christ,"" Thor heard Ra sigh from the back of the room, ""is he bringing that up again?""

""The fuck did you just say?"" God asked.

""Do you want some?"" Zeus asked. Thor snapped his attention to the god beside him who was offering a flask of fine offered wine. ""Gonna be a long meeting.""

""Sure,"" Thor grabbed the flask and took a large swig. Ra had stood up in the back of the room and swore that he didn't mean anything by it.

""Your followers, my followers, round two!"" God shouted from the podium, ""no interventions but you can't make my side slaves first!""

Thor took another swig. At least he wasn't the focus at this meeting.",1577836923

I said that NICS was weak and it is. The ""just fine"" statement was in reference to convenience for myself, an avid firearm enthusiast.

It needs to be a bit more thorough. I'm not saying that we should try to take datapoints about an applicant and try to find an algorithm for whether they might harm themselves or others because holy shit would that ever lead to some infringing, willful or otherwise, but I'm convinced that there is a middle ground that, sure, doesn't make a highly destructive tool less destructive or appealing or politically charged as an object, but maybe it will move the needle, let shooting be a sustainable thing instead of one that causes problems worth addressing i.e. the concerning suicide and homicide issues you mentioned.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Do you think that if both parties' power were reduced through the emergence of a few other legitimate parties that such behavior would be reduced as they sought to secure coalition support?

Condensation occurs when you have the warm humid Petri dish much warmer than the outside air. As warm wet air hits the ceiling of the cool top plate, it condenses into liquid water. 

So, let your dishes cool with the condensation first. 

Once cool, if you were to take a cooled dish and put it under a warm material like a cup of hot water, the ceiling with condensation becomes the warmer part now. All of that condensed water will begin vaporizing into the air again. The now warm+humid air looks for the cooler surface to condense on‚Äîin this case, the cooled agar below is the target surface.

I'm a switch with tastes from sensual loving edging to cruel play on both sides, too ;) i currently have two boyfriends and I'm always dating and looking for more.

I'm very small and tight despite my experience, very light gag reflex- very talented on all ends ;) no one has been disappointed yet!

And more pros and casters joining, as well (including some former players moving to casting/talent roles, which I hope will increase in the future and think will be a net positive for the league).

Personally, I often feel like I'm playing a different game than the folks around here (or I just have a vastly different expectations, tolerances, and lifestyle). I don't have any major complaints with Overwatch in it's current state, and I look forward to what Overwatch 2 brings. I think that Season 3 of Overwatch League will do fine.

Between ""make"" or ""break,"" I'd lean towards ""make,"" but I think that ultimately Season 3 will be a continued progression of defining what the Overwatch League is. Localization is obviously the big differentiation this season, and I'm sure it's not going to happen without some growing pains, but I think that ultimately it will be a plus not only for OWL, but for esports.",1577836930

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","One of the best posts I‚Äôve seen on here in a long time.  I don‚Äôt understand it either. While I‚Äôm far from conventionally handsome, I‚Äôve dealt with women who‚Äôve casually sexually assaulted me (since ass and crotch grabs count in today‚Äôs world), sent me unsolicited naked pics (which I think myself and plenty of people, both men and women, are guilty of), and essentially stalked or harassed me to make out with them. No one send any tears for me or treated me like a victim when this shit happened. And the fucked-up thing is most women don‚Äôt even have to resort to this since they‚Äôre rarely forced to make the first move.

My only logical guess is that women can get away with wild sexuality since men are theoretically physically stronger? I get told men are pigs but honestly, the issue is you‚Äôve got more desperate men due to them making the first move most of the time. As a result, women can have higher standards (I‚Äôve always noticed how it‚Äôs the objectively uglier women doing most of the creep shit since they‚Äôre dying for sex). 

From what I‚Äôve seen from my jock-like friends, women harass the shit out of them in person and on dating apps, the same way some of the whinier-ass women complain about on social media. I‚Äôm talking these guys get flooded in their inbox, hit with unsolicited nudes, lewd come-ons, etc. They‚Äôre just taught not to give a fuck about it unlike when it‚Äôs the other way around.

a small, maybe &lt;100hp electric motor on the rear axle with a 30Kwh battery pack delivering ~150mi range and a newer 2 speed gearbox would make a lot of sense in many cities around the world, and be able to be packaged in something resembling a beetle. Give it a max speed of 160km/h /100mph and tailor the drive towards reasonable performance below 80km/h and it'll meet the needs of millions.

Tailoring it to low speed, city driving would lower the importance of aero efficiency to an extent, but really I think a retro Golf EV styled on the Mk1 would make more sense yet still pull at the heartstrings (basically something like the Honda Urban EV).",1577836930

2. As for your deck, I see what you are trying to do but it seems extremely janky and would be difficult to climb a lot with. If you want to keep the lock and poison packages and overall feel of the deck, I would probably cut Assire for Cupbearer to get more poison and a purify in deck as well as change Bonhart for Maraal as you already have enough tall removal with poison and this provides more flexibility for less provisions. You probably struggle putting points on board with lock cards like Armored Cavalry but are playing for a big finisher with high provision cards.

"tifu","t5_2to41","1.) I'm not willing to blindly accept ""the rich run our government,"" and neither should you. They stole the government, but it can be stolen back.

2.) If you believe that there are people who would use guns to murder people just because they have guns and others don't, that's all the more reason to disarm them.

3.) All the problems you mentioned need to be addressed, but none of the things you mentioned are as singularly designed to take *another* person's life as guns are. Addiction is a disease we demonize and refuse to treat. Suicide and mental illness are also huge issues we refuse to treat. Drunk driving has *far* more regulations around it than gun ownership. The broken health care system is the only issue I feel is more pressing than the gun issue to be honest.

4.) This is a bizarre one-off and shouldn't be a meaningful factor in this discussion. I work for big pharma; if health care were nationalized tomorrow I would likely be out of a job, and I'm okay with that because it would fix a huge systemic problem.

5.) Sure, museums, why not. Again, I'm not sure why we're focusing on bizarre one-offs, but fine.",1577836931

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","&gt; 4-6k Titanium ... in ~15-20min.

While I kind of doubt that number based on my experience I can't fully deny it. With a booster maybe? At best that means it will take you something like 1-2+ hours of this mindless grind to get the titanium for ONE item to repair. It took me far less time to farm the 15 argon crystals and I got very unlucky there.

For reference: Brozime had something like 16k titanium in ~30 hours of actually playing railjack (normal gamplay and not dedicated mindless flying around in space shooting rocks for titanium/...). That is enough for a single repair of a drop. That is not an acceptable rate.

&gt; Agree to disagree here, sorry. I didn't care about the drones.

You can disagree but if a system is so badly designed that farming the plat is several times faster than farming the resources, I think we can agree that there is something very wrong. 

Considering all the other decisions DE has made recently (Mod boosters, RNG crapshoot,...) I consider it intentional ""design flaws"" to sell boosters and repair drones.

That's how you seem to be describing it - in venn diagram terms 'what is fun' is one circle, the groups style and interactions are another circle and are inside 'what is fun' and the rules of the game are another circle and they are way, way outside the 'what is fun' circle.

Highly depends on the person, if your main goal isn't related to systems or graphics, **then drop it because you are wasting your time**, most C++ job positions I've seen require a generous amount of skill and / or experience, but don't quote me on that one, its just what I've seen.

I would suggest **Python** to beginners who still don't have a clear goal in mind, get comfortable with programming then spent a month or two learning **C** so you can understand (among many other things) why an String is an array of characters.

I'm confident you'll have a better grasp of programming if you switch from **C++** to those languages, again, there's nothing wrong with it, just not for beginners.

Trust me on this you will see C++ in a whole different way once you learn the basics, the difference will be black and white, but preferably do learn the basics in another language.",1577836934

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","To start glad to you agree on the point in general. I try to avoid discussing Xhaka the player on here because people have very passionate and as such biased opinions. I rate Xhaka as one of 2 central midfielders on our squad talented enough to start every week. 

I don‚Äôt think that Joelinton, haller, manolas, Silva, piatek, Ben yedder and a couple more I listed would have the sort of resale value you‚Äôre imagining without some serious improvement, certainly no better than Xhakas at current talent levels. We can speculate they‚Äôd improve but that‚Äôs nothing more than speculation. 

Not to mention the deals in the 20-30m range that generally, when taking into account agent fees and costs of business, are well over 40 to the buying club. The Haaland transfer will cost over 40m now but will show up on transfermarkt for 20 something. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs possible we find a much better deal, not nearly as outlandish as you may suggest. And we would be foolish to not try to do that. 

Part of the discrepancy here is that it needs to be accepted as fact that Hertha or whoever are in for Xhaka do rate the player. No ‚Äúastute board‚Äù as you put it would rate a player and decide to purchase them based on the opinions of that clubs fans, we are irrelevant in this. They have an assessment of Xhaka that goes beyond ‚Äúbeen garbage last couple years‚Äù.

I have heavy inattentive and impulsive traits and I do take medication. When I‚Äôm off my meds, the impulsivity feels like having a mental and emotional hunger that can‚Äôt be satiated by anything I do or try to occupy my mind with.

Meanwhile, the inattentive trait feels like I‚Äôm driving through a heavy rain storm with windshield wipers that barely work. I‚Äôm desperately trying to see the road ahead, but my view keeps getting obstructed despite having my wipers on max. It‚Äôs no wonder I‚Äôm only going 10mph while everyone else is going 40. If I had to go 40mph I‚Äôd be in a metaphorical ditch on the side of the road.


To help me avoid those ditches I‚Äôve developed support habits that include methodical analysis, reading prompts multiple times, and double/triple checking my work. Stuff that‚Äôs a luxury for most people, but that allows me to achieve at their same level despite taking a much longer amount of time.


The meds help with nearly 100% of the impulsivity and about 75% of the inattentiveness symptoms for the 7ish hours a day they‚Äôre in effect. If I take more I don‚Äôt sleep. 


People see that I‚Äôm high performing and they notice I‚Äôm on ADHD meds and get accommodations and they think it gives me an upper-hand. The truth of the matter is I spent 17 undiagnosed years busting my ass just so I could be a disappointment to myself, my parents and my teachers. When I apply that same amount of effort without my ADHD sabotaging me, it‚Äôs really easy to outperform everyone‚Äôs expectations and make it look easy. I‚Äôm still working twice as hard as most people.",1577836935

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Sympathy is never a factor expressed by employers as if it‚Äôs not you doing it for them they will find someone else. But I‚Äôve also never been out of work because I am a good worker regardless of the days I‚Äôm not there. Here in Aus there‚Äôs different laws but yes taking random days or worse consistently taking them does not ever count in your favour and eventually like it or not they build up and yes they work against you. This is human nature to become vindictive and spiteful over such things.

As said I‚Äôve only ever been paid to work and never received $1 for for not doing so (as in reality government benefits just don‚Äôt let you function or survive but merely exist in life) especially by employers so unless anybody can explain to me why I should explain to them any more than a bucket full of bodily fluids I will gladly state they are crossing the line unfairly and if that be the case to excess I am happy to take my skills elsewhere and work for someone else if you would prefer me to do so?‚Ä¶ this has always (for me) resulted in a ‚Äòbacking down‚Äô over such factors as suddenly a harsh and angry telling down is all that‚Äôs received. TBH the one thing that REALLY helped me (when I had this issue) was a sudden and severe migraine at work while they watched, they would not permit me to leave and 30min later they decided it actually would be better to not have me vomiting all over the workplace so relented to finally drive me home via a few work deliveries‚Ä¶ we got less than 200 metres down the highway before I was out the window like a gushing fire hydrant spraying the traffic in a giant advertising billboard. I am not sure if anybody complained as such but I know they then decided to ‚Äòjust let me go home‚Äô virtually from that point on but otherwise for me other than meds and a maybe dr certificate for a day or so they have not been much use
*and YES I have only ever had to bring ‚Äòmy bucket of bodily fluids‚Äô in once and as you can imagine NO it was not well received but yes amazingly it got me what I wanted without being fired (but that‚Äôs another story)",1577836937

These are no areas with plants that benifit from burning. Some of them scientists are unsure if they've ever burned, or if they have when the last time was.

That's part of what makes these fires so unprecedented - we've gotten so hot and dry, and the fires have been so severe, that the fire is effecting vast swaths of land that shouldn't be burning.

But going back to the areas that can handle a bit of fire - the key word is a bit. The ecosysyem did not evolve to all burn down at once.",1577836937

The reality of being a girl on a dating app is that you are flooded with male interest. Dating apps are weird because you know absolutely nothing but what men choose to tell you or how they behave in the very constrained setting of a date (if it gets that far). In real world dating, you typically date within a social circle/ community (i.e. friend of a friend, college classmate, etc) so you have a lot more data points about a guy based on how he treats others and external, corroborated evidence. On dating apps, you‚Äôre essentially operating in a vacuum.  Which is fine, except as I mentioned girls get a TON of men expressing interest and being able to get a better glimpse into a man‚Äôs life (via social media profiles) can put women at ease and help them decide if they‚Äôre interested without putting in concerted effort to get to know 75 different men individually. Men are comfortable deciding if they‚Äôre interested based on purely visual information about a girl‚Äôs face and body. Women like more information, and frankly, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs less shallow, not more. 

Not everyone is interested in you enough from day 1 to take the time to get to know you over the 60 other guys expressing interest. There‚Äôs also safety concerns as a girl. Dating a complete stranger can be uncomfortable since they have no clue who you are and no mutual friends or outside info about your life. Men without social media profiles can appear like they have something to hide. That‚Äôs not always the case, obviously, but surely you can see why it‚Äôs a rational thought. And frankly why should a complete stranger give you the benefit of the doubt and presume that your anti-social media position is a purely moral stance? Don‚Äôt date if you take everything so personally.",1577836938

Nevermind that Iceborne monsters in single player already have more HP than previous games' G-rank mons (which, like you said, was always scaled for multiplayer). Honestly that just sounds like a total chore to me, I don't want to take an eternity just to kill a monster. IMO there's a sweetspot for the HP values of monsters so that they can be engaging without being total pushovers or an absolute chore: World had too little, ATs had too much, Iceborne solo and previous games' G-rank strike that sweetspot for the most part.",1577836938

Not to piss on your parade, but that's actually not how upvotes are supposed to be used at all. It's not agree/disagree, nor ""like/dislike"" but rather ""this contributes to the thread in a positive way / this does not contribute""

But people mostly use it as ""like / dislike,"" because they never actually read the sitewide rules and reddiquette.

And I get that it's not exactly intuitive, because it's used as ""like/dislike"" on pretty much every other website on Earth, and that's basically Reddit's fault.

But it's designed that way, because of what votes actually **do**. Votes create points, and point determines position and visibility. So when the system is used as intended, the best content rises to the top of the thread, so people can see the really relevant and important stuff first.

Comments with enough downvotes are collapsed from view, so you actually have to click stuff to read it.

But people mostly just upvote stuff they like... Which *sometimes* has a similar effect, but often leads to jokes at the top of serious threads where more on topic discussion might be more appropriate or appreciated. ...and other unintentional consequences.

"birthcontrol","t5_2snsq","I had my kyleena inserted at the end of July of this year and the cramps during my period have definitely been significantly worse than pre-IUD, I have also noticed that my periods have been prolonged, but much lighter. It is expected to have messed up cycles for the first little while after starting ANY new birth control method and unfortunately it may last for a few months! If you are soaking through a pad/tampon in less than an hour that would be considered heavy bleeding + may be of concern if this is abnormal for you. 

In terms of checking for the strings, if you are comfortable with it simply wash your hands and insert a finger into your vagina -- you should be able to easily feel the strings. From what I can tell when I check mine, the far end of the string reaches to around the 2nd knuckle on my middle finger.

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","Here's an easier way to think about it.

The Thor comic books are a pretty serious case of Cultural Appropriation, right? In terms of how they appropriate Norse Mythology. But it's also pretty obvious that they don't really bear much on actual Norse Mythology, because it's all so divorced from the context and cultural heritage of the original mythology that if you tried to do a ""here's how Marvel's Thor‚Ñ¢ is anti-Nordic propaganda!"" hot take, you'd come across pretty silly (though not necessarily *incorrect*, to be fair). Because 

* The people who created/create the Thor Comic Books don't have an active, systemic ""Colonizer‚ÜíColonized"" relationship with major Norse worshipers
* The Thor Comic Books use a lot of the symbols and low-hanging-myths as template, but otherwise have completely scrapped or otherwise rewritten everything else related to that relationship

Well, Eva's relationship to Judeo-Christian iconography is just a palette-swapped version of that. They're not meaningfully using the actual text or substance of Judaism or Christianity in any meaningful context, they're just using the famous symbols and names and reappropriating them for their use in mysticism.

So it's totally valid to describe Eva's use of Judeo-Christian iconography as Cultural Appropriation, and *maybe* you can stretch it to argue that it's potentially harmful, but the only way Eva even subtextually teaches negative things about Judaism or Christianity is if you're already a Nazi force-fitting all your cultural input into a box that supports your Racism, and that's not the fault of the text.",1577836943

Nothing takes out the power from these guns. These changes still have them as power weapons. Lancer is moderate rage of fire, moderate damage. Moderate range. That‚Äôs the lancer 

Retro is supposed to be a slower rage of fire higher damage. 

The GL is an oxymoron. 

Being cross fired by lancers getting killed in 1 second like COD is not Gears. At all. It allows teams to camp up. TDM in Gears 5 is dead. The pace is slowed down the lancer heavy map design. 

Boom shot is broken, the blast radius needs to be increased a bit.

The lancer is not weapon used to kill. It‚Äôs meant to cross fire and cover. The Gears 4 Lancer in core was perfect. It was perfect. Just a little weaker than 5‚Äôs.

&gt; Singapore Sling is a shoegaze band from Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. The group was formed in 2000 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Henrik Bj√∂rnsson, aided by his friend, guitarist Einar √û√≥r Kristj√°nsson.

&gt; Their neo-psychedelia sound has often been compared by the media to acts such as The Velvet Underground, My Bloody Valentine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Serena Maneesh. Although, in a tongue-in-cheek statement, the band's frontman Henrik Bj√∂rnsson defines it as ""a cross between Simon and Garfunkel"".

&gt; As of 2016 they have released eight studio albums and a best of compilation. Singapore Sling have supported The Brian Jonestown Massacre on their North American tours and covered ""Dirty Water"", a 1966 garage rock hit by The Standells in their debut album. They have also covered The Monks' ""I Hate You"" in the 2006 compilation Silver Monk Time: A Tribute to the Monks.

&gt; Singapore Sling was formed in Spring of 2000 in Reykjav√≠k, the capital of Iceland, with the reunion of Bj√∂rnsson and Kristj√°nsson. Bj√∂rnsson had some 8-track demos and wanted to create a band. One of these demos surfaced online in the Iceland Airwaves 2001 official website and later became ""Overdriver"", the opening track of their debut LP.

&gt; While Bj√∂rnsson is the sole official member, as well as the primary musician on the band's recordings, the live and studio lineup has changed from its original incarnation, and as of November 2015, consists of:

&gt;     * Henrik Bj√∂rnsson: vocals / guitar / keyboard
    * Einar √û√≥r Kristj√°nsson: lead guitar
    * Ester B√≠b√≠ √Åsgeirsd√≥ttir: bass guitar
    * Bj√∂rn Viktorsson: drums

&gt; Beginning in 2008, Bj√∂rnsson participated in the band Dead Skeletons. He also formed a side project called The Go-Go Darkness as a duo with his wife, Elsa Mar√≠a Bl√∂ndal. Bj√∂rn Viktorsson was previously the drummer of Dean Sean and also worked with Glasgow-based electro/psyche act The Cheesemongers. Read more on Last.fm.

B2) **Do not delete this submission** (or ANY submission past or present), for any reason, or any of your comments as it will result in a ban.  If your request is fulfilled or you **no longer need the money** please do one or a combination of A) edit your post to reflect the change, B) flair your post as 'complete' (the flair button is under the body text of the post), and/or C) make a comment that it's no longer needed.

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) Moderators strongly suggest requiring that a lender comment on your REQ post before you send them any personal information. Banned or ineligible lenders cannot comment here. B) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. C) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately D) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if TheBlindScribe has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=TheBlindScribe&amp;restrict_sr=on)

Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user‚Äôs **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

Are you really saying you'd give away Daniel Jones and Saquon in favor of Rosen??? This is a horrible take. Also Mara said told him to give Eli one last run so why draft someone if you don't think he's your guy?",1577836949

&gt;Men are better in spatial coordination and have a better sense of direction (usually!). They excel in math and are great at interpreting three-dimensional objects. They have a better hand-eye coordination and more precise control of large muscle movement. They have poor peripheral vision but better sight in bright light and a better sense of perspective. Since they use one side of their brain more than the other, they tend to use the left side for verbal reasoning and the right for visual and emotional activities (if they are right handed).

&gt;These differences are not rules. It is easy to find women who excel in math and men who have excellent language skills (and it is even easier to find men with no sense of direction). Chances are the above statements are not going to work for your everyday situation, but these have been shown to be true in scientific studies, based on large, diverse populations. When looking at large populations, these differences between men and women become evident, and proper statistical analysis takes care of the exceptions.",1577836950

"" 

Meaningful and portentous messages are cast forth each eighteen years, and are acted upon for the eighteen years which follow, at the end of which a new statement appears. The Ice Age from which we recently emerged began in the year 508 ""A.D."" Just as the Zenith of passion for what each Working has inspired occurs halfway between the Working Years, so the greatest intensity of each Age's message occurs at its midpoint. Thus in the year 1237 ""A.D."" man's fervor for what the last Ice Age represented had reached its summit. That Age ended in 1966, and the new Age of Fire was born.

The twentieth century has prepared us for the future and the coming of the Age of Fire was well heralded in the last Working Years of the Ice Age. The peoples of the Earth have been touched by the vehicles of 1894, 1912, 1930, and 1948, and communication has been well wrought. The new Satanic Age was born in 1966, and that is why His Church was built.

The infant is learning to walk, and by the first Working Year of his age - that is to say 1984 - he will have steadied his steps, and by the next - 2002 - he will have attained maturity, and his reign will be filled with wisdom, reason and delight.

REGE SATANAS!

AVE, SATANAS!

HAIL, SATAN!

I think initially, people were assuming I'd get the hint that it was private and intimate and I just wasn't. As for myself, I'm getting better at catching on and confirming this is a private conversation.

I don't want to be rude, but do your friends really have to confirm a basic tenet of friendship -- which is trust -- every time they tell you something in order to get you to be an actual friend? Shouldn't you know this on your own, without being told? I'll never understand why people justify violating their friends' confidence and trust by blabbing everything to their SOs.

"flashcarts","t5_35sng","My view is that there are three decent reasons for purchasing the R4i Gold 3DS RTS Plus.

1.) Using the ntrboot switch on this particular flashcart makes [installing CFW](https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot) on your New 3DS XL the easiest method by far. Great for picking up extra 2/3DS units used, flashing them and turning them into gifts, backup units, or helping friends/family out.

2.) Yes, TwilightMenu++ is fantastic and gets better frequently, and plays the majority of games that the average range of gamers want. However, for those that it doesn't work with, the flashcart does by and large. This brings me to point three...

3.) If you come across a DS Lite unit, with this flashcart you can play everything (barring DSiWare stuff, which you can play natively on a CFW'd 2/3DS unit for the best experience anyway).

"LushCosmetics","t5_2tqbr","Scrub x3 is definitely not the same scent family as Comforter. They share a common potent black currant note, but that‚Äôs about it. Scrub x3 includes blackberry, lime, buchu, rosemary and pine. Its a sweet and sour scent. Comforter is bergamot, cassis and cypress, and tends to read as sweeter and creamier overall. 

Junk isn‚Äôt the same scent family as either one, though I‚Äôd think it would read closer to Scrub x3 than Comforter. Junk is also a black currant scent, but it‚Äôs also full of lemon, mandarin, rosemary and sage. The black currant + citrus + rosemary scent construct is very similar between Junk and Scrub x3, so while they‚Äôre not the same scent, I could see how they‚Äôd read as similar. 

Anyone smelling Comforter and Scrub x3 as the same scent is probably very sensitive to black currant as a scent note. It‚Äôs prominent in both, and in Junk too, but the scents are all quite different. Junk is the most purely herbal take on the black currant scent, I think - it smells like a mashup of herbs and berries that feels very wild to me. Scrub x3 is a sour take on black currant that some people smell as fresh and others interpret as candy-like. Comforter is almost universally perceived as sweet and creamy like sugared berries.

We drove a brand new car for 5 years with a bashed in side before we saved enough money to get it fixed.  We had to take a personal loan out for the other car damages.  He was responsible to bring Christmas dinner to our vacation home, where everyone had flown in.  He showed up empty handed - no food-and said he hadn‚Äôt had time to stop at the store.  We went to a 24 hour deli, on Christmas Eve for groceries because he was the one who had agreed to buy and bring all the  food for the weekend.

That they are entitled to shoot up in public and that other people should have to deal with the aftermath? That if we're poor enough we no longer have any responsibility or culpability for our actions, or are not responsible for how our actions affect other people?

Because guess what? *I* am in poverty and have medical issues of my own, and I'd never dream of doing something that fucking stupid. And I've done some incredibly stupid shit because of my poverty in my life.

Being poor doesn't excuse shitty behavior, mean that we don't have agency or that we're not responsible for our actions. 

&gt;If you chase them out of the public bathroom, then they'll be public somewhere else.

Another strawman. The issue isn't their socioeconomic status, it's the fact that they're shooting up heroin in a public bathroom. If they were *rich* the business owners would have just as much right to turn them away, and others would be just as horrified depending on the venue.

You're just a woefully misguided lunatic exploiting others to justify taking away our right to hold others accountable for their actions, and you're doing *nothing* to help people who actually are poor by doing this. *Nothing.* I will not have a single fucking dime in my pocket because of you trying to impose your shitty way of thinking onto everybody else, and neither will any retard who does have the nerve to shoot up in a public bathroom.

If they want to sell recreational marijuana, they are going to have to pay all the taxes. If they are going to sell cannabis, they have to pay all the taxes for the plants, including taxes on plants that are grown in their own farm.

If you want to sell cannabis, you have to pay all of the taxes that make them, and even if you sell cannabis for recreational purposes, you'll still be required to pay all the taxes for the cannabis you grow.

Beggars is braindead click mouse1 repeatedly to win

Gas passer is incredibly braindead OP so I guess sure, but did you know the thermal thruster has stun on land? When used correctly its basically a less braindead EOI and can stun ubered meds, certainly a viable option that isnt stupid op

Soda popper is a more cost effective shortstop, and everyone decent at damage scout will tell you stock is the best way to go. Dont ever use FaN because juggling bots is aids for the other 5 teammates, same with scorch and loose cannon. 

Huntsman is certainly high skill ceiling in mvm and not as insanely powerful as EH, but effective at giant killing if youve got medpicking and crowd control taken care of by other players.

"nyc","t5_2qhu2","Here's /r/ProtectAndServe's Automod response to the 40% statistic...  
   
Hello, you seem to be referencing an often misquoted statistic. TL:DR; The 40% number is wrong and plain old bad science. In attempt to recreate the numbers, by the same researchers, they received a rate of 24% while including violence as shouting. Further researchers found rates of 7%, 7.8%, 10%, and 13% with stricter definitions and better research methodology.

The 40% claim is intentionally misleading and unequivocally inaccurate. Numerous studies over the years report domestic violence rates in police families as low as 7%, with the highest at 40% defining violence to include shouting or a loss of temper. The referenced study where the 40% claim originates is Neidig, P.H.., Russell, H.E. &amp; Seng, A.F. (1992). Interspousal aggression in law enforcement families: A preliminary investigation. It states:

Survey results revealed that approximately 40% of the participating officers reported marital conflicts involving physical aggression in the previous year.

There are a number of flaws with the aforementioned study:

The study includes as 'violent incidents' a one time push, shove, shout, loss of temper, or an incidents where a spouse acted out in anger. These do not meet the legal standard for domestic violence. This same study reports that the victims reported a 10% rate of physical domestic violence from their partner. The statement doesn't indicate who the aggressor is; the officer or the spouse. The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The ‚Äúdomestic violence‚Äù acts are not confirmed as actually being violent. The study occurred nearly 30 years ago. This study shows minority and female officers were more likely to commit the DV, and white males were least likely. Additional reference from a Congressional hearing on the study: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003089863c

An additional study conducted by the same researcher, which reported rates of 24%, suffer from additional flaws:

The study is a survey and not an empirical scientific study. The study was not a random sample, and was isolated to high ranking officers at a police conference. This study also occurred nearly 30 years ago.

More current research, including a larger empirical study with thousands of responses from 2009 notes, 'Over 87 percent of officers reported never having engaged in physical domestic violence in their lifetime.' Blumenstein, Lindsey, Domestic violence within law enforcement families: The link between traditional police subculture and domestic violence among police (2009). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1862

Yet another study ""indicated that 10 percent of respondents (148 candidates) admitted to having ever slapped, punched, or otherwise injured a spouse or romantic partner, with 7.2 percent (110 candidates) stating that this had happened once, and 2.1 percent (33 candidates) indicating that this had happened two or three times. Repeated abuse (four or more occurrences) was reported by only five respondents (0.3 percent)."" A.H. Ryan JR, Department of Defense, Polygraph Institute ‚ÄúThe Prevalence of Domestic Violence in Police Families.‚Äù http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4951188/FID707/Root/New/030PG297.PDF

Another: In a 1999 study, 7% of Baltimore City police officers admitted to 'getting physical' (pushing, shoving, grabbing and/or hitting) with a partner. A 2000 study of seven law enforcement agencies in the Southeast and Midwest United States found 10% of officers reporting that they had slapped, punched, or otherwise injured their partners. L.

Having been abused as a kid myself and had a less than optimal family situation has led me to some pretty strong opinions on children's welfare in general tbh- IMO ideally and even within the present-day capitalist society we live in at the very least children's rights should always supercede those of parents, and the state should be seen as the primary guardian of the child with parents merely granted permission to raise the child so long as it isn't abusive, oppressive, etc- so that any violation of a child's basic human needs (clothing, food, shelter, medical care, education, not being treated like shit) and rights (like fair process re: not being treated like shit, rights regarding not being discriminated against due to gender, sexuality, identity, etc) is something the government should be directly responsible for and constantly defend.",1577836959

100%, yes. Maybe they're paying you the license cost and a fee, or they're paying for the license directly, but someone is paying for that license. 

Use of a community edition of one of the RPA products in an enterprise environment will get you slapped by a nice lawsuit. Read, re-read, and have your lawyer read the terms of use for any CE of the big RPA players out there (UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, Pega, WorkFusion, etc). 

You can absolutely use scripts, but be aware that while languages like Python, Powershell, VB, etc are all capable of doing the same work RPA does, the reason why RPA products exist in the market is because they've been purpose built for this kind of work. I could automate anything I do in UiPath with VB.net, but it would take me 10 times as long.

On top of that, it's harder to pass training for maintaining these automations onto the business users. I can teach a lawyer or an accountant UiPath; I can't teach them VB.net or Powershell.",1577836960

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Talon's reworked E somehow just still feels *awkward* to use. Half the time jumping over a wall isn't even quicker than just walking around it and slower than many other jumps, while stunning yourself for a second in the meantime. And the updated W is just... so much worse than the old one. It's flat out a frustrating spell to use *every time*. 


To keep up the rant, old Talon could also make plays with the big aoe damage of his W and R in teamfights, but now so much of his damage is packed in his single-target passive proc that this is never possible anymore. You either manage to flank and assassinate a squishy that doesn't have f*cking stopwatch, or you do nothing at all.


I'm probably just getting old, but for every rework that was a big succes (like Sion) , there are several reworks that made me stop playing champs that used to be favourites of mine; like Gangplank ( esp the old voice-over ), Graves , Talon and even Shen ( seriously who the fk actually **likes** that Spirit blade mechanic??).",1577836960

I agree! Free is free! I don't practice that myself. But if I like a game enough I'd still offer to steam.

Technically other sites don't use language that describes a Chinese company owning portions of their company, and then tries to explain away ""they don't really have much to do with us"". I'm happy that steam relates with other nations/ users and they're at least transparent about it. 

&gt;the claims that the EGS sells your info are not based on facts really just speculation.

Maybe, but you'd think given how closely the dots connect it's a more likely than average proposition.

The system itself has and will continue to treat marriage and men like shit, even if the behavior of women changes. Which is the most sobering part imo. You can have a supposedly great candidate for marriage but there's just too much risk so all the time spent searching means essentially nothing.

I'd pay for a print file to print them myself though, but not at the price per they want honestly.

The way people react to ""racism"" these days and are so quick to get offended and act like saying a couple of racist things justifies flying off the deep end and doing something like abort a baby over it is INSANE.

Im not a naive bleeding heart person and I have grandparents and parents who grew up through the 1940s and 1960s...if I disowned every person I know who's ever said something racist I'd have nobody left to talk to.

I finished my associates degree at a community college and because of how the program i wanted was structured i had a 9 month gap from then to going to university. And I was terrified I would fail. So I delved into escapist fantasy and played a LOT of 14. 

I got really into bard in stormblood and raiding and getting my numbers higher and doing my best and practicing and finding new ways to do it. I had goals after my first roadblock being byakko ex on content and I met them through wanting to and acting on that want to practice rather than letting it by chance fall into my lap. I joined statics and raided. By the time I was in my university, I was still terrified but I did really well. For someone who would get maybe a 2.5 average a 3.9 was kind of something else. 

Last spring was when I had to actually apply to my program and I was one of the 48 people who got in. I dont say it a lot to people because it doesnt make a lot of sense but ff14 built a goal oriented mindset into me and helped me mature from a kid to someone who can make plans for the future and follow through. It really taught me that for me to do well I need to put in the work and care about doing better. I dont play ff14 during the school semester but despite that it remains the most influential game of my life. Thanks for letting me ramble.",1577836968

"gametales","t5_2wqgc","I feel like this is me in my current group. High-CHA paladin, I sort of fell into the role of being the party Face. The problem with this is that it means the other players just sort of take a back seat to any actual plot. I do what I can to include the other characters, but one is a barbarian with CHA as a dump stat (and a penchant for becoming enraged at the slightest provocation,) and another is a druid hermit who hates humans. Both of those characters are also played by people who have never touched a tabletop game before, and have no idea how to RP aside from murderhobo‚Äôing.

Our cleric gets a lot of screen time too, but that‚Äôs largely because he‚Äôs the most experienced player aside from myself, and knows how to RP his way through situations. So it‚Äôs largely the me and the cleric dragging two murderhobos around from one side quest to the next. And that means when it‚Äôs time to do things like investigate an area or probe for plot hooks, it‚Äôs always me and the cleric who do that. The other two players will *watch us make perception checks upon entering a room* and not think to do the same. *The druid has the Observant feat*. So I pretty regularly end up hinting ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything here, but *maybe someone more* **observant** *than me will find something.*‚Äù Just little things like that.

There are a series of bilge pumps, the bilge pumps are a type of eductor and are located in the bilges of specific Engineering spaces. Other spaces don't have a bilge pump but, have a bilge.

In order to dewater those spaces there is a myriad of portable equipment to achieve that goal. Several different eductors (Uses water pressure to dewater), P100 (Uses gas &amp; water), and a submersible electric pump. 

If the water is well below the weather decks there are ports located every 50(IIRC) frames where you can hook the output hose to to send it over the side. 

This is a warship however. I don't recall any drain plugs and don't know where you would put them, also I don't know about cruise ships but, we used external water and pumped it through a reverse osmosis machine.",1577836970

I have read Behind Closed Doors and just started The Silent Patient last night! 

I like Karen Rose, Andrea Kane, Tami Hoag and Allison Brennan for more procedural mysteries. Karen Rose books are more of romantic thrillers, but have good pacing and mysteries. 

Jane Harper is another such author with a couple of books set in Australia. Linda Castillo has a series of books set in Amish country: makes for an interesting change of pace.

P.J. Tracy has a series with a nice tech aspect.

Erica Spindler is another author who writes good thrillers. She has a couple of books in a series and standalone books.

Combing my Goodreads list, I see some other thrillers I liked recently:

\- The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn

\- Let Me Lie by Clare Mackintosh

\- Sometimes I Lie by Alice Feeney

\- The Last Time I Lied by Riley Sager (I don't know why they're all lying!)

\- The Wicked Girls by Alex Marwood

\- Where They Found Her by Kimberly McCreight

"FinancialPlanning","t5_2qwze","This is my opinion. Never ever consider a private college unless you‚Äôre rich. Don‚Äôt even go there if they offer anything less than a 100% full ride. 

I‚Äôve met countless people who did not finish school but racked up debt at a private university. They chose said private university because that university offered ‚Äúscholarships‚Äù. Such a scam. They make 18 year old kids feel smart for awarding them a scholarship which sounds like a lot.‚Äù ‚ÄúI got a $10,000 scholarship from X University‚Äù but the tuition is $50k a year  so now they‚Äôre paying $40k a year instead of $10k a year at a public university. These schools are predators. Please avoid them. 

I apologize if I offend anyone. But I feel so passionate about this because it‚Äôs ridiculous. There is nothing you will gain at a private university that you won‚Äôt get at a public university. Public universities are $10k a year for tuition and fees. Why would anyone pay more than that, that‚Äôs already ridiculously expensive.

It‚Äôs good that you have this fear of getting into debt. I too had this fear which is why I decided to go to a community college for the first two years, tuition and fees are $3k a year. If you do that for two years you‚Äôll save $14k over those two years in tuition and fees. For the EXACT same credits. 

My advice: don‚Äôt even consider private universities, only public. Go to community college first two years and live at home with parents. 

Most 18 year old kids want to move out of their parents house and live the college life and don‚Äôt want to sacrifice to save money, so they rack up debt to pay for it. If I knew I‚Äôd land a good paying job after university at the time I would‚Äôve done it too. But I was so struck with fear because nothing is promised. There is no promise that you‚Äôll land a job just because you have a degree. That scared me to death so I did what I‚Äôm advising you to do.

For reference I make $75k a year. School was very well worth it. College debt doesn‚Äôt have to be crippling. $3k + $3k + $10k + $10k = $26k. That‚Äôs the price of a car. Judging by the amount of shiny new cars I see on the road every single day, that is not a lot of money to pay for something of value. I‚Äôm only counting tuition and fees because I didn‚Äôt pay for housing. I lived at home with my parents. Which isn‚Äôt the cool thing to do. I hate to be bitter about the situation but 18 year old kids don‚Äôt want to take that route because it isn‚Äôt the extravagant college life everyone raves about.",1577836976

Without knowing exactly which bar you are referring to I can't say this for certain, but it will probably get a lot worse. I have been on numerous shifts where this exact scenario happens, you stretch out your legs to give your balls some room to sweat and get on with it (if you don't have balls, then understand ever time you see a guy making some weird movement with his legs then this is exactly what he is doing). TBH whoever made up the rota might have made a mistake when only you were on the rota, but the time between Christmas and NYE is always a terrible time to write a rota for, and especially in Edinburgh.

Not showing up for your shift the next day basically seals your fate. If you had handed them a letter saying you can't deal with stressful situations during the hiring and induction process then they would at least have maybe tried to stick you on the non-busy shifts.",1577836976

"AmericasSocialists","t5_29l276","I agree with you. I honestly feel as though its american propaganda tho bro. Not just media bullshit. I dont even mean intentional propaganda exclusively, i mean shit like the american dream, everybody just temporarily non-millionaires, education being shit, all of that goes to make people fucking ""pigs"". Im reading a book by Gilles Ch√¢telet called ""to live and think like pigs: the incitement of envy and boredom in market democracies"" and the title alone seems pretty pertinent.

Basically this was by design. If you wanna blame it on ""intelligent design"" that would be poetic considering the free market is supposed to be the battleground of innovation and all the likenings to an actual evolving organism. 

I mean bro most people literally think communism is like the devil. The ONLY info most people get on it is literal propaganda. Most are so ignorant that they literally couldnt tell you a single thing about, the tenants, its founder(s) (or anyone involved with it besides besides maybe stalin and incorrectly the nazis). Most people think cuba is a hellhole despite it being like 100m off the coast.

My point is, is that americans are a special breed of stupid, isolates idiots. We are focused on the individual rather that the collective. We get offended by everything. I saw on nhk earlier this Chinese group of friends, like in their 40s, mostly strongly independent women who were having trouble marrying (that was the specific story) but this man was just giving them the harsh truth and i mean telling them straight up what the problem was no sugar coatingm a convo like that in america woulve ended in a fight. When honestly they were just helping each other out.

I dont think china is a utopia lmfao. Just an example of differing attitudes among our cultures. I know theyre have been studies done on this too, people born and growing up in societies that value the collective literally think differently than americans and the like.

But the tide is starting to change my dude. Im in oklahoma and it was just different when i was younger and im only 28. Weve got along way to go but there is hope for it to change. Our economy is built on the backs of lots of other countries, and protests are going on around the world. The internet is helping the working class around the world achieve some semblance of solidarity. Literally impossible a few decades ago. People are starting to wake up. My generation and the zoomers are a lot more left leaning. And i mean actually to the left. But our history us practically devoid of leftist parties and with what happened to the black panthers and mlk and malcom x, shows that tbe usa will fight back. But i have hope.",1577836977

And yeah it does, but the loan amount can still be no more than 95% of the *property* value including the LMI, so to get that same property we need the difference between the net loan amount (total loan subtract LMI premium) and property in cash - which is now 5% + LMI (+ all other fees and expenses). And LMI ain't small at 5% deposit

So turns out our mates either had no LMI because rich parents, or their deposit was 10% on paper but *effectively* it was like 6-7% because the LMI pushed that LVR above 90%. Problem being that we are already on the LVR ceiling with asking for 95%

The percentage of coal power used to power a Tesla is obviously dependent on the area and what types of energy sources are used to power the electrical grid.  Even in the worst case scenario, though, of 100% coal used to power the grid, it's still more efficient.  That's because even the most efficient vehicle gas engines are really inefficient.

Battery components *are* an issue, but not a serious one.  Difficult battery components (cobalt) are getting phased out as battery technology improves, and the amount of CO2 released mining the needed components is nowhere near the amount of CO2 saved by the increase in electric vehicles on the road.  Also, the need for mining battery components will be highly reduced by battery recycling.  

The fact is, vehicle emissions are one of the leading causes of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  Something needs to be done to change that, and electric vehicles are the clear solution.  Cringy statements like ""Buuuuuuuut It'S ElEcTrIiiiiIIIIiic!!!!!!"" really showcase the kind of dismissive attitude that prevents actual progress on this issue.",1577836981

"detroitlions","t5_2rynx","I'm not mister Stats are dumb, you have to watch the game, but football also isn't near as stat driven as something like baseball. If you are burning through a HC every two years, you will burn through a lot of bad coaches that go on to do nothing and justify your method. But you might also lose out on Bill Belichick, who had a losing season his first 3 seasons, and in 4 of his first 5.

We always talk about how bad for a young QB's development it is when they have a new OC every couple years, why don't we apply that to the HC? How is a team supposed to develop into a contender if you don't give the HC more than a couple years to do it? Some guys don't need that long, great for you if you found one, but some guys do.

I guess the Ravens don't have too much to complain about considering how they've done since firing Bill Belichick, but do you think they've ever wondered what if they'd kept him? Obviously Bill is an extreme example, there may never be another Bill.

Legal gun ownership directly correlates with reduced crime in an area.

All gun laws target legal gun owners and not criminals.

Most gun laws have no effect on statistics and when Obama wanted to open up background checks (a proven law that does works) he was cockblocked by the democratic party due to how it will ""discriminate"" against African Americans.

 Gun deaths are grossly [over exaggerated](https://i.imgur.com/Rs5i4KO.jpg), media likes to toss aroun 30,000-60,000 people dying annually but something like 65 to 70% of that is suicide.

Lastly I have the knowledge on how to build a fully automatic belt fed(no reloads) dealer of death in my garage, no law can stop that. If I ever became deranged and crazy and came in to say a church to shoot it up, the best way to stop me would be a culture of legal carrying law abiding citizens.


Edit: Here is a Joe Rogan podcast that goes over all these points and more, Joe came in anti gun let's stop mass shootings and after seeing the data was like wtf is even the media.

The problem with that lower cost of living and housing is that for the average established adult moving to a high cost of living area is a major step down in several quality of life factors, such as housing. Even if your salary adjusts generously to account for the difference in cost of living the odds are your $250k 2,500 sq. ft. 4 bed 3 bath two car garage house is going to turn into a $500k 1000 sq. ft. 2 bed 1.5 bath no garage house, or even worse an apartment.

"Paranormal","t5_2qjxn","First,
""I have this bizarre dream. I think it was a dream. In my dream, I wake up in what seems like reality. I walk up off my bed and I see myself still lying down. I dismiss this, as I had to pee. I thought I was just losing it. I head to the bathroom and it feels so, so sticky. Like just the walk there took so much effort. Like I was walking through a heavy wind but there was no wind or something.""

This is astral projection.
It's where your spiritual self leaves your body while your physical stays where it is
To someone new, it would feel weird like that.

Second, 
""I see this shadow there. Like, it is a silhouette of a person, but it‚Äôs 3D and is tangible. It had white yes and it looks at me slowly. The eyes were more like flashlights instead of actual eyes (meaning it was too bright to see a pupil). It jumps at me and pins me down in the hallway next to the bathroom door. I freak out but not too much. It starts seeping on to me, like dry ice smoke slipping on the floor. As it fades into me, it says that its power is now mine and my power is now it‚Äôs and that we are one in and of the same, or something along those lines.""

It could be a shadow person since it was in the astral world, it could be any number of things. 

Third, 
As for dreams, they sound more like precog moments. They can happen while asleep or awake.
As for what you write or say coming true kind of, that could be true, it could also be you predicting and writing it, then it happens.

Fourth,
Whoever is there is now a part of you, as it did merge with your spiritual self.

Fifth, 
""I have this dream where I am someone else and I am getting burnt (I‚Äôm not sure where). Anyway, I wake up with a sunburn on my face. Keep in mind ITS WINTER right now and I live in a cloudy area. Not only that, but I was inside. Like how does that happen? Then while I take a shower, I kind of fall asleep for one second, but then I wake up and it feels like I am someone else. Like I can‚Äôt hear anything, but it looked like I felt like I was someone else. I looked at my hands and they were different colors, and I touched my hair and it was much longer. Then I wake up from it.""

This sounds like past lives.

You could also be waking up spiritually. An Awakening, it happens and everyone's experience is different.

Some, like myself, are born awake. Meaning that I always knew, my spiritual self was never asleep.

I'm an Occultist, Daimonologist (non-religious), Daimonolatress, and Necromancer. Been practicing my entire life, basically. Only been practicing Necromancy for the last almost 2 years.
I work with Daimon's (known as Demon's), a few Angles, and a multitude of other spirits.
I honestly enjoy the added benefits they share with me.

"science","t5_mouw","This is a major point that people are missing. In primary and secondary school you're there to be taught. You're expected to have the knowledge passed to you by your previous teacher and thats it. They will sit you down and they'll hold your hand through the process to teach you what you need to know.

I went through my commercial pilots license and it was the same as a college or university, you're expected to be learning the material on your own and your instructor/professor time is there to address nuance and anything that might need refining from the learning materials. If I had shown up to any of my lectures or flights without a sound knowledge of what it was all about then my instructor would have been pissed as hell and I would have ultimately failed the course.

I can't believe that there are people in this thread who claim to have been to/are at college or university that still hold the belief they should be sat down and taught start to finish. By the time you're out of high school it's on you to learn. Your college or uni is providing you access to experts in the fields you're studying, not babysitters and primary teachers. They're there to expand on the learning material where its needed and field questions, it's not possible for them to walk 50+ people through the materials day by day.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think you're still thinking of war back in the 3rd generation (WWII / Blitzkrieg), whereas today we're mostly living in 4th gen [1] conflicts. It's all about the country's will to fight and what state of living are they willing to accept.

In Afghanistan, neither the US or USSR were able to decisively defeat their enemy and have legitimate control over the entire nation-state and its territory - i.e. our goal. So all of our fancy weapons weren't super relevant to defeating a determined enemy with small arms fighting on home turf with close ties/trust to locals throughout their society.

The closest modern example would be the IRA [1] using force to gain negotiating power against the UK to get a seat at the table of power. Even though this didn't achieve their goals of an independant N. Ireland, they were not decisively defeated by tanks and air strikes because their decentralized nature made this kind of force irrelevant.

In conclusion, it is possible for an IRA-like force to exist in the USA and have some manner of political influence - i.e. achieve some of their goals, even if a holding action.

This would scare the shit out of me, but as was mentioned above the French resistance didn't really achieve much, but I would say that it's because they knew the Allies would eventually win and their lives weren't horrible, so their will to overcome by themselves was less. Flash back to the first Napoleonic wars and you'll see Frenchmen fighting for freedom when they were starving due to a corrupt / broken government, so they had great will to succeed.

I'm very happy to have Enkidu because he's a best clay. I think he was the 2nd servant to be final ascended just because his ascension material took me too long to gather. His final ascension art is so nice as well. And I just love his background story and his relationship with Gil. Still working on maxing out his skills and giving him Fous whenever I can. Not sure if I'll give him grails yet because I'm saving them for Jalter in the future. 

Not too happy with my starter sr Tama-cat and I didn't know I could reroll. Pretty happy with Martha because her voice is so gooooood. Not too happy with Emiya assassin and Assassin of Paraiso just because they weren't my targets.  

I don't really have a solid team comp yet and I really lack in calvary classes so hoping that will change this upcoming year. Also been saving my quartz for Jalter.

Like I've said in another comment, when it comes to other SW content - she has been critical of Rogue One, Solo, and the Galaxy girls brand. Beyond that, she also has said negative things about a few other Disney properties. 

I do not understand how you think she has been contradictory to her ""brand"" when that isn't the case *at all*.

&gt;No, I'm focused on her building up a specific persona for her brand.

Her being a woman doesn't add to her personality. That's *you* adding onto it in bad faith as if she is doing a specific personality *around* being a woman.

Impurities cause the ice to freeze at a lower temperature. When ice freezes from all around, the impurities get pushed to the center, where directional freezing pushes them out from the last part of the ice to freeze.

This all said, even if you boil distilled water and freeze it in a frypan, the ice will still create foggyness, unless frozen linearly, this is because ice expands when it freezes. Freeze water in a sealed bottle with no air and the bottle will cracke/explode. Freeze water in a cannonball and the cannonball will crack. Put the cannon ball inside a sealed cannon and the ball and the cannon will crack. If the vessel containing the ice is not sealed, the ice will internally shatter and form a volcano like structure. 

When water freezes, it must expand, either by distroying the vessel is is frozen in or through the ice itself seeking relief. With directional chilling, the ice is generally harvested while water still exists in the ice making vessel.",1577836992

"NoFapChristians","t5_2ysnf","You're going to feel really great by moving through this. We build strength by walking through our urges instead of giving in to them. Here are some ideas:

**D**elay

**E**scape

**A**void

**D**istract

**S**ubstitute

**Delay** means to just put off reacting, using, or giving in to the craving for a bit of time and know that the urge will go away. That strong emotion will go away. Even if you can delay for 5-10 minutes, that¬†may change the experience you have with the emotion and thus make you better able to handle it. How often have we done something on impulse and later regretted it?

**Escape** means removing yourself from the situation that is triggering you. Leave the argument. Take a pause. Leave the house knowing that you can‚Äôt be around it. 

**Avoid** situations you know can be triggering. 

**Distract** means  you can take control of the urge by getting busy. Don‚Äôt just sit there and ruminate on the urge, but put your focus on something else. For some people that may be art, for some it could be just watching TV, reading a book, walking, showering, or exercising, which can be particularly helpful if you‚Äôre triggered into anger. Put something else in your life to distract yourself from¬†those things that can be triggering.

**Substitute** your behavior. If you're having issues with urges, substitute a walk as your new behavior. The trick is to come up with something that can be easily substituted in place of the old behavior.",1577836992

My understanding (my interest dropped off a cliff right around the same time as the Japanese audience it seems, so im not too versed in the later seasons) is the people couldnt keep up with his unique art and choreography style, and while they got a bigger budget all they did was make it 'prettier' and more mainstream looking and it completely lost its soul.

Also didnt help that they didnt seem to have a strong grasp on the characters and so seemingly let their own biases and politics take over and make them skin deep pandering charicatures of what they actually were and were intended to be (the new showrunners also seemed to listen waaay too much to the overly vocal Tumblr-style parts of the fanbase).

This is just my personal take so take it with a grain of salt. Anyone else feel free to chime in as well and either disagree completely or tell me in which parts i might be off base.",1577836994

"CAguns","t5_31iwc","IANAL, but this part jumps out at me:

&gt;The firearm is kept . . . in a location that a reasonable person would believe to be secure.

I would hope that your home qualifies as a space you can reasonably believe to be secure, provided that you lock your doors and don't post signs saying ""Please steal my guns"" on the door.

But I believe the exemptions in 25105 are secondary to the definition given in 25100:
&gt;You know or reasonably should know that . . . a person prohibited from possessing a firearm or deadly weapon pursuant to state or federal law is likely to gain access to the firearm.

Since you live alone, you have a reasonable belief that when your door is locked, no one but you has access to your home, and by extension your firearms.  I don't think it is reasonable to put the burden on you for a criminal breaking in.

But as you've noted, the law doesn't specify the little details for prohibited persons, so you might be in the unenviable position of getting a lawyer and setting court precedents should things go poorly.",1577836994

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","Not to beat a dead horse but as a Jew-by-choice there's so additional info I can add.

Any kids will after to convert after the age of 18 which is a very expensive (hundreds of dollars in many cases) and very long (actual years, plural) process. That's probably why it matters so much to him, it would be extremely difficult for your children to convert. People also often have to move in order to do it, especially for orthodox since you can't drive to services. 

All that said, if you don't want to be Jewish do not convert. It will be a ton of money and years of your life for something you don't want, and rabbis will sniff out that you aren't genuine and likely make you stop the process.

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","I actually used to be pretty close friends with a trans woman. For the purpose of this post, I'm going to use they/them pronouns. I can't bring myself to use male pronouns for this person, because I only knew them well into their transition, they actually passed quite well, and they're just a very sweet person.

Anyway, like I said, we used to be pretty close. Last year they had SRS. Our friend group had heard from their girlfriend after the surgery that they were in quite a bit of pain, which was to be expected. As the weeks went by, we continued to get updates that they were struggling with their recovery, and continued to be in a lot of pain. I personally reached out to check in, and wasn't getting much response in return.

Months went by and I continued checking in periodically, just to say hello, or I miss you, or just what's up, how's it going. I'd either get no response or just something very brief. Eventually, quite a bit of time had gone by and I sent a message essentially saying, hi, hope you're well, miss chatting! And they responded saying hello, I forget what else, just sounding vague and sad.

And nothing since, that was quite awhile back. Before I ended up peaking. I of course still wish them well. 

But my point is, I have to think that sudden drop off in communication is related to their surgery. I wonder what happened. I suspect something went terribly wrong and they were too upset to tell anyone. I'll always wonder. And if that's the case I feel awful. They were so excited about it too. I had no idea at the time what it really entailed. I wonder if they were informed.",1577836996

OU was better of course, but Baker elevated them and was given a playbook that worked with his skill set. They were a really good team, but an unreal offense without a defense. Why we are not just taking the OU playbook (or something thereof) and running the thing makes no sense to me. It's like all the curls we ran in the rain in Cincy, when no one could stay on their feet.

I am a full on Baker fan that jumped to the Browns bandwagon 100%, and I admit was really worried about him getting drafted there and misused by Hue...Then it was injured because of Robinson and Hubbard and an o-line that cannot hold water in a bucket...Now I am fearful that they are going to screw him over with mayhem in the front office that has him wanting to leave.

Obviously, we don‚Äôt know the details. Maybe she does feel bad. Maybe she‚Äôll eventually come forward. But for now, her actions remind me of people I know who are the unapologetic, *sucks-for-you,* *sorry-not-sorry* types.

Sorry for the rant. I‚Äôve seen people like OPs ‚Äúfriend‚Äù walk away without recourse and it really fucking makes me mad. They‚Äôre the always the victim, never the robber folk who plunder yet cry when karma comes around.

I see both sides. Yes we need to help people on the streets. I agree with the principal that if you give people a roof over his or her head it makes it easier for them to solve the problems that led to them being on the street.

However about 1 third of my pay goes to taxes and 1 third goes to my rent. That gives me 1 third for the rest of my spending. Many people are in a similar situation. I understand why it's frustrating when i go to work and am paying to put a roof over these people's heads.

Curtis doesn't push an agenda; there's never some lame, ambiguous ""call-to-action"" with him that results in no action but a lot of blogging, podcasts, and Adam Curtis Style Documentaries-- maybe occasionally donning a black bandana and screeching at police.



&gt;dude talks about how capitalism is heading into an economic and political crisis so severe that only the most destructive war in human history might be able to restore profitability, as in the 20th Century.

I witnessed the entire Nessa controversy and I don't even follow Pokemon fans. 

With Tumblr, the tagging system is a literal godsend. Are you tried of hearing people who think rabies is a sexuality? Mute that shitty tag. Are people making cutesy, UWU pastel accounts dedicated to serial killers and school shooters? Blocked, out of my life forever.

2. Maybe the CSA problem is way more prevalent with the Watchtower. The CC, only has a CSA problem with their priests; with the Jehovah's Witnesses, the problem extends all the way down to the most ""regular"" member.

and contributed to the project.  But I've grown up.

&gt;  You dont even know what the hell Lollypop ...

Lollypop is simply the latest GNOME music player.  I happen to like that it's python (with dependencies on stable libs) ... but it's otherwise unremarkable.   It's been around for 4 or 5 years, it is certainly not a ""killer application"", and it certainly works fine on Plasma.",1577836999

"Granblue_en","t5_3e3se","&gt; I don't have any Grand character but I doubt their lines differ from their regular selves (SSR or SR for story characters).

They have the same seasonal dialogue lines as the story versions, yes.  
In fact, the story Grands are *disadvantaged* during certain seasonal campaigns (compared to story versions) because they don't use the cut-in CG that story characters can sometimes get -- particularly Valentines, the whole ""closeup chocolate gift with pink bubbles and sparkle effects"" scene is skipped for their Grand versions.  
Not a big deal since everyone will have the story versions and can just check those instead.

-----

School Korwa is a delusion, rather than a different time period like the others you mentioned, just for clarity.  

-----

Like you say, seasonals don't get new dialogue versions in their respective seasons. In fact, some (but far from all) characters with valid seasonals may even change into their seasonal outfit (or paid skin) to give the seasonal lines, even if you don't have it.  
[Edit: But I'm glad for it, I mean. It would feel pretty bad for a ""better"" seasonal line to be locked behind the limited character version. Thankfully, it's clear that other dialogue variations occur because they make sense (or are ""needed"") from a story/logic standpoint; it's not being done as a moneygrab/selling point.]

-----

Sara is an odd one, as even her event SR version has the same lines, despite very noticeable physical and mental growth between event SR Sara / SSR Earth Sara+SR summer Sara / SSR Light Sara.  
But I suppose it could just be a VA scheduling issue rather than an oversight, or like you say, perhaps they feel it was not significant enough to warrant bringing the VA in for more lines.",1577836999

"PhoenixPoint","t5_3d84q","1. TBH this is a pretty neglible increase to cost. The vast bulk of the cost is the soldier. Idk why soldiers cost nearly as much as ground vehicles and around 40% as much as aircraft.
2. 2. Nine times out of ten its a six person squad. I'm comparing it to OG-coms squads of 14 to 26 because the game plays closer to OG-com then it does to new xcom. 8 is tiny if you can be murdered from off screen with no telegraphed counterplay.
3. They do but they both out number you and spawn more spread out over the map. They can start with guys who have spotted your squad and preventing you from advancing AND guys deeper into the map with snipers. The only time you have that same dynamic is in base defences. Even then its far from equivalent because campaign wise they have infinite soldiers and you have extremely limited numbers.  


Please don't assume I'm less experienced than you. And all the dynamics I'm talking about are actually worse in late game. Soldiers aren't appreciably all that much tougher and are still vulnerable to out of sight attacks, you can't kill or control every enemy you encounter even late game given that you are both outnumbered and individual enemies require multiple soldiers/rage burst to kill. And the fact that you need high level abilities to stand a chance makes losing even one even more punitive.",1577836999

Make sure your dad knows that he isn‚Äôt the issue and is always welcome.  

That‚Äôs it.  Don‚Äôt engage in an argument or even a discussion.  Your mother is an alcoholic.  Tell her your kids don‚Äôt need to see it.  They don‚Äôt need to see codependent behavior or enabling either. 

When you visit her you are saying it is okay to be drunk around you and the kids.  It is not!  You are saying your brother‚Äôs crazy views are okay.  You said in the post that they are not.  

Cancel.  Be pleasant and cheerful like the truth doesn‚Äôt hurt, though it does.  Don‚Äôt engage her and don‚Äôt expect them to change.  That‚Äôs on them.  Your honesty and unwillingness to go there maybe the only motivation they ever get to change.  And it still may not help.  But you and your kids will be so much better for this!",1577837002

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In Kim's defense I highly doubt she expected to be famous for fucking a celebrity. 

It's not like she could see so far ahead that the game was rigged from the start. She just got lucky and capitalized on it. Lo and behold, a Star is born! Who wouldn't take advantage of that and milk that cow as much as possible? 

I'm going to let you in on something you idiots in this echo chamber don't seem to realize: Hating someone makes them famous and that usually works in their favor like it did for Kim, Trump and Justin bieber.

The second thing you need to know is that you need to stop roasting celebrities for upvotes. Getting your 15 minutes of fame at someone else's expense just validates their superiority over you. And if this hive mind is doing the same thing then that person who is a target of a hate group is worth more than them. 

But don't take my word for it. This post shows that Reddit has self-esteem issues.

"EatCheapAndHealthy","t5_2vvpi","- 3 chicken breasts, cut in half and marinated ($8.50 BOGO)
- Great value Italian marinade (.87¬¢)
- 1 bag frozen cauliflower ($1.15)
- 1 bag frozen broccoli ($1)
- 4 Garlic cloves, minced 
- Red pepper flakes
- Paprika 
- Salt
- Pepper

Marinade chicken for 3-6 hours in desired amount of marinade (I used 1/3 bottle). Preheat oven to 425. Pre-steam vegetables in microwave, drain excess water. Place veg and minced garlic on foil lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Place chicken breast slices over veg and bake for 16-20 minutes until chicken comes to temp. ( I baked for 18.) 4-6 servings

Optional- brush chicken with oil and paprika and attempt to broil for color. Didnt work great but the paprika was delicious and the chicken didn‚Äôt dry out. 

Rice Pilaf 
- 1 cup rice
- 1/3 cup orzo
- 1 carrot, chopped 
- 1 green onion, sliced 
- 1 garlic clove, minced 
- Salt and pepper
- Knor chicken broth powder, to taste 
- Oil
- 1 3/4 water 

Toast orzo in oil until browned. Add rice and toast lightly. Add veg, reserving green parts of green onion for later. Add spices then water. Simmer for 15 minutes. Once it‚Äôs done, add green parts after fluffing.

"HobbyDrama","t5_k4fie","My sister is into lolita and loves Venus, she talks about it all the time so I kinda know what's up. Dang, that's crazy. I know it doesn't justify it, but the age of consent is 13 in Japan so that explains how he got away with it. I just wonder what else was going on within Bodyline to where everybody actually stayed there and helped organize this crap at the time - I woulda gone on strike. EDIT: Actually now that I think about it, that age of consent probably makes it more socially acceptable there to try and get a lolita waifu, and as another user pointed out (that I forgot), people in Japan are very dedicated to their jobs and try to be good workers that don't ask questions so...

I think it's worth mentioning that Bodyline saying those things about Venus was just Bodyline covering themselves. Just throwing shade to make her seem like the bad guy instead of themselves. That point isn't exactly clear in the OP - unless it wasn't intended to be there.

EDIT: also it's unfair that some of the lolita community was mad at Venus. Everyone should know that My Strange Addiction is a joke and that lolita isn't a bad thing, but I guess maybe some people took it too seriously. Some non-lolitas thought lolita was a joke and so the lolitas blamed Venus. Not really her fault.",1577837003

The issue is the dance itself, and if this boundary was established beforehand. This type of suggestive dancing or ""grinding"" is really dependent on cultural and sub cultural differences. Some people just hate any and all sexually suggestive dancing, even things like salsas. Some people think all close dancing is sexual in nature, and that really should be something that's discussed instead of assumed.

OP, does she dance like that often? With others? Before or during your relationship? Did you ever bring this up before?",1577837004

"TrumpGamers","t5_28tyur","Ur mom, and Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.

Contents: Section 1: In Pornography Section 2: Ball stretcher Section 3: Parachute Section 4: Humbler Section 5: Testicle cuff

Section 1: In pornography

In addition to it‚Äôs occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (literally Ball kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.

Section 2: Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds.

Section 3: Parachute

A Parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and squeezing effects on the man‚Äôs testicles. Moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.

Section 4: Humbler

A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Section 5: Testicle cuff

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.

Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.

However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm.",1577837004

Really, you just ... drink coffee.  Try lots of different coffees, different roasts, maybe brews at cafes that you don't have at home.    And all the while, follow your nose through what seems interesting, putting diligence and dedication into the things that seem or feel significant to you.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Yes... The long story is: 

  

I have been battling constant errors for the past couple of months and it has gotten worst. It starts when I try to log in. It takes a longer time than normal to log in. Sometimes I will get to the character screen and other times it will just lock up.. If I do get to the character screen after waiting a long time and I select a character then the screen normally goes completely dark and I wait again for an extreme amount of time. Sometimes I will load in but most times I get kick with an error code Watercress and then I have to quit the game and try again. Taking like 10-15 minutes each try.. If some how I do get in normally I can only play 1 activity or location before getting a NEWT error when trying to switch activities or locations. It seems like I can play all I want on a planet doing patrols and bounties. I can even fast travel with no issues but if I try to go to the tower or another planet then I get the error NEWT about 70% of the time and gets higher the longer I have been playing. If I do a strike/crucible playlist and just stay in matchmaking after the activity I am normally ok but If I quit out after the match and try to relaunch it I will get a NEWT error.. Being in a fireteam in party chat makes the chance of the game just freezing or getting an error worst. It really makes it hard to play the game and do everything I want to do in the game. 

Troubleshoot steps so far. 

I have reset the Xbox1 and Modem/Router (Multiple times daily for the past couple months) 

I have uninstalled the game and reinstalled the game 

I have returned the Xbox1 to factory standards and removed all games/apps and reinstalled 

I have removed my Xbox Live GT from the Xbox and reinstalled it 

I am hard wired to my modem 

I have had my cable lines checked out twice from the cable company and they even replaced the modem with a new one. 

I have played other games with no issues 

I pulled out my old Xbox and tried the game on that Xbox with the same issues 

I have made a new Xbox Live GT and played Destiny2 for about a couple hours with ZERO issues so it seems like it is just my main GT (OldAngryShrek) 

I have messed around with different DNS Settings with no changes 

My network stats are the following: 

Download Speed: 613Mbps 

Upload Speed: 28Mbps 

Packets Loss: 0% 

MTU: 1480 

Latency: 59ms

NAT: Open 

I had a friend a couple towns over try my GT(OldAngryShrek) on their network / Xbox and they had the SAME ISSUES. 

Conclusion: I am at a lost. It seems like my GT(OldAngryShrek) has issues changing activities in the game. Can this be a server issue or something else on your side Bungie? Can you investigate this please!!!! Other GTs work fine on my Xbox and my GT still doesnt work on other people's Xbox. I talked to XBOX Live Support for other 3 hours and they checked everything on their side and say it is good. I am in good standings and everything is the way it should be. I want to play my game that I have spent over 5 years playing going back to D1 Beta. Please help out this loyal customer.",1577837006

Go for it in the split second moment throughout the day when your mind truly can believe that not smoking is the way to go. I know we all pretty much have that moment as a smoker when we get a flash in our mind at a random point throughout the day where we truly feel ""damn, what the hell am I doing being a smoker?"". Use the power of that feeling as a step stool and boom throw the pack away and from there it is onward and upward. Take care of yourselves and don't beat yourself up through the cravings, but you must hold yourself to some sort of standard in order to make it at least until the physical cravings go away.

I think this year's tweaks of the strategies impacting the make up of your team are fucking deadly.  It's made online play more transparent and fun. 

It's improved to the point that if you actually have hockey IQ and are knowledgeable about systems and tactics..  you can slay at this game.

The sheer fact I can actually emulate the real life Blues and Islanders tactic of ""puck placement"" with dumping the puck and getting great chances against good players that simply was not possible last year is amazing.

Honestly if players are getting beat by clowns that try the usual exploits, it's on you to get your defence play in order.

IM sincerely enjoying the massive improvments of the strategies actually working. Even cooler IMO,  is that there's so many different cards that work well with certain strategy combos and styles.

For instance...that 85 Icon Andreychuck will feel like a shit card if you are set up to score off the rush. If you have a handle on how players behave using behind net/overload he is a fucking mutant that can help you grind along the walls.

You like to run and gun score off the rush?! Then you must own that gold base McJesus. Plays identical to the real thing. 

It's sad so many folks here deflect their inherently bad play on EA delivering a shit game.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; To help clarify my understanding, if you feel I‚Äôm ignorant of the second amendment explain it to me so I could understand it‚Äôs meaning.

Hmm, there's so much material on this going back a few centuries. The original intent, as far as the founding fathers were concerned, was that the Second Amendment is designed to enumerate restrictions on the Federal government so as to not infringe on our right to bear arms.

There is a lot of correspondence from that time period where you see a distrust in the government - specifically that citizens (and the states) have a duty to protect themselves from tyranny, as well as the nation. They wanted citizens to be armed so that they could stand up to tyrannical governments and threats. Mostly through the use of militias.

Now, obviously we've grown as a country and standing armies have taken over the duties of the militia, but that does not mean the Second Amendment is invalid. The founding fathers warned us about standing armies and the government getting too much power - specifically through military means. But they were very clear - the citizenry must be armed to keep the balance of power.

&gt; I know all Americans have the right to bear arms, and I‚Äôm not banning them. I‚Äôm saying that greater restrictions would assist in preventing gun violence. By preventing people who shouldn‚Äôt have a gun to get one.

Look, no one on the pro-gun side wants those who shouldn't have guns to have them. You can ask any legal gun owner and get the same response - criminals and those who want to cause harm should not have firearms. The crux of this issue is that many of the laws/ideas that are proposed by gun control advocates are being proposed based on *emotion* and *perception*, and generally only affect those that are law-abiding in the first place. This is all under the guise of ""common sense"" gun control.

For example - universal background checks. These are comprised of two components:

1. Requiring background checks for all purchases/transfers including private sales
2. Restricting the sale/possession of firearms due to mental health issues.

If you look at the data from the FBI/BJS, and Chicago's own reports on the sources of firearms you will see that *legal* private sales and gun shows account for less than 2% of gun crime at the most. Yet, we have this extreme push to close the ""gun show loophole"" via universal background checks. Gun owners, for the most part, are not selling their firearms to criminals. What's also concerning is the push to continuously stigmatize those with any sort of mental health disorder from exercising their rights. While I agree that those who show signs of instability/violence/aggression should be banned, I do believe it should be handled through the court and require evaluation with a judge (i.e. due process).

Just want to note that many gun owners would *love* the ability to conduct background checks for private sales and firearms transfers without having to be forced through a dealer or the police, but as of such it is not allowed due to the current legislation.

&gt; To clarify on the point of 10 bullets, this is useful to prevent mass shootings. In the event a shooter gets a gun and fires upon a crowd, the less bullets he has the more he needs to reload. In that case, it gives anyone underfire to get cover and police to close in. 

Banning ""assault weapons"" based on cosmetic/ergonomic features, restricting magazine capacity, bump stocks, and things like this do nothing to alleviate gun violence. It's getting to the point where the new governor of Virginia wants to ban practically 95% of all semi-automatic weapons based on *his* definition of an ""assault firearm"". Per the new legislation he proposes, an ""assault firearm"" is defined, in part, as:

*""A semi-automatic center-fire rifle that expels single or multiple projectiles by action of an explosion of a combustible material that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has one of the following characteristics:""*

* (i) a folding or telescoping stock
* (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the rifle
* (iii) a thumbhole stock
* (iv) a second handgrip or a protruding grip that can be held by the non-trigger hand
* (v) a bayonet mount
* (vi) a grenade launcher
* (vii) a flare launcher
* (viii) a silencer
* (ix) a flash suppressor
* (x) a muzzle brake
* (xi) a muzzle compensator
* (xii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting (a) a silencer, (b) a flash suppressor, (c) a muzzle brake, or (d) a muzzle compensator
* (xiii) any characteristic of like kind as enumerated in clauses (i) through (xii)

This would effectively ban the sale and ownership of nearly all semi-automatic rifles, and hand guns, and a significant number of shotguns. Even bolt-action rifles would fall under this definition since most of them are magazine-fed, and have threaded barrels. Furthermore, the bill states that:

*""Assault firearm"" includes any part or combination of parts designed or intended to convert, modify, or otherwise alter a firearm into an assault firearm, or any combination of parts that may be readily assembled into an assault firearm.""* 

As well as...

*It is unlawful for any person to import, sell, manufacture, purchase, possess, or transport an assault firearm. A violation of this section shall be is punishable as a Class 6 felony.*

So this means that just *having* these components in my possession renders me a felon. By my count currently I would rack up about 10 or 12 felony charges on accessories alone. **None of these components or restrictions will affect gun violence. But this would make me and hundreds of thousands of others, felons.**

&gt; This is already a law in California to confirm its effectiveness.

This has not been proven anywhere. There is no correlation between magazine capacity and the effectiveness of a shooter. 

In quite a few instances the shooter(s) didn't even empty their magazines and instead reloaded after 10 - 15 rounds. In two instances I can remember off of the top of my head, high-capacity AR-15 magazines (60 or 100-round drums) were used and effectively jammed. High-capacity magazines are notoriously prone to jams.

Charles Whitman killed 18 people with a bolt-action rifle. The guy who did the Las Vegas shooting would have killed more people if he had used a bolt-action rifle too. The fact that he used a bumpstock and similar methods to increase his rate of fire from the distance he shot into the crowd was one of the things that saved a lot of lives. Using a bolt-action rifle and more powerful rounds (.338 Lapua or .300 Winchester Magnum) would have resulted in significantly more death.",1577837008

Limited Asian media representation and unchallenged stereotypes don't do much to widen the perspective. Shuugo, the male VA here, is a bit brown, but the ladies are light-skinned. All the same, like how you assume anime characters are white, in Japan, both creators and audience assume anime characters to be Japanese, and implicitly confirm or change this assumption based on the information provided - it could be right from the creators themselves who may specify it, or perhaps the biographical details of an individual that the story provides. Maybe it could be cultural/social, based on names, how people interact, or how the environment may look. Depending on the presentation and context, especially if there might be a means in limiting the means of presentation, it's entirely possible for a Japanese person to watch an American show, and assume the character(s) to be Japanese.

"macbookpro","t5_2xhss","You‚Äôre exactly right. Macs have been for content creators for the longest time. Historically that content was video, still images, publishing, etc. 

But, there seems to be a convergence on what types of tools content creators require and the hardware that high end games - including VR games - require, and those tools for serious content creators are starting to look a lot like high-end gaming PCs. 

My test with the Mac Pro 2013 was very interesting since the dual GPU was very capable when rendering of 3D scenes (albeit without the right software you‚Äôre stuck with CPU rendering), but the GPU was running at such a low clock speed that the frame rates required for VR just weren‚Äôt there.

The Mac in general is a great place for content creators. And 3D virtual worlds experienced in a VR headset is where content is being consumed - more each day. The Mac needs to be capable of creating content for that medium, or they will miss a growing opportunity - AR as well as VR. (Apple clearly is moving in that direction with ARKit, RealityKit, Reality Composer, and support for 360 video in FCP via VR headset playback, etc.)

I‚Äôd love to see some parity in the VR titles offered between Mac and PC - Unity and Unreal Engine should be able to help with this, but we haven‚Äôt seen tons of progress... yet. 

I‚Äôll hold out hope. 

 I love my MacBook Pro. Love macOS. And I love the idea of high end content creation and high end content consumption being possible on the same machine.",1577837010

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","&gt;It sounds like you're taking issue with the fact that putting more time into something means that you can be better at it.

I think you've mispegged me greatly. It seems like it stems from the idea that you're a supporter of emergent elements like bunny hopping and so you've labeled me as noncompetitive. Let me try to clarify my point of view.

This is *exactly* why I play games. I've been around a top 1000 player in Counter-Strike and Modern Warfare 2 and have played more League of Legends than I care to admit trying to get better (sadly less successfully). This is where I find the fun and joy in games as well, and why I'm currently playing a ton of Apex Legends.

I am also definitely not against emergent gameplay, but there is healthy emergent gameplay and unhealthy emergent gameplay. Which is which is obviously somewhat subjective, but I'll quote /r/Seantommy 's answer above as I think it perfectly gives my opinion on the subject:

&gt;Games are designed to be engaging. If the developer sees that the majority of their players (i.e. ""casuals"") don't understand a mechanic or can't interact with it properly, that's a red flag that the mechanic is either unintuitive, overly complex, improperly balanced, or something along those lines. If an awkward or poorly conveyed mechanic is hard to learn and provides a massive advantage, it's going to be seen as unfair by newer or more casual players who aren't able to do it.

To me there is another judge of a mechanic, which is, is this mechanic fun because it adds a fun element to the gameplay for everyone, or is it fun because 1. it required growth or learning to master and 2. provides an advantage to those who master it. Many times elements that are not inherently fun become fun for a few because of the mastery and advantage they provide, which I would argue is *not* good emergent gameplay. You can have emergent gameplay that is *both* inherently fun and requires growth and mastery and depth to master.

An example is timers in League of Legends. A lot of players were very upset when they added them because some people had learned to count or use an external timer that gave them an advantage and they felt they were removing this layer of skill from the game. But is keeping track of timers in your head really fun apart from the game? For most people, no, but it was something required of you if you wanted to play at the highest level. So they removed that element and the game was more fun for it. You could focus on learning and growing in other more enjoyable ways.

Bunny hopping is similar to me. Is using your mouse wheel instead of the much more natural spacebar and constantly bouncing around in a way that makes your screen nauseating to watch inherently fun? To me, it just adds a ridiculous, almost comical element to a game, but you have to learn it to be competitive in some games and it's a lot of fun to utilize it when it gives you a strong advantage and makes you feel like a god once you've mastered it. I'd rather the bunny hopping be patched out and then you can focus on more inherently fun emergent elements that don't fundamentally alter the core intended gameplay. Watching a skilled bunnyhopper in something like Half-Life deathmatch almost seems more like they're hacking than utilizing emergent gameplay.

Once a game becomes full of these bad emergent gameplay elements, they become fun for the select few that have learned them because it's really fun to run around and dominate with the skills you've learned - but the difference between these types of elements and more healthy emergent gameplay elements is that new players will leave the game quick. Why? Not just because they are getting crushed like you might think, but because the process of learning all the gameplay elements to not get crushed just aren't that fun, so they leave.

And yes, to sum up, what is good and bad emergent behaviors is very subjective. As someone who has played a lot of shooters at a high level, I always personally hated it when games had bunny hopping because it fundamentally changed the game in a way that was ridiculous to me, but I still had to learn it if I wanted to compete at the highest level. I think most game developers agree as well, which is why they patch it out other than in arena shooters where it fits better.

&gt;Yeah, this tends to be how people feel about losing things that they like. There is nothing wrong with simplifying game mechanics or core gameplay, but there's also nothing wrong with being upset if it does happen. You sound like you're implying that a playerbase is shallow or ungrateful when in reality there is nothing bad about being happy with something and then being unhappy without it. If something were different from the very beginning, then the people drawn to the things that were once a part of it likely never take interest (at least not for those reasons).

You've also greatly misjudged me here. I'm super mad they added skill based match making to the shooters I play and I often voice my displeasure over things the games I play change. I was just explaining why sometimes things that upset the more vocal part of a small community like Reddit can actually be healthy for the game. Respawn says Apex Legends is a much healthier game with SBMM. In my mind, I don't see that, but I was trying to answer the OP's question with that example.

When it comes to juggle mechanics, I was aware of the skill involved you cited, it just isn't that interesting to me personally. What ends up happening is an entire bout is determined by like 3 initial hits that turn into combos. I acknowledge there is a lot that goes into getting that initial hit or not being the one hit, and capitalizing on their mistakes, but I don't like gameplay that has so few moments of interaction that determine the outcome and that requires you to rely on your opponent to mess up at times to have a chance of getting back in the fight. I don't think it adds much strategy to the overall fight personally as compared to something with many moments of interaction that determine the outcome of a fight. It's just not my *personal* idea of a great fighting game, and does have the problem of creating a more niche game due to the time requirement involved. As /r/Seantommy said above

&gt;If you like the combo systems of more traditional fighting games, more power to you. But those systems will always be more niche because of how unfriendly they are to less skilled players...  ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" is usually best.

In general, I could respond to many more of your statements, but I think you've just mislabeled or misunderstand what I was saying, which I think you get by now, and don't want to create too long of a wall for you to read.",1577837012

"iamverybadass","t5_386om","Consider your point of view. You seem to be a fighter someone kin to fight for his life. Let's put aside the *iamverybadass*, I will assume you are perfectly honest and, thus, are someone who had his share of fights, including fights in which his life was at stakes and not simple and idiotic ""high school fights"" or pub brawls. Maybe you are a soldier and are along the few who had to survive a knife fight during service.

That's the point : you are educated on how to fight, you have a state of mind, a mental of fighter. This is very helpful in a fight, as I'm sure you know.

Most people would rather beg for their life than fight for it. That's something really hard to overcome, they aren't led by the same state of mind as you. Especially when it's not a fight but an assault beginning by a backstab. The surprise is important, it can stun someone.

I understand what you say and, as someone who was taught how to fight, educated on this subject matter and who had his share of fight including to save his own life, I do agree with you on a certain extend. However, my opinion is far less... Let's say ""absolute"" than yours as people in general and even I may not have a comparable state of mind as yours.

A stab is a hell of a pain and incredibly scary. Most people will lay down and beg. Few think ""ok, my life's implied. I need to offer at least an equivalent response, whatever it takes. Pain is not relevant"".",1577837013

Nixon's impeachment cited no specific criminal statute. The first impeachment in the United States cited no criminal statute.

High Crimes and Misdemeanors historically and recently did not refer to actual crimes, and hinging an argument about impeachment on no specific crimes having been cited is ridiculous given our precedents.",1577837014
"Ultralight","t5_2s7p2","I got the Heat Seeker with ground dweller option April 2019. First time quilt owner(I'm definitely a convert!) I've used it 12 nights in May in Zion/Canyonlands, 3 nights in Trinity Alps over 4th July, 36ish nights in Spain thru hiking the GR11 in August/Sept and a couple California coast winter weekend trips plus some car camping. Overall, I think it is a good value, but it won't be my one and only, do-it-all quilt. I am a cold sleeper, so for me I am not comfortable in this quilt down anywhere close to 20 degrees - with thermals and puffy, of course. If I were to rate it I would say maybe 30 degrees. There is not as much fill in the side flaps as I would like and the down shifts away from the seam with the top portion of the quilt so I get cold spots on the sides. The sides do not have baffles and the center portion doesn't wrap fully around my body. I do not have wide shoulders, I wear a 38 jacket. I do also wish I had drawcord at the top and maybe a snap for colder nights - I was a quilt newb and hadn't seen any examples of Steve having made a quilt with those options, so my bad for not asking him to add those. I  like the nylon materials, the inside is semi heat reflective material, but once again only on the center portion and not the side flaps. The pad retention system is super simple and I \*think\* other systems seem better(of course this is the only quilt I have used...)

Even in the middle of summer I experience sub 30 degrees at high altitude at times, so I find myself wanting to get something a little warmer. All that being said, I still think it's a good value if it will fit your needs. And in a hammock with an under quilt I think I'd be comfy down to 20 degrees no problem. Maybe I should try some hammock camping!",1577837014

My hunch is that having the center of mass offset from the axis of rotation causes the forces acting on axle (or whatever it's rotating on) to be unbalanced. If you think about a tiny segment of the object as it rotates, there must be a force between the segment and the axle to keep it in circular motion. If the center of mass and the axis of rotation line up, then the force from each little segment is nicely balanced by some other segment on the opposite side. If they instead are misaligned, then the mass is distributed more on one side of the object, and there will be an unbalanced force pulling on the axle.

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","It could be argued that no project has seen any type of real adoption yet, nobody has made that first killer Dapp to change the world, so the field is wide open.  I don't think that's quite the case, and as I see things Eth has some massive advantages over the competition.  In a space that is already massively risky to begin with, where huge gains and losses are the norm I can't justify holding more than a tiny position as a moonshot in anything besides BTC or ETH.

&amp;nbsp;

There are several advantages I feel eth has over other projects starting with first mover advantage and better brand recognition.  The chain is also very secure second in hash power only to BTC.  As they are so established many other projects and tokens use their chain, some with decent potential,  take BAT, and LINK for example. Their biggest advantage of all though has to be the number of developers working on the platform and the amount that has already been developed.  There is a severe lack of competent people with the necessary skills to meet the demand in the market.  The majority are working on projects on the Ethereum chain, solidity is the go-to blockchain language for new people to learn with more ans more tools developed all the time.

My best guess is we will start to see some real use grow in applications related to gaming sooner than later.

"LabourUK","t5_30c1v","&gt;&gt; But Starmer would be able to hit back why the CPS carried out their prosecutions.
&gt;
&gt;When the papers are throwing out constant stories about *this* paedophile or *that* terrorist that Keir Starmer 'let out early' while he was head of the CPS, or releasing loads of other stories about figures he defended as a barrister, do you think him 'well *technically*'ing about judicial principles will cut through?

I think that Starmer would know infinitely  more about any case he's personally tried more than any hack journalist. Which is why it would be completely different to any Corbyn era smearing.

&gt;No. And that's exactly my point. The right-wing press showed in this election that they are perfectly willing to lie about anything and everything to get their candidate elected. They won't just suddenly start being honest and moderate if someone marginally more centre-left than RLB becomes Labour leader. It's why we need to stop obsessing about playing their game and start thinking about ways we can engage with the public that *aren't* at the behest of some ghoulish right-wing billionaire. Because I really don't want to be saying 'I told you so' in 5 years time when the right-wing press do to the next Labour leader what they did to Corbyn, and Miliband, and Brown, and you were simply unprepared because this time you expected them to be *nice*.

No one is expecting that at all. It's going to be horrible whoever is chosen. But I'd rather have a barrister defending themselves and attacking papers than anyone else. 

&gt;&gt; Not everyone has thrown their hat in the ring yet but he is either first or second in every poll that has been carried out to date. Bit early to write him off.
&gt;
&gt;As far as I'm aware one poll has come out. Keir was first... with 9% support... with over 60% of responses saying they 'don't know'. Which only highlights that it's far too early to pull this 'reductio ad pollum' bit. 

Time will tell on that one. Starmer will be favourite though. 

&gt;&gt; She doesn't come across as a leader who could beat Johnson to me. And that's the bar she has to beat.
&gt;
&gt;On what actual evidence? Because every time I've seen her speak or seen the policy she has written it has come across as strong. 

Perception doesn't have evidence. It's a subjective thing. She was far more prominent in the campaign than Starmer who was locked away like Abbott, Thornberry and to a lesser extent John McD and we all know how that campaign went. 

&gt;&gt; Of course that is true. But then you had the right wing join the Labour Party and crow about it to vote for Corbyn because they thought he wouldn't win anything. Turns out they were right. Don't underestimate the information released by gloating from the right wing.
&gt;
&gt;Weren't the same people also gloating about May being guaranteed a 100 seat majority? I expect better of Labour supporters than to buy into bad-faith right-wing talking points.

They did gloat about a majority for May but had to settle with gloating with the Tories merely winning instead in 2017 and then gloating even more in 2019 when Labour decided that the same campaign yet more radical would win easily.",1577837018

After about 6 in-game months I was level 17, and it just felt wrong. How could a young elf child-wizard possibly gain that much power in so short of a time?

I now DM for a party in 5E. I got them from level 1 to 4 in about 7 sessions. I have since told them that I was going to slow down leveling a lot. I expect to level them up to 5 after session 13 or so.

That said, I'm an advocate for using a credit card for everything possible. That requires discipline to properly use a card (meaning charge what you have the money for, and never carry a balance that's charging interest) but so does having a credit card in general.

Pre-patch 5.2 there was no auto aim rotation.

So on console a lot of players had really bad controller aim and if you were a skilled player with good controller aim you could beat those players regardless of what weapon they were using or even if they were using a higher fire rate weapon. There was a clear skill gap.

Personslly I would use a Geweher 43 with the hip fire specialisation on any map and do well, and of course if I came up against an equally good player using a Tomi gun in QCB I would get owned.

But after 5.2 a player that previously would struggle to get their intial aim on target, now has a strong aim assist to help them do so.

So before I could use skill to beat them, but now that has closed significantly. So instead of getting owned by a skilled player I can easily get owned by a noob with a faster firing weapon.

Both of us are going to be on target but if they are using a Suomi  and I still a Geweher, they have a far better chance of killing me first.

The Assault class has been nerfed into the ground, and sure the medic weapons might be more balanced. But that's part of issue.  I either adapt and just play the medic class, the Assault class with one viable gun the STG44, the Support and its limited range of weapons or the extreme opposite as the scout.

With 5.2 our playing choices of weapons have been limited not expanded. I'm sure all the medic and scout mains are fine with 5.2 and feel it's a good change. 

But for me I want to be able to choose a weapon and challenge myself to master it. Test out its different spec tree builds and see what is and isnt viable.

Without auto aim rotation in the game your skill to be accurate allowed you use more weapons in each class.

I guess the only way to put it in perspective to a PC player would be like  playing against a known regular bad player, then all of a sudden they are good and their shots are snapping on to your. Your going to call them out as a hacker.  So essentially DICE has added a soft aim bot to console to make it noob friendly.

At the end of the day I'm not having fun with the current state of the game so I choose to not play it.",1577837023

"SexWorkersOnly","t5_31jn4","I agree, it saddens me whenever I see people in this sub putting others down for having drug addictions. Sex workers hate being attacked/shamed by society and wish they were accepted, but then can be so quick to similarly shame/attack another group of people on the outskirts. I actually see quite a few parallels between the hardships sex workers face and the ones that drug addicts face. 

I remember reading a comment from a SW saying they were outright better than SWs with drug addictions, solely because they didn‚Äôt have an addiction. That echoes snooty disgusting behavior of vanilla civilians thinking they are better than SWs solely because they don‚Äôt do sex work. Or SWs saying you shouldn‚Äôt fuck for drug money, like vanillas saying you shouldn‚Äôt fuck for money, period. Both instances are a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù group dictating what the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù group can or cannot spend their money on.

Similarly, both sex workers and addicts fall prey to heavy stereotyping. Not all addicts are untrustworthy, liars, thieves, cheats, jobless, dirty, diseased, so high that they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, etc. Just as not all sex workers are abuse victims, dirty, drama filled, STI riddled, pimped or trafficked, sex crazed, etc.

I just hope in time, people become more understanding and empathetic to both sex workers and those who struggle with addictions.",1577837023

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I've seen these complaints before, but i guess maybe it requires an understanding of the characters and the lore as well as the numerous clues they drop about every character. 

First and foremost the batman in the movie is not a good guy. He's a psycho, he's gone off the rails, he's lost Robin &amp; lex has taken advantage of bat's instability &amp; pushed him to the edge. Alfred literally talks about it, he has a monologue about that's how it starts, the rage. Etc. 

Burce literally also says at the end how he failed superman. 

Actually the symbolism is so good that it went right over most people's heads.  

I'm not sure where u saw batman being stupid, but I saw an intensely angry person driven to the edge and using that intellect to kill what he sees as a threat.  

In fact the entire movie is about batman coming to terms w his humanity and superman understanding his place in society and also discovering and proving his humanity and inspiring humanity in others.  

Superman doesn't kill anyone in the movie.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/7bgm6l/bvs_if_anyone_wondered_what_happened_to_that/ 

He explicitly states in the movie that he didn't kill anyone.  

I'm happy to explain any of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GLqIh9jOf4

I think snyder's problem is that people go into the movie expecting dumb action films and not ruminations on philosophy and character studies. These criticisms are from people who have failed to understand the movie or about batman or about character development. 

Snyder is, surprisingly enough, a very intelligent subtle film maker. There's another video about sucker punch that studies his intent behind that movie and how most failed to grasp that too.

Okay so for context, because I know the title is kinda vague. I am 22, and in September found out I have a brain tumor. I was living 100% independently, 3 hours away from home. Prior to this I only lived with my mom, but would occasionally stay with my dad. 
So the tumor happened and I had to move back home, due to safety reasons, and hospital appointments. I ended up staying back and forth between both of my parents houses. 
My dad was a bit over bearing at first, but for over it more after a few weeks. But it was still a huge change and that was making it a bit harder. 
So fast forward about a week before Christmas, I was about to finish my radiation treatments, and was weening off my medicines. My dad kept talking about how I will be able to control my schedule more, and decide where I stay after these appointments were over, and I was very much looking forward to that as my dad lives out in the country, the closest store is a farmers market and hour walk away; and I can‚Äôt drive at the moment. 
So the day before my last appointment, I had a seizure. I don‚Äôt remember any of it, or was mild, and I am perfectly fine now, they just decided we need to ween off my medicines a bit slower. Now my dad on the other hand is on full overbearing mode again. Which I get it, he was the one who saw me and had to call 911. But it‚Äôs just so much for example he already planned for me to be at his house 4 days next week without really asking me. I just want to be able to have some freedom. Especially given at my moms their is much more accessible to me within walking distance. I feel bad because I know he‚Äôs just worried and cares, but I also feel suffocated. WIBTA If I told him he needs to give me more space?

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","I wasn‚Äôt able to go to graduate school because of my chronic pain, and I totally understand the emotional toll that losing a dream like that can cause. The dream is not gone forever, it just may take longer than we‚Äôd like to reach it. There is absolutely no shame in temporarily letting them go while we care for ourselves. 

What helps me is remembering that it‚Äôs never to late to go back to school, or pursue new avenues. While nothing is guaranteed, the exception is that things change, and that means you have the power to change them. 

I hope you are able to find some relief, and just remember that there are others like you who can share your pain. ü•∞",1577837025

The only way to be 100% safe is to not get behind the wheel if you‚Äôve had ANY amount of alcohol. Police will be out in full force tonight looking specifically for impaired drivers which means you have a higher chance of being pulled over for small things which police may normally overlook. Examples are; not signaling 200ft before a lane change or 100ft before a turn (this is the law in my state, it may vary depending on where you live), driving *under* the speed limit or running a yellow light. 

Also, *if you see something, say something*. Many states/cities/municipalities have specific phone numbers to report impaired drivers. By calling and reporting someone that is driving recklessly/dangerously, you just might save their life or someone else‚Äôs.

"FundieSnark","t5_j1u6f","Working on it on and off (slacking off at work lol)...here are mine so far!


*Story of the Year*: The Royal Wedding. JRod‚Äôs famewhoring efforts paid off with PRECIOUS Nurie‚Äôs engagement to none other than Nathan Keller, brother of Anna DUGGAR. Given Jill‚Äôs previous history of bad behavior at weddings, the fact that she pre-purchased Nurie‚Äôs wedding dress when she was 14, and the question of whether the marriage will lift her persona non grata status with the Duggars, nothing else has quite captured the snark community‚Äôs imagination. 

*Villain of the Year*: Lori Alexander. Every single thing she posts just reeks of vile internalized misogyny. She quite literally believes that women exist only as baby factories and housekeepers, and that they should put up with abuse within their marriage. Unlike other fundies who have a tendency to post mundane things, each Lori post seems destined to outdo the last in being a hateful dumpster fire.

*Worst Husband*: Joe Donaldson, boss of Sierra Jo Dominguez‚Äôs husband Mark, and involved in the NWA fundie community. Joe is best known as the creeper and predator who keeps posting photos of himself in very questionable positions with young girls and calling them his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. He falls under ‚Äúworst husband‚Äù because he posts more affectionate photos of his 14-year-old stepdaughter Naveah than his own wife.

*Worst Comments*

Racism: The Baird family collectively, for their willful deceit and misinformation surrounding their grandfather, who was a Nazi party official. 

Misogyny: Everything Lori posts. Can‚Äôt pick one

Queerphobia: Baptist pastor *and police officer* Grayson Fritts says that LGBTQ people are freaks who should be put to death

Bad politics: Jed Duggar announcing his run for office against a pro-choice and pro-DACA incumbent

Pro-abuse: Gently Led Sisters spanks a child for going to the bathroom during church

*Funniest/Most Embarrassing Photo*: Any photo of Birthy and Dav showing forced ‚Äúaffection‚Äù, particularly when they‚Äôre kissing

*Most Tasteless Photo*: JRod posting graphic photos of her sister Angie‚Äôs infected leg",1577837027

Those who aren‚Äôt heretics basically are, as much as our Western apathy about everything allows.

&gt;It's an extremely bizarre accusation given the fact that the Catholic Church (a) uses annulments for the exact same situations where we use divorces, and (b) has a de facto ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy regarding birth control. An overwhelming majority of married Catholic couples use some form of birth control, do not believe it's wrong, and do not get barred from communion for it (neither for the use of birth control, nor for their belief that it's okay).

I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so bizarre about arguing that, despite the fact that the East and the West both can tend to tolerate easy practical divorces and contraceptive use, at least the West didn‚Äôt let this tolerance compromise what they believe are the actual Apostolic and Patristic teaching on these subjects.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Sorry this might be abit mixed and Long but Ill try keep it as simple as possible, just some quick background on me (to be blunt I have Daddy issues, my father is a waste of space and I will do anything in my will to be a better and turn out nothing like him) Me (22) and my partner F (23) recently had a baby we dont live together but we live literally across the road form each other (Shes enjoys living with her parents so she doesnt want to move outü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). The pregnancy was planned and my partner went through the ringer she got pre-natal depression and when I say she hated me for 4 months she didnt even want to see me... throught out the all of the months I was there week in week out as often as I can be with a rotating shift pattern, fast forward to Our baby being born I was working 12 hour shifts and then going straight up to the hospital to stay with her in a terrible little chair so she wasnt alone she was in hospital 6 days before they decided to take her down for a c-section that I was there for and supported in anyways I could, then 2 days later she was finally released to go home as they was okay with it. We decided I would split up my paternity one week when Baby was born and one week at christmas so we could spend christmas together as a family. So the first week of Paternity she didnt want me to stay over as ""Her and Baby needed to get into a pattern"" I thought ""Okay this must be normal I dont know Ive never had a baby before"" so the end of the week came and the end of the first week paternity and she was still rocking the pattern boat which I was still okay with what ever helps, Then I started working again and all my shifts were Night shifts working till 1am etc 5 nights a week I also took some overtime as she was urging me too for Baby so I did 6 nights that week. Then I fell ill I got a chest infection ontop of my right lung not taking in enough Air so I was really ill almost hospitalized they told me I cannot go near baby it could be life threatening for her as it was for me, Then a week later after strong anti biotics no improvement so I went back to doctors and got told the infection has travelled to my intestines and got signed off work again and given more but different anti biotics, So now after a week of those and still a week left signed off I asked My partner If I could stay over one night soon as I literally havent had the chance too except for 1 day in 3 weeks. I want to help I've been ill and not been able to help much except pay for milk and nappies and all luckily she has her parents around but I was literally told to stay away from Baby for her own sake. My partner is now telling me Im ""not bothered at all about baby"" and that ""She doesnt need my help"" because I havent stayed over hers so far, But literally havent had a choice Because I don't understand what I could do differently I couldnt even celebrate christmas I was that ill... so AITA for asking to stay over now Im better?

From the backyard of the place I was renting you could see into part of the back of their house where the wall was seperating from the roof. Literally look into one of the trash rooms. 

They had a major rat problem, and it was so congested that the rats would eat the food and whatnot in the front of the house, leave and walk along out fence to get to their nest in the back of the house. When they started coming to our property is when I spent a couple days with an air rifle shooting them as they walked along the fence.

I posted a few weeks back about how we were getting a third opinion on his eye, as the first two simply chalked it up to conjunctivitis and even though we had a pressure test, were told that it's normal...despite the cloudiness, despite the enlarged dialated pupil.

Yesterday we checked the pressure again and it had ballooned to more than double what it was prior, to 57, which is well beyond the marker for a glaucomatose eye. He has suffered so much throughout this situation due to bad and uncareful diagnosises and we are heartbroken it took this long to properly identify it when we sort of had a gut feeling from the very beginning that it was glaucoma (and were very vocal with the vets about it), for Kai had to suffer the pain for longer than necessary.

Him losing an eye doesn't change anything. We love him, but this has been very hard on us and we worry about Kai moving forward, especially if his second eye becomes effected.",1577837031

&gt;**Joe Alves: Designing JAWS** provides the production designer's view into the development of this world-renowned film. Included are Joe's stunning pre-production illustrations; handwritten location and production notes; on-set photographs; blueprints of the shark's design; and first-time publication of his complete catalog of storyboards.

Everyone that buys a copy of the book from either us or as an add-on to their ticket purchase at the Crest will be invited to a private signing and meet and greet with Joe, Dennis and Greg at Capital Books before the event at the Crest. Joe will discuss the book and his set designs of Jaws at the Crest before the movie plays, so come see a unique movie experience with us.

You can buy tickets and the book online, or in our store (save the online fees!) Reserve a copy of the book sooner rather than later as supplies may end up being limited. This should be a fun experience for all Jaws fans.",1577837032

&gt;I can where he was being called out for quote-mining for Darwin and it was clearly a joke

He has done [this multiple times](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/71atqm/the_mistreatment_of_ota_benga_examples_of_racism/) in the past. He regularly quotemines Darwin for some false outrage.

It is rarely, if ever, a joke.

&gt;he makes a decent argument here or there

I don't believe this has ever happened. Honestly, I have absolutely no clue when you think he has ever made a decently coherent argument. His best arguments mine science's cutting edge for some ongoing mystery by which to shape a god-of-the-gaps; his worst arguments are the outright lies he tells to support Sanford and his genetic entropy. Everything between is probability pleading or raging against the society, academia, or transsexuals that have rejected him.

These failures of his are well documented, but you have taken it upon yourself to protect him by banning one of our major archivists, someone who has documented almost every argument he has made in the past decade, who can provide cited fact to disprove his arguments.

You're making another echo chamber in here.",1577837033

Now, on mental illness, schizophrenia is not a heightened state of reality. It is often the opposite and typically has a very negative effect on the lives of people who experience it. Schizophrenia is also likely to be somewhat hereditary, it has genetic markers associated with it, and people who have family members with it are at higher risk of developing symptoms.

- **February: Hanamaru won the 4th center single elections.** So happy for my best Aqours girl to win and had lots of fun taking part in the elections.
- **May 31: Puchiguru shuts down.** I've always hated to see that cute game go, but the biggest thing I did with that game was rip the sounds and music for the /r/Puchiguru data rescue team.

2019 was also the year when I started diving into this wonderful community, even if I had some days when it's hard for me to keep up, and met a lot of cool people with similar interests as me, some of you even got to meet me IRL. I think just being a part of this subreddit and its Discord server and having fun with all of you is what made 2019 a big year for Love Live IMO.

I totally have a good feeling 2020 is gonna be even a bigger year for Love Live staff and this sub and myself too! I can't wait for even more adventures with you guys and surprises from staff in new year!

I really thank all of you here in /r/LoveLive, in /r/Puchiguru, and in the Discord for helping make 2019 an amazing year for me!",1577837033

""Awh. Oh! Frank, come on brother. 14 thou.""

""Hmm...""

&gt;John drives a hard bargain. I really like this piece, and I KNOW I can sell for a huge profit, to the right buyer. But with what John's asking, I'm gonna be lucky to break even.

""Alright John, here's what we'll do. I'll pay you 9k for him up front. Money in your hand. That's a down payment on a new car, right there. When he sells, you come on down to our shop, and I'll hand you 10% of what we sold him for. Deal?""

""You'll hand me 20% and it'll be a deal""

""12.""

""15.""

""15.""

""Sold.""

&gt;Awesome. I picked this genuine Canadian Male for a sweet deal. 9 thousand now, and a 15% cut of the sale. With my estimates, I stand to make at least 7 thousand off this pick, maybe more. John didn't make it easy, but I am so excited to get this up in our front window that I don't even care.",1577837034

Yes, and I've repeatedly explained what is meant here, I've spoken to Griffiths regarding this statement. The divine within the context of the research is construed via the Perennial philosophy. We're not talking about God as first cause, that's what science has nothing to say about.

*****

This is the traditional review of the past year. May the New Year's Eve bring many miracles into your lives. In the meantime, we're going to review ComonGames studio's year 2019. Coming up with a review is always challenging and intensive. We browse through our developmental archives and journals, recalling what we were up to, and planning for the future. This is the usual pace of the game development industry: as we're finishing this article, you must be setting the New Year's festive dinner! However, this is the only way to get the most honest review of the year.It was the fifth year of working on The Uncertain universe. The year's been challenging, full of ups and downs. We redesigned many things. The more we throw ourselves into work, the closer we get to the release, the more things to improve and redesign we find! Something that's been there from the start might feel uncomfortable now. Sometimes we find better solutions and change the game, trying to make it as high-quality as we can. As is often the case in game development, deadlines were miscalculated, and the team has changed again. At the end of the day, we're good, but deep changes like these never go easy. The studio has grown bigger. Now that there are more of us, and we reorganized the process of development, we're looking to the future with confidence. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/90352cf04d6affba8e3fb7236cce02f415ec8067.jpgWe developed a range of different skills and practices what we were good at. There were a lot of new fields that we tried out for. You can read more in the series of articles about the team, which will be continued in 2020.  {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/8f051b30deaa3ed2bbc5bbc6e4ef890a0a6f967d.jpgThe game is way more advanced and developed than part one. It's only natural: we gain experience, and The Uncertain universe grows up with us. Perfectionism might be a slippery slope, but still, we hope you'll appreciate our effort. We transformed and improved Emily's appearance almost a dozen times. Not to mention her hair... but you must have heard this epic story :) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/a02259667162fb416518bfa452067b97da021107.jpgWe found a publisher, who also brought out some issues in the development process. It's always good for a project to acquire not only investments and marketing opportunities, but also ""smart money"": the past experience on different projects, the ability to identify gaps and deficiencies, and the knowledge of how to fix them. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/7d521ead85ba7ce7cbbe162edf663161fc2e2a7d.pngWhile completing part two, we've already started part three! We're really looking forward to showing you a little something in the upcoming year. So far, this is as much as we can tell you. All in good time. We wouldn't want to spoil it for you!We did a great job together with our new narrative designer Sergey Chekmaev. We finalized the story and narrative in 2019. Sergey worked outside his standard duties: together, we visited several showcases and events‚Äîour script even received the prestigious German award ""The Greatsword of Northern Lands"".  We also went to the 108 Minutes space festival and fantasy and sci-fi festival Starcon in Kaluga and Saint Petersburg in Russia. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/1d80fd65544efbfb75733280a779cec2c57769a5.pngThe game world is coming to life. Characters get animations and voices. We recorded Tatiana Sheetova for some of the VOs: she's the official Yandex Alisa's voice and Tissaia de Vries in the Witcher series.  She's also the official Russian Emily's voice in our game. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/1d921a72701e3e0bb957d26028b1315194fca10b.pngWe came to like writing long reads, and created over ten articles about the development process, the studio team, and the game universe. We hope that you like them too! Here's a question to our most dedicated readers: tell us what you'd like to read about in the upcoming year. Leave your comments in the comment section.Our news readers, our players who play part one and is waiting for the release of part two‚Äîall of you are our community, who supports us and guides us through our work. We have a pretty big treasure by the end of the second decade of the XXI century: 1100 subscribers on Steam, 4600 followers on VK and 12 000 on Facebook. Thank you for your support!We couldn't ignore the fan art we've been receiving from you! Just like other large-scale projects: we have drawings, paper models, and 3D-printed models. Seeing the game world growing beyond the virtuality is very important for a game developer. We deeply appreciate your creativity. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/8185a1192b161aab9508dd5d13a13c34e01a1476.jpgA thorough development is only one side of a project. Apart from that, it also needs testing. Otherwise it might become obsolete even before the release date and accumulate tons of glitches and bugs. We completed a Beta, which revealed some weak spots. There's a lot to do, but we aren't discouraged: we know exactly what we need to do.Last but not least, here's some real-life news: we rented and equipped an office space in Moscow. It's a big step for us. Until now, the whole ComonGames team worked remotely. The project will surely benefit from our offline meetings. We won't lie to you, it's very nice to see our colleagues in person! :) {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/ffbed965048cfdfa872e1dc61f1085c65dd24ab0.jpgThis is the end of the year 2019. 2020 is coming. The release date is planned. In 2020, we'll work on part three and complete the story of the universe. There's so much to do. We're very grateful to all of you who's been following the development of the game universe with us. It doesn't matter whether you can recall the very first demo versions of the game or have followed us just recently. Every player matters. May the New Year bring happiness to each and every one of you. Let the scary stories about the future remain a fantasy. May the real life keep your families together, and each day brings you hope. Happy New Year! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/33666106/7c758dbef2eb77abaa5f766b2473807fe1cb4e5c.pngLots of love, ComonGames Team

And that's the same with most of these players who come from the lower leagues. Too many bad touches that go unnoticed because of poor opposition, but would result in a goal scoring opportunity if taken against the likes of Vardy, Kane and Aguero.

But again, I have barely watched him.

"swrpg","t5_2vzmi","I've run similar campaigns, and my advice is be 100% certain you have full player buy in. These games don't work if players decide their characters have unrelated goals, or someone wants to play the Badass Loner, or the like.

I ran a four year long campaign where the players were members of the Rebellion's Foster Corps, a special operations outfit that existed for the purpose of recovering deep cover agents who were in peril or had their cover blown, high value defectors, and similar other ""sentient cargoes."" The team in question was one of the mobile Foster teams, sent in after high value ""Orphans"" who couldn't reach a Foster agent on their own (that being the preferred method of fostering).

As someone who actually comes out of the special ops world I'll advocate for toning down the realism quite a bit. A lot of stuff should be cut out for the purpose of keeping plot moving at a cinematic speed and not weighing the players down unnecessarily with morality pitfalls. While there's a lot more of the foundational work done for every doorkicking scene than you'd suspect, it's also far more boring than doorkicking, so avoid focusing on it (and discourage players from choosing archetypes that would demand it for their spotlight).

Intel gathering should happen on the fly, during action sequences, or entirely off-screen. Trying to bridge the gap just ends up feeling like someone dipped your crisp toast in milk. But make it clear to the players that there's a LOT going on around them to enable them to make that key leader engagement with self-styled Sullustan Colonel Dneb, whom the Imperials refer to as the Black Mole. Having an analyst NPC show up and drop half-completed theories about something you've got planned for a few sessions down the road generates a feeling of a living campaign, where the hard work of a supporting cast is enabling your heroic escapades.

Hanging a morality trap on the players every once in a while is fine, but if every mission presents a major moral conundrum, you're going to have a group that wonders why they even bother doing what they do. The people who do these activities are highly committed to begin with, and generally understand the stakes in a way your players might not grasp.

Consequences have to matter for the campaign to bite, though. A blown raid can lose the Rebellion an entire cell. Missed intel can result in losses from strategic surprise. But at the same time, if the team successfully steals a corvette for the Rebellion, that corvette's presence should be noticed. At least by the PCs.",1577837039

Name change gave me control over my identity, which NM had tried to control and manipulate for so many years. If you do it, do it soon. The more life you've built up under the old name, the more paperwork and people to explain the changes to there are.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

Thanks for understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

 

The Hunter Biden Burisma story is just the tip of the iceberg and there is a much larger extent to corruption in the country that not only connects Biden, but also Obama, Hillary and even Soros. This is something I recommend not only you watch, but spread around to other Trump supporters as well.

Heres a timeline of everything that happened:

* 2014:[Leaked phone call reveals a coup in Ukraine](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/10/leaked-obama-officials-including-ambassador-discuss-toppling-ukrainian-government-and-replacing-officials-with-bidens-approval-but-this-was-ok-according-to-media/) \- *In 2014 a phone call was hacked and released between Victoria Nuland, Asst. Sec. of State for Europe, and US Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt. (All with Bidens approval). The call was leaked to the news media on February 4, 2014.*
* [Around this same time](https://legalinsurrection.com/2019/09/report-former-ukrainian-prosecutor-viktor-shokin-swore-bidens-pressure-led-to-his-firing/), Biden pressures Ukraine to remove prosecutor Shokin from the case where he was investigating Biden‚Äôs son at Burisma in 2016.

Skip ahead to the 2016 elections between Trump and Hillary

* October 2016: A seemingly low level DNC operative named [Alexandra Chalupa](https://www.yahoo.com/news/16-people-who-shaped-the-2016-election-alexandra-chalupa-171541199.html) is named one of the key figures in the 2016 election, specifically for spearheading a campaign against Paul Manaford (Chalupa is a Ukranian-American and worked with the embassy btw)
* Around the same time: The US embassy puts pressure on Ukraine to NOT investigate [George Soros](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/435906-us-embassy-pressed-ukraine-to-drop-probe-of-george-soros-group-during-2016) linked groups in a broad anti-corruption campaign in their country
* May 2016:[Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/3962) revealed email exchange between Alexandra Chalupa and Luis Miranda (Comms director of the DNC and the middle man between Chalupa and Hillary). She specifically mentions using Soros funded groups like the Open World Society to work with foreign journalist in Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign)
* Nov. 2019: The Ukranian government revealed that [Chalupa made contact with them through the embassy in order to dig up dirt on Manaford and the Trump campaign](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/441892-ukrainian-embassy-confirms-dnc-contractor-solicited-trump-dirt-in-2016). The Ukranians reject her since this would clearly be a violation of the US elections by a foreign power.
* 2018: the Ukranian government says that the publications of the documents Chalupa gained through Ukranian journalist sources violated the law and[interfered with the US presidental election](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/publication-of-manafort-payments-violated-law-interfered-in-us-election-kyiv-court-rules.html?cn-reloaded=1)

And finally, there was this mostly ignored [article from 2017](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446). Ukraine was so embarrassed after Trump won that they apologized to him. This basically goes over the whole thing.",1577837047

"Clarinet","t5_2sc5o","If you go for a cheaper eb (ex, an older selmer, Yamaha 681, a better Bundy, or maybe a used E11/R13) that'll run you generally like $1500-2500 from my experience mattering on the condition. If you go this route, I highly recommend getting an after market barrel once you figure out your horn's pitch and tonal tendencies. Some people swear by the Fobes/Behn extension, but I don't have experience with those. You will totally need a good mouthpiece. 

This is the route I went and it has mostly been good enough. I got a very used Yamaha 681 for ~$2000 when I was in high school. Pitch was consistent within but not across registers  (chalumeau was good, throat tones were flat, low Clarion was sharp, high Clarion was flat, low altissimo was good, upper altissimo was a little less consistent). Had a really really good core sound, but was highly resistant. It was good enough to play well in my state's top honor bands. Playing at the University level is a different story for me. Resistance gave me problems with big leaps (Mahler 2 was a bigger challenge than it ought to have been) and my intonation is subpar no matter how hard I work. I got a BD5 mouthpiece which really made connections easier, and a backun barrel evened out pitch and made it less resistant. The horn at this point feels unplayable without these upgrades to it. I still fight it every day, but it's easier. This was a great horn to get used to during high school, but I pick up professional Eb's and they are so much easier to play and play in tune, and my colleagues and I agree I have outgrown it and no one at our level should be playing on it. 

My experience is that the more you are willing to spend, the easier it will be to play and play in tune. If you aren't looking to go too far with clarinet, a tricked out old crappy clarinet will do the job well enough, but you'll still probably be working pretty hard.",1577837048

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","One of the main problems with most of the ""support groups"" (the facebook, etc, ones) that I've seen, particularly the ones flooded with younger people. There is usually a very thin line between ""coexisting and both sides must learn to work on their flaws to make things right"" and ""screw you, I'm right and you're the devil, I'm different the whole world must adjust to me, I can't do anything at all and you WILL accept what I need"".

Some things might be out of control, sure, not denying this at all so it's not black and white, but when it's used as an excuse, instead of an explanation, to make the person in question right in the name of ""tolerance"" and ""being nice"", it doesn't end well. Problem is, it goes both ways. If you don't pay attention to this because you assume everything is easy for the other side it might end up creating even more problems, because you're asking for one-sided efforts, and people will not react to it positively since you're the one looking entitled in this situation. People aren't mind-reader so you're forced to blindly trust others; and this can be abused by anyone.


And if we're getting rid of actions altogether according to what couldn't do, then it just becomes hell on earth, because anyone could just use that against anyone in any situation. Work discrimination against aspies? Maybe the other person is doing everything it can to adjust to how you are, and it just doesn't work, it's too much, too bad. Repeat ad nauseam. Alone? You can't force anyone to accept you and deal with you. It's an extremely slippery rope to think this way.


As always, reality is way more complicated than that. Saying that ""one person cannot help it and you have to do all the job"" while also expecting the person to be treated regularly and accepted as anyone else cannot create a system that works.",1577837048

I will also recommend to always aim for center-mass shots. Basically shoot for the chest instead of the head. A single shot to the chest can be as effective as a headshot. There are the spine and heart which will kill instantly. The most times a single shot to the chest will take the target down. But, I will recommend whenever firing at a target, unless you have a perfect shot, you should double-tap all your shots. This basically leaves no chance of shooting your target in the chest and not instantly killing them. 

TLDR: Stay in cover, aim for the chest, and fire twice when shooting baddies.",1577837050

# Car choice advice:

**My advice: Try weaker AWD/RWD street cars first on easier tracks, that way you can taste the difference between the two layouts, and the engine positions**(Front/Mid/Rear). They behave different in almost every situation.

Here's a few examples for cars to begin with: (assuming that you have the Ultimate Edition)

AWD/Front Engine: Audi S1

RWD/Front Engine: Mazda MX-5 ND, Toyota AE86, Toyota GT86, and later the E30 M3

RWD/Mid Engine: Lotus Elise SC

I didn't really bother with FWDs, I think they're not worth the time, and not really fun. But if you feel like you would like to go for it, Alfa Romeo Giuliettas are good choices.

There are plenty of proper mods available on multiple sites, they can be pretty good as well. PM me, and I can give you further advices, sources for that.

I chose to ignore the Semislick tyre option for most cars, because: Semislick tyres grips better than street (or worse) tyres, but if you go over the limit, I think it's easier to correct the mistakes, but it's just my humble opinion.

# Technique advice:

Take off/Straight lines: Nothing to say here really. If you don't choose to drive with a monster on four wheels, you won't find too many issues going in a straight line.

Braking zones and distance: Racing lines can be useful at first, but you may want to find other points of reference for braking later on. Every car has different brakes and tyres, some can decelarate faster, or slower. It's a matter of experience, and practice.

**Cornering: Better safe than sorry! Slow in, fast out is the way you want to take corners at first.** Be careful on the ""fast out"" with rear-wheel driven cars however, they're prone to oversteer, if you push the throttle too hard. 

Downshifting, and Heel&amp;Toe: You'll need this technique on older RWD cars with conventional manual gearboxes. If you downshift without matching your revs to the occasion, the driven wheels will lock up, and you'll lose traction. What you want to accomplish here is to rev up the engine while you downshift, and when you release the clutch pedal, engine rev will be high enough, and shit won't happen. Brake pedal pressed by the toe, gas pedal pressed by the heel. (I don't really use that because of my feet and leg size, I rather deal with the countersteer instead.)

Here's a visual presentation of that with a legendary car:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzH0rzVpErU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzH0rzVpErU) 

**My further advice is you'll learn faster if you turn the driving assists off (Except ABS, leave that on Factory). The key is to find the ""sweet spot"" of maximum traction, if you go beyond that, you'll spin out.** You may want to avoid that. The next lesson is to countermeasure the slipping. (powerslide, or drift with countersteer) Front engined cars are recommended for that.

Once you get it what it means and feels like to ""push over the limit"", you can go to faster cars.

There are plenty of good beginners guides on YouTube too, I watched these for example (Not all presented in Assetto Corsa, but IMO they're good in general):

Basic&amp;Advanced techniques:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ6i4INmISE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ6i4INmISE) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx2BOnJ7Nsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx2BOnJ7Nsk) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIaxLYl9VqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIaxLYl9VqM) 

Powersliding, and drifting:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y94bpGZtn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y94bpGZtn0) 

It's going to be a hard course, but improvement will show as time flows. 

When I started I couldn't drive an old Miata through corners without crashing, and after about 100 hours of driving, [I managed to do a clean lap on the Nordschleife in 8 minutes with a RUF Yellowbird, on street tyres.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsvsSamdrO8) (Yet you can still see the thrill of fear on my steering movements, it's one of the toughest stuff :) )

"modelmakers","t5_2sf9u","Spattering might be your air pressure. I found I got spattering when the pressure was both too low and too high. There's a range in the middle that's ""just right"". Make sure you have a pressure regulator and moisture trap on your compressor. Set the pressure at 10psi and go from there, see what works for you. 

It could also be paint related, I had certain paints that gave me trouble no matter what, some just needed thinning. Don't thin it too much or too thick, and don't let it sit in the bowl for too long. Try some different ratios to see what works best for the paint you're using. 

Lastly it might be a manufacturing defect with the cheap airbrush or needle damage, but I'd rule out the first few things before you determine it's the airbrush.

What paint are you using? I've found Vallejo modelair and Tamiya works well. If you're going to be spraying for a long time there's a chemical you can add that stops the paint from drying on the nozzle, usually sold as either ""flow improver"" or ""paint retarder"". Both Vallejo and Tamiya make it. Some people swear by that stuff, personally I've never used it, but might start as I've had issues with paint drying on the tip.",1577837051

There's another possibility, that the simple truth of the original church got complicated with man's rules, and the Reformation was an attempt to reconnect to that earlier form of the church. If that is the case, then it might explain why under the tight warp and woof of religious do's and don't's, which can easily amount to a works-based attempt at salvation rather than salvation by grace, you are subject to more morbid fear - which clearly is not of God according to the Bible; whereas under a more free form of worship from the heart you were more in touch with the Spirit of God. (compare John 4; 2Cor 3; Galatians)

The Bible may have been formally canonized only centuries later, but most of its texts were extant very early on. They have always been a central part of the life of the church. In my view, one does not need the RCC in order to have the Bible.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","That is pretty much what I meant by more simplistic. The whole RISK mechanic isn't well explained and really bogs down the combat, accessing the status of enemies you Analyze is really hidden. They have a submenu to quickly access magic and items but don't have one for weapons, the infinitely more important aspect of the game which you do probably every other room. The storage box requiring you to save leads to saving before doing anything, saving at the storage box, doing all the crafting and then finally saving again. I assume PS1 memory limits hamper how many blades/grips you can carry and your fully combined weapons still counting toward those limits.

RISK exists to combat the player just spamming so it forces a quasi-turn based combat system where the enemies actually get turns but it also leads to annoying RNG.",1577837053

And I don't know about you, but I don't like to try and reason with thieves and murderers. I would rather just beat the fuck out of them, because what's the point in trying to hear out a ""piece of shit"" try to justify why they are a piece of shit?

That was the mistake we made with Trump supporters in the very beginning, which was treating their views as if they were legitimate political concerns as if someone having the opinion that ""children should be separated from their parents to serve as a deterrent to Illegal immigration"" is somehow no different than believing that ""wealthy people should be taxed less"".

This is obviously not true. One is a moral disagreement, and the other is a political disagreement. This is why people hate Trump supporters way more and dislike Trump supporters more than we ever have when it came to supporters of Bush, Reagan, Nixon, Etc

Because Trump is trying to normalize disgusting Behavior which is divisive and designed to hurt people, and his supporters are going along with it.

Note: I draw a distinction between ""people that voted for Trump"" and people who ""currently support Trump"". I can understand why people would have initially voted for him. I cannot understand why people would currently **still** be supporting him after everything he has done unless they themselves are also inherently immoral bastards that I personally would like to beat the fuck out of for being such a sick fuck, much in the same way that you would want to beat up a child molester for being a sick fuck.",1577837054

"TheGirlSurvivalGuide","t5_2vfzu","Okay, don't beat yourself up. It sounds like you have enough you're worrying about without piling on. Have grace for yourself and remind yourself that hardships come no matter what.

It might be good to find a job that isn't in your field of interest but something that you would still enjoy doing for the interim.  I am a Graphic Designer and get paid way less than a woman with my experience should &amp; I currently work two jobs: my Design job and another at a local restaurant. Without my second job, I couldn't pay my bills.

Once you have a job locked in that pays the bills, really start pursuing your UX Design career! There's lots of websites that you could begin to offer your services on, begin to build up a freelance client list, look for remote work, re-vamp your resume to include all the knowledge you have (whether accredited or not - education is education and you can put that shit on your resume), if you want to further your education start attending classes at a local community college/trade school (typically less expensive tuition). 

And just start putting yourself out there - anywhere you see even an minor opportunity, go for it. The worst a company can do is not respond. When you start getting interviews, talk yourself up - sell your abilities to them, explain why you would be such a valuable asset. Discuss with them your future opportunities within the company and what incentives they would offer you as far as experience goes. If they don't go for it, ask about internship opportunities or other opportunities you may have within the company that would allow you to work your way up or ""prove yourself"" to them. 

Unfortunately, being self-taught is viewed as ""less-than"", but if you're dedicated and show potential &amp;  passion for the subject, employers will be more willing to ""take a chance"" on you. 

I know this is getting long so this is my last thing, but try to connect with the person interviewing, whether it's sending them an email to their work inbox, connecting with them via LinkedIn, or giving them a resume + cover letter in person these will all make a lasting impression. Most of the time when submitting a resume online, it is run through a program to find keywords. If the resume doesn't hit a certain number of keywords, it's disregarded. By connecting to the person one-on-one or face-to-face you have a better chance of being considered for the position!

Best of luck to you &amp; Happy New Year! Remember to keep your head up, I promise things get better. Rely on your peers here and in real life for support as well. Support always helps in times like these.",1577837056

His first day was all meetings with the rest of the management team, to bring him up to speed and the state of the company, but during lunch he decided to come say hi to the IT team (just one other person and myself). Neither of us ever met the guy. 

Comes in, introduces himself, we introduce ourselves and we talk for 30 minutes about our experiences and plan an overview/IT meeting for the next day to go over the whole setup, design, systems... 

Then he notices my laptop, on which i was just configuring/testing 'Find my iPhone' and he says ""Wow, what's that? That looks useful"". I explain the concept and demonstrate. He goes off ""Oh, that's good! I have to set that up for my wife. She cheated on me 6 months ago and since then she has to send me where she is at least once every hour, and i have access to her e-mail, messages, call history, ... I check it every night before going to bed. This could make it easier to track her and make sure I always know where she is!""

Both my colleague and I were a bit flabbergasted at that... didn't know how to respond except with ""Euh, yeah... it's useful for if your phone gets stolen or you lost it...""

"TechnoProduction","t5_2v4k9","If you are going semi-modular, I would look for something else than these machines honestly.

The rytm/digitak devices are both sequencers and audio generators at the same time. 
They are a kind of 'all in one' box. If that is what you like go for it.
Neither one supports CV though. The Rytm have very basic midi out (added with the latest update)
The Digitakt can do more, it has 8 midi tracks with cc support. Though not CV, which is what you would need for any semi-modular/modular stuff.

Tr-8S (not the older tr-8) is very similar to the digitakt in it's function, though the workflow differs.
Both are samplers and sequencers in one.

I doubt you will enjoy working with these devices more than with ableton honestly, they are pretty deep machines with loads of menu diving etc. (that said, the elektron boxes are probably the best menu diving devices I know, they feel really as hands on as you can get considering)
They are more fun imo, because they are more hands on, but I would say, go even more hands on, get more basic devices, things like a DRM1 perhaps.
Or if you are going as you say, semi-modular, why not invest in some actual modular stuff?

Since you already have one of the most advanced sequencers available to man, a DAW, in your case Ableton, perhaps something like the DFAM would be more interesting for you?
This is a stand alone device, but also fully modular, fits right into your rack.
If this is your direction I would also consider investing in a es-8 or 9, which will give you direct CV output from your DAW, and allow for detailed control over your devices, more so than midi.
You can then start investing in more drum modules, find cool devices and just expand your modular system to have drum sounds you love the sound of and like to play with.
You cannot compare the joy of hands on modular gives you imo.

I would go for the Rytm/digitakt or any other 'all in one' box if you plan on moving around a lot, do loads of live shows and don't feel like carrying a lot of gear.
This is really their power, the are very portable, and very capable for their size etc, in my mind, too capable. 
If you want these boxes, I would personally much prefer a very simple drum computer like ye olde 909, or perhaps a drumbrute, or even the tr-8. These are ""basic"", but offer direct knob control over their sounds etc. You know what you are going to get, they really feel like instruments.
The Elektron boxes are super capable, they are like little computers in a box, which give you immense power, but also makes you feel lost, they do not really have 'character' because they can adapt to any character you want really. I personally do not really like that, my brain gets confused.

Being a lawyer is a social construct, does that affect your answer to my example?

These are things females deal with. Minors included. Just saying

&gt;then what is the socially constructed part

-Women on their period being unclean
-Women in some cultures forced to exile themselves to menstrual huts
-FGM
-Women being discouraged from pursuing careers in favor of child rearing

The socially constructed part is gender.

It isn‚Äôt a lack of Commons support that is wrong.

It is departing from what he has been explicitly told to do by the Commons.

To which your attempted defence was that he doesn‚Äôt need to do what the Commons wants because they were indifferent and did not take retaliatory action.

As I point out in the post, if a Speaker was biased towards a Government majority no retaliatory action would be taken. It does not mean that the speaker is not acting wrongly. The fact no action is taken doesn‚Äôt mean the Commons has approved a change in the rules of the House or of a change in the role.

As a particularly extreme example, the sewel convention can be broken even though it requires Parliament to break it. A choice is required to abandon the rule.

The speaker would require a choice of the Commons to change things. The only way for the conventions (that the speaker follow the standing orders and the Commons determines its procedure) they are breaking to change is by behaviour in the same way over very many years. That‚Äôs not going to happen because this has been a unique situation.

Additionally, there are simply not the mechanisms for the speaker‚Äôs accountability that would be needed for what you suggest to be effective. Though the original election is by secret ballot none of the subsequent votes on the speaker are. The person with immense power over MPs can see who opposes them. There are also very limited (often no) requirements for the speaker to justify their decisions in many areas.

I had to spend ten grand fixing his fucking mess. She still has barely enough to live on. Fuck dudes like that. Mom was never anything but sweet, but he thought as a 23 year old, that nothing would happen if he refused to use a condom to a virginal 17 year old, then was so pissed when it did, he made the product of it miserable for the rest of his life.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Most people just say she's useless, and while she isn't entirely useless her main purpose was because they wanted the whole crappy love triangle thing and wanted a girl on team seven. Her accomplishments aren't particularly notable because there is no solid reason any other character couldn't have done the same. She is often thought of as really annoying and immature. She's really bratty when it comes to her parents for absolutely no reason and in one of the movies she was complaining to Naruto about how awful her parents were. When he didn't get what was so bad about her situation with her parents, Sakura remarked by saying Sasuke would understand. Supposedly she's one of the smartest characters but a lot people would argue that she doesn't come off that way. And if you remember the iconic scene where she cuts off her hair, that both showcases her poor decision making and lack of skill. The enemy was open and lots of opportunities were available aside from cutting her hair. She could have easily rendered one of the opponents useless to continue combat but chose to cut off her hair. Personally, I'm mildly annoyed by Sakura but I don't hate her. I'm sure there are plenty more points you could find as to why people hate Sakura but here are a few.

And to be fair- most of the trails in the Dix Range aren't maintained to the same standards of most of the rest of the High Peaks trails.  These are unmarked herd paths that were never originally planned to be trails- they formed through use alone, and they are lower priority for maintenance.  As with the Seward Range, the Santanoni Range, and Allen especially, it's expected that hikers tackling the full Dix Range will be better prepared for a more challenging experience that demands a greater level of navigational ability.",1577837062

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","Proportional relationships can always be represented by the equation ""y=mx"" where m is the slope or rate of change. In other words, the slope can always be represented by the ""y"" value divided by the ""x"" value (y/x, constant of proportionality). You can visually test this on the graph if the line passes through the origin point (0,0) and to test for a table, divide the output (y) by the input (x) and see if the results are consistent. Non-proportional relationships are represented by linear equations where the b in ""y=mx+b"" is not 0. The slope can still be constant, but the relation is not proportional since you will not get a constant value when dividing the y by the x. [ex. y=3x is proportional because if we take a test points (2,6) and (3,9) and divide y by x, the constant will be 3 whereas a relation y=3x+1 where we use test points (1,4) and (2,7) and divide y by x, we will not get a constant (4 and 7/2, respectively]",1577837064

 We have one main rule that the subreddit was founded upon: *Every post title must start with the fire emoji and a space.* üî•

This works as a spam filter for those that do not read the rules and keeps our community high in quality.

If you don't think your post can justify using a fire emoji in the title, it probably isn't right to post here.

Try resubmitting your post with the fire emoji at the start your title.

You can copy and paste it from this comment or the sidebar if you're on desktop, and if you're using a phone your keyboard likely has it too!

Dahlin - Ristolainen

Pilut - Montour

Scandella/(FA Plug)/Hickey - Jokiharju

We will have about $36 million in cap space going into the off-season where we need to sign Reinhart, Olofsson, Montour, Scandella or FA Plug, Girgensons maybe, and Larsson maybe. Compare this to the Oilers who are probably going to finish around the same spot as we do in the standings and are in cap hell for the next few years.

One day, he got taken away by the police (I think for either assaulting a family member or theft, it's been almost 20 years now) and he laughed in the back seat when the cops drove away.  When the police interrogated him for that, they found he killed a kid.

The other was just a hot head.  I saw this guy deteriorate over the few years I knew him.  He went from a goofball skater guy, to a bully with a temper.  He was a year or two older, and when he got to high school, as a freshmen, stabbed someone at the school.",1577837067

naturally I meant if found mentally ill (insane) by the jury/judge.

this will be the last reply cause I know you are already failing to realize anything I wrote.

but will say once again.

Jail by itself should be rehabilitating, as in a place you never want to go back to.

you know why I haven't committed any crimes? it's not because I am scared of doing the crime, it's not because I am just a law abiding citizen, it's because I don't want to spend time in jail. The theory of jail itself is my rehabilitation to keep me on track.

If they start making jail some comfy place, I wouldn't fear it that much at all.

So when white people are discriminated against here, it usually doesn‚Äôt mean anything outside of the exact context it‚Äôs found in.  

Prejudice (thoughts) + discrimination (actions) + power= oppression.  Because white people hold the vast majority of the power in the US, they are able to legislate their prejudices into policies which actively discriminate against non-white people.  

When a person of color has prejudices against a white person/white people, it affects that one white person.  When a white person has prejudices against people of color, it contributes to the oppression of large swaths of people.",1577837068

Okay, any other background? Nobody tried to save the program.  After that, since 1964 workers were ""forced"" to cross the border without documents, bringing on the chaos at the border.  Way more people died, and way more became abused by contractors &amp; employers.

We know that the system of crests is falling apart and isn‚Äôt sustainable. We also know that the elite of f√≥dlan are very resistant to change. Consider how Ionius and lambert attempted peaceful reform and because they tried the nobles in their countries initiated duscur and the insurrection of seven. Plus this is without considering the fact that TWSITD exist and want to stir shit up purely for the sake of causing pain to the people who forced them underground. F√≥dlan at the start of the game was already about to explode. It just needed a spark to set it off. Edelgard happened to be that spark in the games timeline. In all likelihood, there would have been another spark, either one that arose naturally or one purposely put there by TWSITD. It‚Äôs like pre-WW1 europe. A war was probably going to happen no matter what, 

The only i could see the situation being fixed without a war is basically all three houses and rhea openly working together to end the problems of f√≥dlan. And considering how many secrets are flying around there that people aren‚Äôt willing to share, I doubt that‚Äôs possible.",1577837069

There are countries where it isn't required and some where it's considered rude, perhaps a change of locale is a good solution for cheapskates? 

I'll concede that boycotting would be about as effective as not tipping in that it would take an organized majority to have an impact. A few people here and there won't be noticed. 

Your hypothetical situation would be even more awkward if everyone ordered food but one person skipped tipping. Do you think that would change anyone's mind about tipping, because a person or even group was too cheap to tip like everyone else? Nah, it will make a person look like a cheap jerk.

I think we can all agree a better wage should be given to servers. But there are better ways to go about changing that, other than stiffing your server. But even if a better wage was offered, I personally would still tip those people for having to deal with assholes all day that complain about the littlest things.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Until Home releases, it will be very difficult to find a legitimate 6IV Ditto here. While 6IV Ditto could be obtained in past generations through RNG manipulation, these methods aren't currently possible in SwSh, nor is it currently possible to transfer these Ditto to SwSh.

For now, **any 6IV Ditto offered here is highly likely to be hacked, cloned, a [prohibited natural clone](https://redd.it/e2masp), or not actually 6IV**. If you come across someone offering a 6IV Ditto, we highly recommend exercising caution. You can read more about avoiding Ditto scams and finding legitimate Ditto [here](/r/pokemontrades/comments/e5qga6/watch_out_for_6iv_ditto_scams_and_hackedcloned/).

Instead, you may wish to use another subreddit to obtain a hacked/cloned 6IV Ditto, such as /r/morebreedingdittos or /r/pokemonplaza.

What that means in effect is that CIG is throwing stuff at us; we break it, we complain, we give them shit, and CIG fixes it.

So what we get right now is a vertical slice; a clean cut of the functionality CIG needs in order to give us what they want.

Sometimes their choices may seem strange, not in accord with what the cummunity is asking for.

But CIG can hear, they can read; they just know that in the future, a lot of things will change.

CIG is aiming for the game they promised; not the game we currently have.

This book, kaigun, sunburst, and Willmott‚Äòs two volumes are the foundations of my position, BTW. Shattered sword is useful because it‚Äôs an ePub and I can frequently catch you with your pants on the ground like in 1. Now you have to explain how you were totally incorrect about Japanese employment of battleships. Or you can admit you made a mistake. 

4. Once against easy copy pasting from Shattered Sword bolsters my position

‚ÄúIn fairness to the Army, it rightly wanted to preserve its strength for further actions against the Russians in Manchuria. Despite the mauling the Japanese had been subjected to two years earlier, in late 1941 it looked as if the Russians themselves were being overwhelmed. The Red Army had been continually beaten by the Wehrmacht during the previous summer, and to all outward appearances the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse. This reversal of fortunes for the Soviet colossus meant that there might exist real opportunities for the Japanese to seize more of Manchuria. But the net result was that the Army‚Äôs attention was not fully engaged by the Pacific.

This tendency reflected fundamental differences between the Army and the Navy about how the war was to be brought to a close. The Navy was steeped in a tradition of seeking decisive battle with its foes. It believed that landing a single roundhouse blow, if sufficiently powerful, would bring hostilities to a close. It was the Navy‚Äôs fervent hope, therefore, that the war could be concluded in 1942. **The Army, however, held no such illusions, particularly against an opponent as powerful as the United States. Instead, the ‚ÄúArmy was girding itself for a protracted struggle. It was deeply suspicious of any attempts to increase the size of Japan‚Äôs territorial holdings in the largely empty wastes of the Pacific, knowing it didn‚Äôt have the strength to garrison every outpost**. Instead, the Army wished to fortify an outer shell as strongly as possible, preparing to make the Americans pay an unacceptable price in blood when their inevitable counterattacks began. As a result, the Army consistently resisted any notions that looked likely to increase its troop commitments in the Pacific.‚Äù

Only the army started wars by junior officers. And the army, unlinke the navy was rightly terrified of the United States, even more so than the USSR. According to your thesis the army would somehow initiate a war against the United States if then navy didn‚Äôt. This is no longer tenable in light of what I presented.",1577837074

"blursedimages","t5_j34kt","If you want another funny story from that English teacher I just remembered about when he pulled one of the greatest pranks of all time. So as you've gathered by now, one must exercise caution when returning to our English class after an absence (especially if all your friends deny that they planned a prank) and I was definitely up there on the list of people who everyone would enjoy seeing get knocked down a peg or two so I was on high alert when I returned to school after missing a day. It was a Monday, so it had been almost four days since I had seen my English teacher last and I noticed him in the hallways before first period with a new haircut. We were always friendly and said hi in the hallways, but he didn't say anything even though I was making eye contact and expecting him to stop to chat for a second. He just walked right past me, but it was clear that he'd seen my eye contact and seemed to try to hide a smile as he intentionally looked away. Now his one weakness was his honest expressions and I was already highly suspicious of a prank so he basically just confirmed 100% that some epic prank was in the works and he knew that if he looked at or talked to me he'd give it away. At this point I'm actually a little insulted, as much as I was on guard I was still looking forward to their prank and to have spoiled it for myself so soon was disappointing. But not one to let an awkward moment go unchallenged I called out to him after he had passed me by 10~15 feet: ""Hey Mr. [His name], nice haircut!"" He stops and turns around slowly. He has the most awkward look on his face and he's got a big nervous smile on. I think he just gave me a nod or a wave or something and then turned around and kept walking. Not getting the response I'd wanted, I follow after him. ""Hey [His name] why you trying to be so coy, I know you're planning a prank!"" He stops and turns, his awkward bemused expression mixes with confusion for a moment and he just says ""Uh what?"". Now that's what I'm talking about, that was some good emotional control. Where was that when he was looking away and smiling like a schoolgirl when I said hi? So I told him ""you can't fool me, I saw your smile as you passed by and I know for a fact you're planning some big elaborate prank, and I'm on to it!"". Now of all the things I expected him to say to deny it, I never expected his response. He said ""I'm not [His name], I'm his twin brother. My name is also [His name]"". I just rolled my eyes in contempt and was like ""yeah, ok. I hope you just thought of that on the spot because if you think I'm going to fall for that it's never happening."" He just smiled and said ""I don't know what to say, I substitute teach for him sometimes, I'm surprised he didn't ever mention me"". Now I'm really insulted that he actually thought I was gullible enough to be convinced by his horrible performance. I mean he was obviously not a twin, it was clearly my English teacher futilely trying to convince someone who was way too smart to be fooled so easily that some impossible thing had happened. I spent over 5 minutes arguing with him about how stupid of a prank this was to try because it was so unbelievable, and of course the harder he tried to convince me the more I became convinced it was a prank. I said ""Ok then, show me your I.D. then and I'll believe you"" but he refused, probably because of personal info like his address but at the time it was just another piece of evidence proving how poorly thought through his prank was. 

Finally the bell rings and after one last admonishment, we go separate ways and when I get to class I loudly proclaim to the class (all the different AP classes had basically the same group of kids) that I'd discovered their prank and how dumb they were to ever think that they or our English teacher could ever convince me, an intellectual, of something so ridiculous. They all just started laughing at me and told me that it was our English teachers twin and he had substituted on the Friday of my absence as well. But of course, now that I knew they were in on it too I became 100% sure that this wasn't just some throwaway prank to cover for his awkward smile or to distract from the real prank, but that they'd planned it out meticulously as a class together on Friday. This continued for most of the day. 

It wasn't until English class that a girl I was close to pulled me aside and pointed out subtle differences between them that I even considered that I might be wrong. It was just so 'right out of a movie' that I never considered it might not be a prank. But still I was 90% sure it was still a prank and they were finally getting off on the satisfaction of my confusion and loss of certainty.

And then of course the next day he comes in with his old haircut and I'm like ""Fuuuuuuuuck!"". And of course his brother told him the whole story and so when he sees me he just laughs in my face for a good 5 minutes. 

I pranked myself. He wasn't even there when I was absent to plan a prank on me, he didn't even know I wasn't there on Friday. The dude is a Mastermind, playing 4D chess with his pranks. Fucking destroyed me without even making a move. 

I learned a valuable lesson that day. There are other ways to deal with pranks than trying to outsmart them, because trying will sometimes end up with you pranking yourself. 

Also, if you're into pranking, get yourself a twin. And don't tell anyone.",1577837075

Title: **Company Refusing To Refund Contract That They Breached Because Contract States 'Non Refundable'**

Original Post: 

&gt; This should be pretty cut and dry imo but wanted to make sure I'm not underestimating this if it goes to small claims:
&gt; 
&gt; We enrolled our dogs in dog day care a few months ago. We purchased a few 'packages' of days $XXX for X days of daycare.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a month we got complaints from the owners that our dog was able to open the doors and unless he stopped he would not be allowed to attend any more. We expressed feelings that making sure the dogs were secure was what we were paying them for but we still offered to pay for dog proof door knobs and would even consider additional training. 
&gt; 
&gt; They expressed that they would try and remedy the problem. And we thought that was the end of the matter. About 1-2 weeks later we were told that he was still opening doors and that they no longer wanted to have him in daycare. They offered to have him in individual daycare for an increased cost, but as we wanted this dog to get socialization we didnt fell this was an appropriate compromise. 
&gt; 
&gt; Frustrating but there was another company closer to our home so we went our separate ways, they agreed to send us a refund check for the unused classes.
&gt; 
&gt; While waiting for this refund check my wife wrote a pretty harsh review online. Apparently the owner was not thrilled about this and got into it a little bit with us...and subsequently canceled the check (which we  we were waiting to clear).
&gt; 
&gt; This was some time ago...we since have contested it on our cc but we are being threated with small claims court. The closest we got to resolving the issue since was them offering a credit for other services if we remove our reviews, which we have no interest in (either their other services or removing the review).
&gt; 
&gt; Their argument is that since the contract we signed said packages are non refundable they are under no obligation to provide us a refund. Our counter argument being that we still wanted day care (as evidence by us enrolling our dog at another location) and that they were the ones who failed to uphold the contract. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm fine to go to small claims court, mostly on principal (the refund for unused classes is only about $700) but will this be cut and dry or do they have a valid argument. 
&gt; 
&gt; TIA!

"smallbusiness","t5_2qr34","It varies by state and sometimes even district. Some work through the School Boards or even the PTA certifying or clearing offerings in advance. Others are less formal.

I'd look into how its done wherever you are by tracking down any past open bid and seeing what they document as a process. From there you may find a buyer who you can contact and ask about the processes. It would be easiest if you knew someone already doing the work in the district but lacking that you have to do the legwork.

That won't get you sales but it might put you on the approved to use list (if they have one) which is progress.",1577837077

Of course you are probably wondering why, well ill have you know he is simply perfect.

Not in the way you might expect however, he makes me shudder with disgust every time my eyes graze his model.

It is a true tragedy, but one I endure for the greater good, the true enlightenment.

Cursed, I am, with this knowledge. But what is it you fools are missing? Well, let me inform you cretins;

&amp;#x200B;

It all began when the gracious Frozen-Amphibian-Of-Heavens graced us mortals with the even more divine presence of Mireska Sunbreeze.

So of course, as I dedicated myself to this goddess of a fairy, I would pick her every game. More than just picking her in game, I picked her in life.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this of course, to show my pure devotion to her.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while at least, everything was perfect. With each tower falling, every last hit and kill, my bond grew deeper and deeper.

Unfortunately however, I failed to realize something. I would consider it my biggest oversight.

Crumbled apart, the perfect reality. It was just another game, another virtual lifetime admiring her soft fluffy wings, her cute pixie feet.

Killed. She..-I was. I let her down. I failed her.

Impossible. Entranced with her even as she gracefully fell to the ground, I fell into a rage. What hideous creature would dare lay a finger on such a goddess?!?

Never had I ever seen such a beast. What virgin had the embarrassment of rubbing out this five-polygon cumstain people think deserves to be on my screen?!?

Galvanized with rage, I immediately went to buyback. But before I could, what I witnessed stunned me more than even Mireska's cursed crown ever could.

&amp;#x200B;

Laying in front of my eyes, that watery diarrhea they call morphling, CHANGED. Into the-.. no, MY beautiful Mireska

Eclipsed by what I was witnessing, it slowly dawned on me. THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE DARK WILLOW

Giddy with excitement, groaning as I held the urge of coming on the spot; I had to wait for my goddess. There was work to be done.

Even though it hurt, I knew I could no longer choose her in every match. Without seeing her luscious lips, it was nearly too much to bare.

Nothing could stop me from my dream. I pick morphling every game. As soon as the match starts, he's all mine.

Do you imbeciles finally understand? Imagine the most perfect and radiant goddess in existence. Now imagine that there are two of her.

&amp;#x200B;

Each one of them is an unbelievably sexy queen, with her tight wooden ass. Now imagine them fighting. Pounding some lucky victim into submission.

Binding whatever.. -whoever they want with their sharp thorny ropes. Completely immobilizing them, while they do what they please.

Taunting them ever the while, in their incredibly sexy geographically ambiguous accent.

Just the promise that it might ever happen, that there will be a game where I can morph my pitiful model into my goddess is enough to keep me going.

In the meantime, every second I am forced to endure gazing at him, well its a virtual chastity cage, reminding me of my place and who I belong to.

I know release isn't an option, until the day when I see two of Mireska Sunbreeze.

&amp;#x200B;

I pick morphling every game. As soon as the match starts, he's all mine.

I'll have you know he is simply perfect, for serving my goddess.

&gt;I've  been relying on Unity's ScriptableObjects for all of the data in my  previous game project but wanted to try using JSON as I've been told  it's much easier to change for the sort of game I'm making.

Oh I see. I would have thought you loaded the JSON file through code (like System.IO), but you're using the Inspector.

I also made the mistake of starting with ScriptableObjects. For some reason, I was always scared of JSON. JSON is 100% the way to go, ScriptableObjects is a bit of a joke. You should also consider YAML for stuff like config files (i.e: user options).

&gt; So the file that parses the JSON would keep the strings only from the current language? Do I understand you correctly?  

Yeah, pretty much. 

&amp;#x200B;

In case you haven't already, you should also consider how you're going to do fallback languages (if fr\_ca (French Canada) doesn't have a translation for ""LOAD\_GAME\_TEXT"", fallback to fr\_fr (Real French) and use it's translation instead, if fr\_fr doesn't have the translation either, then fallback to English).",1577837085

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Just reading through comments and thought I had some insight on this one. I‚Äôve never been close to OPs situation, but while working on a car, the wrench slipped and I slammed the top of my hand into a mm thin piece of steel on the exhaust. It instantly severed every tendon for my middle finger on the top of my hand. The adrenaline and general pain blinded me from what happened. I just shouted and went to grab some super glue to close the wound. While reaching for the super glue I realized my hand wasn‚Äôt moving right. A closer look and I found I could squeeze my hand shut no problem but when I tried to open it, all but my middle finger would go. It was like I was staring right at it, in my head saying ‚Äúand go‚Äù but nothing would happen. Played with it the whole ride to the ER. They threw like 2 stitches in it and scheduled surgery, so for a week or so I worked (reassigned indoors to light work) and lived with my middle finger just not responding the way it should. It was bizarre.

The cut was on the top of my hand, an inch or less long, right behind the middle knuckle on top of my hand, almost perfectly horizontal. When I worked it, you could see the distal ends of the tendons move back and forth when I closed and opened my hand. If I felt my forearm towards my elbow I could still feel that side of things working and moving. Really put into perspective just how fragile we really are and and how quick an easily the flesh can be damaged by everything around you everyday.",1577837085

These last 7 months have been some of the most eye opening, excruciating amounts of pain I‚Äôve gone through. And emotions? Ooooh I‚Äôm their best friend now. Look, everyday is a struggle for me.

However I understand your frustration and it is definitely worth noting that that there are a substantial number of Filipinos who would do anything to get abroad including but not limited marrying foreigners for visas and permits. It is an unfortunate occurence and one that is sadly seen a norm in the Philippines. Most people won't turn a head if they hear that they're marrying for money, status, or to go abroad. 

I think its rooted in a need to make Filipino parents proud no matter what and to provide for the family. Though commendable the ends does not always justify the means in such situations. The huge economic disparity between the rich and the poor is also worthy of noting. It's a dog eat dog world in most poverty stricken places there. So marrying for success would not be under them. The whole Filipino system needs to be turned upside down gutted and started a new. Until Filipinos stop competing with each other and instead focus on themselves nothing will change. The worst enemy of the Filipino is other Filipinos.",1577837088

-  He claimed Russia was not a great geopolitical threat, when Mitt Romney said they were

-  He failed to act against them, when they invaded Crimea

-  When Assad used chemical weapons, killing more than 1,500 people. President Obama failed to enforce the red line, instead choosing to accept a deal with Russia to ‚Äúremove‚Äù all of Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons.

-  He cancelled a plan for ballistic missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic. The system would weaken the effect of the Russian offensive force and Iranian long range ballistic missiles to European allies.

-   In 2010 the Obama administration opted not to prohibit the Russian sale of the S-300s to Iran. The Russians delivered the systems to Iran and Iran promptly deployed them around its nuclear facility at Fordow.

-  He unfroze the assets of Iran, a Russian ally, to the tune of 1.5 billion (much of it in cash), and delivered it in the middle of the night.

-  He claimed that our federal elections could not be hacked, and that the 2016 would be the same as any other (Now, I don't believe that Russia had any substantial impact, but you do)

"EscapefromTarkov","t5_3aq6o","Insurance is underrated. Even if every person in the raid is quite ungraceful and decides to take all the gear they see, they can still only carry so many guns, so many items, etc. In addition, only some items are really even worth taking in terms of value-per-slot.

Armor, rigs, and backpacks are so impractical to carry out of a raid that people don't even touch them most of the time. The opportunity cost of carrying armor in a backpack vs. carrying 2 or 3 guns is too high.

Here is a list of items you will almost always get back:

Tactical Rigs

Armor

Scav Backpack

SSh 68s and Ratnik helmets

Headsets

AKs-74u

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't have a lot of money, I recommend primarily insuring helmets, headsets, Tactical rigs (with good repairability,) and backpacks. Weapons can cost a lot to insure and they are the least likely item to be returned because they have higher value-per-slot than the aforementioned items and can be placed into the sling slot. Pistols are often similarly picked up, even if they're low-value, because there is a dedicated pistol slot that most players don't fill before the raid, so they can pick up a pistol for virtually zero slot cost.

Also, if you really hate success, you can wear UNTAR armor and helmets. No one will pick those up since they're both garbage and bright blue.",1577837089

If women all decided collectively to stop swimming in the ocean, all shark attacks would be on men. This doesn't, of course, mean that a shark will only attack men.

You have falsely claimed that ""men are more likely to be attacked"" however the statistics do not make such a claim. The numbers simply say that men are attacked more, on average. The reason for this *could* be that people attack men more, but a large portion of it is because women know that's a dangerous situation for them to be in whereas men are less cognizant of the danger.

Therefore, it is skewed. It is not representative of what you claim it is.",1577837090

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

The experiences of facing serious illness and the enforced limit of death, as well as the loss of loved ones, really prompts reflection on how short, precarious, and precious our lives are.

The amazing things that humans have produced in spite of personal and collective suffering is profoundly moving. (Pyramids! Carved marble sculptures! Elaborate cities, ancient and modern! Technology to travel in space!) And how wonderful the earth itself is, from enormous forest trees to vast undersea worlds. We have all this all around us ‚Äî it‚Äôs unbelievable. It‚Äôs just stunning.

A few hours wandering in a holocaust museum or visiting an AIDS memorial hammers home what remarkable spirits of endurance people have in the face of deep suffering ‚Äî how brightly our passion for life, creation, and remembrance shines when it‚Äôs endangered. The artists, writers, scholars, and activists who raced against the clock when they knew death was not far off.

When I was a teenager, I wanted to die because of how I was treated. When I was a young adult, I sometimes wanted to die because I knew that people viewed me like I wasn‚Äôt even human (many still do), simply because of my size and shape and features.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","A handful from my game, some completed, some undiscovered (long):

The big one that some others stem from is the fact that I ran the same game with two groups at the same time, then brought them together for a single session where their in-game universes collided and combined, leaving behind one copy of every person seemingly at random. For instance, if Hank the Hillbilly died in a freak accident as a child in Reality A, but survived it in Reality B, Hank might suddenly disappear to the people who have known him in B, but the people from A wouldn't know the difference. The inverse being Hank suddenly appearing all grown up, much to the confusion of people from A. Similarly, sometimes things happen that change peoples' lives drastically, like starting a business or getting married, so if Jan is married to Delvin in A, but she suddenly disappears after the collision, it's possible she didn't die, but is from reality B and is still trying to run her Bakery in her hometown and has no idea who Delvin even is since she never took that trip in her 20s. Kinda confusing, great fun. Enough background now.

Player who had a backstory where he was an only child and his parents and entire temple were slaughtered by undead? Finds his mother and twin brother he didn't know about captured by slavers. They remember him and his father dying to the temple. Twin brother from R.A. died of illness as an infant, his parents never thought to tell him.

Player who is royalty whose father doesn't want the crown, but is forced to it by being an only child? Father and mother never met and married (both from R.B.). Mother has no idea who the daughter is, father willingly took the throne and assigned a diplomat's role to the daughter (who has a different mother, the new queen, also R.B.). 
Player's big goal from backstory is dissolving the monarchy so their father can be happy. Father actually no longer wants the throne and is unhappy but feeling trapped.

The BBEG from the first few levels of play? They have keys to a portal system that allows travel between Realities A-Whatever, so they're a recurring villain across all tiers of play and any number of tweaks and twists to stories and people that come from alternate realities. They're working together to unite the mirrored shards of the ""True World"" into one whole once again. Of course, they will set themselves up to rule said world afterward, using some high tier spell or other to make sure their own duplicate selves (at least some of them...dissension among the ranks anyone?) remain while everyone else becomes only one. The players also have the keys, the only items seemingly to have not melded with the collision of the universe.

Player whose sister was (much like club penguin) kil by an orc raid? The specific orc that reports say carried her off was one that had qualms about raiding in the first place and was going to tend to her wounds from another, but was discovered and had to leave her to die. 

The orcs that abandoned their attempts to civilize and went back to pillaging with renewed vigor? Pressured by a previously unknown frost giant tribe farther north than any other humanoids have gone. One trial by combat later, and someone shortsighted started leading the orcs and bending the knee. A few years and one sunk cost fallacy later, the frost giants come far less but the northern orcs are stuck with their lot to the distaste of the elders.

Player who left wizard college and took up adventuring to pay a cleric to hold his father's unidentified illness at bay since it won't be healed by anything she tries and keeps persisting? Comes back after two years of imprisonment in the game to find most of his assets have been sold as the cleric still tends to his father and now two others in the city. He still has a massive debt being built. That is until they learned that the acolyte of Apollo thing was a sham and the cleric of pestilence was keeping her patients under a Contagion spell and long conning their families for coin.

Hexblade who paints his character as a paladin eventually will be revealed to the party by his pact blade (grandfather's sword) being charged by his kills and eventually growing powerful enough to start fucking shit up in a conjured humanoid material form, that of his grandfather.

The pirate player who lost his father and crew to his father's vengeful former captain? Has royal blood from a long lost seafaring empire that will unlock the vault at the heart of a city on a hidden island.",1577837093

FYI:

From one website: [https://www.learning-mind.com/only-child-syndrome-signs-effects/](https://www.learning-mind.com/only-child-syndrome-signs-effects/)

From another website:  

* The kid has difficulties to mingle with others and make friends. He loves to stay alone and isolated.
* He is very shy.
* He generally talks to an imaginary friend and talks to himself.
* The maturity rate is slower than the normal kids.
* The kid does not share the problems and tends to be with it.
* He is not at all confident.
* He has serious issues with happiness and does not want to be happy.
* He is way too exceptional and does not behave properly with others.
* There is a lack of competitive attitude, and the child may be hostile or jealous.
* They seek attention all the time and gets irritated if not given.
* They are sometimes self-insufficient as well.
* They are very self-esteemed and emotional.
* They tend to bring prestige in everything.
* Faces huge problems in doing team work and often remains incapable of performing it.
* Does not want to share anything with others.
* Faces difficulties live their life by own.

No, it's still greed. Deliberate decisions aimed at exploiting people, many of whom (although not all, admittedly) lack the wherewithal to protect themselves, to enrich themselves at the expense of the exploited. 

Being Capitalism doesn't magically absolve people of their sins. Capitalism isn't a virtue, it's an economic system. An entirely amoral system that is primarily driven by self-interest.

A rough yearly rate would consist of $4500 for such a property (includes waste management, environmental charges, as well as residential rates). 

Landlord insurance is $1000 per annum. Maintenance fees is variable but let‚Äôs say $450 per year. Time spent managing it is harder to cost.

But you are right that it's not relevant to this specific question, because the basic plan in BC covers $1 million in damages caused by uninsured drivers. The real question is whether a) the friend is covered by an automative insurance policy at all (e.g. if they don't drive, they may not be) and b) if that policy would cover the type of damage caused here. The OP's friend may well be covered, but that coverage may only extend to injuries caused by other motorists and not to property damage, for instance.

"memes","t5_2qjpg","Hello /u/nick-nam3! Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

Thanks for understanding.

Personally, I think most resident evil games have great writing, that's why I like most of them, some may say that story is not important in games, but to me, a good story can be a big selling point, as long as the gameplay is at least passable, which in most resident evil games, it is more than passable.",1577837101

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","don't get fooled by ""must have strong servant to defeat X"". you can easily defeat him just by a whole low rarity team. though, you need to know how the strategy works. and for that case, i'll give you some hints:

- level up your low rarity servants, especially asterios and hans because they will be the essential key in here.

- put on a team which the frontline servants are asterios, taunters like georgios or leonidas, and someone who can cast skill seal. for backline, let hans and whoever it is, who are capable of dealing high damage to be on backline. i recommend someone from either rider, caster, assassin, or berserker class.

- use skill seal on him for 1st turn (someone like mata hari and benkei possess this skill) so that he will not cast his np on first turn.

-  if you go with benkei, use his taunt skill after yoi casted skill seal on him. do the same with other taunter like georgios ans leonidas. the main objective of doing this is to keep asterios alive, and charge his np.

- use asterios np whenever you can. if you're running out of taunters, use his def skill, or give him an evade from your master skill. do the same with hans.

- goetia's hit count is really high, which means you'll get a lot of np fill when you get hit, and this allow you to spam your np. with hans' buffs and asterios' debuffs, the damage you received should be 0 or close to 0. just keep spamming their np and your main executor will finish it eventually.


if you don't wanna go with that strategy above, look for someone who have heracles (grailed and high bonded ones are better) with his max bond craft essence equipped on him. keep 3 fodders on frontline, and heracles on backline. hit all the red buttons and there you go.",1577837102

Ingesting oxycodone with a fatty meal [decreases serum concentration by 18%.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8901078)

Ingesting morphine with a fatty meal [decreases serum concentration by 11%.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/022207s004lbl.pdf)

However, if that fatty meal happens to be A1 Cattle gene cheese, the Beta-Casomorphin-7 in the cheese provides it's own potentiation boost because cheese is a (very) mildly psychoactive opiate. So I have been eating my hydros with a string cheese or two at same time to boost absorption by at least 53%, PLUS the string cheese effect. 

In past before the nazi's cracked down on caring Pain Management doctors and I had palliative access to Percoset, I actually did the string cheese 30 minutes *after* and it was just like you said- it did seem to help move things along, and I didn't really notice that 18% drop in buzz that the scientific community recorded. That used to be along with some chocky milk too at T-30. :-)

Morphine I've noticed it was always better to take on an empty stomach and not eat anything for like a full hour or two after to avoid the 11% dip in buzz, and because Morphine creates a ton of nausea in almost anyone (unless anti-emetics are paired) ... yet MS creates a MONSTER food buzz when paired with a cheese tray an hour or two later after the initial wave of nausea settles.",1577837102

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Los ahorristas colocan d√≥lares en bancos para llegar a tiempo al 31 de diciembre, d√≠a en base al que se calcula el pago de Bienes Personales 
&gt; 
&gt;  **Los dep√≥sitos en d√≥lares del sector privado muestran un peque√±o repunte justo antes del cierre del a√±o**. En las entidades hablan del regreso de una fracci√≥n de los d√≥lares que salieron de los bancos este a√±o que **buscan reducir la carga del Impuesto a los Bienes Personales, ya que las tenencias en cajas de ahorro al 31 de diciembre de cada a√±o est√°n exentas del tributo****.**
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  Los dep√≥sitos del sector privado en moneda extranjera **subieron USD 459 millones entre el 16 y el 23 de diciembre**. **Es un monto √≠nfimo en comparaci√≥n con la cantidad de divisas que abandonaron los bancos despu√©s de las PASO, pero suman siete d√≠as h√°biles consecutivos de repunte**. Faltan computar las √∫ltimas tres jornadas financieras del a√±o para conocer la magnitud completa del repunte.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  **Desde el 9 de agosto, √∫ltimo d√≠a antes de las elecciones primarias, el stock de dep√≥sitos en d√≥lares del sector privado pierde un 43%**, por la salida de **USD 13.910 millones** que ahorristas temerosos a una confiscaci√≥n se llevaron al exterior, a cajas de seguridad o a sus casas.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  **La entrada de dep√≥sitos en los √∫ltimos d√≠as del a√±o es algo habitual. Plazos fijos y cajas de ahorro en moneda local y extranjera** [**est√°n exentos del pago de Bienes Personales**](https://www.infobae.com/economia/2019/12/25/cuales-son-las-inversiones-que-permiten-eludir-el-aumento-de-bienes-personales-justo-antes-de-fin-de-ano/)**. Tambi√©n bonos soberanos y otros activos**. Como se tributa sobre las tenencias al 31 de diciembre de cada a√±o, muchos ahorristas mueven sus d√≥lares a los bancos por algunas semanas a fin de a√±o. En los bancos llaman a esos movimientos ‚Äúpara la foto‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  ‚ÄúHace unos d√≠as que se empez√≥ a notar la entrada, cada d√≠a m√°s. **Es plata que entra por ventanillas pero tambi√©n que llega desde afuera del pa√≠s**. **Algunos transfirieron m√°s del 5% de lo que se necesita para no pagar la al√≠cuota de 2,25% por tenencias en el exterior, porque reci√©n el fin de semana se supo que con eso alcanzaba y no quer√≠an pagar de m√°s**"", dijeron en un banco de capital extranjero. ‚ÄúEs algo habitual, quiz√°s este a√±o se siente m√°s fuerte porque los dep√≥sitos se hab√≠an quedado mucho y por el aumento de la al√≠cuota de Bienes Personales que se aprob√≥‚Äù, agregaron.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  **Los d√≥lares guardados en los bancos tocaron un piso para el a√±o el 13 de este mes**. Llegaron a USD 17.895 millones, cuando un d√≠a antes de las primarias de agosto llegaban a niveles r√©cord de USD 32.491 millones. Desde entonces, lo que empez√≥ con un t√≠mido rebote de USD 14 millones en un d√≠a aceler√≥ hasta sumar USD 117 millones el 23 de diciembre. Y, seg√∫n cuentan en los bancos, en los d√≠as que siguieron la tendencia aument√≥.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  ‚ÄúVienen aumentando levemente, es un crecimiento del 2,9% versus noviembre entre nuestros clientes‚Äù, dijeron en otra entidad.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  Desde la promulgaci√≥n de la **Ley de Solidaridad Social y Reactivaci√≥n Productiva** **la al√≠cuota m√≠nima del Impuesto a los Bienes Personales pas√≥ del 0,25% al 0,50%, mientras que la m√°xima pas√≥ de 0,75% a 1,25%. Adem√°s, para las tenencias en el exterior el Gobierno decidi√≥ una al√≠cuota diferencial de 2,25%.** Sin embargo, en la reglamentaci√≥n se estableci√≥ que quienes repatrien el 5% de sus tenencias fuera del pa√≠s quedar√°n exentos de la al√≠cuota diferencial para pasar a tributar a la misma al√≠cuota que se aplica sobre las tenencias en el pa√≠s.

&gt; none of those countries are even governed by Kurds, nor are those countries governing for Kurds.

I was only using the Kurdish people as an example of the consequences of the Sykes-Picot Treaty from the 1910's and 20's. The treaty is the post-WWI precursor, along with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, towards drawing the boundaries we see today in the Middle East. The British and French Empires quite literally did not have any Middle Eastern influence/correspondence/voting on the Sykes-Picot Treaty. Honestly, by the end of WWI, the British and French Empires had actually allowed Russian and Italian imperial interests to be represented, recognized, and respected as well. Not a single Middle Eastern interest, imperial or not, was ever represented during these treaty agreements between European empires.

If Kurdish people were actually represented during the treaties, then it could be argued that they were not recognized with respect (for example, they were gerrymandered). That's not the case tho -- they weren't even represented from the very beginning. Whatever consequent states arise, like Iraq/Iran/Turkey/Syria, will inevitably arise due to European imperial interests, not out of the interests of the indigenous masses (remember, Kurdish people aren't the only ones neglected by the treaties). I think the bottom section of the Wiki page I linked on Sykes-Picot Treaties, with the section title of [The Agreement in Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes‚ÄìPicot_Agreement#The_Agreement_in_practice), talks about the various borders and their associated state governments.

And the simple thing is that if this is someone you can see yourself spending the rest of your life with, or at least long enough to be able to sell the house and not be underwater, then do it. And if for some reason you end up breaking up, sell the house and split the proceeds 50/50.",1577837103

"zen","t5_2qhmf","Echo John McRae's work regarding Bodhidharma. In his book The Northern School and the Formation of Early Ch'an Buddhism is reviews the historicity:

""All of the important components of the legend were added in the seventh and eighth centuries, just at the time when the Ch'an School's fundamental perception of itself was being formed. ...

The Hs√º Kao-Seng Chuan (Continued Lives of Eminent Monks) \[HKSC\] entry on Bodhidharma is relatively straightforward...'...At the time the practice of lecturing \[on the Buddhist scriptures\] had spread across the entire country, so that \[people\] often slandered \[Bodhidharma\] upon hearing the Dharma of samadhi (ting-fa)'.""

That lends credence to the idea that he operated outside the scriptures.

It isn't until we get to Fa-chung (Bodhidharma--&gt; Hui-k'o--&gt;Fa-chung that we see a heavy reliance on the Lanka:

""Fa-chung's main area of specialization was the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra....Our interest in Fa-chung derives from his emphasis on Hui-k'o's name in his own teaching of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra:...'\[The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra\] S≈´tra was originally translated by the Tripitaka Master Gunabhadra of the Sung and transcribed by Dharma Master Hui-kuan...Later, Dhyana Master \[Bodhi\]dharma *transmitted it* to \[both\] north and south \[China. Bodhidharma's\] teaching (tsung) was that of ""forgetting words, forgetting thoughts, the true contemplation of non-attainment.""'"".

I don't think Bodhidharma passed on the Lanka, at least not directly. Another clue comes from the book Buddhist Sutras by Kogen Mizuno, sums it up well I think:

""When Bodhidharma arrived in China, Buddhism there centered on scholarly inquiry, almost to the exclusion of religious experience and practice. The Zen Buddhism of Bodhidharma emerged as a part of the effort to remedy that imbalance. Within so-called Bodhidharma Zen, the people who learned doctrine and theory from the sutras and commentaries were referred to as chiao-chia, or sutra-family people, while those who actually practiced Zen teachings were called Ch'an-chia, of Zen-family people.

The Erh-ju ssu-hsing-lun (On the Twofold Entrance to the Way and the Four Types of Practice), a treatise attributed to Bodhidharma, describes Zen adherent's approach as 'to become enlightened to the fundamental spirit of Buddhism revealed in the sutras'. This statement means that Zen believers must discover the fundamental import of Buddhism for themselves and implies that at that time the followers knowns as the chiao-chia were unable to comprehend the fundamental meaning of the sutras despite diligent study"".",1577837103

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Part of this goes to having a television budget, albeit a big one.  You aren't going to pay the rates for an A-lister to be on set when you can't see his face.  You also want to film as quickly as you can, so you're going to need multiple units filming concurrently.  That's why many episodes are limited in scope and cast size.  But as a result, we are treated to the best looking; most cinematic show in TV or streaming.

Piss and vinegar yeah but there's a good amount of people older than us that like to stir the shit pot too.

 I think *IMHO before the torches and pitchforks come out* that the whole tribal acting and divisiveness is some people just don't feel they have a purpose and that joining the ""club"" either R or D, Sports rivalries, Playstation or Xbox etc. gives a small taste of being ""in the loop/making a statement"" and unfortunately instead of using that passion to make great changes for the better, most will just sit and fight in order to get that fleeting feeling of being ""right"" and having that ""got em"" moment.

"cycling","t5_2qhyi","I believe it will if you are conscious about it. They give you the ability to ‚Äúdrag‚Äù the pedal backward(hamstrings)  and pull it up (hip flexors), in addition to the strong push stroke (quads/glutes/calves). I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as effective as doing hamstring curls, Nordic curls or Romanian deadlifts but if you cycle in conjunction with those exercises I believe it can be an added benefit. My hamstrings usually get good work in after a good long ride. If you focus on spinning and try to have some level of force on the pedals throughout the entire stroke cycle it will recruit more muscle groups. But I think it‚Äôs important to point out that most of the force is on the push stroke and you should only pull back and up on the cleat with around 20-30% of what your pushing with. Due to the fact that you can‚Äôt hamstring curl as much as you can lunge. I believe the added stimulation of the hamstring is a benefit not so much from strengthening (progressive overload) but rather improved muscular endurance and it benefits from increased circulation in the muscle which is excellent for recovery. I‚Äôve had ACL and meniscus repair in the past and cycling has helped my legs tremendously, but I don‚Äôt have arthritis so proceed with caution.",1577837106

"PS5","t5_2s887","Yes, the switch sold best in 2019 because it is a newer console.

What I was speaking about is overall sales, the switch has surpassed the Xbox but it has not reached near playstations over 100,000,000 for the ps4. 

If Xbox brings the power and games and capitalizes on it then they‚Äôll be on top. The generations best consoles usually flip flop so there‚Äôs no saying the Xbox couldn‚Äôt come out on top for next gen

Just look at last gen, the Xbox 360 despite having much less sales the previous generation and a launch plagued by red ring errors and broken consoles still almost beat the ps3, there‚Äôs no telling which console will be the best. You can‚Äôt say for certain that Nintendo and a Sony will remain on top because that just isn‚Äôt the case, Sony won‚Äôt have to completely flop, there‚Äôs the chance Microsoft will just out compete that. Overall it looks decently even for next gen, if Microsoft is good at anything it‚Äôs learning their lesson, and now with full Spencer having control at launch this could be a great gen.

Sony doesn‚Äôt need to flop for the Xbox to succeed, that‚Äôs a logical fallacy, if one console has more power and better games at a decent price point then it‚Äôll sell more. That‚Äôs just how it works, we can‚Äôt speak in definitely, but from what I‚Äôm seeing here, Sony could be crippling itself long term with such a big power gap. If the Xbox launches with a better price points and an exclusive like halo infinite WITH more power then it could get off to a better start than Sony",1577837106

When does depression cross the line from pretty common to ""mental health problem""? I think it's subjective. As for the medication you're on, I think you definitely can't get out of that one. If they ask to list all of the medications you're on, and you don't list one of them, I think that would constitute a lie. If they just ask ""what medication are you on"" and not ""all"", then you can tell him which ones you are on, and omit one of them if you're sure that he will act unjustly with that information, but you definitely can't say ""These are all of the medications I am on: A, B, C"" while knowingly omitting one of them.

&gt;I don't really know to be honest, I've heard anecdotal evidence that if you remove the breast buds before HRT then nothing grows; however this is based on individuals who had some breast growth before HRT (e.g. gynaecomastia). If you don't have any breast growth currently, I don't think you can do much at the moment.

Looking up ""breast bud removal"" I only get results for some old controversial thing called the ""Ashley Treatment"" and comparisons to circumcision. Nothing for actual procedures that are still being done on people today. What terms should I searching?

&gt;You can probably get keyhole surgery before they grow much (i.e. the first 3-6 months) then they shouldn't grow much after that, however you will still get nipple growth / development regardless, so do bear that in mind.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

But so will a player with exceptionally good range, because he GETS to more balls to even have a chance to make an error on them.  Guys with no range don't even touch the ball and they get scored as base hits rather than errors.

Errors also don't, but should, penalize players for taking exceptionally bad routes or simply not having the range to get to a play most other fielders should have.  If the spirit behind the idea of an error is ""an out that should have been made, wasn't"", then why ignore badly missed plays?

And that's before we even get into home-field advantage awarding of error/hit, preferential treatment being given to veterans, etc.

"adultery","t5_2sjkv","Not necessarily. The post as it stands is incredibly vague about her age. Which I think is more than a fair point. It's awkward that you mention her being a teenager and flirting with you, which, by your own admission, happened 16 years ago. How was I to know that when you said:

&gt;For years she shamelessly flirted with me and I resisted; chalking it up to teenage hormones. Fast forward a few years and she's grown into a responsible and beautiful woman.

What you really meant was:

\*For years she shamelessly flirted with me and I resisted; chalking it up to her 18-19 year old hormones. Fast forward 16 years later and she has since grown into a responsible and beautiful 34 year old woman.\*

Secondly you say that you got married to your wife when she was 22 and your sister in law was 18. Well how long did you date your wife before you married her? It couldn't have been too long, less than a year. Or perhaps throughout the entire courtship you just never met her younger sister. It's the only way to justify meeting your sister in law when she was 18, 16 years ago, the same year you married your wife.  Again, awkward.

It just doesn't add up. Now you could be embellishing here, playing around with the ages and timeline to make the story more scandalizing, when you are indeed talking about a 34 year old woman that you've known for almost 2 decades, and has been flirting with you on and off for that long. Which case my apologies for not taking the 2 decade time span into consideration when I wrote my reply. Please forgive me. Or you are lying about her age. She's not that old, which means you did know her before she was 18, which would make you look a little bad, and me a little justified. Or your lying about the whole thing. PLOT TWIST there is no sister in law. Personally that last one is my favorite.

But let's say its the first two, you've put yourself in a situation where you are so deprived of intimacy with your wife, (based on your first post) that you think it's a good idea to flirt with you sister in law, who first flirted with you as a teenager (it's not clear if this was indeed 16 years ago or not). I feel sorry for you in a genuine way. I sincerely believe dead bedrooms or withholding sex is a form of abuse. No one deserves that. And instead of actually making choices to get out of that (which I admit isn't easy at all), or finding another form of outlet as far away from your wife as possible, you've decided on this choice. It's literally the most harmful and self sabotaging choice you can make. I hope you give thought about what you are doing, and just how toxic it is to you, your wife, and your formerly teenaged sister in law.

You could also hire an escort and role play. I'm sure they won't mind.",1577837108

Recipe: 

1. Boil 8.8 oz box of red lentil penne al dente. Set aside 2 cups of pasta water. 

2. In a sauce pan, melt 1.5 tbsp butter )save  0.5 tbsp for later). Sautee chopped garlic in it until translucent. Then add thawed spinach, pumpkin,   and pasta water. Cook  on low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring. 

3. Optional: add in spices. I added 2 tsp red chili flakes (very low heat, I will increase this next time), 1 tsp dried thyme, and salt after tasting. (If you salted the pasta water then it's possible you won't need salt here.) 

4. Combine sauce with pasta and sun dried tomatoes, and pour everything into a baking pan.  Top with parmesan and cheddar cheese. 

5. Toss panko breadcrumbs with 0.5 tbsp of butter and spread it over the top. 

6. Bake at 425 for 10 minutes, until topping is melted/lightly browned and pasta is bubbly.",1577837108

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","I did negative pullups for 6 months. Starting point was only one with an almost immediate drop that probably put me at risk for a shoulder injury. Eventually I got to 5 reps 6 seconds on the way down. 

At my best I got halfway to a pullup but never got my chin over the bar. I already was able to do 5 or 6 chinups and did increase my ability to 12. 

My biceps got huge. I developed stretch marks on my arms even though I ate at maintenance calories. I did lose a little belly and thigh fat which was a plus. But aesthetically I didn't want huge biceps or stretch marks. 

I really think because my biceps were already developed it was easier and more intuitive to make them do the work rather than learning how to activate muscles in my back I almost never used. Part of my pullup quest actually began with looking at photos of woman with back muscles I admired. 

Also in case it's relevant I am 5'1 and weighed in around 120lbs at the time. Big feet, wide shoulders, a larger frame for a short girl although I kinda hate saying it in case it sounds like a ""not fat just big boned kinda thing"".  I also tend to put on muscle fairly easily compared to many women. At least visible bulky muscle which isn't the same as functional strength. 

I have a real lack of patience about long term goals. I think maybe if I'd taken it a little more time building a foundation before jumping right to the hardest thing I'd have had better success. 

It sounds like you're more fit than I was when I started and perhaps your goals are different. Please don't think I'm trying go be discouraging. I'm just throwing my experience out there because I hear a lot of info and watch a lot of progression videos on YouTube that suggest it's near impossible to put on big bulky muscles as a woman unless you're some kind of professional bodybuilder or eating way over maintenance calories. 

Maybe for people with better rounded workout routines. Maybe for girls with different biology or hormonal makeup than me. I'm not really sure. Anyway good luck",1577837109

You can believe Israelis are pieces of shit. I frankly don't care. But there is no doubt that the 2006 war was started from the Lebanese side. 

One day, I had the unfortunate chance to be brought into a discussion. Lebanese friends that I consider extremely smart lost all forms of rationality, shouted, and could not present any form of rational argument.

You have to stop the denial. You can piss on Israel, shit on Israel, I don't care. But the ""victimization"" mentality I can't stand it.",1577837111

Alternatively you can buy pre-cut 80/20 yourself and google instructions. I've heard this way is time consuming and tedious, though cheaper.
Sim Labs is one of the best right now, and with shipping costs plus the seat (which isn't included) you'r probably looking at $1200-$1500
The good thing is they are fully customizable and will truly end up being your final cockpit.  One day I will make a purchase, but I don't see it actually happening for a few years.

As for the next level F-GT it's a good mid price option. I actually haven't switched it to the f1 style yet as I've been doing all GT. It's a nice option to have, but wasn't the deciding factor for me.",1577837111

"BattlefieldV","t5_2uxp8","Instantly take out an enemy tank, ""most of the time"". I don't like that idea. 

If you look at planes that take down a tank with one bomb, it is possible, but that takes some skill to drop the bomb. There is nothing tank can do other than hiding behind an obstacle or so. Giving same to another tank, it is matter of pushing button to one shot another tank, nope that doesn't sound right. 

If you are on a flank, and catch someone off guard, you already have a lead. Bt the time they find your position, they are already hit twice. Even though rest of the game takes dual, you will likely get on top. If they have an engineer to fix their tank, it is part of a team work, you lose it. If you don't have one, too bad. Your flank didn't work. I don't see anything wrong it it. 

Only thing that's not fair is the duals of a level 0 tank versus, max level one. But, that's part of playing tank class and upgrading it. I would possibly suggest improvement in there, so someone who wants to use level 0 tank isn't on the loosing side all the time. It is probably giving credit for someone who did level their tank but they should still have option to take down max level.

if one shot tank takedown exists, I bet all tank drivers will act how most recon players run. They will rarely push into objectives. When using support class, I usually push along with the tank, I push to objective and repair them as needed. If getting a shot cancels the repair, nobody would push objectives. Interrupted repairs would simply kill the incentive to even use it.. 

What you are suggesting is more a solo player's dream defeating teamwork. With that, I am perfectly fine with how things work now.",1577837115

In retail they can get rid of most things the bot is used for anyways.

For instance they offer lvl boost to max level which negates going to a third party to power level your character (usually through botting).  They also let you buy/sell gold directly through WoW tokens negating going to a 3rd party gold seller which acquires most of their gold through bots.

Blizz has already taken out a lot of the reason to bot the game in Retail.  They can continue to adjust if needed.

Also they just sue the shit out of those that are making botting programs.  I don't think it'll matter if you do it with a neural network or not once they get a wiff of you and you gain popularity.

See previous bot sellers legal battles with Blizz.  Riot did this as well with one of the biggest script sellers.",1577837116

You need a lens, that's all. I have a combination of wide angle and telephoto frames in this video. Depends on the look you are trying to achieve. What you do need for sure is a camera with an intervalometer. That tells the camera how often to take a picture. For example: I can set my intervalometer to a 2 second interval and 400 shots. The camera will take 400 pictures, 2 seconds apart. My job then is to set an exposure using my shutter speed (faster than my interval), aperture, and ISO. I use manual mode and change my shutter speed if I need to adjust for changing lighting. These series then go to LRTIMELAPSE and Lightroom for processing, exposure ramping, and deflickering.

I usually dated spirited ppl who would try to trigger me bc lm so mellow. If l know you're delibrately trying to trigger me, then lm going to take you less seriously. If l know you're genuinely passionate, then l will engage. This was random, but w/e.

Some infj commented on another thread that l've also been reflecting this year. When you're good/try to be perfect most of the time, people will notice the 1 time of 1000 and point it out like that's your entire legacy. Simple minds conclude that you're wicked or failure with ""Oh, l knew you weren't perfect as you pose yourself as."" The most messed up/corrupt ones go out of their way to point that out, bc they feel like crap themselves. This is why it's easier for most ppl to be wicked or ""bad."" You're no longer considered wicked when you do one good thing. This is how narcissists and sociopaths thrive and get away with all their ""bad"" behavior. This is sheep mentality, but it's human nature. This is why figures like Jesus or Moses even suffer repurcussions with their pride or impatiently slamming that rock one time when he was frustrated. Even infjs need to evolve. It's time for a little bit of gray gray and realism. You also relate/connect with ppl better that way. Dgaf. Embrace a little FI. Do what you want vs what you should once in awhile. As long as your good outweighs the bad, that's what matters.",1577837119

Forse anche lui quindi ha dato forfait perch√® tu non sei uscito o forse pensava di farlo e per questo ti stanno stressando
A parte tutto io ho passato il capodanno a casa da solo a vedermi Ghostbusters in TV che √® 100.000 volte meglio del trenino di Capodanno e di YMCA del cazzo
Chi mi vuole bene mi ha mandato gli auguri e io ho fatto lo stesso

You put in a photo of just your grandson. That‚Äôs weird and hurtful, I don‚Äôt even understand the thought process that would cause you to do that.
