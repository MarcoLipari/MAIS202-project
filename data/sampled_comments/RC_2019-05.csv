"Advice","t5_2qjdm","as a daughter of my non biological father, 

1) that opinion of hers is true and will not waver. She might get mad at you for something else, might not talk to you for years of you have wronged her that badly, but she is saying that so confidentally now, take it at face value and dont question her on this regard anymore. If you do that might be the only way to push her too far.

2) if she ever were to want to meet her biological father, it is curiosity, not an attempt to replace you. You are irreplaceable to her already.

3) your ex is an asshole, sorry she made you worry that much and tried to hurt you. I hope you can sort out your feelings soon.

4) i look a lot like my non biological dad. I still find it more than just funny that him and I are the only ones having curly blond hair. All the others are straight, thick and darker. Edit: what I wanted to say is: she might look like you because she makes the same faces and thats nurture. She might make the same gestures, that is nurture. She has your intellogence because you spark her curiosity for learning and encourage her. You are her biggest supporter and her biggest role model if she takes so much after you. And all what she is like you, is PURELY out of true, pure and innocent love. I am serious here. What good is a child that has the same hair or nose if it resents you and tries to forcefully be the exact opposite of you because it is difficult (dont want to say a child can be hating their parent except for the parent being abusive). It is one of the biggest love letters if she is like you. And again: looking similar can happen without DNA too -- the way she takes care of herself, her muscles she uses while making faces will tug on her bones a bit. The look and spark in the eyes of people. Those are far from DNA. Please dont reduce her to DNA. She is yours.

4) NURTURE &gt; nature. She being like you, behaving like you, having personality traits like you is because you have been an awesome role model to her, you have always been one of her most lived and trusted and respected humans on earth and thus, she has been taking a lot of your mannerisms when she was little. You will be able to parent a really wonderful kid and it will not matter a few years down the line what your ex did or didnt prove. Your daughter might even have a better relationship to you than her in a few years (as do I at the moment). 

5) though my dad has always known he wasn't my father (i was already 1y/o, duh!) he has been there in my life. He kind of adopted me legally (he is written on my paperwork) and I am glad he is. He was disciplining me, encouraging me, listening to me. He did lots of shit as well, as a normal parent always does and shitty parents do more, but that never made him less of a father to me.

I found out when I was 14. It took just as many years to find out who my biological father is and I still havent made the decision if I want to meet him. But after the stories I heard, I for myself would love to prove to myself that NURTURE &gt; nature.

Enjoy your daughter and dont fred the DNA.

Edit: talk to a lawyer regarding custody. DNA test doesnt automatically take away your privileges and responsibilities, if it does: fucked up system. But the lawyers know best. First impressions might be found here: r/legaladvice

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","Sounds like me. Also self taught, started when I was 16 and I’m 29 now and its still a bit frustrating. I got so frustrated when I was younger that I stopped for a long time. 

Now that I’ve gotten a-lot better, it’s really fun just jamming for hours or to a backing track or with friends. I can finally play along to songs I like! Much fun.

Best advice I can give you is to actually Teach Yourself to play and don’t just practice random stuff haphazardly. 

Have a diverse exercise cheat sheet so you can practice more things together and not get bored,

Edit: I wouldn’t use youscian at all really. And use resources like justinguitar as a text book you can refer to for theory not for practice. Practice what you like and you won’t get bored.",1556668800

"alcoholicsanonymous","t5_2s3xd","I didn’t want to ruin my life either. Nobody wants to ruin their life.  

The reality is, I have a disease called alcoholism. If I didn’t treat it, my life would continue to get worse.  Weird thing is I didn’t want to treat.  I thought I was choosing to drink, the reality was that I had lost that choice years prior.  

If your wife is anything like my girlfriend was, she will leave you, my girlfriend did.  She didn’t take half my stuff though I had nothing she wanted. 

The good news is that in theory at least, you can get off the elevator anytime you want.  The reality for me was that it took a year living in a car, unemployed and unemployable to get the willingness to do this. I didn’t have the guts to panhandle so it was rough.  During the last 4 years I drank I thought I was willing to get sober but didn’t do what was suggested, and my life continued to get worse.  Once I committed to do this thing my life started changing. I’m pretty happy to live in a house today. 

AA isn’t the only to get and stay sober, it is what worked worked for me.  I don’t know about other ways, but I sure see a lot of success in AA.  Give it a shot for 90 days, I’ve never seen it hurt anyone. 

The reality is that if you are an alcoholic and you don’t do something, your life today is probably as good as it will ever be.",1556668800

3) Your now incentivizing aggressive behavior like we saw from Atuesta (running up with a push)

4) You then fine Roldan for taking to long to get off the field even through he stayed on because they were checking VAR. Roldan taking his sweet time is not what I remember from that

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Industry in China is still deeply entwined with the state. The notion that China just suddenly became capitalist is pervasive and misguided.

That's called state capitalism with a centralised planning system not socialism. 

&gt;Socialism refers to state ownership of the means of production

No, the workers own it, not the state. What usually happens is that the state assumes control over the means of production via authoritarianism. 

&gt;The Chinese government and communist party directly run the economy 

CCP is about as Communist as the Democrat People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is Democratic. 

&gt;China is actually less socialist than Nordic model countries in the realm of wealth redistribution and tax rates.

Social democratic societies such as the Nordic Model operate under a capitalist framework. They just have generous welfare nets. 

&gt;Perhaps you can't actually call China socialist, perhaps they're something new and unique.

Not even Chinese people consider their government socialist. Words have meanings. 

Even under a ""state owned system"", the wealth needs to be redistributed and funneled into public welfare systems. The state should also not profit off of the enterprises and industries they own. 

To put it simply, you are incorrect in your assessment. China is a ruthless, authoritarian capitalist society that will break any rules needed to get ahead. That's why they are where they are in such a short span of time.",1556668802

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;However comes into being doesn't properly apply to how we understand the universe.  Our current scientific understanding is that there is no point in time when there wasn't a universe.  This gets tricky sure as this isn't necessarily implying an infinite time into the past.  

You’ve just either strawmanned or misinterpreted by position.  The universe may very well be infinitely old.  That would have no effect on my argument.  I am not talking about infinite temporal regression, but rather a regression of hierarchical cause.  

Furthermore your idea of how change is defined isn't a scientific one either.  Non-being to being aren't scientific terms 

I never said they were.  Lots of things are not scientific terms.  But that does not make them less valid.  They are *philosophical* terms, which science is a sub grouping under.  

&gt;nor does potentiality and actuality exist in the way you are using them either.

Proof?

&gt;Because here is the thing.  A lot of this argument relies on an area where we are very much bound by the limitations of our ability to examine it.  It is easy to say that some thing can't be the case but science is always built on the idea that more information may arise that will change views.  As such the claims about what matter can't or can do and the earliest moments of reality are literally using our ignorance to try to argue a position.

The ""kill the head and the body dies"" trope is incredibly tired and boring. They couldn't really do anything about that because of how they wrote the episode, but whatever.

The ""the villain goes to kill the hero himself, leaving himself vulnerable to attack"" trope is incredibly tired, boring, and makes no sense given the NK has no characterization.

The latter -- the NK having little to no character -- is source of one of my major gripes: killing the NK doesn't feel meaningful. He's not an interesting character. He is literally a one-dimensional character whose only goal is to murder humanity, for reasons that are really not themselves that interesting.",1556668806

I was thinking about this the other day. How I wish it was normalized for girls to masturbate. Boys start before the age of 12, girls are encouraged not to.

For girls, once you start having sex, it takes a while to warm up to. For the first few years of my sex life it wasnt about me. Hell, I still dont make it about me and I'm 30. I wish I had started masturbating earlier and learned what I liked. And learned that I deserve pleasure and that I can in fact ASK for it. I can Expect it. Sex is a 2 person dance after all.

Even though my daughter grew up in a very clothesfree way (consistent family nudity, consistent nudist resort trips, consistent visits with nudist friends), she dropped out right around puberty.

&gt;The Master said, ""Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.""

This is from [*Analacts*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects).

This is from *The Rhapsody of Leisured Emotions* (闲情赋) by [Tao Yuanming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Yuanming). I cannot find d an ""official"" translation so here's my stab at it:

Edit: to all the left wing extremists and violent apologists;


“In an essay lamenting what he described as the intractable income inequality of the American economy, Senator Sanders declared: “These days, the American dream is more apt to be realized in South America, in places such as Ecuador, Venezuela and Argentina, where incomes are actually more equal today than they are in the land of Horatio Alger”

Despite receiving trillions of dollars in oil revenue over recent decades, Venezuela is in the midst of an unprecedented economic collapse, owing precisely to the redistributionist programs that Sanders has extolled as a model for the U.S. economy. Grocery store shelves are barren, hospitals have no access to vital medicines, rationing is under way, and riots have begun to coalesce in the streets of Caracas.

I think it's really fucking stupid. Doesn't mean I didn't find it cool. While I was watching the episode, as soon as I figured out no one was dying when they should be, I don't think anyone is dying at all, I kinda just accepted it was gonna make me mad if I wanted everything to make sense and I decided to make memes of everything. I literally screamed ""N-NANI?!?!"" at the screen when the Nightking realized Arya made a 200IQ play. The whole episode was stupid. The whole season is gonna be stupid, and the ending is gonna be stupid. I've watched this show for years upon years and was so hyped for this season because I thought it was gonna redeem itself, but no. The show died when Stannis did.

"UFOs","t5_2qhds","The same comment applies here that I put to another user here. This is less about the videos themselves, and it goes to the credibility of who gave you the videos. 

Mr. Elizondo falsely/erroneously misled DOPSR on the form. If you find his misleading/erroneous/false/inaccurate intentions with that acceptable, and you feel now he is preaching gospel to you and me without erroneous information attached, all for the sake of getting these videos out? That's a horrible way to look at this, and what I refer to as the I WANT TO BELIEVE SYNDROME. He misled the agency on how the videos would be used. In addition, he either misled about the subject, or he didn't, and he knows after thorough analysis, these are highly advanced UAVs aka drones. Either way, it's problematic. 

You can not sacrifice the greater picture here, all because you have a few FLIR videos.  The field, the subject and the truth deserves so much more.  If some of you are happy with that? Cool!

Land prices are dirt cheap due to land taxes

With the given fact:

Cities are not taxed by provincial or federal level due to their holdings/income

Is it not in the cities best interest to buy these properties at dirt cheap prices to then re-purpose and do something with, be it lease or turn it into a park. A business can lease these properties for the purpose of revenue generating, or a resident could lease it for personal use. Either way, you have an impermanent ownership structure that looks a lot like China's, or in this case, Hong Kong. which has a housing shortage not due to land shortages (60% of the land is parks basically), but due to city greed.

Sexuality is who you go to bed with.

Gender in who you go to bed as.

For instance, I am a queer trans woman. Queer is describing who I sleep with and date. Trans woman is who I am.

EDIT:

There are also terms to add on to genders:

• Cisgender - someone who's gender aligns with their assigned gender at birth. Example: a cisgender man is someone who, when born, was assigned a male.

• Transgender - someone who's gender does not align with their assigned gender at birth. Example: Me! When I was born, the doctors said I was a boy. When I turned 17, I told them they were wrong. Now I'm a girl.",1556668812

It was the most advanced, effective, and secure ammo-storage compartment of any AFV design used in the war until the M26 arrived; hell, the Wehraboo’s mighty Tiger II literally stacked 88mm rounds horizontally in their outermost armor bulkhead, and had a tendency of vaporizing itself even when knocked in the side by an 85mm HE found, a large reason why so few were recovered intact.",1556668813

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","It's the worst when this thread falls on a Tuesday. I just reviewed a quarter of the books I read this month this morning. Books I finished in April:

* **Abbott** by Saladin Ahmed &amp; Sami Kivelä - An urban fantasy graphic novel set in Detroit in the early 1970s following a black female investigative reporter as she unravels a supernatural mystery. Great story and superb art. Used on the Graphic Novel bingo square (hard mode).

* **Who Fears Death** by Nnedi Okorafor - A post-apocalyptic story set in a future African-styled land following a young woman who is the product of rape who has magical abilities. A confronting and unforgettable story. Used on the Afrofuturism bingo square.

* **Black Leopard, Red Wolf** by Marlon James - An African themed fantasy following a man called Tracker as he travels the land on various jobs. Brutal and unflinching from difficult content. The first half is pretty slow but the second has great momentum. I highly recommend the audiobook. Used on the #Ownvoices bingo square (hard mode).

* **The Magician King** by Lev Grossman - The second book in the Magicians series. This great follow up to the first book is a riff on The Voyage of the Dawn Treader with the usual Magicians broken characters looking for happiness in the wrong places. Used on the Ocean Setting bingo square.

* **Babylon's Ashes** by James S.A. Corey - The sixth book in The Expanse series was scattershot and hard to get into for me for the first two thirds, but ramped up to a very satisfying ending. This book does not fit a single 2019 bingo square.

* **Days of Infamy** by Harry Turtledove - An alt history that asks what would have happened if Japan had invaded Hawaii after attacking Pearl Harbor. An interesting thought piece with workmanlike prose. I'm not sure if I'll read the next book in the duology. I don't think I consider it SFF enough for me to use for bingo.

* **The Dragon Book: Magical Tales from the Masters of Modern Fantasy** edited by Gardner Dozios &amp; Jack Dann - A high-quality anthology of stories about Dragons. I used five stories from this for bingo, but didn't use it for hard mode because it would have blocked out too many authors, including two potential Australians. 

* **Age of Assassins** by R.J. Barker - An assassin's apprentice with a clubfoot and his master are dragooned by a queen into hunting assassins trying to kill her son. Great main characters hooked me, and the world was interesting, but the bad guys were just too damn arch. I might read the next book anyway. Used on the Disability bingo square (hard mode).

* **The High King** by Lloyd Alexander - The last book in The Chronicles of Prydain ties everything up nicely with a fully matured Taran. A charming series. Read it to a kid or read it yourself for fun. Used on the Final Book in a Series bingo square.  

My plan for bingo this year is just to fill squares disregarding hard mode, and then maybe replace the ones that aren't hard mode later. There are a couple of hard mode squares that I think I might not be interested in perusing, though.

If they can show him having manipulated the others into fighting the living as is theorized by OP, including having manipulated things to bring him to power, i think they can set him up just fine.

To complete the heel turn he'd have to kill Dany and/or his siblings to reveal his true nature.

I can't quite connect all the dots, but i do think there has to be some last swerve of this caliber to justify having the night king threat end so early. i figure most likely it's something like this, or at the least, it would involve dany nuking KL and forcing Jon to bring her to justice or something. I don't like that idea necessarily either, so Bran being the final boss would be both surprising but also not completely illogical.

I've spent a ton of time this season and the end of the last season internally screaming ""WHY ISNT BRAN TELLING EVERYONE EVERytHING?!"" and chalked it up to shit writing that wanted to maintain suspense.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","Basically you want to draw through your deck either naturally (usually the best way since you mostly want the combo for control) or by using Myra’s after you assemble the combo pieces. 

Combo pieces: Leeroy, Scheme (4 stack at minimum, 7 stack for the mega combo), Wondrous Wand (need two of these for mega combo - which requires a Tog shadowstep play earlier). 

The normal combo after emptying your deck is: Leeroy, Scheme, Wand for 9 mana and 24 points of charge damage. 

If absolutely necessary you can hold your 3 zero mana Leeroys for two turns and do a full 30 damage OTK (2 full cost plus 3 freebies) but if the opponent finds a taunt you’re probably done unless you somehow still have a Prep and Sap or something. Basically waiting two turns for 30 damage is literally only relevant vs control shaman and you better hope they didn’t RNG into rain of toads or something. 

Mega combo has similar mechanics but is much more of a pain in the ass to set up and is therefore only relevant vs super sweaty control warriors. You need to shadowstep Tog to pickup a second Wand and get your Scheme up to at least 7. This gets you 42 burst from hand plus a minimum of 6 from the shuffle turn and is basically impossible to play around. 

I just posted a lot of words but honestly the normal combo is pretty easy to pull off and the setup is mostly tempo neutral at worst. Scheme in the bottom 5 is the nightmare which is why Lab Recruiter is in the deck to give an extra three turns for a bottom deck Scheme to grow.",1556668818

It doesn't all come down to math, people do have choices or possibly untested strategies.

I do prefer lists that show metas based on how much people are playing them and how often they win but it's all people's reaction to how to game is now and what everyone else chooses to play. The correct way to play is just know what everyone else is playing and stand up to it.

I also don't really like infinite possibilities. RDW is going to exist because aggro has to exist otherwise that universe probably isn't playing Magic right assuming we share the same cards.

It started with failing out of uni, I realized then that 4 years of school was way too much because I couldn't see the finish line, so I decided a 2 year diploma was the way to go. I powered through and graduated but not without some slip ups along the way. I've been stuck in a pattern now of never being able to crack the 2 year mark with any company. 

I've been with 4 different companies since 2012 and have been unemployed for about a year in that period.  Most of my career up until my current position was in construction management.  I thought the excitement of day to day would help me stay focused but that demon from uni showed up again and I'd struggle to keep momentum when the end goal was 3-5 years away, which lead to my performance slipping. I made a pivot recently and have been in estimating and am a month away from that elusive 2 year milestone with my current company. Stuck in an office which sucks but a tender only lasts 4-8 weeks and then there is new project to work on. Its easier to stay motivated when I have a hard deadline and its more of a colaborative team position so the additional support from others is a huge help. All in all it sucks going through the process but it helped me figure out what works for me and what doesn't.

And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It’s crazy.

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","I always come into these posts to say that it's perfectly okay to be out about your kink. People in this sub definitely get worked up about it and the top responses to these things almost always happen to be ""How dare you share that your kinky with...! You're a terrible person!""

Sometimes kink bleeds into our lives in ways that just isn't easy or normal to hide. If it's just our secret bedroom thing that only pertains to our sex lives, it's one thing. But if it's a lifestyle choice you make that affects your normal day to day life in noticeable ways, then yeah I think that's a very different and okay thing to come out about.

I'm very out about my kink. I was out to my cohort in grad school. I lead a kink group for students and other similar aged people at the time. So when people talked about their lives and free time, leading a kink group is naturally what I shared (which leads to being out about it by default).

Although I haven't ever been treated too differently after I came out, I generally respond by continuing to be an unabashed version of myself. If people got rude, I'd tell them they were being rude or inappropriate to me and firmly shut down the things they were doing that treated me that way. Lay down the law, because you have boundaries!

"ValveIndex","t5_r4yhp","I haven't gone eyes-on with either of those, but your screenshot of XTAL's sales pitch is the telling one in the case of Index. Valve gave us a slideshow presentation at the start of the Index event with very specific images breaking down how subpixel density and pixel fill factor look on the microscopic level. As in, we saw exactly how the pixels were arranged on Index's LCD panels to account for that ""50% higher"" fill in both respects. Looking at the XTAL is a good way to get a screenshot sense of what Valve is advertising with its custom LCD production. Whether that really plays out in a use case is another story, one I'm not comfortable delivering a verdict on just yet.

I really wish I'd had my Vive Pro side-by-side to compare, because it was easy in the moment to lose perspective on the perceptible difference between the two. It wasn't until I got back home and dug back into Job Simulator, which was demoed on Index, that I was at least comfortable enough to say ""Index at least looks a LITTLE better than this.""",1556668822

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So, so many men do not understand this. You can SMELL the preying vibes coming off them when they approach you and try super super hard to impress you. It is super tiring and boring to talk to. I will happily chat to anyone, literally anyone, if they're just chill and being themselves and having a good time.

The other thing is that sometimes men try this, and even though they get better at conversations etc, they still think it's unfair or something when they don't get a girlfriend in like a week. It isn't about being ""friendzoned"" because you're the worst, it's the fact that not everyone will be your perfect bloody match. Think about how many people you meet and either think are just okay, or don't like that much. Then apply that same statistic to finding a partner, and heighten it a bit because you have to REALLY like someone and click with them to want to put your face close to their face (maybe unless drunk idk). It is NORMAL to struggle to find a good partner, and women struggle with this too, everyone does.

Oh yeah also being ""nice"" and ""respectful"" is literally the bare fucking minimum for being a good partner. Like, that's great, but it doesn't mean the universe owes you a partner. Everyone in my life who I choose to associate with on any reasonable level is ""nice"" and ""respectful."" Doesn't mean they are automatically my dream person.

Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.

The appearance of your genitals has nothing to do with your interests, hobbies or personality.

Anyone who talks about some random persons penis is a creep, even if it’s as a joke. Reverse the genders and you’ll see how it’s so fucking creepy and gross. “Haha i bet her pussy loose” “I bet her pussy lips hang out of her panties” as a reasoning behind a behavior or hobby is fucking creepy.

The “jokes” really aren’t funny anymore and it’s becoming a real issue I think. It’s just making men feel bad about them selves, and a way for people to be straight up assholes and cover it up with “i was joking bro”.",1556668823

Some do, but I would say, based on what you've said, it doesn't sound like it. Before you said you broke up with her because it didn't feel right, so you were likely right then. What you need to do is sit yourself down and think about whether or not you can continue this relationship. Can the good outweigh the bad or is there too much bad?

"Throwers","t5_2s97a","So I’ve flip flopped on this a couple of times reading through other responses. Personally, I think I come down on it like this.

Ophelia Rain can post whatever she wants on her IG. She’s clearly a collector and a casual thrower (I’m obvs not for the gatekeeper argument calling her a fake thrower). I think as a community we should do what we can to make this as welcoming a place for female throwers, but part of that is respecting when members of the community decide to express themselves in ways that might be a little more suggestive. 

As for Recess reposting... I’m personally not a fan. It’s Tyler’s brand; he can do what he wants with it. But I think as a brand that does market itself to younger audiences (and produces the beginner throw we as a community recommend to everyone including kids), he shouldn’t have put this on his brand’s account. If he reposted on a personal account, I wouldn’t have a problem with it. If he posted here to r/throwers with an NSFW tag I wouldn’t have had much of an issue with it. But since it’s on Recess’s official IG, it feels more improper and awkward. 

Do we as a community have a responsibility to censor this stuff? No, I don’t think so, at least not for content like that which isn’t all that lewd. Maybe if it were more graphic but that photo wasn’t all that bad. But I do think brands should be more careful with their official accounts on social media and not use them as they might personal accounts.

Edit: said would when I mean’t wouldn’t have an issue with Tyler posting this to a personal account",1556668824

Having Male Majins have a natural 5-10% increased base defense simply losing that buff would mean playing as a Male Majin isn't akin to asking to die in 5 hits and is still not as broken as the other characters.

#LML Project's Tech is Named a Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Solution for 2019 by Retail CIO Outlook Magazine.

Retail CIO Outlook is a US based print and online publication that covers various enterprise solutions which can redefine the retail business goals of tomorrow. The magazine aims to bring their readers the latest trends in the industry on the most happening solution providers, and allow high level executives across industries to share their insights. Their April edition of the magazine looks at the *Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Solution Providers - 2019*, which are at the forefront of delivering distinct AI-powered solutions to retailers. A distinguished panel comprising of CEOs, CIOs, VCs, and analysts, along with the editorial panel of Retail CIO Outlook have selected the Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Solution Providers, and GNY.io the project from the team bringing Machine Learning to Lisk in the form of the LML sidechain (Lisk Machine Learning) has featured.

The magazines coverage listed some of the elements of the GNY tech that enabled it to place within the top ten.

**(1):** As a self-learning cognitive engine, GNY is capable of predicting consumer purchase behavior and assisting companies in targeting buyers with personalized offers for desired actions.

**(2):** The platform can be connected seamlessly with the retailer’s POS or CRM system and be fed with the data about consumers. 

**(3):** It can predict what customers may buy next. Not just the power to trace loyal customers, but retailers can also send personalized messages across various channels like e-mails, push notifications, and apps to influence a purchase. 

**(4):** In implementation tests the GNY tech when utilised by a media company was able to increase user interaction and also raise subscriber count by 120%.

**(5):** Gny's machine learning platform is capable of recording, maintaining and processing consistent data securely without leaving the chain, making it secure and unhackable. The world’s first truly decentralized machine learning platform within a blockchain.

We can look forward to this tech coming in the future to the Lisk ecosystem in the form of Lisk machine learning. With this I can see the GNY team focusing on enhancing their technologies further and helping their customers reap even more benefits.

You can read the the feature on Gny's placement within Retail CIO Outlook's Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Solution Providers - 2019 **[HERE](https://artificial-intelligence.retailciooutlook.com/vendor/gnyio-predicting-consumer-behavior-with-ai-and-blockchain-cid-418-mid-48.html)**, and the full list of the top ten projects is **[HERE](https://artificial-intelligence.retailciooutlook.com/vendors/top-artificial-intelligence-solution-providers-2019.html)**

*****
&gt; The four-page letter that Mr. Barr sent to Congress two days later gave little detail about the special counsel&amp;#039;s findings and created the impression that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s team found no wrongdoing, allowing Mr. Trump to declare he had been exonerated.

&gt; When Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report was released on April 18, it painted a far more damning picture of the president and showed that Mr. Mueller believed that significant evidence existed that Mr. Trump obstructed justice.

&gt; The senior department officials also found Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s rationale for stopping short of deciding whether Mr. Trump committed a crime to be confusing and contradictory, and they concluded that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report showed that there was no case against Mr. Trump.

   Also, I try to suspend a lot of disbelief as far as military and martial and commentators sense tactics go. This show touts girl power to the enth degree especially lately and that’s where Lyanna Mormont and such comes from. Don’t have much of an issue with that. Just think that Aryas been pumped up entirely too much. She was a half trained assassin who spent way more time getting her ass kicked than kicking ass. As I said, Jaime or Theon killing the NK would’ve made much more sense than Arya doing it. It just didn’t fit for me. 
    The crypt scene was a huge waste. The fact that dead Starks came out of their resting place to kill should’ve been presented differently, not to mention, what’s the statute of limitations on the NK resurrections? Those were 100+ year old dead bodies. 
    I did like how Melisandre died however. Her purpose was carried out, she took her amulet off and her very old body gave up, that could’ve been slightly more epic but whatever. I understand that our lead cast can’t die unceremoniously, but soldiers die with no pomp or circumstance all the time. 
   There were things done right, and things done wrong. The music and cinematography were completely on point, it was the storyline that I disliked, especially the whole Walking Dead in the library experience Arya had....very cheap. 
    And I’m expecting shit for this, but halfway through this season already and I am not liking what I’ve seen thus far. After S4, the show went downhill. I still love it as a whole though.",1556668825

Let's go all out and embrace the video game world. The NBA and video games seem to have the same general audience already, why not further blur those lines? 

Getting back to back blocks on the same player in the same possession gives your team a red shell and automatically forces the opposing coach to sub out that player in shame at the next dead ball and keep them on the bench for at least five minutes of game time. 

Maybe add rewards for consecutive made shots of the same type being worth more or less. Hit three ""three's"" in a row and unlock a holographic power star. Power stars grant you +1 points per made shot, +0.5 points per assisted shot, and immunity from foul calls for 30 seconds.

I've been trying to understand what was actually going on during the cold war in SA, and how people in the US and abroad felt about it, as it's not something that's taught in US schools. 

For example, was the coup against Arbenz in Guatamala viewed similarly? 

Do people believe Armas was better than Arbenz? I've heard people say this and all the other similar coups in SA were victories for freedom and democracy,  but in every case I've read (guatamala, hondurous, chile, nicaragua) the people who replaced the communist/socialists were far more repressive and anti-democratic than those they replaced.

"JonWinsTheThrone","t5_yoyii","I've seen an argument that some of Tyrion's recent ""mistakes"" / ""stupid plans"" (thinking bringing a wight to Cersei would change her mind, trusting that he changed her mind), was actually him manipulating Dany into fighting the Night King. He figured if Dany saw the wights, she would understand why they needed to be defeated and would join her forces with Jon's, and he figured she would be more likely to stay true to that if she believed Cersei would hold up her end of the bargain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why he didn't think about the crypts being a non-ideal hiding place when fighting an army that raises the dead is still a question without a great answer. But I don't think he's actually been made as stupid as he's letting Dany think he is.",1556668826

If you were to take a cup of cream and heat it you’d see it churn itself into heavy dense cream on bottom and light watery cream on top separated by very precise lines.

The effect occurs during pasteurization and is the main way milk companies separate and package everything from heavy cream to skim milk. You can also climate control your cows to save some steps - the warmer the environment the lighter the cream she will produce. You can take this all the way down to chilly temps to make a cow produce iced cream from the udder, and if the cow is brown you can get chocolate iced cream. Strawberry cows are harder to find naturally, so often times farmers just use hair dye to pinken their cows cows to make them produce strawberry milk or cream.",1556668828

We had to rehome him too and he is with an elderly with Dachs experience now too! The two are very happy together, he bit his new owner on day two but things have improved since.
But not a day goes by that I don't think about him or miss him. I miss him so much and I feel so guilty although I know we tried to do everything right; Dog trainer, vet bills, even saw a dog psychologist. 

And than there is David killing a dog with smaller teeth than a Dachs has, while he only snapped at Ensley.

It was irritating as fuck and I kept on screaming at them from my end of the tv...I must have been like 19 or 20 when that one aired.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I’m 26, diagnosed at 22. It had occurred to me for awhile before getting tested that I might have ADHD. Being unable to focus in class, no understanding of basic study habits/techniques, rarely being able to get through assigned reading. Those things had always been an issue but I always assumed it was my fault - maybe I’m not smart enough, maybe I’m not trying hard enough. I had this idea in my head that if I was truly ADHD I would’ve been diagnosed as a kid because someone would’ve noticed which is what made me believe that my symptoms were just “me.” 

When I finally got tested and they diagnosed me everything I struggled with since I was a kid made sense. I’ve been medicated ever since but on really bad days when I can’t find anything/lose everything and can’t get my head straight and stay on task at work, it’s definitely easy to blame myself, especially now that I’m medicated. Meds aren’t a cure-all but once you get to a dose that works for you, you will notice a huge difference in how you feel when you take your meds vs. when you don’t. Some days I forget my meds or leave them at home and it honestly makes me wonder how I got through 3/4 of college undiagnosed/unmedicated. Meds have been a lifesaver. 

I was on Adderall and started at 10mg as a beginning dose and gradually moved up to 30mg, so it’s possible your dose could increase. Hang in there, you will find what works. If you just now started, it’s likely your doctor is starting you up at 10mg to increase later. My doc did this with Adderall and Vyvanse - it gives your body time to adjust and for your doctor to see what works rather than starting right off at a higher dose. Don’t be discouraged! This is not your fault, you are just now beginning your journey. You are taking all the right steps and once you get that right dose, things will feel a lot clearer. Don’t give up, communicate this to your doctor and see if you need a higher dose.",1556668831

Then after that I got a loss streak of 3/4 games or so and afterwards I only won 14 lp per game and lost 20+ per game, and the worst thing is that with every loss my wins became 1 lp less worth = +14 - loss - +13 - loss - +12.

I examined the seats: ""the right side is full... guess I'll choose the opposite side."" seeing someone next to the isle I muttered ""excuse me"" as I walked past. As I reached for a swivel chair the rotation mechanism was slightly loose rotating the whole chair about me, right as I went to sit down, I noticed on his computer somethings about Israel and Jewish support I considered ""perhaps he is from Israel?"" I briefly pondered before returning to my task. 


I returned to my task quickly getting on blackboard and thinking nothing more, but had considered another class. ""I have about an hour and 20 min till this is due,"" I opted to spend some time on another classes work, with about 30 minutes till class, I finally printed the paper waiting a couple of minutes for other people grabbing papers. Finally lifting myself off of this rotation-happy seat I caught a glimpse of a video of Jewish Porn, recently started too as the Rabbi still had clothes on.

"kpopcollections","t5_3im31","It does matter if limited copies were printed in the first place. For example, HISTORY disbanded about two years ago, but their albums never dropped in price~and probably won’t ever (unless, god forbid something unforeseen happens like a scandal). There is also a chance that former or current members of groups who are contestants on survival shows become extremely popular causing a surge in demand for their older albums. So far, NU’EST has been the only group that I can think of that has had this happen to them because of Produce 101. Their album I’m Bad had only a few thousand copies printed and I think they were available at a decent price before July 2017. It’s a rare unicorn now.",1556668833

About that lake, if you check out this map

Which is a more recent version (forgot to post it in the main post :p) you'll see that the west has many lakes including a large one. The lake in this one is simply a representation of what the cartograoher heard of this great western lake which is much bigger to tiny people to whom at this point in time crossing a lake is a big challenge. So naturally he imagined a large lake.

But whenever I see chips belted in - especially blue ones - I feel rather cheated. Those fuckers easily double the footprint, and leaving them to the magic of ""the outside"" makes me a wee bit angry. A similar story about making the supply beltage: In order to weave all the alternating things around, and especially connecting all that half-belt stuff, you're again bound to use probably ~1/10th more space for that alone.

And then you're also omitting space science, which at that level of modules/beacons is certainly on the table.

I'm actually in the process of making a 300spm *ALL* inclusive setup, with smelting and oil stuff - AND space science. (But no military bottles.) Striving for a small footprint and good UPS efficiency. Even without the train stations to supply the beast, I'm already at at *least* 12x that size, and I haven't actually done the oil bits yet. 

So, please forgive me if I'm hesitant to give this an upvote, because it's essentially hiding most of the things through ""just belt it in!""-magic.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I (a mild mannered American) recently had the opportunity to visit Tim Horton's outside of Niagara while visiting the Canadian side of the falls.  I had heard the tale of the TH on Reddit and my online Canadian friends. 

We waited in a long line around lunch time for a bacon egg and cheese sandwich, small coffee and a sugary frozen drink.  The coffee was dirty water flavored, sandwich was just ok enough to write a blah post about and the drink was nothing special.  I waited in line with a lot of people to get these below average items.  Why?  Because it is a habit and you will pass two between each gas station no matter which direction you drive.  Just like McDonald's burgers are horrible but people still buy them because they are everywhere and easy to get to.  

ps The falls were beautiful.

The exceptions are specifically legislated - private party sales only go through background checks in states that require them, and many states have mandated that. 

In states where it is not mandated, you are *still* prohibited from selling a gun to someone known to be a prohibited person, so owners will frequently require some proof to that effect, such as a concealed carry permit. Gun owners have called for, time and again, the NICS system to be opened to the public, even at a nominal fee, so that they can do their own background checks when selling their firearms. The only other exception I know of to the background check requirement are some states which allow things like a concealed carry license/permit in lieu, but to have one of those, you must *already* have passed a background check.",1556668837

"traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns","t5_2uog0","I admittedly didn't watch the video because I ain't spending 20 minutes on that right now, but I think I have an idea of what it's about.

While it's true that we already produce a huge surplus of food, that alone isn't really the whole picture. Transportation already makes up a huuuuge portion of fossil fuel use. Regularly transporting shipments of food to every tiny village across the world is... not really a solution, and would have catastrophic impacts. It's super important for the environment to have local options wherever possible, and many areas just aren't arable enough to support a comfortable lifestyle like we'd expect. Also water continues to be an issue in many areas in and around deserts, as even with wells they aren't sustainable due to little water underground as well (meaning the wells will dry up sooner rather than later).

This has nothing to do with Thanos (if you have a freakin' infinity gauntlet, I'm sure you can come up with more creative solutions than just: ""kill half of people"" or ""double all resources""), but just a comment on the general arguments I see saying we already can feasibly solve the problem.",1556668838

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","The savings may not be worth the cost of a Tesla (new or used). Let’s say you keep a 100% of your gas savings (which is unlikely; Tesla’s are not maintenance free) that’s still only $3600/year. A Tesla will be around $40k. So unless you’re in need of a new car you’d be paying to upgrade. 

That being said.. I have a Model 3 and I love it! I just don’t think it makes financial sense in most cases. It will make your commute so much more tolerable though! Traffic is no longer a concern once you have a Tesla. Now when I sit in traffic I laugh at how I used to hate sitting in traffic. 

And if you do decide to get a Tesla I 100% recommend a new model 3 over any used model S. If you’re going to spend the money I suggest you get the latest tech and software that makes the new Model 3 &gt; used Model S.

&gt; WASHINGTON- Glaciers are set to disappear completely from almost half of World Heritage sites if business-as-usual emissions continue, according to the first-ever global study of World Heritage glaciers.

&gt; The authors predict glacier extinction by 2100 under a high emission scenario in 21 of the 46 natural World Heritage sites where glaciers are currently found.

&gt; The authors of the study also developed the first ever inventory of glaciers on the UNESCO World Heritage list, documenting about 19,000 glaciers present in 46 out of the 247 natural World Heritage sites.

"greysanatomy","t5_2t2vo","This is one of the biggest challenges that Grey's Anatomy currently faces and a big part of the reason why it is a shadow of its former self. This show made a name for itself with big shocking moments like Addison showing up at the end of season 1 and George writing 0-0-7 in Meredith's hand, and sexy workplace hookups. 15 years ago, it did both of those things better than any other show on tv ever had.

But being an 8pm show on ABC, it just can't compete with what's popular in television now, which is primarily on streaming platforms and premium cable channels like HBO. They can't swear, they can't show any nudity, they can't even really deal with adult themes in depth. The recent sexual assault episode is a perfect example. If it had actually been a realistic depiction of what a woman goes through when she reports a rape and gets a rape kit, it would have been way more impactful because it would have been raw and ugly and real. But they can't show that, so instead they have to rely on surgeons choking out these ridiculously forced lines while fighting back tears, and swelling music while they set up some insanely unrealistic display of women lining the halls. 

When you can't provoke feelings in your viewers by being real, you just manipulate the fuck out of their emotions. It's cheap and forced, but it works when you've built up 15 years of goodwill with a sizable audience of women in their 30s and 40s who are sticking it out to the end.

But the contrast between really good tv that doesn't have a bunch of network constraints and current-day Grey's Anatomy is stark and it has left this show in a very difficult position. They're just doing what they can with what they have at this point.",1556668841

Try to focus on the road. When I first started driving, I had to turn off the radio, put my phone on silent, and just focus on the road. A car is very responsive and you'll be able to get a feel for how to maneuver it as you get more experience.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm venting more so than anything else on an account I haven't used since like 2016/7 - I'm a fifteen year old gay guy, in my last year of compulsory education in high school (UK) for a bit of context and it's been about half a year since this happened but I haven't been able to process it all that well. 

To put it shortly, I was in an abusive relationship for almost a year and (upon breakup) my now ex pretended to kill themself three times in the span of 12 hours. I remember mourning them so vividly, screaming about how i had killed them to a friend who later suggested that I talk again to them because we were both just kids despite being aware of what they had put me through even prior to the event. Every time they returned again, I felt betrayed and conflicted because on one hand I was so, so happy they were alive but on the other I couldn't breathe knowing they had used the thing they had done to get together with me (I had to ""confess"" I loved them to stop them from killing themselves on a call one night because I was dating someone that wasn't them who I ended up dumping after we drifted apart - I really hope they're doing better these days) to hurt me so much. 

I've been to therapy, it's not the best but it's helping. Talking about it has helped a lot but there's really not much you can do when you're so young I guess. I'm still trying to come to terms with the whole ordeal as the (almost) year of emotional manipulation and abuse is something I am still feeling the repercussions of. 

Despite that I'm here, I've tried to take my life about 12 times in the past year (majority being post break up) but never gone through fully at the thought of the wonderful friends I've made after regaining my autonomy I'd lost due to ex's controlling nature - a specific one being someone I regard as a sister at this point.

However both the technos and traditions wish to enlighten the only problem with the technos is they want everyone to see it in a very narrow way whereas the traditions appreciate diversity and freedom of thought. They also acknowledge the traditions mistakes in the past and present and why the technocracy continues to win. It looks bleak but there is some hope.

"FloatTank","t5_2w32t","Hi

&amp;#x200B;

I have had a extremely stressful life for the last 6 years. Working 10-18 hour days everyday. I had my own business. I also have depression and anxiety. I am a very happy Zenfloat tank owner. I had never floated before i ordered my tank last year. I have never been able to float in any water i have bathed in. I had just heard Joe Rogan talking about it and had been searching the net for a tank I could afford. Then Duncan Trussel said he had bought a Zenfloat tent.I checked the site out and I bought it online after the Kickastarter was over.  I ordered the tank in mid November last year. Got delivery on the first of february.  It was about a month later than promised when I bought it.  Information was ok during the delivery process.

Installation was quite easy. The manual is not very good, but if you watch a video or two on their Facebook page or youtube channel it is very easy to set up. Inflate the bottom. Test the heat pads. Place them on the bottom piece. Right side up!!! It is nicely marked on the pads. Lay the tent on top and start filling on of the large side walls. Then just continue around until done. I think it was 6 panels. 2 big ones and the rest are quite small. Took about 20-30 min to set up. Lots of pumping.  The rest of the components took another half hour to set up. Pump, UV light and some pipes and cabeling. Then I left the thing sit for a week to be sure nothing leaked air. My tank was perfect. It has a few minor of the scratches almost everyone has, but on mine they are barely visible. Most people still freak out first time they see the tank. :-)  Great conversation piece. The tank is very sturdy for an inflatable item. The dropstitch technology is clever.

Then the filling of the tank. They supply a coal filter which you chould use to avoid contaminents in the water. They can cause miscolouring of the water. Remember to dump the first 15-30 litres of water to get the excess coal out of the coal filter and not in your tank. You will see when the water goes clear. With all the salt it is quite expensive to change the water, so it is smart to treat it with care.  The tank takes around 700 litres of water and 383kg of Epsom salt. This is the hard work part of the setup. It was a cold job with the Norwegian water at around 4-5 degrees celsius in winter. I used a zero MM pump to dissolve the salt quicker. It took about 2 hours of ice chilling work to get all the salt dissolved. When 100% sure there is no salt in the corners it is time to start the pump and heaters. Remember to use a residual-current device for extra protection against electric shock. The water in the tank is an excellent conductor of current. It is also very important to install the ground probe for the heaterpads. There is a risk for some electrical phenomen that you will avoid installing the probe. Just do not touch it while floating. I havent tried but I have heard it is like touching a  strong electric fence.  It took about 24 hours to get the water heated to 34 degrees celsius. Then it was time for a little adjusting of PH and alkalinity. For my water it was a matter of a little bit PH Down and a couple of tablespoons of baking soda (NOT baking powder). Then I used around 1,5 litre of 12% hydrogen peroxide to get the last parametre correct before floating. It is not possible to get 30% in Norway anymore because of a horrible terror attack a few years ago. I let the thing sit for 24 hours and checked the Levels again to be sure everything was correct.

Finally ready to float for my first time. I always shower without soap and shampoo before floating. This is to keep as much hair and oil as possible out of the water in the tank. I also always use waterproof earplugs. Both for sound and to keep water out of my ears.  Before laying down in the tank it is very important to wipe the inside down with a cloth. This is to avoid irritating drips under floats. Then I keep a dry cloth and a spraybottle with clean water in or right ouside the tank in case I should get water im my eyes. It hurts quite bad if the salt water gets in the eyes. You will also be aware of any cuts on your skin. Vaseline is your friend if you are scratched and want to float.

Ok. Everything is ready and i enter the tank and sit down. The water is so boyant that it is easy to fall backwards when trying so sit down. Not a big deal and you quickly get used to it. I close the door and lay down. It is a very wierd feeling, but at the same time extreemely comfortable. It takes some time for the waves to stop and find the center position. Touching the walls kills the sensation immidiately. It takes a few min for me to completely trust the airflow in the tank. It felt a bit claustrophobic for a few mins. But when I moved my head under the bottom airvent I coud feel the slight cold breeze comming in. When I was pretty confident I was not about to die and when I finally found my spot in the middle of the tank it was awesome. Just beeing there. Not beeing able to feel where my body starts and stops. Just floating. No difference if i keep my eyes open or closed. I can hear my heartbeats and my breath going through my body. Sometimes i get the feeling of falling forever. First time it was so long and real I had to sit up and let my behind touch the floor to be sure where I was. Sometimes just floating around in nothing. It is just so relaxing for the whole body and mind. There is the odd bubble comming up from the floor, but you get kind of used to them. They are a bit annoying though.  First float was as I had expected. Good, but I was too aware of the Whole floating experieence. Still 2 hours in the tank felt like 30min.

Second float was much better since I knew much more of what to expect. It took me a few minutes of consentrating on my breath and then I was more relaxed than I have ever been in my life. It is the feeling of total relaxness. So quiet. So comfortable. As soon as the air in the tank heats up after the door has been open. you can not feel what of the body is in or out of the water. To be honest I can not tell if i was asleep or awake for much of the time. I think I was awake.  This time i floated for 2,5 hours. Still felt like 30-45 mins. I feel so happy after the float. It lasts for hours after. Just happiness and wellbeeing.

I should have had this tank years ago. I would have had a different life today. Now I float whenever i want to. Shortest time in the tank is 45 minutes, longest 5,5 hours… I float from 1 to 6 times a week. I have floated 3 times on the same day.  Sometimes time just flies by and it is like sleeping. Sometimes i can think clearly about stuff that need to be done. Sometimes I get colour visions that doesn't change if I open or close my eyes. All the time I get total relaxation of all my body. My back and spine is much better. After a hard workout it is perfect to lay in the tank for an hour or two. If my muscles are soar it is even better.

This thing is changing my life to the better. I am a much calmer person than I was a year ago. I am not stressed anymore. I am much more positive than I have been for years. My skin has not been so smooth since I was a baby.

It is not cheap, but compared to other options it is a very good deal if you want to be able to float in Your own tank whenever you want. I have almost 50 floats now on 2,5 months. Almost 100hours. Total cost With salt and all Chemicals, transport and customs and other remedies has been around 50 000NOK for me. Approx 5800$  Salt was quite hard to get and quite expensive here. I had to order from Sweeden to get the food grade I wanted. I could get the industrial grade at an agricultural store, but I am not sure about using that. More chance for other minerals and Heavy metals, but it is mined at the same mines. Just tested much less. I will check some more on this before I change my water at some point. My goal is to keep the water for 1,5 to 2 years With proper care. The most annoying thing With the watercare is the quick depletion of Hydrogen peroxide. It is expensive and the New recomended watercare guide states 225ml 27% after each float.  That means a gallon goes fast, and the stuff is not cheap. I am the only user of my tank and I shock treat the tank with 0,5-0,75 litre H2O2 once a week, but use the UV light around 8 hours after each float. If I float many times one week I might put in 0,5 litre H2O2 midweek just to be sure.

I have not measured Power consumption yet, but I will do when I find my measuring plug.

All in all I am very happy with my tank and I will float many more times. Zenfloat Customer service has been very good. This got to be a very long post and I could write much more. I am hooked on floating.  I recomend everyone to at least try it at least 3 times if they have the chance. 3 times to be sure to get over the veird sensations the first times.",1556668845

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Everything that’s sold as “Fulfilled by Amazon” (FBA, a third party seller that ships with prime) is lumped together by UPC in an Amazon warehouse.

So if you’re selling a sunscreen on Amazon and want to use FBA, you ship all of your stock to them. It then gets tossed in the box of “identical” items and when someone orders from any FBA seller (including you) they pull out of that box and ship it.

The issue with that process is that someone else may decide to sell the same item, but ship fakes instead. Since your stock is mixed up with theirs, your customer may get the exact item you shipped in, the correct item from someone else, or a completely fake product. It’s all completely random.

I’m not sure how likely it is that people are making counterfeit sunscreens, but any popular and not dirt cheap item could be suspect. The only way you’re actually buying from a specific seller is if it’s NOT FBA. But then shipping takes a long time or costs extra.

If it is FBA, the seller doesn’t matter at all, except maybe if they’re the only seller. Even then, old stock from a previous seller could still be mixed in.

I’ve heard that this is also true of “Sold by Amazon” items, but I’m somewhat skeptical of that since it seems like a horrible business decision considering the known issue with counterfeits. But I don’t know for sure. Either way, I now only buy safety-critical items (sunscreen, supplements, etc) and counterfeit prone electronics on Amazon if Amazon or another trusted seller is the ONLY seller. Or if a trusted seller ships it themselves. Otherwise, I’ll pay more if I have to and get it at a physical store or other retailer.",1556668846

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","I understand your point, but imo there should still be a balance. Yes, certain characters should have epic moments, stepping into the fantasy-legend role. However, I don't think that should nullify the rules we've been playing with since the beginning. Fighting off dozens of wights because you're a badass swordsman? Sure! Surviving as an overweight coward who fell multiple times, has next-to-zero battle training, and whimpered while being overwhelmed? Doesn't make sense. Being completely surrounded and backed into a wall without the space to even swing your sword, and then magically being ok the next scene? Doesn't make sense. If you want these legendary characters, actually show them beating the odds rather than just baiting their deaths, cutting away, and then showing them safe.

I do want to say I enjoyed the episode for what it was, and don't want to come off as just hating on the show. Just making some points on a forum meant for discussion.",1556668846

2) **You** requested I give you the name of a black republican who could be elected by the party as president.  Now you're saying that is just tokenism.

3) **You** said the republicans would never elect a black person as president, but there only has to be one black person who could be elected as president to prove that's not true; you're now saying ""one or two isn't proof of anything.""

The truth is, the only way for me to prove that there is a black person that can be elected president by the republican party is for there to already have been a black person who has been elected president by the republican party.  Otherwise, you can always just say that person would never get elected.  Without Obama, you'd be in the exact same position with respect to the democrat party.  Obama was the most talented politician we've in decades -- had he been a republican, I think he would have been elected president as a republican.

But if you're going to just ignore my arguments and keep shifting the goal posts, there isn't really much I can offer you.",1556668846

The whole point of a special counsel is to create distance from the President and justice department influence.

But you're correct that to the extent that Rosenstein had some control over aspects of it (like his judgment with Barr after mueller submitted the report) it would be improper for Trump to discuss any of the ins and outs of that decision or influence it in any way. I don't think that is implied by Rods letter though. 

It still might have happened I don't know. I personally doubt it, but it's possible, and I'll grant that it's worth looking in to. Maybe Congress will ask him to testify about that. They will likely ask Barr those types of questions at some point.",1556668849

"Leathercraft","t5_2sufa","I’m pretty new to leather work but my experience has been that glue strength and longevity varies a lot depending on type, method, and product use. 

If the seam isn’t going to be stitched than that is gonna be a tough one if the edges are being abraded. if there’s a lot of bending and pressure, as with a shoe, that’s another factor. how much moisture or dryness the shoe will be exposed to is a huge variable also. 

I personally have found super 77 to be pretty great at adhering leather to some fabrics. but never anything with the wear of a shoe

You seem to believe you understand the interactions we have better than we do.  

It is simple to give this boilerplate advice but you do that because you're not the one getting dick pics, being asked to skip meeting for coffee and come to a stranger's house in the middle of the night, and other niceties like that.

And when it doesn't come across that way, and you try, only to learn someone is pranking you for being ugly or has an ulterior motive, your trust decreases.

My SO and I went to a metal concert last November. The show was in a poor part of the urban area. When we got out of the car, my SO and I were approached by a middle aged man. I knew he was homeless just from what he was wearing. It was the evening and lighting was bad, so I'm unsure what his ethnicity was, but he was a person of color. I couldn't quite understand most of what he said to us, but he kept asking for us not to shoot him. This was weird as fuck to me, but I assured him we meant no one any harm. He then asked us if we had any change to spare. He said, ""I'm freezin' my fuckin' ass off out 'ere. Ya got anythin' for a brutha?"" It was unbearably cold that night. I looked at my SO as I felt around to get my wallet. My SO shook their head, as they weren't carrying cash that night. I opened my wallet and it struck me how I had completely forgotten I'd had a 20 dollar bill in there for months. I quickly fumbled the 20 out and handed it to him and told him i hoped he could keep warm.

He looked at that 20 like it was the sun coming up the next morning. He said, ""Damn... God bless ya'll.""

The reason I tell this story is because, upon reflection, I wasn't as ready to give as I should have been. No, 20 bucks isn't gonna house him, or guarantee he has food for a long time, or fix the system that oppresses him. But I had metal music on my mind. Entertainment. I'm so glad he happened to be by where we parked. This experience has really opened my eyes in lots of ways. Holy fuck. I have it good. I deserve to die.",1556668851

Beatsaber is my most played VR game by a factor of four, so I'm absolutely interested in a high refresh display for any incredibly fast-paced VR games.

&gt;And Vive pro has horrible resolution 

Like I said before, these panels have 3X the pixel density of the OLED screens used in the Vive Pro. Full RGB LCD looks significantly better than pentile OLED",1556668853

well listen. you know why you did it, you told him why, and you want him to understand your reasons and forgive you. and he doesn't necessarily owe that to you, i mean feelings can still be hurt unintentionally and even though i've done this before i still can admit it's pretty selfish. so my advice is to honestly assess that, while you were telling him why he should forgive you, you were doing just as much listening to why he was mad at you in the first place. did you truly try to understand his side of things? that's up to you to answer. you need to respect this person's wishes about not wanting to be friends with you, but if you really want to work things out, let him know you genuinely do apologize and would like to make it up to him. don't speak for him (""i'm such a bad person"") and don't make excuses (""i just did it because..."")

Including, but not limited to, how the Night King was made, that his army was marching south, but admittedly no one was there to show the creation of Viserion the undead dragon. So, the theory isn't perfect. 

Also, we don't even see the NK until season 4 and that's through Bran, so there's no way that there have been ""constantly shots of the Night King or his army moving south which were not from the perspective of any of the ensemble cast since they were miles away from any of them.""

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","I hated almost everything about it as a then-hardcore fan of the franchise. Not because it's different - they're all pretty different - I legit think it's bad.

I find the plot fundamentally busted. It starts out being about what are essentially gods who can sit practically in plain sight in the only city of humanity and yet still go undiscovered for eons, who somehow get things done by enslaving people to either take on a task given only to them by the vaguest possible vision and a time limit before they're killed (btw the person is basically killed even if they succeed), offering literally no other communication to anyone. It's also full of holes and just poorly-thought out plotpoints and motivations.

I find the script full of nausea-inducing insubstantial flowery prosey schmaltzy anime bullshit on an order of magnitude way higher than is typical of preceding games. These people who are supposed to be actively on the run, so much so that the whole game is designed to be a corridor to blindly run down to sell the idea that they can't be staying still for a moment, find every opportunity to stop and yammer on about anything they can as long as it has nothing to do with the actual details of the plot or the world it takes place in - that's all up to you to read.

I really enjoyed Spoony's Youtube review of it (the version without his little skits is preferable), he points out a lot of examples of what I'm talking about.

The one thing I really appreciated about the game is that it gates your level-grinding so it never gets too easy if you're like me and have no self-control (you can gain XP all day but can't actually spend any more past a certain point until you beat the next boss).",1556668853
"3d6","t5_2wkux","Comparing Barb 5/Rogue 3 with Barb 8, we have the following damages:

Barb 5/Rogue 3 raging attacks with a rapier for 2x(1d8+5) plus 1 sneak attack of 2d6 damage. Average is 26 damage

Barb 8 attacks raging attacks with a longsword for 2x(1d8+6). Average is 21.

Barb 8 with greatsword attacks raging for 2x(2d6+6). Average is 26

So actually, given you can Sneak Attack every round (which isn't hard thanks to Reckless Attack) the Rogue MC increases average damage, unless they use a Greatsword, although you are slightly less accurate because you lack an 8th level ASI.

---

Full barb levels also gives you 1 more rage per long rest, and more hit points, but less mobility (no BNS action dash or disengage). Full barb can opt to use longsword and warhammers instead of rapiers, which gives them a wider breadth of magic weapon and damage types to deal.

Full barb also has a +7 in athletics compared to a rogue MC's +9, making it harder to grapple high STR opponents.",1556668853

"KingdomHearts","t5_2s3jo","Main gripe is people say middle of development engine switch. It was early on. From 1 year into development out of 5? 6? years total dev time, how much coding and tools would they have done already? Surely the concepts and drafting of what they're going to make comes first. 

It's also not their first time developing. Sure there are new ways to do things and learn, but the same would of happened over the years since KH first started on PS2. Evolving from platform to platform and advances in capabilities. In the interview they said they spent time doing exercises and contests making stuff even irrelevant to the game, just to flex and show they could do in UE4. Would of been helpful to see what new things they could apply to KH.

Didn't sound like they were strapped for time or playing desperate catch-up for time lost due to engine switch.

Luminous engine seems to have been new anyway. And only FF15 ended up using it. Which we know how that dev time went, massive PITA.",1556668855

"pathofexileps4","t5_qvoc2","I always wanna say using some sort of phone chat or discord would be useful, but then I think about it, and youll get too many troll replies or lowballs if we had a chat to ask in, not to mention people would 100% stop researching, and just move to asking lol.  


Keep an eye on what modifiers tend to be on items that sell (cant be avoided, 40% increased damage implicit, etc). Yellows are really hard to be like ""well its worth this"" but dont feel bad about offering something lower and SENDING A MESSAGE when you submit the bid. I have saved a lot of chaos by asking someone if he needed fuses or alchemies before dropping the chaos he asked for. Asking for prices on reddit or the forum is risky, because theres are about as many opinions as their are people  


Definitely ignore pc prices on ps4. When you go to buy something, make sure to look at all the pages of the item, there usually isnt more than 10, and if you use L3+left arrow, you can type something in to highlight an item. When looking for geoffrys sancturary, just search for sancturary. If you need to search something more specific, use something like ""1 chaos"" and youll see all the items prices at 1 chaos (or 11, 111, etc). only search by who is online, because they are all probably gonna pricecheck their item again before they hit accept.   


Often times if it isnt something i need immediately, ill do a day or two watching the price on the market. We dont have chat yet, but our market system is far superior to pc",1556668855

&gt; Noor, one of the responding officers, shot and killed her as she approached the police squad vehicle where Noor and his partner, officer Matthew Harrity, sat.

&gt; Prosecutors attacked the credibility of other officers, especially Minneapolis police Sgt. Shannon Barnette, the supervisor on the scene after officer Noor killed Ruszczyk.

&gt; According to trial witnesses and prosecutors, Barnette deactivated her body camera multiple times during the night of the shooting, jumped to conclusions about whether Noor and his partner had been startled before Noor shot, and told another officer that Ruszczyk was &amp;quot;Probably a drunk or a drug addict&amp;quot; after she was killed.

*****
&gt; Noor, one of the responding officers, shot and killed her as she approached the police squad vehicle where Noor and his partner, officer Matthew Harrity, sat.

&gt; Prosecutors attacked the credibility of other officers, especially Minneapolis police Sgt. Shannon Barnette, the supervisor on the scene after officer Noor killed Ruszczyk.

&gt; According to trial witnesses and prosecutors, Barnette deactivated her body camera multiple times during the night of the shooting, jumped to conclusions about whether Noor and his partner had been startled before Noor shot, and told another officer that Ruszczyk was &amp;quot;Probably a drunk or a drug addict&amp;quot; after she was killed.

"GearsOfWar","t5_2ruzg","Weapon tuning did the last update months ago.

The bottom line is: there are still 2 weapon tuning system. 

One for Core and one for competitive.

The differences are:
- Gnasher in competitive has a sharp fall off of dmg after 3 player unit distance. 
- in competitive a gnasher is used for close quarter combat mostly. Since it loses that effectiveness. But is still a weapon of choice. 


- The Lancer with active reload takes 11 bullets in Core tuning...to take a player down in competitive takes couple more bullets to do the same task. This means you require good reflex in order to avoid getting downed if caught off guard. 

The other weapons from my understanding And knowledge playing feels the same in both tunings.",1556668859

 An outboard is an engine on a boat that is self contained and sits on the back, its half above and half below water. 

An I/O motor is an inboard outboard engine. They are common in bigger boats like the one pictured. Basically take a big car or truck engine (can be diesel or gas) and put it inside the boat then you run a shaft out of the boat to an outdrive (the part on the back of the boat that has the propeller etc. Very similar to the lower below water half of an outboard engine). 

A trolling motor is a small outboard engine used in addition to the standard engine (electric or gas powered) usually used to move slowly and quietly when fishing where sound matters and slow moving is the usual.

They made a really big version of something that was already commonplace. Even if you count that as genuine technological progress, one breakthrough in hundreds of years is some epic stagnation.

&gt;So is the Foundation Trilogy *also* not science fiction?

Maybe if that were the only criterion. It's been so long I don't really remember, except that Seldon makes a pretty epic scientific breakthrough in the first book.

They sure as hell can run labs and do vitals in psych so get these people out of my ICU.  I had a patient try to hang her self with a sat probe wire.  She had wrapped it around her neck several times and made enough of a ligature that I seriously considered trying to cut it off (a bit purple, but no harm since I caught it quickly).  I was mildly pissed because she was complaining about being bored there and I had lent her my New Yorker magazine (she taught high school English); we had a bit of rapport, so it felt a bit like a personal betrayal!  Honestly though, I hope she made out ok, I got security to come in and watch her (the poor girl was calm but severely depressed and I didn't want to 4-point her) and shipped her out within an hour.

Life is hard to navigate alone and I didn’t realize it at the time but she always asked me to keep it on the down low. I realize now that she said that (maybe not with the intention of but) because she knew she was doing something “wrong”. And I did which only hurt me more and now if i talk about the situation with anyone I consider a friend they either are opposed to believing open relationships or telling me “you should have known better.” Arguably she was just doing her best as was I but I don’t think anyone’s best was “right” here. I should have listened to myself every time she made me question me and looked out for myself while I was trying to take care of everyone. No one’s lookin out for me, and if you close this off to the three in the scenario, i was the only one not getting looked after. Anyway, thank you for listening and apologies for venting.

AOC made some other good comments about pelosi in that article which explain policy positions.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-congress-interview-797214/

&gt; One thing that is notable about the speaker [Pelosi] is that she does believe that the Democratic Party should be a progressive party. She is in the difficult position of having to juggle all of these different wings within the party, but her personal politics are very progressive. I have not found an issue where we are really opposed...

&gt; I don’t want to compromise where we’re going, but I’m willing to compromise on how we get there. I believe in single-payer health care, so that every American is covered with physical, mental and dental health care that is free of cost. That’s my vision. If I lobby the caucus enough so that our most conservative members fight for a public option, that’s a huge win...

I'd encourage you to consider the hypothesis that it not's ""centrist"" dems that suck so much, it's really the people they represent. (Due largely to the authoritarian propaganda machine).

A good piece of evidence that this is real, and not made up by neo-liberals to stop progressive legislation, is to study US populations and their representatives. 

There's no ""AOC of Alabama"", even though I guarantee there are people living in Alabama who could be their AOC.

The best progressives in congress right now all represent high left populations. And when you start talking about statewide and national representative strategy, it's really important to accept the reality of those populations, keeping the house requires not getting the constituents of those people pissed off, and just trying to not give a supermajority to the GOP in the senate requires the same.

Certainly Clinton/Kaine suffered from a less clear definition of what they stood for compared to their competition (as ugly as what Trump stood for was, it was at least crystal clear).

&amp;#x200B;

I really wonder if picking a VP that is ideologically similar, that can passionately articulate what their administration will represent, would be a better strategy than trying to spread the ticket's appeal with some other swing state Senator/Governor with a different ideology. A Warren/Sanders ticket would have an incredibly strong brand among Democrats and progressives.

"ProRevenge","t5_2vjvl","COPY POSTED ONLY BECAUSE POST GETS REMOVED BY MOD
===========
So it's a long story, TL:DR at the end. I've been thinking for a few weeks posting here after a friend told me about this Forum. First time post so I am not sure if it is really ProRevenge and my english is not the best so bear with me.

First of all, a long backstory about me, my asshole of an Ex-Husband and my Boss.

I was in an abusive relationship for over 6 years, my ex is a poor excuse of a human being and I’ve learned to hate him more than anything else. I’m mad of myself till this day because it took me way too long to get out of this situation. It was not until I got pregnant that I had enough strength to escape everything, so my child has a safe home. I planned everything in secret and left without a word, I moved as far away as I could go, I deleted all my social media accounts, got a new phone number and used my maiden name again.

​

With the money I saved I bought a train ticket and I’ve ended up in a small and extremely friendly village. To be honest, it was just a mistake that I’ve stranded there but it was the best that could ever happen to me. I was desperate to get a job but I dropped out of school and ran away with my ex when I was 16 (I know it was stupid...), I had no graduation, no driver’s license and I never worked before but I was too scared to go to the social security office because I thought they might be giving out my new name and address to my ex (Later I’ve learned about women's shelter and data protection but yeah... I was pretty dumb back then).

​

It just happened that I applied to a small Hotel in the village, the owners, my boss and her husband are just amazing. If they ever need it, I would give my kidney to them. I just love them; my boss is the kindest and understanding person I’ve ever met.

​

But back to the story, I just applied to be a dishwasher, my boss told me they don't need more kitchen personnel. I don't know what happened to me at this moment, but I just broke down in tears and cried and cried. I thought she would be mad or something because it's not very professional, but she just stood up without a word went outside and when she came back a few minutes later she had tea and snacks with her. She sat down and handed me the tea and calmly asked me if I want to talk about it. I don't know why but I just talked and talked and talked over an hour, I told her everything. She said nothing and just listened the whole time, it felt amazing to just let everything out. When I finished, she said the most awesome words I’ve ever heard: ""Well, we don't need more kitchen personnel, but you can come in tomorrow and work two weeks with my husband at the front desk. If you prove yourself, you could start there."" I never thought it was possible but she explained to me that Hotelier is not a registered job title so everybody can open and/or work in a hotel.

​

To make the story not longer than it already is, my first day there was now over 8 years ago. I worked my ass off to repay her kindness no and it was more than worth it. My Boss helped me through all this time, she allowed me to bring my child in when I had problems finding a babysitter and payed me well even though I had no experience. She gave me days off so I can go to school and I got my graduation after 2 years in evening school, after 5 years of work there I got the admission to the final exam without vocational training, my boss promoted me to front desk manager 2 years ago and I got a pretty nice 45k salary. It's enough for me and my daughter to go on vacation twice a year and life a great life.

Things were awesome, I never felt better in life until my Ex Husband showed up one day at work... He found out where I went because my mother’s friend told him by accident... Great. Now he was there AT MY WORK telling me how he missed me and how he is sorry for everything that happened, and he wants to be a family again. I kicked him out. A few days gone by and the police where at my door. My Ex-husband called the police because of child abduction. It was complicated because of my youth I’ve never thought about that when I made my plans, but he was THEORETICALLY in the rights to do so, he was the father after all, and I left with the child. But I had one point on my side he never signed custody, so I had sole custody and therefore it was no abduction. Things where settled with the police and I was allowed to go home. I told my boss everything and I saw in her head formed a plan.

​

She asked me if I had ever taken photos of the abuse and luckily, I did. I documented everything every single bruise and blackeye I had medical recordings for broken bones because he hit me with a chair until it broke and a lot more. Another few days later my boss got a call from my ex-husband asking for my number. She was more than happy to tell him he has to call back later because she is in a meeting (Lie). She told me and we agreed to give him my work-cellphone number. It doesn’t even take him 10 minutes after he had the number to blow my phone up with messages and calls. First, he was ""nice"" talking about how he missed me all those years but after a few messages it was clear he was after the money I make. Bitching about how I have such a good life now and left him all alone. Buh huh.... He never worked a day in his life and just used and abused the system to pay for his alcohol and glue addiction. (I shit you not. He spends over 500€ a month just on glue to sniff it...)

He cussed at me called me a whore and even threatened to do harm to me and my child when I refused to take him back.

With all these things in hand my boss went to her longtime lawyer and asked him for advice. In the meantime, my Ex-husband wanted to be settled in our Hotel. For free ofc, because ""I’m family after all"". When I saw his name in the guestlist I was mad. I wanted to kick him out, but my boss told me not to. We have security cameras everywhere and my boss wanted to make sure he is seen on it. I worked the front desk when he checked in and I told him with a smile on my face to kindly fuck of and leave me alone. He always had a short fuse and hated when I talked back so he was pissed and cussed at me, still my smile on my face I just told him we are never going to be a family and he is the worst person I’ve ever met, when he saw that I don't fear him anymore he just hit me over the counter.

​

I pressed my panic button and screamed, two of our cooks tackled him until the police arrived. They asked me if I wanted to press charges and I ofc said yes. My Boss handed out complaint forms to all guest in the Hotel, present or not in the incident and asked them kindly to please note that they were disturbed trough the commotion and they get 15% of their room prices. Funny thing, nearly all guest handed them back and got their 15% off. So, as I said the Hotel lawyer looked into everything and he managed to sue him. Twice. Once on behalf of the hotel and the second for myself.

​

We had so much evidence that he had to pay for all the money the hotel lost for hitting me in the face with cost of the lawyer (2,5k) and he was not allowed near the hotel anymore. For my trial the judge said normally claims for damages lapse after three years (Broken bones etc.) but he took my particular situation into consideration and I got 25k for damages to my body as well as emotional damage and a restraining order.

The best part is: This whole trial made the tax office and the social services looking into it and were more concerned with him, all funds he has evaded were charged him what was about 23k. He got 3 years on probation and 500 hours of community service.

​

Honestly the money was not important for me and even though he got what he deserved (in my opinion) I’m proud to get back on him and at the same time I’m still a bit sad. I blame a lot on me because if I had made things different when I was younger, I might never end up in this situation but I’m glad everything turned out well.

​

TL: DR: Ex-Husband tracks me down 8 years after I left him and got my life right and wants my money. Calls the Cops on me and hits me in the Face on cam. He got charged over 50k to repay several people, 500 hours community service and got a restraining order.",1556668866

Both. Riot makes more than enough skins per year to throw a bone to a couple forgotten champions and it's not like they are struggling with profits.

Plus, not everything is about immediate profit. Player satisfaction is a big part of a game's success.

But personally, I actually used almost entirely Axe on my first character and then 2nd character was entirely Odachi since I really enjoyed the playstyle and versatility of the weapon (with a 2nd odachi sub for a particular set bonus and some skills)

Climbing up to endgame though, getting a feel for all weapons was fun. If you found two weapons equally fun, it's nice to be able to use both. I would see the primary weakness of Odachi as being speed and you could easily equip a single katana for parry skills against human enemies if you wanted.

Market conditions were working against Spotify:
* Slower internet connections and lower data caps.
* WiFi was still pretty lame and had difficulty with streaming for a long time. It’s why Sonos had to develop its own proprietary wifi.
* Smartphone adoption was still to peak for many years.
* Proliferation and adoption of music streaming devices such as Sonos, Chromecast and other handoff modes.
* Most cars on the road didn’t have Bluetooth or even auxiliary for many years.
* Plenty of musicians waited to put their catalogues on streaming services believing it to be a fad.

Spotify had to wait for those market conditions to change in order for music streaming to become a viable alternative for most consumers. Apple entered when the market was ripe. Do I believe Apple would have been further ahead than Spotify was? Absolutely but they wouldn’t have the number of subscribers they have today.

When Apple Music launched, Spotify had 24 million paid subscribers. Where Apple Music has amassed 50 million subscribers since its launch, Spotify has gained more than 75 million paid subscribers. Far more than Apple! Why has Spotify managed to gain over 75 million subscribers in less than four years when it took them 7 years to gain the initial 24 million?

"StarVStheForcesofEvil","t5_32uti","&gt; He refused to be involved in the important part - the political part. That was the part he wouldn't get involved in.


&gt; He did give a speech at the end...only to then try and reaffirm he was better then Marco with that making his speech feel fake.


&gt; But, again, the political reasons did not matter to him and show no signs of it mattering.


&gt; Star's benchmark is Marco, this is true, but Marco's ability is not hard to replicate.


So basically be more like Marco but not copy Marco, and believe in Star's ideology (politics) which Tom might not be interested in, but needs to be a true believer otherwise any involvement doesn't count.

&gt; Not spend the party trying to get the hostess to just go have fun and let everything be for better or worse because he wants kissy time.

So Tom's not helping pushing the ideological agenda, he's too busy trying to enjoy the party and to get the host to enjoy the party too, which undermines the agenda.

I'm getting a real sense here that an argument could be made that Tom's not being supportive of Star, but because he has no interest in her ideology. And when he does go through the motions of trying to do it, it doesn't count because he has to really believe it and not just go through the motions or trying to emulate Marco.

&gt; Star already did that - she supported his endeavors, listened to his problems, and even tried to find time for him in her busy schedule. The only thing Star failed at was talking about the kiss. Period.

Honestly I don't see Star doing much to be supportive of Tom in the same way he's being accused of. What ideology does Tom expect Star to get behind? None, so pretty easy for Star. In fact the benchmark of what Tom wants from Star for him to be satisfy is ridiculously low, I would say into the negatives (below the reasonable standards) as he's being a doormat from how he used to be and is okay with stuff like the Marco kiss way too well.

This goes back to the fundamental problem of Star having full control and Tom having no agency to affect things, Star has full dominance over him in the relationship. And this was a doing of hers, she initiated his anger management to change him, which he later decided he wanted also. This turned him into a huge doormat, and the only time I can think of Star being supportive of Tom was the anger management thing. I'm not sure if that's a positive thing though as it's originally something Star wanted (changing people is not necessarily a good thing, especially in relationships), and we can see the negative impacts of it now.

&gt; Just because it's bad to change your mind at the last moment doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

Again, when commitments are made, after a certain point it's unduly negligent and extremely irresponsible to back out, and people are to be held accountable for such. I mean you wouldn't back out of commitments with your friends and family and cause damage to them, or at least you'd see how that's wrong, right? If a couple got together, mortgaged a house together, had a few kids who are toddlers, it'd be extremely irresponsible and damaging if one of them just ""changed their minds"" and left. It happens, but it doesn't make the one bailing any less accountable and disreputable. 

The trip is a perfect stand in for their relationship, and I'm sure it's no mistake but intended. Tom's is willing to go on the trip and will put up with ridiculous levels of ""more people to say bye to"" as to symbolize his doormat nature, but Star has ""full control"" of refusing to go as to symbolize it's all about Star not being happy Tom isn't Marco because of the benchmark. So Star by being so irresponsible to the point of negligence to drag out delaying the trip till beyond the last possible moment, this matches what she's doing in their relationship.

I think it's pretty clear that Tom's not really doing anything wrong, he's just not what Star is interested in. It's like how Star is not interested in any of the spots in the book for the trip, hence no circling nor even trying anything. What Star is interested in is Marco, which is where she goes to right away after seemingly ""not knowing"" where she wants to be.

Regardless, like ""changing her mind"" with the trip beyond the last possible moment and being extremely irresponsible and negligent for such, with Tom and Star's relationship for Star do the same is also extremely irresponsible and negligent. Star's the only one who could have done something about it (break up earlier, talk it over with Tom, etc). Tom can't really because he's satisfied with their relationship/is willing and ready to go on the trip. So this is why everything falls on ""Star's lap as the reason for failure"". It is Star's responsibility to speak up or bail ASAP to ensure the least damage to the other party, and if ASAP is way too late she's still accountable for it.",1556668868

&gt; A number of Venezuelan troops have sought asylum in Brazil&amp;#039;s embassy in Caracas, a senior Brazilian official said Tuesday, after Venezuela&amp;#039;s self-declared president Juan Guaido claimed soldiers had joined him.

&gt; The petitions for asylum came as Bolsonaro threw his support behind Venezuelans &amp;quot;Enslaved by a dictator,&amp;quot; a reference to President Nicolas Maduro whom Guaido is challenging for power.

&gt; &amp;quot;Brazil is on the side of the people of Venezuela, President Juan Guaido and the freedom of Venezuelans,&amp;quot; Bolsonaro said in a series of tweets.

Hell they show concern for Donut multipe times when they think he is captured or injured but Doc on the otherhand is hated by both sides and they even wanted him to die in the chorus trilogy multiple times so really Doc fits here more

Locus is the perfect fit for red team because red team has needed a straight man to their silly antics for as long as forever and now would be the perfect chance to have him be a part of it as he has an alien ship they could tie to the cosmic powers, he has already worked with Grif who trused Locus( and still has his volleyballs in his ship im sure), and this arc has primarily been red team arc as their members have gotten the most development so adding someone to their roster would be perfect.

Then they moved out and put the house up for sale. The missing section of fence caused their property value to go down about $10k ($170k house). They were back, talking about getting that fence put back up. So I agreed. Drew up an agreement, got a notary and sat down with them to sign. They refused. Said it was my responsibility. And that is when I informed them that the fence was sitting on their property and technically, they were fully responsible for the cost. I had offered to cover half the cost to be a good neighbor. 

So we both walked away from that meeting. And their house sat empty on the market for the next 3 years. They eventually sold the house for $120k.

Everybody works, and they do shows back to back. Who in their fucking right mind would tell someone, after they've just worked a match, ""Um, hey, you have to haul all this luggage.""

I feel I know plenty about guns and I think most people who don’t have regular encounters with people who hunt and etc. are more afraid of them than me. I think everyone needs to chill out when it comes to the gun issue and compromise is the best solution. I don’t believe people need full auto shotguns, but I don’t like when target shooters have strict limits on ammunition they can buy; it’s an inconvenience and I understand how they can be feeling the government is placing excessive restrictions on their way of life.

He’s not a top flight starting caliber safety, so his market couldn’t have been that competitive. The other flaw in your theory is they will not have had any time to evaluate Sendejo against Sullivan or any other UDFAs or this new kid we nicked from San Fran before May 7th. I really don’t see them releasing Sendejo before May 7th after the shitshow we had in our defensive backfield with all the injuries that piled up last season.

"brasilivre","t5_351wl","&gt; o piti que você está dando

Não dei ""piti"" nenhum. Vc deve ser muito sensível.

&gt; Se dicionários, livros que definem palavras, não servem de argumento para você, então você está fazendo revisionismo. Se você inventa suas definições eu não tenho como discutir, pois não sei quais são suas definições pessoais.

Não serve de argumento porque não explica como chegou àquela conclusão. Você, por exemplo, escreveu um monte de lorota sobre ""socialismo"", mas o Michaelis diz que é ""toda doutrina que prega um sistema econômico e político que se fundamenta na socialização dos sistemas de produção e no controle estatal dos setores econômicos."" Ou seja, tudo o que vc disse é invencione e bate de frente com o dicionário.

E quando um autor diz uma coisa, e outro diz outra coisa? Vc confia em qual? É o mesmo caso que debatemos.

&gt; Hitler dizia ser de direita

Ele se dizia socialista -- como ele era --, anti-capitalista, anti-burguesia e anti-marxismo, assim como Anton Drexler e Goebbels.

O Programa do Partido Nazista (que vc mesmo pode buscar e ler) pregava que o Estado deveria sustentar a população; que todo mundo deveria trabalhar não para sustento e benefício próprio, mas para o bem-estar de todos (coletivismo puro); que qualquer renda de herança (ou semelhantes), especulação e afins fosse abolida; a nacionalização de empresas à força; a divisão do lucro de ""grandes empresas"" com o povo; expansão em larga escala da Previdência alemã; reforma agrária que proibisse a especulação.

Ele é tudo o que vc chamou de ""esquerda"".

&gt; O racismo e o fascismo são características da extrema-direita porque são pontos de vista conservadores levados ao extremo.

A União Soviética era racista com judeus, poloneses e ucranianos, e levada ao extremo. Che Guevara dizia que ""negros têm pouco apego ao banho"" e que eram ""indolentes"". Fidel Castro mandava gays para campos de concentração.

Seu argumento (""são características da extrema-direita"") é ruim -- a não ser que vc considere todos estes como ""extrema-direita"".

&gt; o conservadorismo é a manutenção dessas tradições e é parte do que caracteriza os movimentos de direita

Che Guevara era conservador. Fidel Castro era conservador. A URSS era conservadora. Vc viu meus argumentos ali em cima.

&gt; A URSS não era de esquerda: ela era de extrema-esquerda

Extrema-esquerda não faz parte da esquerda? Extrema-esquerda é direita agora?

&gt; Não é de se espantar que você considere qualquer ditadura ou intervenção estatal como ""esquerda""

Eu nunca disse isso.

&gt; Hitler se declarava abertamente de direita

Em que fonte? Qual a página do ""Mein Kampf""?

&gt; é esquecer que no passado o preconceito e a discriminação contra gays, negros e judeus era normal.

Vc acabou de associar ""racismo"" à direita, dizendo que ""o racismo e o fascismo são características da extrema-direita"". Che Guevara era de ""extrema-direita""?",1556668875

"islam","t5_2qhbp","From what I have heard, and correct me if I am wrong, there is no substantial evidence against NAK, and he even comes out and clarifies on his facebook page what had happened from his perspective. 

As Muslims, if there is not enough evidence and if he himself say it didn't happen and instead says its a misunderstanding, then we should believe him and put it in the past. We should follow the Sharia.

To be fair I haven't looked into it extensively though, has any other evidence come up regarding his case?

On another point, he has some of the best videos for arabically illiterate Muslims on youtube regarding the nature of the linguistic Quran. I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the man whom Allah blessed to be able to convey and his miracles in such a manner.



Edit: Woah woah woah, hold up. I just spend the last half an hour looking into what I ignored about NAK in the past.
&gt;  Credibly alleged to be a sexual predator 

This is false.

Even the people accusing him admitted that there was no assault or unwillingness on either parties part to start talks in hopes of marriage. Even the screenshots of conversations and the pictures of himself he sent. He showed a picture of where he was injured in one, and the others were revealing- I'll grant you that- but even then they were barely revealing. He didnt do some flex in front of the mirror with his phone up- it was just a picture of his smiling face.

He is NOT credibly alleged to be a sexual predator, if anything he exceeded the proper bounds with the niyah of marriage. 

Sure he definitely made a mistake, yeah he admitted he was wrong, he's still a human being. Also if you take into account his 2 decades of work, why does being human and making a bad mistake suddenly make him an unreliable source. Every single scholar we watch or listen to makes mistakes, some of them worse than NAK. Do we know about those? No.

NAK aint a kuffar, he's just someone who's mistakes were exposed and exaggerated by other people.

There shouldn't be a reason to stop learning from him.",1556668875

QE = Fed expands the level of reserves thru asset purchases

Fed repo facility = banks swap Treasuries for reserves on demand

Biggest difference is QE is aimed to reduce long-term interest rates. The increase in reserves is an unwanted byproduct.

The repo facility is to encourage banks to hold more Treasuries instead of reserves for regulatory purposes, so the Fed can shrink its balance sheet more now and has greater ability to expand it if needed in the future. 

This program will end up costing money because the US Treasury has to pay banks more interests via securities than implicitly thru the Fed via interest on excess reserves. In return the Fed gains the ability to increase balance sheet more in a future downturn. It’s a very nice way of buying insurance today for a bigger payoff in an eventual recession.",1556668876

From experience, I know 4 CFM (my Houdini) is less than ideal for hiking. Granted, it’s not bad, I’m in no rush to replace. I just find myself fanning out more often than I’d like, so I want something more breathable than what I have.

From theory, 35 CFM is the other side of the spectrum. First, it’s hard to even find shirts in this range. Second, Richard Nisley over on BPL has publish tons of data that suggests 35 CFM is ideal for aerobic activity (7 MET). 

Anecdotally, the industry seems to be converging on 10 CFM. From the EE 10D to the Tachyon to the Squamish, there are many offerings in this range (probably for good reason).

Since I know I want more than 4 CFM, I don’t think my logical next purchase should be the other side of the spectrum. Rather, I’ll take one step in the right direction, see how well that works out for me before going to the next level.

My grandmother had dementia. And my siblings as well as my parents were always around her and my grandfather to take care of them. We went away for a three week vacation and my dads sisters came around to watch my grandparents and take care of them. When we got back my grandmother's entire demeanor had changed. She went from loving us, talking to us daily and having full trust to out right hating us. She screamed at my older brother and our mother to get out of her house and never set foot in it again. We were accused of beating, stealing, coercing, and other crimes against my grandparents.  
My father's sisters used my grandmothers dementia to warp her mind into believing we were out to get her despite being there for her and my grandfather for years prior, trying to keep them going through their rapidly decreasing health. My grandparents were fairly wealthy and we knew my aunts were trying to get their money. We went to court twice with them to defend ourselves against the accusations. My aunts never won, but I still never saw my grandparents again. The damage was done.  


My grandmother passed about two years later and my grandfather followed after another two. I will never know if my grandmother, who practically raised me and my older brother while our parents worked their butts off, died hating us, loving us, or maybe not evening remembering. And I will never know if they died alone or had someone beside them. I think of both of them often and it still haunts me.  


And in case anyone was wondering, my grandfather had suffered a massive stroke years before this all went down and as such wasn't always quite lucid, so while all this went down he didn't fully care is how I would imagine, or maybe didn't fully grasp the situation.",1556668877

I'm not even 100% convinced this is a nerf for support Tahm Kench either. Like, yes, his devour is WAYYY weaker on allies and his ult was HEAVILY nerfed at rank 1, but he also got a ridiculous buff to his Q and E.

13% range buff on his Q? Rank 1 slow of 50% for 2 fucking seconds?! That's god damn amazing.

And now you can just spam E in every trade since it's free. 

And his rank 3 ult just got a fucking 30% range buff. I bet you can ult from drake to Baron now... That's a big deal!

There's a real chance that Tahm Kench comes away from these changes stronger than before... The way I see it, his W being good is now dependent on Tahm having flash.

&gt; Some students in the library described hiding under desks or turning out lights, and others said the phoned calling family members.

&gt; Jordan Peace, 19, a freshman, told NBC News in a phone interview that she was on the library&amp;#039;s second floor working on a final project due Tuesday night around 5:40 p.m. when she saw students running upstairs.

&gt; A police officer then entered the library asking if anyone else was inside the library, and when he told those students to leave &amp;quot;And we all grabbed our stuff and ran out,&amp;quot; she said.

Could be Montreal, there's a 10 road there, bu doesn't seem French enough. Another 10 goes through New Orleans, and the surroundings look about right. Didn't realise the ""Mobile"" on the sign was a town name.!&lt;

R2: 5000. &gt;!Definitely Poland with that L. Gdynia is just north of Gdansk. Looking for the container terminal near a motorway.!&lt;

R3: 5000. &gt;!In Greece. Road sign puts me near Ionnina along the A2. Follow that to the sea and I find the other two towns on the sign. Go for the main ferry terminal.!&lt;

R4: 5000. &gt;!Israel, Port of Hadera. Service station up the road.!&lt;

R5: 5000. &gt;!French. ""Derpartement de Seine"" - so probably where the Seine meets the sea. The map looks like that area too. Somewhere on the north side, between Le Havre and Dieppe.  Dieppe looks right, has DFDS ferries and a roundabout.!&lt;",1556668880

""no! its small one!"" ends up calling her office/coworker, and she's standing by the hp ink wall trying to find it. At this point i'm highly amused. i ditch her to help customers who will actually accept my help/service. as i finish with a couple customers i overhear the coworker tell her its 202, and at this point I can't tell if she's pretending NOT to have seen it earlier to save face or if she's just DUMB, but i point her back to the toner aisle and whisper at her ""202a is right there as i showed you before..""

she ends up finally leaving with the 202a after wasting almost half an hour of her own time. i dont mind people not knowing what their cartridge is, but i get super annoyed when they ask you for help, help is given, and they need a phd dissertation to convince them to purchase.. like, you asked me muthafuka!",1556668881

It's a medieval setting too, but it's not as typical as GOT, plus Pratchett is really good at making everything hilarious.

Maybe you'd like 'Good Omens' too, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. It's about the apocalypse but it happens in our time. It's quite funny too and they're making a TV series about it right now on Amazon Prime. 

Theres also 'American Gods', by Neil Gaiman, also turned into a TV series by Amazon Prime. It adds mythology from all over the world to the actual USA, so I guess it belongs to the genre of urban fantasy.",1556668882

From my experience it looks like its encoded/streamed using variable bit rate (VBR) which will cause the blocking and artifacts people are seeing. VBR will lower the bit rate during dark scenes because it assumes that there is no detail in the scene and what we're experiencing is that the data rate dropping during dark scenes and then during scenes with more light the bit rate goes back up. That is why the well light scenes look so much better because there is literally more data being streamed during those scenes. The way to fix this is HBO needs to encode their masters with Constant Bit Rate (CBR) that way the detail will remain constant no matter what.",1556668884

"Granblue_en","t5_3e3se","The thing with tsundere is they actually need some dere moments to balance things out. Going 100% tsuntsun just makes them annoying and bitchy and people dislike that. I've noticed that (as a trope) tsundere characters need to be balanced a bit more towards the _deredere_ side than the _tsuntsun_ side or people start to dislike them (rightfully so IMO) for being annoying and bitchy.

For an example, compare Kirino (from Oreimo) with Taiga (from Toradora). Kirino has few redeeming qualities outside of being occasionally being cute. While she isn't a total bitch she's not a very likeable character (not to say she isn't a _cute character_) for most of her series. She has some dere moments but they're so outweighed by tsun moments. I know a lot of people grew to hate her, at least until near the end of the series. On the other hand, Taiga grows from a hard tsuntsun-tsundere who's hard to like into a more deredere-tsundere as the show progresses and as a result she becomes less of a total bitch and more of a relatable, likable character.

Just my $0.02 on the issue. In fact /u/TheArchest [just below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Granblue_en/comments/biydpo/primal_resonance_event_discussion/em6a82t/) seems to take issue with her being so tsuntsun. It's cute in small doses but just gets annoying with 100% tsun all the time.",1556668884

Like, when one person hits the despair event horizon, their influence within the megacorp naturally dwindles, so to effect the entire megacorps decision making is hard, unless all power is very firmly in the hands of one individual - and in the few cases like that, the individual in question may be something like a Great Dragon himself.  Here's my recommendations:

- assassination resistance - you ought to be able to tank multiple direct hits from Thor Shots or hydrogen bombs, and at least be capable of fleeing from direct simultaneous assault by multiple Great Dragon-level combatants.  And you need to be able to cope with serious hostile sympathetic magic and the like.  

- global-scale force projection: Can you mass-produce AI-controlled tanks &amp; aircraft, Planetary Annihilation -style?  Or perhaps grant/revoke powers to an unlimited army of minions?  Or maybe you just have an army Item consisting of millions of men equipped with the best levels of equipment available in-jump, with fiat-backed loyalty and recruiting to quickly make up losses?  Or the ability to make such whenever you want through massive-scale mind control?  Or a battle-harem of hundreds of guaranteed-loyal superman-level individuals?  Or perhaps the capability to make such whenever you want through power-granting perks and minion loyalty perks.  Or plenty of individual powers plus a duplication power so you can be in hundreds of places at once and overpowered at every place?  Or maybe you have strategic magic so mighty and versatile that you can destroy entire armies... on the opposite side of the world... while simultaneously tracking the flow of goods in Zimbabwe and banishing otherworldly spirits spread out over millions of square kilometers.  Strategic-scale versatile magic is a replacement for just about anything.  

- comparable non-combat capabilities: While violence is common in Shadowrun, a force that hopes to be powerful while remaining independent should be able to do just as much through indirect means as well.  Technically you can leverage enough military might to produce influence and/or economic power, but that takes time and effort.  Ideally you'll start out with infinite wealth, or some kind of massive-scale manufacturing power, or major powers that happen to be highly applicable in-setting like the ability to clean very large areas of pollution quickly and easily, or some kind of strategic-scale influence perk, Item, or power.  

- intelligence: You still need more to make sure that you don't end up as just a tool for others to manipulate or an obstacle they have to navigate around.  That could mean a global spy network Item, or it could mean a dozen different investigation and intelligence gathering perks put together so that you can outdo Tattletale(Worm) in your sleep, it could mean extremely high-end precog powers, or absurd levels of merged telepathy powers from a dozen different jumps, or absurd levels of merged technopathy powers from a dozen different jumps.  Perks for detecting and/or disrupting plots/schemes help too, as do personal intelligence boosters.",1556668884

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Lemme tell you about my 9th grade bio teacher and this one prick named Collen. Collen was a prick. He was one of those kids that acted like he had everything to offer but had nothing to really give. He was a huge troublemaker and did the absolute bare minimum in all his classes. 

Bio was my first period, so it's the first place I'd go in the morning to put my stuff down before wandering around until the day started. This day though I had gotten shit sleep so I put my stuff down and lay my head on the desk to try and get some napping in before I had to be truly awake.

Collen was also in the bio room, getting early morning tutoring from the teacher. The teacher was this nice little Asian lady who had only been teaching a couple of years at this point. She's going over a past test with him, and he's clearly not picking up on much of anything that she says, and so he's getting annoyed.

Eventually he's done with it. He slams the pencil down and say something like, ""fuck this crap"" and starts walking to the door. Before he can make it all the way out, my teacher yells for him, and he turns to face her. She just looks at him and goes ""You're a jackass. I don't know if you realize it, but I hear plenty of other kids talking about how annoying you are. If school was anything like survivor, you'd be first one voted off the island, and everyone would celebrate after."" She said it so smoothly like she was thinking it up as she was tutoring him. Me and the other couple of kids in the room are just silent. All he could muster was a ""Cool."" Before stepping out.

The bell rang and the rest of the class came in and nothing seemed to come of it all. Everything just continued like normal. I didn't have bio with Collen so I'm not sure if he behaved any differently in her class afterwards.",1556668884

If you want to use Deuce and Cait, a launcher like Layle is the perfect candidate as Layle's attacks are magical and he will benefits from Deuce magic attack up buffs.

&amp;#x200B;

For a general team composition involving Vaan, Deuce/Cait and another party (DPS, debuffer/ utility) will be better. Some good examples are:-

a) Vaan, Deuce/Cait, Kuja (DPS)

b) Vaan, Deuce/ Cait, Seymour (Debuffer)

c) Vaan, Deuce/ Cait, Beatrix (DPS)

d) Vaan, Deuce/ Cait, Setzer (Utility)

e) Vaan, Deuce/ Cait, Ace (DPS)

&amp;#x200B;

Do note that Vaan is excels in doing burst damage, not for endurance battles. He has only 5 uses of both of his skills and his EX. In terms of support, Deuce is better for Vaan than Cait because the magic attack up that she provide and her HP+ can ensure that Vaan won't get broken too much as Vaan's basic attacks is very lacking.",1556668884

"osugame","t5_2s3lm","Lol. Obviously the guy has confidence issues. Pointing them out and trying to tell him to fix it isn't gonna help. Indirectly forcing him to fix his confidence issues without calling them out is a better method. Me telling him to flip his perspective holds no value, him getting an idea that to try something new does, however.

You acknowledge that he's lacking self confidence but still setting limits to him.

&gt;Your fucking self-doubt in your thinking is clear as fucking day to me and it hurts so much pointing out something so clear to me yet you are still blind to it.

Try helping a friend like this and tell me how it turns out. He attacks all of your points not because he's correct, but because you keep **fucking** insulting him and keep using the word **fucking** every **fucking** time. In the end your approach accomplishes nothing because he didn't take in jack **fucking** shit. You can literally be right in every single thing you say, but he will listen to none of it because of your approach. He treats you as any other comment he gets and absorbs nothing.

Anyways, documenting shouldn't add too much to his plate if he has the time. If he doesn't have the time, I guess it shouldn't work. But the idea was to take away from the instinctual doubts like *""Ahh fuck I missed again Im so trash at this game""* away. Have his mind is on documenting it and the mindset potentially goes away.

Maybe the extraneous perspective thing was too broad, I agree. At the time, I literally just woke up, but there's most likely a better way to approach it. And there's also a better way to approach your method. You can take note of my over generalization and complete backwards mentality to yours, but I'll also take note of your method. Count the amount of times you gave the OP reason to validate his shit play and mentality. I count 5.",1556668885

You might’ve experienced a thread that got brigaded by a bunch of people who don’t actually post in the sub. /r/metal is one of the best metal communities online, especially because it’s free from right-wing “anti-PC” bullshit.

A lot of good death metal is also Nazi-free. All the Bolt Thrower-worship bands are left of center because of all their crust influence. Maybe the surface level death metal fans are shitheads, but there’s a lot of good people without shitty political views in the death metal scene.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","First off, I just want to say that you've made excellent points and I like that you're able to debate this without getting heated like everyone on this sub seems to once you get past 2 comments back and forth. You're very level headed and it helps your argument a lot! 

As for my response to your points, I can see what you mean about the Blues with what you say up to this point:

&gt;Can you honestly say that the Blues are worse than Senators or Oilers before the season ? Hell no.

And I agree with everything you've said up until that point. You're right, starting the season on paper the Blues were supposed to actually be one of the more dominant teams in the NHL with their offseason acquisitions. But it was more than just the goaltending that had problems. At one point we had the lowest Goals For in the entire league which is obviously not a problem that bringing in a new goaltender solved. Coaching helped there which is why Berube also got the nomination for Jack Adams, but for nearly everything else Binnington has pretty much been the solution. Our defense looks a hell of a lot better than it did originally, but to be honest it still looks pretty weak and I'm seeing Binnington have to make 1 to 2 desperation saves nearly every game. 

But what I'm trying to say is that no, before the season I wouldn't have said the Blues were going to be worse than the Senators or Oilers. But after watching 4 straight months of them prove that wrong, I was resigned to the fact that we were going to finish 31st in the league. I had 0 hope on Jan 1st that they'd ever turn it around. When they turned it around I was absolutely floored as a Blues fan. A team doesn't magically turn into a scoring powerhouse just because a goaltender starts heating up. And yet somehow, they did. Even when Berube first came on nothing seemed to change. It wasn't until Binnington's debut that they started dominating. I've never seen anything like it in my life as a hockey fan. 

As for how Binnington is not nominated for Vezina, his competition is other goaltenders who have more games under their belt with equally incredible stats. I think that when you're comparing goalie to goalie you have to look at games played very objectively and can say ""well obviously Binner didn't come close to the GP that Vasi did and he still had incredible stats"". 

But with Calder, my opinions on that are different. You shouldn't be able to compare goaltenders to skaters honestly. 32 games as a goalie is still a large chunk when you consider there are plenty of starters that only hit ~50. So when everyone says ""Binnington's played less than half the season"" that's technically true, but he's also played damn near the ENTIRE half of the season whereas plenty of other starters play ~15 games over half the season but they do it all season long. Add in the fact that no NHL goalie ever *starts* the first game of the season for a debut (goalies literally have to wait for 1 of 2 goalies to go down before they get a call up in nearly every case) whereas a skater can just get called up and poof you toss one of the other 12 forwards you've got down to the minors. 

Look I know he's not going to win it over Petey. But goalies aren't expected to get a call up at the start of the year so without taking candidates like this one seriously you'll never get Calder-winning goaltenders.",1556668890

I remember a foster parent supporting shock therapy and the agency didn't say shit about it. Being gay is a sin in foster care. Many foster parents don't support gay youth or gay couples. Funny, because gay couples might actually take in gay youth and other kids these straight married Christian couples don't want. 

I was abused and was told I was going to hell and I deserved the abuse because that was God's way of telling me to change my ways. So my innocence was taken from me because God needed to tell me to change my ways. Thanks foster care and Christian foster parents and agencies.

&gt; TOKYO - Japanese Emperor Akihito announced his abdication at a palace ceremony Tuesday in his final address, as the nation embraced the end of his reign with reminiscence and hope for a new era.

&gt; &amp;quot;Since ascending the throne 30 years ago, I have performed my duties as the emperor with a deep sense of trust in and respect for the people, and I consider myself most fortunate to have been able to do so. I sincerely thank the people who accepted and supported me in my role as the symbol of the state,&amp;quot; Akihito said in his last official duty as emperor.

I know that I’ll be fighting yellows who are security (that’s a given). I was going to have to fight them anyways, and I’ll fight anyone who has a phaser regardless of what shirt they were wearing. 

BUT..... I KNOW, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that anyone in red is important. They are either command, or bridge officers.

Others suggested challenges should be allowed as if fucking Guardiola would go up to the ref in the 20' and say ""Yeah mate, go have another look at that foul 40 yards away from goal""

"WhiteWolfRPG","t5_2u6fa","Oh for sure! Technocrats can make awesome villains (and even the Traditions can, though Technocrats also can be a bit more like monster-of-the-week depending on what your table wants to do). The Technocrats are definitely compelling villains.

One thing to keep in mind about Mage is that Paradigm, Practice, and Instruments are very important to think about for a character. That's probably one of the more difficult aspects of Mage. It's not just ""I whisper the magic words and wave my hands and magic happens!"" Your character needs to *believe* that their process does something—they need to have a world view explaining why they can do what they do (likely why not everyone can do it, and why others can do similar things even if they believe something differently). I do admit the game can be a bit more at times philosophical discussions about why the character can do what the dots on the sheet say (or better yet, why the character can do something creative, not mentioned in the book, and yet seems to fall within the sphere dots on their sheet). It's a bit more philosophical and cerebral. It can have politics similar to Vampire if you want, though that's not as inherently present as in Vampire. Also, if you just want to run around like dark superheros, Mage might not work too much like that. Each sphere dot is an array of abilities (or more loosely, a concept of what one can do) that are not always super concrete in how they function. Some of the key limits are the Technocracy if you're not a Technocrat (or hell, even if you are!), Paradox (reality itself and at times, actual witnesses disbelieving your crazy shenanigans), and the Mage player's own self doubts or paradigm limits.

My Technocrat character's Mind magick is inspired by the show *Lie to Me* (he reads and provides micro-expressions, plays with tone, body language, etc.). While he can do telepathy per Mind 3, that paradigm limits the idea of what he could convey or perceive telepathically, *and* he could not, for instance, convey anything telepathically (or even influence the mood/thoughts) of someone who can't perceive him. This paradigm can refine and evolve over time to fill the dots, or end up supplemented with technology/hypertech, but there are limitations based on the character's belief about how the world works.

Also, a prepared Mage with ritually casted effects for defense, perception, a plan, ability boosting, etc., is unbeatable. An unprepared Mage is barely better than a mortal. They're not as inherently resilient or combat capable as Vampires, though one can build a combat monster or something similar if desired.",1556668893
"coys","t5_2ryq7","I think we are at a crossroads as a club. Some ruthless decisions need to be taken on players currently in our squad (Trippier, Wanyama, Lamela etc.) and serious investment is needed in key areas. I’m not concerned about Poch because he has been hinting throughout the season that we need to operate in a different way and take the next step. It’s pretty clear to me he recognizes the crossroad. However, ultimately, Poch is not fully in charge of incomings and outgoings. It’s obvious that he wanted some players out last summer, which we were unable to sell and some players in, that we couldn’t get over the line. I’m going to give Levy and co the benefit of the doubt for last summer. The market radically changed financially, we were dealing with serious stadium issues and the World Cup didn’t help. Fortunately, it looks like we have gotten away with it if we get that 3rd/4th spot. 

This summer, there are no excuses. We have one of the best managers in the world, the best striker in the world, the best training facilities in the world, the best stadium in the world, hopefully CL football for a 4th consecutive season and playing in the richest league in the world. Everything is in place to get to the top of world football and the final step is how we act as a club in the transfer market. If Poch wants a player out, get them out, if Poch wants a player in, get them in. We aren’t bank rolled, I understand that we can’t bring in 200+ million worth of talent each window. However, no excuses for not spending 70-100 million on one or two key positions. 

This summer is the big one. Are we going to make that step-up? Let’s hope Levy was reading the South Stand tonight. To Dare Is To Do.",1556668893

"Defcon","t5_2qlnb","Define what 'best' means for you:

Closest? the conference is in Bally's/Paris, so you wouldn't have to leave the building, but getting a room there may be difficult at this point.

Highest quality? the rooms in Bally's are dilapidated, in my experience, but the Bellagio is just across the street. It's nice, but not cheap. The Vdara and the Aria are also nearby, but also not cheap.

Most affordable? the Linq is fairly inexpensive and has decent rooms. It is about a block north - probably ~15 min walk if you include the time it takes you to get down the elevator from your room, walk through the casino floor out to the street, wait to cross the road, and walk through Bally's to get to the conference center. You might also consider the Platinum, which is a block back from the strip, but on Flamingo Rd with Bally's.",1556668893

"CrusaderKings","t5_2tgic","R5: This happened after a couple of disastrous games from the 769 start where things wen't horribly wrong for France/Lombardy/All Catholics. In one, both French Kings were killed or deposed inside a decade. In another the papacy was conquered by Pagans by 880. Moral Authority for the Catholic Church hit zero pretty fast both times. So I decided that as long as Catholicism was going to fail to launch, I could take advantage and do a bit of a retry of my first ever game. I started in Wessex and eventually converted to Catharisim. But that save game is now several versions out of date and I never did see my religion become the new one true faith.

&amp;#x200B;

But the game, it knows. Somehow it can sense these things. It knows that I have a plan to take advantage of this nonsense to finally see a Catholic Heresy become legitimate. So what does the game do? Holy Roman Empire, 21 May, 792. I...didn't even know that was an option.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not backing down though. This will make the game plan substantially more difficult than it was during my first game, but I'm also a (slightly) better player now, so it seems a fitting challenge.

So clench thy butt hole and grab ye lube. It's going to be a rough ride, but Wessex and the Cathar faith will rise again!

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","DJ\_Hall gives a good explanation of how the devices get to the right place. 

In terms of loops, there are two kinds, L3 (Routing) and L2 (Switching).

Since you are opting to let the router do all of the routing we can eliminate those unless something truly crazy is happening. 

L2 (Switching) loops are prevented by STP (Spanning tree protocol) which uses math and science to generate a loop free path (Lets leave it at ""magic"" for this discussion). It is suppose to stop all loops, and it does, but you'll probably want to disable it on the switch your using to merge into a trunk. As long as you configure everything correctly you should not be creating any loops since there is only a single port per VLAN. 

Loops can only happen if you have more then one path. You should only have one if you do things as I listed. Either way, probably an after hours move. With Cisco switches until you save the config, a reboot will fix it right up.",1556668896

In these situations I doubt they will ever be because when someone (james) doesn't respect ""No"" they also don't respect the rest of what is said, they hear/read WHAT THEY WANT. Anytime it isn't ""No I am saying explicitly I do not want any sexual relationship with you"" is taken as a ""mixed message"" or playing hard to get. And we are told to be polite,  so we rarely say NO so harshly. But ""letting them down gently"" doesn't work with people who don't respect others.  And I think we have enough examples of James not respecting ""straight"" guys' Nos.  And to me, that's the point.  It's ""fine"" for James to inflict damage and create his own narrative of every situation, while he holds everyone else to a different standard. All his mistakes are ok bc hes ""only a teenager"".

There's some fundamental miss in both Marx and Lenin that doesn't take into account some important  natural human factors issue, and that seems to cause communist states to be forced to resort to ""reprogramming"" people in various ways.

How does the calendar look any better for the next 4 games than it did for the last 4?

Parma were the most out of form team in the league, and we couldn’t get 3 points.

We were dominated from start to finish at Sampdoria.

Played like shit vs Udinese.

Made Torino look like Atletico Madrid.

But at the same time I just wanted to see Rosen move the offense or show those flashes you want to see.

His first game was honestly really awesome but after that it really became bleak.

And then as the season progressed he got worse and worse and started over throwing many receivers. 

Everybody in the building from keim to the players all defended Rosen and still have after being traded . It would’ve been very easy for anybody to throw Rosen under the bus but not one person did.

Wider? Yes. Taller, not really. If you go back and look at pics, it's not as big as one would've imagined. The only tall part is the actual main castle's wall.

&gt;wight must be killed or else it will keep attacking at full strength

This part actually confuses me. We can see very clearly in Jorah's final stand that a single slash to any part of the body kills them instantly. Need to go back and confirm, but I'm under the impression that a single slash or stab kills them, as does how White Walkers die (seen with both Valyrian steel and dragonglass).

&gt;focused the enemy's attack to a relatively small surface area  
&gt;  
&gt;area of Winterfell that must be defended by an onslaught is much larger

True, I'd agree with that. I guess we can even the playing fields by discussing from the point AFTER the walls have been breached (e.g. Elven archers prepared for shooting upon breach). But going back to the major point, Winterfell could've done a heck of a lot better job in coordination and strategy. Dragons were also utilized so poorly.

&gt; China Building Hundreds Of Coal-Fired Power Plants Abroad China has taken dramatic steps to fight climate change, including shutting major coal power plants.

&gt; Edward Cunningham, a specialist on China and its energy markets at Harvard University, tells NPR that China is building or planning more than 300 coal plants in places as widely spread as Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt and the Philippines.

&gt; In one sense, China&amp;#039;s push for coal is not surprising: China knows how to build coal plants.

I’m not familiar with Tim Horton’s specifically, but it really doesn’t surprise me that they are also experiencing low sales due to Winter. I imagine they, like all restaurants, make more sales during the summer months. People tend to go out more during the Summer than during Winter.

"SQL","t5_2qp8q","Having interviewed many candidates myself, I agree on the certs comment.  Certs are about memorizing something at the time, specific to the test.  

[u/JayTee1597](https://www.reddit.com/user/JayTee1597), experience is going to matter more than certs ever would.  I'm not sure what your background is in.  

If you've got a degree in elementary education and want to transition from a high school teacher to a SQL developer ,it is going to be near impossible to come in off the street after a cert.  

If you work a different job in IT, helpdesk maybe, but want to get into the SQL side of it, you're probably going to have to find a position or company that will be willing to let you take on some SQL responsibilities.  It's almost impossible to go straight from one IT field to another overnight with just a cert.  You'll have to be that guy, JayTee1597 who works help desk but everyone knows is pretty good at SQL and gets some of that work thrown at him.

If you're straight out of college with a psychology degree and a SQL cert, again, it will be difficult.   It was very common in the past for developers to come from any degree program, but it's becoming less common the way that job requirements are structured by HR. 

If you're straight out of college with an IT or CompSci degree, a cert might help a very small bit.  But you'll have no issues gaining an entry-level job with that type of degree anyways. 

As far as a SQL interview goes, to stand out, you will need to do more than come in with a cert, and say that you remember what SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY and HAVING do.  (It's even quite common for recent grads to not remember the difference between WHERE and HAVING).  If you can demonstrate critical thinking within a SQL environment, that will go far.  As I interview candidates mostly for SQL Server, I am thinking about examples such as speaking about the design of a complex query where you tried different techniques to optimize for performance and used the execution plan as a guide.  For example, demonstrating that you know how to use and when to make a choice between subquery/derived tables, CTEs, #temp tables, and @table variables would go far in an interview with me.  It just takes practice.  Work on a SQL problem, and then work it under a different solution.",1556668901

Even passwords and accounts to be closed are recorded. I know it’s just the dumb, mundane stuff, it’s something that I can do for them now, while I’m still young and healthy, so it’s one or two fewer things they’ll have to deal with.

From Iron Man - ""proof Tony has a heart"", the fact that Tony likes cheeseburgers, and that Tony wishes he could have said goodbye to his father

From Iron Man 2 - when Tony says ""it's always you"" at the end of his recording in the Benatar, it references when he made Pepper CEO and said ""it's you. it's always been you"". Additionally, this film fleshes out Tony's relationship with his father.

From Thor 1 and Captain America 1 - the city where Odin fought the frost giants and where Red Skull found the tesseract is Tønsberg, the same city where New Asgard is placed in this movie. 

From Captain America 1 - ""I could do this all day"", and then Cap and Bucky's lines when they say goodbye to each other at the start of this film are the same as when they say goodbye at the end of Endgame except switched - Cap says what Bucky said before and Bucky says what Cap said before. ""Don't do anything stupid."" ""you're taking all the stupid with you.""

From Captain America 2 - ""On your left"" &amp; the elevator scene

Age of Ultron - the things that Tony is mad at Cap for saying were said in Age of Ultron. ""We'll lose."" ""Then we'll do that together too.""

Ant-man - establishes that Hank Pym used to work at shield

&gt; China Building Hundreds Of Coal-Fired Power Plants Abroad China has taken dramatic steps to fight climate change, including shutting major coal power plants.

&gt; Edward Cunningham, a specialist on China and its energy markets at Harvard University, tells NPR that China is building or planning more than 300 coal plants in places as widely spread as Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt and the Philippines.

&gt; In one sense, China&amp;#039;s push for coal is not surprising: China knows how to build coal plants.

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Making some generalizations here, and sorry for the long read:

A share in a company represents fractional ownership--if you own 0.1% of a company's shares, you own 0.1% of the company (more or less). This comes with the benefits of owning a company: you get a fraction of the company's earnings and other proceeds, and you may also get voting rights, all in proportion to the % you own. Stock prices, and therefore share prices, may rise or fall based on 'intangible' factors, like speculation leading before new product release, but they're mostly driven by tangible factors like the company's assets, liabilities, revenue, etc. 

Imagine a company that builds digital tablets or something. If the tablets suck (i.e, they don't provide functional value to consumers), no one will buy them, the company's liabilities will exceed its revenues and assets, it'll have to downsize or divest assets, and its $$ valuation, and therefore the $$ valuation of its stock, will drop. On the other hand, if the tablets empower people in new ways (i.e., they provide functional value), people will buy them; the company will grow its revenue, invest that into new assets, and expand, and the value of its stock will rise. To be clear, the company sells a product, in this case tablets, to generate revenue, and this revenue determines its valuation, and therefore the valuation of its stock. The stock **is** the company.

So two key points here: 

* If you want to invest in this company, you buy shares in it--you don't buy, like, 300 of its tablets and hold onto them expecting them to increase in price**\*** ^(see footnote). 
* Since a company's stock more or less **is** the company, shares directly and tangibly reflect the fortunes of the company.

Crypto is different. Crypto coins and tokens are not a fraction of a company; instead, **they are the product** (or a part of the product) the company (or team or non-profit organization) produces--that is, they are a 'thing' designed to do something, just like the tablets in the example above.

If you look at how crypto projects are funded, you'll find various models. Some developers are paid by community donations. But a few years ago, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) became a popular way to get a project off the ground. These are similar to venture capital funding or a Kickstarter campaign, in that you take in money based on an idea and then use it to deliver the idea (or not--you could instead take the money and run since the space is unregulated). 

Now, take a step back for a second and think about this. If you buy a product as part of Kickstarter campaign, you're buying the product and making a donation to the developers, but you **aren't** buying a share in the company that makes the product. Their obligation to you ends with them sending you the product they promised you. Likewise, if you buy a coin or token in an ICO, you're buying a product produced by the developers, but that's the end of their financial obligation to you. You give them your money, they give you a thing in return, and that's it. Even in the case of a non-ICO project (usually older ones like BTC, LTC, Doge, etc.), if you buy it on an exchange, that money goes to the person selling it to you, not to the developers or the foundation overseeing the project--so again, the project has no obligation to you. Either way, you're paying market prices for a product, and that's the end of the relationship. 

I hope it's becoming clear here that unlike a share in a company, a crypto coin does not represent fractional ownership of the entity that created it. It **does** represent a share (ish) of a blockchain, but a blockchain isn't a company--it's also a product. Ultimately a token or coin has relatively little, and in many cases no, intrinsic value**\*\*** ^(see footnote). Which leads to a key point:

* The value of a given coin or token is related to the 'stuff' that it, and the blockchain it's part of, does, and how well it does it. But **the price of a token is 100% solely determined by market forces**\--there is no explicit connection to the income/assets/whatever of the entity that produced it.

With a share in a company, there is a direct and, for the most part, mathematically predictable relationship between the company's finances and the price of its stock. With a crypto coin or token, price is driven by supply and demand. Historically, demand has been driven by speculation (like, I want to hold Bitcoin not because I want to do anything with it but because I think it will increase in value), which led to the craziness of 2017/2018. Assuming that speculation can't sustain a market forever, that brings up two questions:

* What would need to happen for crypto prices to be driven by something 'real'?
* To what extent are the interests of a crypto project and the interests of its token holders aligned?

The answer to the first question relates to real-world utility that can be quantified in actual $$, but it also relates to the answer to the second question. That answer varies, and sometimes it's 'not very much'. For example, quite a few projects issued tokens as an easy way to make money (ICO) during the craze, but lack strong connections between the success of the idea and demand for the token. That is, they are not built around a strong mechanism for token appreciation. This is especially true of utility (non-currency) projects. It's possible, and not uncommon, for a project to have a good idea that provides value, but for the 'blockchain' part to be tacked on and not really necessary after the initial funding stage. That would be fine if we were investing in the entity (company or whatever) that made the blockchain, but that's not what we're doing. We're investing in tokens.

In order for a project's tokens to appreciate, there needs to be a clear connection to use and, especially for utilities, to actual $$. Which leads to the final, and probably most important point:

* The price of a stock is determined by **what it is**\--a fraction of a company. By contrast, the price of a crypto token is determined by **how it is used**, and, in the case of utility tokens, **how directly $$ spent on the network are reflected in token use**.

...and *that* is why it's important to treat them differently, and do your research to ensure that any coins or tokens you invest in have both strong use-cases, and strong connections between use and token appreciation. 

Hope this helped.

\**In the few cases where you might do this--think of, say, buying a bunch of Beanie Babies in 1999 to sell to collectors in 2019--note that the ultimate price of the thing you're holding is unrelated to the success of the company. Like, the price that collectors are willing to pay you for your Beanie Baby is completely unrelated to how Ty (the manufacturer) is doing financially.*

\*\**You'll run into debates about the exact answer here. Some make the case that, for example, to mine a Bitcoin you need thousands of dollars in equipment and electricity, that paying this entails a vested interest in the success and security of the blockchain, and that therefore a Bitcoin has intrinsic value as the tokenization of that initial investment to produce it. Others point to other perks, like governance, as providing intrinsic value. But whatever intrinsic value a token might or might not have, it's derived from the value of the BLOCKCHAIN that its a part of, not of the entity that created it. And of course in a more literal sense you could argue that no crypto token has intrinsic value: e.g., if you're stuck by yourself on a desert island with 1 BTC, it has zero value to you--you can't burn it, melt it down, eat it, build with it, or even use it as a paperweight.*",1556668906

&gt; If you want to continue, debate the concept that the women were excluded from this theme because of political narrative. But it seems you agree to that already. 

I'm just wondering why it's *that* important. Like I said before, ""It's just a movie."" Characters don't have to be ""relatable"" in the ways that some people want them to. It honestly amazes me that people look on the movie screen and want to see themselves or certain parts of their own mental world on it, and the person who came up with the idea doesn't have to share a certain person's views on a particular thing. That's likely not what the movie is going to be about.

&gt;Ultimately, it’s saddening that women can’t pursue the family theme like the men did.

Seems like it would be more logical to just make some exceptions in the law for these instances than to just dismiss it with a hand wave and say it’s fine because it’s a minority of felons. As if it’s either ALL felons can vote or NO felons can vote, which is a false dichotomy; you can allow some/most felons to vote if you write the law as such.

Buckle up, sit back, and enjoy what two hours of ~~wasted time~~ writing can do.

____________________________________________________


#Cold Ilian Soul

Noah, who has fallen in love, rebukes this feeling. In his own way, he shows concern for every character he supports with. At the same time, he protests to containing any semblance of romance or care for another person in several of these supports as well. In his C Supports with Juno and Zelot he asks them if they’re alright unprompted, just concerned for them… Then he goes on to try and prove that he rejects his emotions to the both of them.

Zelot’s supports in particular educate us on Noah’s outlook. In their B support, it’s explained that the mercenaries of Ilia write letters that are handed out to loved ones when they die, basically their last words. Noah has nobody he wants to give his to; he settles for giving it to Zelot with the reasoning being that Zelot is the reason that he even got that far to begin with. It’s understandable why he’d do this even post Fir A support, as perhaps he’s not the sentimental type of person who would want to hurt Fir by making her read something like that. He may not even know what to write for it considering how bottled up he is beforehand. Noah’s reasoning for Zelot being the one chosen isn’t even out of compassion or affection, at the least not openly. He simply states that it’s because of Zelot being the man who taught him everything. 

In this same support, Noah comments on the blood of Ilia being outsourced to other countries as mercenaries and questions how Zelot feels on the matter. He says that other countries have called Ilians Vultures, and honestly my first thought was the Ravens of Kilvas, said to not be loyal and seen only as mercenaries that are watched by all. The A support is important, but we’ll come back to it soon enough.


##Ilian Presence


In Zelot’s B and A supports, we learn of two other Ilians: Grant and Sieks.   
In Trec’s B Support with him, we learn about Casis.      
In Juno’s B support with him, we learn about Sigune.       

Let’s take a look at these one at a time, beginning with Sigune, Juno’s rival, as she is the only one that is not initially brought up by Noah. Juno says that Sigune was kind, and that the outcome of their rivalry is only a result of war. In response, Noah says:  

&gt;...Yes. But that's what war is.       

Of course, one might simply see this as Noah’s acceptance of the subject. Detached from the person that’s brought up, he may also find it easier to pass over the death as just a product of war. However, the cibversation between Noah and Trec about another Ilian, Casis, proves that Noah’s thoughts may be a bit more complex than that.

Noah tells Trec that Casis, someone they studied together with, was hired by Bern and died in the field. That brings up this exchange within the B Support.

&gt;Noah: Mercenaries are in high demand right now... We could have ended up fighting him if we were unlucky.     
&gt;Trec: Well... We're for hire, you know. It happens.     
&gt;Noah: Well, I guess you're right... I really envy that personality of yours…     

This exchange is important because even though Noah tells Juno that he understands that war brings on killing their own friends and classmates, his tone becomes different when the person who’s dead is someone that he personally knew. Trec’s response of “It Happens” makes Noah Envious because Trec’s detached and carefree personality allows him to cut himself off from the prospect of murdering someone they once trained with. This also separates Noah from Trec; compared to the situation between Sigune and Noah, Noah and Trec both knew Casis. Noah ends up showing himself as a more emotional person than Trec, or at the least a more apprehensive and thoughtful person. 

This is further supported by the presence of the last two Ilians mentioned: Grant and Sieks. Noah brings these two up as well in his B Support with Zelot. After a short discussion on how he remembers training with them, he even wonders on how they’re doing as well. 

In the A support between the two, Grant is confirmed dead. Zelot has his will, and he offers it to Noah. Noah refuses with a simple “No.”, and the two go on with the battle. I don’t think Noah refuses out of apathy though; I believe seeing that will would have probably broken him. Zelot, the veteran, was troubled by both the knowledge and the letter to the point where Noah felt the desire to ask if everything was okay.  I doubt Noah would do any better.

______________________________    

###Ilian Statistics

Four Ilian Mercenaries aside from the six we see, and three of the unseen ones represent Noah’s greatest fears about coming from Mercenary Land.

Sigune: Confirmed an Enemy (Death unconfirmed, Skirmish confirmed).     
Grant: Killed in Battle (Allegiance Unconfirmed, though Zelot calls him “Comrade”).       
Casis: Confirmed an Enemy. Confirmed Dead.       

Add up the fact that Thea starts off an enemy by the time that Noah and friends are joined, and that means 40% of  Ilian Mercenaries mentioned in this game will have been on the other side. Juno and Zelot also **met** as enemies on the battlefield before marriage in a previous conflict, meaning that all the obtainable Ilians will have been confirmed to have fought (or the potential to fight) against someone else from Ilia that isn’t even attached to the cause they fight for beyond money.     

_______________________________

##Ilian Influence

Unlike characters from Bern, who are turning coat or have some sort of justifiable regret for abandoning their home or fighting their homeland, Noah has no excuse. This is what his country does for a living. Nobody is betraying anybody. It’s just business, and he has to accept it or potentially starve.

Taking a look at his A support with Juno, it becomes apparent that this is not the view of every other Ilian soldier however. 

&gt;Juno: Noah.   
&gt;Noah: Yes?   
&gt;Juno: You seem to avoid developing close relationships. Is that because you don't want to suffer from losing that person?   
&gt;Noah: ...I wonder. It is easier to just avoid getting close with anyone. The tighter the bond, the greater the suffering when that bond is broken. ...I think you know that better than any of us.   
&gt;Juno: Yes... Perhaps it's better to live like you do in Ilia. But there will come a time when you will realize that close relationships aren't all bad. Maybe you'll understand when you find yourself in love with someone.   


The Ilian Lifestyle is indeed a brutal one, and yet contrasting to the negative view of Noah, are alternative hopeful views of the pegasus knights. There are many ways to get through living in Ilia. For some, such as Juno, it’s through love. After all, she met Zelot because the two were hired to fight against each other. She made the best of that situation and strives for a better future. For others, such as Noah, it’s through closing yourself off. Noah isn’t all Ilian doom and gloom though, and now we’ll start to get into some of his warmer moments. 

________________________________________________
##Cold Knight’s Paradise


The first person he comes closest to sharing Warmth that you can recruit is Trec. Most of their conversations reminded me a lot of Shikamaru and Choji chilling as kids. They don’t talk about much, just… what they did on vacation and what others they knew are up to. Their C support made me laugh more than any other support ever with this exchange about Trec’s fishing: 

&gt;Noah: Sounds exactly like something you would do. What can you catch?   
&gt;Trec: Nothing. It's just fun to sit there staring off into space, holding the string.   
&gt;Noah: ...You really live life to the fullest.   
&gt;Trec: What were you doing?   
&gt;Noah: ...... ...Nothing much, really.   

It’s not just funny though, it’s educational. Ilia’s a fucking wasteland. Of course there’s nothing, and yet I don’t know why I was surprised when their idea of taking a vacation was **this**. It’s desolate and boring, but there’s still a sense of the two being friends. We discussed their B support, which is its own conversation, but then we have the A support. 

In the A support, Noah comes to the conclusion that It’s futile to make a difference, with the following exchange occuring.

&gt;Trec: Well... That's all right, too.    
&gt;Noah: It is...?     
&gt;Trec: Yeah. At least I think so. We go through hard times, but isn't that all part of life?    
&gt;Noah: ...Maybe so. ...Hey, Trec.   
&gt;Trec: Yeah?  
&gt;Noah: Take me along the next time you go fishing.  


It’s cute. It’s just two guys talking about the state of life as a soldier, and yet the simple idea of doing *nothing*, like ***literally nothing*** but stare into space with a fucking piece of string in the water is an oddly satisfying ending. They’ll have peace, for a while, and they can sit down and relax. They don’t think they can make a difference, but they also don’t feel too saddened by it. I think it’s mundane, but it reminded me a lot of my own time with my best friend. We’d often talk about where our place is in life, what we should be doing, and (occasionally) coming to the conclusion that perhaps we can’t change too much.

"HPfanfiction","t5_2t100","As people said, write what you want, if you want to read your story, then there are other people who also would. But if you want to know taste of people :

* Tries to escape the biggest cliche (lord potter, magical inheritance, slytherin full of seasoned 11 years old politicians, manipulative Dumbledore, Weasleys only friends for money . . .)
* If you don't write a full AU, some events from canon are inavoidable (Voldemort probably try to steal the stone, Lockart will be there for year 2 or the Triwizard Tournament will happen), but if your character is different, some scene should not exist. (For example, I remember seeing a Slytherin Harry where Draco still wants a midnight duel, Harry lives in the same room as him and yet still go to Trophee room, and still tries to escape to 3rd flood corridor even if as a Slytherin it's like the exact opposite direction from his dorm). 
* I guess it's a matter of taste, but some expression are so overused it may be best to not use them (I cannot imagine Sirius ever calling Harry Pup or Prongslet, except in the sole objective of messing with him when he reacts to this, same for Remus and Cub). 
* Characterization is important, Seer Luna is not really canon compliant and a bit overused, Hermione is not Perfect (not matter what movie want you to think) and Ron is not a complete idiot that just barely passes class by copying Hermione (academicly speaking, the only notable difference between his grades and Harry's is that Harry is better in Defense, for the rest they have close grades).",1556668910

Technically she *is* alive, when they wanted a returning character to be a villian they had the choice of Lilly or Christa. They didn't think it would fit Christa's character to kidnap kids so they went with Lilly.
(At least I think that's right I forgot where this was said) 


Also, I think it could have been cool to see Christa as a villian to Clementine. Not saying I wish she was but I think there could have been cool and emotional conversation between them even more than Lilly and Clem. Christa raised Clementine for about a year (I forgot the exact amount) . And she probably believed Clementine died after they were attacked. That would weigh so much on her if she believed she lost what kept her going. Wow imagine the scene where Lilly was escaping on the raft but with Christa. It could have been so much more emotional and the thing Clementine said about them being family would hit so much harder with Christa instead. Or imagine an alternate scenario where they are In a fist fight on the burning boat. Christa could say something about how she didn't show it much but she loved Clementine when they survived together and she almost gave up after she thought she lost her. That could be a reason she didn't go to Wellington. It was guilt. And she'd talk about how the Delta gave her people to care about again and that's why she fercely protected it and went along with kidnapping people. Christa would get the upper hand and (depending on your choices) would try to kill Clementine or stop and help her escape. Maybe this could contribute to what AJ will become. He could have seen Christa as a monster like Marlon before this happens. And if you 

A: manage to get Christa redeemed AJ will learn that people CAN change. (And also learn something about being humane and trusting)

Or 

B: if Christa trys to kill Clementine AJ learns that some people are too far gone (and also learn something about survival)


Which could also contribute to some huge ending decision AJ needs to make. It could be a balance of learning how to survive without losing humanity. I feel there could be a satisfying ""Dark ending"" and a ""good ending"" (if enough time is given to figure it out.




Lol I'm so sorry this spawned from a meme about Christa but I love making rants and alternative storylines like this. Id love to make some kind of AU story like the choice based games (but more focused on story rather than gameplay, visuals,sounds etc. 

Maybe one day.

""While eminent domain was never used in conjunction with the project, the specter of it was controversial from the start. O’Rourke was among those on the council who at least initially wanted to preserve the option of eminent domain as a last resort and, for example, helped defeat a June 2006 motion to rule it out. A month later, as public concerns were growing about the plan, the council — including O’Rourke — voted to ban the use of eminent domain during the first year of the project.""

They don't move their shit out, it comes with the house; the new owners just toss it or leave it all. It's so bizarre compared to every move I've ever made, but I've always rented so maybe it's normal? Just seems weird that people have paid a fortune and hand-picked every stick of furniture and every piece of art, every nick nack... then they just leave it and buy new shit.

&gt; China Building Hundreds Of Coal-Fired Power Plants Abroad China has taken dramatic steps to fight climate change, including shutting major coal power plants.

&gt; Edward Cunningham, a specialist on China and its energy markets at Harvard University, tells NPR that China is building or planning more than 300 coal plants in places as widely spread as Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt and the Philippines.

&gt; In one sense, China&amp;#039;s push for coal is not surprising: China knows how to build coal plants.

It's never happened.

The Revolutionary War in the US is much different than the situation is Venezuela. It was the colonies collectively working together with a common government and army against another country. This is more like a civil war. The Civil War in the US is an example you are seeking, except it was unsuccessful for the people resisting the government. Not saying the current dictator in Venezuela is the good guy or anything, just saying having guns isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere. This is a complex situation and I'm not saying people shouldn't be able to rise up and fight for what they believe, I'm simply saying that having a gun doesn't give you the power you necessarily think it does. Unorganized civilians with guns is not an Army, has no infrastructure, and is not a match for a military or police forces. The best thing people can do is continue to protest, I don't think a few shootouts in the streets are going to change much.

A suggestion I have would be : 

- Create organized lines with barricades or something. Last year people who waited for a long time got jumped in on because there was no system.

- Increase the Merch staffing or make a second booth.

- Have a separate booth for people picking up pre-orders. I had friends who preordered jackets but spent almost an hour waiting in line with everyone else buying stuff. Plus this would cut down on some of the chaos I think

- They were digging through boxes for sizes last year which seemed to take forever. I think you need a better system. Maybe racks or shelves?

"politics","t5_2cneq","Rage-induced mass shootings do not require the shooter to have a conceal carry permit, unfortunately.

The problem is that while it is difficult to get a conceal carry permit in Colorado, it’s absurdly easy to buy guns anyway.  Any person over 18 years old that can pass a low-level background check run by the store can buy long guns, and anyone over 21 can buy hand guns too.  Open carry is permit-free, so in a way, the mass shooter isn’t even breaking the law until they’re inside the building and fire the first shot.

The minimal burden at the bottom - requiring a safety course and issuing through police department (naturally skeptical of citizens having guns) rather than a private dealer (who actively wants to sell guns - as many as possible) - makes the big difference in gun violence. 

I’d be curious to know how many mass shooters had concealed carry permits though.",1556668913

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","Nebula and Gamora were there. Nakia and Sif weren't even in the movie, and I'm sure they would have put Nakia in the scene if they got Lupita Nyong'o in the movie. Sif would probably raise to many questions. I already explained to you why it's a stupid to compare to 12 male characters showing up. 
The reason there aren't as many female characters, is because the people that watch these movies used to be mainly men, but it's starting to change, which is why you're starting to see more female characters on screen. There also aren't nearly as many iconic female Marvel characters to adapt to the big screen as there are male characters, which makes it more difficult to have as many females on screen. Not to mention that having more female characters, just for the sake of having as many of them as male characters is the wrong way to go about it. If the character is great, and there's a big demand for it, make a movie about him or her. Don't make a movie about a character, just because she's a woman.
The point is that the scene was forced and genuinely took people out of the movie, men and women alike. The characters didn't gather there because the story warranted it, they didn't even know each other, and after they had their girl power money shot, they didn't even do anything together, they just went about killing goons individually.

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","Thanks for the in depth reply, I appreciate it a lot

I'm gonna need to re read it to get the most out of it for sure, lot of info in there, but I can see how in depth this is, and how ""capitalism vs socialism"" is way too vague of a thing to say. 

I am definitely guilty to an extent of using that vague argument, clearly,  as that's how we got here lol. By no means am I the type to screech and call everything socialism, though. My thing is that I lean right/libertarian as opposed to left/authoritarian, so my beliefs combined with how shit the US govt is makes me want to push for less govt overall, rather than more. I was unaware of how much of an impact the subsidies really have, definitely something I need to look into much further. Also, I agree that 1930-70's seemed like a really good time for this countries growth and made it the super power it is today, so I need to look into that time period more and figure out what it was that caused it, and you've already started that process for me, so thanks. I have been getting into it a bit more recently, specifically regarding the time period of the civil rights movement though and the effects of that

Everything is so complicated, nothing is black/white and that's something I need to stay aware of, that seems to be my main takeaway from your response lol. I think these labels are messing with my ability to actually understand what's going on, too easy for people to denounce entire arguments by labeling something or someone. 

Sorry there's not much substance in my response to yours, it's only because I see I still have a lot to understand. I do agree with a lot of what you said, I accept that the corporations have way too much power, but I just don't trust ""the government"" because since I've been alive, I'm 21, they haven't done much to show me that I should trust them, especially to induce massive changes to the way the country runs. For example, I like the idea of everybody being covered when it comes to healthcare, but, I don't trust those in charge, or those wanting to be in charge to actually achieve that. It's Dems who push for that, so you have to look at what else they're pushing, medicare for all, free college, debt forgiveness, reparations, extended welfare, etc all combined is where they lose me, I just don't want the country to crumble and I can't get anyone to explain to me how all of those things together could possibly be payed for. The imminent death threat of climate change by the Dems also turns me off, clearly it is a problem but these doomsday countdowns are a huge turn off, as this has happened many times throughout our history and the world still stands. Back on topic- universal healthcare alone definitely sounds good, something NEEDS to be done with healthcare, but again I just get caught up in the politics of both parties, ya know? I feel the parties in the US are just going further and further to their respective sides, sowing more and more division

My final, unrelated thought: this response by you is extraordinarily better, and more thoughtful than any response I've gotten from the politics &amp; democrats sub, my main goal with reddit is to make sure I read all sides to get as close to the full picture as I can get on each issue, and alls I get over there is name calling, or I just get denounced with labels, so again, thanks for actually giving me a full ass response here, I truly appreciate it. That's why I use this website and I have seriously been losing hope lately because of the stark division between all of the political subs, so this was nice",1556668914

Not to mention the toughness to shake off a brutal hit from Quinnen Williams and the mental resilience to play great football and compete your heart out even down 28-0 and knowing your defense could very well not get a single stop all game.

--------------------------------------------------

Imo, there was a ton of good stuff to take from the game:

-proved he could improve and adapt to a defense within a game.

-proved he didn't shrink in big moments.

-proved he was mentally and physically tough.

-proved he trusted all his guys, not just CeeDee and Hollywood, big plays to his FB, TE, and his 50-yard bomb to a guy who caught 21 passes the whole year. Didn't stop trusting Hollywood even with him dropping passes and not being full speed.

-showed all the traits that actually are exciting about him, willingness to stay in the pocket, ability to escape the pocket, ability to make tight window and high-end accuracy throws, high-end arm strength, high-end throw on the run, ability to make touch passes, and ability to complete passes to all 3 levels of the field.

-----------------------------------------------

Yes, he made mistakes, but I expect college QBs to make mistakes, especially coming against a team like Bama I don't consider them too much of an indictment. 

When you can take a guy's worst game, against a top 2 team in the country, and can still make a cutup of him showing all the traits that will make him successful at the next level, I think that says a lot about what kind of player he is. Not to mention him doing this in his first year starting.",1556668916

My husband and I are 34 and have been trying for almost 3 years. I have PCOS, so fell pregnant after around a year but hcg was sluggish and it was a blighted ovum. We them started medicated cycles, but unfortunately had a TFMR at 12 weeks. We had all the karotype testing done and neither of us are carriers, it was just “bad luck”. Then after a few more medicated cycles we fell pregnant again but had a missed miscarriage at 9 weeks (with different chromosomal issues). Then a chemical pregnancy at the end of last year.  

So then we pulled the trigger on PGS tested IVF, and after my first cycle was cancelled, we got the meds right the second go and retrieved 11 eggs. Only 4 fertilized, but somehow all of them made it to day 5, and 3 of them are good to go (the 4th they didn’t get enough material from so it’s there as a backup and can be retested if need be)! This pregnancy is my first FET, so I feel pretty lucky but also pretty nervous given this is our 5th pregnancy with no baby in sight.

Families in high-tax, high-cost states have a reduced - $10,000 deduction on what they pay in state and local taxes. That would be blue states - California, Oregon, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Delaware, Maryland. A tax structure weaponized against blue states specifically. There is no tax for not having health insurance, forcing insurance costs up because fewer people will buy it. And after personal cuts expire in 2025, many of the lower income brackets will be worse off. And the tax bill had a rider allowing more drilling in Alaska Wildlife Refuge - a big plus for oil and related corporations like the Koch brothers.

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","Let's try the question the other way around. Was your seeking God entirely selfless? Was there nothing you were seeking for yourself? Were you seeking only for those around you so that you might be the light for them? How is it even possible to be entirely selfless?

Those who seek to save there lives shall loose it. Those who seek to loose their lives are saved. This requires a continual renewing of our minds that we need to seek God for God's sake and for everyone sake except our own. Our seeking should be from the perspective that we will be persecuted for this endeavor, but He will be glorified.  

Trying to be selfless is how we develop the fruits of the spirit. Where we put others needs before ours. How can I be unkind to someone I Love more than I Love myself? How could I not be patient with them? If I don't Love everyone more then myself, then I might do something that one with good fruit wouldn't do. 

When we get alone with Love and receive His Love, we should in turn become more Loving if not, then why would we receive more Love. So we have to Love Love and seek Love so that we can Love others more than we Love ourselves.",1556668919

I NEVER considered cheating on him even when drunk. I cared for him too deeply. Even though he ended up being the biggest jerk ever and cheated on me. I would never want to do that to ANYONE. 

I’m sorry but being drunk isn’t an excuse. I’m sure there are people that come out stronger after giving their partner a second chance but most of the time a second chance shouldn’t be given.  That’s what I’ve learned from experience.

If you do give her that second chance be prepared to always feel like you can’t trust her. The relationship will not be the same and you might end up feeling extremely resentful. I would also suggest couples therapy if you do decide on the second chance.",1556668919

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","As someone who played a decent amount of top Kench this past year, some of the points are either overblown, or wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;   he becomes a slow skarner: no mspd, has to hit 3 times to press W, can't even move enemies well, and QSS 

\&gt; hard counters devour. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is selling him a little short.  In teamfights with juggernauts/tank, Kench can realistically get his devour off multiple times with high CDR (especially now with, if the ""CD refund on enemies"" still acts the same)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  Thus his early game trading is worse both in damage and in mana 

&amp;#x200B;

This is ignoring the damage buff he got early from his passive getting flattened, and the mana reduction on his actual devour of the enemy champ.  His E also costs no mana either, which huge for him to not need to consider popping it in each auto trade for the extra shield bash damage.  His waveclear took a huge hit in all forms, but everything else is quite similar.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall there are some pretty brutal nerfs to some of his top lane damage (all of it on his W).  I've always run a W&gt;Q&gt;E skill order and that is unquestionable nerfed to the ground, but Q max first may have potential (longer range, stronger slow, faster base ms to rush the enemy), but he still seems worse late game in almost every way as a top laner.",1556668919

"therewasanattempt","t5_39ne7","Well that argument doesnt really hold up for long does it? I agree, masturbation isn't murder, but there is a distinction between masturbation and sex.

I would agree that a bundle of cells isn't murder either. But the cells that become a human we know become a human. We know exactly what those cells are doing, they may not quite be recognizable, but within a handful of weeks it will have every precursor of self aware life. Maybe it isn't there yet, but saying it isn't life is equivalent to looking at a child and assuming that child will never grow to an adult because it is a child now, therefore the child is worth nothing because children are worth nothing. Their worth lies in what they might do as adults in our society.

Obviously it's a parasite, you chose to have sex and risk this. It was very clear what you were doing, and the entire responsibility of having a child is that they live off you, as every other animal acts. Same as my parents, and yours. That is not a surprise nor an excuse to abort, at least not a good one. 

There is most certainly a line to be drawn, but it's difficult. The biggest issue is I believe people can't have this conversation like adults without bringing in major biases, and/or resorting to insulting or mania, as seen by most of the replies to my comment. It's filled with anger, with no desire for anybody to understand anybody else, or to even listen.",1556668920
"BostonU","t5_2s4to","Alright shit let's take a shot at this. CGS takes up your first two full years, and you are able to take 3 courses towards your major during this time.

Looks like that CS+Stats program is 18 total classes, making that a fat ass major. The calc requirement and CS111 requirement can be covered by your AP's, so make that 16 total courses. Since 3 of these courses can be taken during your time in CGS, at the start of your junior year, you're looking at 13 total courses remaining. 

[Business minor](https://www.bu.edu/academics/questrom/programs/minor-in-business-administration-management/) is 8 courses, but AP Micro/Macro will bring it down to 6. Add that to your 13 up there, that now makes 19 total courses at the start of junior year.

For argument's sake, let's say you take 0 summer courses to cover requirements. That means for your last two years you'll be taking 19/4 = an average of 5 courses per semester.

Now say that you successfully complete 3 courses worth of requirements over the summers. This should be a nice and very doable goal, because then that makes 16 courses/4 semesters = 4 courses per semester your last two years, a normal course load.

So that means yes, you theoretically *can* fit full Stats, full CS, and a biz minor in 4 years with CGS. However, this is all a perfect-case scenario. This means that you got all your AP credits, didn't fail a single class, didn't have any doubts or second thoughts about your majors, and managed to successfully take 4/5 *rigorous* STEM and business courses per semester during your last two years. Ask any BU student here and they'll tell you that that's a tall order. But, I wrote all this to give you the objective information, and also because I have nothing else to focus my attention on right now. Honestly though, that was a fun little write-up, not gonna lie. I should be an academic advisor.

Again, when you go through college you'll figure a lot out, and your mindset and goals will likely change. Pick a school to the best of your knowledge and live with the decision. Just enjoy your time there and get your degree, it honestly won't make a difference in the grand scheme of things.",1556668920

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You can definitely be sneaky. Many players play a sort of lurking style, cutting off rotations and backstabbing. Throwing down smokes to limit the opposing team's view is also very important, as well as sneakily walking through enemy smokes to catch them off guard. There's tons of boost areas too which many players don't know about.

Movement in this game is insane too. Can't climb anything? Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/MhrrRf7VaeU) posted just a few days ago. Movement in CS:GO has a ton of little things to it - just watch a pro like FalleN on train back in his prime.

Turn a corner and get headshot? You can jiggle peek. Shoulder peek. Flash them off. Molly them out of their position. Smoke them off. The game is a lot more than just peeking angles and clicking heads. Utility is huge in high-level CS:GO; there's a reason why teams like Astralis are so great on maps like Inferno. You'll get naded down to half your health before you can even see one of them. Conversely, you can nade them down. Mind games. Do I try to take map control and risk taking utility damage? Or do I give up map control, take somewhere else, and go back once the other team has used their utility/rotated?

I can't see how you can judge CS:GO this harshly with only 40 hours played; like u/itirate said, it's a lot more than clicking heads.",1556668920

Bahari, MBV, Tyler Jet would all be defunct in a few years after his tenure. His 1 win without aid of strategy or a restrictor plate is an argument that Johnny was a better racer in the same equipment. 

The 35 Tabasco car that Todd drive would end up becoming Tyler Jet, which Johnny nearly won the Daytona 500 in as well. 

I don’t think Johnny could’ve taken on Jeff and Dale but I think if Johnny had ended up someplace like RCR he would’ve won 10-15 races. Also keeping in mind Johnny didn’t get into Cup until he was 35ish. Johnnys biggest flaw was that he was too gentlemanly on the track.

&gt; &amp;quot;The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office&amp;#039;s work and conclusions,&amp;quot; Mueller wrote in the letter, according to the Post.

&gt; Mueller&amp;#039;s letter was reportedly sent on March 27, just days after Barr released a four-page letter laying out what he described as Mueller&amp;#039;s principal conclusions.

&gt; Barr told Congress earlier in April that he offer the special counsel the opportunity to review his four-page letter before releasing it but that Mueller declined.

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","Look into groupage or LCL, it's by far the cheapest. There are companies that specialise in it, and using those search terms you'll find them.

Also, as far as appliances go, I would not suggest you plan on that for anything more than a very temporary arrangement. You're not just dealing with a voltage change, but a frequency difference. Also, consider the starting compared to the running wattage. Even if you have a beefy transformer, you might still underestimate the needs - plus it will probably emit a low humming/buzzing noise. Not really something you want to deal with in your kitchen or living room.

Good luck, moving countries or continents is a big deal.

Edit: If using LCL, you have to allow for quite a bit of schedule lag. Send things way before you need to, because something always comes up, and then you're without your stuff for a month before you can start living normally again. Another reason not to rely on shipped appliances. But maybe that's part of the fun, right?",1556668923

According to GoNorthwest, the area has a population of around 15 million. Bump Reveal. estimates that 3,978,497 babies are born every year in the United States.

Using statistics from Bliss it is estimated that about 1 in 7 babies in the UK require a neonatal unit upon their birth. Assuming this statistic translates to the United States, this would mean that 568,365 need this treatment in the US yearly.

The United States has approximately 327.2m people living there, meaning that the Pacific Northwest holds approximately 4.5% of the US population, translating to 25,576 babies needing neonatal treatment in the area yearly.

Using Bliss's statistics again, it can be seen that the average stay in the neonatal clinic for a baby is one week. Considering there are 52 weeks in a year, this means that 1/52 of this figure are in the clinics at any one time.

This translates to 491 babies in the area where Sonic the Hedgehog immediately cuts complete power and life support to. Sonic is literally a mass baby murderer.

##Warmed by the Plains

Trec only brings out a little warmth though, Noah’s at his happiest around two certain Sacaens, so that’s next.


Noah and Fir decide to take a book out of Corrin’s book and decide that love is the best answer. Cavalry and Myrmidons should be friends, not foes. In conclusion: 

Peri and Hinata best ship.

Okay, but seriously, Noah’s supports with Fir are just him and her trying to convince themselves they’re not in love with the other for both of their own reasons. Noah ends up saying it though! Hooray! He’s in love! He’s able to open up the way Zelot and Juno always wanted. Also, I think it’s cute that members of Bartre’s family continue to find their loved ones in arenas. Bartre through getting his ass whooped, but I think Noah’s initial interest in Fir may come from the other Sacaen he supports. Someone who he knew was a Sacaen swordmaster and perhaps fought similarly. 

Fir’s uncle, Karel, is Noah’s reason for using the sword. You see, when Noah was a child, a brave Sacaen swordsman came through and slaughtered a group  of bandits that were attacking his hometown. Noah remembers this man was known as The Sword Saint. He simply saw the occurance as The Sword Saint protecting his village, and it is an unforgettable memory of his. It’s even the reason he has a C rank in swords instead of the E rank that every other cavalier starts with.

I think this is the one positive *thought* that Noah has aside from telling Fir that he loves her, and even this is surrounded by murder. Noah is educated on the truth of Karel’s past  in their A support, and he’s utterly floored. Karel tells him that good things are gone before you realize you had them, and I think that’s something that Noah knows personally. Once more, Noah is told to tell those he cares about how he feels before they’re gone for good. Otherwise his regret *will* follow him for sure. 

Also him calling Karel “Master Karel” is fantastic. Man’s not a commanding officer like General Zelot or Lady Juno, but he makes sure to put respect on his name. Kudos, Karel. Got your niece a boyfriend, *and* came off as one of the greatest figures in his life. 

These two Sacaen Swordsmen are the two that brought light to Noah’s past and future. His supports with them are great. 

______________________________

##Vagrant Knight

&gt;Wanting to test his ability, Noah left Zelot's group and traveled the world as a lone mercenary knight. Although several nations offered him positions in their militaries, he turned them all down. Many people have been inspired by his strength to live life by just being himself…

This ending is unchanging, but due to supports it can have multiple different takes to it. 

Noah becomes the strength that Karel once was for him. He’s no Sword Saint (I guess because he’s a knight), but the fact that he inspires so many people as a lone mercenary wandering around, sought out by all, means that he may very well deserve the title as Karel’s successor.

Of course… Fir becomes the next Sword Saint. She travels the world with her sword, and I see no reason why the two can’t try to change the world, meeting up to exchange stories, laugh about their adventures, and share time. “The Vagrant Knight and The Sword Saint”. Could be a pretty sick pair fighting for each other. (though I know he travels alone). Alternatively, his inability to dedicate himself to anyone because of his emotional hold ups could lead to a falling out, with both dedicating themselves to either get over the other or make themselves strong enough to not hold back the other.

Trec… Probably chilled with Noah a while longer,  but then Trec becomes Haar or something. What’s important is that Noah leaves Zelot’s group and travels on his own, leaving the possibility that the two may have to fight each other as they discussed.

Zelot and Juno give support and guidance to Noah, and I think their words can weigh heavy on him after he leaves. I think in this case he ends up giving in to the feelings that he holds. He’s a Mercenary Vulture of Ilia, alone in the world with nobody around him. Perhaps he comes to regret his own exploits similar to Karel. Who knows.

Perhaps he simply runs off on his own, refusing to get close to others in the end.


Another important thing to note is that Zelot could have set this man up for life. Zelot becomes the king of Ilia. Juno, Thea, and Shanna reform the pegasus knights, and when Juno retires to leave the battlefield, Thea becomes in charge. There’s no reason Zelot could not have put Noah in charge of the Mercenary troop he once led/the newfound Knights of Ilia, and it is in fact possible that Ilia is one of the countries that begged for Noah to join them.

___________________________


#Ilian Companion comparisons 

The cavalry and pegasus knights of Ilia are my favorite parallels in all of Fire Emblem.

##Other Ilians

Trec and Shanna are the most carefree of their group. Trec’s a little dimwitted and simple, and Shanna’s a little too energetic… and simple. Not sure if Trec’s the youngest of the three, though. They’re both pretty happy, if not out of ignorance than out of innocence. Noah makes even Trec look like a bundle of sunshine, but compared to these two, he seems to be a bit more of a thinker. 

Then you have Zelot and Juno. They’re a married couple and they’ve got a lot in common; they’re like the Clive and Mathilda of this game. I found their dynamic to be great, but this isn’t a discussion on them. Their happiness comes from experience and acceptance of their place in life as well as each other. They also seem to have more conviction in their thoughts and beliefs, and though Juno feels regret she still continues to believe in love and getting attached. Zelot continues to move forward even with grief. Noah on the other hand has his thinking come off as worrying.

##Noah’s Parallel


Finally, you have Thea. Thea’s super caring. She’s constantly trying to help others, and her family is her life. Trying to be caring and coddling to Shanna or cooking for and organizing Zelot and Juno’s wedding, this lady must have been the sweetest middle sister of any pegasus knight trio. She also cares about love. To the point that she sometimes seems like a shonen tsundere. Aside from Klein, Thea also has a connection with Alen. It’s not just camaraderie though, as she begins to mention the implications of such a pairing on the battlefield. Though this could be because of her feelings for Klein, the fact that she asks him “But I’m really alright for you?” says otherwise. 

She has 5 supports; each one focuses on her familial or romantic sides through her affectionate and caring personality because **in the end love is what drives her.** Absolutely every one of her supports has her trying to show love (Shanna/Klein/Alan) or being thanked for everything she’s done while trying to do more (Juno/Zelot).

Noah, in my opinion, has the potential to be her emotional equal. I think his dedication to closing himself off instead of trying to better and protect those important to him makes him Thea’s opposite in this case. The closest he comes to mimicking this behavior is with Fir, and he shows some concern for his buddies Grant and Sieks as well. He’s no Thea though, and he remains unable to wear his heart on his sleeve like she does. 

~~I hope that the two of them gain a support if they add any in an FE6 remake~~",1556668926

If they were advanced enough to be able to get ready completely on their own with only a wake-up service, they’d be mature and reliable enough that they should be able to wake up with an alarm instead of a live person rolling them onto the floor. 

There’s definitely going to be more involved. At a minimum, even if you’re not physically dressing them or preparing food, you’re going to have to be ‘nagging’ them.

This is really just not a good idea, for other reasons. I’m not sure why she thinks they’re any safer asking for a high schooler. The person who gets the gig has to come to her, meaning they saw the ad and proactively sought her out.

Sexual offenders do exist amongst high school age children. She needs to treat this with the same caution she would any other age respondent. Someone willing to take a pretty low wage for a disproportionate number of hours should invite scrutiny, not relief.

They were all wrong. See how unhealthy it is to try and force reality to match your strange beliefs? You end up being too loose with definitions and getting corrected by strangers on the internet.

&gt; Now how about the others? Do you remember them?

Lol are you honestly trying to suggest that I remember everyone you argue with? XD.

I brought up that guy because I replied in the thread to your silly assertion that science backs up your weird beliefs. 

&gt; Equating ""disagreement"" to being ""wrong"" is what you have been doing this whole time and think you are making corrections.

Your definitions are wrong. Utterly wrong. I haven't said anything about disagreement.

&gt; Proof is useless when the one receiving it rejects it because it does not align with his own views. 

So that's a NO to having proof then? XD

&gt; Again, more insight of your selfish mindset and not comprehending that asceticism is how you connect to the divine and everything that exists that enables us to act selflessly.

Prove the divine exists and the asceticism helps us connect to it. Like, if you can't provide proof, stop saying it lol.

&gt; That confirms it. You don't care about anyone else.

Lmao stop hiding behind other people. You are wrong. You should be corrected. That's how things work, buddy.

"cowboys","t5_2re7g","&gt; As long as we’re in agreement that Agholor shouldn’t be in the same conversation as any of these guys

For sure. Not even slightly a contest Edelman&gt;Agholor. Only reason I used Edelman is because he was a Super Bowl MVP, it doesn’t make him a better receiver than any of the other guys. 

&gt; Just to play devil’s advocate for a second though, can’t the same be said about OBJ and Eli/NY?

I have no problem admitting that OBJ is more talented as a receiver than Cooper. I simply said I wouldn’t trade Cooper for him. That’s coming from a perspective of knowing that Cooper fits our offense and our locker room, has chemistry with our QB, and isn’t a diva. It’s coming from an “if it ain’t broke don’t try to fix it,” perspective really. Even if I could get a statistically better receiver, I wouldn’t want to unless it was an absolute top tier player without any personality issues. As far as OBJ going to play with Baker, maybe he’s way better off there, or maybe he and Eli had a ton of chemistry that he and Baler struggle to recreate. OBJ was pretty much always Eli’s safety net and there was tons of trust there. I think OBJ is talented enough and happy enough to be there that it will work but you just don’t know till they get on the field together. The biggest concern for me with OBJ is that in his entire career he has played 16 games only once. Two of those were soft tissue injuries and those are the ones that get you the injury prone title.",1556668928
"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt; On August 2, 2016, nearly 120,000 BTC (worth about $75 million at the time) were hacked due to security flaws in Bitfinex’s website. To address the crisis, Bitfinex issued bond-like token BFX back then.

It’s been so long since this happened I nearly forgot about it. The article also says people are still being paid back from this. 

If they’re generating as much free cash flow as Zhao Dong claims how have people not been paid back yet? 

Anyone here have an update on that situation? How much is left to be paid back? How often do you get paid back anything? How much at a time?

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","1. What are Tyrion and the rest of the south supposed to do? Daenerys has two dragons (three at the time of the Tarly's execution) and two full armies that she's controlling. And I flat out disagree with the notion that Tyrion as a character HAD to do something even if he disagreed with the killing of the Tarly's. Followers questioning the decisions of their leader without acting is something that happens in real life. The consequences of Daenerys' actions are that people don't view her the same as they used to; Tyrion and Varys have lost some faith in her. We still haven't seen the end of her story either, so let's see how it plays out. 

2. The Waif was sent to kill Arya, and Arya fended her off, killing her in the process. Is she supposed to be penalized for surviving and fighting for her life? We saw the consequences of Arya's actions of killing Meryn Trant, they just didn't play out with Arya losing her life, it was the Waif. The Many-Faced God was repaid with a face. Furthermore, we've always known that Jaqen H'ghar is somewhat fond of Arya, so it's not out of character that he would allow her to leave. She completed her training.

3. The stories of Dorne, The Reach and The Stormlands were complete. And if you disagree with me, that's fine, but sometimes you have to sacrifice story for other story. There are only so many episodes in a season, and so many seasons of a show. I don't feel like I missed anything in those locations.

4. The people of the North realized that they needed the Wildlings on their side to fight the war, and Jon made this point numerous times after being questioned about it.

5. Tyrion's strategic blunders have been acknowledged by Dany, but again, the story isn't complete. She clearly thinks that he is still the best person for the job despite some errors in judgment, which she approved by the way, so it's not all on him.

6. Cersei is the clear next in line after Tommen's death. She's the blood of the former king and there's nobody else that could fill the role. She's also ruling with an iron fist, so people are scared of her. She has The Mountain by her side and just showed that she is capable and willing to kill a lot of people. Who's going to challenge that? The people of King's Landing so they can get wiped out by the Lannister Army? And you're right, I don't care at all that Kevan Lannister was killed and i'm glad no more time was spent on that. He was a worthless character.

7. The Dothraki charging into battle was meant to draw the Night King out so Dany and Jon could jump him with their dragons. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to win the war. Did it play out as intended? No. Was it the absolute optimal strategic decision? No. Jon and Dany aren't great war tacticians and they did make strafing runs over the horde of Wights, but Dany decided to pursue the NK and Jon went after her. Dany isn't a rational character, so this isn't a plot hole in my opinion.",1556668929

POGGERS has multiple meanings depending on who you watch.
POGGERS is a different form of PogChamp, which signifies something cool happens, a reaction almost or excitement.
However, when twitch went big, POGGERS was one of the emotes adopted by people who didn't really know  too much.
Now it represents something that is popular, or something normie (on some streams).
Ex: On let's say Ninja's stream, when something cool happens they go 'POGGERS'
Ex: On xqcOW's stream, they go 'FORTNITE POGGERS' to kind of show that it's normie.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I’m a woman and didn’t have a sex toy at 12 but given when I was raised, I was sexually repressed and didn’t really know that girls masturbating, I thought only boys did. I also likely didn’t masturbate because I couldn’t orgasm just by my hands, so I stopped trying. But once I was 17 and had my first orgasm with someone else, I bought a vibrator online without my parents knowing and have been masturbating regularly since, only with the use of a vibrator.  

HOWEVER, if I ever have kids, particularly girls, I certainly will do what your wife did and help my daughter by her first vibrator at an age which children typically start masturbating (like 12-14) and have an open and candid conversation with them about masturbating and what is healthy and what isn’t, and which vibrators can be used with which lube, etc. if I have boys, I would ensure my husband or the boys father have a similar conversation with him, but them lube and tissues and whatever else they may need, and talk to them  about the same types of things, what’s healthy and unhealthy, and about porn and what is realistic and what isn’t and to make sure they understand that porn is imaginary. Girls need this conversation too. I would ensure that my daughters knows that the conversations we have together are confidential and aren’t shared with my husband or her siblings (similar to conversations about puberty and mensuration), and I except the same to happen with my husband and my son, however we each need to know that these conversations are taking place so neither one is surprised. But I do understand why your wife hid it from you, she wanted her daughter to trust her and knew that you would react the way you did, but she probably should have gone about it in a different way. 

 You NEED to start early with these conversations and sex positivity because if you start too late, like 16 or 17, there’s a good chance your child has already started having sex and thinks they know everything already, these conversations need to start far earlier than you may think is appropriate for them to be effective. 

I teach high school sex Ed, mainly to freshmen, and by the time I get to the sex ed unit with my kiddos, who are an average age of 14, many of them are already sexual active and already think they know everything about sex And are unwilling to listen to me... 12 is NOT too early for a young woman to start exploring her body sexually, and it’s far better to be under the guidance of her mom than entirely on her own, possibly sticking things up her vagina and causing a yeast infection or never getting the opportunity to orgasm on her own and then jumping into sex far too early just for sexual gratification.

My advice to you is to give up the fight about your daughter owning a vibrator bought by her mother and start a conversation with your wife about being a team and making these decisions together. Realize that while you are your daughters parent, your wife is a woman and knows a bit more about female sexuality than you do and that you may be wrong on this one, but you BOTH should be discussing these things together privately before discussing them with your children. Your issue isn’t that your wife allowed your daughter to buy a vibratory to masturbate with, your issue is your communication with your wife, THATS what you need to work on.",1556668930

#Conclusion

Noah’s a troubled man who represents the worst thoughts of Ilia, and it shows. He’s pessimistic with a soft side, and he cares about everyone around him as distantly as possible. He does his job and does his best, but he’s not like Trec; he can’t be carefree. The pain of losing his loved ones is too much, and so he needs to be opened up by others. His superiors encourage him to show more, but he can’t bring himself to. The war, and Ilia’s way of life, has made him apprehensive and unsure. In the end, he probably can’t figure out the right path. He can’t stop moving though, and so he’ll do whatever it takes to get through.



He also serves as the counterpart to Thea because of this; the love and compassion that he wants to show has been frozen over by the cold wastes of Ilia. Man can’t even express emotion towards the woman he fell in love with at first sight because of his expectations on the outcome. He hesitates to show that same care and concern to others, even though he expresses interest in the wellbeing of others. Whereas Thea goes above and beyond to be that warmth for other people. She does what he can’t, openly expressing her emotions and affection to everyone she meets.

I think his ending is him running away from his emotions even further, personally. I believe it to be him trying to become strong enough if only because he feels too weak to keep those he cares about safe.
______________________

#TLDR


Zelot, Noah, and Trec better have a triangle attack in the FE6 remake, IS. I don’t care how broken it might be getting it that early. Make it weaker or some shit. Though perhaps it’s because Noah and Trec are too distant from Zelot compared to the peg sisters that it doesn’t happen. Either way, I love this Brady Bunch of Ilians, The depressed Cavaliers that are kinda closed off, and the more optimistic peg knights that openly express worry and care for each other. Perhaps there’s a reason that the Pegasi won’t let men ride them… Either way, Noah’s my favorite of them all.
____________________________________________________________


**PS**: After looking at Ilians for the past 2 days, I think Roy’s Blue and White skin in Melee is actually an Ilian armor scheme. 


**PSS**: As a unit, Noah’s just another cav. His start won’t be as great as Alance, but his weapon ranks and con really make him a great asset. Instant Steel/Killing weapons while only losing 1 AS from Javelins and no AS from Steel Swords makes him very effective. Especially because grinding up the Christmas Cavs’ sword ranks may be difficult if unfocused. His growths are average, but his bases are pretty clean. He joins before the Western Isles, so it’ll be a good opportunity to get him some levels before promotion. Especially if one decides not to give him the first Knight’s Crest.

Post promotion, he can use hand axes without losing AS (Helps a little against lance users), as well as Iron Blades, though 1 AS loss compared to Alance isn’t something super notable.",1556668930

"StoriesAboutKevin","t5_32fvc","If you're certified, a lot of liveaboard places will be fairly chill.  Did one in Thailand (Similan Islands), and it was f'n amazing.  Fairly easy if you were open water certified.

Komodo is by far the hardest diving I've ever done.  It was INSANE, crazy currents, little to no rock holds during those swirling currents, and crazy drops to get to the dive site.  

Other than that, I'd say the only thing to worry about on a liveaboard is if you get seasick, and you probably wouldn't be a diver if you were.  Also, you can't be too picky about food, because you eat what they serve.

BOOK ONE!!!!!!! It's amazing! usually up around 5-6, breakfast and in the water around 7, do 3-4 dives and then pop a beer and go to bed, and repeat.


The Thailand one my sister and I did was 6 days 5 nights, so that can be a bit long.  The boat had rooms, and small beds.  Whereas the Komodo one basically had lay out mats which were comfy enough, but after a couple days, it got rough since I'm a side sleeper.  Still, one of the best experiences of my life.  DO ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!


edit: the Komodo one specifically tells you that you need to have advanced cert before diving.  So most places will tell you what you need certification wise, whether they allow nitrox dives, etc. etc.",1556668932

Also 10 teams with Bo2s would make things super weird. The only way to not make absurdly long broadcasts is to have 2.5 bo2s every week where 1 match each week is actually finished the next week.

*****
&gt; We&amp;#039;re broadcasting from Washington, D.C. In breaking news, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&amp;oacute; says a coup is underway in Caracas.

&gt; Guaid&amp;oacute; appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L&amp;oacute;pez, who said he had been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition.

&gt; Venezuela&amp;#039;s Socialist Party leader called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend President Nicol&amp;aacute;s Maduro against what he called a &amp;quot;Small uprising of traitorous [military] soldiers backed by the U.S.&amp;quot; Venezuela&amp;#039;s defense minister said the Maduro government remains in control and that military units reported normality at barracks and bases across Venezuela.

Here are the, you might need to be paid situations:


1. The extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee—and vice versa.
1. The extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment, including the clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions.
1. The extent to which the internship is tied to the intern’s formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic credit.
1. The extent to which the internship accommodates the intern’s academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar.
1. The extent to which the internship’s duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning.
1. **The extent to which the intern’s work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.**
1.  The extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship.

Not sure how having one chapter and dying is a metric for intelligence?

&gt;She makes those blunders because she's losing her mind. I don't know how you missed that. That's why we have Cersei's POV in that book, to see her descent into madness.

Saying that she is ""losing her mind"" is a gross exaggeration. Cersei is paranoid about prophecy after Joffrey's death and that's it. She is not exactly mad in a medical sense. And Cersei was always stupid, from the very beginning. It wasn't as apparent initially because there was always someone who had her under control - Robert, Tyrion, Tywin. The only time before Tywin's death when she was in charge was shortly after Ned's death and Tywin was so appalled at how the things were handled, he quickly sent Tyrion to take charge instead.

&gt;Also, Cersei makes similar blunders in the show. Like legitimizing and militarizing the sparrows.

Yes, because the showwriters wanted to adapt that storyline.

&gt;Cersei in the books also organizes the downfall of Margaery. In the show, she doesn't really do shit to bring down Margaery. Instead a male whore does it in the most convoluted way.

She tried to organise Margaery's downfall, what she did organise was in fact her own downfall as she fell into the very trap she herself created for Margaery. While Margaery is about to go free relatively untouched and the Tyrells took over KL. All because of Cersei's ""plan"".",1556668938

"news","t5_2qh3l","Why didn’t I buy a home in Boston Edison? What you mean is you have no fucking clue how property taxes in the city work. Those 5k houses were gutted ruins that needed 50k+ in Reno and would cost 20k a year in taxes even after 2008’s NEZ.

I personally, like a lot of people with credit, wasn’t looking for the utter gamble of property spec and being a shitty slum lord - but was invested in an actual business.

Detroit’s property taxes did not go by market value, they went by city appraised value - which was often time 10x the market value, or more, especially in BE or Indian Village.

I grew up in Warrendale and lived in various neighborhoods my entire life save a stint as a teenager and my time in Iraq. I’ve lived everywhere from SW to Delray to the East Side to Downtown and even in the end, around Eastern Market - where some friends owned a building and when they rejected a low ball price from out of state investors they started hammering us with inspectors until they were forced to sell due to code violation fines for dumb, bureaucratic shit.

Do you think people in Detroit 15 years ago just had the money and credit to engage in housing speculation - or compete with outside money that came flooding in after 2008? Everyone was trying to hold on to what they had left. This comment is astoundingly divorced from reality. Bizzaro world shit.

https://prospect.org/article/destruction-black-wealth

Up until 2011, when I left, the proceeding years were not ripe with opportunity - they were a desperate struggle. “Why didn’t you just get a bumch of lines of credit to buy a bunch of 
dilapidated assets you have no assurance will ever actually mature while paying obscene taxes - in the midst of a housing bubble, or the intervening catastrophe following”. How shit, what?

No, you didn’t “support Detroit” by sticking a D on the back of your car, coming down for DEMF or to stumble back to the MGM lot after getting blotto at McShanes or Greektown from OLdS. You were engaging in commerce, trade - that’s it.

No I would not live on the east side again. Why would I? My people are all gone. The connections, friends, family, business partners - two decades worth of social capital scattered to the wind.

I left to another city to go to university and stayed abouts. I make sure to not clean up my neighborhood TOO much, not to make the bus stops TOO much, because it’s all that’s keeping a 5 guys off my corner and a Dan Gilbert from realizing we’re conveniently close to downtown. I may own my house now, but a lot my neighbors don’t - and I recognize that a city is people, not a just a place for people to come play in once in a while.

And for real, I used to walk all the way down Grand River from E. Grand to the Leland on Friday’s/Saturday’s and never had a problem -   Corktown was never even that bad, and far better than tons of areas further from downtown including the one I lived in. You just couldn’t walk around drunk and clueless. That’s it.

Do yourself a favor and go read some Community Economic Development from any Uni if you actually desire to have an informed opinion - MSU has plenty of good, empirical, work. Gentrification became such a commonly dirty word because of how intensely all of
the CED work pushes against it because it stunts or destroys actual long term economic development.",1556668938

You can find a useful chart that might help you wrap your head around the concept [at this link.](https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/) 

Asking about pronouns is really a damned if you do/damned if you don't situation, because even trans people are really divided on that. Some people prefer to be asked, particularly those who use something other than he or she. Some people are hurt by the implication they may not pass, or feel like it's undue pressure to out themselves. 

One way to get around it is to volunteer that you use she/her when you introduce yourself (at least, I'm going to assume you do since you identify as cis.) Then the other person will likely feel more comfortable doing the same. 

Using they/them in cases where pronouns are unknown is fine. But if someone asks for something else, respect that.",1556668939

&gt; We&amp;#039;re broadcasting from Washington, D.C. In breaking news, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&amp;oacute; says a coup is underway in Caracas.

&gt; Guaid&amp;oacute; appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L&amp;oacute;pez, who said he had been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition.

&gt; Venezuela&amp;#039;s Socialist Party leader called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend President Nicol&amp;aacute;s Maduro against what he called a &amp;quot;Small uprising of traitorous [military] soldiers backed by the U.S.&amp;quot; Venezuela&amp;#039;s defense minister said the Maduro government remains in control and that military units reported normality at barracks and bases across Venezuela.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","People who get it recognize the argument is far stronger for ordinal scaled measurements rather than interval or ratio(""continuous"").

My guess is your advisor is not someone with a strong background in statistics and you were taught by someone with a background similar to your advisors where they have learn to use some methods but not really what underpins the choice of methodology and therefore, don't necessarily see the differences to understand ""reasonable"" and ""wrong"". 

For any data type to be greater than ordinal, it should at least be reasonable to say that differences between categories should be the same across the scale and across experimental/observational units. This means that the arbitrary assignment of 1=disagree totally, 2= disagree somewhat, ...,4=agree somewhat, 5=agree totally should have: the same meaning for changing disagree totally (1) to disagree somewhat (2) as when you change from agree somewhat (4) to agree totally (5) AND this same ""1 point"" change should also be the same irrespective of the person you choose. Clearly, this is a baseless argument to say that changing from ""1"" to ""2"" is the same as ""4"" to ""5"" in the scale and across people.

Most people don't take the time to look through 5 different subs about the same game as they just find the most populated sub and then they're good. This is why POTG videos are liked like crazy on the main sub instead of on one of the potg only subs. People (especially new people/not technologically inclined) follow where the largest groups are typically. So having one sub at 20mil posting all of the above, one at 9k posting workshop and custom games, another two at 2k posting workshop games, and another at 20 posting workshop videos. Yeah, this splits the community unnecessarily. And on another note, the more concentrated the fan base is in one (or in this case two) places, the more traction a sub can get allowing it to get the attention of Blizzard. So there's no point posting suggestions or bugs or anything to a crowd of a few hundred since it would never garner any attention. 

Lastly, all the mods need to do is give workshop posts a flair so people can filter it out if they want. That solves the whole issue about not wanting to see the videos in your feed.",1556668940

&gt; El secretario general de la [UTA](http://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/titular-de-la-uta-nos-estan-matando-como-perros.phtml), **Roberto Fernández**, confirmó que “mientras que el Gobierno no nos llame y encontremos la solución al [impuesto a las Ganancias](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/hubo-quorum-pero-la-oposicion-no-pudo-tratar-ganancias-y-tarifas.phtml) nosotros todos los feriados, **a partir del 1 de mayo, nos lo vamos a tomar**” y ""**va a haber paro de transporte"".**
&gt; 
&gt; “El poder adquisitivo lo estamos perdiendo y vamos a perder trabajadores. Porque nosotros, al reducir servicio, hay menos coches y más **trabajadores sin trabajo**. Si no trabajamos la empresa no lo va a pagar”, detalló Fernández en diálogo con _Futurock_.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Además, denunció que las empresas amenazan con suspensiones a los trabajadores y retrucó: “Nosotros no lo vamos a permitir”.
&gt; 
&gt; “Empezamos a tomar estas precauciones porque el Gobierno no le encuentra solución a este problema económico. **Nos gustaría que el Gobierno nos llame mañana mismo**, nos sentemos y aclaremos la situación”, agregó.
&gt; 
&gt; [Anuncian un paro de transporte para el feriado 1 de mayo](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/feriado-01-mayo-2019-paro-transporte.phtml)
&gt; 
&gt; Por su parte, la CATT anunció este martes 9 de abril que no se prestará servicio el 1° de mayo ""en conmemoración de los Mártires de Chicago"", en referencia a la masacre que sufrieron en 1886 los trabajadores que reclamaban la jornada laboral de 8 horas en Estados Unidos, motivo por el cual se conmemora el feriado. La medida se debe al reclamo de la r**eformulación del impuesto a las Ganancia**s sobre los salarios y un inmediato incremento salarial de emergencia a los jubilados.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tal cual anticipó en distintas reuniones con funcionarios de Gobierno, el Consejo Directivo de la [\#CATT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CATT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ha resuelto no prestar servicio el [\#1deMayo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/1deMayo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) en conmemoración de Mártires de Chicago.  
&gt; &gt; La [\#CATT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CATT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) viene reclamando por impuestos al [\#Trabajo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trabajo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) y aumento de emergencia a [\#jubilados](https://twitter.com/hashtag/jubilados?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; — CATT - Prensa (@CATT\_Prensa) [April 9, 2019](https://twitter.com/CATT_Prensa/status/1115726323350167552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
&gt; 
&gt; “Tal cual anticipó en distintas reuniones con funcionarios de Gobierno, el Consejo Directivo de la CATT ha resuelto **no prestar servicio el 1 de Mayo** en conmemoración de Mártires de Chicago. La CATT viene reclamando por impuestos al Trabajo y aumento de emergencia a jubilados”, expresaron en su cuenta de [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CATT_Prensa).
&gt; 
&gt; De esta forma, el miércoles 1° de mayo no funcionarán trenes, colectivos, subterráneos, barcos y aviones comerciales.
&gt; 
&gt; Por otro lado, Fernández [se animó a opinar del destino del peronismo](http://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/el-jefe-de-uta-justifico-el-paro-de-colectivos-un-poco-de-presion-tenes-que-hacer.phtml) para las próximas elecciones y, en ese sentido, exigió a los dirigentes “adoctrinarse” para conseguir la unidad. En ese sentido, expresó ""el deseo mayor” es lograr que se junten [**Cristina Fernández**, **Sergio Massa** y **Roberto Lavagna** y “ayudar al que gane la interna""](http://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/roberto-lavagna-dijo-no-hay-dudas-sobre-candidatura-presidente-pero-si-no-hay-consenso-no-me-interesa.phtml).

From what I can tell in the US there hasn't been a death from the measles in quite some time.  I think the last one was almost a decade ago, which doesn't fit the current hysteria, so its likely not made readily available.  

From what I can tell and my own grandparents reports the measles was viewed much like the chicken pox, as a non issue that didn't require a doctor's visit.  In fact, they often had measles parties, or chicken pox parties.  I can also see from an episode of the Brady Bunch that the measles was a non issue not very long ago.  

I mean if it were such a deadly disease wouldn't one of the most popular TV shows in America have a different stance and or have seen some push back?

To me, there is something not quite right about the current vaccine hysteria.  The real problem is that this debate has been really polarized, your either 100% support of all vaccines or your 100% against them.  To me these are both very ignorant points of view.  The truth is there are side effects to all medicine, certain people react differently to everything.  Vaccines have real side effects, especially certain ones.  There are more than 1 form of most vaccines and it would make sense to do research, preform allergy patch tests in addition to Titer tests before administering any medication.

But alas this kind of rational approach doesn't seem to gain any traction.",1556668942

&gt; We&amp;#039;re broadcasting from Washington, D.C. In breaking news, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&amp;oacute; says a coup is underway in Caracas.

&gt; Guaid&amp;oacute; appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L&amp;oacute;pez, who said he had been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition.

&gt; Venezuela&amp;#039;s Socialist Party leader called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend President Nicol&amp;aacute;s Maduro against what he called a &amp;quot;Small uprising of traitorous [military] soldiers backed by the U.S.&amp;quot; Venezuela&amp;#039;s defense minister said the Maduro government remains in control and that military units reported normality at barracks and bases across Venezuela.

Posting code without indenting it with 4 spaces, and saying the problem is

is a good way to not get help.

In general, to get help do the exact opposite: indent code with 4 spaces, describe and best document what the problem is.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NAH I might not be the most qualified to say this but then again you are asking this on Reddit. I feel you should be allowed to feel this way about seeing your daughter looking at these kind of things but I don't think you approached the situation in the best way, maybe talking to her and getting some woman's insight from your wife may have resulted in a better outcome. Although your wife has a valid point in trying to help along a healthy sex life she shouldn't have undermined your parental authority like that in front of your daughter. You should talk to your wife in private about respecting each other's authority as well as talk to your daughter together in order to help her and work out some understanding among the three of you. I know it may be uncomfortable to talk about these things but it's better than having your daughter grow up thinking sex is a bad thing that shouldn't be thought of or even becoming rebellious and doing things she really shouldn't.

I was one of those kids who were probably just one more beating, one more embarrassment, one more terrifying day away from finding a weapon. Hell, I'm 50 years old and I still haven't been able to put these issues to bed. We just had our 30 class reunion and I haven't attended a single one because no one knew much about me other than I was the punching bag for the bullies.

I had this talk with my registrar last year and they told me that a program coordinator realistically has the power to reject anyone they want even if it is a type 1 program for any reason, but I really don't think it's common and it was just to keep me aware that it's a possibility.

"technology","t5_2qh16","AC is a little more efficient in electric cars.  Both EV and ICE cars use a/c compressors and have the same power requirements, but ICE cars drive the compressor with a belt and that comes with an energy and power loss.

Heat is much more efficient in gasoline cars.  Heat exchange from combustion is used to heat the air in the cabin.  In electric cars, you have what is essentially an electric space heater, and like all electric space heaters, the power draw is really high.

Charging devices and other electronics should also be considered.  Alternators are only about 20% efficient.  Lithium ion batteries are &gt; 90% efficient.  Nvidia's 500W Pegasus AI chip will hit gasoline cars with a measurable decrease in mileage.  The best AI chip available today will consume about 1/13th of a gallon per hour.

Highly recommend studying that by watching lectures + doing provided HW/recitation problems, 313 isn't that bad and iirc reading Oppenheim was like pulling teeth. At least, for my 313 section, tests are based off the HW and there's only a few textbook problems sprinkled in, and you won't know which ones are which, so you won't be very efficient.

422C is just java, fairly easy to self study. 340L is linear algebra, so just going through Khan Academy / 3Blue1Brown should also suffice.

2229 = hours worked at min wage

7.25 = min wage.

16k = 2229 x 7.25

My contention was that real cost for public uni is 4k. hence

4k = (hours required) x 7.25

Or in other words,

4k = (hours worked) x 7.25 
(hours worked) = ~560 hours

BUT shorthand is to just divide THEIR hours by four because I think they overestimated tuition and fees by a factor of four:

16/4 = 2229/4 x 7.25
or 2229/4 = ~560.

Just to clarify the wording of this, it's not PRAW's fault. There are *no* supported ways of getting historical posts on reddit's own api anymore. That's the problem. When they changed their search backend, they didn't make this kind of feature accessible. Pushshift data is more than excellent, but it's sad that we have to go 3rd-party for this.

*****
&gt; We&amp;#039;re broadcasting from Washington, D.C. In breaking news, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&amp;oacute; says a coup is underway in Caracas.

&gt; Guaid&amp;oacute; appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L&amp;oacute;pez, who said he had been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition.

&gt; Venezuela&amp;#039;s Socialist Party leader called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend President Nicol&amp;aacute;s Maduro against what he called a &amp;quot;Small uprising of traitorous [military] soldiers backed by the U.S.&amp;quot; Venezuela&amp;#039;s defense minister said the Maduro government remains in control and that military units reported normality at barracks and bases across Venezuela.

"apexlegends","t5_rgzzt","I think you are getting fair and competitive mixed up. Luck is just in everything. In unreal tournament and quake its basically a quest to dominate the power up rotation once you get a good gun also its a case of spawning near a good gun, getting to the power ups first etc. Fighting games its a case of guessing the right frame and the right counter at the right time. its a lot harder than it sounds but man have I beat people way better than me by having them not be able guess my mix ups and flow charts and being able to read their current strategy then i win quit, I have also lost to people way worse than me pressing random ass buttons because somehow them not following the game rules works and and I just happened to start off with a combo with enough frames to be countered. Like using a different move I coulda won its rock, paper, scissors with more options but luck is still very much there. Titan fall 2 A good team thats balanced out can get fucked up if the worse team has 2 really good players distributing the damage just between them getting their titans out first and changing the game tide. Hell in real life competition luck exists. If I could remove luck from the equation of mma and video games I would....Scratch that just remove it it when luck works against me. There is just no such thing as fair. Luck is always random and always a huge influence over everything. Like if you were able to have every competition where the competitors were close in skill through out history play out a 100 different times who knows how the result would be each time. I bet they wouldn't be the same each time. Also fighting games are the most fair games on this planet and the least played. It almost like people don't like something thats fair and hitting a wall when ranking up or consistently getting their ass beat 1 on 1 by someone better once they reach a certain rank.",1556668945

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I tell this to all my friends - write it out. Your emotions and feelings don’t come out as some sensical narrative like in a movie. Spend some time with your thoughts and engage with your feelings and why you are feeling them. 

Write it out as a letter to the person you want to talks to. Or maybe as an outline for yourself. The more often you do this the better you will get at identifying behavior patterns and thought patterns. Soon you’ll be able to just organize the thoughts in your head, but you can’t demand that of yourself right off the bat. That’s being unfair to you - give yourself a break!

If you were nervous about a school assignment the best thing to do is prepare and study and practice. The same is true here. I would imagine part of your anxiety is about being understood correctly. 

You are allowed to ask for a moment to gather your thoughts if you are in an argument with someone. Take a breath.

Also, don’t be afraid to cry. It is nothing to be ashamed of. Your emotions aren’t the enemy.

"Insurance","t5_2qs6s","&gt;Rule 5: When all else fails, just stay quiet. Sometimes just letting the customer vent for a minute or two is all they need. 

My personal favorite. Let them burn themselves out. When the line falls quiet, wait. Bask in the silence. They're upset, let them be. 

&gt;Rule 4: Study insurance as much as you can.

Huge. Remember, we sell a contract, it is our duty to stand by that contract. Knowing that contract inside and out will be your best friend, and biggest career changer. When I have an employee ask a claims or coverage question, my first question is always, ""have you read the policy"", ""what's your interpretation"", ""what language are we reviewing"", etc. There is no rebuttal when you're able to refer to the mutually agreed upon contract.

Edit: Also if your company allows it, don't be afraid to hang up on claimants that aren't treating you like a human being. It doesn't happen all that often, but we're not in the business of being verbally abused. ""Sir if you continue to swear at me we're going to end this conversation, and we can pick up after you've had a moment to calm down"", cue ""MOTHERFUCKER"", and cut the line.

I love how you tried to squeeze your nipples but they were too slippery.. i really wonder how you would sound and moan when you get ahold of them. I really love to imagine the mixture of pain and hornyness you'd make.

I loved how naughty you were when you admitted to watch you like a whoe fingering herself... and then the loud squishy noised that sounded like you had a big dildo or your fingers in your mouth, made me really think of other things being in your mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

mmm, and when you edge yourself, talking so naughty.. i really have to restrain myself now from not cumming yet.

And i'd actually love to be there to spread that extra oil on your tits, that awesome squishy noised... must feel amazing to spread that oil all over your body, getting so slippery, messy and slutty.

Also since it is out of the flightline can maybe be built up? 

 Being as this is actually feasible, this is one of the more exciting future developments i'm aware of near DT, since I dont really care about manchester.

NDIA/AFCEA/WID/EDC member:
 As you may be aware, SPAWAR leadership is exploring options to partner with a private development agency to build modern headquarters for SPAWAR and commercial development on the existing Old Town Campus. Among the issues that will determine the success of this effort is the likelihood of SPAWAR's current or potential contractors and suppliers to utilize this commercial development. Accordingly, our organizations have joined together to conduct a survey of current and potential SPAWAR contractors and suppliers regarding the desirability of commercial space near the new SPAWAR headquarters. This survey is being distributed randomly via email. Should you and your company be asked to participate in the survey, we strongly encourage you to respond to it so that our voice as the local defense industry can be included in plans for the new Old Town site.",1556668947

When playing a new god, you are going through the same learning process others have gone through on older gods, just in the past. By your logic, once you learn the new god, you will trash the older god because your numbers are higher.

The difference in comfort with a God is very important. For example, I understand how Ares is supposed to work and have played him a little bit - however, I've played Xing a hella lot more and perform better on him. It is the fundamental reason why people select the gods they select - they like them more/feel them more than other alternatives.",1556668947

"Voltron","t5_2sl4q","Thanks for the link. I... am still not a fan of this being considered a trope. And I especially hate that it's diluting the very serious issue of how women in particular are treated within action-adventure stories by acting that this kind of thing happens to all kinds of characters. But... it's the internet. And I'm swerving off topic... To bring it back to the subject at hand:

&gt;The scale is different for Shiro because he's a main character, having a lover man or woman who is introduced only to die off-screen in an attempt to tug on the audiences heart strings is dumb. It doesn't matter if he's gay or not. His sexuality is irrelevant to how dumb that plot point is.

I'm seeing why we both feel we're beating our heads against a wall. We're arguing over completely different things. I am talking solely about Shiro as a gay character. That's the forward momentum I'm celebrating. 

From this quote it looks like you're more looking at the romantic story line: that the only thing close to an onscreen gay romance ends especially badly with the love interest killed in battle. (Actually -- if you were going to use a trope label, I'd say, ""bury your gays,"" might apply here specifically for Adam.)

I would never try and claim that VLD told a good gay romantic storyline. They most definitely did not. That's why I described it as, ""seat of the pants,"" in my original comment. The scene introducing Adam borders enough on vague that people felt they could deny it meant Shiro was queer. Then Adam ended up dying, which... not a great look. And when Shiro does get a wedding and a kiss at the end, it's to a guy he barely interacts with and who the audience doesn't really know. 

However, despite that hot mess, Shiro is still unambiguously gay and he's happy and he's living a full life that includes romance. That's the step forward I'm celebrating. Hopefully the next action-adventure cartoon will be able to take that step a whole lot further. 

&gt;It's there not to enrich the characters but for the writers to show off how progressive they are and pat themselves on the back.

I know this is the popular fandom narrative. It's not backed up by fact. Is contradicted by fact, actually.",1556668947

Very lovely bittersweet scene. Violet's question seems to make the former army commander question whether he should be learning to forgive himself the same way he's asking her to forgive herself. It's a great example of this show's dynamic, where Violet on her journey towards knowing and forgiving herself inadvertently helps others around her come to terms with their emotions through her unfiltered sincerity. Or at least that's my take on it! I can't express how much I loved this show.",1556668947

"ShingekiNoKyojin","t5_2we2n","&gt; but it doesn't explain how Zeke knew that Eren didn't didn't partner up with another royal family member to fulfill this condition

Well Zeke didn't know that, but he did know that no other royal family member in the walls could be one of the 9 Titans, because there were not available titans left. Zeke probably suspected about Historia for what Reiner and Bertolt told him; but in any case, even without Historia, Zeke probably considered Eren knowing someone else of royal blood inside the walls. That being said, that wouldn't be a problem, because he knew Eren had to come in contact not just with a royal blood individual, but with a **Titan** of royal blood. He knew Eren had the Founding Titan and the Attack Titan, or at least, that was his most likely assumption as we got [his thought process in chapter 115](http://217.23.10.62/manga/Shingeki-No-Kyojin/0115-011.png). But out of the remaining 7 Titans, 6 were in Marley's prossession (Beast, Armored, Colossal and Cart were in Shiganshina waiting for them; Jaws was whether imprisoned in the ships or in Marley; and Warhammer was in Marley). The only one that could have been fed to a royal blood person was the Female Titan... I guess that was Zeke's gamble, that Annie was either fugitive of Paradis forces or she latched herself inside a hardened shell as it happened. [Judging by Zeke's words, he believed in the former one.](https://i.imgur.com/TEGr7zq.jpg)

There's also the possibility that the Survey Corps turned a royal blood member into a Pure Titan and carried it to Shiganshina so Eren could activate his powers, but probably that seemed to far fetched for Zeke to consider it. And it would have been far fetched, considering the logistics to carry a restrained Pure Titan from Trost to Shiganshina in one night.

Edit:

&gt; (Then again I dunno why they limited themselves to titans when they could've just brought some army from the outside to shoot down the Survey Corp)

About this one, remember Zeke has second intentions. And among those is ""saving"" Eren. So if Marleyan soldiers offered their help to exterminate the Survey Corps, Zeke, as the warchief of the Warrior unit, probably told them to fuck off or politely convinced them to stay by the coast. We know now that Zeke wanted to convince Eren of his plan, so I don't know how Zeke's ideal outcome for the Shiganshina battle was, but it certainly wasn't eating or killing Eren. A Marleyan army could have killed Eren or restrained him and carried him right in front of the Tyburs where Eren would probably be killed, which Zeke didn't want.",1556668947

 Os bloqueios colocam em risco o funcionamento mínimo das instituições, como fornecimento de energia e água. A decisão refere-se repasses do Tesouro com gastos discricionários, sem envolver salários, e atinge cerca de R$ 120 milhões dos orçamentos das federais de Brasília, da Bahia e Fluminense. A assistência estudantil fica de fora do corte e desse cálculo.

 Todas as universidades federais têm enfrentado contingenciamento nos últimos anos para atingir a meta fiscal do governo. Até agora, esse bloqueio no geral tem representado cerca de 20% do custeio anual. O que havia sido sinalizado também para este ano.

 O MEC confirmou o bloqueio nessas universidades mas não disse qual o critério para esses casos. À noite, encaminhou outra nota defendendo que o critério para o bloqueio foi ""técnico e isonômico"" e pode ser revisto caso a reforma da previdência seja aprovada e a economia melhore. 

 O ministro, Abraham Weintraub, indicou ao jornal O Estado de S.Paulo que se trata de uma retaliação a atividades políticas, que classificou de ""balbúrdia"", “bagunça e evento ridículo”. 

 Como exemplo, falou sobre a presença de sem-terra e “gente pelada dentro”. Ainda alegou que essas federais teriam fracos resultados, o que é desmentido pelos indicadores.

 A iniciativa fere princípios constitucionais como autonomia universitária e a impessoalidade, segundo especialistas.""A autonomia universitária é didática mas também administrativa e de gestão financeira e patrimonial.

 O ministro está decidindo por conta própria qual padrão as universidades devem seguir"", diz a professora de direito da USP Rina Nanieri. ""Para isso é que existe autonomia, para que as instituições não fiquem à mercê do governante de plantão"". A Constituição prevê como princípio da educação a liberdade de ""divulgar o pensamento, a arte e o saber"".

 A Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação define a responsabilidade da União em assegurar os recursos suficientes para manutenção das instituições de educação superior por ela mantidas. O corte atinge, em sua maioria, a rubrica de custeio, que inclui segurança, energia e fornecimento de água.

 Na Unb, representa R$ 38,2 milhões, na UFBA, R$ 37,3 milhões e na UFF, R$ 44 milhões, segundo informações das instituições. O professor de direito administrativo Adib Kassouf Sad, da CEU Law School, diz que decisões administrativas por desvio de finalidade, por exemplo, podem ser tomadas, mas não de forma subjetiva. ""Isso só pode ocorrer por decisão fundamentada, não por entendimento pessoal do ministro"", diz. ""Se há suspeita de desvio de finalidade, deve ser apurado com processo e partir para responsabilização"".

 A UFF foi palco, em 2018, de ato contra o fascismo na campanha eleitoral e a UFBA recebeu o Fórum Social Mundial. Já a UnB sediou recentes debates com Fernando Haddad (PT) e Guilherme Boulos (PSOL).

 Segundo a plataforma de produção acadêmica Web of Science, as três estão entre as 11 instituições brasileiras que mais ampliaram o número de artigos de 2008 a 2017.

 Na última edição do RUF (Ranking Universitário Folha), ficaram entre as 20 melhores. Segundo o reitor da UFBA, João Carlos Salles, a universidade é espaço de produção de conhecimento, com discussões com setores da sociedade. “Isso faz parte do ambiente democrático da universidade. Não posso aceitar que possa ser designado como balbúrdia. Nosso desempenho acadêmico pode ser comprovado nos indicadores"".

 Em nota, UnB e UFF defenderam seus resultados e informaram que trabalham para reverter o bloqueio. 

 Reinaldo Centoducatte, da Andifes (que reúne reitores das federais), diz que os cortes específicos não têm justificativa plausível. ""Associar o bloqueio à perda de qualidade não tem respaldo. Se por acaso o MEC perceber a perda de qualidade na nossa atividade, tem que ser apontada, analisada, determinar causas e, a partir daí, achar soluções.""

 Esses cortes fazem parte de um grande contingenciamento anunciado pelo governo, de R$ 30 bilhões. Do total, R$ 5,8 bilhões são do MEC.

 Em entrevista à Rádio Gaúcha, o reitor da UFRGS, Rui Vicente Oppermann, disse que “gente pelada, só se for de salário”, em reação à fala do ministro. O tema repercutiu no Congresso.

 O deputado Bacelar (Pode-BA) vai convocar o ministro para se explicar na Câmara. O líder da oposição, Alessandro Molon (PSB-RJ) prometeu acionar o STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal), que no ano passado garantiu livre manifestação de ideias em universidades.",1556668949

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","The ""legal website"" (aka advertisement for a law firm) you linked misspelled the name of the appellant in the only case they cite, which is from 1970 and actually doesn't address the issue at all. They claim the Georgia Appeals Court found that the worker was an employee. In fact, the Appeals Court reversed the worker's comp award issued by the Worker's Compensation Board on the basis that the WCB had no authority to find that Golosh was an employee, based on its reading of another case. The Georgia Supreme Court then determined that the determination of Golosh as an employee by the WCB was final and not reviewable since there was evidence to support it. So no, I don't think I'll take any legal advice from a site that does not understand in the least they case they (mis-)cited.

The part I left out of my quote is qualified further by several points that you left out about determining whether someone is classified as an employee for GA worker's comp purposes... in a manner that is virtually identical to the IRS' determination for whether someone is an employee.

Do you have any cases to cite where a worker who was determined by the IRS to be an independent contractor was determined by Georgia to be an employee for worker's comp purposes? At no point did I argue that there was no process to determine if someone is an employee in Georgia, but rather that the points you are emphasizing show that workers would almost certainly be found to be the same classification under GA Worker's Comp as under IRS rules.",1556668949
"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I don't see how this framework has any predictive power at all for determining the strength of the plastic, the load that one needs to apply to obtain permanent deformation, or the degree of recovery of the shape after the load is removed. 

OP: You can find more information by searching for ""yield strength"" + ""polymer"" (or even better, the specific plastic, such as PET for plastic water bottles). Materials yield (i.e., permanently deform) in different ways; in plastics, it's often the case that under large loads, the polymer chains begin to slide past each other rather than just unkinking, as they would for recoverable deformation. The chains may reorient and align, which can look like a cloudy area in a material that was formerly transparent. If the polymer is heavily crosslinked, it may be energetically preferable to simply form a crack, ultimately leading to fracture. 

In any case, the microscopic mechanisms can be linked to macroscale behavior in a predictive manner. Because of the many possible combinations of polymer formulations, crosslinking densities, and additives, failure mechanisms of plastics are currently a very active area of research.",1556668949

At certain points it's difficult to tell how the dynamic between the sisters works. Mainly just because the dialogue is mostly based on gut reactions. Characterization through the dialogue is pretty lacking, to be honest. Neither of the sisters exhibits much personality beyond the one note.

Consider adding some more scenes, perhaps. At the end of the script, it feels like not much has actually happened. As a result, all the switching points of view in the story don't feel as big as they should. Just because it's a short film doesn't mean it has to feel like one.

OP, I don’t know what your bf does for a living, but let’s say he does an office job.

Ask him how long he thinks it would be okay for him to go without any kind of shaving. Or combing his hair. Or washing. Or changing his clothes. 

Does he do those things (I hope😅) because shaving is just the funnest thing ever, and there’s so many different colors of razor and pretty-smelling shaving creams?  

Or does he do it because there ARE societal standards and expectations attached to grooming?",1556668950

At the same time, the towns and settlements protected by Caesar now gets access to the water previously enjoyed by the NCR. Caesar settling down in New Vegas creates a center of his empire, where before the center would be the current location of Caesar, though nominally Flagstaff would be the capital before. New Vegas has the resources and the infrastructure to be a proper capital for an empire, and once there Caesar will begin setting up a civilian administration of his empire. He will be unable to defeat the NCR completely, they will serve him well as the Carthage to his Rome, giving him a foreign force which can serve as a unifying enemy. The second stage of Caesar's plan, what he calls the defeat of the antithesis, and the creation of the synthesis, begins. He creates his own priesthood to stabilize his long-term empire through a pro-Legion religion, and further cements his version of a neo-Hellenic pantheon, with him in the center as the son of Mars. Once Caesar dies, the Legate-Courier takes over using the Antonian-Nervian style of choice for successors, creating a stable empire out of what was a roving army with towns paying tribute to them.

We had a colony at the park for years. The only time it grew was when someone threw their cat away there thinking the cat would adapt to the colony.

I like taking it all in and learning about the various things people interpret or emphasize. More broadly, I think the notion is that the laissez faire moderation approach is meant to be about secular acceptance of zen, but fails the tolerance paradox and tacitly promotes persecution.

The discourse I want to encourage isn't a specific topic or discussion, it's an approach to discussion. I want people to be able to come and express their ideas, challenge themselves, and grow for the experience.

Instead people are openly harassed and driven off for on topic content, because it doesn't match some user's personal ideological preferences.

I'd also like to promote earnest discussion along different vectors. For example, discussing academia is a bit different than discussing practice. Currently, some will use practice or academia to justify those same sorts of ideological harassment, picking the label that they think will best justify them telling others to shut up, agree, or leave.

Again, the notion being to promote a place where people can discuss zen, in whatever way that means to them, barring some critical mass of people claiming something is wildly off topic. So, instead of some people deciding for others what is and isn't zen, people have to decide for themselves.",1556668951

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Monitors","t5_2ts2a","Ultrawide is wayyyyy better than 2 monitors IMO, unless you're a productivity fiend and would benefit from 3+ monitors.

The only issues:

1. Ultrawide monitor tech has historically been behind vs more standard aspect ratio monitors unless you drop cash in the really high end i.e. hard to find one that is 144hz, supports gsync/freesync well, good QC, etc and it not be $2000. That said this is getting way better, some of the more recent UW ones launched are pretty great from what I hear.

2. Some games still have really awful support, most notably Overwatch. Most games however in this day and age are going to be fine or only have minor compromises. Check the games you like to play most and see how they work in UW resolutions before deciding on one. If your favorite games have awful support for it, you'll likely feel like it's a waste vs just doing a 2 monitor setup.

3. It's a monster performance hog. If you want to run the most demanding games on ultra settings above 100FPS, you'll need to SLI 2080's, but for most people you'll at least want one 1080/2080 minimum to game with them comfortably at high FPS/high quality.

Also, this is not a retcon. A retcon is when you change something earlier in the story later on. Tolkien rewriting the Gollum chapters in the Hobbit to make him not give up the one ring is a retcon. JK Rowling in book 7 having characters say ""blimey, Harry, we've never mentioned this before, but your invisibility cloak is actually different than all others!"" is a retcon. Making use of past story material to direct current story material, even when you didn't initially know where it's going, is... just writing with foreshadowing.",1556668952

A lot of people don't like this, as they see it as an obstacle, so the easiest thing to do is to ridicule it out of existence, which is a sad irony.

 Em discurso, durante evento no Palácio do Planalto, ele afirmou que acha que o número atual de pessoas sem emprego no país é superior a12 milhões. A pesquisa divulgada hoje mostrou que, ao todo, 13,4 milhões de brasileiros procuravam emprego no primeiro trimestre. 

 ""Se fala em 12 milhões de desempregados. Sim, eu acho que é muito mais que isso. Desculpe o IBGE, mas eu acho que é muito mais do que isso. Não vou polemizar novamente"", disse.

 Mais tarde, em entrevista à imprensa, ele ressaltou que não pretende entrar em [nova briga com o IBGE](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/04/em-resposta-a-bolsonaro-ibge-diz-que-pnad-segue-recomendacao-internacional.shtml). Em novembro, sem ainda ter assumido o cargo, o[ presidente chamou a pesquisa de ""farsa"" ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/11/bolsonaro-usa-informacoes-incorretas-ao-criticar-indicador-de-desemprego-no-pais.shtml)por considerar como empregadas pessoas que de fato não estariam ocupadas.

 ""Não vou entrar em briga com o IBGE, mas acho que a metodologia poderia ser aperfeiçoada, com todo respeito que a gente tem com o trabalho do IBGE"", afirmou nesta terça-feira.

 Segundo o IBGE, a taxa de subutilização da força de trabalho brasileira chegou a 25% no primeiro trimestre de 2019. Isso significa que 28,3 milhões de brasileiros não trabalharam ou trabalharam menos do que gostariam no período.

 É o maior índice desde o início da série histórica da Pnad (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílio) Contínua, iniciada em 2012. Na comparação com o trimestre encerrado em dezembro, houve alta de 5,6%, ou 1,5 milhão de pessoas.

 No primeiro trimestre sob o governo Bolsonaro, a taxa de desemprego no país foi de 12,7%, alta de 10,2% com relação ao trimestre encerrado em dezembro. Nos últimos três meses, 1,2 milhão de pessoas a mais passaram a procurar emprego no país.

 O número de empregados com carteira assinada no país permanece estável por quatro trimestres, em torno de 33 milhões de pessoas. A última vez em que houve crescimento no número de empregados com carteira na comparação com o trimestre anterior foi no segundo trimestre de 2014.",1556668954

It was something like covering a torn ligament with blood to help it heal because normally there’s less/no blood that contacts those sorts of parts.

If you think about it, the closer you get the surface of your skin, the further away those cells will be from fresh blood in your capillaries. There might be *some* merit to it is all I’m saying.

Tesla/Panasonic - from my perspective - have got a very good battery chemistry, which is not especially better than anybody else's right now, but they have really been able to drive down production costs and engineer those cells into very good battery packs for their vehicles. It seems to me that that's their big strength.
2. Making batteries at home? Don't think about trying, is my advice. For one thing, it involves some unpleasant materials, but mostly it will be a futile endeavour. Making a battery requires a lot of expensive equipment, special conditions such as dry rooms, and a lot of technical expertise.
3. The electrolyte in a battery is really only a medium for transferring charge, not storing it - so replacing the electrolyte would not constitute ""refueling"" in the recognisable sense, for most battery technologies. You would have to replace the electrodes, which could be a realistic proposition for some technologies, like redox flow batteries, perhaps.",1556668954

20 years ago when I was 17.  This is absolutely how I did it.  you'd just grab a stack of resumes, and walk through the mall and hope you got a call back on monday.   
  
15 years ago,  there was a noticiable push to apply online.  It was weird,  and people didn't know how to take it seriously.  Some businesess seriously wanted you to apply online,  while others would direct you to the website as their own way of politely telling you to fuck off because they weren't hiring.   applying through websites were mostly a waste of time.  

10 years ago,  many of the bigger chains were treating it as a requirement.    And it wasn't uncommon to send applications via email.

"croatia","t5_2qyps","Sin načelnika PU splitsko-dalmatinske je maznuo svom ocu službeni auto i pijan ga slupao iznad Bačvica krajem prošle godine. Mali mu je blago rečeno čovjeku sjebao karijeru koju je ovaj gradio cijeli svoj život. Mogu osobno potvrdit da je čovjek pošten i marljiv, nije sad da je došao do svoje pozicije podobnošću i članskim iskaznicam. Ukratko, otac je postupio nevjerojatno i neočekivano i posramio pola države tako što je preuzeo svu odgovornost na sebe, priznao krivnju i dao ostavku na svoje mjesto. Ponio se odgovorno i profesionalno, šta ćeš rijetko vidit kod bilo koga drugoga na tako visokoj poziciji. Tužna ironija u svemu tome je što taj čovjek nikad nije pio, otac mu je bio okorjeli alkos, a sin ga je došao glave isto zbog pića....

I have always struggled to make friends, but I’ve started making more and more acquaintances recently that have slowly been turning into friends.  I go to the club most Saturday nights and talk to lots of people there! It’s much easier for me personally to ask someone for a cigarette or offer to buy them a drink and strike up a conversation that way than it is for me to just approach someone randomly and start talking. I’m starting to make friends through new hobbies too. Recently I’ve become interested in mushroom hunting and have found some local groups to hunt with through Facebook. It’s early in the season where I am so there hasn’t been an official group hunt yet, but soon! I’m also involved in a few other hobby groups and have met a lot of people at meetups. A lot of the time they’re a little older though because of the nature of Facebook groups in general. If you’re religious, often churches have weekly activities for specific age groups. Some of them even have congregations for just young people without kids! I hike with my dog 3-4 days out of the week too and constantly run into other people with dogs. Usually we’ll stop and chat for a bit, but sometimes it turns into a much longer conversation. I’m sure if I run into the right person out there I’ll have a new friend eventually! Getting a second part time job somewhere would get you tons of new people to interact with and meet too. Plus it would help dampen the bills a smidge as well as the loneliness. One of my remaining close friends I met at a second job I worked last year! Somewhere with a high turnover rate would be easy to get hired onto and would give you a never ending chain of people your age to meet! Hopefully some of these ideas are useful! I just kind of threw together all things I’ve done to make friends in the last several months, so it’s a little disorganized. Good luck my man!",1556668956

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","The problem with your argument is two-fold.

Firstly: the police are supposed to be impartial investigators and to pursue all *reasonable* lines of enquiry, even those which assist the defence and point away from their own case.  That doesn't mean being silly about throwing resources down the drain in a mad attempt to disprove the claimant's story; but it does mean taking reasonable steps to ascertain the veracity of the complainant's story, and to disclose any information they come across which might help the defendant in preparing their defence.

If the police come across information that undermines their case, they have to record it and they have to disclose it.  A wilful blindness to that information - an attitude of, ""if I don't go looking for it then I won't find it"" - isn't permitted.

If the police don't pursue reasonable lines of enquiry, then the defence will claim that they have violated their obligations under guidance issued under [section 23 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1994](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/23), which requires police to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry during an investigation.

Secondly:  the deck is stacked in favour of the defendant.  If any doubt can be adduced at all, the defendant goes free.

Any defence barrister is going to say ""Well, there could be evidence on the victim's phone which might help us - but we'll never know because the police won't look at it!""  And as a result, a reasonable doubt is raised.  They will argue - probably successfully - that checking the victim's phone to corroborate the suspect's alibi was a ""reasonable line of enquiry"" that should have been pursued but wasn't.

This likely won't apply in cases of stranger rape, and those victims probably won't be asked to hand over their phones - but in cases of rape by someone known to the victim (which accounts for the majority of rapes), of **course** the defence is going to make a big fuss about seeing the victim's phone, because it costs them absolutely nothing and might get their client off.

Unfortunately, the victim's right to privacy does not trump the defendant's right to a fair trial.  If the defence case hinges on the victim's phone then it may well be necessary to see it in order to proceed with the prosecution.",1556668958

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O chanceler venezuelano Jorge Arreaza afirmou, em entrevista exclusiva à Folha, que os [fatos ocorridos nesta terça (30) em Caracas](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/30/5694-aovivo.shtml#post389409) são ""mais um capítulo do golpe de Estado que está em processo desde 23 de janeiro no país"". 

 Na data, o deputado Juan Guaidó se autoproclamou presidente da [Venezuela](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/venezuela/).

 Ele também acusa o presidente americano, Donald Trump, de incentivar um levante contra o governo de Nicolás Maduro. 

 ""Pela primeira vez os EUA não estão por trás de um golpe na região. Eles estão à frente do golpe"", afirma. ""Trump está chamando os militares venezuelanos a trair a Constituição e a reconhecer um presidente que não foi eleito constitucionalmente"", diz.

 ""O que há aqui é uma disputa dos norte-americanos e da elite venezuelana pela riqueza petroleira. De um lado estão eles, do outro está Maduro e o povo.""

 Ele afirma, ainda, que o presidente brasileiro, [Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/bolsonaro-convoca-reuniao-de-emergencia-sobre-a-situacao-na-venezuela.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/bolsonaro-convoca-reuniao-de-emergencia-sobre-a-situacao-na-venezuela.shtml), é ""conservador e neofascista"", mas uma figura menor na tentativa de golpe: ""Ele é apenas uma peça no xadrez de Trump"".

 ""Entendemos que Bolsonaro faz o que Trump manda. O povo brasileiro deve rechaçar. Não deve se deixar confundir pelo governo brasileiro nem pelos meios de comunicação"", diz. 

 ""A tolerância deve ser a característica das relações internacionais. E não a imposição de um pensamento único. A Venezuela tem problemas, o Brasil tem problemas, a Argentina também. Cada um deve buscar a sua solução"", segue.

 O chanceler afirma ainda confiar na neutralidade das Forças Armadas brasileiras diante das seguidas tentativas de ""golpe"" no país vizinho.

 ""Os militares brasileiros, até agora, têm mandado mensagens diretamente ao alto comando venezuelano afirmando que não vão intervir militarmente na Venezuela"", afirma ele.

 Diz ainda que, diante de uma ameaça de intervenção, ""nós responderemos"".

 Arreaza afirma que o vice-presidente Hamilton Mourão, apensar de ter sido adido militar no país, ""não conhece nada da Venezuela"". O general disse que o que ocorre no país é um caminho sem volta.

 O chanceler diz que, além dos militares, funcionários da diplomacia brasileira também teriam enviado recados no mesmo sentido, de não ingerência no país.

 ""Não vamos revelar seus nomes. Mas muitos deles estão envergonhados do governo brasileiro. O Itamaraty sempre foi uma cátedra da diplomacia. E hoje não é referência para nada no mundo.""

 Ele diz ainda que, apesar de todos os esforços e moblização do governo americano, ""pela primeira vez eles estão fracassando em um golpe"" na América Latina.

 Arreaza afirma que os EUA não têm medido esforços na tentativa de derrubar Maduro. ""Estão roubando o dinheiro venezuelano para dar aos conspiradores"", diz, referindo-se ao congelamento de bens de estatais da Venezuela nos EUA.

 Militares estariam recebendo oferta de dinheiro ao redor do mundo para trair Maduro. ""Agentes da CIA procuram as pessoas em nossas embaixadas e oferecem visto nos EUA, dinheiro, propriedade para que elas traiam a Venezuela.""

 Diz que isso já ocorreu inclusive no Brasil.

 Questionado se a saída do líder Leopoldo López de sua casa, em que estava em prisão domiciliar, com tanta facilidade não revelava que o governo Maduro já não tem o mesmo controle sobre a situação, o chanceler voltou a falar em dinheiro.

 ""Com 10 mil dólares, você compra um policial"", afirma.

 O fato de Leopoldo López já ter pedido asilo à embaixada do Chile demonstraria de forma cabal, segundo ele, que ""o golpe fracassou"".

 Questionado se o país poderia impedir López de sair da embaixada rumo ao Chile, ele afirmou: ""Ele é um homem condenado judicialmente. O governo e a Justiça vão avaliar"".

 O chanceler afirmou ainda que a ""revolução bolivariana"" é vítima de uma conspiração há mais de vinte anos, quando Hugo Chávez chegou ao poder ""e a riqueza do petróleo passou a ser investida em políticas sociais"".

 Ele disse lamentar que o Brasil esteja envolvido na tentativa de derrubada de Maduro. ""Apesar das diferenças, sempre nos demos bem com todos os governos brasileiros.""",1556668959

&gt;Yeah, that's a very terrible ethic to combat, what is in essence, a bad example of free speech with violence.

&gt;This is also why I don't do well when commenting on these types of posts: people want to feel morally superior while simultaneously advocating violence and they dislike it when I point it out.

As I said, advocating violence against those who seek to harm others is perfectly moral as many of the great liberal thinkers understood. 

If you cannot defend your reasoning then perhaps you haven't really thought it through? Your belief in the absolutism of freedom of speech is what I am arguing against. There are times when it can be moral to deny that right much like it can be moral to advocate violence against those to who seek to harm others.

&gt;You claimed we didn't become Nazis while simultaneously neglecting the wholesale firebombing of cities and civilian populations. GG.

Were we gassing Jews, gypsies, gays, the disabled? Were we engaging in a war of conquest based on a vile white supremacist ideology. Did we have plans to turn the Slavs and any non-Aryans into a sub-human underclass? No we were defending them against those who were. Did we do horrible things as part of that effort? Certainly, as I said there were some abhorrent actions by the allies, but the consequences of not acting would have been far worse and in no way did that make us Nazis.",1556668959

To clarify, I don’t think OP was an asshole for having an initial problem with it. If he was ignorant in the subject, that internal reaction would be reasonable ig. I’m more seeing the asshole aspect from letting his feelings control him and blowing up at his daughter as well as not consulting with his wife.

Plus if you have a Pollenbright Druid that's just sitting around as a 1/1 after doing their thing you can totally afford to sac that to kill something larger of an opponents if you need to.

A lot of the clients were super respectful and kind which is the category I would naturally place you in but a lot of them weren’t which is unfortunate. If visiting a prostitute was just about filling a need for sexual gratification then that would be great but unfortunately for some men it is about power and control which is unfortunate. I have legit been told that I was “owned” by men for the length of time that they paid for. So it’s a mixed bag I guess. 
I agree that a legal and regulated system where both clients and girls are registered and vetted would be the best for everyone involved. The city I was working in had just had a serial killer arrested for killing 20+ exploited women and those kinds of things would take the fact that the crime can be untraceable out of the equation. 
One way that I look at it is that all women in the sex trade whether they are there by choice or by force are being exploited in one way or another. I have yet to meet a woman who actually chose to be a prostitute without it being a last resort to financially support themselves. The stigma placed on the profession alone puts them in a vulnerable position in terms of being at risk for judgments, stereotypes, harassment and abuse.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I think you interact with people you disrespect just so that you can assign your own incorrect assessment on their words to set up your insults.  

When you take a position you can't back up with facts, no assumptions are needed.  It's very obvious. 

&gt;Of COURSE the chair has input. Every senator has input! 

Every Senator has input for their own assignments.  There are no votes on committee members.  The decisions are made by the party leader.  And no Democrat has control over who the Republicans put on the committee.  And you can't throw people off the committee without good reason (think Steve King).  The Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee in the 102nd Congress (1991-1993) were the exact same as the members in the 101st Congress.  So you're seriously blaming Joe Biden because, after the 1988 elections, Democrats didn't put Barbara Mikulski on the committee in preparation for a Supreme Court hearing in 1991?  Absolutely ridiculous.   You're stretching like no one has ever stretched before to find a way to blame Joe Biden. 

&gt;Just because the chair isn't the *final arbiter* doesn't mean they don't have a say.  I said *input*, not control. At the very least, they have their own vote and their own voice when the committee members are chosen.  And I never said or implied that members are selected for specific hearings.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The Senate lawyer questioning Blasey-Ford *worked* for republicans.  Kavanaugh was confirmed. 

That was a tactic to save Republicans from the embarrassment they faced during the Anita Hill hearing. 

And why would Democrats have brought in a lawyer to question Hill?  That doesn't make sense.  You do that if you think the person testifying might be lying.  Counsel is brought in by Senators who oppose the person testifying. 

What you're looking for is for the Democrats to have brought in a lawyer to question Thomas.  And that was unnecessary.  The lawyer did nothing to enhance the Kavanaugh hearing.  Democrats didn't need to hide behind anyone to question Thomas. 

You're literally just throwing bullshit at the wall to see what sticks and these attempts are so random that I have to keep your dumb theories consistent for you.  I don't see how this is easier for you than simply looking up the committee rules to back up your opinion.",1556668963

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A Justiça de São Paulo rejeitou pedido do presidente [Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/) (PSL) para ser indenizado pelo apresentador [Marcelo Tas](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/colunistas/cristina-padiglione/2019/03/marcelo-tas-recusa-convite-da-band-para-apresentar-edicao-bonus-do-masterchef-as-tercas.shtml), que em 2017 o chamou de racista, preconceituoso e homofóbico.  
   
 A juíza Mariana de Souza Neves Salinas, em decisão desta segunda-feira (29), afirmou que Tas apenas exerceu seu direito de expressão e não ofendeu o presidente.

 Bolsonaro entrou com a ação contra Tas pedindo a condenação dele por danos morais e o pagamento de indenização de R$ 20 mil. Ele também queria que a Justiça obrigasse o comunicador a não repetir os adjetivos para se referir a ele, com pagamento de multa diária de R$ 10 mil em caso de descumprimento.  
   
 A magistrada considerou que o apresentador ""apenas expressou livremente seu pensamento a respeito do tema, utilizando linguagem coloquial, sem a intenção de ofender ou injuriar"". Ela julgou improcedente o pedido de Bolsonaro e decidiu extinguir o processo.  
   
 A ação foi motivada por uma entrevista de Tas ao canal do jornalista Rica Perrone, publicada no YouTube em julho de 2017. Na ocasião, o entrevistado afirmou que ""o Bolsonaro é racista, é preconceituoso, é homofóbico"", mas ponderou que tinha respeito por ele, pelo fato de ser, na época, deputado federal.  
   
 ""Tem muitos estúpidos aí homofóbicos, alguns inclusive tentando ser candidatos a cargos importantes"", disse em outro momento da gravação.  
   
 Nos autos do processo, segundo a sentença, Bolsonaro ""asseverou nunca ter cometido atos de injúria racial, racismo ou homofobia"". Afirmou ainda que ""seus oponentes políticos e jornalistas o rotulam como modo de fugir do debate de ideias"".  
   
 A juíza Mariana Salinas, no entanto, refutou os argumentos do presidente. Na avaliação dela, o comentário de Tas não se referia à vida privada do político, mas à sua atuação como parlamentar e, na época, pré-candidato à Presidência da República.  
   
 ""Conquanto seja possível contestar a precisão da linguagem empregada, devemos ponderar que as expressões '[racista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/02/justica-inocenta-jean-wyllys-por-ter-chamado-bolsonaro-de-racista-e-canalha.shtml), preconceituoso e homofóbico' foram dispostas em linguagem coloquial, em meio a um programa de entrevista com viés informal e descontraído"", escreveu.

   
 Tas declarou à Justiça que não teve intenção de ofender o então deputado e que se embasou em manifestações do político ao longo de sua vida pública e de suas campanhas eleitorais.  
   
 Ele disse à **Folha** nesta terça-feira (30) ter ficado aliviado com a decisão favorável a ele, mas ao mesmo tempo preocupado com o cenário de ameaça à liberdade de opinião.  
   
 “Reafirmo tudo o que eu disse no vídeo, e não acho que eu deva ser processado por isso. É a minha opinião. Ele [Bolsonaro] coleciona uma série de frases evidentemente preconceituosas”, afirmou Tas.  
   
 O Palácio do Planalto informou, por meio de nota, que não irá se manifestar sobre o assunto.  
   
 Há alguns dias, curiosamente, Bolsonaro e Tas estiveram do mesmo lado do debate público, [ao defender o humorista Danilo ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/liberdade-de-expressao-e-direito-inviolavel-diz-bolsonaro-apos-caso-de-censura.shtml)[Gentili](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/liberdade-de-expressao-e-direito-inviolavel-diz-bolsonaro-apos-caso-de-censura.shtml) no episódio da condenação à prisão por injúria contra a deputada federal Maria do Rosário (PT-RS).  
   
 Ambos disseram que o direito à liberdade de expressão deveria ser resguardado.  
   
 “A maior ironia é que o Bolsonaro estava defendendo o direito de expressão enquanto, ao mesmo tempo, me processava por dizer o que penso”, afirmou o apresentador.  
   
 Tas disse que em ambos os casos —na ação movida por Maria do Rosário contra Gentili e na investida do presidente contra ele próprio— existe uma assimetria, já que os dois políticos dispunham de imunidade parlamentar e meios jurídicos para acionar seus alvos.  
   
 “Há uma desproporção de forças. Mesmo tendo ganho essa causa, acho preocupante tudo isso, porque nem todo mundo dispõe de recursos e tempo para se defender”, afirmou.  
   
 ""O político tem imunidade parlamentar, não pode ser processado, e o comediante ou jornalista fica numa posição muito desfavorável.""  
   
 Para Tas, os casos dele e de Gentili “são parecidos quanto à forma como se tentou tolher a expressão, mas totalmente diferentes no conteúdo”.",1556668964

"gravelcycling","t5_364gy","So...I have done a decent amount of research after I found a 2015 jamis bosanova locally and bought it. It seems the model you're talking about is what they sold after they stopped making the bosanova in 2015. The bikes sold for around the same price and had the same components down to the rack. They were around 1000-1200$ when new. 

It sounds like this seller is trying to sell it based on how much it's been used and unfortunately it wont sell that way. Even in perfect condition you would be hard pressed to find a buyer around 600$, and that could take months to years to find that buyer. On the used market I would say it's worth 300-600$ depending on where you're at. 

It just really depends on what you're doing with the bike. Will you find a barely used drop bar tiagra equipped bike for under 600$ new anywhere? Nope. Will you find a better deal on a new bike than what hes offering a used bike for?",1556668966

What amount of fuel/miles does it actually take to equal the cost of a car and associated cost?  Even say that the fuel is free to drive the car, you'd have to spend at least the amount you pay for the car/ins/maint/etc (only for fuel) to drive the truck to make buying and driving the car start to make sense.

First - fire hazard - check the xt60 connectors in the cable between the psu and the main board... if they are discoloured or hot while printing fix them.... best - replace the wire with a 14awg stranded thhn with spades on the psu end and either bare or ferrules on the other... second best - cut the connectors, solder and heatshrink the wires.... third choice - buy replacement xt60 and crimp tool and replace the connector...

Second issue - fire hazard - tinned ends on the wires in the screw terminals - pop the top of the control box.. take the wires out of the screw terminals 1 at a time, if they have solder on the ends clip it, strip it and put it back bare or with ferrules on it...

Third issue - fire hazard - update your firmware to enable thermal overload protection - none of the enders shipped to date have it enabled fully.... th3d makes it easy.... you will need an arduino uno and wires or buy their kit.....https://www.th3dstudio.com/knowledgebase/th3d-unified-firmware-package/

Last - small risk of shock hazard - unplig and use an ohm meter... check from the round ping on the cord to the shell of the psu and to the frame of the printer... both should be less than 1 ohm....if you read anything higher there is a screw on the psu tha goes through the metal case and board to ground the case.... there is an insulated sheet under the board.... loosen the screw and align the insulated sheet to allow the ground to make good contact....",1556668967

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O presidente Jair Bolsonaro admitiu nesta terça-feira (30) que pediu ao Banco do Brasil que abrisse uma agência na [única cidade do Maranhão que o elegeu.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/bolsonaro-segue-em-alta-em-cidade-com-52-de-evangelicos-no-maranhao.shtml)

 O banco, controlado pela União, tem ações negociadas na Bolsa de Valores e, por isso, tem sócios privados. 

 Em evento nesta terça-feira, Bolsonaro admitiu ter feito o pedido de instalação de uma agência no pequeno município de São Pedro dos Crentes (MA) diretamente ao presidente do banco, Rubem Novaes.

 Segundo o IBGE, a cidade tem pouco mais de 4.500 habitantes. 

 A falta de uma agência bancária e de calçamento da via principal da cidade foi alvo de reportagem da **Folha**.

 Bolsonaro disse que telefonou a Novaes e solicitou a agência.

 ""Liguei para o presidente do Banco do Brasil e perguntei se ele tinha no plano social dele a implantação de microagências nesses locais. Ele disse que não existe. Então eu solicitei 'existe a possibilidade de colocar uma agencia lá?' E ele já botou"", afirmou o presidente. ""Ficamos felizes com isso, atende o município que tem menos de 2 mil eleitores. Mas o que buscamos não é quantidade é qualidade.""

 As tecnologias têm alterado a atividade bancária e vem provocando uma redução no número de agências pelos bancos. No ano passado, a Caixa anunciou a intenção de fechar agências consideradas insustentáveis. 

 A revelação de Bolsonaro ocorreu um dia depois de o presidente apelar publicamente ao Banco do Brasil para baixar a taxa de juros.

 O presidente aproveitou o evento, para o lançamento de uma medida provisória batizada pelo governo de MP da Liberdade Econômica, para desabafar contra os críticos. Ele disse que não tem poder para [interferir na taxa de juros praticada pelo BB.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/04/bolsonaro-nao-quer-e-nao-intervira-em-juros-do-bb-diz-porta-voz.shtml)

 Segundo Bolsonaro, ao propor a redução dos juros para o setor agropecuário, fez apenas um apelo.

 ""Faltou complementar. Sem a complementação, fui massacrado por grande parte da mídia. Não posso esquecer nada, tenho de ser mais do que perfeito, tenho de ser sublime, senão tudo dá errado"", disse.

 O presidente ressaltou que apenas dá sugestões aos auxiliares do governo e que ""cada um cumpre se achar que deve cumprir"".

 ""Ontem, na Agrishow, eu apelei para o presidente do Banco do Brasil, Rubem Novaes, para o seu espírito patriótico, conservador e cristão, que atenda os ruralistas [no tocante das taxas de juros](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/04/acoes-do-banco-do-brasil-caem-apos-bolsonaro-pedir-queda-de-juro.shtml)"", disse.

 Na semana passada, Bolsonaro também pediu ao presidente da instituição financeira para tirar do ar uma propaganda que abordava a diversidade racial e sexual no Brasil.

 O Ministério Público pediu ao TCU (Tribunal de Contas da União) que apure se houve prejuízos ao Banco do Brasil a decisão de vetar o anúncio televisivo.",1556668969

If the pension loan and insurance are taken out PER PAY that is outrageous. esp the insurance. ( I am 31 so obv biased from age but still)

As for cybersecurity, that is a very broad area. If you are looking to get into university level research etc.. then you would want to go for the CS degree and all the advanced math that goes along with it.

"Shadowverse","t5_3c35m","Yeah. Lecia is the daughter of Admiral Walfrid, and the captain of an airship. Her father leads the Fleet of the White Wing, an airfleet dedicated to the goddess Aether.

One day, while fighting Forte's army of dragons, she and her ship are swallowed into the ~~Warp~~ Realm of Chaos. With her superior officer, Celia, having gone completely insane from the powers of chaos, Lecia must deal with a hostile environment and a crew whose morale is rock bottom. She stumbles across the Twilight Sword and the spirit residing within it: Nano. It holds the power to destroy literally anything, but dooms the owner to a horrible fate. In spite of knowing this, Lecia is willing to sacrifice herself by making a contract, all so that her subordinates can make it out of the Realm of Chaos alive. This impresses Nano and she helps her fight her way out.

The lore matches the cards in the following ways:

\-Lecia was originally a very selfish person, who only sought glory to match her father's. But she becomes a selfless hero when she realizes that the lives of her crew rest on her shoulders. Lecia only starts to evolve as a character after she takes her subordinates into account. To reflect this, Lecia starts off as a mere 3/3 with no other abilities, but evolves when a soldier is played. Commander/Officer is actually Officer/Soldier in Japanese. The idea being that, when Lecia sees a soldier being played, she realizes the weight of her responsibilities and evolves.

\-Nano has the power to destroy anything, thus she has bane. She is not a corporeal being, so like ghosts, she is a 1/1.

\-Twilight Sword destroys anything in its path. Enough said.

\-Aether is the patron goddess of the White Wing Fleet. Therefore, the fact that players use her to fetch Lecia was probably planned from the start.",1556668972

For me what helped me getter better was paying attention to what i did before goals scored on my team.

Mas o chamado das rodas e dos terreiros, do som dos subúrbios e dos botequins, bateu-lhe mais forte nas veias.

 Morreu nesta terça-feira (30), às 17h33, no Rio de Janeiro, aos 72 anos, em decorrência de infecção generalizada. Desde o início do ano, estava internada no Hospital Pró-Cardíaco. 

 Em 1972 ela resolveu procurar Nelson Cavaquinho e cavar um samba inédito. Aos 26 anos, ainda com rostinho de menina, teve de vencer o medo que sentia daquele homem de pele azeitonada, cabelos prateados e olhos de peixe morto, que podia ser um grosso ao tratar com as pessoas, e estava sempre ou tocando violão ou levantando copos. Ganhou “Folhas Secas”, gravada no LP “Canto por um Novo Dia” (1973), o primeiro inteiramente dedicado ao samba.

 “Folhas Secas” –que também teve um registro de Elis Regina na mesma época e acabou criando uma rusga entre as duas cantoras– virou um clássico instantâneo na voz de Beth. Assim como o samba-canção “As Rosas Não Falam”, de[ Cartola](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2010/03/711778-cartola-e-tema-do-terceiro-volume-da-colecao-folha.shtml), garimpado para o disco de 1976, “Mundo Melhor”. No ano seguinte repetiu a dose com o mesmo compositor, gravando a obra-prima “O Mundo é um Moinho”, última faixa de “Nos Botequins da Vida”, um de seus melhores trabalhos.

 Àquela altura, Beth Carvalho era uma sambista batizada e crismada, queridíssima no meio, respeitada tanto na Mangueira (sua escola do coração) como na rival Portela, com olho clínico para descobrir pepitas desconhecidas do grande público. E com memória de HD para guardar zilhões de músicas na cabeça.

 (Sou testemunha e dou fé: ouvi Beth enfileirar o repertório quase completo de Nelson Cavaquinho —sobretudo aqueles sambas que o próprio jamais lembraria— numa noite de cerveja farta no Mirante do Leblon.)

 Em 1974, o estouro de “1800 Colinas”, de Gracia do Salgueiro, indicou o caminho: “Ó Deus, eu preciso encontrar meu amor/ Pra matar a saudade que quer me matar”. Quem hoje escuta essa gravação quase amadora em recursos técnicos, realizada na nanica Tapecar, tem a certeza de que Beth foi uma genuína sambista —sofisticada e ao mesmo tempo de enorme apelo popular.

 Elizabeth Santos Leal de Carvalho nasceu no Rio de Janeiro, no dia 5 de maio de 1946. Desde pequena, com a mãe, frequentou a avenida, atraída pelo som do surdo, e ouviu a coleção de discos do pai: muito Silvio Caldas e Elizeth Cardoso, Aracy de Almeida cantando Noel Rosa.

 Típica adolescente da zona sul carioca, aluna do tradicional colégio Andrews, apaixonou-se nos anos 1960 pela batida do violão de João Gilberto. Resolveu aprender o instrumento para não fazer feio nas festinhas de apartamento e no circuito de shows amadores em colégios e faculdades.

 Sua carreira como cantora profissional começou justamente na onda da bossa nova. Em 1964 gravou um compacto com “Por Quem Morreu de Amor”, da dupla Menescal &amp; Bôscoli. Mas, no ano seguinte, lá estava o gênero centenário lhe rondando: participou do show “A Hora e a Vez do Samba”, ao lado de Nelson Sargento e Noca da Portela.

 No auge dos festivais, tirou o terceiro lugar no FIC de 1968 com “Andança”, de Edmundo Souto, Paulinho Tapajós e Danilo Caymmi, que na época também iniciavam suas carreiras. Na própria casa da cantora, Danilo e Edmundo compuseram a melodia (a parte do famoso contraponto é uma sacada de Danilo), enquanto Paulinho fez a letra que fala sobre a vida de um andarilho.

 Foi seu primeiro grande sucesso e a música que tornou Beth Carvalho conhecida em todo o país. Desde então, nunca mais alguém deixou de cantar “Andança”, esgoelando-se numa rodinha de acampamento no mato e maltratando as cordas de um violão.

 Ela esteve na ponta de lança de uma explosão musical. Cinquenta anos depois da geração pioneira do Estácio –que, no fim dos anos 1920, deu formato ao samba urbano moderno– uma roda de pagode feita por desconhecidos amadores, na quadra de um bloco do subúrbio carioca, alterou a forma de se tocar e compor samba, revelando uma nova matriz na evolução do gênero.

 Foi um momento de transformação, com direito a instrumentos adaptados, quase inventados, que trouxeram uma dinâmica diferente ao ritmo: o repique de Sereno, o tantã de Ubirany e o banjo de Almir Guineto, todos integrantes na época do conjunto Fundo de Quintal.

 A turma do Cacique de Ramos —Guineto, Zeca Pagodinho, Arlindo Cruz, Jorge Aragão, Luiz Carlos da Vila, Jovelina Pérola Negra e outros mais— apareceu, entre o fim da década de 1970 e o início da de 1980, sob as bênçãos da “madrinha” Beth, que em 1978 gravou o LP “De Pé no Chão”, um dos marcos da novidade.

 A faixa de abertura, “Vou Festejar” (de Jorge Aragão, Dida e Neoci), tornou-se o maior sucesso do Carnaval no ano seguinte: “Chora/ Não vou ligar/ Chegou a hora/ Vais me pagar/ Pode chorar...”. Era um típico samba de embalo, feito para o Cacique, que, no entanto, não chegou a ser cantado nos desfiles do bloco. A música, apresentada com a forte percussão em primeiro plano, foi a peça que abriu os caminhos para a moda do pagode, que dominaria a produção fonográfica brasileira nos anos seguintes.

 No livro “A Canção no Tempo (1958-1985)”, os pesquisadores Jairo Severiano e Zuza Homem de Mello contam que, num show de Beth Carvalho em São José dos Campos, no interior paulista, as mulheres da plateia espontaneamente tiraram os sapatos de grife, marcando neles o ritmo de “Vou Festejar”, num momento contagiante.

 Era a prova definitiva de que a inovação do subúrbio começava a ganhar o país. O chamado “pagode pop” ou “pagode romântico” foi uma contrafação, surgida por imposição das gravadoras nos anos 1990, do som criado no Cacique e divulgado pela cantora carioca.

 Fora da música, teve duas paixões: na política, Leonel Brizola, para quem gravou um jingle em 2000, quando o ex-governador se candidatou a prefeito do Rio. No futebol, o Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas. Seu jogo inesquecível foi a final do Campeonato Brasileiro de 1995, quando o clube de General Severiano sagrou-se campeão com gol de Túlio.

 Um amor tão louco que levou a cantora a fazer algo raro na sua longa carreira de mais de 30 discos e cinco DVDs: gravar um samba boi-com-abóbora, “Esse é o Botafogo que eu Gosto”, de Dom Elias: “Esse é o Botafogo que eu gosto/ Esse é o Botafogo que eu mereço/ Tanto tempo esperando esse momento, meu Deus/ Deixa eu festejar que eu mereço”.

 Beth sofreu com problemas na coluna durante toda a última década. Ao longo dos últimos anos, mesmo com a mobilidade limitada, a sambista seguiu se apresentando em cadeira de rodas.

 Um das imagens de 2018 foi protagonizada pela cantora: vestida de amarelo-oxum e acompanhada do Fundo de Quintal, cantou o samba “Isaura”, de Rubens da Mangueira.[ Até aí nada demais, se Beth não estivesse deitada numa chaise longue. ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/09/com-dores-na-coluna-beth-carvalho-faz-show-deitada-no-rio-de-janeiro.shtml)Não havia outro jeito. Ela ficou ao lado do samba até o fim.

 Aberto aos fãs, o velório da cantora será realizado nesta quarta (1º), a partir das 10h, no salão nobre da sede do Botafogo, na avenida Venceslau Brás, 72, Rio de Janeiro. Às 16h o corpo seguirá em cortejo para o crematório do Caju, onde ocorrerá cerimônia apenas amigos e familiares.",1556668974

One suggestion for you though. I think you should stop calling it ""lightning bitcoin"".

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","The only objective parameters for a ""good"" sensitivity is having it low enough to be precise and incorporate your arm to at least some degree, even if very minor, but being able to turn around in one motion when necessary. The only reason incorporating your arm is a requirement is because your wrist can't move forward or back. You need to use your arm to aim up and down, and having your sensitivity low enough for your arm to participate in even a minimal way will make instances where you must make large up and down movements more comfortable and ultimately consistent.

If the changes you make are minor (i.e. not changing by more than a couple of points at a time) you're not seriously hurting your muscle memory, but I would still advise against it.

In the midst of an off day, consider the following factors before changing your sensitivity. Are you warmed up (obvious, just being thorough)? Are you focused on the game in general? Are you focused literally with your eyes on the target you're shooting at? Is your arm participating in aiming (common one for me, especially when playing my first shooter of the day)? If all of these factors are ruled out, off days happen. Don't change your sensitivity for a day or two and see if the same pattern continues, OR change it for your session but note the number you came from and return to it.

Bottom line is do what works, sensitivity is a means to an end. In general, sticking with one sensitivity is the correct thing to do as outside of practice, aim is mostly muscle memory and not conscious effort. Inconsistency happens to everyone, some more than others.",1556668976

We already have working decently scaled proof that it works not only economically, but also socially and helps people spend less money over all in comparison to the cost of poverty, which is higher than people think. You pay a lot to be poor, both as an individual and as a country.

"iastate","t5_2qtol","I have live in the residence halls all 5 years, one of those years being a triple. I was 19 at the time so there wasn't a gap, but one thing I found out is that you don't get a lot of time with the room to yourself. Especially if you have a roommate that tends to have people over and hang out in the room for the majority of the day. You do want everyone to loft their beds in triples to make the room feel bigger. In my triple we all lofted, had our 2 people put their desks underneath while the other had a futon, we lined up two of the closets with the 3rd desk next to that and had the other on the opposite side. We were still able to fit a big chair with an ottoman. We didn't feel crowded at all.

With the age gap, it should be manageable. I asked helped a lot of my freshman roommates with getting around. You could both figure stuff out together.

Most space are filled, it it will be hard to get your first choice, but you never know. Occupancy was lower this school year than the last so you could get something. If you don't like where you are living the beginning of the semester, there is a time period to switch rooms, houses or hall. You just need to inform DOR which is in Friley hall.

When it comes to avoiding halls, it depends on how much your are willing to pay. I didn't want to live in towers either and went with Helser since it was the next cheapest option and it wasn't in the best conditions, especially since it was supposed to be temporary housing. What I'm trying to say, the older the building, the more problems there could be.

Hopefully this helps. 😁",1556668979

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O [presidente Jair Bolsonaro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2019/04/bolsonaro-e-apenas-uma-peca-no-xadrez-de-trump-diz-chanceler-venezuelano.shtml)disse nesta terça-feira (30) que é ""próxima de zero"" a possibilidade de o Brasil participar, ainda que de forma indireta, de uma [intervenção militar na Venezuela](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/30/5694-aovivo.shtml#post389414).

 ""A hipótese de nós participarmos de forma mesmo indireta de uma intervenção armada é muito difícil, não vou dizer que é zero, mas é próxima de zero"", afirmou em entrevista ao programa Brasil Urgente, da TV Bandeirantes.

 Bolsonaro lembrou que uma ação militar não é descartada pelo presidente americano, [Donald Trump, e que se os EUA](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/colombia-pede-reuniao-de-emergencia-sobre-venezuela-evo-defende-maduro-veja-repercussao.shtml) solicitassem uso de território brasileiro ele analisaria o caso.

 ""Eu entendo que isso não é uma figura de retórica por parte dele [Trump], é uma possibilidade, sim. Em ele, por ventura, querendo usar o território brasileiro, eu digo o seguinte: eu convocaria o Conselho Nacional de Defesa, ouviria todas as autoridades do Conselho Nacional de Defesa e tomaria uma decisão"", afirmou.

 Nas redes sociais, o presidente disse que uma decisão sobre ação militar do Brasil no país vizinho é de exclusividade do chefe do Executivo.

 ""A situação da Venezuela preocupa a todos. Qualquer hipótese será decidida exclusivamente pelo presidente da República, ouvindo o Conselho de Defesa Nacional. O governo segue unido, juntamente com outras nações, na busca da melhor solução que restabeleça a democracia naquele país"", escreveu.

 Logos depois, o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), retrucou Bolsonaro e afirmou que uma declaração de guerra contra a Venezuela precisaria de aprovação do Congresso.  
   
 ""Em relação ao tuite do presidente Jair Bolsonaro sobre a situação da Venezuela, é importante lembrar que os artigos 49, II c/c art 84, XIX; c/c art. 137, II da Constituição Federal precisam ser respeitados"", escreveu o deputado nas redes sociais.   
   
 ""E eles determinam que é competência exclusiva do Congresso Nacional autorizar uma declaração de guerra pelo Presidente da República.""  
   
 A resposta pública de Maia mostra que a relação entre os presidentes dos Poderes continua tensa, apesar dos gestos de aproximação da semana passada, em que Bolsonaro agradeceu a Maia em pronunciamento. 

 Ainda durante a entrevista, Bolsonaro falou que não é tradição do Brasil o envolvimento em conflitos de outros países e que, na sua visão, isso seria uma aventura nesse momento.

 ""Nós não queremos falar em invasão da Venezuela, teria que analisar muita coisa. Até que tipo de guerra seria isso dai. Isso seria uma aventura no meu entender. Agora, em última análise, em última hipótese existe essa questão, mas não nós invadirmos, não é a nossa vocação"", afirmou.

 Questionado sobre se o governo brasileiro está em contato com os EUA, Bolsonaro não deu detalhes, mas informou que isso passa pela área de inteligência de seu governo e que ele é informado de todos os dados.

 ""Nós trabalhamos de forma bastante unida buscando a solução para o problema de forma pacifica. Esse é o nosso objetivo número um, mas como todo bom militar você tem que analisar todas as hipóteses, mas não passa pela nossa cabeça ainda qualquer ação militar na Venezuela.

 Ele repetiu mais de uma vez que Trump —a quem se referiu ser uma pessoa que ""admira, respeita e por quem torce muito""— conta com todas as possibilidades à mesa sobre a Venezuela.

 Depois da entrevista de Bolsonaro, o porta-voz da Presidência da República, Otávio Rêgo Barros, disse que o governo descarta completamente participar de uma intervenção militar, mas não desconsiderou completamente uma ação indireta —o uso de território brasileiro para que forças estrangeiras, como a dos EUA, operem na Venezuela.

 Apesar disso, Rêgo Barros disse que trata-se de ""uma possibilidade muito pequena"" e que o governo não vislumbra essa hipótese neste momento.",1556668979

But aside from the impressive technology for the time and the director, there isn't really a whole lot great about the movie itself. Most of it was really forgettable.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Like you said, go slow. Only incorporate one product at a time at a time so if you react, you know the culprit. Patch test before. Some people react to a product straight away while others it takes a week or two. 

I really recommend with solidifying your basic routine first. Find a gentle cleanser, moisturizers, and sunscreen. Once you have this down, then try other things. I say this because if anything new damages or irritates your skin, you have your basic routine to fall back to while it heals. Sunscreen is your best for prevention of nearly all the unwanted skin uglies. Also super important once you start using actives as it can make your skin more sensitive. 

If your skin feels tight, you get any irritation, or something burns that normally is soothing...stop and peel back to the basics. It's so easy to over do it and damage your skin.

With any actives (BP, aha, bha, retinol, etc) - start super slow. Like once every 3 days. If you're already dry or dehydrated you can do more damage than help. So I always suggest to make sure your moisture barrier is okay before doing anything crazy. It's better to start slow and see slow progress as your ramp up than to bomb your face and feel like you've turned into a hideous monster.

Good luck!",1556668980

You don’t deserve more than a “Hey,” and he doesn’t deserve more than a “Hey.”

Nobody is trying to impress someone with super witty banter right off the bat.  You literally know nothing about each other.  

Social protocol:

- introduction
- testing and calibration
- building rapport
- determination (interested, not interested?)
- either end interaction, diplomatically reject by being “friends,” or express romantic interest

I did not make this myself, I found it on another subreddit where I believe the originator of the meme intended it to take its usual meaning, but their lack of knowledge of economics lead to the incorrect conclusion and their meme ended up taking the correct course of action instead of the incorrect one as intended.",1556668980

""respond or behave in a particular way in response to something.""

Aside from the fact that ""react"" can include having an emotional response, react quite literally means to DO an ACTION

In both cases, the sector of the industry that does ADR for foreign produced cartoons is a narrow subset of that industry. I'm not sure which is bigger, Japanese VA doing american films and television for local distribution or the us anime localisation industry. Either way it's a small portion of the industry overall in both cases.

ADR has it's own unique set of challenges that separate it from VA work for domestically produced animation. Translation and timing issues working with finished animation made to fit another langauge's structure, cultural references, mannerisms, ettiquette, idioms and puns that don't translate 1:1. ADR isn't just voice acting talent either. It's a team of localisers that have to balance these competing demands to produce something that is acceptably accurate to the original while still fitting the finished animation and sounding natural in the target language. It's a specialised field, and thus inevitably has a limited workforce. It's just the nature of the beast.",1556668980

Other users tell me they can create a new checking account, move all the transactions from the credit card to the checking account, then delete the empty credit card account.  Some account re-naming is required to end up where you want to be.

You do need to be aware that the normal balance of a credit card is negative, and if it is set up as a checking account this means it is deducted from TBB for the new account.  The total budget will be based on the net of the positive cash accounts and the card set up as checking, implicitly reserving the ability to pay the card in full at any given time.  This does not work well for people who are carrying credit card debt from month to month, and it can squeeze categories for people living on the float.  For this purpose, ""float"" is defined as paying the full statement balance of the card every month, but having times during the month when it would not be possible to pay the full working balance of the card.",1556668981

Para além das qualidades vocais, destacou-se por ideias e práticas corajosas, dignas de uma artista consciente de seu papel social. Nunca foi exatamente o que se esperava dela. Nunca foi unanimidade, o que só conta a seu favor.

 Branca de classe média, ela poderia ter ficado na praia da bossa nova e da chamada MPB —que foi gestada em festivais como aquele de 1968 em que ela cantou “Andança”. Mas escolheu o samba. E uma escolha dessas não pode ser meramente profissional. Virou opção de vida, como o samba costuma exigir que seja.

 Investida de sinceridade, conquistou o primeiro time dos compositores do gênero, como Cartola (de quem lançou “As Rosas Não Falam”) e Nelson Cavaquinho (de quem só não lançou “Folhas Secas” porque Cesar Camargo Mariano desviou a música para Elis Regina). Passou a transitar entre diferentes estilos e gerações. Cumprindo rito quase obrigatório, associou-se com paixão a uma escola de samba, a Estação Primeira de Mangueira.

 Poderia, então, ter assegurado seu lugar de respeitável intérprete e personagem do samba. Mas resolveu mexer mais fundo nessa terra fértil. O disco “Nos Botequins da Vida” (1977) indicou já no título a decisão de ir aonde o samba nasce e circula, em vez de esperar pela chegada dele. Os melhores resultados foram os sucessos “Saco de Feijão”, do portelense Chico Santana, e “Olho por Olho”, de Zé do Maranhão e Daniel Santos.

 Nas suas andanças por bares e subúrbios cariocas, Beth chegou à quadra do bloco Cacique de Ramos, onde ocorriam descompromissadas rodas de samba. Descobriu sons e composições que levou para o LP “De Pé no Chão”, o mais importante de sua carreira. Deu o primeiro passo para um novo capítulo da história do samba.

 Não sossegou e continuou divulgando os craques daquela área: Jorge Aragão, Luiz Carlos da Vila, Almir Guineto, Arlindo Cruz, Sombrinha, Zeca Pagodinho —​a quem lançou em 1983 num duo em “Camarão que Dorme a Onda Leva”.

 Foi então que virou a Madrinha do Samba. Com o tempo, o bonito título virou grilhão, e ela passou a exercê-lo sem parcimônia. Alguns artistas não ficaram à vontade no papel de afilhados. Mas ela também não se acomodou no rótulo.

 Quando as rádios já estavam fechadas para o melhor samba e Beth há muito não vendia dezenas ou centenas de milhares de discos, ela de novo subverteu a ordem: levantou a bandeira do pagode (o de mesa, o de chão, não o dos estúdios cobertos de teclados) e voltou a cantar para grandes públicos. Os discos foram “Pérolas do Pagode” (1998), “Pagode de Mesa – Ao Vivo 1” (1999) e “Pagode de Mesa – Ao Vivo 2” (2000).

 Faro para sucessos ela sempre teve, como provam “Coisinha do Pai” (1979), “A Chuva Cai” (1980) e “Firme e Forte” (1983). O conceito de sucesso é que mudou no país, frequentemente para pior.

 [Símbolo da carioquice](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/beth-carvalho-foi-uma-das-maiores-maravilhas-do-brasil-diz-caetano-veloso.shtml), também gravou sambas de São Paulo (1993) e da Bahia (2007). Os discos dedicados às obras de Nelson Cavaquinho (2001) e Cartola (2003) foram mais previsíveis, mas nem por isso menos significativos.

 Cantou de cadeira de rodas, [cantou deitada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2018/09/com-dores-na-coluna-beth-carvalho-faz-show-deitada-no-rio-de-janeiro.shtml), sambou como foi possível na cama do hospital. Fez do samba sua opção de vida e da vida uma permanente transformação. Mais do que boa cantora, Beth foi alguém que melhorou a qualidade e o caráter da música brasileira e do Brasil.",1556668984

For my fine hair this looks terrible - the stringy curls are like something from the 90's. I would guess that clumping might weigh the hair down a bit, which is why it gets more wavy.

YOU WOULD NEED ABOUT 22.72 SHOTS OR 23 SHOTS TO KILL ROSA WITH SUPER. THE NEW UPDATE HOWEVER IS 70% DMG REDUCTION.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Mid 50s here.  I also lift and do cardio multiple times per week.  I also am always working around one minor injury or other.

I like to think I'm learning to better avoid and manage injuries over time.  I have rules about how fast to increase volume and load (i.e. very gradually).  I have read up on best rehab strategies for tendon injuries, and have successfully rehabbed several such.

It helps to not be married to any particular exercise.  If running starts to bug my knees, I switch cardio methods for a while.  If squats start to bug my hips, I switch to another squat variant and lower volume -- do more deadlifts instead.  Dave Tate (a retired powerlifter) says, ""concentrate on what you can do, not what you can't do anymore"".

Inevitably, we will decline with age.  Injuries/illnesses get more frequent, recovery takes longer, regaining strength/conditioning takes longer.

But if we keep training what we can train, we can still spend most of our days making gains between each setback.  And that feels pretty good.",1556668986

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","They didn’t have any battles shown on the first 1-2 seasons because they didn’t had the budget to do so, it’s on one of their videos in HBO/GOT’s Youtube channel I think.

With “this story sucks” you’re talking about this season? Or..? Because if it sucks then why are you here? I get that people complain about the OUT OF SOURCES last seasons (you said it yourself) but to call it Transformers 9 is just wrong. When I talk about Game of Thrones I think of it as whole, we’ve already seen political intrigue and cunning dialogues especially with characters such as LF, early Varys (when he mattered, he should be dead by now), TL, etc etc. Imagine 8 seasons of just that, betrayal after betrayal x100 or Littlefinger’s many accents. It would be boring. The action had to happen at some point. 

Also why do I get the feeling that you’re being passive aggressive with me? “If you were even watching then” Dude I started my love for Game of Trones in the early 2000s. You can call me an idiot if you want, I certainly don’t believe that being happy because one of the stories you love is reaching it’s end should be labeled as being an idiot or happy because “at least it’s something”. Again, I get the criticism and I want you to know that I do understand what you’re talking about. But Game of Thrones will never be Transformers 9.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Em nome da família de Jorge Seif Júnior, atual secretário de aquicultura e pesca, há pelo menos dez multas ambientais, a maior parte por infrações de pesca, segundo levantamento da **Folha.** A mais grave delas é pelo transporte de mais de 12 mil kg de cherne-poveiro, espécie classificada como criticamente em risco de extinção

 Partiu de Seif Júnior o pedido de [suspensão da lista de animais aquáticos ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/04/ministerio-da-agricultura-pede-fim-da-lista-de-animais-aquaticos-ameacados.shtml)[ameaçados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/04/ministerio-da-agricultura-pede-fim-da-lista-de-animais-aquaticos-ameacados.shtml). 

 A JM Seif Transportes Ltda., empresa de Jorge Seif, pai do secretário de pesca, foi multada pelo Ibama em R$ 300 mil, em 18 de agosto de 2014, pelo transporte, no Rio de Janeiro, do cherne-poveiro, que não poderia ser pescado.

 À época, vigorava a instrução normativa 37/2005, do MMA (Ministério do Meio Ambiente), assinada pela então ministra Marina Silva, proibindo por dez anos a captura e comercialização do cherne-poveiro (*Polyprion **americanus*), que já constava na lista de 2004 de animais ameaçados.

 Mesmo com a proibição —motivada pela redução de 90% na abundância da espécie—, a captura e o comércio do peixe não eram incomuns. Segundo um levantamento de 2014 da ONG SOS Mata Atlântica, era possível achar o cherne-poveiro à venda no Rio de Janeiro.

 A multa pelo transporte da espécie criticamente ameaçada de extinção, segundo a lista mais recente de animais aquáticos em risco, ainda não foi paga pela JM Seif Transportes Ltda. 

 A infração mais recente levantada pela **Folha** diz respeito à pesca de 24 mil kg de tainha (*Mugil liza*) em área proibida com o barco Mtanos Seif. Desde 2015, há um plano de gestão para uso sustentável e pesca da espécie.

 Outras infrações associadas à família de Seif Junior dizem respeito à pesca em período de defeso (proteção de espécies em fases críticas de ciclo de vida, como a época de reprodução), comercializar indivíduos com tamanho inferior ao permitido por lei, pesca sem autorização, pescar e descaracterizar espécie de tubarão e realizar, sem licença, obra para um cais de concreto sobre o rio Itajaí-Açu, em Santa Catarina.

 A família Seif é proprietária de uma frota de embarcações e conhecida no universo pesqueiro brasileiro pela ação da empresa de Jorge Seif, a JS Captura e Comércio de Pescados Ltda.

 Seif Junior era ativo na empresa da família até assumir a Secretaria de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP). 

  

 Recentemente, a **Folha **teve acesso ao [pedido de suspensão temporária da lista de espécies aquáticas ameaçadas de extinção](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/04/ministerio-da-agricultura-pede-fim-da-lista-de-animais-aquaticos-ameacados.shtml). A demanda da SAP, que faz parte do Ministério da Agricultura (Mapa), afirmava que o cadastro desses animais gerou repercussão negativa no setor pesqueiro e prejuízos econômicos.

 A “Lista Nacional das Espécies da Fauna Brasileira Ameaçadas de Extinção - Peixes e Invertebrados Aquáticos”, publicada em 2014, busca identificar espécies que estejam de alguma forma em risco e proíbe captura, transporte, armazenamento, guarda, manejo, beneficiamento e comercialização dos animais listados. A versão de 2018 da lista conta com 410 espécies. 

 ### Outro lado

 À **Folha** Seif Junior afirmou que o levantamento das multas, com base em dados públicos, tem o intuito de trazer problemas. “Com todo o respeito, isso é para polemizar. O que isso agrega à sociedade? É para desqualificar uma pessoa que está trabalhando no governo.”

 O secretário diz que quem deveria responder sobre as multas é seu pai, proprietário das empresas da família.

 Ainda assim, Seif Junior disse que, no caso do cherne-poveiro, a empresa de seu pai tinha sido contratada para fazer o transporte de uma carga e que na nota fiscal não constava a espécie criticamente ameaçada. “Não tínhamos conhecimento da carga.”

 A classificação de risco do animal também é questionada pelo secretário, que já trabalhou com a pesca da espécie no Uruguai. “O cherne-poveiro, se não me engano, já está indo para 12 ou 13 anos de proteção. Cadê a pesquisa? Está proibida ad aeternum [a pesca]? Isso é coisa de cabeça de ambientalista com viés ideológico, não é questão de sustentabilidade, é loucura.”

 Sobre outras autuações, o secretário acusa o [Ibama ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/02/ibama-chega-aos-30-anos-sob-criticas-e-com-desafios-por-todo-o-pais.shtml)de perseguição. “O Ibama sempre teve um viés, tanto que o próprio [presidente foi multado pescando](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/03/ibama-exonera-servidor-que-multou-bolsonaro-por-pesca-irregular.shtml). Sempre teve essa fama de multar de graça”, diz Seif Junior.

 Além disso, o secretário questiona multas por pesca irregular feitas a partir de localização pelo GPS do barco. Estilo semelhante de fiscalização já ocorre e é considerado ideal, pelo ministro do Meio Ambiente, [Ricardo Salles](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/marceloleite/2019/03/ministro-cogita-criar-novo-sistema-de-desmatamento.shtml), e pelo presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL), para detectar e combater desmatamento.

 Seif Junior também responsabiliza os próprios pescadores por eventuais capturas proibidas. “Quem está olhando o peixe, se é proibido ou não, quem conhece a espécie, quem é especialista no trabalho, é ele [o pescador]. Se eu fosse o profissional ou meu pai fosse, quem estaria lá dentro do barco seríamos nós. A decisão é do pescador e ele tem que ser responsabilizado.”

 Segundo o secretário, crimes cometidos têm que ser punidos. “Você eventualmente comete infrações e vai ter que pagar por isso. Seja meu pai, minha mãe, meu papagaio, meu periquito, se cometeu alguma infração tem que pagar.”

 Contudo, a empresa da qual fazia parte recorreu de todas as multas, por considerá-las arbitrárias. “No [Ibama em breve serão canceladas centenas de multas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/02/ibama-deu-aval-sem-parecer-tecnico-a-nucleo-com-poder-de-anular-multas.shtml), como já dito publicamente pelo presidente da república e pelo Ricardo Salles, por essas covardias.”

 Seif Junior diz defender a proteção de peixes e da água, promete restabelecer, até o fim de 2019, a estatística pesqueira nacional —o último relatório é de 2011— e afirma que a revisão ou suspensão da lista de animais aquáticos ameaçados é uma das metas de sua gestão.",1556668989

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;A full-size long-range (265 miles per charge) BEV, with its larger battery, adds about six tons of emissions, which increases manufacturing emissions by 68 percent over the gasoline version. But this electric vehicle results in 53 percent lower overall emissions compared with a similar gasoline vehicle (see Figure ES-2). 

&gt;In other words, the extra emissions associated with electric vehicle production are rapidly negated by reduced emissions from driving. Comparing an average midsize midrange BEV with an average midsize gasoline-powered car, it takes just 4,900 miles of driving to “pay back”—i.e., offset—the extra global warming emissions from producing the BEV. Similarly, it takes 19,000 miles with the full-size long-range BEV compared with a similar gasoline car. 


&gt;Based on typical usages of these vehicles, this amounts to about six months’ driving for the midsize midrange BEV and 16 months for the full-size long-range BEV.﻿

And also- no one (unless they are in the transformation challenge) has had much body recomp or weight loss.. some have of course but most do not. Burn is the exact opposite! Everyone has results plus they do weekly focus meetings - weigh ins, inches and bf testing as well as nutrition plans.. and all this is included in membership and it’s still cheaper than otf! (And I have the unlimited founders rate with otf too)! 

I am actually thinking of freezing my otf for the summer and just stick with Burn.. maybe getting in one long run a week.. it’s seriously functional fitness - which is what F45 sounds like- at its very best!",1556668990

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","So you're a part of a religion where priests rape kids and buy multi-million dollar jets instead of helping the poor or doing anything good.  Your religious book is pro-slavery and super racist.  You follow the same god as the KKK does.  Numerous religious leaders are just complete sacks of shit and it's obvious.  

So why wouldn't you expect that people hate you for believing in the nonsense that you do and supporting the evil church that you do?  These people aren't living under a rock, they know the bullshit that their church and members pull.  If I supported such an organization I'd expect for people to throw feces at me in the streets.   

These are bad people and they want to be treated like the shit that they are.  Of course they complain about it, these people are pieces of shit.    They don't care about right and wrong they just want what they want and it doesn't matter who gets hurt or what life is made worse.

No really, if you support this religious obvious bullshit you're knowingly supporting horrific religious bullshit.  Why don't we treat them like the shit that they are constantly?  We're trying to be better and help them to be better.  This confuses the fuck out of them because they know that they wouldn't do the same thing in our place.",1556668992

Not that there is anything wrong with safe spaces though! I think I’m a lot like the twitter account dril when I troll the chuds. Have you heard of dril? That’s D-R-I-L.

Whoops sorry, I shouldn’t be using ableist words like dumb. How careless of me. Anywho, have you ever heard of a band called death grips? PRETTY PRETTY NINE MOTHERFUCKER! Haha that’s a death grip lyric reference. Whoops, now everyone is staring at me because I used my outside voice hehe. What’s that? You need to go to the bathroom?

It's July 20, but signup isn't even until June 1 so I have plenty of time to see how things are going (and it's a local race, even though top finishers run respectably at things like the Leadville 100, so it's cheap and I can back out even then). Didn't want to bore everyone with the details, but I'm basically doing two more miles for my long every other week, and the other week I go back down to just 10 mils (so I'm about at 40 mpw now, but will do 30 every other week, and max at maybe 48-50... the other variable are the incline workouts, which I hate but love). And it's really more time on trail for me, at least that's what worked for mountain obstacle course races, but regardless of mileage or time I am currently fine where I am. I said I agreed that I just want to finish, but it's not quite true... I want to also ""enjoy"" it (to the point that one enjoys challenging oneself) and so if I can't train pretty well I don't want to do it. I'm good with suffering during an event, but not SUFFERING, you know?(It boggles my mind that someone would try something without preparing, and not just for injury... you know it's gonna suck then.) So my finishing place doesn't matter as much as how the experience is, but obviously I'll just have to table it if scaling back to some cross training - along with the PT - doesn't keep me feeling right.

Anyway, again, thanks for the advice... it smells right. I'll scale back, try some new things, and then see what my PT says when it gets closer.",1556668992

Bungie could do it themselves or could hire someone else. If they really wanted, they could perhaps even headhunt some of the VV people to come work for them. 

At this point developing for consoles is basically the same as developing for PC, it’s really just a time thing and there are MANY options for Bungie on how to remedy that.",1556668994

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Alexandre Nardoni, 40, condenado a 30 anos e dois meses de prisão pelo assassinato da própria filha Isabella, em março de 2008, conseguiu da Justiça de São Paulo a progressão de regime e, assim, irá para o semiaberto.

 Isso significa que o bacharel em direito poderá trabalhar fora da prisão durante os dias da semana e, ainda, poderá deixar o presídio em cinco oportunidades ao longo do ano, nas chamadas “saidinhas”, em datas comemorativas como o Dia das Mães, Dia dos Pais e final do ano.

 No [presídio de Tremembé](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/08/em-prisao-de-famosos-em-sp-25-das-mulheres-sao-acusadas-de-matar-menor.shtml), onde está desde 16 de maio de 2008, Alexandre tem a possibilidade de trabalhar fora das grades, mas ainda no interior do presídio —há uma ala destinada a esse tipo de regime mais brando dentro do complexo. Ele também poderá pleitear a transferência para outra unidade no estado, mas isso ainda não foi decidido pela família Nardoni.

 A ordem judicial foi comunicada à direção do presídio ainda na tarde desta terça (30) e, assim, o criminoso deve ser enviado para o novo regime o quanto antes. Essa transferência pode, porém, demorar um pouco porque há necessidade de abertura de [vaga no sistema penitenciário](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2019/04/a-privatizacao-dos-presidios-e-uma-saida-para-a-crise-carceraria-sim.shtml).

 Alexandre não deverá ser liberado, porém, para deixar a prisão no Dia da Mães, no próximo mês, porque há um período de 30 dias de carência antes que o benefício possa ser usufruído. 

 Alexandre, assim como a mulher dele Anna Carolina Jatobá, 35, também condenada pela participação no crime, mantêm a versão de inocência.

 Segundo a acusação, o casal matou Isabella, de 5 anos, ao atirá-la pela janela do apartamento do pai, no sexto andar do edifício London, na zona norte da capital. Antes de arremessá-la pelo buraco da tela de proteção, porém, os dois teriam agredido a menina após discussão, ainda segundo a versão oficial.

 [A Promotoria não conseguiu apontar, porém, o motivo do assassinato.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/03/livro-aponta-uma-serie-de-falhas-na-apuracao-oficial-do-caso-isabella.shtml)

 Condenada a 26 anos e oito meses de prisão, Anna conseguiu o regime semiaberto ainda em 2017 e já deixou a prisão algumas vezes. O casal tem dois filhos, atualmente com 14 e 12 anos de idade.

 O advogado do casal, Roberto Podval, disse que não poderia comentar a decisão em razão do segredo de Justiça imposto ao processo. O Ministério Público de São Paulo disse que ainda não foi comunicado oficialmente da decisão, mas que, caso confirmada, irá recorrer.",1556668994

The USA has a ton of heavy oil demand that only continues to surge, especially with the shit in Venezuela right now and reduced exports from Mexico. 

But I've never seen anything talking about untapped refining capacity out there for heavy oils globally. Does China have a massive heavy-oil refining capacity? Somewhere else?

# NO Unauthorized Resellers

&gt; Games/items bought from unauthorized resellers are not allowed here. G2A and Kinguin are two examples of such sources that have a history of selling keys that get revoked later. One look at the recent posts in the [G2A subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/g2a/) should tell you everything you need to know about their legitimacy. [Here is a detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/wiki/dangersofkeyresellers) from /r/Steam and /r/GameDeals on this topic including, but not limited to, a list of authorized sources to buy games from. If someone wishes to try their luck with such websites despite all these warnings, that'd be their call, but know that anyone found selling games and items bought from such unauthorized retailers will be instantly banned here; whether this ban is temporary or permanent depends on how you handle the situation. 

&gt; In addition to checking the [price valuation wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/wiki/steamgamevaluation) and [our subreddit](https://rgameswap.com/#/steam) for past trades, these websites may be used to get a **rough idea** about the current market value of games. Posting links and advocating their use is however not allowed. 

&gt; If you're unable to provide a valid proof of purchase for your games/items when questioned, it will be automatically assumed that they come from an unauthorized reseller. This burden of proof lies on you; excuses such as ""my friend bought it for me from amazon, but deleted his email after giving me the code"" will not fly. If you can't prove that you bought it from a legitimate source, don't offer it here. If you ignore or evade a moderator's demand of proof of purchase, you will be banned from the subreddit until the issue is addressed.

###Please consider yourself warned, and become familiar with the [rules of this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/wiki/rules) Repeated violations will lead to the loss of posting privileges.

There are multiple avenues that the operator/ dispatcher (depending on how their roles are divided) could have pursued to determine the address of the caller. They could have replayed the 911 tape. They could have called the 911 caller back. They could have checked in house/ public records for the phone number. If it was a cell phone, they could have contacted the service provider and obtained subscriber information.

It gets busy sometimes and things can fall through the cracks, but given the nature of the call and the fact that two officers spent 30 minutes looking for the address I think more should have been done.

Edit: I skimmed the article and missed that the suspect called from a 911 phone. My other points still stand. If someone calls in reporting they're going to commit a murder and your officers can't find the address you better get a supervisor to pull the recording.",1556668995

Please avoid the anime adaptations of everything except Steins;Gate, Steins;Gate 0 and (*maybe*) Robotics;Notes.

Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child are incredible visual novels, just like Steins;Gate, but while S;G's anime is incredibly made and an incredibly faithful adaptation of its VN, C;H and C;C's anime adaptations are poorly-made and will only ruin your impressions of the original source material.

With that in mind, the release order for the series is:

* Chaos;Head (Noah)

* Steins;Gate

* Robotics;Notes

* Chaos;Child

* Steins;Gate 0

* Robotics;Notes DaSH

The chronological order, on the other hand (which most fans do not recommend) is:

* Chaos;Head (Noah)
 
* Steins;Gate

* Steins;Gate 0

* Chaos;Child

* Robotics;Notes

* Robotics;Notes DaSH

---

* **Chaos;Head** is fan-translated in English, but Chaos;Head Noah, the definitive edition, is not. Noah adds six new routes that answer a variety of unanswered questions from the original story. There is a fan translation of Noah in progress, but it is currently very difficult to predict when it might come out of hiatus.

Some readers are satisfied just fine with only Chaos;Head's main route and don't mind having to wait for Noah's translation, while other readers find themselves incredibly unsatisfied by the lack of explanations and find themselves waiting anxiously, or spoiling themselves using Google because they just can't wait any longer. 

Thus, whether you read Chaos;Head now or skip it and wait for Noah is up to you.

* **Robotics;Notes** is currently not translated in any form. In other words, the only way to experience it in English currently is by watching the anime, which is considered to be acceptable by some and lackluster by others.

If you would like to show your support for a localization of Robotics;Notes' visual novel, then you can check out Operation HiddenHand's petition, and follow Operation HiddenHand on Twitter for future updates.

https://www.change.org/p/spike-chunsoft-please-localize-robotics-notes-elite-for-english-audiences

https://twitter.com/ophiddenhand

Additionally, given that Robotics;Notes largely spoils the ending of Chaos;Head, it is recommended that, if you choose to temporarily skip Chaos;Head, you should also skip Robotics;Notes for now.

* **Chaos;Child** is the only non-Steins;Gate visual novel with an official localization. Though it is technically a sequel to Chaos;Head, no context from Chaos;Head is necessary to understanding the plot of Chaos;Child, though it may help you understand some aspects better and heighten your overall appreciation.

In other words, if you skip Chaos;Head, you can still read Chaos;Child just fine, though at a small disadvantage.

However, there are some issues with C;C's localization that very much bring down the experience when playing in English. To rectify these issues, it is recommended that you play on Steam and install the Committee of Zero patch to improve your experience.

You can find it here:

http://sonome.dareno.me/projects/chaoschild-steam.html

* **Steins;Gate 0** is the sequel (or ""interquel,"" to be more precise) to Steins;Gate, and unlike Chaos;Child is to Chaos;Head, 0 definitely requires that you have first completed the predecessor.

Unfortunately, a number of flaws prevent Steins;Gate 0's visual novel from being as complete as it could, and though many of these flaws are rectified by the anime adaptation, the anime also introduces a number of flaws that prevent it from being the definitive version.

Thus, unlike the original Steins;Gate where you're fine off reading *either* the visual novel *or* watching the anime, Steins;Gate 0 essentially requires you do both (preferably in the order of VN, then anime) for anything resembling a complete experience.

* **Robotics;Notes DaSH** is the latest (complete) title in the series, but considering that it just released in Japan in early 2019, with no anime currently confirmed, there is no way to experience it in English at the time. The best option is just to wait for this one.

* **Occultic;Nine** is in the unusual position of a title that was not originally a visual novel, but a light novel series. There is a visual novel version, but it is widely considered inferior to the original light novels. In addition, neither version of the story is complete, as the final volume of the light novel series has yet to release, and Occultic;Nine New World, an expansion for the visual novel that will add the proper ending, has also yet to release.

If you wish to read Occultic;Nine in spite of its incompleteness, however, the light novels are currently being published in English by J-Novel Club.

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","I’ve always loved the idea of that however there’s a few issues with doing this that can make it extremely annoying. 
1. KSP isn’t the most optimized game. Anything above 1000 parts can really start to drag your system down regardless of how powerful your computer is.
2. The Kraken likes big meals. It can often become the case (especially in large complex vehicles like what you’ve described) that the Kraken can attack for little reason and make your ship tear itself apart upon loading it up, making it unusable.
3. Any rovers, bases, relays, ect. that you want to take with you need to be onboard when launching, so if you find a flaw in a rover you already have 5 of, the whole lots gotta go and you need to go replace them. And also, vehicles often need special engineering depending on the celestial body you’re going to, do a craft that would work well on Duna could easily be too weak to land on Eve, or be too light on a smaller moon.

The kids and I walked six or eight blocks down the road to the local hospital.   I got the kids warmed up and they let me use their phone...but no one would give me a ride, not even the local cab service,  because my carseats were still in the broken-down car.

The lady at the front desk got ahold of a hospital volunteer.   This lady bought my kids a meal, took us home, and gave me a 20 as she left.

Awesome,  right?  But it gets better.

Did I mention how broke we were?  The kids were getting a few secondhand toys, but there was no money for presents.  This lady came back to our house, with bag after bag of stuff.  Groceries,  household necessities,  socks and gloves for the children...even nicely wrapped, new presents for the kids.  And a gas card for fifty bucks.

She had told me her husband had died recently,  and they had always done something nice for someone else around Christmas.   I still tear up thinking about it.",1556668999

Cerca de R$ 230 milhões foram contingenciados.

 **Mãos de tesoura 2** Várias unidades do país sofreram com o congelamento de valores previstos no orçamento de investimentos e outras despesas correntes, mas o volume da tesourada em três universidades chamou a atenção: a Federal da Bahia, a de Brasília e a Federal Fluminense.

 **Mãos de tesoura 3** De acordo com números preliminares, o valor bloqueado nas três entidades corresponde a mais da metade do contingenciamento imposto a todas as universidades. Procurado, o MEC informou que UFBA, UnB e UFF tiveram 30% das dotações orçamentárias bloqueadas.

 **Mãos de tesoura 4** Em nota, a pasta disse que “estuda os bloqueios de forma que nenhum programa seja prejudicado e que os recursos sejam utilizados da forma mais eficaz. O Programa de Assistência Estudantil não sofreu impacto em seu orçamento.”

 **Verão passado **Em 2018, a UFF foi palco de um rumoroso “ato contra o fascismo”, na reta final da eleição presidencial. Já a UnB foi palco recentemente de debates com Fernando Haddad (PT) e Guilherme Boulos (PSOL).

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","The ""failure to leave the field"" thing that the DisCo enjoys doing every week really needs to be revised for the VAR era. It's patently ridiculous to expect players to immediately leave the field when everyone, including the center ref, knows that there's going to be a minute or so of stoppage for the VAR to check the call. And if the VAR overturns the call and the player is already in the locker room so they avoid the fine, you then have to send someone to grab the player out of the hallway and wait for him to come back onto the field, adding even more stoppage for absolutely no gain. It's far more realistic to have the player wait until after the VAR check is complete to exit the field.

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt;TL;DR: English voice actors, by and large, do a good job, but the lack of VA diversity is extremely detrimental to the industry.

I agree, but I think 'vocal range' is possibly a better term - i.e., they can convey different characters/voices without instantly triggering the ""oh, that's Crispin Freeman"" response. (I watched Full Metal Panic before Full Metal Alchemist, and I couldn't unhear Vic Mignogna as the lecherous Kurz Weber from the former show every time Edward Elric opened his mouth.)

Problem is, there's not much voice acting talent in the US that's willing to work for what the dubbing companies are willing to pay - that's part of the reason long-time ENG anime VAs make an effort to build a personal brand and make money on the side by doing the convention circuit, and do video game and western cartoon VA work as well. It's a fairly small set of VAs, considering how much anime there is.

***

The big reason I prefer subs over dubs for everything except comedy (and that depends on the comedy) is that it brings a little more seriousness to not hear the dialogue in a language I understand. I can read awkwardly-worded subtitles and get the emotional information off a JP VA's voice. Hearing the same awkwardly-worded dialogue spoken aloud in English (particularly in the 'forced' tones some VAs slip into) can absolutely crack me up in the most serious scenes. And both abandoning honorifics completely in a dub script and hearing ENG VAs tack ""-senpai"" on the ends of names are just... unfortunate.

And that's all if the VAs and translation teams are doing a good job. There's just some stuff that doesn't translate well, and I'd prefer to read that instead of having to hear someone say it in English.",1556669000

Typically that will just deal with timing, whether you jump before or after the set.  

&amp;#x200B;

I do a lot of 2 and 3 step approaches as middle. I will typically do my approach to the setter and jump before reaching him, giving them about an arms length of space. 

If you like to hit 1s on the net, you typically give them the same amount of space they're off the net. IE: 2 ft from the net, you give aim to hit the ball 2ft from setter. 

In your case, I think you might be jumping too far forward. Aim to jump before the setter and give them some space. I personally would start farther back.",1556669000

You're absolutely wrong there, but I don't want to get sidetracked.

I understand what you're saying about unionism being unsupportive of it: nonetheless, the recent institutionalisation of Ulster Scots (and that's what I'm talking about in my comment -  which is different and wider than the dialect itself) happened more or less as I said, and it happened despite the lack of sincere support on the part of political unionism for the linguistic component. I'm clear on that.

I was replying to a comment made by another person. The Ulster Scots project is not the same thing as the dialect, which, as you say, is not unionist or nationalist. Most of the full speakers I know are Catholic and nationalist, though that's possibly a reflection of my own background. 

I don't doubt that there is worth in linguistic Ulster Scots and what I have a problem with is with the nebulous edifice that has been created that also bears the name, which also gives us the 'officialese' Ulster Scots which is often ridiculous and leaves the real and authentic spoken dialect open to undeserved mockery.

If you have never tried it you have to rely on others to believe in it. When you start to have some relief or shorter anxiety times, that's your first indication that what you're doing is helping.  

Hope lies in trying. Reach out to someone who can hold your hopes for a while.

Finger sandwiches are simple, pimento cheese spread, lunchmeat, cream cheese and olives, whatever kind you like. Over 21, bottle of cheap wine, under 21, empty wine bottle washed and filled with apple or grape cider. Potato salad if you like it, chips if you don't. Pie or cake for dessert, and voila!  Bonus points for doing it around sunset or midnight, watch the sunset or the stars while you eat and have nice cuddly time.

Walk on the beach. It's literally free. Grab buckets, collect shells or stones that you find along the way, then when you get home, do artsy things with them (the internet will be your inspiration, there are too many sea-gathered object art projects to list here).

Cook dinner together; spaghetti and garlic bread is a classic, and you don't have to be a 5 star chef to pull off something edible. Candles and nice china if you have it, or just more fairy lights and whatever regular dishes.

Go to the library, and each of you pick out a book for the other to read. Make a playlist of some of your favorite songs, and the  you'll have several dates- reading dates, then discussing both books dates.  Don't like to read? Pick a movie or TV series instead.",1556669002

Not to mention you had the color issue with Kofi which made so many of us want to see him win the belt because black individuals rarely get the big belt. Natalya is another white blonde woman who already held the biggest belt.

 I know you didn’t directly imply they were similar by the way so I’m not trying to jump on you for your comment. Just stating why in my opinion it wouldn’t work.

He could have picked up another shield by going to Wakanda to pick up some more vibranium then have Howard Stark make him a new one to go fight in the Cold War and then end up at the bed side of the Steve Rogers they found in the ice to tell him all about Thanos and prevent that Universe from going through the snap. After which he gets Tony and Bruce to build a new device to get him back to the Main Timeline using the GPS he used to get there a week before he left. Then watching himself time travel out goes and sits on the bench with the shield he used from the other universe.

In fact this is the only way this could have happened. There was only a limited number of shields made, all of which were accounted for before the final battle. The one the old Cap gave had to have come some place else because he didn't take one with him into the past.

A artista também apoiou o ex-presidente Lula em todas a eleições das quais participou, além de ter participado de festival que pedia a libertação do petista da prisão, no Rio, em julho de 2018.

 Ela Morreu nesta terça-feira (30), às 17h33, no Rio de Janeiro, aos 72 anos, em decorrência de infecção generalizada. Desde o início do ano, estava internada no Hospital Pró-Cardíaco. 

 Militante de esquerda, Beth também apoiava a causa dos MST e a candidatura da então candidata à presidência em 2010 Dilma Rousseff. Ela foi uma das artistas a se mostrar contra o impeachment da ex-presidente*, *em 2016.

 Ela chegou a participar de [um programa de TV comandado por ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mundo/ft2504200408.htm)[Chávez](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mundo/ft2504200408.htm) na Venezuela, que era transmitido pela TV estatal do país. Ela foi prestar ""solidariedade à revolução bolivariana"". O próprio ex-presidente do país chegou a dar uma palha na ocasião.

  

 ""Tinham me convidado para ser uma embaixadora informal da cultura entre Brasil e Venezuela. O Chávez ficou todo feliz com a história e perguntou: 'Ela pode fazer o programa Alô, Presidente para falar sobre isso?'. Então fiz o programa. Cantarolei a seco mesmo o samba 'Tristeza', enfim, tive uma ótima impressão do que está acontecendo, apesar do boicote da mídia, uma loucura. A briga lá está forte"", disse ela na ocasião.

 Na política, era apaixonada por Leonel Brizola, para quem gravou um jingle em 2000, quando o ex-governador do Rio de Janeiro se candidatou a prefeito da capital fluminense.

Bran is impossible to read these days. Never shows any emotion at all. For the most part he appears to only use exactly the number of words he needs to get his chess pieces to move into position. Even the NK neatly played right into Bran's plan. I could certainly see his end-game being completely different from everyone else's.

If not, and the battle at King's Landing is really all that is left, then it hardly seems like a fair fight. Bran will give just the right person exactly the right item/motivation they end up needing when they reach a pivotal moment.

"dpdr","t5_2sv5a","I’m really sorry that this is happening to you, I lived through this for a year when I was 14/15 and it truly was the worst time of my life, the constant feeling of dread and dark black terror and fear of never returning to normal and of being trapped in that state and insane, not able to think of anything else other then trying to fight off the next panic attack, which was always on the verge of hitting and could launch into full scale at any given moment. I felt detached from reality, slow and foggy and like I had half left my body but still half attached, trapped in some in between reality where all I could do was go through the pointless repetitive motions of life and wait for myself to return to normal. I took myself to the emergency room a few times and nobody would ever help me, they just kept saying it was an anxiety attack and told me ways to breathe and relax. I was so far past breathing and positive quotes. My family were ashamed of me and refused to accept that I had severe mental health issues and also none of these things were mainstream and well known back at the time. I didn’t know what anxiety was and basically I just hid away for that year. I left school, never went anywhere because of the constant fear of detachment from reality and an anxiety attack. I wish I had a miracle cure to give up because I know that’s what I was searching for. I desperately wanted someone to fix me, to tell me I just had to do this or that and it would stop or to give me some miracle medication or some procedure that would end it all. I didn’t recover until I let go of these ideas and I had a massive breakthrough, where it really really got through to me that nobody could help me, nobody could give me some magical cure, the only one that could help me was myself. I’m honestly not sure if this thing just ‘ran its natural course’ and stopped by itself or whether it went away because I drastically had to fight it and change the entire way my thinking and brain worked. Part of it for me was learning to let go of the need to control it, when I tried to stop the attacks and the feelings, they seemed to escalate until I was completely out of control and this cause further anxiety and panic. I developed a way to allow the adrenaline surges to occur and tried not to fight it and just tell myself it’s only a chemical in my body and that I don’t need to react to it and I just need to sit with it and through it. It wasn’t as simple as it sounds typing it all out here, I feel like I am probably only making this sound less hopeful for you, but hopefully now in this day and age when we know there are names for these things and that they are actually a ‘thing’, u can get proper help from a psychiatrist and/or psychologist and you can get some better coping tools and mechanisms than what I had. One good thing about it is that for all the stories I have heard of people suffering through this, they seem to only last a year or few years at max, I haven’t ever read of anyone who has had to perpetually live in this acute state for the rest of their lives.",1556669007

I would try to talk to her about it, say that she is being unfair in making this about herself and portraying herself as the victim.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","I think if you asked 100 people that question you would get very different answers.
I think it's a vague term. 

I think it's divisive, and only contributes to simplify a complex situation and further polarize us all while putting widely different people and opinions into narrow boxes. 

And see, in your post you already put me in a box, without knowing anything about me except this single comment of mine you saw today.

This type of modern political language and thinking is just holding us back, I think.

It just contributes to lazy binary thinking. Left/Right. Red/Blue etc.. 
Sure, it's mentally convenient and easy, but it feels like those cognitive shortfalls are having a pretty severe effects on our society. Which is of course magnified today by how connected we are on the internet. 

And I'm saying this from a human-centric perspective. It's way above ideologies and political leanings, because it's actually holding our species back from advancing. 

I hope you don't take this as personal criticism, cause it's really just about the subject, which I also find interesting. 
I wonder if humanity is prone to this kind of thinking, maybe it's a byproduct of how our brains work.

"goodyearwelt","t5_2w64o","&gt;How best to combat heel slip? I've tried tongue pads and orthotics. While my two feet are nearly the same Brannock size, my right foot's heel is substantially smaller than the left as is it's instep. While the tongue pads keep the right heel back, I can feel it rattling side-to-side and my ankle pronating.

&amp;#x200B;

Try heel pads for this.  It should fill some of the lateral space.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When standing, how much room should be in front of my little toes? I notice almond shaped lasts tend to squeeze the pinky toe on my left foot... Possibly because I sized too small... I can still slip an index finger behind the heel, but I feel like that's making my toes compress or squeeze together to move forward in the shoe.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't want your toes squeezed together, that's not good for your feet.  The length in front of your toes doesn't matter and will vary depending upon the nature of the last.  I have some shoes with minimal room and others where I need to be pretty careful not the ding the toe because they are longer than most.  Both pairs fit correctly.  Judge correct length by the flex point of the shoe which should generally be at the widest part of shoe.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If I feel a bit of pressure from the quarter on my left inside instep when trying shoes on in the store, I'm guess that means I need to size up? (either width or length)

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe?  I have a high instep as well.  Some shoes just don't work for me but you can try other sizes and see if a wider width or longer shoe will solve the issue.  It might or it might cause other fit issues.  Try it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fool proof way to tell if heel-to-ball length is correct? I've tried on the same last in various sizes and always thought, yeah the widest part of my shoe is roughly aligned with the ball... Just seems hard to tell...

&amp;#x200B;

Ok this is redundant with what I said above.  At the end of the day, you have been wearing shoes your whole life.  Don't over complicate things.  In general, you usually just know if it's right.  There are unfortunately occasions where it might seem good on a quick fitting but ends up being less ideal once you are wearing them for a full day.  This is usually because of your feet swelling at different times or other reasons.  If it's an expensive pair and you want to be sure that you have nailed it then consider multiple fittings if possible to confirm your size.",1556669008

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Passou um quarto de século, mas [Ayrton Senna](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2014/05/1447793-confira-uma-selecao-de-frases-de-ayrton-senna.shtml) continua sempre presente quando se fala de F-1 no Brasil. E isso é facilmente explicável, embora, em minha opinião, advenha de uma abordagem errada do esporte em si.

 A Globo, [identificando Ayrton no “herói brasileiro”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2018/10/ha-30-anos-senna-conquistava-1o-titulo-e-status-de-heroi-com-vitoria-epica.shtml), com direto a musiquinha e elogios de todos seus narradores e comentaristas, tornou o excelente piloto um verdadeiro ídolo popular. A ponto de, [com seu prematuro desaparecimento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2014/ayrtonsenna/), a atenção para a F-1 ter assinalado uma brutal queda de audiência.

 Uma queda, diga-se, que não se verificou em outros países, onde a atenção para o esporte a motor independe da presença ou não de um piloto local que possa ser campeão.

 Para um exemplo claro, basta lembrar a Itália, onde os GPs têm boa audiência (uns mais, outros menos, dependendo das mais diversas circunstâncias) embora seu último campeão mundial da categoria tenha sido o falecido Alberto Ascari e sua Ferrari, nos anos 1952 e 1953. Há 66 anos!

 Ou então a Alemanha, onde a F-1 sempre teve boa audiência, embora seu primeiro campeão mundial, Michael Schumacher, tenha aparecido apenas em 1994, com a equipe Benetton.

 Em minha opinião (e debati este ponto de vista muitas vezes com meus bons colegas do SporTV, quando lá trabalhei) o erro da direção da Globo foi acreditar que o Brasil sempre teria um campeão mundial.

 Com efeito, a saga de ótimos pilotos, iniciada lá atrás com Chico Landi, teve Emerson Fittipaldi, Carlos Pace, Nelson Piquet (para lembrar apenas os mais famosos) e chegou a seu ápice com Ayrton Senna. 

 Quando ele desapareceu tragicamente em Ímola, a Globo apostou todas suas fichas em Rubens Barrichello, um ótimo piloto, mas não à altura de Senna. E isso, por sinal, prejudicou a história de Barrichello aqui no Brasil. Embora, lá fora, não lhe tenha trazido problema algum, pois tanto críticos como o grande público europeu não embarcaram nesse julgamento.

 Para mim, colocar Ayrton Senna num hipotético pódio de todos os tempos é bastante fácil. Com a premissa que esse julgamento começa com o início do Campeonato Mundial, em 1950, quando já tinha condições de analisar as corridas de uma forma profissional, sem o entusiasmo do menino que, levado pelas mão do pai, ia a Monza ver Nuvolari e os outros grandes pilotos de antes da 2ª Guerra Mundial.

 Aí o julgamento seria influenciado pela paixão e —provavelmente— não teria o equilíbrio que julgo ter alcançado.

 Feita essa premissa, de que me limito a levar em consideração apenas os GPs dos últimos 70 anos, o melhor piloto que vi foi, sem dúvida, o argentino [Juan Manuel Fangio.](https://acervofolha.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2018/02/23/ha-60-anos-fangio-foi-sequestrado-por-guerrilheiros-cubanos/)

 [Ele ganhou cinco títulos mundiais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1995/7/18/esporte/16.html) com as mais diversas marcas, desde Alfa Romeo em 1951, passando por Mercedes em 1954 e 1955, continuando com Ferrari em 1966 e encerrando com Maserati em 1957.

 É nesse último campeonato que eu encontro o grande diferencial de Fangio, pois ele levantou a taça com um carro que era inferior à Ferrari. E teve, no GP da Alemanha, a 4 de agosto de 1957 no tradicional circuito de Nurburgring, aquele que ele mesmo reconheceu, falando comigo anos depois, como a maior atuação de sua carreira.

 Recorde-se que ele tinha pela frente o esquadrão da Ferrari, que contava com pilotos de alto nível como Mike Hawthorn, Peter Collins, Luigi Musso (que se classificaram em 2º, 3º e 4º lugares, ratificando a excelência do carro).

 Logo após Fangio, porém, eu coloco —empatados— Ayrton Senna e Jim Clark.

 Ayrton venceu em todas as condições, seco ou molhado, e correndo por várias equipes, desde a modesta Toleman Hart, passando depois para a Lotus até chegar ao ápice com a Mclaren Honda, onde formou excepcional dupla com Alain Prost e ganhou três títulos mundiais. Mas sempre, é bom lembrar para estabelecer a diferença com Fangio, tendo o melhor carro.

 Para o britânico Jim Clark, que em toda sua carreira só dirigiu Lotus, ficam 2 títulos mundiais e um triunfo nas 500 Milhas de Indianápolis. Mas, acima disso, a constatação de que, mesmo quando pilotava um carro inferior ao dos adversários, conseguia mostrar toda sua classe.

Me and my boyfriend went thru something similar (he struggled for jobs bc he is not a US citizen) but every single time I got an offer he was so purely happy and supportive for me. He felt sad for his situation but didn't take it out on me or my success, which was so important.(Happy ending: we're both in Big4 Companies now and I envy his skills so much)",1556669011

My family doesn't and my own brother who has ocd (just a different kind then mine) doesn't either...I have had panic disorder, anxiety, depression and OCD and at one point agoraphobia since I was 14. I am now almost 40. My boyfriend of over a year doesn't understand most of my mental illnesses but he is there to be supportive. He has said I don't know what to do to help you and I just said listen and don't judge. In time you will get over the embarrassment and learn it's not you, it's that there is a chemical imbalance in your brain. There are strategies you can learn to cope and educating yourself can help. I used to be ashamed of it but now I just call it out when it happens. Sorry I'm freaking out, nope not gonna do that. I found the more I kept it inside the bigger it got. You are right to keep pushing yourself even though it is hard. It does get easier the more you push yourself. I understand that you are feeling useless and a burden but you have to understand it is not your fault, you are not fully in control.

Since you offered the service for free, I’m not sure if this is a viable option, but this is quite close to blackmail. Unfortunately, if you’re not a registered business, you won’t be able to. But legal zoom can get you an LLC for like $150. I’d spend the money on that rather than sucking up to someone with 4 horses that can’t afford to have them prepared for a SHOW.

First, Steve's shield broke apart in chunks, as opposed to the vision, where his shield is shown to be broken more or less in half.

But that's a minor detail, more importantly there are several parts of the vision that would've been impossible by that point of the movie. Natasha couldn't have been dead on the ground, because she was already dead on a distant planet in an alternate timeline. The Chitari wouldn't be flying away into a wormhole to reach Earth, because the battle took place on Earth, so they'd be flying towards Tony, not away.

And of course, if Tony hadn't stolen the Infinity Stones, everyone would've been dusted, (*everyone* including the Chitari) so that situation couldn't have happened, because nothing would happen, because there'd be nothing left to happen.

Most importantly Steve would never have said ""You could've saved us."" He wouldn't put the blame on Tony. If it was a real vision of a possible future he would've said something more along the lines of ""We could've done more.""",1556669013

Some popular fits off the top of my head that you could check out: Left Field's Atlas Cut, N&amp;F's Easy Guy, Oni's 902zr and 622zr, LSG's Brunswick, and most of TCB's cuts (mostly Levi's &amp; Lee reproductions). Additionally, Studio D'Artisans 40th Anniversary and FoxFibre jeans will almost all be in a ""relax tapered"" fit. Other things to keep in mind when picking out a pair are rise and hem measurements, fabric type, and construction details. There are honestly so many choices, choosing a pair that fits can be harder than finding a pair that fits - which is why I think so many people end up with a lot of pairs. Most important part is to do your research so that your choice doesn't bite you in the ass. I thought I could use a higher rise until I ended up with a pair of 902zrs that fit terribly.

 Sem transmissão de TV, a partida entre CSA e [Palmeiras](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/palmeiras/), nesta quarta-feira (1º), só poderá ser acompanhada pelos torcedores por meio das redes sociais dos dois clubes, uma rádio de São Paulo e rádios de Alagoas. O duelo vai ocorrer no estádio Rei Pelé, em Maceió, pela segunda rodada da [Série A do Brasileiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2019/campeonato-brasileiro/serie-a/).

 A partida não terá exibição pela televisão porque cada clube acertou com uma emissora diferente os direitos de transmissão na TV fechada de seus compromissos pelo Nacional.

 O time alviverde tem [contrato com o canal TNT, do grupo Turner,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/04/com-estreia-do-palmeiras-tnt-tem-quase-o-dobro-de-audiencia-do-sportv.shtml) enquanto a equipe alagoana fechou com o Grupo Globo. Dessa forma, o duelo não poderá ser transmitido por TNT ou SporTV e nem mesmo pelo pay-per-view, já que o Palmeiras também não fechou com esse serviço.

 Sem o acordo, 26 jogos do Palmeiras no campeonato —contra os 13 times que assinaram com a Globo— podem ficar sem transmissão na TV. Esse será o primeiro deles.

 Segundo a Lei Pelé, [uma partida só pode ser exibida com a anuência dos dois times participantes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/04/procon-notifica-operadoras-de-tv-a-cabo-sobre-transmissoes-do-brasileiro.shtml). No pay-per-view, [o apagão pode chegar a 74 jogos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/04/veja-data-e-horarios-dos-jogos-sem-transmissao-de-tv-no-brasileiro.shtml), já que por enquanto nem Athletico-PR nem Palmeiras fecharam acordo para ter seus jogos exibidos nesse serviço.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","No worries man. For what you say, nvidia is probably the best option, since some of those games are optimised for their cards (like AC). Still a vega 56 is no joke, but as I read from some user, they need ""some love"".  

Now, it depends on how much you want to spend and if you want to play at max settings. Since you are only aiming for 75hz instead of 144hz, it also depends on if you are willing to reduce some settings to balance things or not. If not, the best option would be a 2070, which should run everything at high-max settings. If you are willing to do it, a vega 56 or an rtx2060 are your best options. The problem with vega is that its price varies depending on how much stock is left in each store. I've seen Sapphire Pulse vegas ramp up over 600-700€ in some countries/shops and in others (such as Spain, where I live) be as low as 300-320€. I would buy it if it's cheaper than a rtx2060 and from the rtx2060, I would go for some of the best version, such as the msi gaming Z or the Zotac AMP (this one is not that expensive as some other models).

One important remark would be the fact that the rtx have ray tracing and dlss, which may interest you, or may not. But the dlss may prove useful for 1440p gaming if you happen to play some game that implements it.

In case you want more information about the vega 56, maybe check some updated benchmarks or ask in r/amd, just remember that it consumes more power, so  you may need a new psu for using it, which would increase the price (if you buy it, replace the psu cables, reusing them may fry your pc) or if you live in a country where electricity is expensive, it may increase your bill quite a lot if you play a lot of hours

Edit: I forgot to mention it, but you may also be interested in getting some used 1080 or 1080ti, though I never recommend it myself because I never liked buying second hand things. If you are interested, check r/hardwareswap",1556669015

Also, dildo isn’t the same as a vibrator you maniac... dildo penetrates, and that could cause damage. Vibrator doesn’t penetrate. Why are you even discussing this question if you can’t tell the difference between sex toys?",1556669016

One last try.

When people discuss ""loot boxes"", they do so with the background of corporate greed and microtransactions. The 'loot boxes' in MK11 (yes, there are boxes of loot, albeit not fully random, but rather predetermined for all players, and simply location-swapped per player, thus everyone gets the same rewards) are not guarded behind microtransactions. Money cannot be used to attain them.

So yes, you could theoretically argue that they maintain the spirit of greedy evil corporations by providing players with a dopamine hit that could potentially be seen as exploitative, but again, real money is not involved in the attainment of these boxes, and whether or not people unlock them makes no monetary difference to the company.

It's... not a metaphor. Allegory, if anything. That being said, original sin isn't an 'inciting incident' or a specific moment, but rather the 'endemic sin', the sin that is just part of humanity as is. 

What's the special property of a specific incident that makes 'original sin' as a concept more real or needing of Jesus as opposed to the time when people would actually be able to choose to do 'wrong'. What's a literal stain, anyway? A birthmark?",1556669018

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A cantora Beth Carvalho[ morreu nesta terça (30), aos 72 anos de idade, no Rio de Janeiro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2019/04/cantora-beth-carvalho-morre-no-rio-aos-72-anos.shtml). A Madrinha do Samba, como era chamada, vem recebendo diversas homenagens nas redes sociais, tanto de companheiros de profissão e admiradores como dos times de futebol e da escola de samba com os quais ela tinha ligação.

 Beth, que morreu em decorrência de uma infecção generalizada, estava internada no Hospital Pró-Cardíaco desde o início do ano.

 Aberto aos fãs, o velório da cantora será realizado nesta quarta (1º), a partir das 10h, no salão nobre da sede do Botafogo, na avenida Venceslau Brás, 72, Rio de Janeiro. Às 16h o corpo seguirá em cortejo para o crematório do Caju, onde ocorrerá cerimônia apenas amigos e familiares.

 ​Caetano Veloso publicou um vídeo no Twitter, dizendo que Beth Carvalho foi ""uma das maiores maravilhas do Brasil"". ""Ela se tornou a madrinha do renascimento do samba no Rio de Janeiro. Uma das maiores expressões da nossa cultura. Tenho saudades dela"".

  

Uma das primeiras pessoas a se manifestar, Gal Costa foi a Twitter para lamentar a morte da cantora. “Muita tristeza com a partida da amiga e colega Beth Carvalho. Que toda a família tenha o conforto da fé. Muita tristeza!”, ela escreveu.

  

No Instagram, a Estação Primeira de Mangueira, pela qual Beth Carvalho desfilava há 50 anos, resgatou uma foto dela no aniversário de 90 anos da escola de samba. “Um dos mais importantes nomes do samba e voz que cantava com alma as cores de nosso pavilhão, Beth nos deixou esse belo registro, no aniversário de 90 anos da sua amada Estação Primeira de Mangueira, no Palácio do Samba”.

 À GloboNews, o cantor Marinho da Vila disse que Beth foi uma de suas ""maiores intérpretes"".

 Veja abaixo outras homenagens a Beth Carvalho:

 Gilberto Gil, músico, no Twitter

 ""O samba está de luto! Com muita dor no coração que eu falo assim, mas Deus sabe o que faz, a gente não sabe o que fala. Que vá com Deus e com os anjos. São os meus sentimentos.""

  

​Elza Soares, cantora, no Twitter

 ""O samba está de luto! Com muita dor no coração que eu falo assim, mas Deus sabe o que faz, a gente não sabe o que fala. Que vá com Deus e com os anjos. São os meus sentimentos.""

  

Daniela Mercury chamou Beth de inspiração e amiga: “Você é o samba que nos inspira a resistir, que canta o Brasil mais profundo. Com você vai um pouco de mim, de nós, do Brasil. Conosco fica a sua voz, a sua luta, a sua música. Tudo é eterno na sua arte. Estou imensamente triste com sua partida. Te amo!”

 Marcelo D2 escreveu que Beth foi a primeira artista que ele viu os pais ouvindo em casa. “Vai deixar saudade, mas sua obra fica”, completou, agradecendo a cantora e citando um trecho da letra da música “Tesoura Cega”.

  

 O perfil oficial da roda de samba do Cacique de Ramos, com a qual Beth era identificada, publicou um tributo à cantora:

 Regina Casé, atriz e apresentadora, no Instagram

 ""Ela amou o samba como poucos, o Fogão, o Rio, o Brasil como poucos.... Muito amor! Vai Beth Carvalho... Vai ficar um pouquinho de você na tamarineira do Cacique, um pouco em General Severiano, um tanto na Ilha de Maré, um tantinho no espaço sideral cantando 'Ô coisinha tão bonitinha...'""

 Beth também foi lembrada pelo Botafogo, seu time de futebol do coração. “Nossa eterna Madrinha, obrigado por tudo”, publicou o clube carioca nas redes sociais. O Atlético-MG também citou o “segundo hino” do time, referindo-se à música “Vou Festejar”, eternizada na voz da cantora e tradicionalmente entoada pela torcida do clube mineiro.

 O Governo do Estado do Rio de Janeiro emitiu uma nota de pesar. “Lamento profundamente a morte de Beth Carvalho, uma das melhores e mais importantes cantoras do nosso país”, diz o comunicado, assinado pelo governador Wilson Witzel. “Seus sambas embalaram da minha infância até os dias de hoje. Na sua longa e bem sucedida carreira musical, essa grande intérprete do samba carioca reuniu, ao longo de cinco décadas, fãs de todas as idades, unindo o país em torno da beleza da sua voz e das suas canções.”

 Witzel ainda escreveu que o Estado do Rio de Janeiro “ficou mais triste” e se solidarizou com os amigos e familiares da cantora.

 Marcelo Crivella, prefeito do Rio, também divulgou uma nota. “Beth Carvalho eternizou alguns dos momentos mais belos da música brasileira. Sua voz suave, em mais de 50 anos de carreira, nos deixou interpretações inesquecíveis de Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho e outros tantos mestres. Generosa, era chamada de Madrinha do Samba por incentivar jovens talentos que vieram a se consagrar. Hoje, o Rio entardeceu triste, mas, como Beth ensinou, iremos achar o tom. Neste momento de tristeza, saudade e dor, peço a Deus que conforte sua família e legião de amigos e fãs.”

 O deputado federal Marcelo Freixo e o candidato a presidente na última eleição, Guilherme Boulos, ambos do PSOL, falaram sobre a sambista no Twitter. “Beth sempre foi uma artista gigantesca, intérprete maravilhosa que colocou seu canto à disposição dos sonhos por um mundo mais justo e solidário”, publicou Freixo.",1556669020

Languages like Hindi, English, etc. I believe might be considered an Indian Lingua Franca ie. you can speak them in any area within India and at least someone will understand you to a basic degree.

"linuxmasterrace","t5_2ykcc","A. Overhead is insignificant compared to Windows, e.g.; keeping the PC turned on 12 months generate no performance drop from keeping it on (uptime), and no performance drop from the time passed since installation (no OS ""autodestruction""). I don't know why, but after some years of Linux, I think it's normal, how it's supposed to be, really.

Performance drop because of added features is not a very common thing, as well. Some distros are more bloated, but if you get a performance drop, more likely it's because of a bug introduced somewhere that will get fixed, not because of fancy animations and stuff. Updates instead tend to improve performance. Take video drivers, for example, in the last couple of years AMD drivers inside the kernel got much better.

A. No, it's more secure, because in the mean time some security fixes may appear. You should get the supported versions from the official site and update the OS after installing, not install a 12 months old version of it.

I have the 1080p amazon version and while it was dark it was definitely still fairly good quality.  Definitely not insane pixelation like that.

However, when they stream an episode so dark, the bitrate needs to be increased.  Otherwise the compression algorithms thinks all those dark colors are the same and you get that block-y banding from your screens.

Heres some random screens I took of the file I have, uploaded to an uncompressed filehost.

YTA because it seems like you shamed your daughter for beginning to explore her sexuality, which is absolutely normal at her age, and which she was also doing with what she understood to be explicit permission from her mum. Also, isn't if better she starts to explore with toys on her own, than potentially putting herself in unsafe situations with other people?

However, I also think your wife is also the AH. She should have had this discussion and came to a consensus with you way before this even came up, so that when it came time to talk to your 12yo about it, you had a decision in place and could present a united front. There's always the possibility your daughter asked her not to, as she was embarrassed and felt more comfortable talking to her female parent about it.  But it doesn't mean the two if you couldn't have talked about it behind closed doors, and then had mom only do the talking to daughter to make her more comfortable.",1556669025

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Uma ação de guardas municipais e policiais militares na região da Cracolândia, no centro de São Paulo, causou uma dispersão de usuários de droga pela região, na tarde desta terça-feira (30). Houve correria, depredação e disparo de bombas de efeito moral. 

 Temendo invasões, estabelecimentos comerciais baixaram as portas mais cedo do que o costume. Usuários chegaram a entrar em uma loja da rede de supermercados Dia, levando itens como carrinhos de compras e escadas. Segundo vizinhos, a loja estava sendo desmontada e já não tinha produtos nas prateleiras. 

 Segundo moradores locais, os confrontos estão ocorrendo desde cerca de 12h30. A polícia usou bombas de efeito moral para tentar dispersar os usuários.

 No início da tarde, um caminhão da concessionária Enel (que substituiu a Eletropaulo) foi depredado na rua Helvétia. O veículo estava atuando no reforço da rede elétrica da região que recebeu 914 apartamentos nos últimos anos, fruto de uma parceria público-privada que pretende revitalizar a região.

 A GCM diz ter sido alvo de disparos de arma de fogo e chamou equipes táticas da Polícia Militar. 

  Os confrontos se prolongaram pela tarde, quando houve mais disparos de bombas de efeito moral e mais correria. Alguns usuários de droga chegaram a chutar carros que passavam pela avenida Duque de Caxias. Motoristas passavam acelerando seus veículos para intimidar os que estavam sobre a pista. 

 A Polícia Militar teve que bloquear vários acessos à região, incluindo um quarteirão inteiro da avenida Rio Branco, ao lado do terminal Princesa Isabel. Ônibus de diversas linhas não conseguiram iniciar ou terminar suas viagens. Os bloqueios causaram trânsito às ruas dos Campos Elíseos e da Santa Ifigênia. 

 A Guarda Civil Metropolitana também recomendava aos pedestres da região que contornassem a área do conflito. O confronto se estendeu pelo horário de saída das crianças das escolas da região. “Eu tenho medo de levar bomba e nem saber o porquê”, disse Bruno Rodrigues, que buscava o filho de 3 anos da escola enquanto viaturas corriam pelas ruas do centro.

 Uma moradora da região diz que PMs entraram no bar que fica dentro de sua casa e reviraram os utensílios. “Eles não têm mandado, não têm nada. Para eles, todos nós que moramos aqui somos lixo”, diz ela que vende salgados e macarrão perto do fluxo de consumo de drogas.

 Usuários de droga dizem terem ter sido cercados por guardas civis e policiais militares enquanto fugiam das bombas.

 Segundo a GCM, dois homens foram presos à tarde, após disparos feitos contra a guarda. Um deles estaria carregando um revólver calibre 32. Foram encaminhados ao Denarc (Departamento Estadual de Prevenção e Repressão ao Narcotráfico). 

 Em nota, a Secretaria de Segurança Pública do Estado de São Paulo não comentou o que motivou a operação e se houve algum detido ou a apreensão de drogas ou armas. Diz apenas que foi acionada para apoiar uma operação da GCM. ""A instituição adota estratégias para contenção de distúrbios e ações de quebra da ordem"", diz a nota.

 No início da noite, usuários de droga voltaram a consumir crack na alameda Cleeveland, tradicional ponto de consumo da droga na região.",1556669025

"golf","t5_2qhcs","I played 3 rounds over the weekend in Palm Springs: [Palm Desert Greens](http://www.pdgcc.com) on Friday, and 36 holes on the Marriott Desert Springs [Valley](https://www.marriott.com/golf-hotels/ctdca-jw-marriott-desert-springs-resort-and-spa/desert-springs-golf-club/5224641/valley-course.mi) and [Palm](https://www.marriott.com/golf-hotels/ctdca-jw-marriott-desert-springs-resort-and-spa/desert-springs-golf-club/5224641/palm-course.mi) courses on Saturday.

**Palm Desert Greens** is a private executive-like 18 hole course in a retirement community. Nearly everyone we met on the course was at least 30 years older than me, but the course still played really well.  The back tees (white) ended up having lots of 200y+ par 3 holes which tested my mid and log irons. Everything was in superb condition, the greens were very true but slower than you'd expect for how well manicured they were, which actually made it more fun to play.  I made 5-over 65.

**Best shot:** Best stretch I had was 7 holes while I was leading a conference call, went 1-over!

**Shot I'd like to have back:** I would have gone even during my call if not for a 3-putt while wrapping things up..

**Marriott Desert Springs** courses were also in fantastic condition (minus the hard bunkers). The greens were true and quite fast, the wind wasn't bad, and the cart girl was hustling. The Valley course is quite a bit shorter, but has trickier tiered and turtle back greens. The Palm course had water in play on nearly every hole.  The weather was hot, the Stagecoach pool party was rocking, and we had spectators cheering and talking shit from the 4-5 story resort which lined most fairways. Made 82-84 despite playing 36 in 105F heat and copious amounts of alcohol.

**Best shot:** 175y 8i with wind at my back onto the top tier of a green to ~4ft **while** 3 dudes were trying to razz from their 4th floor balcony.  (Apparently it's never OK to wear all white, even in 105F weather..)  After I saw the ball stop next to the hole I gave them a double bicep flex and some choice words, to which they responded by tossing us a few cold beers which we all shotgunned together.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I hate the concept of idling games, but Ima be a hypocite and recommend my favourite.

I like the Logistial series, it's a puzzle (ish) game where you have to ship supplies to real world towns.  

One of these games, Logistical Brazil, is an idling game.  The rules are the same, but all towns have 0 consumption so there's no impetus.  You just set up your trucks and watch it go...

....

...and I currently have 3200 hours on it and am only 5% done.

While I play active games with intent, I like the ""screensaver"" aspect of some idling games when I just want something to watch/ignore or listen to while I'm doing some other task.  For example, I leave Brazil running when I'm playing Grim Dawn or Dota or when painting Warhammer.

So my personal metric for success with an idling game is how well it works as a screensaver.  This is one reason I don't care too much for Clicker Heroes or AdVenture Capitalist - you have to play them with intent and then get grumpy waiting for the next benchmark to happen.  I don't want statistical manager, I want an Ant Farm.

Another idle game that I like is ProgressQuest.  You literally do nothing... but it's fun to take a peek at what items your dude has.",1556669026

Girls may have their own ways of bullying each other, but that is particular to boys/men.

I feel like I'm the only who isn't too bothered by the idea of a half-human Doctor and it is a part of my personal canon.

Due to the show not screwing with the idea too much I'm able to head canon it this way:

The Doctor exhibits at least an academic interest in Earth and humans when he is there as the First Doctor. This is seen in things like him stating the French Revolution is his favorite period of Earth history. The First Doctor and Susan have some familiarity with the planet due to their family connection to it. Which may explain why they choose it to hide from the Time Lords, because they felt like they that familiarity, at least in a very academic sense, would help them more.

That is the extent of it. The actual emotional and passionate attitudes the Doctor develops for Earth and humans comes from his time with Ian and Barbara. They made him more ""human,"" not his biology.

Regardless of his genetics the Doctor is a Time Lord through and through. The Doctor was raised in Time Lord society and culture and nothing else. The Doctor is ostracized but never not seen as a Time Lord. The Doctor exhibits the privilege, emotions, attitudes, mental skills, intellect, and philosophy of Time Lords. The Doctor is a Time Lord and nothing else. Also I just assume Time Lord genes are dominate to any other species they breed with.

People talk about how they think being half-human ruins the character. I think it depends on how it is handled. I think looms and being the reincarnated Other ruins the character more than being half-human.",1556669028

It's a really ugly ""purity check"" that's come up on this subreddit over the last 4 or 5 months.

Any time Corbyn comes up, and someone makes a reasonable statement about feeling frustrated or disillusioned by the Labour party, you'll get a bunch of people aggressively taking them to task and suggesting they're either propagandists, or ""not real leftists"".

Apparently the only acceptable left wing view is going forward with Brexit, sacrificing the poorest and youngest in the country, and hoping that from the ashes Corbyn and Labour will be in power, and have the political capital to introduce sweeping socialist policy that makes the UK more equal.",1556669028

I understand your knee-jerk overreaction. As parents it weirds us out to think of our kids as sexual beings. But adolescents masturbate. It's what they do. I did my share and I'm sure you did too. Trying to keep them from doing it is just going to give them a complex about it. A better conversation might revolve around boundaries and privacy and maybe don't surf that shit in the living room where your dad can see it.

NOW THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY:

The way your wife handled this is super fucked up. She totally threw you under the bus and undermined your authority with your daughter. She should have spoken to you privately and then the two of you could speak to your daughter together presenting a united front. I don't blame you at all for being pissed off about this. I'd be furious if my wife cut my balls off in front of my son like your wife did to you.

"bibros","t5_2vxlr","&gt; gay sex is nothing more than mutual masturbation with the assistance of an ass and where the other person is an object is obviously homophobic

Yes, taken out of context it is.  But I don't think he means ""gay sex"" generally.  Based on this specific post, it's seems to me he's talking about how gay sex feels for him.  I don't think it's homophobic to describe my feelings about my experiences with gay sex this way. 

&gt;and the guy literally responded to me saying that men who view gay sex as more than mutual masturbation with the assistance of an ass are in the minority. 

This is exactly what I say later on that you refute!  He's being the toxic bisexual claiming that truly homosexual people (and straight people) don't exist or are at least rare.   He believes that everyone experiences sex the way he does.  

&gt;this guy has literally hundreds of comments on askgaybros making disgusting anti gay claims about how gay men aren't actually gay and they actually like women

I'm not going to read all of them looking for things that sound homophobic.  He's not being a ""lunatic homophobe"" he just is a bisexual man with low empathy skills and so he thinks that everyone experiences sex like him.  It is toxic and despicable no matter who does this and it should be condemned.  I just think you're misusing the word homophobic.  Homophobic implies fear and hate and while that may be what he is, the examples you've provided so far, and what I've read on my own don't seem homophobic.  There is no reason to fear this person, he isn't going to hurt you, he's not going to try and take away your rights.  He believes something really stupid.  

&gt;
claiming that gay men don't exist and that gay men do like women but just need to try it is obvious lunatic homophobic garbage.

It's garbage but it's not homophobic.  I've had gay people say the SAME things to me.  It's garbage, it's discriminatory, but does it make sense to call them homophobic?  No.  He's openly bisexual.  He admits to having sex with men and enjoying it.  

&gt;
how does that guys creepy, loon homophobic comments shed light on that? that issue has nothing to do with anything being discussed here

Because his comments show that bisexuals can and do discriminate against homosexuals in the same way that homosexuals sometimes do to us (and that often gets discussed in the bi community).  It just underlines the importance of educating people and should be a moment to self-reflect and make sure that we ourselves know not to push on anyone the idea that ""most people are actually bisexual.""  

I'm going to reserve ""homophobe"" for people that I need to be wary of.  You're not really disagreeing with much else.  I don't know why you think calling him a homophobe is necessary for you to get the point across that he's being a dick.  My guess is you've grown up in a place where you could be open about your sexuality all your life and so your experience of homophobia is so limited that you don't know what it's really like.",1556669030

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O presidente [Jair Bolsonaro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/apos-reuniao-sobre-venezuela-bolsonaro-encoraja-apoio-a-guaido.shtml)atendeu a pedido de asilo político de [25 militares venezuelanos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/brasil-ve-adesao-militar-maior-e-risco-de-guerra-civil-em-caracas.shtml) na embaixada do Brasil na Venezuela. A informação foi confirmada à **Folha** pelo porta-voz da Presidência da República, Otávio Rêgo Barros.

 A reportagem da **Folha **em Caracas** **apurou, porém, que apesar de ter sido dada a autorização para a concessão do asilo, o processo ainda depende de uma série de procedimentos e que no momento não há militares venezuelanos na embaixada brasileira na capital. 

 Segundo o porta-voz, os militares que pediram refúgio às autoridades brasileiras são de baixa patente, de soldados a tenentes.

 Ele disse ainda que a sede da missão diplomática brasileira em Caracas está num prédio comercial, o que traz dificuldades para a permanência de 25 pessoas permanentemente no local. 

 ""Há a possibilidade de uma transferência para outro ambiente que esteja sob a égide da bandeira brasileira naquele país"", disse o porta-voz.

 O pedido de asilo ocorre em meio a um[ confronto entre apoiadores do ditador Nicolás Maduro e seus opositores](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/guaido-antecipa-atos-contra-maduro-vai-ate-base-militar-e-caracas-amanhece-sob-tensao.shtml) nas ruas de Caracas [(ACOMPANHE AO ](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/30/5694-aovivo.shtml)[VIVO)](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/30/5694-aovivo.shtml). 

 Na madrugada desta terça (30), os líderes da oposição Juan Guaidó e Leopoldo López deram início a uma ação para tentar derrubar o regime de Maduro.

 López, que estava em prisão domiciliar, foi para a rua ao lado de Guaidó. Ambos se dirigiram para a base aérea de La Carlota, em Caracas, onde anunciaram o apoio de militares dissidentes e convocaram a população a se juntar a eles.

 Maduro, no entanto, disse que as Forças Armadas do país seguem leais a ele e convocou uma manifestação popular em apoio a seu governo.

 O presidente Jair Bolsonaro fez diversas manifestações de apoio à derrubada do governo venezuelano.

 Por meio de uma nota, o presidente encorajou países a apoiarem o movimento para retirar Maduro do cargo. O Palácio do Planalto divulgou uma nota encorajando apoio de dirigentes dos países a Guaidó, líder da Assembleia Nacional autoproclamado presidente interino da Venezuela. 

 ""Exortamos todos os países, identificados com os ideais de liberdade, para que se coloquem ao lado do presidente encarregado Juan Guaidó na busca de uma solução que ponha fim na ditadura de Maduro, bem como restabeleça a normalidade institucional na Venezuela"", afirmou o presidente por meio de nota divulgada pelo porta-voz do governo. 

 O texto, assinado por Rêgo Barros, repete que o Brasil ""acompanha com grande atenção a situação na Venezuela e reafirma o irrestrito apoio ao seu povo que luta bravamente por democracia"".

 A nota foi divulgada após encontro realizado no Palácio do Planalto na manhã desta terça-feira (30) para discutir a situação da Venezuela. 

 O presidente convocou uma reunião de emergência no fim da manhã desta terça após o movimento da oposição do país vizinho.

 Além de Bolsonaro, participaram do encontro o vice-presidente, general Hamilton Mourão, e os ministros Augusto Heleno (GSI), Ernesto Araújo (Relações Exteriores) e Fernando Azevedo (Defesa).

 Após a reunião, Heleno demonstrou incerteza com o futuro da Venezuela ao afirmar que o apoio de militares a Guaidó[ não alcança ""os altos escalões"" das Forças Armadas ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/04/heleno-diz-que-apoio-militar-a-guaido-nao-alcanca-os-altos-escaloes.shtml)do país e que ""não há uma expectativa de solução no curto prazo"" para a crise venezuelana. 

 ""A gente tem a sensação de que o lado do Guaidó é fraco militarmente"", afirmou o ministro. 

 ""No início da manhã, não se percebeu movimentação militar, mas foi anunciado pelo Guaidó um maciço apoio das forças armadas. Logo depois isso foi colocado na dimensão correta: havia um certo apoio das forças armadas, mas isso não chegava a atingir os altos escalões, ficava ali no escalão mais baixo"", avaliou. 

 ""O que tem parecido é que esse apoio [dos militares a Guaidó] talvez tenha algum valor quantitativo, mas qualitativo ele ainda não foi expressado. Não teve nenhum chefe militar que a gente tenha assistido ou ouvido dando um apoio explícito ao presidente Guaidó"", disse o ministro do GSI.",1556669030

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Had a Gigabyte mobo that came with a capacitor missing back when I was 14(19 years ago) and Newegg said I had to contact Gigabyte because product was damaged (Old policy). Gigabyte accused me if damaging mobo after I told them I had only opened the box. Like a fool, I bought a Gigabyte motherboard a three years after that when I was doing an Intel build for a client because they wanted Gigabyte. I got bitched out because the mobo was DOA and calling Newegg, lead to calling Gigabyte, which got me blamed again... Apparently an antistatic wrist strap attached to metal case and not standing on carpet, isn't good enough. Day forward to 2015, I buy a Gigabyte Radeon r290 OC Windforce because the reviews are decent, price was right and I had figured if Gigabyte is still in the game, they must be putting out something worth while. It overheats consistently and system will lock. Gigabyte says to send the card in, they test it and say nothing is wrong and suggest it's my setup, which most likely wasn't the issue. I know what I'm doing in builds way more often than not and know how to setup cooling. After searching for weeks, I find in a message board a discussion that amounts to, the Hawaii GPUs voltage throttle when they heat up so drastically that the card has issues. Run MSI Afterburner and force constant voltage, make fans more aggressive. Gigabyte was wrong, again.

There's the story of my interactions with Giganope. I hear they make good stuff but, I have to to see it in person experience.

Secondly, I don't believe in judging the business or policy decisions made by a company by the way they treat their employees (unless said decisions directly affect how said employees are treated).

"PS5","t5_2s887","You are missing the point here by a mile. Games are made on PCs - true. Games are made on PC with a target system in mind. So the engine and textures and all are optimized for that target system. Since consoles have the same architechiture that does not change for years, it is easier to keep making games for them at a reasonable rate. PC gaming is a another scenario altogether. Since the install base is so widely varied in terms of hardware, the games released for PC are more prone to bugs and hardware issues. This is the basic part for game development for PC vs console. 

Coming to  games being developed on PC and ""downscaled"" for console is a blatant and unadulterated lie mostly spread by misinformed and ignorant journalists who have no idea how games are made. Console games are not downscaled at all. They are made from scratch with the constraint of being required to run on optimized console hardware. If downscaling was all that devs had to do, then every effing game on console would have a PC version for sure. Devs have to ""port"" the console code for PC hardware for it to work at all. Then they have to test for bugs and QA. So a lot of work to get that console code to work on PC. Not just ""upscale"". 

Lastly, game studios are largely divided as multi-platform and single platform ones. Naughty Dog is a Sony owned studio that makes games for the PS line up only. Sony didn't pay for exclusivity. They own the studio and hence make games for the PS. FromSoftware,Ubisoft, GearBox are example of multi-platform studios. They develop games for PC and console alike but the dev teams are different even if the core game is the same. I agree sometimes MS or Sony will pay for title exclusivity for a limited time for multi-platform games but this is a timed thing. If either have a game for its own console system it usually is made by one of their owned studios. 

Sometimes it helps to learn to understand how things work before repeating points made by low quality yet highly accessible web articles. Most of the writers hardly know anything tech related and hence spew garbage. If you really want to know something books are a good place to start followed by reading articles by reputable authors published on reputable sites.",1556669032

Today they get paid from United Healthcare. From Anthem. From Medicare. From Cigna. Single Payer just changes that to only Medicare.

Every doctor I know loves this - they have to hire a staff of sometimes dozens of people to do filing and contesting claims with insurance carriers, in addition to chasing accounts payable from patients. A single payer simplifies all of that. 

And just like Canada, England and Norway, doctors are not forced to take it. They can work as cash only doctors... few do, mind you. The same reason few doctors in America do that currently. Cash-only doctors typically service the ultra-wealthy, providing concierge medicine.

This system is neither hard nor oppression. It is replicated in every industrialized country on the face of the earth.",1556669033

"podemos","t5_31h78","Si no está Hillary aún en la cárcel obviamente todo lo demás está postpuesto. Lo primero es ver a Hillary en la cárcel, luego el cabal intentando montar un cristo y el despliegue militar para evitarlo/contraatacarlos. Pero quizá ya no estemos en esa linea de tiempo pues parece ser que hemos saltado a una de las mejores y la transición será muy suave. Aunque ciertamente parezca lo contrario si ves el telediario, que si una iglesia arde, que sin una mezquita al mismo tiempo, que si ahora una sinagoga, que si montones de bombas en reuniones cristianas en Sri Lanka, que si reconstrucción de Notre Dame ""de acuerdo con la moderna Francia (???)""... supongo que la sensación es de que estamos metidos en un caos sinsentido. Se trata de los intentos desesperados de sembrar caos por parte de los que ya han perdido y antes controlaban el planeta. En los foros de conspiraciones tenemos gente pagada por el cabal todos los días. Ahora mismo están poniendo threads de si Trump ha obstaculizado la justicia, lo cual significa lo siguiente: al ser Trump presidente los de Hillary and company le lanzaron una investigación de si ganó porque los rusos le ayudaron. Al ser una investigación, Trump no puede ponerse a investigarlos a ellos hasta que la investigación acabe (sino se considera obstrucción a la justicia, en este caso a la investigación). Por lo que han estado dos años parados sin poder hacer nada pues todo sería tomado como obstrucción. Ahora ya está llegando al final eso, pero aún así los astutos shills están tratando de buscar cosas y crear una opinion entre la gente. A ver si ya en unas cuantas semanas ya se solucionan todos los flecos y veremos entonces si son necesarios los militares como sí lo iba a ser hace dos años, antes de que los demócratas obstruyeran todo lo que venía. Si crees que nunca vas a ver a Hillary en prision (o muerta antes pues antes de ir a prision ""mueren"" (acaso alguien abre el ataud, lo han abierto en el caso de Bush padre? mostrando al difunto a la gente, como sí se hace en la muerte de otros como Chaves, etc?) te vas a llevar una sorpresa porque no falta ya mucho para que todo eso empiece. Todo el cambio económico ya se está produciendo (o sea, bancos aceptando transacciones en otro sistema nuevo) aunque esto está siendo ""camuflado"" con el nombre de ""acuerdos de China de un proyecto ""Road Belt"" o algo así le llaman, al que se han añadido Italia e infinidad más de paises. Este ""acuerdo""  no es más que el cambio de un sistema económico muy fácilmente controlable por el cabal, a un sistema imposible de controlar (tiene encriptaciones al estilo bitcoin). 

Sobre si son listos los demócratas o son más listos los republicanos, mira en cada pais qué grupo cree a la mass media y qué grupo conoce que toda la mass media está controlada y por tanto se usa para alimentar con mentiras a la gente para producir los efectos que esas mentiras buscan. En cada pais los grupos son distintos, así por ejemplo son los ""conservadores"" los que más control mental muestran (aunque el tema de votantes del PSOE está a la par en mi opinion), y en otros paises como en USA esos ""conservadores"" son los que desconfían de la mass media, que está controlada por judíos. O sea que el ser de un partido no indica que seas más listo, sio que es el ser capaz de ver el control que ejercen sobre ti y otras cosas como el que tu cerebro recuerde algo aunque estés bombardeado día y noche para que lo olvides, lo que (al menos para mi) indica inteligencia o falta de ella. El futuro no está escrito pero sí se conoce cómo va a acabar todo lo que estamos viviendo: con una sociedad igual para todos, donde cada persona tiene todos los derechos como cualquier otra, sin sistema de castas. El cómo se llegue a eso puede ser a través de muchas lineas de tiempo, unas algo peores (más sufrimiento) y otras mejores, con transicciones que la gente ni se entera. No está escrito el camino que recorramos, pero sí está escrito el final, pues se ve que todos los caminos llevan a ese final. Ahora mismo lo de que sea necesaria la intervención militar en USA, no es una probabilidad alta en esta linea de tiempo en la que estamos (una de las mejores posibles, pues el cabal ha puesto montones de retrasos y eso ha ido derivando en una linea de tiempo sin tantas muertes como otras más rápidas).",1556669033
"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Right, and that argument is wrong. ""An unmoved immaterial being"" is not necessary; we can say with full confidence that the universe could have been generated without ""an unmoved immaterial being"". I provided sources for literally seven conjectures about the origin of the universe that rely neither on an infinite series nor on ""an unmoved immaterial being"". Importantly, all those conjectures are consistent with known laws of physics, while God is not (since, by definition, he supersedes such laws).

I agree with Krauss that quantum fluctuation is probably the cleanest conjecture, since quantum fluctuations have been observed to be real and a consequence thereof is that *it is literally impossible for nothing to exist*. Keep that in mind: under our current understanding of the laws of physics, *it is impossible for nothing to exist*.

So, yes, the known laws of physics definitively refute the cosmological argument. It is entirely possible for the universe to emerge without resorting to an infinite series or to God.",1556669033

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A Câmara de São Paulo aprovou nesta terça-feira (30) [projeto de lei](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/04/projeto-de-lei-que-fixa-em-10-iptu-de-sp-isenta-imoveis-ligados-a-igrejas.shtml) que isenta do pagamento de IPTU na capital imóveis ligados a templos e igrejas. 

 Na terceira tentativa em aprovar o projeto de lei, a bancada evangélica, liderada pelo presidente da Câmara, o vereador [Eduardo ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/04/camara-de-sp-quer-cpi-para-apurar-noticias-contra-o-legislativo-municipal.shtml)[Tuma](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/04/camara-de-sp-quer-cpi-para-apurar-noticias-contra-o-legislativo-municipal.shtml) (PSDB), saiu vitoriosa com 30 votos a favor, cinco contra e oito abstenções. 

 A primeira votação ocorreu na véspera do feriado de Páscoa, na última quarta-feira (17), e não passou por falta de quórum. 

 O projeto de lei original previa isenção apenas ao imóvel em que ocorre a prática religiosa. A bancada evangélica conseguiu a inclusão de um parágrafo que isenta do pagamento de imposto os imóveis localizados no mesmo terreno de igrejas e templos, com exceção de endereços alugados ou explorados comercialmente.

 Assim, a isenção prevista em lei aos imóveis usados para prática religiosa é estendida a escritórios, e outros tipos de endereços usados pelas igrejas desde que não seja praticada atividade empresarial. 

 O parágrafo que favorece a bancada religiosa do Legislativo paulistano foi incluído no projeto de lei prometido pela gestão do prefeito Bruno Covas (PSDB) após a secretaria da Fazenda reconhecer erro na cobrança do imposto referente a anos anteriores. 

 Confrontada por questionamentos sobre aumentos de mais de 50% cobrados em boletos emitidos neste ano, a Secretaria de Finanças [admitiu que 90 mil imóveis usufruíram de desconto](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/prefeitura-assume-falha-e-iptu-pode-superar-50-de-reajuste.shtml) no imposto de forma indevida. 

 Diante do erro, o prefeito [decidiu não cobrar o valor ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/por-que-meu-iptu-teve-aumento-tire-suas-duvidas-sobre-a-cobranca.shtml)[retroativo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/02/por-que-meu-iptu-teve-aumento-tire-suas-duvidas-sobre-a-cobranca.shtml) referente aos anos em que o desconto foi aplicado.

 Anunciado pela gestão Covas em fevereiro, o projeto de lei foi encaminhado pela terceira vez para votação em plenário nesta terça-feira (30).",1556669035

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I have a close friend who struggled with alcoholism. Nicest guy you’ve ever met. When he’s drunk, he turns into a cocky abomination that you have to walk on eggshells around. He will continually not only talk about himself, but also seem unable to conceptualize anyone else as important. 

It took a long time, but I (and a group of our other friends) figured out how to affect his drunken behavior. We recorded how he acted when he was drunk. The self absorbed behavior of their drunken self will usually elicit guilt in their sober minds. They need to see for themselves what they’re like while intoxicated. Social pressure will do the job for you as long as you aren’t directly confrontational. When given no enemies for defense mechanisms to target, the truth will eventually sink into the sober mind. Drunken actions follow sober thoughts, so they should slowly change.

Keep in mind this is just what worked for my situation; I’m not claiming it’s 100% foolproof.

Anyway, Best of luck.

What if I live in a middle class neighborhood- worked hard to move my family to a safer area - which costs more. Is it then right to move in a group of people who unfortunately turn to crime to either feed habits, or so they can eat. But then you also move in people with many mental health issues.

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","As I understand it, those vehemently opposed to feminism (and frankly a lot of people outside of that group) feel it was random and forced and took away from the movie. On the other side, some people very much for feminism feel that it’s Marvel taking a minute to congratulate themselves for female representation when they really haven’t done much to earn that congratulations 

I’m somewhere in the middle, I think it’s a fantastic moment that doesn’t make sense when thought about but works on the emotional “fuck yeah” level it’s going for. However, the point stands that with *one* exception, it’s a bunch of side characters getting together for 30 seconds before the movie goes back to letting the guys handle things. It’s a first step, and I’m glad to see it taken, but there’s the ever-present concern that maybe Marvel thinks that that’s enough when it really isn’t",1556669038

There were lots of decent bands around Oly at the time, as well as bands coming through. I never really made a point to see Nirvana in particular — the first time was when they played the soccer field at Evergreen. I was doing a lot of sound engineering and making my own weird, not-at-all ""grunge"" (whatever), music at the time.

Kurt in particular was friends with some of my friends (a couple of whom became kind of well-known), but I didn't really know him. By the time I got to Oly I'd already spent years hanging out with musicians in the small city I escaped from and so the music scene didn't seem all that special. It's only in retrospect that I'm like, ""Huh. What we were doing was kind of a big deal after all."" But by the time it became a big deal I'd gone on to other stuff.

A good friend of mine was in Kurt's class in Aberdeen. He remembers him as even more messed up than everyone else there, and if you've ever been to Aberdeen you can imagine how bad that must be.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A jornalista Sandra Balbi tinha costume de ler obituários em jornais e ensinou o hábito para a filha, Julia Balbi. A intenção era tomar conhecimento da morte de algum conhecido para ter tempo de prestar as últimas homenagens.

 Por isso, quando foi procurada pela **Folha**, nesta terça-feira (30), algumas horas após a cerimônia de cremação da mãe, Julia fez questão de falar sobre ela, apesar do momento delicado. ""É uma chance de homenageá-la mais uma vez"". 

 Sandra cresceu em Ponta Grossa (PR), mas foi na capital paulista onde viveu maior parte de sua vida e construiu sua carreira como jornalista de economia e negócios.   
   
 No ano 2000, ajudou a implantar na **Folha** a seção Folhainvest, dedicada à cobertura do mercado financeiro, onde trabalhou até 2005.   
   
 Sandra também exerceu o jornalismo de economia nas revistas Isto É, Exame e na sucursal paulistana do extinto Jornal do Brasil.   
   
 Após passar pelos veículos da grande imprensa, Sandra se tornou editora da revista eletrônica Elas e Lucros. 

 Entre os colegas de trabalho, Sandra deixou a memória de uma pessoa generosa e dedicada à profissão, escolhida para dar vazão ao olhar curioso que sempre dedicou ao mundo ao seu redor.

 “Passou pelo mundo em uma trajetória de solidariedade ao outro”, disse a amiga de longa data e também jornalista Marili Ribeiro.   
   
 O jornalista Fabio Alves, que dividiu bancada com Sandra na sucursal do Jornal do Brasil e no Folhainvest, elogiou a elegância com que desenvolvia seus textos para o jornal. “Foi uma grande repórter e uma editora com senso aguçado para notícia”, disse.   
   
 Nos últimos anos, a dedicação de Sandra era quase exclusiva à família e à neta, Valentina, 2, que povoava suas redes sociais com registros encantadores.  
   
 A filha embalou os últimos instantes de vida da mãe com vídeos recentes de Valentina, feitos com a câmera do celular, em que a menina canta a música ""Alecrim Dourado"", ""a música da vovó Sandra"", diz Julia.   
   
 Sandra foi internada na manhã da última segunda-feira (29) em estágio terminal, após lutar por cerca de 12 anos contra um mieloma (tumor nas células plasmáticas).

 Ela faleceu algumas horas depois, aos 67 anos, cercada pela família.   
   
 Ela deixou os filhos Julia e Gabriel, o marido, Eduardo, e a neta, Valentina.

for an extremely rough example, you might currently work an 8 hour day in which the first 4 hours(optimistically) are spent working for your own money and the second 4 are spent producing value for capital. if some technology is introduced that can double your output you would create your value in 2 hours and spend the remaining 6 producing for capital.

as for capital reducing jobs entirely- capital becoming labour: under capitalism automation happens when it becomes cheaper to automate than to pay a worker but as automation is used to depress wages workers, who still need to sell their labour-power to subsist, will accept lower and lower wages so full automation is unlikely to happen.",1556669041

- Accusing Muslim citizens of being more loyal to the ‘Ummah’ (transnational Muslim community) or to their countries of origin, or to the alleged priorities of Muslims worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations

- Denying Muslim populations the right to self- determination e.g., by claiming that the existence of an independent Palestine or Kashmir is a terrorist endeavour

- Applying double standards by requiring of Muslims behaviours that are not expected or demanded of any other groups in society, eg loyalty tests

- **Using the symbols and images associated with classic Islamophobia e.g. Muhammed being a paedophile, claims of Muslims spreading Islam by the sword or subjugating minority groups under their rule**",1556669041
"diyaudio","t5_2tizz","I actually have this particular design! It’s designed by PWK himself based on my specific requirements for a driver I have in my setup which is a sundown e10

The requirements that brought about this particular design were the following:

In cabin response of 25-65hz, my midbass (SI TM65 Mk1 @2ohms) will pick up from there.

Ability to be able to blend with said midbass so after time alignment and extra delays if need be will give the illusion of the subwoofer playing upfront

Highly articulate bass

Ability to pressurize the cabin when needed (ie playing electronic music, rap and other genres)

Ability to control cone excursion for the given power that will be thrown at it:  750w  the sub is a 500w driver

We feel good when we feel happy, so it must be true. Therefore, your purpose in life, the ""point"" of all of this, is to be happy. Make others happy and make yourself happy, and you've made the world a better place. The end. You are good enough as long as you are being kind to others. That's literally it. But now you need to be kind to yourself as well. It can take a lot of energy, but you should find something that makes you happy, like really happy. For me it's music and computer programming and languages. For you it could be anything. And dude take care of yourself, too.

Why? How hard would it be to make it so we never figure out waterboarding. Waterboarding wasn't always a known torture method. I'm sure there are torture methods that we don't know yet and we'd be better off as a species if we never figure it out. Not knowing those methods doesn't infringe on our free will. 

The fact that we don't know all torture methods means there's a cap to how much suffering we can inflict. God could make it so we never get past making people really uncomfortable. The person doing the torturing has already proven they are fine torturing people so you know they are a sinful piece of shit without the disfiguring of another human being. You have your answer of whether they are worthy of heaven or not. 

Any type of harm done past the point of knowing that a person is willing to torture people is unnecessary suffering that God (at the very least) allows. Especially when God, being omniscient, already knows full well how brutally someone would torture a person if they knew every torture method.

You can't claim God is omni-benevolent when he allows people to get brutally tortured when you see how unnecessary that suffering is.",1556669042

Maduro is no angel, but neither is the opposition. I don't support Maduro, but I support the Venezuelans right to sovereignty in their own ordeals. We can help those who need it, but intervening on one side of a heavily split issue in a country that we don't belong to is a recipe for further disaster. You realize how many dictatorships the US supports? We aren't the good guys. When you do find a good guy to intervene let me know, I'll be waiting.

Also Venezuela IS accepting aid from the UN and other nations. Just not the US since we have a history of not just giving humanitarian aid (Google Elliot Abrams). We burned those bridges and you can't be mad when someone sees it and says ""thanks but no thanks""

I understand we are all human, and we should all be treated like human beings, so I understand where you're coming from.

"AskEurope","t5_2uayg","I've been going to the same GP since I was born, it's the one that was assigned to me. However, I'm able to change the doctor if I want.

I think a lot of people get a new GP when they turn 16, since before then you have a pediatrician, unless your doctor specializes in both pediatrics and adult health.

The role of the GP is mostly to send you to specialists or provide you with sick leave for work/school.

There are a few specialists which you can go to without a referral (dermatovenerologist, gynecologist, and maybe something else), or you can pay for other specialists if you want to go without visiting a GP. Usually it's affordable, so it's a good choice if you're in a hurry.",1556669042

"castaneda","t5_2sblm","Disappearing (permanently) into a dreamed reality.

From The Art of Dreaming:

""She told me that her art was to be capable of projecting her intent, and that everything I saw around me (in her dream) was her intent. She said in a whisper that the church and the town were the results of her intent; they did not exist, yet they did. She added, looking into my eyes, that this is one of the mysteries of intending in the second attention the twin positions of dreaming. It can be done, but it cannot be explained or comprehended.

She told me then that she came from a line of sorcerers who knew how to move about in the second attention by projecting their intent. Her story was that the sorcerers of her line practiced the art of projecting their thoughts in dreaming in order to accomplish the truthful reproduction of any object or structure or landmark or scenery of their choice.

She said that the shamans of her line used to start by gazing at a simple object and memorizing every detail of it. They would then close their eyes and visualize the object and correct their visualization against the true object until they could see it, in its completeness, with their eyes shut.

The next thing in their developing scheme was to dream the object and create in the dream, from the point of view of their own perception, a total materialization of the object. This act, the women said, was called the first step to total perception.
From a simple object, those sorcerers went on to take more and more complex items. Their final aim was for all of them together to visualize a total realm, then dream that realm and thus re-create a totally veritable world where they could exist. She told me that whole populations had disappeared dreaming like that.""

When I read that I thought of anthropologists studying South &amp; North American civilizations/villages that seemingly ""disappeared overnight,"" with no evidence of why or how. No doubt most have a mundane reason: drought, invaders etc...but a few...

Also, there's the perennial development of virtual reality, multi-player online video games, and digital mind-uploading to escape into new realities that are collectively engineered as an ""easy"" way to deflect the trauma of our oppressively curtailed perception.

I firmly believe that placing adverse focus on these technological escape mechanisms does a disservice to the spirit of man, and the energy to fight and reclaim our true ""natural state"" (see U.G. Krishnamurti post).",1556669044

What are the default settings of ""those TV's?"" There is no standard for the television hardware manufacturers, so using a reference monitor in the studio is required and editing/grading to a standard is required. The same is true in audio production.

The issues some people had with the episode were either due to compression caused by the CDN's distributing the content being overloaded and having to compensate with more compression, or people who have their TV's set up improperly (or some combination of both.)

Whether you are creating audio or video content, it's not the creator's job to set up your listening/viewing equipment properly. If a musical artist releases a song with experimental deep bass tones under 60Hz, and I have my equalizer set to not play sounds under 60Hz, is it the artist's fault? Should the artist restrict his creativity to account for bad speaker setup or my EQ preferences? It's all fine and dandy testing something on a decent car stereo system, but what about a car stereo that has the EQ set up in a funky way due to the user? How do you account for that? Adjusting it to match the improperly set up equipment will ruin it on other equipment.

The same applies to this episode. It was a battle fought in a blizzard in the middle of the night. If it were bright, it wouldn't be realistic or convey the mood that was intended. If people have set their TV to a high contrast mode that crushes highlights and lowlight details, that's not the creators fault. Saying it is, shows a rudimentary understanding of how the technology behind it all works.

No one said anything about being poor. You can use a shitty TV and as long as it is set up properly, you can see everything just fine. I've downloaded a copy of the episode, all details are within spec. per my testing. I have a shitty LED TV in my garage, and I can see everything just fine on the shitty TV, as well as my OLED TV, because both are calibrated correctly.

If you've gone back and viewed it on your TV again now that compression/distribution aren't as much of an issue, and you still can't see the details in the dark scenes, you'll be much more productive if you spent your time learning how to do a basic calibration on your TV, then complaining about how professionals who are at the top of their game (or else they wouldn't be working on the worlds most popular and anticipated show,) are bad at their job.",1556669044

I don’t think any trans person has ever questioned biology.. we are very aware, of what we are biologically - that’s why I was making the point is really is mostly societal so using pronouns that someone is asking is not asking you to question or defy biology. I’m sure most would agree that it is ignorant to not call someone female because you don’t want to/disagree. You aren’t being a total ass about it, only very mildly and aren’t meaning to, I can tell. 
And I’m not really offended, offended isn’t the right word, I like talking to people about these things because it’s interesting to me and even as a trans person I understand some people’s opposing views. But at the end even if it’s a disagreement I think anyone can use a “correct pronoun” without biology coming into it. Sure, you can think we / they are weirdos because you don’t understand it and that’s fine, I do that with people all the time and other people’s lives but then I just don’t associate myself with them, etc, or put myself in any positions. 
And fighting hate with hate I’ve never agreed with, sure it might be ignorant but calling you or anyone an ignorant fuck even if you were flat out insulting isn’t going to solve anything.

I’m not here to argue about the extent to which those sort of views are bad/useful/harmful/natural/inescapable/etc, but they certainly do invoke some level of objectification of sexual partners as tokens of positive or negative status based on their perceived “marketplace value.”  For people who link their own self worth and status heavily to those kind of sexual metrics, exploring a partners’ sexual history can be a real minefield of insecurities.

Valve's current pricing is cheaper than the Vive Pro kit. 

what a lot of people miss is that the necessary hardware has to be present for people to even be able to push VR headsets. a GTX970 is the bare minumum for most platforms. most people have worse cards than that. 

the people that have higher end GPUs and use them for gaming are already a fairly niche market. so even if this headset did go for $250 or so, people would then complain about having to buy a more powerful GPU to push it. 

the VR market has come a long way from just a few years ago. it's solidified as something more than a just a fad, and is a bonafide fledgling market. this headset will help push that along. 

Valve announced a long time ago that they were already working on 3 full AAA VR titles. those titles coupled with a sale or something towards the later half of this year, could really be a big push. 

Valve knows it's expensive, that's part of why the kits are available piecemeal.",1556669046

These Baptists were absolutely baffled when displaying Bible verses to people didn't immediately result in repentance and conversion. Many church leaders insisted that even the hardest-core skeptics would be persuaded of Scriptural validity by 2 Timothy 3:16:

Marriage is something totally different, and you’re not married to her. Don’t do it. It’s your money that you work for.

From the start, YandereDev has been structuring the game so that things don't happen easily; you have to wait for the right opportunities to find your rival alone by stalking her and killing her then, or you have to create opportunities. If one setting is overkill, that's probably because you're either not supposed to kill a rival there or because you have to create an opportunity so that you can, by sending students to distract other people or by killing them earlier. It's a strategic game and you're going to find lots of problems and you'll have to come up with solutions to them. I think in the video with the bullies he gives a good example of this.",1556669047

"5ToubunNoHanayome","t5_4deoo","Based solely on anime characterizations for kaguya:

1: ichika's got better things to do; kaguya doesn't appreciate her torments and's easy to bait. Comic but kaguya ends up looking bad (or at least, there's a clear winner and loser each convo).

2: decent; mutual if shallow appreciation, for very distinct reasons for each other. Kaguya has to carry the humor in this one with nino taking herself so seriously.

3: they're kind of the same character, and not in very productive ways.

4: Works out fine -  for drama think 4's relationship to 3 (with kaguya taking the place of 3) in the kyoto arc of QQ or fuu in general, and for comedy kaguya bossing around 4 is a fun mental image. 4's actually pretty distinct from secretary fujiwara - the secretary is broadly drawn and generally light, whereas 4 is surprisingly thoughtful and is asked to flex into different roles - but she makes a good sidekick for kaguya and to show what kaguya's actually good at (and 4's tolerant enough it makes sense why she'd put up with kaguya's antics). Mentally replace fuu in 36/37 with kaguya and I think you'll see what I like about it.

5: Best buds. Like 3 with kaguya they've got a lot of similarities, but 5's a lot better off interacting with what kaguya's good at.",1556669049

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","**Jus soli**

Jus soli (English:  ; Latin pronunciation: [juːs ˈsɔ.liː]), meaning ""right of the soil"", commonly referred to as birthright citizenship in the United States, is the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship.Jus soli was part of the English common law, in contrast to jus sanguinis, which derives from the Roman law that influenced the civil-law systems of continental Europe. Jus soli is the predominant rule in the Americas, but it is rare elsewhere. Since the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was enacted in 2004, no European country grants citizenship based on unconditional or near-unconditional jus soli.Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of jus sanguinis (right of blood), in which citizenship is inherited through parents rather than birthplace, or a restricted version of jus soli in which citizenship by birthplace is automatic only for the children of certain immigrants.

Jus soli in many cases helps prevent statelessness.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Favorite to least:

1. Gen 7. I love how much character the Alola region has; it’s definitely the most unique and interesting setting in my eyes. I loved the trial system; I wouldn’t want it to replace gyms in every game, but it was a fun change of pace that fit the region well. It’s got a great set of starters - Rowlet is my favorite Pokémon of all time, but I don’t dislike any of them - and introduces a lot of other new Pokémon that I really like, and the regional Dex feels neither too big nor too small and a good blend of old and new. There are enough good Pokémon of various types that there are at least 5 different types I think it would be fun to play a monotype with in Alola, which is not something I can say for any other region. The tutorials and cutscenes are annoying, but balanced out by the quality of life improvements from getting rid of HMs and late-gen EXP mechanics.

2. Gen 3. Not sure exactly what it is about it, Hoenn just does it for me. One of my favorite sets of starters, and one of the generations with the most new Pokémon I like in general. Does get points deducted for the interactions with the evil team being entirely too short and easy; raiding the villains’ HQ should feel like a marathon, not be over in less than ten battles. (Emerald partially fixed this, though.)

3. Gen 1. Horribly broken, but the brokenness has a charm of its own when you’re in the mood for it, and the nostalgia rush is always fun.

4. Gen 6. Easy but fun. I like the new EXP mechanics making things less grindy, and I love the addition of the fairy type, but the regional Dex feels kinda bloated and overall the storyline and region fail to be memorable for me.

5. Gen 4. Painfully slow, and the limited availability of Pokémon in the originals is a pain. Platinum was a significant improvement, but not enough to save my general impression of this generation from being that it dragged. Points for being more challenging than most, though; Cynthia was genuinely hard.

6. Gen 2. The experience curve is even more broken than Gen 1, so it feels like I’m constantly having to grind and constantly underleveled despite it, half the interesting new Pokémon and good TMs are inaccessible until after you’ve beaten the Elite 4, and Kanto just feels sad and empty. I actually really like the Johto region itself, I just wish they’d make a game that was fully set in Johto, because the way they tried to stretch it out over two regions did not work.

Not Ranked: Gen 5, I haven’t played it yet.",1556669051

People claim it’s a money issue since T_D users buy so much gold, but I don’t buy that. It’s because cracking down on it would make the website look like it has a political slant.
Other shitty subreddits that are alt right like CA aren’t directly tied to a political campaign, so they can be dealt with without appearing like they’re biased like they would if they quarantined or banned T_D, which is what so many people here want. This is unrealistic because it would make reddit look like it has a liberal angle, which they don’t want and its understandable in my opinion.
The solution to this, of course, is to crack down super hard on it rather than simply quarantining/banning it  it but reddit hasn’t figured that out yet. I think they will soon enough though.",1556669053

This is just the beginning - there are alot of unknowns which could fall either way (positive or negative) but the reality is there is more risk to uncover something which would hurt the industry not help it.  That being said - price action is a different conversation.  Currently I struggle to understand why the premium exists on BTC on BFX when USDT is almost exactly $1.  This seems 'off' which makes me curious to what potential outside and/or inside persons/entities are putting this upward pressure on price.  In any market uncertainty usually causes sell off, hesitation and/or stagnation .... which BTC did just that .... sold off, hesitated but is not stagnating.  To me it feels like there are too many unknowns to instantly be back at where we were before BFX potential legal issues.  Also - people are quick to forget the $1000 BGD.....this was not your usual organic trend reversal signal.  This was, what most believe, done by one actor, which we all know the intent was not to accumulate but to induce FOMO and increase the price drastically.  It is extremely interesting - just something feels off about what is propping up the market at the moment.",1556669054

I think FF is indeed a bit out of date (some people even mentioned it in the survey), I used it a lot more when I was younger (by that I mean about a decade ago), but it seems to have fallen out of use for most, and AO3 has become more prominent. I also keep hearing that better written works are on AO3 rather than FF. Otherwise someone else did mention fanfics getting deleted, I just assumed it's a bad glitch on their part.

&gt;A conceptual framework for the origin of the Moon must explain both the chemical and the mechanical characteristics of the Earth–Moon system to be viable. The classic concept of an oblique giant impact explains the large angular momentum and the lack of a large iron-rich core to the Moon, but in this scenario it is difficult to explain the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon without violating the angular momentum constraint. Here we propose that a giant, solid impactor hit the proto-Earth while it was covered with a magma ocean, under the conventional collision conditions. We perform density-independent smoothed particle hydrodynamic collision simulations with an equation of state appropriate for molten silicates. These calculations demonstrate that, because of the large difference in shock heating between silicate melts and solids (rocks), a substantial fraction of the ejected, Moon-forming material is derived from the magma ocean, even in a highly oblique collision. We show that this model reconciles the compositional similarities and differences between the Moon and Earth while satisfying the angular momentum constraint.",1556669056

    var box = [1, 2, 3];
    var randomRotation = new Array(box.length).fill(null).map(function(_, index) {
      // You aren't doing anything with value or index, but you have access to them here
      return random(-100, 100);
    });
    
    //randomRotation will be an array of 3 integers between -100 and 100

There are several ways you can achieve what you want, but in my opinion, the above is most straight forward. Note, you could have called map on box itself, but in my personal opinion, if you don't actually need to access the variables inside of box, then you can make that explicit by instantiating a new array with the length of box. Calling `#fill` on the instantiated Array returns an array literal (so it would be the same thing as `[null, null, null]`) so that you can call `Array#map` on it.

The reason you can call `return` here, but not in a for loop, is because the above example is using a closure, and you are only returning a value from the closure be used by `Array#map`. In a for loop, you are never leaving the current scope, and so when you `return`, you are quite literally returning out of the current scope and returning a value to the outer scope (if you called this on `window`, you should get an error).",1556669057

1. walk away with the hidden immunity idol 
OR
2. press their luck and try to turn their idol into this supercharged vote steal idol

they must guess and smash the correct vase in all 3 pairs in order to get the supercharged idol
if they smash the wrong vase once, they lose the hidden immunity idol and walk away with nothing

with the rules I set up, the person has:

Poch is working with less than bare minimum. He pulls off magic with his substitutions, switching formations when someone gets injured. Klopp and Guardiola don't have to do that. If we wanna start fighting for the title like we did for a few seasons, we have to actually buy players. It's my personal opinion but I actually think our midfield is pretty solid. Wanyama for Dier, Winks replacing Dembele with no one to back up Winks, etc. We just need one more attacking player provided Eriksen doesn't leave for a great offensive set. I think we have more depth than people realize, but it's unreliable depth, which is why this season has been a struggle. 

We don't need too many players, but the positions in which we need them, added with a squad that breaks a leg if they sneeze, has made this season a nightmare.",1556669059

The market was right and the execution deeply flawed.

Facebook treated their subscribers poorly with privacy setting three-card-monte. The plane was fueled ready for another mass migration similar to Myspace to Facebook. All Google+ had to do was provide a marginally better experience to get the stampede rushing onto a new platform.

Instead Google+ rolled out with all of the worse data collection and privacy issues that fueled demand to leave Facebook. People came over and inspected the plane. Exactly identical to all the negative features of Facebook.

So instead they scattered to half a dozen other locations. Instagram or just stayed put with crappy features of Facebook.

If instead Google+ released a stripped down privacy-focused platform at launch, they could have grabbed that stampede then gradually turned on data collection later after Facebook tumbled.

Whomever lead the Google+ project grasped failure out of near certain success.",1556669059

You mean when Theon spent thirty seconds letting NK know exactly how he was going to attack and giving every chance for NK to counter? Nah, I didn’t miss that.

&gt;Or when a White Walker kicked Jon and he flew like 10 yards?

Yeah, and crossbow bolts can hurl someone backward five feet and pin them against a wall without any recoil on the shooter. It’s a TV show, it looks cool.

None of these constitutes proof that it’s impossible to get the drop on a WW or the NK specifically. They’re strong and fast. So are like half the main characters. Like I said, we’ve seen them killed already.

&gt;Not to mention if you watch that scene again he holds her for a good second or two before she even drops the dagger. He had more than enough time to tear her apart he just inexplicably paused for dramatic effect because the plot demanded it.

WWs still take time to process information. Arya was ready and NK wasn’t. This is such a weird quibble. It’s not like they locked eyes and screamed at each other for a half hour like a DBZ fight.

&gt;My point here is that the NK has a reputation. He nearly wiped out all of civilization in the past. I'm really supposed to believe no one could get the drop on him if it's this easy? That's what seems illogical to me.

At what point during the last 10,000 years or whatever did the NK expose himself enough that anyone could stab him? At what point was he ever so close to victory that he might be distracted enough to let his guard down? They even make a point of his hubris with all his little smirks.

&gt;He was built up since the first episode as a force of nature, something greater than the realms of men that would punish them for their petty squables over the Iron Throne. That has been repeated over and over and over again so many times it's impossible to miss. Instead of being that force of nature punishing a divided humanity he vanishes in one night against the first line of defense passed the Wall.

If he’s supposed to teach them the error of squabbling over thrones, that’s pretty clearly your own prediction rather than anything explicitly said in the show. Sorry that didn’t pan out, but that’s the issue with predictions I guess.

&gt;Really? Nedd Stark loses his head because he chose honor over saving his own neck. Robb Stark and his family are massacred because he did not honor his responsibilities as a Lord. Stannis has his army destroyed because he was too stubborn and lost his humanity in his lust for the throne and failed to see through Melisandre's lies, sacrificing the only thing that mattered to him and losing the faith of his men. Jon Snow fought for the greater good against tradition to help the Wildlings and paid the price of being massacred by his own men.

Who learned anything from this stuff? Seems like you just listed people who got killed because they didn’t learn shit.

&gt;Because I literally just said I also enjoyed the episode, I just found certain parts of it narratively unsatisfying.

Uh, cool?

There's even small amounts of movement that happen as you pull the trigger to factor in. If you pull the trigger again before you can stabilise the recoil, the bullet will travel in the direction relevant to where the barrel is facing - it could be up, it could be to one side - it could even be down if you overcompensate for how much kick the gun has when fired - it's not where the dot is facing in these cases that matters if the barrel is facing at a different angle to your line of sight to the target.",1556669060

In this video  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uv5NeCU3XY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uv5NeCU3XY) look at the parts with the flexible bushings where the arm attaches to the frame under the car.  They need to allow the arm to move up and down with suspension but must resist all front to back motion.  Imagine if the car was on jacks and you were able to push the wheel toward the back of the car and then released it forward over and over.  I'm not telling you to check this because you probably wouldn't be able to apply enough pressure.

This is what I think is happening a little while driving and a lot while braking (due to the way the load is applied).  Now imagine both front wheels moving like that at different patterns depending on what they are hitting in the road; that leads to the severe vibration braking and light vibration while driving.

The lifting off the ground may have put the bushing into a tighter position temporarily until you hit a bump and it went back to its typical location.

I've worked on a few cars experiencing this lately (mostly Honda oddly enough) and replacing with quality parts fixed it long term (I actually followed up).  I truly believe this is what is occurring based on your scenario, the tolerances on that motion are incredibly critical.",1556669060

She got laid off from her office job and was having a hard time finding work.
She applied and got a job as a mail carrier for USPS in the rural area where they live.

This was 80% walking and 20% driving.
Over three months she lost almost 50lbs just drinking water and walking almost 10miles a day.

This took her from 230 to 180, another three months and she was down to 150. 

Her husband however was almost 400lbs and had no stamina from what she was telling me.

He always told her he was too tired to help with the kids or to do anything really other than go to work (Sit behind a desk and do nothing after getting home) and relax.

She started getting more active since now she had more energy from being generally more healthy.
She did the shopping so she bought healthy foods that her husband didn’t like and was always complaining.
After about a year and then 3 months of counseling that went nowhere she filed for divorce.

She ended up spending alimony on surgery to remove excess skin from being overweight and making herself feel better about her body in the mirror. Nothing enhancing just nipping and tucking where weight loss and exercise wasn’t fixing like tummy flab, arm flab etc.

She tells me all the time if she never lost her job and didn’t become a mail carrier that she would have been content to stay with him, but after getting in shape she realized how bad and toxic he was for her.

She tried to make it work and encouraged him to be better for himself (She didn’t want to have kids with a fat lazy slob anymore and I don’t blame her) but he showed no ambition or will to change.

She doesn’t feel bad at all about it and is now going out with an amazing guy that challenges her and supports her active lifestyle",1556669062

I'm glad they aren't just rushing out bullshit on a platter. As for everything ask it's basically what we asked for. Before legions rework was announced you didnt really find a lot of people who didnt hate him. Even then if you play him you will always get dcs so something had to be done. The end game collapse is a great idea. Not only does it solve the issue of people hanging around but it will also stop those pesky locker glitchers that hijack my games for 45 minutes. The only thing we never asked for it the pig rework which is something they took upon themselves to do because it seems like it made sense but it doesnt so I dont expect the changes to be the final outcome.

I posted about a month ago with a deadlift form video back then and my pain advice was to strengthen my posterior chain, start with my hips higher (to avoid having them shoot up), and keep the bar closer to my shins. I've been doing all that, but I'm still getting really bad lower back rounding (as seen in this video). What should I do?? I've been doing tons of beltless stiff-leg deadlifts to try and strengthen my posterior chain.

I've been scouring the Internet today and I've read that it might be weak hamstrings/glutes. Is that a possibility? (In other words, should I be adding some glute bridges and hamstring curls to my Greyskull program?) My knees also cave in when I do squats, which seems to support that theory.

**TL;DR: Form check on deadlifts please. Also, what might be the cause of my atrocious levels of lower back rounding? Also, should I stop deadlifting until I figure this out?**

Thanks so much!",1556669064

I would start with CoH as well. The core game rules are very clean and easy to learn. I would suggest playing at least one or two games without the solo module just to get the system down, then watch one of the excellent youtube videos on how to read the cards in the solo module. It takes a bit to wrap your head around the AI and target selection and action rules but once you do the games play really quickly.

I would point out that John Butterfield (the designer of the D-Day at ... series as well as Ambush and several other amazing solo wargames) was also a designer of the CoH solo rules which were subsequently licensed for use in the Lock-n-Load Tactical solo rules.

Also, you might want to start with D-Day at Peleliu rather than the earlier D-Day at Omaha Beach. The system is the same but somewhat cleaner rules and a bit more streamlined.",1556669064

That's not a bad thing, but I don't think these books are *currently* contributing anything to literature moreso than the other major fantasy series out there.  I think Martin *has* helped some people get back into reading, which is a special accomplishment IMO.  

The lore and complexity is what makes them exceptional, but Martin is really struggling with that complexity. What makes them great is probably also what will make them unfinished, and I have a hard time putting unfinished work on a pedestal.  

If he manages to finish the series or delegates someone who can, and the books are well done (i.e., wrapped up the dozens of plots well, and better in quality than the last two books), then he'll definitely have an argument for a top 3 fantasy series, and perhaps the most culturally significant one since LOTR.",1556669064

There was nothing wrong with the confession:

&gt; “The confessions were not coerced,” she explains, or else the trial court wouldn’t have found them admissible. The videotapes show that “the questioning was respectful, dignified, carried out according to the letter of the law and with sensitivity to the young age of the men. . . . If you spot the first sign of a coercive questioning, don’t hesitate to write to me and point it out.”
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/07/31/in-defense-of-the-central-park-5-prosecution/

The Reyes confession is dubious:

&gt; The D.A.'s report was based solely on the confession of Matias Reyes, career criminal, serial rapist and murderer. Reyes had absolutely nothing to lose by confessing to the rape -- the statute of limitations had run -- and much to gain by claiming he acted alone: He got a favorable prison transfer and the admiration of his fellow inmates for smearing the police. 
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2014-04-23.html

Multiple people participated in the assault:

&gt; Here’s the first big problem with the confession of the alleged lone rapist Reyes: his tale of being the only attacker goes against the medical evidence that indicates the Central Park Jogger was attacked by multiple people. Part of this evidence includes bruising on both legs of the victim indicating she was held down by more than one person and cuts from a blade (Reyes said he only hit her with a rock and tree branch).
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.askanewyorker.com/matt-sheahan/central-park-five-probably-guilty-will-soon-rich/

The five were involved in violent criminal activity that night:

&gt; For starters, no one has ever disputed that the Harlem thugs had been in Central Park that fateful evening for the sole purpose of assaulting and mugging innocents (one of whom had been bludgeoned with a pipe).  As is the wont of cowards, “the Five” set upon only those who they outnumbered, those who were weaker and more vulnerable.  This they confessed from the moment they were in police custody.
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/238071/central-park-five-still-guilty-jack-kerwick

The fact of another rapist was known:

&gt; However, Trump isn’t the only one who wasn’t entirely convinced that Reyes acted alone. A panel of three attorneys commissioned by the NYPD in 2003 believed that the Central Park Five were most likely involved in the attack, just not the rape. “Our examination of the facts leads us to suggest that there is an alternative theory of the attack upon the jogger, that both the defendants and Reyes assaulted her, perhaps successively,” the lawyers wrote in their report, according to a New York Times article.  They described their theory, saying that the Central Park Five attacked the woman first, and that “Mr. Reyes, drawn by her screams, either joined in the attack as it was ending or waited until the defendants had moved on to their next victims before descending upon her himself, raping her and inflicting upon her the brutal injuries that almost caused her death.”
&gt; 
&gt; https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/donald-trump-isnt-alone-in-believing-central-park-five-are-guilty/ quoting http://mobile.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/nyregion/boys-guilt-likely-in-rape-of-jogger-police-panel-says.html?pagewanted=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&amp;referer=

The facts of the case elude the Leftist media, as usual:

* The five were in the park committing violent crimes
* One them had semen and blood stained underwear
* They were seen in the vicinity of the attack at the time
* Several admitted it in uncoerced confessions
* Reyes also participated in the rape",1556669065

I get that its easy to point the blame at big pharma but the blame should be put on the person and their choices.

I thought they made him very horrible from the get go whereas I had thought it would have been a more gradual decline into evil. A slippery slope with his followers too, just slowly compromising more and more of their morality for ""the greater good"".

2. **Separating the Cost and Total into Two Separate Columns**: You can create a column dedicated solely to the cost and another solely dedicated to the total. Let's say your Column B contains the Cost Information and a cell within Column C will host your Total.  All you have to do is put =SUM(B:B) -- or =SUM(B2:B) if you have a header in the column -- in the cell within Column C. Every time you put a new numerical entry in Column B, the SUM will adjust accordingly.

libel
1) n. to publish in print (including pictures), writing or broadcast through radio, television or film, an untruth about another which will do harm to that person or his/her reputation, by tending to bring the target into ridicule, hatred, scorn or contempt of others. Libel is the written or broadcast form of defamation, distinguished from slander, which is oral defamation. It is a tort (civil wrong) making the person or entity (like a newspaper, magazine or political organization) open to a lawsuit for damages by the person who can prove the statement about him/her was a lie. Publication need only be to one person, but it must be a statement which claims to be fact and is not clearly identified as an opinion. While it is sometimes said that the person making the libelous statement must have been intentional and malicious, actually it need only be obvious that the statement would do harm and is untrue.",1556669071

My question is this, when he is sent back in time to put the stones back, how does he get to the real timeline to do so? The devices they have lets you go past in your timeline and start a new branch. Nowhere did they discuss labeling and going to specific branches. I suspect he went back and attempted to put stuff back in place, to only end up leaving two of each stone, not that it matters. I just dont get how he can come back to timeline a as old, because again he has no way to select a specific branch. Only way to come back to your branch is to use the main quantum machine, which bounces you back to your 'home'. But he didnt come back on the device, which means he time traveled to get there when he came back old.

My parents don't really believe mental health is a thing, at least not serious enough to be medically treated. My dad in particular thinks anti-depressants are seriously bad and that they're unnecessary. When I was younger I had issues with borderline personality disorder and they didn't handle it well. 

Moving away to somewhere they won't be aware of what I'm doing is a chance for me to develop a safe space in which to better myself. My girlfriend agrees with you and has encouraged me to see somebody before moving away. But I can't. I just can't. I would only be more of a disappointment to them. I feel like I would only be wasting the time of a therapist, I don't feel like I deserve the care. I feel so out of place in my own home. Thinking of trying to get treatment here gets me worked up and scared. I know it is stupid. I'm aware all of this is ridiculous and pitiful. 

People have told me not to self-harm before, but it helps. Not much and not for long, and not all that often. But there are nights that it is like the worst itch imaginable. But I'm a coward. I don't fully break the skin: the item I use isn't sharp enough for that. Instead it is like scoring paper. I wish I was brave enough to use something sharper, I might feel more then, but I'm not.

If the Unit is not able to close the distance to get into coherency, the unit stays put. That is it, there are no rules about a unit losing cover saves because they are out of coherency. Coherency is mentioned in the Big Rule book under ""Core Rules -&gt; Units"" And clarified in the Rule book FAQ.

As for Reanimation protocol, models that come back must be within 2"" of a Model that was already on the table and more than 1"" away from enemy Models.

Now, for your idea, Each enemy unit that shoots at the Warriors first checks LOS and Range before they shoot, if the Warriors are in Range each model in the unit then checks LOS and Range then the opponent rolls for the shots. Then once they cause wounds, and you start to apply them, you can actually lose models that might be out of LOS and Range.",1556669072

The problem is, though, people who share the opinions I mentioned above are ostracized and lied about, sent death threats, etc etc even though they /agree/ with tucutes, they just have a different definition.  


And then, powerful people in trans spaces will say ""truscum are evil, they hate nonbinary people, and they cannot share their experiences or opinions here"".  


It started out as a semantic argument but it's become an argument against transphobia. Truscum are called transphobes for a semantic argument and then are victim blamed for trying to exist in trans spaces. It's a horrible circular cycle where they are told they are gatekeeping (even though truscum are not in places of power) and are then gatekept by people in positions of power, banned from getting help, and then everyone is told that they brought it upon themselves for doing things that they, frankly, don't often do.  


Also, I really can't see clarifying the medical definition of dysphoria is in any way immoral or transphobic. Even people who don't experience significant distress (just incongruence or euphoria) still have dysphoria because they automatically meet 2 of the criterion to be diagnosed:

 

A strong desire to be treated as the other gender

A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender

&gt;Yeah it's not like the economy was on the brink of collapse when he took office! 

That is true, he did bring the country out of the recession, although some of his policies were very questionable. 

&gt;He also definitely didn't end the Iraq war OR start ramping down Afghanistan. Oh and he never even greenlit an operation to take down Osama Bin Laden.

He didn't end the Iraq War, because unless I'm very mistaken there are still *several* wars going on there, that we are most definitely still involved in. He also ordered the surge in Afghanistan (2009-2011, entirely during his presidency), another war which we are still involved in. Hence ""His legacy is one of expanding the war on terror"". He most certainly didn't reduce our involvement. 

&gt;take down Osama Bin Laden.

You're delusional if you think that can be credited to Obama. Killing OBL also didn't remove Al Qaeda, in fact they're arguably stronger today that they have been since 9/11.

&gt;He didn't successfully transition our energy industry

Trump has literally offered more subsidies and fast-tracking for the energy industry than Obama did, and he ran on making coal a thing again in his campaign. Feel free to look this up.

&gt; he never recouped our public image with the international community

That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - ""Call of Duty"", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and ""pressing F"". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice.

• A writer and a carpenter. ""Truth has no rank"" he wrote on his questionnaire according to one of the defense attorneys interviewing him during initial questioning. ""Is the truth a process at times?"" defense attorney Thomas Plunkett asked, to which he answered, ""yes.""

• A gynecologist who spoke to attorneys about bias she's faced as a person of color in her profession. People assume she's a nurse or a lab technician and challenge her knowledge as a physician.

• A young man who works as a restaurant host. He said he immigrated here from the Philippines. He said he's aware of incidents of police shootings through social media, especially involving black men.

• A man who said he immigrated from Ethiopia and works with surgical tools at a hospital.

• A firefighter and paramedic who said he knew three people on the prosecution's witness list. He said he works closely with Minneapolis police but thinks he would be fair.

• A man who says he immigrated from the Philippines and now works for the Department of Homeland Security as an immigration officer who adjudicates cases.

• A man who works in financial services. In questioning about bias in the criminal justice system, he said ""I believe it is possible that it exists and that there is data to support it"" but that his job as a juror is to focus on the facts of this case.

• An electrical foreman. He said he has military experience and has served on another jury in the past.

• A baker who leads groups on addiction and mental health. He's previously worked with people with special needs.

• A woman who works in a dental clinic. She said she immigrated from Pakistan.

• A woman who is a retired computer analyst who worked at Wells Fargo.

• A man who was concerned that he isn't qualified to serve on the jury in this case. The judge reassured him that he will come to a decision with the other members of the jury.

• A man who works as a software developer. He said in his questionnaire that the criminal justice system can be unfair. But during questioning he said that the justice system is imperfect, but that he believes in it.

• A woman who was laid off from her job in March. She is a gun owner who hunts deer and shoots clay pigeons for sport.

Serious Questions (Regarding Political Topics):

1. What is your opinion on centrism?
2. There are many varieties of conservatism (for example, paleoconservatism, neoconservatism, Burkean conservatism, etc.). What type of conservatism do you follow? If you agree with elements from multiple varieties of conservatism, which ones do you agree with?
3. Which philosophers, politicians, and books would you cite as your biggest influences?
4. What is your opinion on American foreign intervention (such as military operations)?
5. During the Cold War, the U.S. often supported dictators (such as former President Syngman Rhee of South Korea and former President Augusto Pinochet of Chile) to repel Communism. What is your opinion on this? If you approve of the U.S.'s past interventions to prevent Communism's spread, would you have preferred that the U.S. had set up republican governments in the places it had intervened in?
6. How much would you say your faith affects your political opinions?
7. How much of a place do you think political humor/memes should have in political discourse?

Non-Serious Questions (For The Memes, This is Reddit After All):

1. In response to u/Ready4TheAfterlife's question about whether you play Fortnite, you said no. Y U NO PLAY FORTNITE???
2. Why are you playing Roblox all the time? This is America, not Meep City.
3. A bunch of people with a kebab truck knock on your door and say that for every kebab you eat, you get $100. How many kebabs will you eat?
4. Is Doge a socialist? He keeps on knocking on my door and saying ""we need free healthcare, retard."" What do I do? He is hurting my feelings. :-(",1556669077
"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA, and OP I have to warn you to be very careful here with who might find out about this. 

Whether or not it's fair, some people would consider this concerning enough to contact CPS. I work with children and teens and have attended numerous seminars (edit: seminars about what to look for concerning possible abuse and neglect) and one of the things we're told to look out for is children participating in sexual behavior that is too mature for them. 

Everyone here is saying ""but 12 year olds masturbate"" and that is absolutely true. Children often begin to do so as young as 5. That's not the issue here, and hearing that a preteen was masturbating shouldn't raise red flags for anyone. Hearing that a 12-year-old has been given a SEX TOY by her PARENTS would ABSOLUTELY raise red flags for many people. It is not normal for her age, puberty or no she emotionally she is still a child.

Again, I'm not saying it's necessarily fair to you. I'm sure I'll get downvoted to oblivion just for mentioning this. But it had to be said, I really just want you to be aware that this could be a potential issue.",1556669077

So my advice is: tell him you’re interested in some BDSM and it sounds fun, but one thing is holding you back. Tell him how much you trust him and even though you know he wouldn’t hurt you it’s scary for you. And see what he says.
Make sure to tell him (and make sure you say it out loud) that he can ask you questions about your assault but you might not be ready to talk about all of it.

You say that alcohol doesn't have a grip on you, yet you also say that you don't drink without getting a buzz.  That is abusing it by definition, in fact that's binge drinking, and causes far more deaths.  Here's some real statistics for you: [""Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) each year in the United States from 2006 – 2010""](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm)."" [Drug overdose deaths rose from 8,048 in 1999 to 47,600 in 2017.](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates).  That's almost double the deaths just from *binge drinking* and not including anybody that died from alcohol withdrawals, liver failure, pancreatitis, or any of the other horrible ways alcohol kills you.  The fact that you see my comment as PRO heroin and not ANTI alcohol/addiction in general says a lot about the grip that it has over you.  I don't wish you any harm, but I do wish that you wouldn't see your drug of choice as any different from the less harmful drugs that we have people dying from for no reason.  For your information, I know exactly when I quit heroin because that's the day I found my ex-gf dead of an overdose in my bathroom, after I let her crash with me for the weekend after she left rehab.  She had agreed to go back on Monday, but Sunday night stole the $42 out of my wallet when I fell asleep, and I woke up to find her dead.  $42 is not enough to get a lethal dose of heroin.  The only way she died is because it was either cut with something lethal, or it was a wildly varying dose that was unexpected.  How the FUCK is wanting unnecessary deaths to be eliminated by taking the power away from the criminals at all defending heroin use?  Heroin should be available from MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS for EXISTING ADDICTS as part of a MEDICALLY SUPERVISED TREATMENT PROGRAM to either get them off the drugs completely, or remove the criminal element completely from it.  If caffeine was illegal it would be sold for the same large amounts by the same cartels with the same things cut in it, and people would be overdosing and robbing people for it just the same as they are now for the drugs we arbitrarily treat people like criminals and animals for having the DISEASE of addiction to.  I know you only are saying the things you are out of ignorance, and a false belief that you slapping/punching/whatever the fuck an addict is going to do anything to make them stop rather than just make them cut you out of their life, which is what would actually happen, but please, try to think about this objectively.  Your feelings and anger at someone else's particular drug don't make it worse than your drug.",1556669078

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","Okay. Let's address it directly then.  


Sentience is [a sentient quality or state](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sentience), and sentient itself is defined as [responsive to or conscious of sense impressions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sentient). Also [some](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sentience) [alternate](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sentient) [definitions](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sentient).  


Here in this thread, I'm being asked 'Why is it wrong to kill something if it has the ability to feel?'  


Without knowing much about the morality of the person in question, I need to find out exactly where our opinions differ such that they're okay with killing animals. I start with 'Why is it wrong to hurt other people?' and the answers vary, but the general goal of the question is to eventually show that hurting other people is wrong because people have the ability *to perceive or feel things/ are* *responsive to or conscious of sense impressions/ have* *the* *quality* *of being* *able* *to* *experience* *feelings**.*   


We can assign a value to those 'sense impressions' or 'feelings' that an individual has without actually valuing them ourselves. Like.. I don't need to care about the guy across the city who recently bought a riverside house, but I can understand that it's a +X to his experience, while getting into a car accident and losing his leg would be -X to his experience. Since I'm human and feel like the other humans do, I understand that -X experiences are unpleasant and that humans try to avoid them, and that +X experiences are pleasant and humans tend to seek them out.

&amp;#x200B;

I would not want to harm another person because I have been harmed and don't want other people to have the same experiences. I would not want to hold them back from a positive experience because I have been held back from positive experiences. That is to say: My own experience with pain and the knowledge that other people feel the way I do; that's the basis of my interpersonal morality. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things get a little more complicated when we introduce the concepts of [rights](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/rights/) ([wikipedia article on rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights))  and [hurt](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hurt)/[harm.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/harm)  The article on rights is based in Kantian thought and I'd like to focus on the concept of 'negative rights'. First though, what is a right? From the article:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; A right is a justified claim on others. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Negative rights, such as the right to privacy, the right not to be killed, or the right to do what one wants with one's property, are rights that protect some form of human freedom or liberty, . These rights are called negative rights because such rights are a claim by one person that imposes a ""negative"" duty on all others—the duty not to interfere with a person's activities in a certain area. The right to privacy, for example, imposes on us the duty not to intrude into the private activities of a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

What gives people negative rights? Why should you give a person privacy, or allow them to do as they please with their property, or not harm them? Well it's because you recognize that it negatively impacts their experiences, as you can imagine your experiences would be negatively impacted by harmful actions.  


I understand that this has mostly been tautology up until now but it's important to set the groundwork with people. **It's wrong to hurt people because people feel it when you hurt them.** Alternatively: It's wrong to hurt people because they're capable of positive experiences and you deny them future positive experiences by hurting them. In both cases, the 'wrongness' of hurting a person comes from their ability to have experiences. It's the familiarity of being a person ourselves that allows us a clear understanding of those experiences.  


So how does all this relate to animals? Well you're all smart so I'm pretty sure you can see where I'm going with this. The systems that produce our conscious experiences are present in [other animals](http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf): 

&gt;The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. 

Since it's wrong to hurt people because people feel it when you hurt them... **It's wrong to hurt animals because animals feel it when you hurt them**. Feeling/sentience/consciousness is literally the thing humans base morality on. It's just that humans are unfamiliar with experiencing what a dog/cow/cat/chicken/gazelle experiences and we're generally not good at assigning it the value it deserves.",1556669079

The other minimum requirements include: being a U.S citizen, having a valid driver's license, and being at least 18 or 21 years old (it depends). You'll also need a clean criminal record.

Also, ""has a human-like figure"" --&gt; ""is a humanoid entity"".

The statement ""It doesn't kill"" is out of place, since there's no reason for a reader to have that impression of Euclid. I would omit that.

Your description of the testing just needs to redone completely.

When you make your SCP ""allowed to interact"" with other SCPs, please check their containment procedures. SCP-049 isn't allowed to interact with other SCPs. It needs to be heavily sedated whenever it's transported anywhere.

Lastly, you keep saying ""infect"" in little single-quotes. It's annoying and ultimately pointless. Omit the apostrophes and just use the word. It's a perfectly good word to use.

In a random sample of all life on earth most deaths would be attributed to microorganisms.

​

The movie (or Thanos) doesn't really understand what random sampling means. You don't lose 50% of all species with random sampling. The higher populated species would lose more and the lesser populated species would lose less. What Thanos wanted was actually the opposite of what he claimed which is ""selective sampling.""

The flag buffs on enemies makes it easier to see them, so those that actually do damage can acquire new targets quicker.

Cheerleaders have a real effect on Sports, True Patriot is just missing the pom poms. (and waggling pom-poms at the enemy would do more damage than a True Patriot Player's guns would.)

The real issue is that the type of player who looks at the True Patiot set and says, ""yes, this I will equip"" is also unlikely to be able to reliably spot said targets in the first place, and then land a shot on them.

If you have 300K armor right now you likely have 350K+ once the PTS goes live.

That means that the new UF (2% per 25K) will still give you 28% more damage.

Title: **Neighbor is building directly in my backyard, after promising he wouldn’t**

Original Post: 

&gt; Quick background: a local business owner buys plots of land and develops them as a hobby.  Where my house is, was a large plot of land that he divided. When we bought the house 5 years ago, he said (obviously we didn’t get it writing, stupid us) that our house was the last he was building, except for a house for himself far in back of us where we would barely see it (which is true) but wanted to keep between us undeveloped because he wanted all that space empty.
&gt; 
&gt; A few months ago, an excavator, bulldozer and dump truck show up and start clearing trees, moving dirt, flattening the land.  I’m not on good terms with the guy so I call the town planner and ask if any permits were filed because there is obviously something going on.  He calls me back 30 minutes later and says, “I talked to David (the developer) and he says he is just cleaning land and moving dirt around. It’s his property so he can do what he wants.”
&gt; 
&gt; Notice he did not answer the question.
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, the excavator and bulldozer have worked feet from my fence (built on property line), including to the side of my house (maybe he’s putting in a road?)
&gt; 
&gt; At this pony my concerns are twofold: 
&gt; 
&gt; how can I get an answer / prevent what is going on behind me? I have tried tracking him down but have had no luck.
&gt; 
&gt; What can I do to assure that no damage is done to my property, including my fence? I am worried that because he is lowering the land around my fence, rain will dislodge the dirt under the fence and create holes under the fence.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance everyone!

Actually interesting that all three of these are ones within the period where Earth's population has covered a lot more area than the past, and still all three weren't significant in death tolls. Chelyabinsk was the closest but because of its angle only did its damage through a high altitude shock wave, not an impact.

Doesn't mean tomorrow we couldn't get a direct hit in a high population area, but even with people covering large areas now, the Earth still has a lot more isolated places that are more likely to get hit. 75% water, there's probably a lot of impacts that we totally miss.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","**""I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one guy and I ran away""**, explains the protagonist of The Lord of the Rings

&amp;#x200B;

The popular and much loved character of the Lord of the Rings, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, would surely have faced them sword in hand. But the actor, the real person, has been more cautious. The fact is that the Argentine actor, who has never hidden his passion for football and more specifically for the San Lorenzo de Almagro, to the point that he took a pin from his club during the last Oscars Awards, has explained how he escaped a dangerous brawl with ultras from Real Madrid.

The radical fans attacked him thinking he was a Barcelona fan. It happened in 2006 when Viggo Mortensen, who was immersed in the shooting of Captain Alatriste's film, was mistaken for a Barça supporter.

The actor decided to tell the anecdote 13 years later. It was the day in which his team lost 1-7 against Boca, a match he saw in Madrid with director Agustín Díaz Yanes. The director invited him to dinner at his house, preparing for the occasion. ""I took flags, shirts, hats, scarves ... Then they make us a goal, two goals, three goals ... I sank in the armchair"", reveals in radio 'Vorterix'.

However, the worst came after the game. ""I was in the Puerta del Sol, the ultras saw the colors of my clothing and thought i was a Barça supporter. Those bald guys started to say ugly things and hitting me. I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one and I ran away. ""

When arriving at the house of Agustín Díaz Yanes, the director asked him if it was blood what he wore on his shirt. Not to worry his friend, he said no, that it was wine.",1556669086

Your posting rate was rapid &amp; you were working out ideas as you wrote them to guys who are DEEPLY damaged by this stigma.  
I believe your intentions were noble but your methods would burn you out.  
That's why I chimed in both in my message to you &amp; on this recent thread you contributed to.

[**A Message to Koosobie**](https://www.reddit.com/r/smalldickproblems/comments/awdgf1/a_message_to_koosobie/)  
[**Just discovered this subreddit and I find people has somewhat defeatist attitude**](https://www.reddit.com/r/smalldickproblems/comments/bi2fft/just_discovered_this_subreddit_and_i_find_people/)  


I see it so often from so many women who visit this board.  
They don't have a good understanding about this problem being female &amp; it's hard to deal with angry men who feel they have no hope.  
That's why I tried to help you, koosobie. Your approach would be emotionally draining. You needed a foundation to work from.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regardless of your feelings about me, thank you for your contributions to this board, koosobie.**  
Some men here were helped by your approach. I thought it was innovative &amp; could be a valuable asset to the forum.  
Like I said to you before, I'll say to you again. The more people we have working on this issue, the better.  
And it's more important that WOMEN understand this issue even more than Outsider MEN.

Maybe one day, you'll change your mind &amp; return to the forum once you cool down.  
If you do, I would like to work with you so your message will land better.  
I will ALSO give you tips to grow the necessary thick skin you will need to withstand the pressure from the men here who suffer from this stigma. They are **RIGHTFULLY** distrustful &amp; skeptical of all Outsiders because how much they are gaslighted &amp; bullied.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first came here, hardly nobody trusted me or believed a damn thing I said.  
I was fine with that. I grew up watching pro wrestling. I understand the whole thing about Heels, Tweeners, &amp; Faces.  
I understand Heat. So I came in knowing I had to **EARN** their respect. I respected them &amp; eventually they would respect me.  
Even now, some STILL don't like my presence here. But day by day I win them over.  
This is **THEIR** house not mine. I am the **GUEST** here. Eventually I will be trusted as the Family Friend.  
Until that time I will have to withstand the slings &amp; arrows. I have to catch the BOOS. I have to take the HEAT to stay in this kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

And one more thing...Even in your anger, don't be disdainful of these men here despite it all.  
You NOW understand something of how SERIOUS this **Small Penis Self-Image Crisis** is.  
These men are **traumatized** &amp; that's where the negativity comes from. Try your best not to be angry at them.  
And don't continue the current cultural cycle of scorn towards them in your online &amp; offline life.  
NOW you know how difficult the problem is &amp; why it causes road blocks not only in Body Positivity but even Male-Female relations.

I hope that if you DO return, you come back with a HEFTIER resolve &amp; a STRONGER determination to address this issue.  
Your drive was admirable.

CO2 spikes have happened before in Earth's geological history… but there hasn't been a natural reason for THIS spike… and it's quite a fucking massive spike. So when you break it down it looks like this:

- We know that CO2 warms the planet.
- We know that CO2 can be released in massive quantities naturally because that's happened before.
- We know that such a massive natural release hasn't happened recently.
- We know that a massive man-made release has been happening constantly for the last century+
- We can see from records and ice sampling that the recent CO2 releases are very significant.
- When you add all that up, **we are the volcano.**

This is also very basic logic.

Some people like to argue that the amount we release is small compared to massive volcanoes, which is true, but it's also CONSTANT. We're doing it 24/7 for over a hundred years and we're doing more and more every day. Over time this adds up to something which should concern everyone.",1556669087

http://watchersonthewall.com/the-fall-of-lysa-arryn-an-interview-with-kate-dickie/

It's an interview &amp; here is the relavant part:

Oz: I understand that a prosthetic was used, but even so how did you and Lino Facioli (Robin Arryn) prepare for what I presume was a very uncomfortable scene?

KD: Yes we used prosthetic breasts, I hope people know this! ",1556669087

"rawdenim","t5_2scl9","I'm a big fan of PBJ.  I've got the XX-019, XX-019-WID, and the relaxed (019) cut chinos.  I think construction is top notch, and their dye is really great.  They don't have a ton of features though, with no half-lined back pockets, somewhat flimsy pocket bags (I've blown out a pocket in both pairs of jeans), and no branding on the rivets.  The cut obviously works well for me: it's one of very few cuts that gives me the thigh measurements I need without an oversized waist.  At the same time, it's not TOO tapered - which is the reason I've never gone for the Oni 902...I'd never be able to get my foot through a 6.1"" opening.  As for the price, I bought mine on sale during one of Okayama Denim's 2-3 annual sales, which makes them about the same as a non-discounted Oni.  I'd have a hard time paying full retail for them, especially non-Japanese pricing, but that's more about my cheapness than anything to do with quality or value.",1556669087

I've honestly never watched a full one (bc I agree about CNN), but I have seen snippets on youtube, etc. where she seems to do hold her ground and make good points.",1556669087
