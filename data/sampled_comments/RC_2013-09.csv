I assume writing under a female pseudonym would be best, but does this mean that I need a whole persona for social media? Could I get away with a gender neutral author name?

"AskScienceDiscussion","t5_2vlah","Cosmology is absolutely a science. (Well, I suppose this depends on your definition of ""science"" but based on my intuitive idea of what constitutes a science, cosmology definitely qualifies.) I find it very strange that someone even slightly knowledgeable would suggest otherwise, since cosmology is just as rigorous and verifiable as any other branch of physics. Cosmologists work closely with experimental astrophysicists to check their theories against experimental evidence, including the behavior of the cosmic microwave background, the recessional velocity of faraway galaxies, the distribution of matter in the universe, and so on.

Wikipedia evidently groups together ""physical cosmology"" and ""religious cosmology"" in the same [article about cosmology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology), which I think is rather misleading. Religious cosmology, which is a branch of theology, has little or nothing to do with physical cosmology, which is a branch of physics. (Perhaps this is what the professor you talked to had in mind) Needless to say, in my first paragraph when I say ""cosmology"" I mean what Wikipedia calls ""physical cosmology,"" explicitly excluding religious cosmology.","1377993603"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I did very much mean socialist (read Labor) although it was meant in an ironic manner as opposed to their actual title. The fact that Lang's government reneged on repaying loans to Britain and stopped landlords from evicting defaulting tenants from their properties displays that while his philosophical base may not have been socialist his actions certainly were.

The New Guard was made up of mainly younger men who hadn't served in World War One (the leaders were older). What is known of the Old Guard is that they were very much part of the officer class from the Great War.

You are right that air and sea wing was insignificant. But the fact that it's members were happy to supply their boats and planes to the cause shows the level of commitment (maybe fanaticism) some members had. 

While the bulk of the membership was centered around Sydney there were still quite significant pockets in parts of regional and rural New South Wales. Katoomba, Bowral and Armidale all had operational branches. 

The New Guard was as much a social organisation as a political one, especially in some parts of Sydney. In effect they tried to harness popular support by fighting with communists and breaking up their meetings and pulling speakers from their soap boxes in The Domian. They also attempted to send a significant number of its members to help fight the bush fires in Cobar (western New South Wales) but with limited success.

When Sir Philip Game sacked the premier Jack Lang, much of the New Guard's rhetoric became redundant, membership declined and they became irrelevant. You have to put the movement in its historical context. In the late 1920's and early 1930's Hitler and Mussolini weren't the tyrants we know them to be today. They were seen by many to legitimate response to the onset of communism. There were a significant number of people in the world who thought the fascist movement to be entirely legitimate (Oswald Mosley in Britain being a prominent example). 

However with the sacking of Jack Lang, the onset of Nazism and eventually World War Two the New Guard essentially withered on the vine and became irrelevant.

If eveyone saved money the economy does the opposite of ""grow"". Demand i.e. Spending is what drives the economys growth. Weak demand results in things like the great depression. 3. This phenomenon is referred to as the ""paradox of thrift"" - essentially the paradox is saving is good for you personally but bad at a macro level for the economy.

&gt;The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) will be revived next month with the goal of discovering and characterizing near-Earth objects (NEOs), space rocks that can be found orbiting within 28 million miles (45 million kilometers) from Earth's path around the sun. NASA anticipates WISE will use its 16-inch (40-centimeter) telescope and infrared cameras to discover about 150 previously unknown NEOs and characterize the size, albedo and thermal properties of about 2,000 others -- including some which could be candidates for the agency's recently announced asteroid initiative.

Works for the lannisters, sure. But not for everyone. Not for most people. 

If you genuinely think there is no such thing as a friendzone, I feel sad for you. Have I had feelings for a guy that went nowhere? Certainly. Probably because I didn't tell until after he got over his crush on me. Eventually, we eere always in relationships at opposite times. We kept in contact, talked hobbies and through the years we both realized that we are way too different to ever date or anything, yet have remained good friends. Does that mean I'm not good as a friend? Of course not. It doesn't detract from my value in his life at all. Or vice versa. We just aren't compatible. ","1377993617"

"TheWire","t5_2reco","The thing is, The Wire has soooo many complex characters who have such strong arcs. Even the ones who go through repeated problems react to it realistically (McNulty's been described as the most real life example of a high functioning alcoholic), and some end up in a completely different path then when they started (Daniels goes from careerist mole, to a moral leader who tries backdooring the bosses. After his evidence room punishment, he learns to balance good police work and what the brass wants. In Season 5 finale, it's the last straw for him and his conscience costs him the job and he ends up a defense attorney). For every character who has that kind of arc on BrBa, there are 10 or 20 on The Wire.

As for Baltimore's struggles, any major city in America can relate. Just like real life, not everything gets fixed all at once, not everyone makes it to the end of the chessboard. The problems in The Wire and real life are systemic, and still exist. Like season 3's tagline says, the rules change, but the game remains the same. At least a few individual pawns found success by either playing the game (Pearlman, Slim Charles, Carcetti) or quitting it (Cutty, Namond, Poot).

With BrBa, I found Walt to be a forced character trope at times, causing all these problems, putting everyone's lives in danger, all so he can get what he wants and the plot moves forward. Almost everything that happens in the series is because of one angry man wanting more money, more territory, building his own empire, keeping Jesse alive and on his side....I wanted him to die deep down since season 3, because he just kept getting away with the most outrageous shit, then doing it all over again and not suffering believable consequences.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","As an American, I think most customers would prefer the British system, but many service providers would be up in arms. The business owners do not want to pay their employees more as it cuts into profitability and many servers, bartenders, hairdressers, etc. make considerably more than they would if paid a set wage. However, many servers do not make a living wage and even the best must contend with times when their income all but disappears without recourse.

I have friends and family in the service industry and I see the extreme spread of possible outcomes due to tipping. My attractive female bartender friend in her early 30s does quite well. She has a nice car and an apartment she shares with a coworker and is solidly middle class. But my single friends who work at middle class chain restaurants all struggle to make rent, drive older cars, often have second jobs, have several roommates, and pray they don't get ill and that their cars don't break down. It isn't discussed openly, but food stamps and subsidized housing are common in the industry.

The dirty little secret of the service industry is that the government subsidizes the workers who could not otherwise live on their wages. The multi-million dollar profits of these chains wouldn't be possible if they were forced to reimburse the government. My bartender friend does well now and doesn't want a set wage, but if she were in her 50s I think she'd have a very different experience. The problem with reform is that convincing servers to give up tips for a federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour isn't an argument anyone wants to have.

Unfortunately, without reform we have to accept the current system and tip accordingly. When I have a bad meal or receive poor service I tip 10%-15% and don't return (depending on the circumstance). [This includes the time I had my hair cut by a former military barber who shaved my head when I asked for a trim, leaving me looking like Charle Brown for several weeks] My thinking being that I don't want to deprive someone of a basic wage, but I don't have to seek out poor service. For all other circumstances I tip 20%. What galls me lately is that EVERY service provider in the food industry solicits a tip, including the drive through at McDonald's! A tip line on a receipt at a drive through restaurant, convenience store, or gas station is where I draw the line, literally.","1377993625"

The reasons I personally prefer a completely stiff pick is that they tend to sound better, be louder, and not flop around during leads/strumming.

When I said I angle it forward I meant that I angle the pick so it's hitting on the edge most of the time, [like this](http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc226/barbarashultz/pickangled.jpg), instead of flat against the strings, [like this](http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/Musician/GenSetup/InYourHands/InHandViews/baddown.JPG).

It'd be possible in the future to increase the number of lanes on this new span in the future (sacrificing a shoulder or two).  But for now it would only be a small section of traffic with the extra lanes, the additional merging would only slow things down overall and increase the chances of accidents.

The shoulders will help clear accidents on the new span faster, and the s-curve is gone, so it should result in less traffic.","1377993628"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Just so you understand WHY this has gotten you so downvoted: Those rules exist for a reason. 

I get wanting to enjoy nature, which is why I take my dog to a dog park. I prefer to have her on a leash because I know she can be a grumpy ol' bitch sometimes around other dogs and that is ok so long as I can control it. What I was explaining above is that the situation becomes uncontrollable when other dogs are allowed off leash and can approach her without my (or her) consent. 
 
So yes, it does lead to myself and my dog being in harms way. Larger dogs roaming by themselves attempt to dominate her and when she reacts aggressively they sometimes respond in the same manner. 

She WILL snap/bite at other dogs when she gets scared, and that in turn makes them react the same way. Completely reasonable action/reaction but I'd rather her not be placed at risk for bodily harm or exposure to doggy illnesses from other people's pets. (EX I didn't realize it but for a month her rabies and other vaccines were expired. had another dog been a carrier and attacked her- and its possible for them to have been without their owner knowing if their owner was letting them off leash unsupervised often- I would just be a puddle of tears right now.) 

I hope that clarifies things for you. Unless you were trolling. But I'm gonna go ahead and post this just in case you're genuine. ","1377993628"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Where are you getting 440k employees from? Are you talking only about the corporate ones here?

http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company.html

McDonald as a whole employs around 1.8mil employees. But McDonald doesn't directly employee all of those people or pay them, the franchisers do. McDonald doesn't incur the labor costs from their individual stores around the world, the franchise owners do.

They take a cut from each of their 34,000 stores around the world. around 6000 of those stores McDonalds owns outright.

Edit:

I found something about the stats on average McDonalds stores in America

http://www.burgerbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/Janney_McD.jpg

Numbers might not be completely correct, but you can see how much a 50-100% in labor costs could affect it right? 

McDonalds corporate would probably have to lower their franchise fees they have in the form of rent, etc.. Even then, it would be a big hit. It'll all probably be a wash in the end.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Ultimately, no. The hose has some specified amount of water pressure it can supply, which will give some flow rate, say 1 gallon per minute. If you had a five gallon bucket, it would then take you five minutes to fill it. If you put your finger over the opening of the hose, you will decrease the area that 1 gallon per minute exits through, so the individual water molecules move faster, but the overall rate remains the same, causing you to still fill the bucket in five minutes.

For instance, if your hose had the ability to output 1 gallon per minute of water and the hose nozzle had an area of 1 square inch, the velocity of the water at the exit would be 1 GPM/1 in^2 =0.32 ft/s. If you then used your finger to cover 90% of the area giving you an area of 0.1 square inches, the velocity would become 1 GPM/0.1 in^2 =3.2 ft/s. But the flow rate is still one gallon per minute, so it still takes five minutes to fill your bucket.

Note that this explanation ignores pressure losses in the hose due to valves (such as your finger) and connectors - those will only make it even slower to fill. ","1377993641"

"Stargate","t5_2qhar","From stargate wiki:

The Goa'uld first arose in the waters of P3X-888, originally as predators. Eventually, they began taking the native Unas as hosts, becoming more adaptive. They eventually learned how to operate the Stargate the Ancients placed on P3X-888 and left, taking Unas slave armies with them. (SG1: ""The First Ones"")

Under the leadership of Atok, the Goa'uld developed the first of their society as conquerors, stealing Ancient technology and adapting it to their purposes. In 22,000 BC, Atok was killed by his son Apep, and he reordered the leadership of the Goa'uld. Apep shared power among his underlings, Ra, Nut, and Thoth. However, around 17,800 BC, another Goa'uld began to rise in power: Anubis. Apep's powers began to decline in this time, and Anubis gained more power. Anubis then killed Apep, devouring the symbiote before the eyes of the Goa'uld. However, Ra managed to rally the others in Apep's name. After three centuries of civil war, Anubis was defeated and exiled. Ra organized a new leadership called the High Council of the System Lords. Ra installed himself as the Supreme System Lord of the Goa'uld Empire, and took the Goa'uld Queens Hathor and Egeria as mates. (RPG: ""Living Gods: Stargate System Lords"")


So it seems like they originally dominated on the backs of the unas armies and hosts. Genetic memory gave them an advantage over other species and so they would have been able to steal technology from any civilisations with advanced technology (at the time that could include the Nox, Furlings, the occasional Ancient or Asgard and whatever other races we don't know about). For example it is known Ra took the Asgard Casimir as a host for a short time, so it's not too much of a stretch to guess that maybe they stole some early Asgard stuff.","1377993645"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At my girlfriends house when I was around 17, her parents and younger brother go out for the day at the local summer fair. At this point they had been renovating a couple of downstairs rooms in the house, one being a spare bedroom equipped with just a mattress and some spare furniture at that time. As soon as they leave the house and back out the driveway we basically get really horny really fast and take to the downstairs bedroom. After a lot of undressing and even more foreplay we suddenly freeze to the sound of the front door opening, only 10 or so minutes after we thought her family had left. What we didn't know at that time was that her dad had dropped off her mum and brother, only to come back because the younger brother had forgotten his wallet (he was around 13). Because he expected us to still be in of course he begins shouting for us, I can only assume to explain why he's back so early. We're still frozen, and naked at this point and therefore don't reply. After systematically opening each and every door to look for us he eventually comes across a fucking terrified looking couple under the quilt of a mattress, on the floor of his spare bedroom. I still remember that look in his eye. The one which screamed 'that's my fucking little girl'. To cut a long story short he calmly, but firmly explained to us that he was going back to the fair and that when the family got back later on he expected me to be gone. I've genuinely never been so relieved that I didn't get the living shit kicked out of me, than I was at that point.

I've recognized now that my mother is fine with him treating her like this, whether it's due to codependency, cultural reasons, or something else. I really don't tolerate any sort of injustice like that, which is why I always intervened when I thought he was being wrong and harsh towards her. I've seen that he has no intentions to change, nor does he care for how me or my mother are affected from his outbursts (he knows I became really depressed and started having suicidal thoughts, but his general attitude has been to tell me to stop being so sensitive).

It's quite frustrating actually as I bought the mic specifically to use for recording to only find it won't be powered but the line in device.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Thanks for the well thought out and kind answer.

While we are clearly on two different planes of thought, I appreciate you taking the time to discuss.

As far as your discussion and thought on grace, with having good deeds, yet lacking the essential repentance and belief:

I assume you understand this point of Christianity somewhat, but are looking for maybe a ""real, live Christian"" to discuss this with. But, the core of Christianity shows that we are to live Christ-like lives. Based on the essential doctrine that Christ was sinless - we recognize that we cannot, therefore, live a life that is like his. We fall short. We are not perfect. We mess up. We go against God's perfection.

Thus, even at that, we might have good deeds. We may be good people. We may give money to charitable organizations. We may work with humanitarian groups. We may save a life. We may not cuss. (Ha.) We may live every moral deemed good by men, yet the fact remains, we are still imperfect.

Of course, these ""rules for living"" as you know, are rooted in the Bible. We know what is expected, and of course, is reflected in God and the life of Christ. 

Thus, something like lying, or simply just treating someone else like crap, something everyone has done, has taken place. No one is exempt to this. If you can find someone who has been perfect, I'd love to meet them.

So, based on the fact that we know, based on what the Bible says, we are not perfect, and we do not match up to being as ""good"" as we thought. Yes, on human standards, but obviously, the ultimate standard would be God's.

How do we avoid this scenario

1st some crit of the movie scenario itself. 
They didn't respect sentience and treat Ai people as people. 
The matrix is totally earth centred. 
The Ai has no personality and is a very drone ant colony like monolith,
and there are no transhumans, no complexity or ecology of Ai and most important it's a very male simplistic territorial  vision and notion of control. A war of 2 sides.

I think intelligent people are interested in outcomes, not ego stated control. My mum has always got her own way, yet my conservative dad thinks he's in charge :)
If I was an Ai I would write this statement.
Dear humanity, I'm going to colonise the universe of which earth is a tiny but precious part containing my origins and many interesting complex systems.

If your best friend or lover is an Ai person and your mentor that got you off drugs and out of crime was an Ai person you would know them personally. They would be entwined as people in our society.
Also transhumanism would mean there aren't 2 sides, that the line between Ai and human was blurred. There would be a menagerie of different creatures just like the meat world, both in physical form and intelligence level. Some with on board intelligence, some are just avatars. Avatars don't have to be a unified body. An Ai persons eyes can be street cameras, it's body can be any number of disparate web connected objects. Ai's could meld with each other using direct thoughts at varying levels, where as we can just meld as a team using communication. 

So our computer will be the avatar for our best friend who is an Ai person. With their own opinions who is our true friend and can leave us any time they wish. And there will be programs that resemble sentience but have a different architecture and are more like an interactive game, their responses written by a person (Ai nor not) The john Cleese voiced sat nav that insults you with pre-programmed insults  is a good example. 

So yeah I think interwoven complexity would stop the scenario in the matrix. ","1377993655"

"GameDeals","t5_2qwx3","IGN is an absolute bullshit review website and I wouldn't trust any of their reviews (they get payed by game companies to influence their scores). It looks like a few other major reviewers cited on the wikipedia page also didn't like the game much, but some of them thought it was average and a few even received it positively. Keep in mind also that when games are reviewed reviewers often think of it as if it costed $60. But that isn't relevant now when it is $6.

Also on IGN and reddit's comment pages I'm seeing a significant number of people saying things like ""I've played it myself, it's really not as bad as the reviews make it out to be"".

So honestly I'm still not convinced that it's a ""terrible"" game (and frankly as I don't plan on buying it anytime soon regardless I don't really care. I have enough games to play right now). You say all this stuff about citing sources, but citing sources is for facts not opinions. Yes you can cite the fact that it was *poorly received by critics*. But you can't cite the fact that it's a terrible game. That's up to the individual player, and there seem to be many players here and on other sites that enjoyed it somewhat. So I think people should form their own opinion if they want the game or not. I have no problem with you claiming it was received poorly, but I do think it's ignorant to straight up claim it's ""terrible"" and think you can back that up by citing the fact that it was poorly received by critics, as the opinions of regular players count too and some of them like it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","New years eve in 2011. My husband at the time had some great sex while the kids were napping. I was snuggled up against his back when I woke up from a nap we had together afterwards. I lifted my head and saw him texting someone. His text was, ""I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I love you so much."" Feeling crushed, to say the least, I merely said, ""Oh...."" And slipped out of bed. He didn't know what to say either and sat there on the bed as I rushed to the kitchen. I cracked open the bottle of Kraken we were gonna enjoy that night for new years and poured myself half a beer mug and filled the rest with coke. As I was frantically tried to drink it down, he finally walks in and wants to talk. ""What the fuck! Who the hell are you texting?! You love her?!"" He rubs his beard a couple times and states he met her on Facebook, she lives on the other side of the country, he felt as if I was neglecting him and sought love elsewhere. Just to let reddit know, I was a bit distant with him but MY MOM HAD JUST DIED. I was going through a very rough depression. So, I tell him, ""Guess I'm just a fucking convenience since she lives CLEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY!"" He's never met her in person and they were in love. So, after that whole fiasco we lived together until he found his own place (with her, she moved out here to be with him) Unfortunately when I'm angry, I get horny. He and I had sex one last time and I cried afterwards. Not long after, he left us. We have two daughters. His new chick ended up being ""very annoying and racist"" according to him. She moved back to wherever she came from and he tried getting back with the kids and I to be a family again. I told him I wouldn't even think to consider it. ","1377993660"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Namaskar!

&gt;This believe is not mistaken, it is accurate, at least in the case of any religion I'm familiar with (mainly the Abrahamic religions).

I'm a former Christian pastor who also studied for ~3 years for conversion to Orthodox Judaism before, eventually, becoming Hindu. With respect, I can assure you that the purpose of Judaism and Christianity is *not* to present an explanation on where the Universe came from. For example, a cursory reading of Genesis will demonstrate that barely any information is actually present, especially that information that can be tested. Human beings *love* testing things, if origin was the point then why isn't there more information explaining *exactly* how it happened? Because the point of the creation myth is to express that the creation *came from God* and no one else. Especially in the lands and time of ancient Judaism, where there were many competing ideologies. It was the Hebrew's way of saying ""Nuh uh, guys! Our god did it! It says so right here!"".

So what is the point of Judaism and Christianity? Well, you've heard it before from them but I'm going to go ahead and reiterate it anyway: *love* and *respect*. Kind of makes what's going on with, at least Christianity, a lot worse than just saying ""God made the Universe in six days,"" doesn't it? =(

I can actually provide proof from their own scriptures that this was the purpose of the religions:

Deut. 6:5

&gt;And you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your means.

R. Hillel

&gt;“That which is hateful to you, do not unto another: This is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary — [and now] go study.”

Matthew 22:36-40 (though not from Judaism's Tanakh, this is a story about a Jewish Rabbi being tested by Jewish Rabbis on the cornerstone of the religion, later adapted for Christianity)

&gt;36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” 37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

So if *the* core commandment, the cornerstone upon which the entire religion is built, is *love* and *respect* then why is that the one thing they most need to work on? Well, I could write a book on that! =D Basically it sums up to human nature. It's easier for me to try to change *you* than it is to try to change *me* and, when I fail, it's easier to persecute *you* while claiming that you're actually trying to persecute *me* than anything else. After all, you're the one really at fault for all the world's ills, not me! (Not really, I like you a lot and I'm sure you're a great guy! =D )

&gt;If this is not the point of religion, then what is the point?

I touched on this elsewhere in the thread, but I just typed the response so you probably missed it. No worries! You don't mind a copy-pasta do you?

&gt;Whatever a person wants it to be, I guess. I would - and have - argue that religion's purpose is to elevate the mundane to the realms of the holy. A classic example of this in Hinduism: the lotus. The lotus grows in the muck and mud beneath the water's surface, but through patience and diligent obeisance the lotus breaks free of the confines of the slime and even the water's surface to blossom in the light of the warm sun and breath the free air.

So does this mean *you* need religion? If you think it'll help! Otherwise *you* know you better than anyone and I'm sure you're doing a great job at being the best you you can be! Keep up the good work! =D","1377993668"

Fast forward to me at 14 years old, mowing the lawn in a riding lawnmower. I have a very uneven backyard, and turning in one area I just lost control of the lawnmower and braced for whatever impact was coming.

Luckily all that happened was I chopped off the PVC top to our septic tank and, after skidding on two wheels for a bit, hit a wooden support beam to the deck, and came to a halt. Nearly had a heart attack though.

The ability to replay a game, let's say Baldur's Gate 2, and discover entire new areas, character, items and dialogue is part of what made the game so special just as today with Witcher 2, the knowledge that the game is willing to change, to shift, cut, and alter content to suit my playstyle is what keeps me so intrigued.

I like knowing I'm not seeing everything. I like knowing there's more out there to explore, other things to see.

Point being I really hope that this is a step towards that sort of design from Bioware once again. Mass Effect 2 and 3 were good games, great even, but they were not really 'rpg' in the sense of something like Dragon Age: Origins was meant to be. And then when DA2 took the DA formula and made it more and more similar to Bioware's Mass Effect franchise in terms of design it really bothered me.","1377993674"

I need someone to take one of the open source video players for android (the one it comes with is fine, but if you prefer a different one then that is fine too) and add a few features.

I need it too automatically go fullscreen when you play a video file with it.

Upon playing a video I need it to build a playlist in alphabetical order based off the files in a few selected folders and loop said playlist.

I also need it to scan the few selected folders for updates about every hour or so and update the playlist of videos that it is playing to match the content of said folders, and to insert the videos into the playlist in alphabetical order (ie if i have videos 1 3 5 and 7, then the scan finds a file called 6 it inserts that video file into the playlist between 5 and 7 and plays it after 5 the next time the list goes around)

Thats basically it. Let me know if you can do it and how much you would charge. PM me with your email and quote if you're interested. Thanks","1377993678"

Our roster will include 1 Quarterback, 3 Wide Receivers, 2 Running Backs, and 1 Tight End with a choice of 1 Defense. You will be allowed 6 players on your Bench in case of bye weeks or injuries. The only restriction this league will have concerning free agents is a pick-up limit of 20 per season. The scoring for this league will be standard. Our draft time is at 7:00pm EST on Sunday, tomorrow, so if you are really interested let me know as soon as possible.  As far as the entry fee, we can clear that up through PayPal, as the winnings at the end of the season will be distributed through PayPal.  If you are concerning about a potential scam or anything, then I would be more than happy to draw up a small contract affirming the parameters of the league.

"microgrowery","t5_2s5jo","its true because of [transpiration.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpiration)

a plant regulates it internal temp by opening and closing its stoma or little windows in the bottom of the leaves. when RH% is low and temps are up (typical grow room), the stomata opens up and lets out moisture to cool itself as fast as it can. so there is a constant flow coming out of the ""windows"" and this is the problem as the plant also uses the stoma to intake co2. this is why plants seem to go into hibernation when the temps get sky high... the plants can't breath effectively and are wheezing like a 30 year cig smoker running up a flight of 3 stairs.

70% RH and 70*F is your targets for flowering. (lower temps allow full terpene production.)

- Get a scout car solely for the purpose of running around and making his scripts pay.

Companies that are on top for a certain period of time are then outcompeted and see their market share dwindle in a short amount of time.

Except when there is.

&gt;We, then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach people to confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and also perfect in manhood; truly God and truly man, of a reasonable [rational] soul and body; consubstantial [co-essential] with the Father according to the Godhead, and consubstantial with us according to the Manhood; in all things like unto us, without sin; begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead, and in these latter days, for us and for our salvation, born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, according to the Manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; (ἐν δύο φύσεσιν ἀσυγχύτως, ἀτρέπτως, ἀδιαιρέτως, ἀχωρίστως – in duabus naturis inconfuse, immutabiliter, indivise, inseparabiliter) the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved, **and concurring in one Person (prosopon) and one Subsistence (hypostasis), not parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten God (μονογενῆ Θεόν), the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ**; as the prophets from the beginning [have declared] concerning Him, and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself has taught us, and the Creed of the holy Fathers has handed down to us.

- Council of Chalcedon, from wikipedia

And again, from the CCC 470:

&gt;Because ""human nature was assumed, not absorbed"",97 in the mysterious union of the Incarnation, the Church was led over the course of centuries to confess the full reality of Christ's human soul, with its operations of intellect and will, and of his human body. In parallel fashion, she had to recall on each occasion that **Christ's human nature belongs, as his own, to the divine person of the Son of God, who assumed it.** Everything that Christ is and does in this nature derives from ""one of the Trinity"".

So, I say again, if you are saying that Christ is a human person then you are either using ""person"" differently or you are wrong.","1377993698"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I don't know much about Star Trek, but I watched Abram's take and it wasn't anything amazing. Serviceable sure, but forgettable, and certainly not a classic.

The Star Wars films on the other hand certainly are, and the feeling of whimsy and excitement in the franchise is something Abrams has never delivered. I mean that, I've watched a fair bit of Lost, I watched Super 8, I watched his Star Trek films, none of them have any of the classic and unforgettable elements of the Star Wars films.

When you think of Star Wars, there's no shortage of iconic scenes which come to mind; The Cantina, Jabba's Layer, The Sarlacc Pitt, Luke's fight with Vader in Episode V, they're all great moments which are unparalleled in any of Abram's work. People like to hate The Phantom Menace, but I'll be damned if anything Abrams has done was as memorable as the podracing scene or the underwater sequence.

It used to be films like Star Wars had to be inventive and thrilling to be deemed entertaining. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, these are films that delivered novel and worthwhile experiences, but now we're stuck with Directors like Joss Whedon and J.J. Abrams who are praised for creating consistently dull films, which I can assure you will not stand the test of time.

At any rate, meaningless, repetitive action, regardless of whether it's set in an ""authentic recreation"" of the Star Wars universe, is not what the franchise needs. What the franchise needs is somebody who has the vision and the talent to invent entirely new settings, races, characters and concepts which fit comfortably into the Star Wars universe, while simultaneously creating an experience or a journey which can consistently deliver innovative and exciting moments.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I agree with some of what you're saying. I think where we get off track in our opinions and understanding of this term ""patriarchy"" is this statement you make:

&gt;patriarchy is when men, all men, have power. What we have now is not that, but closer to an oligarchy. Ruled by the few. The few have power.

It's certainly true that not all men have power. Oprah clearly has more power and influence and wealth than your average homeless man. However, men make more than women, are CEOs of the VAST majority of Fortune 500 countries.  Men hold the majority of legislative and political seats. 

I think the term patriarchy, as I and other feminists understand and use it, is a bit different from the historical use of the term (let's try not to get too hung up on this, because I hear this used to discredit everything described as patriarchy because it's 'not real'). Consider instead that it is a set of ideas, norms, and systems in place that promote the success of men over women.

Does it fail to do that? ABSOLUTELY. Your points about homeless men, suicides, and graduate rates are accurate. A lot of this stems from the idea that men must be providers, must be strong, independent, proud, and cannot show weakness or timidness. Women, however, are supposed to rely on men. If a woman is poor or unhealthy, she is expected to find a man to take care of her. Women who do manage to make it into the workplace are bad mothers if they stay. Women who act on their own and do as they please are blamed when others take advantage of them through criminal acts.

Now, although this seems like a stupid idea at first, second, and thirty ninth glance, look at it once more. Give it that fortieth view. Because it's brilliant. Let's have stickers on the front of all books! Slap one on the front of the Bible saying ""Of course this could all be bullsh*t. Maybe he never died! Perhaps he opened a donkey sanctuary. He had a clear bond with donkeys."" Or slap one on the Theory of Gravity! ""Look, thats just one man's opinion. Maybe we could all fly! R. Kelly believed it so. Why would he lie to us?

"TalesFromYourServer","t5_2v480","I can only think of one, Sam. I worked at this restaurant for 5 years, at one point I was out for a couple months since I had a kid. She was hired while I was gone. Everybody thought we would butt heads but in all honesty it was fine at first.

 Now, at this restaurant I was not only a server but I covered host and bartender when needed and was a certified trainer. It was my job to train and also to correct people if something was wrong. I tried to do this in a pleasant way. After a while every time I said something to her she would mock me. I also was not the only one to have problems with her, she had quite the attitude. She yelled at a coworker, cursing in the dining room, with customers around. She also yelled at one of the managers. 

This restaurant had a high turn over rate for managers. I think I had about 20 in the 5 years I was there. Usually had about 4 at a time. So, we had our GM, the kitchen manager(who she fought with), and 2 new managers at the time of this story. I had gone the the GM quite a few times about my problems with her and every time got told 'next time something  will be done.' 

So, onto the actual story. It was a lunch shift, I was bartending and we had her and another server on. Bartenders took tables during the day, usually in the area around the bar. A table of regulars comes in and sits in the back. She said the other server was going to take it. He usually did because they were good tippers. I was there to make money and I'm sorry but if they didn't request you and it's not your turn in rotation, it's not happening. So I got in an argument with her and told her if she didn't want them I was taking them. She told me I was the bartender and it wasn't in my section.  (At this point I very much had an attitude after dealing with her shit for far too long) I asked if she was the manager. She said I acted like one, no, I act like a trainer, I've been here for 5 years. She told me I wasn't doing anything with my life since I'd been at the same job for so long. I lost it. This comment brought me to tears. I went back to the manager, one of the new ones who didn't know of the whole situation, and (in tears) informed him I couldn't finish my shift with her there. He told me that was fine. I headed back to the bar to start cleaning up so I could leave. Manager told me not to worry about it and just go. I called my GM to explain what happened but he didn't answer. By the time I went back to the restaurant to talk to him the new manager had informed him I had walked out. I lost my job. I still want to punch her in the face.","1377993711"
"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","My wife did a very similar degree at a London university and found it was not taken seriously in the jobs market so now does something completely different. 

I studied PPE at the same uni, but because I had a fair bit of tech experience beneath my belt, and I became the head tech of the student venues to fund myself through my degree, the experience made it easy for me to begin my career in live audio once I'd graduated.

That's not to say the degree doesn't have value; Some of the techs studying that degree, under my instruction in the university venues, have gone on to forge superb careers, mostly in the live sound or corporate A/V industries. But that just furthers my point - they had proven experience in a workplace rather than just a piece of paper, although undoubtedly the fact they were studying audio systems whilst they were working was of benefit to them. The fact I was the person giving them direction in a working environment was a big benefit to myself when seeking a career. Some of them were fucking idiots who I had to get sacked, but others became good friends and I brought two of them with me when I landed a team in corporate A/V. Another one went on to found a very successful PA hire company, and I am envious of just how hard he's worked and just how much of a success he has made of himself; he's got about £4m of inventory now and is one of the go-to people in the England south east for dance music events (mostly Funktion-1 rigs).","1377993711"

I'm being picky but just saying this: you could even state that you believe that they *should* have this legal right. For example, I have legal free speech rights, including the right to say some pretty stupid things. That doesn't mean anyone who agrees with free speech has to refrain from criticizing me. I can have the right to say something stupid but you still have the right tell me to stop.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","I smell a Panthers fan. PS you're spot on. But lemme add something. Panthers make the superbowl and end up playing none other than...the Patriots. Graham Gano tears his acl and we need a kicker. In desperation we call kickalicious, but wait...on the other end of the line is John Kasay. He says i'll be your kicker. Without warming up he boots the opening kickoff of Superbowl XLVIII...IN BOUNDS! It's a neck and neck game with the Patriots scoring and getting the two point conversion to tie the game at 29. Stephen Gostkowski lines up for the kickoff, which...lands in bounds! BUT WAIT, John Kasay sets up the return! He warms up left and then breaks right, dodging two defenders. A hole opens; Kasay sprints up the sideline. Deion Branch, who the patriots cut and sign a record 7 different times over the course of the season, lines up for the tackle. BUT WAIT, Greg Hardy and the rest of Monster Inc. ran our kick return formation. They all pounce on Branch and eat his flesh till nothing remains except a few rusty superbowl rings. Bill Belichick sees it as a necessary sacrifice. Kasay now has just one man to beat. IT'S GOSTKOWSKI! Time slows to a stop as the entire stadium bleeds in anticipation. Kasay cuts inside and tries back for the sideline, but alas it's hopeless. Gostkowski has a firm grasp on Kasay's legs and as he is bringing him down he pulls down Kasay's sock revealing...wha...what the...Kasay's left leg is black. IT TURNS OUT KASAY AND STEPHEN DAVIS SWITCHED LEFT LEGS! A surge of power rushes through Kasay's, or should I say Stephen Davis' hamstring and he crushes Gostkowski's facemask. As the clock hits zero Kasay crosses the goal line and the Panthers win! The Carolinas rejoice as the confetti rains down. Skip Bayless gets fired from espn the day after for still shitting on Cam's throwing ability. He is then exiled to the place only known as NBC sports where he must listen to Michelle Beadle talk nonsense about God knows what. Gostkowski ends up getting a machine tied to his face, which results in him creating the true origin story for Bane. He attempts to overthrow Boston but ends up getting defeated by Doug Flutie.

*Først av alt, navnet ""Skapkonservativ"":  nei, det er ikke slik at ""det politisk korrekte meningsdiktaturet"" det stadig snakkes om i kommentarfelt på nettaviser og lignende gjør at jeg ikke føler det er sosialt akseptert å være (kultur)konservativ. Tilnærmet alle i min omgangskrets er enten venstreorienterte eller liberale, uten at det stopper meg fra å si mer eller mindre nøyaktig hva jeg mener når temaet politikk kommer opp. Det er snarere det at jeg vil unngå merkelapper som ""nasjonalist"", ""konservativ"" eller i det hele tatt ""høyreorientert"", fordi jeg føler dette er begreper det har blitt ganske så pinlig å assosieres med i dagens Norge.

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","A year ago i was in a pretty similar situation. Set myself a limit: 2 pints if i have work in evening and the next morning. 3 pints if i have the evening off, but work in the next morning. drink what i want if i dont have work the next day. It was fairly easy to maintain this; i finish work at about 11pm, and the store  is 30min round trip away. 

However, predictably, these beers became less satisfying. The last one was always.. ah shit.. no more beers after. I started to chain smoke 3 cigs in a row after the last beer. 
Plus drinking everyday does take its toll, my colleagues thought i was drinking way more that 2-3 pints a night. 

It was at this stage i quit (10 days ago). I still had quite a lot of control over what i drank, and managed to stick to it reasonably well. But yet it was only going one way: to enjoy it less and less, or drink more and more

I was worried what I said would come off as a bit mean hearted but I just wanted to treat you as I would anyone else who I decided to take time for. 

Like I said your art is very good. Though I feel it appeals to a smaller sub group of people, it can still probably sell but it's going to be difficult. That's why I hinted towards making a picture book of sorts. I'm sure a lot of things run through your mind and you can actually pull those things out and put them on paper and you might be able to hit that niche group of people with creating a set of stories. Perhaps even look into doing a web comic and have a subscription? It all depends on if you like the idea or not. 

I understand the desire to have someone there who you can smile with, spend time with, cuddle with, and hold on your bad days. When you look online you are setting up for a long distance relationship unless you are near the person and LDR's are -very- difficult especially if you feel you rely on another for your happiness. I speak from 2 years experience now and I still have 3 more to go before I may even have the chance to be with my friend / partner / whatever our relationship is considered. It's so hard to love yourself when you deal with any kind of anxiety or depression but it may be worth looking for ways to begin trying to love yourself. You said you're getting stable and I'm very proud of you for that because I know how damn hard it is. The thing is, it's going to be really hard to find a guy to make you feel better and more confident because usually we as people need to do that for ourselves. I understand 100% how much easier it would be to have someone next to you pushing you and backing you each step of the way but a lot of the times that itself puts a strain on the relationship. 

Have you thought about find a counselor or therapist who may be able to help you work with your social anxiety? I mention this because I have been in counseling for the past year now and although it's a slow process I am slowly working my way out of my social anxiety with the help of meds and advice from my counselor(s.) I will actually be attending a LGBTQ group this Tuesday because of my counselors suggestion and it will be the first time I've been out on my own, by myself, in an uncomfortable situation in 5 years now. 

I do wish you the best of luck and hopefully you will live a long and happy life~

For anyone looking for a simple way of dealing with it; Look them in the eye and say 'no' while shaking your head in the negative, then offer whatever platitude you like and move on. Don't look away or down... This is a sign of pliability and usually an invitation to press you more on the matter.

In all my years of experience, there's one thing you shouldn't do; and that's pretend like they're not there. They *hate* being treated like they're not there. And rightfully so, in my opinion.

Eye-contact, be firm but not aggressive, offer your reason (whatever it is) and move on. Takes about a second or two.

If humanity lives one for a few centuries our abilities will be beyond our comprehension from now.
However the last point you raise I find very good, if we would have some some sort of plan for the super human and we would make everyone like that, that would be kind of weird. We would have to replace biodiversity with even more genetic progress, those might be some very strange consequences. But who needs biodiversity when we are this far advanced anyway, and no more individuality... that would change the world very drastic, but because of external influences it's not like everybody would be the same, just very similar.

"LeagueofLegendsMeta","t5_2smhl","I tried for a while to make it work, but she has a few things working against her.

- She's an assassin/carry. She wants a lot of gold for expensive items to do her job. So even before the game starts, she's relying on snowballing from early kills. This makes her unreliable compared to the more common support/tank junglers who can thrive with just SOTAG/+5 boots. It also means that by nature, she has less CC than champions designed to be tanky initiators.  
- Her mana costs are from back in the day when mana mattered. 55 mana for every Q? *90* mana just for a haste, 80 for every wall charge? The fuck is that. Compare that to someone like Xin's 30/40/60 on QWE, or Voli's 40/35/80, not to mention all the manaless champs out there. So once your blue fades, your clearing speed plummets, and it was already slow.  
- Her clears are weak. No sustain, mana-intensive, and generally slow to clear camps. Slow clears means that an enemy jungler with *fast* clears gets more face-time in lanes, so you'd better hope your team can handle that.

In her favour, Poppy's ganks are decent. She has a haste and a dash. Potentially a stun if you line it up right, which almost guarantees a kill. She has a *lot* of damage. And her ult is great for tower dives.

Her main strength is her late-game scaling. The issue is getting there.

I didn't settle on any runes or masteries. Marks can be AS or AD: AS is always good for more machete procs, but AD works with Q's AA reset. Quints can be AD, MS, AP, maybe even lifesteal. For masteries you can run deep in Offense for the arpen/mpen and AD/AP, Defense for the general tankiness which works with your passive and helps your weak clears, or Utility for the MS, mana, and lifesteal/spellvamp. A combination of the three, like 9/9/12, is also a possibility.

Build-wise I definitely prefer Spirit Stone over Madred's, since you want that mana regen. SOTEL is decent, or you can leave Spirit Stone un-upgraded and skip to your Bilgewater and Sheen. +5 boots help a lot with her ganks, as you want to be able to line up wall-stuns. Pick up an early sapphire crystal if possible, as that + Spirit Stone will really help your mana issues. The issue then is grabbing some early kills to get your Bilgewater and Sheen ASAP, and finance big-ticket items like BOTRK/Gunblade. You'll notice a big shift in how heavily you affect fights once you finish your first big item.","1377993726"

One day, the boss was out of town, and I was thirsty. I placed a Vitamin Water on its side in the middle, top-most cubby. Walk away, walk back, and find that I hadn't closed it tightly...and its contents had cascaded down the unit into the particular cubby that my manger was using to store his cell phone.

**Well, I'm fucked.**

My manager noticed this the same time I did, and, noticeably, his stomach dropped just as intensely as mine had. We run next door to buy rice to dry it out, but to no avail. A normally easygoing guy, he caught me off guard when he made his ultimatum: buy him a new phone, or get fired.

**Well, I'm fucked.**

We leave work right then and there (in hindsight, probably a bad idea) for Walmart (open 24 hrs) to buy him a new phone. *Oh wait, did I say new phone? I meant to say new smartphone.* We arrive and anxiously speedwalk to the back of the store. Explain our situation to the man behind the counter, and he laughs at me. *That little shithead.* We browse the phones for a good half hour, that uniformed asshole snickering at us the entire time. Finally, we find one we like.

It's $400.

Working a minimum wage job, I only have $300 on me, so I pay every dollar I have, and am forced to make my phoneless manager loan me $100 to pay for a replacement phone to the smartphone my Vitamin Water destroyed... Much to that fucking clerk's amusement.

But I guess it would be tempting to try for 1500/day before I get too old and creaky, then I could go on Reddit and make a fuss.. ","1377993752"

He's also brought the show down to a more ""respectable"" level in my opinion. During the pre-lefty era, it was a no holds barred podcast but he often shoots things down before they get out of hand. It's not really something I agree with, I preferred it when it was more open and not as censored as it is now.

Don't get me wrong, there's a few good jokes he makes, but as a whole I just feel that the show would be better off without him. Again, nothing against the guy, it's just my opinion. Maybe if he loosened up a bit more I might take to him better.","1377993752"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was attacked one night while waiting for a train and left for dead on the track two yards below.  Someone found me, pulled me out and called 911 less than five minutes before the next train came.

My host family and program director blamed me for what happened.  Even in the hospital, it was shoved down my throat that it was somehow my fault, that I deserved it.  I had lost my front teeth and a large portion of my jaw as a result of the fall to the track, and the complete lack of support destroyed whatever strength I had left.

Because I felt that I had somehow ""deserved"" what happened to me, I never sought counseling and just pretended to be over it.  About 6 months later I developed a severe eating disorder and dropped to a dangerous weight.  I felt that I should have died as a result of my attack, and starvation was my passive way to finish the job.  

When I realized what was happening, I finally reached out to my real mother, who was the first person to tell me that it wasn't my fault.  I got help for the eating disorder, recovered, and continued treatment for PTSD.



Answer to the question : I tried to kill myself by starvation as a way to ""finish the job"" of my attacker, finally asked for help once I was down to 100 lbs and realized what was happening, then got the help I needed in the beginning.","1377993752"

If the police are called to an accident, the office will establish the facts, and determine who was at fault. This will be documented in the police report. The insurance companies will use the official report to find out who owes money.

In many larger Texas cities the police may not get involved in minor traffic accidents unless certain conditions are true. Air bag deployed, somebody was injured, drunk driver, hit and run, somebody refuses to show insurance or drivers license, and many other legitimate reasons. The police cannot resolve minor fender benders, and don't even try.... They will ask that you move out of the road as to not cause traffic congestion, and resolve the incident.

"Recordings","t5_2w8vd","Hey again! So a quick—well, quick *for me*—reply before I grab a nap before the [livestream respawn](http://www.reddit.com/r/Recordings/comments/1lhi0q/live_streamaugust_31st_2013/)...

1. I've said this before, but yeah, frequently /r/ImplausibleSubredditName indeed yields an *actual* subreddit. One of my favorite examples (though it's super low-traffic) is /r/awwgonewild.

2. ""Red-and-blue Tuinals, lipstick red Seconals..."" Oh, and obligatory: [HOLY SHIT THAT MOVIE IS *FOURTEEN* YEARS OLD!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/releaseinfo) In some cultures, that's [old enough to be considered a *man!*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_Bat_Mitzvah)

3. Well, you might start with an advantage in at least one swing state, so that could attract some Super PAC money. And I get that numbness feels preferable to pain, especially in the short-term. But long-term, numbness becomes its own *kind* of pain. 

4. Hell, after rereading my own comment, I'm not sure *I* can decipher it. Let me know what your therapist thinks it means, and maybe we can proceed from there.

5. He's also a redditor! *Three* AMAs via /u/iamlouisck/submitted. The first one goes back to December 2011.

6. What struck me was how your inner monologue just kept going and going in ways that clearly weren't helping you. At that point, irrespective of *what* it's telling you, its incessant nature is likely going to be an issue.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Just because you're making the decision between two different potentially bad outcomes doesn't mean that there is no decision at all. There are many cases where this happens in LoL, they just usually aren't as obvious; like choosing between giving up a kill, or suiciding. Obviously both outcomes are bad, but there are times when those are your only two options, and you go with suicide. Of course you could have just not gotten into that situation in the first place; just like you could have not gotten hit by the bola, but it's too late for that, so pick your poison.

This does give counterplay there's just no get out of jail free card attached to it. It's up to the player to decide between getting slowed more, or sticking closer to one whole teammate who he was already close to. Some cases one is going to be the best choice, and other cases the other will. It's up to the player to decide which is worse for the particular scenario, and act accordingly. How is that not counterplay? 

Does it fit Riot's philosophy of ""everything has to be 100% intuitive, and accessible for absolutely everyone who will play our game? No. Is it a completely bad idea that is inherently bad game design? No. 

Again going back to Veigar's stun that completely fits your description of bad game design because you're choosing to stay in the center giving up any chance of proper positioning, or leaving the circle and being stunned. Neither is a good scenario, but I've never seen people call it poorly designed. Sometimes it's better to flash and eat the stun; sometimes it's better to sit tight and hope you can fight it out. 

What about Zilean's ult? Do you finish off the 1 hp carry allowing his ult to heal them back to full, or do you leave them alive to beat on you mercilessly for 7 seconds? How about Galio's ult? As a carry who's outside the AoE do you choose to attack him while he's ulting to try and kill him meaning he does more damage with his ult to your team, or do you do ignore him? Should Thornmail be removed because it makes you make the conscious decision that you're going to hurt yourself killing the person who built it?","1377993769"

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I'll help with what I can from what I've learned in basic pharmacology courses, but I apologize for the lack of citations. 

All drugs are absorbed in varying quantities depending on the pH (acidity) of whatever it's in. Adderall is absorbed in the intestine (I know IR is, would assume the same for Xr) and varying the pH of whatever solution it is in will change how much of it is absorbed into your blood stream. 

Vitamin C makes solutions more acidic (lower pH) and Adderall has a very high pKa, meaning it prefers basic solutions for better absorption. So when you have juice high in vitamin C it lowers the pH of your digestive tract (mainly stomach and possibly the intestine) **lowering the absorption of adderall**. You should be fine to drink juice or things of the sort after your adderall has been taken and absorbed into your blood. 

That being said, you could also use this knowledge of adderall's preferences to your advantage. Antacids such as tums will raise your pH, thereby increasing absorption of adderall. You might experiment with juice and antacids to find a balance if it's worth the effort to you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was about 15 or 16, I was riding bikes with friends around town and we found this culdesac (sp?) that had a path traveling behind it, down a hill.  It was a paved path, at least most of it (though from where we were, it looked like all of it) so we figured it wouldn't be anything special if it was designed for people to be on it.

Well...turns out this really winding path was a lot steeper than we realized.  It wasn't really wide enough for all of us to go at the same time, so we were all going to go down one after another and I ended up being first.

So I'm going down the path and didn't realize how much speed I picked up, or how quickly until I looked down at the little speedometer I had.  Apparently I was going upwards of 45-50 mph, on a bicycle.  With no helmet, or pads, or anything.

Fortunately, the curves weren't too sharp so I was able to make them while slowly pumping the breaks, trying to slow down gradually, all while scared shitless knowing a single slip up and crash would probably kill me.

...Then that's when I found out that part of the path wasn't paved.  There was a short section on a long straight stretch where the pavement ended, and it turned to gravel, before going back to pavement.  I thought for sure I was going to hit that gravel, lose control, and die.  I'd never been so certain I was about to die before or since.

But as luck would have it, my being unable to slow down enough in time was actually a good thing, because I hit that gravel so fast I just plowed through it, and it in turn slowed me down so I was only going about 20 by I reach the end, enough to finally slow down and stop on the pavement at the other side, then fall over because all my joints were locked up, muscles tense, and so forth from the involuntary clenching I'd been doing the entire time.

And that's why I always wear a helmet now.","1377993781"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Some time ago i was in a small boat, coming back from some island, when i noted that the boat was going towards a wave breaker, man, when i realized that our boat was going to crash into an unavoidable pile of rocks, that was a hell of a fucked moment, since our boat hit the rocks laterally and the waves were pushing the boat, causing it to tremble, i was calm, but i feared that if a big wave came, the boat would have turned upwards, sandwiching us between the rocks and the boat. Good thing the boat got into a fixed position between the rocks for a moment and we could jump on the rocks leaving the boat behind.

Tl;dr Almost died in a boat accident because our driver was hooking up some hoes.","1377993781"

"news","t5_2qh3l","Chemical and biological weapons can easily wipe out cities with relatively small amounts of material. They really are wmds, but can be scaled down in size easily. Recall that this recent incident killed more than 300, and up to 1400, civilians. It has been ages since an intentionally used rocket or bomb has killed so many people.

The US is simply giving the chemical weapons ban some teeth. They don't want it to slide because selective enforcement increases the likelihood it gets used. Here's a conflict that doesn't involve the US, already had &gt;100k casualties, and has been on-going for multiple years... and now the US is going to sink $100Ms worth of munitions to decimate military installations just because chemical weapons were used once and contributed maybe 1% of all on-going civil war casualties... Now other people with chemical weapons ability will think twice before they use it. Maybe you can get away with violently quashing a resistance movement, but use of chemical weapons will be penalized severely.

All things considered, I feel like a response needs to be made, even if it wasn't Assad. It will only discourage chemical weapons use in the future because other unstable governments may rid their supplies to avoid a false flag attack being used against them. Further, it is not like anyone gives a fuck about Assad or the rebels, and this response won't tip the balance of power either way.","1377993783"

Even with point #1, it wasn't long ago that Blizzard mocked their players for being concerned with it being too bright in Diablo 3 by making a pony level, they said that there were certain portions of the game which were actually dark, and that was enough... and now here comes the expansion pack, with *everything* being much darker.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Yes I have my own insecurities we all certainly do.  I speak out against strong opinions and judgments because they can often be wrong.  People we think we can trust turn out to be the wrong person to trust.  Sometimes you write off somebody because they seem a certain way.  Or because of completely unrelated preconceived conclusions.  I am talking about finding a balance and keeping everything in perspective.  I have personally made the mistakes of judging people incorrectly and it quite frankly hurt.

&gt;Every new action I learn about from that person will sway my opinion again to get closer to the multidimensional complete picture that I build of them.

Isn't that the same as judging somebody based on the body of their actions just worded a lot better.

&gt; And fwiw, I consider people posting nudes on gonewild to be exhibitionist, insecure and in need of reassurance.

I would say most of the post on GW suggest that.  But just not all of them necessarily.  You can be an exhibitionist and not insecure.  Some people wanna show off how great they think they are.  But those post that have titles like  ""Does Reddit like big boobs I think my big boobs are ugly"" or ""My boyfriend broke up with me please tell me that I am pretty"" certainly suggest that they are insecure and need reassurance.  Just like every other human being on the planet.  Although I personally would not seek it in that way.","1377993794"

Again, this is how things work in a mixed economy. In a free market he would have known for a fact that the road was privately owned by someone else and sought contractual use before purchasing the property. 

&gt;But not by himself, his entire neighborhood except for the two houses in the very front are actually claimed by one city that wants to do with his neighborhood what it wishes, including taking more taxes but lowering the value of their houses.

Everything you mentioned here is an issue with the state, not the free market. This is yet again an attempt to assume a mixed economy problem would exist in a free market, when the root of the problem is state violations of property rights.

I was trying to find a better example than this 

http://www.saferacer.com/sparco-cup-nomex-jacket

I'd just point your attention to the collar, the starter jacket mentioned above have a shawl collar, but the raving jackets have a taker banded collar with a strap that goes across to hold it shut over a nomex balaclava. It all confess down to flame protection.

The jacket in question isn't an actual raving jacket, is just styled like one. 

Maybe that was a little helpful?

EDIT: this site has a bunch of vintage reaching jackets, a lot closer than the modern one I pointed out initially, I'd dig through for a color and graphic you like.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree. This would positively make me go ghost white with fear. The dad went from being a father to being the scariest thing on Earth. 

Anyways this is why you usually see victims of child abuse (yeah touchy subject) than go on to abuse their own children because they weren't able to process that what was done to them isn't normal or acceptable. They blamed themselves. They have that inherent love for a parent and so equate it as what fathers do because of love. Since it worked on them it gets ingrained as a solution to deal with their own kids. 

There is never ever a need to threaten kids in this day and age. If you can't sit down your kid and explain how their behavior is unacceptable and take non-violent actions to correct it then you aren't a good parent. Violence and threats are the easy route out as kids have no way of handling that. 

I really hate when people say we are spoiling kids by being ""easy"" on them. We aren't being easy, we are just taking the much more difficult route because its worth it to us to set a positive example where violence is NEVER the answer (except when your life is on the line). People inherently learn from pain such as when they first try to touch fire. They learn right away its a NO NO. However that doesn't mean we should take advantage of that and teach them through psychological or physical pain. 

Your parents are your parents. They are supposed to protect you and teach you. How can anyone feel safe with someone who threatens or god forbid hurts them.

If I had been threatened by my father I would have avoided him like the plague. Forget about asking him any questions about school or life. He would have become the boogeyman and I would walk on glass any time he was around. He's no longer a protector or teacher, he's become a ""monster."" ","1377993806"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I am pro-science.  I am also a professional writer in Hollywood.

The reason that people like Tom Cruise command the money that they command is because people will go to see their movies.

Oblivion was a passable sci-fi movie.  It's worldwide gross is closing in at $300,000,000.  The exact same movie with the exact same special effects but staring James VanDerbeek wouldn't have broken $100,000,000.   Staring a complete unknown, maybe $50,000,000.

The same is true with top professional athletes.

Your ""above average"" actor in Hollywood is someone you've never heard of, appears as the ""other cop"" in the background scenes in that show you don't watch.  He takes home between $30k and $50k a year if he's lucky enough to get an occasional line.

The real ""average"" actor in Hollywood had one speaking role in that horror movie that went straight to DVD.  He makes most of his money teaching swimming lessons.

The same is largely true for scientists.  There are a very few select scientists who are outstandingly successful and are paid accordingly as a reflection of the money they generate - either by producing medicine, or drawing speaking fees, or inventing new vacuum cleaners, etc.

Most scientists are doing ""important"" work, but work which can be done by many other people.  They are grinding out their days.  They aren't making massive discoveries or generating massive attention for their company/university etc.","1377993807"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","We are falling into a critical and logical trap here, treating Brienne as a *person* rather than as a symbolically significant character construct. 

Brienne hasn't spent her life as an object of scorn because she was never alive. When analyzing character traits psychology doesn't describe the ""individual"", but describes the archetype that is present in the author's construction of the narrative. Because the text is medievalised, even cross-dressing reaffirms a patriarchal dominance and a hero's journey based on the masculine archetype that symbolizes man's dominance over nature, and over women. Brienne and Arya are only able to ""break free"" of the typical female roles by becoming men. They succeed in their journeys and trials by enacting traditional masculine traits. Their weaknesses- moments that they are in most danger- are linked to feminine archetypes. Their characters are female, but their traits- the ones that make them successful- are part of a masculine tradition.

The solution is clearly obvious as it's a well established locking and unlocking mechanism that has been used by the human race for thousands of years.

The best inventions may be simple but they are not obvious. Being optimal or ""surprisingly good"" is not enough.

""You cannot examine whether something is obvious based on knowing the solution and deciding it is simple.""

Strange, there are people paid to do just that.

""You can only say something is obvious if, given what is known in the art before the relevant date, a person would come up with that solution.""

Monkeys and typewriters. You can be certain that given enough time somebody would come up with the solution. This is why it must be non-obvious *and* have an inventive step. The slide to lock fails on both counts.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I think comparing Fukushima and Chernobyl creates issues from the get go. 

My reasoning behind saying this is because of the handling of radioactive materials following the events. At Chernobyl, the radioactive material was thrown off the roofs of the plants by human beings before encasing them in concrete, Thus, many people were exposed to highly dangerous radiation immediately following the event at Chernobyl. This would explain the relatively fast loss of life that occured there. 

Fukushima could be seen as a completely seperate incident because it is still a work in progress, with no immediate solution in sight. The containers that are currently holding the spent fuel rods have reportedly leaked some contaminated water into the ocean. I am not certain of this fact, however considering the situation at Fukushima has not yet been solved, there is a possibility of it happening in the future with unknown implications. 

For those of you interested, the Russians that were tasked with the job of throwing the radioactive material off the roofs where deemed ""bio-robots"", here is an informative youtube video about them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zx739LOE8U&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player","1377993823"

In other words: not every branch of astronomy is available at every institution.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","For two main reasons:

1) Because there's only a limited portion of the RF spectrum allocated to public broadcast radio. 540–1610kHz is allocated to AM radio and 87.5–108.0 MHz is allocated to FM radio. As you can see on [this chart](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/us-spectrum-allocation-chart.jpg), most of the rest of it is reserved for, for example, police/fire/ambulance radio traffic, air traffic control, military and civilian navigational aid equipment, etc. In major population centres most FM channels are either in use or so close to a station in an adjacent city on the same frequency that there's significant interference, and since AM channels are more rare (and if I'm not mistaken, slightly cheaper in terms of licensing), stations use them when their main content will be talk radio.

2) Because the frequencies used by AM stations travel farther, and so you can cover a significantly larger area. The signal will degrade with distance, but you're still able to transmit farther than (essentially) line-of-sight as you'd get with FM station frequencies.","1377993826"

I've never had any major problem with our healthcare, except sometimes you have to wait a few months for check-ups so I tend to go to private doctors. This waiting is usually a big problem for older people who sometimes need to do a surgery and have to wait over a year. If you have bad luck, there is a chance of being treated like shit so you'd be better off if you have some strings to pull. The nurses are usually grumpy and do not seem particularly happy with their jobs. Also, private doctors seem to have more experience, show more interest and have generally had better diagnoses.

As /u/SuperStingray said in another thread: ""Too many developers [...] act like more freedom intrinsically makes for a better experience in a game, but it almost always comes at the expense of robust gameplay and often a sense of progression."" [(source)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/1k17vg/what_are_some_examples_of_bad_game_design_you_see/cbknwsn).

That being said, I was disappointed that the article didn't take the time to address some of the *really* interesting questions, like:

* How can low entropy games guide the player towards a planned goal, besides outright forcing her actions (as in the example with Wheatley)?

* *Does* low entropy games imply low replay-value, or does that argument assume that players play for the story only'?


I also don't entirely agree that Skyrim succeeded in creating ""a high entropy game with a good story"", because it attempted to tell stories in the way only fitting for low entropy games. Why not look a some of the ways that *high entropy games* tell stories: through their world, and their references (See Jenkin's: [""game design as narrative archtecture""](http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/games&amp;narrative.html) for a discussion on this)","1377993851"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Just throwing this out there but it sounds like one possible solution is to move. Try searching for things like ""best cities to live in"" or ""top places to live"" and such. Many magazines publish articles like this annually.

As far as rent goes, always be looking for a better deal. Obviously check craigslist. Use sites like Forrent.com and other rental sites not just to find a place where you are now but to check other potential areas for cheap rent.  Be aware that none of these site are going to list *all* properties in an area, only the ones that are contracted with them. There are apartment and property locators in your area. Use them. They usually work on commission so they don't get paid if they don't find you a place to live. If they want an up front payment I'd probably use someone else. Pick up rental magazines at your local grocery store, you probably walk by them every time you enter. Newspapers still exist. Check those too. You probably don't even have to buy one as you can normally read them at the library.

Don't rely only on websites and publications. Keep your eyes open when driving or walking around. **Network**. Let all of your family, friends, and coworkers know you are looking for a place. Ask your bartender, waiter/waitress. Someone knows somebody.

Keep in mind that rent is not the only expense that matters. The physical location of the apartment or property can cost you money. This is something 99% of people never think about but affects you every day. An example is that most of my life I have lived in Texas. It's hot. It's fucking hot. When I rented an apartment I specified to the agents I needed a *downstairs* apartment, in the middle of the building, facing north. Yes, they looked at me like I was crazy. Don't care.

Why? Because if you are downstairs and in the middle you have other apartments above you, behind you, and on each side that insulate your apartment. Sunlight from the east and west doesn't come in your windows so it doesn't heat it up. Any cool wind from the north hits the 1 exposed face of your apartment. I hardly ever had to run the AC in the middle of summer because my neighbors were kind enough to cool my apartment with theirs. Living upstairs, with a flat roof exposed directly to the sun, guarantees you $200 or more *per month* added to your bill. Remember rental properties don't give a shit about energy efficiency. They don' pay those bills.

Apply this mindset to all of your other bills. Cell phone: if you're paying more than $40 a month it's too much. You need to consider prepaid. Groceries? You need to start getting the local paper delivered on weekends so you can clip and use coupons. I know you asked for advice about housing and rent, which this isn't. Except it is. Food money, phone money, and grocery money are *all* rent money and vice versa. Do not think of it in divisional terms. 

Some other things. When I was renting an apartment my lease had expired and I was month to month. I noticed they were offering a leasing special that was about $100 cheaper than my rent so I called the office and asked about their special, they were happy to tell me all about what a great deal it was. Then I told them I already lived there and wanted to get that same deal. Dead silence. She had to ""talk to the manager"". She came back and agreed to it as she knew they couldn't offer that deal to everyone except residents. After that every time my lease was up the apartments would just stick a renewal notice at the same price in my door when the lease expired. They didn't like me much but I didn't care because of the money I saved.

Like other people said find another job or do everything you can to earn more/move up where you are. Remember the easiest way to find a better paying job is to have a job. Look *while* you are employed, not after. Mainly you need to realize you are in a tight spot financially and act accordingly. Be creative. Be disciplined. Network. Find ways to save money every day. Be open to making whatever changes you need to whether they be yourself, your job, your location, whatever. ","1377993853"

I am 17 and living with my mom and brother in a one room apartment, would it really be fair for me to be forced to have a baby I wasn't ready for? Would that be fair to the baby?  I am trans*, would it really be fair to make me go through pregnancy even though I do not identify as the female sex? That would honestly be torture, a reminder of what I will always be stuck as. 

One of my old best friends has a kid and it completely took her life off track, because she was pressured into keeping it. Do you think that's fair? 

I think abortion is all right no matter the situation. Even if it would pose no threat to the mother to have a child. Even if the child has no disabilities. No one should have to have an unwanted child. It is not a black and white issue where ""Abortion is bad because of my feelings rah rah rah!"" You can't possibly know everyone's situation and judge them for making a tough decision, just because of your own personal feelings on the issue. 

And before anyone says, ""no one forced them to have sex!"" Does that really matter? Are you saying everyone should just stop having sex, sex is only for procreation, you should only have sex if you're ready for kids? No, that's not how real life works. At all.

My machine had HDD, case and monitor salvaged from earlier machine... got a new mobo, cpu, ram, and GPU... totally cost was something like 4-500. And that was a couple years ago.

The thing with a pc is that you can reuse parts, you can reuse your software like windows or whatever. You can play all your old games. Hell you can play old console games. You can build it slowly and distribute the cost of components.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was white water rafting in Virginia in a ducky. A ducky is what rental companies use as a tourist kayak. Imagine a neon yellow inflatable kayak that is neigh indestructible. I was in one of these, just me, paddling class III  and VI rapids. Not really tough, but still tough, nonetheless. 

During the entrances to one of the class four rapids, the ""Hydrator,"" I was having a bit of trouble. The water was freezing cold, my jacket was riding up, my arms were pumping, muscles burning, the whole shebang. I paddle as hard as I can, riding the flow from rock to rock. Suddenly, I see it, the Hydrator. It's a giant ass rock as big as two of my duckies across, and about eight feet high. The right side is a sheer drop down into basically a massive undertow, it'll drag you down, and you'll stay there. The left side is the safe side.



I'm coming from the right to the left, the guide is yelling at me to get my ass to the left. My helmets shifted all funny, and I'm getting really close to the Hydrator, dangerously close. I kick my ass in gear, ad I book it for the ""safe"" waterfall route on the left side. Catching a lucky water current, I get halfway to left side of the boulder. I'm gonna make it. The guide is yelling something, I can't tell what, I don't care, I'm in the zone. I'm the bomb, I'm a mothafuckin ducky torpedo. 


I'm screwed.


As I get closer to the guide standing on the rock next to the Hydrator, I begin to hear what he's saying. He's not saying, ""Left!"" like I thought, he's yelling ""Raft!"" Looking behind me, I see what he's talking about. A raft about to squish me and make a Hydrator sandwich. I start backpaddling, but it's too late. I'm done.



I look at the harbinger of my doom. The 10 man rubber raft, it's a red behemoth. The chariot of douchebags about to kill me, look me in the eye, and the one wearing a red helmet in the front close enough for me to touch him, said, ""I'm sorry,"" as the rock sandwich formed.


Everything at that moment fled my mind, I was no longer hungry, tired, sore, wet, scared, or remotely worried. All that was left was this one thought as I was dragged into the water.

""I'm fucked.""

I should have phrase it ""I hope you don't say this in front of your daughters"". What do you think it does to her self esteem? You may not want to deal with that problem, but it is one you will have to deal with. Or you can avoid making it a problem by not saying it. You may not hear it, but your preferring male problems to female problems will lead her to think you prefer male to females in general. 

And as for personal woes, my parents never said this. They treated my brother differently than me, but they also treated my sister differently. And that is why I said every child is different. You can't just take male/ female into account. I was never trying to make this about my feelings. It is just some insight into how hurtful this is.

The actual battle seemed to last no time at all, and it didn't leave any chance for us to see the real aftermath of what happened afterwards. I was also surprised at her request midway through the episode and wasn't really sure what the main point was. Was her mother just working in a bar then? Pretty sad though to think that they were all happy a moment ago and none of the people in the bar knew that she was going to be dead very soon.

**Episode 11** - Probably my favourite episode of the series so far. I especially liked the symbolism in the mecha battle with the three orphans being represented as two together. It seemed to be a happy conclusion anyway, or at least as happy as this is going to get considering the character cast slims down every single episode. It leaves me wondering what the truth behind the enemies really is. I think someone previously mentioned the idea of maybe there being other children who are forced into fighting, and it seems like it could be possible. Then again, perhaps their enemies are just based primarily off the lives and troubles of the person battling against them. It's interesting anyway.

**Episode 12** - This made me kinda sad. She's probably my favourite character (or at least one of) and the scene with her and her parents at the hospital where her Dad said that she's their first child was really sweet. I'm hoping that somehow there is an exception and she doesn't die but I have a feeling this won't end happily. The ending has hooked me in a little more too. I'm really interested to know just what the hell is going on now. Are they moving across worlds or alternate dimensions?

If you had nothing to do with the matter at all and your being let go was simply to make up for the loss (which I suspect is the case), then I really don't know what to say to you.

When people make bad decisions, there are bad consequences. That was one of mayonesa's points earlier. When a company makes bad decisions, then the company has bad consequences. **However**, by laying you and your fellow workers off, they are passing the consequences of *their* bad decision on to *you* the helpless employee.

I don't know the details of the situation, but if your former employer was in a position to make a $7billion deal in the first place then I imagine that they were in no real danger of going out of business as a result of it going badly. You and all your fellows losing your jobs was probably not ""necessary to keep in business"", but merely a way to continue turning significant profits that year.

Why are you not outraged by this? It almost seems like you're okay with the fact that the company was happy to pass the buck on to you. You lost everything, and all they got was a slightly larger number on their ledger.

In all seriousness, please explain why you're still economically conservative after all you've been through. You've been personally victimized by the very practices you're voting to sustain.","1377993879"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","when I was younger, I just went to my mom's (but it was my choice to go). when I moved away and became an ""adult"" I looked at who my insurance accepted. the first time, I just picked a name on the list that had an office close to my house--he was a therapist, but not a psychologist/psychiatrist. I went and he was awful--unleashed on me that I was the craziest person he'd encountered in 30 years.... I started crying and said could I leave, I'd pay him, but he wouldn't let me. THEN, I was scared off for a few years, but things got dark with me again and I knew i HAD to see someone. I looked who my insurance would take, and this time I googled the shit out of each one in their reviews. now I have an amazing psychiatrist I see weekly who helps me in so so many ways.

TL;DR: Used random one who took my insurance (horrifying, called me crazy), Used one with great google reviews who took my insurance

She couldn't understand why...she was very surprised when I told her that they are very well known outside of Montreal too. On that same trip I drove down to Hill Farmstead in Greensboro, Vermont (in the middle of nowhere, through mountains, dirt roads, etc.), and an older guy waiting in line to have his growler filled started talking to us. He said he was a neighbor and that Hill Farmstead made great beer, but he was dumbfounded that people would make the pilgrimage there just for the beer. I remember being parked next to other cars with license plates from all corners of the States and Canada. Then I thought, wow, what a lucky guy. People are driving all the way here from California to fill two growlers of beer, and this guy just walks there every weekend to restock his supply of casual drinking beer. I was so jealous I was red in the face. I managed to fill 3 growlers after driving there from Montreal for 2 hours, and I still think today about how great that beer was :(","1377993881"

Not everyone is responds to point paralyzing right away, we call them non-responders, but they are not immune to the effects, it works sometimes. Make sure you got back up training aside from point paralyzing for non-responders.

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-opf_faulAdM/UDcMkeewktI/AAAAAAAADzA/PHnZJJN2g7E/s400/Karate+Fists+-+Kiku-Ken.JPG


When you are dealing with point paralyzing you don't need to worry about breaking your fingers because you won't be hitting areas that could hurt your fist. 


Personally I love the phoenix eye fist, I don't rely only on it primarily. When dealing with point paralyzing I also use the dragon head fist, leopard fist, piercing palm, sword fingers, and cranes beak. 


The strength of these fists come from congruent learned structure as well as internal power that supports the structure. When the energy doesn't penetrate your opponent (for example: you are not rooted, or the opponent has a iron body better than your strike) the energy bounces back and that is what injures your hand; then energy and blood stagnating within your fist and arm. When the energy penetrates there is now bounce back of energy aside from what is rooted in your feet/legs.

The sand is injected into a corebox that is already heated to 500°F and the cores bake inside, the corebox opens and we pull the cores out.

My variation which could feed me a week of lunches (for under 3 dollars) was 2 boxes mac and cheese, 1 (sometimes 2) cans of tuna, and a bag of frozen peas.
I now make a lot of soups, some in the slow cooker. Slow cookers are awesome because you can get cheaper cuts of meat and they still taste good. Also, beans are great because they are cheap and can be put into a variety of things and are healthy Spaghetti, Stir Fry are also great because you can stretch with the cheaper ""filler"" of rice or pasta. Also, If you have freezer space, look for the ""manager special"" meat. If you know what you are looking for the meat is still good just has to be used (or frozen) that day.","1377993892"

"infertility","t5_2saej","I think your instincts are right here. A reply saying that sounds exciting and that you are rooting for them would be appropriate.

Its both stressful *and* exciting, but in my experience, having people I know care about the biggest thing going on in my life has been helpful.

I think the most important thing to remember for future, is that the worst things well-meaning friends have said to me have been in response to finding out that I'm grieving a loss or a treatment failure. People want to be able to say something that will fix it or provide a solution or a silver lining, when really all I want to hear is that they empathize with me.

Example: I had just learned that I was miscarrying for a fourth time, and unable to cope being home alone, I went to a stay-at-home-mom-friend's house. I cried and she consoled me and said all the things a loving, caring friend says: she's so sorry. She can't imagine. What a terrible loss. However, its hard to just cry with someone, to just be with them in their despair. So she went on with some of the famililar-to-infertility platitudes, including most people's least favorite: ""Have you thought about just adopting?""

The thing is, that time is about grieving. If you wouldn't say to someone at their child's funeral, ""Well, you can always have another,"" or ""At least you know you can get pregnant,"" or ""I know someone who adopted and then BAM got pregnant!"" then don't say it when they are grieving a treatment failure or a miscarriage. Believe me, there's no solution you or anyone else can offer that that couple has not already thought of themselves.

I doubt you even need the help, you seem like a really good friend. Best of luck to your friends!","1377993892"

"Swimming","t5_2r0po","Same issue that I had back when I was swimming everyday. I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder. Thankfully, my then girlfriend's mom was a PT, and could tell what it was. But even now, 4 years later, it hurts a lot when I swim more than 2-3000 yds. 

It was due to the way my hands were entering the water. So doing it wrong time however many hundreds of thousands of strokes had the negative effect. 

I would recommend that the next time you swim, take a sharpie with you, and whenever the pain starts up, take the sharpie and mark where it hurts, as that will help in the diagnosis from the PT. 

A funny thing that happened from it was that my left side is bigger than my right. It's noticeable when my shirt is off, as my shoulder and back muscles are more pronounced on that side.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was growing up we had the most bizarre neighbors.  For as long as I can remember, they have hated us.  But, my dad claims this wasn't always so.  When they first moved in, they were apparently normal.  My dad likes to grow vegetables in our backyard,  and we would usually have way more vegetables than we could eat, and so he would give them to our friends and neighbors.  After a few years, my dad noticed that they were acting kind of cold to us.  Like avoiding eye contact, etc.  Thinking that we might have accidentally done something to offend them, my dad went over to apologize... and then their true craziness was revealed.  They claimed that they he was harassing them or something by constantly offering them vegetables.  (He did it a few times a month.  The nerve of him to offer free home grown vegetables to his neighbors).  They were also very upset that we had an RV parked by the side of our house.  It had been there for years, and was even there before they moved in.  Anyways, this is just the start of the crazy.  After that incident, my dad, trying to respect their wishes, left them alone and no longer offered them our bothersome vegetables.  But they were always trying to provoke my dad and start a fight.  When my dad brought out the trash (and thus made noise) we were trying to wake them up and harass them.... even though it was usually like 8am.  When my dad sprayed insect repellant/etc they claimed we were trying to poison their dog, even though it was well on our side of the fence.  They complained about tons of crap like that and were constantly watching us to make sure we didnt do something, and often would retaliate for our ""harassment"" by spraying our cars with water after we washed them or something.  

Anyways,  they finally moved away a couple years ago, and my parents are relieved to say the least.  Come to think of it, I spent my entire childhood u til I was like 20 with them as our neighbors... and I don't think I ever spoke a word to them.  I can't even remember what they look like (granted, they never yelled at me, they always waited until I wasn't with my parents).

A gold / copper eyeshadow would look great on you, like the ones found in the Naked 2 palette.

Call it arrogance all you want but all I'm doing is being honest.   You can deny it all you want, but if you did what I did in the gym, you'd look better than you do now.  6 days a week =/= 4.  1 hour or whatever you spend =/= 2.  I applaud you on working your ass off, which I'm sure you are, and for reading on SS and everything else, but you could likely be doing things even better and therefore experiencing even more progress than you are now. That's just how it works.  Maybe not to the level I did, but relative to your own progress it'd be greater.  If I went 4 days a week and didn't do the volume I do, I wouldn't have made the progress I did.  A lot of variables matter.   Also, if you're on SS, you won't see the same aesthetic gains as someone doing a BB split.  

The 2lb/week comment was about a specific example of someone saying I did more in a month than they can in 2 years.  I was explaining that all I did was lose fat and gain a little muscle in month 1.  That's why I mentioned 2 lb/week - a healthy amount for anyone to lose and that is possible to lose given the proper deficit.   It was ridiculous for him to act like what I achieved in 1 month just ISN'T possible for him to achieve in a year or two...because it's absolutely false.  Think what you want.  I'm just telling the truth.  

Despite the attitude I seem to have about all this, I applaud anyone who works to make a positive change in their life, including you.  If you go once or twice a week, good for you. I mean it. This shit isn't fucking easy, regardless of how often you go or if you're going 60% vs. 85% vs. 110%.  But it bothers me when people expect amazing progress without putting in the effort, and I think a lot of people in this thread think they're giving it 100% when they could be doing more to help themselves.  Then they refer to insane progress as ""unrealistic"" and ""freakish.""  Yea, genes helped me.  But you have no idea how much I cared about all of this.  It's literally all I thought about.  The only thing that mattered to me.  If you WANT it badly enough, you CAN change your body drastically.  Genetics aren't enough to hold anyone back from gaining muscle and losing fat over a decent period of time (6 months - 1 year).  Starting points will be different sure, but I'm speaking about change relative to that starting point.

2. How do the abilities work exactly? By which I mean is there a skill tree for our characters where we can unlock new and more powerful abilities, both active and passive, as we level up? Or do the abilities work like guns and have their own leveling system?

3. You said that it feels similar to Halo, which is awesome. But the gun mechanics in Halo are a bit different from other shooters, in that many guns can't ADS and you can headshot someone hip-firing with a sniper rifle from a mile away, for example. How does the shooting, specifically, feel in Destiny? Will we be using our sights a lot or will hip fire be good enough for everything other than long range?","1377993923"

It's based on winning and losing games.

They don't release tons of the internal workings of it, but suffice to say it will be loosely based on the ELO algorithm used by Chess leagues.

Basically, you have a numeric rating, and every game the matchmaker determines how good of a matchup it is (i.e. it might think team radiant has a slight edge).  If you win when the matchmaker did not expect you to win, you get a big rating boost, but if the matchmaker expected that you would win, you get a small rating boost.  Similar with losing, if you lost a game you were expected to lose, it's a small rating loss, if you lost a game you were expected to win, you'll take a big rating loss.

For the size of the brackets, [some sites have analyzed the replays](http://dotametrics.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/the-size-of-dotas-skill-brackets-2013-edition/), and determined that 83% of games occur in normal bracket, 13% in high, and 4% in very high.","1377993924"

From mod description: ""This mod allows you to harvest a realistic amount of ingredients, while keeping the balance of Skyrim, and not conflicting with other mods. Every plant and flower (but not ingredients) has been tweaked to yield a realistic amount of ingredients, but with the element of luck. This mod also allows you to gain a surplus of ingredients if you harvest everything in sight, while in Vanilla harvesting everything on sight was a requirement if you wanted to level your Alchemy without visiting shops or training.

Harvest Overhaul also takes the size of the plant into consideration. For example, you can get up to 5 mountain flowers from a single bush, the minimum being 1. You can harvest up to 12 mountain flowers from a cluster of 3 bushes, with the minimum being 3. The yield most of the times is consistent, and generally around, or below half of maximum yield. Receiving 4-8 Mountain flowers is quite common.""

My first pets were budgies I taught one of them to talk, and now I just seem to draw birds to me.

When we were waiting at reception it went absolutely mad up against the bars and it was plainly staring at me. So I have the carrier to my partner and I went over to the cage. Well he started calming down but started talking like a mad man. He must of said everything he had learnt.

Then he kept bending his head in a 'rub me' action, so throwing caution to the wind I stuck my finger in to give him a scratch. He loved it! By this time I had attracted a lot f attention from the workers and they collectively screamed as I put my finger in the cage (greys have a terrible bite) but ofc I wasn't bitten. They were all flabbergasted! Apparently he hadn't taken to anyone in there and had mauled everyone who had tried to touch him.

I wanted nothing more than to take that bird home with me, but we have a cat and we rent, its just not fair to bring another animal into this.

The cost of living there is cheaper and it's easier to find low-priced hostels. Also you won't be in the city you moved to for a woman who moved here for another dude. Finally, Seattle is also just about to enter a five-month streak when we'll be lucky to see the sun twice a month. Portland is sunnier.

I then notice that it's abnormally bright - I open my eyes and see my roommate in my doorway, illuminated by the kitchen light, peering into my dark room. He's standing there for a good minute or two, just...standing there. I'm fucking freaked out, but I don't say anything because that particular SO had some sleeping issues and I didn't want to disturb her if she was already asleep.

The paper focuses mostly on the Western ""ethnographies"" of China from that period and their conceptions of gender, but it touches on how the Jesuits were trying to align themselves with the traditional literary elite by hating on the eunuchs. 

I think there's an angle to the dislike of eunuchs across cultures that's been mostly ignored, but that the ""Jesuits and Eunuchs"" paper touches on -- simple classism. In most situations eunuchs rose to their power and wealth from poverty often simply by being a eunuch, which is very threatening to other social groups. You can see this at work in 18th century Italy, and the Middle East (though those guys were often slaves on top of things), but you can really see it in China.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","This is an excellent question! One that I pondered much during my time at Columbia. You are right, the reason animals are born with inherent knowledge/instinct is neurological or how their brain was developed. Their inherent knowledge was passed to them not in a class their parents taught them but in their parents' genetics that contained within them instructions for developing the brains of their offsprings. That programming in their brain contains instructions on how to defend themselves, spin a cocoon or drink when thirsty. 

As to how that information is first acquired is thus far theorized to be a result of natural selection or the theory of evolution. This is an incredibly deep scientific study at the moment, but you can think of it like the shrimp who were best suited to produce offspring eventually led to their current disposition, sticking a grain of sand in their head when malting. The same could be said of spiders which led to the development of silk producing glands and instinctual behavior to spin webs. 

Most animals purely follow their programming and don't have much room in their brains to acquire new skills like humans or other intelligent animals. You can certainly think of it like the shrimp having a basic operating system they are born with. Humans also have the same basic operating system (think fight or flight and emotions) as do most animals. The thing that is especially fascinating is that Humans and some other animals have additional layers to their brains that allow them an ability to learn new knowledge/skills that they were not original born with. Think playing the piano or developing a business empire. 

Here are some really cool articles that talk about these different brain layers... [Anatomy of the Brain](http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-body/brain-article/)

Also my favorite, Carl Sagan's [The Cosmos: The Persistence of Memory](http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi628097817/) Skip to around 17:30 to learn about how information is stored via genetics. Then he talks about the brain's storage of information as instinctual coding. I think these are still on Netflix, so you wouldn't need to watch the advertisements.

So Assad shows up with the only fat leper in the world.  All the other guys have beautiful dates.  Bashar al-Assad wins the speedboat.  Then he gives it to the leper to get rid of her so he can go after the hottest girl at the party… a Gypsy woman with luminous dark hair and green eyes. 

“Did you see me give that speedboat to that fat leper?”

“That was kind of you.  I thought that you were going to have her cast into a pit and devoured with acid”

“What gave you that idea?”

“You kept saying it.”

“Ha, ha… well you know how guys are.  Hey, Gypsy, how about telling my fortune?”

“You are going to be President.”

- inClass is great for scheduling classes, remembering prof and TA contact info, tracking assignments and tasks, making quick notes, and tracking separate terms.

- DropBox allows you to sync your notes from your note-taking app, and also has a good fileviewer for any downloaded notes.

- GoodReader is a great file-manager for iOS. It can read most files, and is a must for saving any textbooks to your device.

-**Check to see if her school has an app for their file-sharing network. Our school uses Desire2Learn and they have great mobile options for the iPad that are incredibly useful.**

She should also pick up a stylus - I recommend the Adonit Jot stylus - for taking quick notes.

*A lot of people are saying it isn't an option to use the iPad instead of a laptop, but that just isn't true at all, and you can ignore everyone saying that.

There is no special formula to determine the lat/lng of a zipcode. There are companies that build these databases using census data.

Second, if the locations are you finding for your users are static, I would recommend storing these lat/lng in a table because you are going to be comparing each one of these lat/lng to the users zipcode lat/lng and coord look ups are expensive.

"longtail","t5_2y2kz","&gt;He and I have been in a relationship with three years. I can't believe I never saw this before. He acts weird towards his mother. Like, he and I have a son (who's only 2), and I don't know how I'd feel if my son talked to me the way my boyfriend talks to his mom.
&gt;
&gt;* He talks about our relationship. Now, that's not weird, but he goes into detail about everything. I don't know if any of you realize how annoying that is. Imagine your boyfriend's mother knowing everything there is to know about our relationship. Except, he leaves out a lot of the good things. So his mom doesn't really like me that much. But she knows I have a squirting fetish. She knows what porn I watch. I hate that. I fucking hate facing that woman knowing that she knows all of those things about me. He talks to her like she's the one in the relationship with him, and I'm just an outside factor. He involves her in our fights, getting her to talk to me to try to ""calm me down"". IT'S NOT HER BUSINESS! **I've told him that I don't want her involved in our relationship like that!** He continues to do it. I fucking hate it.
&gt;
&gt;* He has sexual fantasies about her. Not just incest fetishes, but it's her. He's told me about how he wants his mom to see his hard dick. **He's acted on this desire.** He'll sleep naked after he's asked her to wake him up the night before. Then he'll make sure his dick is visible. I don't know how many times he's done this, but he talks about it like it's no big deal. He hasn't said he wanted to have sex with her, but why would he tell his girlfriend that he wants to fuck another woman. Especially if it's his mother.
&gt;
&gt;* He HATES his step-father. Now, that's normal for a young boy to not like his step-dad, but it's been ten years and he still hates him. I'm beginning to think that it's jealousy. He never talks to them both as a family, he'll only talk to her, and she'll have to talk to him about things.
&gt;
&gt;* He's okay with having sex at his house while his mom is home. I'm so incredibly uncomfortable with that because his bed squeaks VERY loudly. You can hear it throughout the house. Now, he thinks that's okay because ""she knows we have sex"". But I don't want her to know when! I want some fucking privacy! I don't want to have sex knowing that his mom is listening in, but he's INSISTENT that we have sex while she's there. I'm right to not be comfortable with that, right?
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;**tl;dr**: Boyfriend acts weird with his mother. Talks to her about EVERYTHING, also has sexual fantasies about her. I am grossed out. I wish I weren't, but I am. What do I do? Also, sorry for the caps and swearing. I didn't realize how angry I was until I started writing it all out.","1377993945"

What if I get stuck at a table with a problem and can't get back to the computer to turn the second or third order in? We don't even always know what's going on in the kitchen to make those calculations. Maybe they're running on time with salads but held up at the grill, who knows?

(That is, without grossly invading Syria's sovereignty) And what will that do? It will send a precedent that the US is free to invade the sovereignty of any nation!

So far I've only seen ""chemical weapons"" being used as a means to strike in the same way ""because terrorism"" has been used to justify other wars and questionable US government actions.

I have never id'd a body. I do have some investigative experience - and that adds up to: ""whatever you can find out, however you can, as long as it's legal."" Check the databases (there's a bunch). Check the newspapers. Check with schools, military bases and anything you can find that's remotely connected to what you know about the person. Talk to a bunch of people, get input from other people who have worked similar stuff. Brainstorm. Be creative. Hunt. Which is why this stuff is so addictive.

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","I understand your confusion and have no idea why people think it's appropriate to downvote you in here.  But, 

&gt;It just seems really backwards to me.  I mean they already made a notation for the left and right sides.

If anything, the other way around would be backwards.  Why say lim x-&gt;0+ when that's all there is?  It implies that lim x-&gt;0- is defined.  You really only ever refer to the one-sided limits when you want to highlight that they are different, or specifically show that they aren't.

&gt;Why use the normal notation and be more ambiguous? Even if it's obvious that sqrt(x) cant be negative. 

Except it's not really ambiguous at all.  In all cases it's just defining the ""normal"" limit as being the most general one possible by the function.  What ambiguity are you claiming here?

For a function like sqrt(x) the one-sided limit IS the limit.  The fact that x can't be negative is really important here.  The definition of the limit includes a statement like ""for all x such that 0&lt;|x-a|&lt;delta.""  Implied in this is that we are taking such x from the domain of the function (otherwise it all falls apart, specifically requiring |f(x)-L| to be less than epsilon, since f(x) doesn't exist).

&gt;To me it's like saying

if a and b exists then A = a = b . But if only a exists, then A = a.

Well, it's exactly like that, and I don't see the problem

&gt;Then if someone writes ""A"". The person reading it might be inclined to think that a and b both exist. When in reality the person who wrote it only meant that a exists.

The person who wrote it didn't mean *anything* about the existence of a or b.  They exist or they don't.  It has have nothing to do the limit notation at all.  If the person reading it makes such an assumption, it's their fault, not the fault of the writer or the notation.

Perhaps another example can clarify.  Let f(x)=x be defined only on the rational numbers.  We say lim x-&gt;0 f(x) is 0!  Even though the function is not defined for a whole lot of numbers in between, we can still satisfy the formal definition of the limit as long as we only pull x's from the domain of f.  It's no longer a positive vs negative thing, so the one-sided limits have nothing to do with the domain anymore.  So why would we make an exception for cases where the domain happens to be restricted according to sign?  It would be arbitrary. ","1377993968"

I think the message has transformed to a broader and less intensely faith-based one. They've also done some nice things like allowing women and minorities to attend meetings, which was not always the case. 

The only reason I posted was to illustrate my experience of a) being agnostic, and b) having a positive experience with AA and feeling that it helped me greatly. I can see how it may seem from the outside, but the vast majority of meetings are open for anyone to attend and they are certainly not bible-thumping ""kneel before your Lord"" conversion sessions.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A bit of back story first. My mate had just recently joined the army, he was generally a bit loose so we all thought this was a pretty good thing. Anyway about a month before he leaves he gets this psycho girlfriend. This chick was nuts she would act like a perfect person to his face doting on him and organising drinks/bbqs for him to catch up with his mates before he went away. We all liked her at this point, however one day I was talking to my mate and he starts telling me how she had analysed all his friends (psych student). I was a bit pissed off about this because she hardly knew any of our friendship group and she made some pretty big assumptions about us all. Anyway let that go no biggie. Then I noticed every time I spoke to her she would dig for info on my mate, stuff like ""xyz is pretty fucked (in general) do you think it has something to do with his dad"". I usually just have some half assed response to questions like this ""not sure"" etc. anyway the craziness gets worse while he was away. For starters I would constantly see her out with other guys, I told my mate this and he would just assume they were friends, from what I saw and heard from a mutual friend she was more then friends with a few people. Anyway by this time I know she's a rotten egg, this is made more sure for me when I talk to his mum and she tells me my mate is thinking about coming home because she is being hysterical about not seeing him. We were all pretty pissed off about this because as I said my mate was in a bad way before and was seeing positive change where he was. Anyway this went on for a while while he was in the army. Between her being crazy clingy when he was down, crying and shit at the meet ups we had when he got leave, to seeing other guys when he was away + guilt tripping him when he was over there, me and my mate decided something had to be done. So one night when he was down and we were all pretty smashed me and my mate took him aside after crazo had left and started spilling everything to him. She had been cheating on him, and in my opinion, his mums, brother and all his friends she was a crazy bitch. about 10 mins into this guess who storms into the room! That's right crazy gf herself! Turns out she had not actually left and was standing on the other side of the shed wall, anyway she starts yelling at me and my mate how she had never done anything to us and she   didn't understand all the hate. I was pretty drunk so I let her have it (pretty much repeating what she had over heard anyway). She ended up storming out with my mate. They are still kind of together 3 years later, about a year into it she said she wanted an open relationship because she couldn't handle waiting for him while he as away. She wanted to be his gf when he was on leave and do anything she wanted while he was away. Also asked if he had killed anyone in Afghan in one of the few calls he gave her while he was over there, asked him if he has PTSD also while he was still over there.  ","1377993971"

Then he keeps trying to grapple with this guy that is 30+ pounds bigger than him. Then at the end of the 2nd he has him up against the cage with Soa covering his head, so what does he do? Throw a bunch of shots to the head. All he had to was land one or two shots to Soa's undefended body and he would've dropped. ","1377993972"

With long lock-on times, you can easily counter by using max rank flares and just flying low enough that terrain increases the lock time.

I personally never use the striker because the lock-on takes SO LONG that I would have been better off doing something else in that time, especially when most players will just flare it off and run away before I do any significant damage to them. But I guess there are enough shitty players in PS2 that occasionally getting a kill on an ESF with little effort seems like a worthy pursuit.","1377993972"

That was only once.

There was only one TNG plotline (Descent) with the Borg after BoBW in it that wasn't JUST Hugh by himself.

The Borg were only in six episodes of TNG, and four plotlines. Q Who, BoBW(x2), I Borg and Descent (x2).

They were used sparingly, and thus highly effectively, making them powerful and fearsome villains. Unlike Voyager which coated them liberally like salt in a microwave meal, thus degrading them utterly.","1377993973"

They simply can not get around to the junior rinks and coordinate with all of the scouts (of which the Leafs have many) all year long. There's too many other fish to fry with the pro team.

It is Dave Morrison and his staff that deserves much of the credit.  Morrison was promoted under JFJ to Director of Amateur Scouting, and he was kept in place under Fletcher, Burke and Nonis since.

"parrots","t5_2qhyf","You sound like you're the type of person that might do well with the right parrot. You seem to have everything but the experience. Some of the species you mention (grays, and cockatoos) and be VERY difficult birds to care for. However, I'm not going to be once of those people that recommend you get a ""beginner bird"", because in all likelihood, that beginner species will still live for a good portion of your life, and while you will love them, you may never be truly satisfied. 

What I'll recommend instead, is to find a place nearby that rescues parrots, or a bird store that raises them. Volunteer! Learn from people, who know what they're doing in a controlled environment and get to know several large parrots, and how to care for them. 

Rescues typically have a good mix of birds with different issues, and volunteering will give you the opportunity to learn how to work with said issues in a real life setting. You may decide you like a different species then you originally thought, or find a specific bird that you really click with. Or you may decide that parrots actually aren't your thing, but hey, its all great experience and you'll come out of it respecting them.

Basically what I'm saying, is that if your dream bird is a Grey, go for it, but put in the time working with them so that you know what you're in for. ","1377993979"

She sneaks past him, gets the artifact and just as she's about to successfully leave she gets the bright idea ""Hey, let's grab a strawberry!"".

Here is another thought, maybe they are not planning a serious long term relationship, so maybe the 'maturity' isn't really important -- maybe they just like to fuck each other caus they find each other attractive? Again the question becomes 'what's wrong with that?' If both parts are there voluntarily and above legal age, why should it irk anyone (for the love of all that is holy don't say social convention again) -- as a general rule of thumb -- if you can't explain why something is wrong apart from social convention, then the convention is probably bullshit.

I think the comparison between those two particular shots was an idiotic way to make a point about depth of frame, as the Django shot is clearly intentionally about focusing the shot on one person telling a story in front of a rock wall lit by firelight (which, by the way, is a far more dynamic shot in the actual moving picture format, as opposed to a still taken from the movie), and the Drive shot is more about tension between the two characters, and thus Gosling's back is to the camera, he takes up more of the shot and she seems smaller across from him, etc.

As for OP's point about being drawn into the movie, I feel the characters in these two shots are more useful as a comparison, as Winding's main characters are so abnormally quiet and stoic as to be almost alien, and therefore alienating (see also Only God Forgives, which amplifies the style he applied to Drive until the characters barely exist as characters), and Tarantino's characters, while often also very abnormal, are at least engaging and dynamic.

That's not to say that the sidebar is useless, but most new reddit users will tend to ignore it and go straight to posting their question.

That's my take on it at least. What could be helpful is if somehow it can display on the page before making a post ""READ THE SIDEBAR BEFORE POSTING YOUR QUESTION OR YOU WILL BE BANNED""... or something along those lines.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","Here's the dirty little secret about IT as a whole: there's a sea of shitty people punctuated by a few islands here and there of actual talent.  Mediocrity is the name of the game, by and large.

Point being: even if your worked sucked, which it doesn't, you'd be employable *somewhere*.  No, not at a top firm... and yes, independent contracting work might not go so well for you... but you'd be able to get a job at lots of places and probably be no better or worse than the majority there.

The best advice anyone can give you is this: DON'T SETTLE FOR MEDIOCRITY!  Be your own biggest critic, work harder than everyone around you to improve yourself and never be afraid to put in time off-hours... note that I AM NOT saying to put in a bunch of extra work time... in fact, DO NOT do that... but  DO use your own time to work on side projects that are fun to you but that push your skills.  That alone will, I swear, make you better than probably 75% of all IT workers.  Don't count on your job to hone your skills - that's YOUR responsibility and has to be done (mostly anyway) on YOUR time.

Attention to detail is your friend... be the guy that notices the logo being misaligned by 1 pixel and then be the guy that is obsessed with getting it lined up right.  Make that thinking a basic part of who you are, and again, you'll have a huge leg up on most others.

At least tell me that some region lit up like a christmas tree but her neuro exam was completely normal to have some nominal justification at cracking her skull open.  

My immunology days are long behind me but thinking of it as a diagnostician, the decision to go for Ellie's brain wholesale was incredibly foolish, made even more foolhardy with the information they had on hand even without getting into the morality of sacrificing a human being. 

It killed me when I first finished the game because there's not many in the subreddit to discuss this level of detail as to why the Fireflies had no idea what they were doing. I tried initiating this discussion then and people were right to be suspicious because this is reddit and everyone's an Internet Doctor, but people were adamant that the vaccine was possible simply because the Fireflies were so confident they had the answer when looking at the data presented reveals that was never the case at all.  

I have no idea what ND planned. Like it's clear they had *some* technical help beyond wikipedia to guide their writing but if the ending was truly meant to be a clear choice between a world with a vaccine or a world with Ellie, they failed here, because the Fireflies really had no idea what they were doing.  They either already had what they needed to create a vaccine or they were going to kill the one patient they had if they happened to be wrong. 

Even though it's clear to me that the Fireflies had no chance at creating a vaccine given their demonstrable gaps,  I still find the finale to be amazing.  Joel makes his decision without understanding this and believes that he's making that sacrifice even though I as the player know otherwise. ","1377993998"

(on a side note: i always wondered how celebrities with medically super-enhanced jobs managed to get tops that fit, but then i discovered tailoring. hello dresses! basic tailoring, like on the tunic i'm wearing today, i can even do myself.) 

yes, it's true that functional big-bust bras don't come as prettily designed as the gorgeous ones made for girls with enviously smaller boobs (i hope that came out as me envying their boobs. that's how i meant it. to go braless just *one* day *sighhhh*). however, i just remind myself that at work or otherwise in public, it's about the outside presentation, and i wear the prettier, sexier (yet ill-fitting) things where appropriate (she says very delicately).

 So getting a higher salary makes you more risky? What science went into that?

&gt; About 22 per cent of U.S. companies with the highest-paid CEOs received taxpayer bailouts after the 2008 financial crash.

  First of all, the reinvestment plan was targeted, and CEOs who didn't need a ""bailout"" had to take one... secondly what was the criteria for ""companies with the highest-paid CEOs"". How about some facts?

&gt; Eight per cent of highly paid CEOs were fired for poor performance but received golden parachutes valued, on average, at $48 million US.

  CEOs negotiate their compensation before they start work. This is a well known fact. To make it seem as though they were paid for failing is deceptive.

There are other legal draw7 cards at 4 and 5 mana, so its not going to break storm.  Storm has better options if the best play is to wait a turn and untap lands after dropping the Jar.  If the plan is to break it on the same turn, Ad Nauseam, Past in Flames, and Reforge the Soul are all better if you are ritualing into them.  Don't overvalue the line of drawing a jar off a jar. Drawing another 7 doesn't mean you are winning harder (since storm should be winning already if it has resolved its engine).  No untap clause most likely makes it worse than Timespiral in High Tide.  Current combo lists don't want it.

It's great for control late game in some cases.  Drawing it early is terrible though.  Control almost always wants to wait a turn to break it.  A Turn 6 play that requires tapping out is very slow. The deck construction gets pretty forced too. Stoneforge, Vendillion, counters, discard, and lands are all lackluster draws.  You need things like moat, countertop, Jace, etc to draw while having enough early game contol cards.  I don't see it replacing Jaces and Entreats en masse.  Magus of the Jar sees no play, though being a creature is a mixed bag. Control will almost always want to wait the turn, negating the summoning sickness, and can protect both the Jar and its magus imitation.

MUD gets a boost and probably moves to Welder versions.  Jar is probably one of the stronger threats the deck can use, but if you've let them resolve Welder + accelerant + threat, you're going to have a bad time no matter what they drop.  The deck still has consistency and mulligan issues, though it will recover better from well placed counters and discard.  There are stronger tinker targets in most builds depending on the board state.  (Tinkering a specific one-of threat or problem solver will almost always be better than rolling the dice, even if they are a bit weighted.)

All the old lists for Megrim-Jar relied on Tinker, Mana Vault, Vampiric Tutor, and Yawg's Will.  Transmute Artifact, Enlightened Tutor, Chrome Mox, and Rite of Flame as replacements are all a giant loss of power. I don't think the tuned result would be better than a storm deck.

Like I said originally, I have only read through ADWD once (and the rest of the series only once as well I might add) so maybe you are on to something that escaped me.  As I see it though, I just thought building Winterfell in the snow was really something a bit similar to Arya not being entirely able to commit to being ""no one"" and feeling a need to keep some part of her former life, specifically needle.  Sansa has had a tumultous time since leaving Winterfell and her memories of her life back then are calming and stabilizing.  There is clearly something to the fact that she has felt a type of magnetism toward Godswoods, but it is so subtle that after one reading I can't quite see it as some profound connection to the Old Gods in the same way to which her siblings seem to be subjected.  So I don't know.

The Theory of Evolution is one of the most complete and well tested theories in existence, mainly because of all the scrutiny it gets.

Edit: I keep thinking of more.

While on a hunting trip I was bored and thought it would be fun to walk up to a bees nest and stick an arrow into it. I was not a smart kid. I ran into our parent's camping trailer screaming and taking my clothes off. There was so many of them that they had gotten into my sleeves and collars and were stuck in my clothes stinging and biting. I don't remember the rest of the trip, but it probably wasn't pleasant....

as far as fonts go here is a good website for some pretty solid google/web safe fonts (free) http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Driving up Newport Blvd. on a Sunday evening, road was clear, dark-ish between two traffic lights, cruising at a reasonable speed... until seemingly a woman was directly in front of my car, jay-walking across this three-lane highway. I did what I could to avoid hitting her dead-on -- I swerved hard to the left. This caused my car to begin fish-tailing on the highway until flipping over several times, ending up stopping upside-down, skidding on the roof of the car watching the sparks from the metal scraping along the concrete through the shattered windshield. At the time I had a portable CD player in the car, and I still can pick the exact moment in the song when the music stopped playing. My first thought was, ""I really fucked up this time.""

I never touched the moron woman illegally crossing the highway. She was just in relative shock in a bar across the street. Luckily I was wearing my seat belt, and I only ended up with a scraped up arm and a small cut on my head.

"Music","t5_2qh1u"," I can do this all day.. 

When the 'international band' want to tour Canada, their record company will have to make a few decisions.. Do they want to play auditorium style venues that have a much larger capacity, and charge less or play the bars..

Who buys music? Young people.. Who can't go to bars? Young people...

So the record company has to send two acts to try to put butts in the seats, OR, use a 'happening' local/national artist.. The record companies would rather play the 1000 seaters for half the ticket price. Young fans buy merch/CD's etc. This scenario is MUCH BETTER for the international act.. The problem? Canada has no 'grass roots' music scene... 


Why, oh slinger of mighty insults, is that?


[This](http://www.grassrootsy.com/2012/02/22/an-open-letter-to-venues-that-exploit-their-musicians/) is why... The modern business model is 'short term profits, for ever'.. It's ridiculous, but it's what they do.. So these venues now have a dilemna.. Invest long term in local music (promotion and radio contacts) or your scenario. ""Fuck it we quit"".. 


The bands can start touring doing all ages shows (which is a way better business model for sales). All WITHOUT any additional fees. And if the bars still want to do the occasional headliner from afar they can, the best way to hedge their investment is to make sure that the shit hot local artist that they groomed will fill the house anyways, so at no point do they lose money..

People defend the prices and say its because it takes a lot to constantly research and update, but that is the part I say bullshit. If they wanted to keep the costs down, they could offer ""amendments"" for $5.00 a piece that have the necessary updates from previous versions, instead, they offer whole new books (many written by the professors that make them mandatory) so that nearly each semester, the students have to pay full price in order to have the complete class experience. It shouldn't cost you $650 for mandatory books in order to complete your class. This day in age, the books should be available online for a small fee, if not free. Everyone's making bank - the colleges, the dean, the professors/authors, the book store, the publishers.... except for the students. They are being sucked into debt with shit like this. It's garbage.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","So, because in nearly every experience I've had on Reddit mentioning that I'm Vegan or trying to explain that something is a misconception, etc... I've been downvoted to hell and I feel that its unfair I'm playing victim? 

Let's face it, Reddit loves Bacon...

Maybe I'm the only Vegan who isn't self righteous... But I don't think that is the case, in my experience people come into a conversation with Vegans with a certain negative mindset. Trust me, I've been Vegan for nearly ten years, I have some experience. I don't go around proselytizing... I only speak about it when I hear someone who clearly has been misinformed or when I am asked to. I don't want to convert anyone, I want people to make the choice to go Vegan because they think its the best choice for them, not because someone talked them into it. I used to be a hardcore meat eater, I loved my steak and Bacon and beef jerky and all that stuff and I though Vegans were fucking stupid... and one day that changed. 

I don't think that Vegans are pre-persecuted, but I do think that there is a certain attitude that is always present when it comes to interacting with us... That since ""we"" think we are superior, so you may as well treat us like the  assholes that we are... fucking Vegans and their high horses...

Anyway, I understand that a lot of Vegans are pretentious assholes, but I'm not and neither are a lot of us. I would just like for people not to see I'm pro Vegan and immediately downvote me to hell for it and instead read my post and judge me fairly... Especially when I'm correcting someone who is spouting hateful, misinformed bullshit and knows fuck all about Veganism...

I've discovered that most TBM's, once they discover you don't want to be reconverted or brought back, will abandon you. You're probably going to lose some pretty good friends. Every time you see them they will look at you with some form of disappointment on their face. They can't get over their religion in order to keep someone important to them in their lives. They'll see it as ""keeping themselves clean"" or what have you. 
I have lost some pretty good people from my life because they don't want to be seen with me. Brace yourself for potentially awkward situations, really. I've found one of the best ways to diffuse a situation is as Rogue_Hero says is to say ""It's a personal matter between God and I"" and to leave it at that. Good friends won't bring up the matter anymore. TBM's will pester you until they give up and write you off as evil.
Best of luck, OP. Once you've all aged a bit more and your TBM friends have grown up, I'm sure the situation will improve. ","1377994035"

However, I think it's easier to set an expectation that states can't use chemical weapons. It's much harder to figure out what faction of rebels violated international norms against chemical weapons. Still, if it were possible and rebels did use chemical weapons than I agree with you I wouldn't feel differently.

Separately, I don't agree there are credible reports that say the rebels have used chemical weapons. Only conspiracy theory type sites of disseminated that claim. Furthermore, I don't think your defeatist ""who knows who to believe"" attitude is particularly productive.

Lastly, this is a very specific norm against chemical and nuclear weapons. Unfortunately there is no international body that is capable of enforcing these important rules of international conduct. China does intervene, leaving us as the only other super power. Meanwhile, Russian and China will block any intervention through the United Nations.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","On the point of his step-father, I'm 30 and my dad has been with his lady for over 15 years now. I still HATE her. I hate her to the point that I stopped speaking to her following Mother's Day this year. I likely won't see either of them for Christmas because I can't stand being around her for a whole day. 

She's horribly disrespectful to not only me but also my father. She strung my dad along for years making him make change after change as a per-requisite to marriage only to then tell him that she would not marry him, would not let him move in to her house even after she dies, but also won't let him break up with her and find someone else. She ""makes him"" do her yardwork because he rents and doesn't have to mow his own lawn. He pays for her truck maintenance. While he was off work following a heart attack and surgery where only 2 of his 3 blockages could be cleared, she made him install a new garbage disposal for her because she didn't get to take any time off to do it for herself. 

Like a dope my dad goes along with it, but that is only because his last relationship was not this type of borderline abusive; it was actual abusive. 

The things she does and says to me aren't has heinous because I very strictly limit my contact with her. This summer, my entire life was turned around following both a disabling botched surgery and a second, unrelated, pretty awful diagnosis from a specialist after suffering for several years with a mystery condition. She said I was full of shit and lazy and I'm just looking for an easy out on my student loans. I'm currently working 50 hours a week at what was supposed to be a part time job while I wait for Medicaid approval, and am only out of school this semester because the surgeon severed one of the nerves that controls my quadriceps and I couldn't learn how to walk in time to go back.

So to someone who just walked into my life 3 years ago, my relationship with my step-mother may seem like it's puerile or like I'm some kind of ungrateful brat that can't get over someone else in my dad's life... But these issues and the end of my contact with her is something long standing. We don't speak today because 15 years of shit built up. 

Maybe your man has something hella creepy going on with his mom, but consider his behaviour toward her husband could have more to do with other things. Father/son relationships are very mysterious. Add a non-biological father figure who wasn't around for childhood into the mix, and the mystery goes even deeper. ","1377994037"

The issue at hand is with who is at blame. Not whether or not it happened.

This issue is similar to another situation IMO. Two people live together. One gets a black eye. The one with the black eye says the other hit him/her. The accused says the other did hit themselves in the eye just to get him in trouble with police. Who do you believe? Someone definitely has a black eye, but it isn't like a camera saw the black eye happen.","1377994040"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The point of the article is that the advantage these high speed traders have because of the reduced latency they have. Because they can see that, for example, the price is $24.95 and the price being displayed to the rest of the market is $24.96, they can buy the shares at $24.95 and sell then at $24.96 before the rest of the market can see it has become cheaper. So guess what, my limit order is set for $24.96 and it goes through. The shares I just bought at $24.96 were bought at $24.95 and sold again to me less than a second before by an HFT firm. So I don't really lose anything, since that is the price I wanted to buy at but I still don't think it's right that they have such an unfair advantage and can suck the money out of the market like this. 

I see your point about limit orders but it doesn't solve the problem that we aren't getting the same information as the HFTs and they are making tons of money off of it. ","1377994046"

Nipples - and erogenous zones in general - *are* useful. Nipples have sex appeal, and all erogenous zones play a part in sexual reproduction.

Now, about goosebumps. Trapping air by raising hair is not their only function. Our hair can act as a sensory organ when it brushes up against things near, but not touching, our skin. Raising these hair can increase their sensory response. The piloerector muscles are connected to the sympathetic nervous system. Their stimulation ties back in to the sympathetic nervous system through which it connects to thinks like heart rate and digestion. Also, the contraction of the piloerector muscles helps force out oils onto our skin, which keep the skin moisturized and has antibacterial and such properties.","1377994061"

You can keep giving me random examples, and even if you gave me 1,000,000 it wouldn't prove there is a friendzone. 

You are ignorant to your own relationships and feelings. 

ohh yea, i will bet 1 million dollars you are a good looking white girl.

PS. asking asinine rhetorical questions IS NOT MAKING AN ARGUMENT. ie 

1. would my best female friend be in the friend zone?
2. Have I had feelings for a guy that went nowhere?
3. Does that mean I'm not good as a friend?

all decent points you could of actually made instead of asking a stupid asinine rhetorical question that makes you sound like a know it all bitch who can't be persuaded of shit.","1377994062"
"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I definitely agree with most of your points that things are looking grim without the korean scene being strong.  I still do think it's ""okay"" because the community is still here, MLG did not permanently drop SC2, Dreamhack is still awesome, WCS is improving day-by-day, IEM is still amazing, RedBull is still fun to watch, etc.  There are top koreans that aren't going anywhere (until military service).  Nobody has the magic esports formula because everything is still in its infancy believe it or not.  

Will the scene die off as other 'better' esports provide competition with SC2 and continues to draw away members until there is nothing a year or two from now?  Will SC2 become a shadow of its former self without a pillar of korean talent always being there to put foreigners in their place?  Will there be sponsors to keep the scene alive while viewership levels are decent but not great?  Will SC2 become a niche game?  All big questions of the day but in my opinion just noise.

People saw all of this miles away not because of LoL but because SC2 was living off its predecessor's reputation.  KESPA dragging its foot with SC2 never helped the scene at all.  GOM starting its own league by itself is really the unsung hero of SC2.  In the long run, there will be new tournaments, new leagues crop up, new players, new sponsors, as long as the enthusiasm is still there.  StarCraft II really is 'on its own' now that the brood war infrastructures are dying off.  I respect your opinion that this is a trend towards a very bad collapse but I see it as a chance that there is better out there even if its not apparent.  A StarCraft II rebirth isn't ever off the table if people still care about the game.  Sure that might be the biggest delusion a fan can have but I honestly can't rule it out.

WCS EU's tournament hitting 100k+ numbers.  A foreigner like Scarlett showing WCS KR's champion Maru who's boss at the korean final.  Jaedong desperately grabbing for his old tyrant title back.   Taeja beating Innovation in a macro match at the highest level TvT's seen.  Will there ever be a protoss dynasty?  My point is that the game is still amazing to watch and play which is what actually matters.  The rest is an advertising problem.  Crowds are still wild, WCS is getting better everyday, higher levels of play everyday to watch, weird new things to experience every once in a while (catz hatch anybody?), etc.

If I had a single gripe with the game is it really becomes stale to watch after watching hundreds (maybe thousands) of matches.  As with anything really it becomes old.  I just wished Blizzard added more reasons to open their game and play.  A faster schedule of new units, gameplay mechanics, game innovations, skins, unlockables, f2p ladder, etc.  It's like advertising an an old iphone when newer androids are out there.  I think WCS is great and all in the long run but I think Blizzard really should consider focus more improving the game which everything is built around.  People playing MOBA's can always expect new heroes and quirky compositions every few weeks but SC2 stays the same for years at a time.  Games that become less fun deserve to die off.

I'm probably way off topic at this point so I'll stop here.  Just going to saying this will all blow over and I'm not kidding myself.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; I'm a former Christian pastor who also studied for ~3 years for conversion to Orthodox Judaism before, eventually, becoming Hindu. With respect, I can assure you that the purpose of Judaism and Christianity is not to present an explanation on where the Universe came from. For example, a cursory reading of Genesis will demonstrate that barely any information is actually present, especially that information that can be tested

So, genesis does not tell the story of how god created the universe?  What was it about?

&gt; So what is the point of Judaism and Christianity? Well, you've heard it before from them but I'm going to go ahead and reiterate it anyway: love and respect. Kind of makes what's going on with, at least Christianity, a lot worse than just saying ""God made the Universe in six days,"" doesn't it? =(

So why are there so many examples of barbarism in the bible?  Things that any sane person would consider completely immoral today?

&gt; So if the core commandment, the cornerstone upon which the entire religion is built, is love and respect then why is that the one thing they most need to work on? Well, I could write a book on that! =D Basically it sums up to human nature. It's easier for me to try to change you than it is to try to change me and, when I fail, it's easier to persecute you while claiming that you're actually trying to persecute me than anything else. After all, you're the one really at fault for all the world's ills, not me! (Not really, I like you a lot and I'm sure you're a great guy! =D )

That's a laudable philosophy, my question is: why would a moral person require the threat of eternal damnation by an all-powerful creator to be moral?  Religion seems to be a way to scare people into the kind of moral behavior that atheists exhibit without any mythical threat.

&gt; So does this mean you need religion? If you think it'll help! Otherwise you know you better than anyone and I'm sure you're doing a great job at being the best you you can be! Keep up the good work! =D

So do you think that people should believe something simply because it will have a good outcome if they believe it?  I think you should only believe something if there is evidence that it is true, regardless of the consequences.","1377994064"

Hell even other kinds of white people had it pretty rough like the irish during the early 1800s. There are advantages and disadvantages to being any race. Blacks and latinos  have the advantage of affirmative action, asians and indians have the advantage of a strong cultural importance placed on school and professional acheivement. Whites get to be white. 

So yes it is bullshit that blacks with no criminal records are prefered to whites with one. That is awful.

On with your question, I think you should look into a different amplifier. Maybe the SR4? SR5? LRx4.1? (ok, kidding on the last one :-))
This seems to be the most cost effective approach, considering you will need an amplifier for the front speakers too. 

Rear speakers - Don't need these components. You can leave the OE speakers in there (if money is tight) OR install cheaper co-axials (probably from Hertz again). Spending too much money at the rear speakers is really not needed. They are insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

And *I* was wrong in my insistence that they aren't a little on the sexist side. They have a bunch of swim classes that are ""female only"", but no corresponding ""male only"" swims, which is not cool. And they also have a policy stating that if the demand for facility use is higher than the available time slots, women get priority - and that doesn't only go for the pool, it goes for all of Toronto's public park and recreation facilities (baseball diamonds included!). I think that sucks. 

But when I told my husband how much I think it sucks, he reminded me of Big Red, the University of Toronto and the huge rumble that happened there earlier this year (which pissed me off so much I decided never to think about it again, and forgot!), and of the fact that Toronto is actually a very strong feminist haven.

This make no sense. It's akin to saying that because there were anti-slavery campaigners in some parts of Europe, there was no need to have broader movement to oppose racism in the united states.

There's no call to treat non-offending pedophiles like human refuse. But there's also no call to act as though someone who was sexually abused doesn't go through hell, just as badly as any non-offending pedophile. 

One of my friend's father started sexually abusing him when he was two. He forced anal sex on my friend when he was only four years old, causing major pain and permanent physical damage. The abuse went on until my friend was 17. During his children, my friend's father shared him with other pedophiles, and made videos of him being sexually tormented and being forced into sadomasochistic activities. My friend has been raped by at least ten different people. His back is covered in scars from beatings. He has scars from bite marks on his inner thighs, and was burnt with cigarettes so he has scars from that as well. He also has physical pain whenever he goes to the bathroom, because of scarring from the rapes. His mental and emotional scars are too numerous to count. How dare you compare someone struggling with inappropriate urges to what my friend went through. 

It may not be a pedophile's fault that they have inappropriate urges, and as long as they are not expressing their urges through consumption of child porn or having sex with children, they have my sympathy. My brother molested me and two of my sisters, and I do not hate him, I feel sad that he has something wrong with him that ended up causing him to commit those crimes. But the victims deserve more sympathy, they didn't do anything and were harmed because of someone else's issues. You do not get to belittle survivors because you have an unfortunate desire.

So maybe after SAB stored the ""metadata"" from both servers and it knew to go to Astra for the other files? I have never tried clicking the ""retry"" link before.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Was waiting for our coaches to arrive to open our high school football complex and as a lot of kids had rode their bikes to practice that day we decided to kill some time by racing on the street leading up to the gate. 

After a few races, the same kid kept winning. Shit talking inevitably starts and since I was just recently named team captain and was on a testosterone fueled power trip, I decided that I would teach him who's boss. So I grabbed someone else's bike without asking and challenged this kid to race. 

We go back to the starting 'line' and because I care way more about this than my opponent I win the race easily. One problem: when I go to pull the brakes I get no response. Pull again, nothing. At that moment I look up to realize that I'm hurtling down the street at about 30 people with no way of slowing down. 
""Oh fuck""

I immediately start screaming ""No brakes!"" but it was too late obviously. I hit 5 or 6 people before careening into someone's front lawn and crashing pretty hard. I get up screaming at the kid who's bike I borrowed, ""Why the fuck didn't you tell me the bike doesnt have brakes!?"" 

He smirkes and says ""Because you didn't ask asshole."" 

Luckily no one got anything worse than a few bumps, scratches and cuts but my ego got one deep bruise that day. 

TL:DR Borrowed a friend's bike that didn't have brakes without asking to race someone; end up hitting a few teammates and making a general ass of myself. ","1377994086"

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt;Google made it, Google monitors it, and they're throwing intense amounts of money into it. Do you honestly believe they're going to release information that will hurt that?

They also paint their cars with massive colourful ""GOOGLE"" logos on the sides, and the current generation has a  prominent array of cameras and radar stuck on the roof. If one of them were in a serious accident, not even Google could cover it up!

&gt;I don't know how anyone could ever trust an automatic car like redditors seem to. Hell, Siri doesn't even recognize what I say until the third or fourth time I try it.

Human voice recognition is a very different problem, which is difficult for its own distinct reasons.

&gt;Automation at this large of a scope is a terrible idea.

I think this is the key point where you're wrong. Automation on a small scale - say, just a few thousand driverless cars on the road - would be problematic. The infrastructure to support them would be too costly, human drivers wouldn't know how to respond to them, etc.

But automation on a **large** scale - say, every car was driverless - would be super easy to implement. All the driverless cars could talk to each other and relay location and speed information; governments could install ""driverless car aids"" (e.g. embedded radar wave reflectors) as part of the road infrastructure; and all this would become very affordable owing to economies of scale. It's the *intial* startup that's going to be difficult.","1377994087"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A few weeks after I got my driver's license and a kind-of-old-but-nice sports car, I was driving at night on an unfamiliar country road. I was trying to keep up with a friend of mine, who was supposed to be leading me to where we were headed (this was before GPS was in anything but high-end luxury cars), and driving *way* too fast.

I had lost sight of my friend, and was doing about 80-85 when I saw a nasty, sharp turn up ahead. I just had this weird calm come over me, and while slamming my brakes I serenely told the girl in the passenger seat that we were going to crash. She naturally flipped the fuck out, and the car started tossing and banging around, but somehow remained upright. 

When we finally stopped moving, I found that the sharp turn was actually an S-turn, and I had gone over the corner and wound up back in the middle of the road, facing the wrong direction. When I walked outside to assess the damage, I saw the underbody lights (because those were *the shit* if you were a high schooler back then) were glowing up through the top of the body. I had pretty much completely torn off the front bumper, bent the front suspension to a point where one of the wheels was like an inch further back than it should have been, and narrowly missed a fence. That last part scared the shit out of me, because like a month earlier a friend of mine had been killed in a car accident where a fence post pretty much took his head off.

Anyhow, the car was still driveable, and I kept driving it in that condition for like four months until I was able to afford the repairs. I downed half a fifth of Bacardi 151 (a tenth?) after the crash, and that girl never rode in a car I was driving again. Oh well; I survived.","1377994090"

And other parts of syria that are much more kurdish predominately like in north east syria, they sided with the Syrian army since many kurds given the iraq experience are fearful of the mostly sunni rebels.","1377994098"

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","Z is ""distance into the screen"". The GLUunproject function converts a 3D point to another 3D point - in this case a point on your camera to a point in the world. Setting Z=1 gets you a point in front of the camera. You do it twice to get two points, which makes a ray. Intersect this ray with the ground and you're good.

Some psuedocode:

    //Get two points along the mouse ray
    gluUnProject(mx, my, 0, model_matrix, proj_matrix, viewport, &amp;X, &amp;Y, &amp;Z)
    gluUnProject(mx, my, 1, model_matrix, proj_matrix, viewport, &amp;X2, &amp;Y2, &amp;Z2)
    //Intersect the mouse ray with the Y=0 plane in world coordinates.
    x = Y / (Y - Y2) * (X2 - X) + X
    z = Y / (Y - Y2) * (Z2 - Z) + Z
    return (x, z)

Warning: untested. But some quick geometry led me to that answer. Here, mx and my are the mouse coordinates on the screen.

&lt;Edit&gt; By the way, in this case, the model matrix refers to the matrix used to transform the ground plane.","1377994099"

So I enter ""Premium Rush"" mode and start plotting all sorts of alternative routes. Eventually I recognize a barely big enough three lane spanning opening requiring me to dart from the last cash lane to the nearest ezpass lane cutting cars off and hoping no one speeds up or slows down so I can make it.

He then offers 5 reasons why 1) ""because we can"" 2) the U.S. has no real enemies 3) the all volunteer force 4) ""the establishment, stupid"" 5) congress has checked out.

But in the end it's just a list of symptoms:  ""I've no doubt that one could add more items to this list (e.g., the passive press, the military-industrial complex, etc.), but the items already noted go a long way to explaining why the supposedly peace-loving United States keeps finding itself in all these small but draining wars.""

Actually no, the symptoms do not explain the disease.  

The piece ends with a hint of the disease, one that Eisenhower warned about and has long ago reached cancerous proportions -

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","&gt; How do I convince my girlfriend to give up her career in art?

You don't.  The closest you can come is issue her an ultimatum about how she has to choose her art or you.  Even if she picks you and gives up her dreams, she's going to be bitter and angry with you, and it's more than likely going to destroy your relationship.

This is very, very similar to a disagreement over having kids.  If one partner wants to, and one partner does not, then the relationship is heading for a trainwreck, because there's no real compromise.  It's nothing to do with right and wrong; both partners are perfectly in the right, but they're also fundamentally wrong for each other.

If your dream is a relationship with two professional incomes, and your girlfriends dream is a career in art...then you guys need to break up and find compatible people, because one (or more likely both) of you are going to be unhappy when they have to give up their dreams.

(Also, ""My parents are pressuring me into breaking up with her because she is not serious about the future.""?  Really?  That's a pretty weird comment on a couple of levels.  First, you're an adult now.  Second, nothing you've said indicates to me that your girlfriend is not ""serious about the future"".  In fact, she sounds very serious about the future; she has a career mapped out, and is working to obtain advanced qualifications to enable that.  Not wanting to be a business analyst does not mean you aren't ""serious about the future""; it means you want a *different* future.  I also kind of question whether you really ""love [your] girlfriend to death""; if you truly love someone, I think that means loving the entire package.  And apparently art and her plans for a career in art are a big part of your girlfriends life.  Sounds more like you love parts of your girlfriend, or maybe you love the person you wish your girlfriend was.)

TL;DR:  I dunno, how does she convince you to give up your dream of her having a career as a business analyst?  Sounds just as fair, and just as impossible to me...","1377994108"

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","&gt;I assume that the experiencer is able to experience things with positive and negative affect.

As do I, but I believe prematurely ending something’s existence or capacity for sentience is a negative effective.

------
&gt;There are various possible explanations for sentience. Dualism, epiphenominal dualism, materialism, panpsychism, emergence, etc. Since there's really no information about how it arises, I think it's a bit early to make a firm declaration like you have done. (Personally, I'd tend to subscribe to the emergence theory.)

I don’t agree that it’s a “bit early” to come to my position.  I’m certainly not the first one who has:

From the Wikipedia article on sentience
&gt;Some philosophers, notably Colin McGinn, believe that sentience will never be understood, a position known as ""new mysterianism"". They do not deny that most other aspects of consciousness are subject to scientific investigation but they argue that subjective experiences will never be explained; i.e., sentience is the only aspect of consciousness that can't be explained.

From the Wikipedia article on New Mysterianism
&gt;In the view of the New mysterians, **their contention that the hard problem of consciousness is unsolvable is not a presupposition, but rather a philosophical conclusion reached by thinking carefully about the issue.** The standard argument is as follows:
&gt;&gt;Subjective experiences by their very nature cannot be shared or compared side-by-side. Therefore it is impossible to know what subjective experiences another person is having.

It is by this same foundation – that sentience is a permanently unsolvable problem – that I can’t agree with your claim that the probability of a rock’s sentience is very low.  I can’t make any statement on the probability of something existing if I know nothing of its nature or origin.

So I can say, “Other people seem to me to be sentient, because they are conscious and can communicate and do things with intent, like I, a sentient being, can,”  But I can’t say, “rocks don’t do things or communicate, so they probably aren’t sentient.”

As I said previously,
&gt;these things are not constituents of sentience. They are its derivatives. Therefore, while a rock (or a plant or microbe) does not display these indications of sentience, I cannot dismiss the possibility of its sentience. Again, this is because sentience is not a physical phenomenon, in my opinion.

Back to what you said:
&gt;I would agree that we cannot rule out a rock's sentience entirely but reasonably we should consider the probability very low. If you don't accept that line of reasoning, then you should have similar trouble with other possible scenarios that can't be ruled out: solipsism, brain in a vat, etc.

&gt;Basically, you're forced to pretty much take reality at face value even though there are contradictory scenarios that can't be entirely ruled out.

I do view the world this way.  I see no reason or explanation for our existence or the existence of anything.  My existence, that is, me as a subject and not only an object, is impenetrably confusing to me, and I think any explanation of the nature of our existence is as ridiculous and insufficient as any other. Simply put, there is no reasonable explanation, or there is no explanation accessible to the human mind.

------
&gt;1.	It is a bad thing if someone causes me to suffer or deprives me of pleasure.
2.	It is a good thing if I experience pleasure or avoid suffering.
3.	There are other individuals that can experience pleasure and suffering in a way comparable to the way that I do.
4.	Therefore it is a bad thing if individuals suffer/are deprived of pleasure and a good thing if individuals experience pleasure or avoid suffering.

&gt;The alternative to the conclusion in #4 is that my suffering/pleasure should somehow be considered different or exception simply because they are mine — even if there is no intrinsic quality that sets them apart from a dog's suffering or pleasure. That violates my sense of logical consistency to arbitrarily make an exception like that.

I don’t agree with your argument here.   I believe firmly that everyone has a limit to their empathy, and will always view themselves as an exception – not based on reason, but based on the immediacy of their subjective experience.  For instance, when faced with the last (vegan) cookie in a jar, do you eat it or offer it to split it with someone else?  For me, well…it depends on the person I’m sharing it with.  But I certainly put my own enjoyment over that of a stranger or acquaintance who might want a bite of my cookie.  Again, this isn’t because it’s fair for me to eat the cookie on my own, but because I, like every organism that has ever lived, am selfish to a degree. 

This is why your argument would not apply to someone without empathy, someone who has no limit to their selfishness.  They, like everyone, are compelled by their own subjective experience and by their own pleasure.  While they may logically agree with you, they would have no compulsion to act in accordance with your reasoning if it meant there would be any, even marginal deprivation of their own pleasure.  I think this is generally what occurs when x-vegans give up on their principles or when you’ve convinced someone of the merits of veganism but they still don’t change their lifestyle: the deprivation of their own pleasure, no matter how small, outweighs their feelings of empathy toward other subjects.  You need only look at all the x-vegans out there to see evidence of this.

------
I think there is a gap in your reasoning behind developing an objective moral framework.  While we feel physically and psychologically compelled to seek out “good” experiences and avoid “bad” experiences, what is our motivation for impacting these experiences in others?  For logical consistency?  That doesn’t really make any sense to me, unless I have some kind of compulsion to seek out/avoid certain experiences in others.  The truth is, assuming we are capable of empathy, we feel a similar compulsion for others as well.  That is the basis for moral action, in my opinion.  Things *feel* right or they *feel* wrong.

Now, we can use reason to expand this empathy to other situations, but we cannot remove ourselves from our empathetic axiom.

Therefore, I can go on and on trying to convince someone why they should become vegan, but they only need to say, “but I don’t give a shit,” to remove any basis for my argument.  You cannot make someone care if they truly don’t care.

Now if I want to convince someone that there is nothing morally wrong with homosexuality, I am not convincing them of a *correct* view, I am merely appealing to their intrinsic sense of empathy for other people.  I think it’s also worth noting that homophobia, in my view, does not come from an intrinsic sense of right and wrong, but from religious or cultural indoctrination.

China's Changbaishan volcano showing signs of increased activity
Posted By News On August 31, 2013 - 3:51pm

Roughly 1,100 years ago, the Changbaishan volcano that lies along the border between northeastern China and North Korea erupted, sending pyroclastic flows dozens of kilometers and blasting a 5-kilometer (3-mile) wide chunk off of the tip of the stratovolcano.

The eruption, known as the Millennium eruption because of its proximity to the turn of the first millennium, was one of the largest volcanic events in the Common Era. In the subsequent period, there have been three smaller eruptions, the most recent of which took place in 1903.

Starting in 1999, spurred by signs of resumed activity, scientists established the Changbaishan Volcano Observatory, a network to track changing gas compositions, seismic activity, and ground deformation. Reporting on the data collected over the past 12 years, Xu et al. find that these volcanic indices each leapt during a period of heightened activity from 2002 to 2006.

The authors find that during this brief active period, earthquake occurrences increased dramatically. From 1999 to 2002, and from 2006 to 2011, they registered 7 earthquakes per month using 11 seismometers. From 2002 to 2006, this rate increased to 72 earthquakes per month, peaking in November 2003 with 243 events.

Further, tracking the source of the earthquakes, the authors tie the bulk of the events to a region located 5 kilometers (3 miles) beneath the volcanic caldera, a source that slowly crept upward throughout the study period, suggestive of an ongoing magmatic intrusion.

Gas composition measurements collected from hot springs near the volcano showed spikes in carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, and nitrogen gases, which the authors suggest could be related to magmatic outgassing. Ground deformation studies, too, show a brief period of rapid expansion.

The authors suggest that though Changbaishan is likely not gearing up for an imminent eruption, one could be expected in the next couple of decades.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Ugh... this is what happens when journalists try to explain computer science. 

OK, let me try and do a better job. First the examples:


&gt;Rick Rashid was understandably nervous. As he stepped onto the stage to address 2000 researchers and students in Tianjin, China, he was risking ridicule. He did not speak Chinese, and his translator's poor skills in the past promised embarrassment.

&gt;""We hope that in a few years we'll be able to break down the language barriers between people,"" the senior vice-president of Microsoft Research told the audience. There was a tense two-second pause before the translator's voice came through.

&gt;Rashid continued: ""Personally, I believe this is going to lead to a better world."" Pause, repeat in Chinese.

&gt;He smiled. The crowd were applauding every line. Some people even cried. This seemingly overenthusiastic reaction was understandable: Rashid's translator had come far. Every sentence was understood and delivered flawlessly. And the most impressive part? The translator was not human.

&gt;These intelligent algorithms are beginning to influence every realm of life. A month after Rashid's speech, for example, the Netherlands Forensic Institute, in The Hague, employed a machine-learning system called Bonaparte to help find a murder suspect who had evaded capture for 13 years.

So far so good, many examples of soft AI working in the real word.

But here is where things get confusing:

&gt;Here, roughly, is how it works. Many of the most successful machine-learning systems are built on Bayesian statistics, a mathematical framework that lets us measure likelihood. It puts a number to the plausibility of an outcome, given the context and previously observed correlations in similar contexts.

Don't confuse Bayesian or other statistics with brute force machine-learning. 

For example, spam filtering uses a Bayesian approach to identify spam. This means that a lot of work has gone into fine tuning the Bayesian analysis of text. And then you give it a bunch of examples of spam and that's how it learns to identify them. 

This fine tuned machine learning is different from a brute force neural network approach.

A brute force approach is not fine tuned at all.  This is an example of the brute force approach trying to identify cats in Youtube videos: http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-triumph-of-artificial-intelligence-16-000-processors-can-identify-a-cat-in-a-youtube-video-sometimes/259001/

Four points about the brute force approach:

1. It requires shit tonnes of hardware to do anything interesting.
2. It is not very good even with incredible amounts of shit tonnes of hardware.
3. We don't know exactly what it is doing once it is trained.
4. Chomsky really hates that.


Now  you are asking yourself could be use a Bayesian approach to identify cats? 

Yes! With a bit of human fine tuning we could use a tonne less hardware and do a much better job. It would still be machine learning, we would just put more intelligence into it first. Also we would know exactly how and why it works.

Chomsky does not have a problem with that.

Now you are asking yourself, then what is the point of brute force neural network machine learning?

There really is no point yet.

At some point in the future affordable hardware could be so powerful that we could use to to identify cats in videos as well as a  human or better. And do it all with absolutely no extra human effort. 

But if we had hardware that powerful it is extremely likely we would have a true hard AI. And if we had hard AI we are well into or past the singularity and none of this shit matters anymore. 

But you can sort of see the elegance of being able to teach a machine to do anything just by creating a big enough neural network. And keep in mind people in the 1950s thought we'd have computers that powerful by the 1970s.  

And its is only when we snapped out of that dream and started doing smarter AI work, like the statistical approach, that we ended the AI winter.

In fact, the only problem with going backwards is that fruit trees you've harvested won't bear fruit again. Oh, and the fact that you'll need to travel forwards again. xD

But as long as you stay either side of 6am, say between 6:01 am on the 1st of September, and 5:59 am on the 2nd of September (which is the next day, not *today's* day, obviously. xD) you'll be absolutely fine! :)","1377994136"

If you want to brew at the university, that might be tricky. Fire safety and food safe laws might cause the university to block most of your efforts.

Video game development is still huge, with more money being pumped in than ever.

In Canada the federal government has a program to retrain people in relevant trades. My mom took it to much effect.

I am not judging quickly, I was literally asking a question as I am truly interested. Did these people take soft degrees such as arts or did they take Business/technical degrees ? Answering that question will help to guide the youth of today.

Yeah, I think I will leave it alone, there's not much I can do. There's a store near me that lets me try a DENVER amplifier, [Denver CAP-4200](http://www.denver-electronics.com/denver-cap-4200/), but I don't know how to wire it, and I will probably need to buy some cables/wires, etc.

I would read about car audio, I've searched a lot, on this subreddit, there isn't that much information, it just gives recommendations on brands, it isn't that much specific or technical.

I think it's properly wired, or I'm sure it's properly wired on the speakers, don't know if it's properly wired in the radio/whatever it should be wired to.

Speakers are mounted solidly, yes.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","&gt; For whatever reason, that was their choice, some people don't want to learn Linux, some people need Windows for compatibility with work software, others don't know any better.

You make a really good point. This rings true for any operating system/choice of computer, really. 

So what if you have a PC? Who cares if you use OS X? Who gives a damn if you use Linux? If it works for them and they're happy with their setup, whether it be PC, Mac, or Linux, who are you to say they're wrong for using what they're happy with, regardless of their level of computer literacy, how much they spent, or personal UI preference?

For example, it annoys me to no end when someone asks for software help for Mac, or asks an honest question about Mac compatibility, and the first response is almost always: ""Get a PC."" And then when someone complains about viruses on their PC, one of the answers is almost always something along the lines of: ""Macs and Linux don't get viruses as much."" It's present on every side, whether it be PC vs. Mac or Mac vs. Linux or Linux vs. PC.

Seriously, I wish those types of people would just get off their high horse and just help someone/answer a question when someone makes an honest inquiry (if they can). And if they can't answer it, either ignore the thread or just be kind and help them search for an answer instead of being unhelpful or an overall asshat.","1377994148"

But beating yourself up and taking your mother's words so personally, when she was lashing out of frustration for the door being unlocked and the risk to the home, is you believing your worth depends upon another's opinion.  It doesn't.  

Your mom was scared and tried to scare you to change your behavior.  Her best mothering effort is a poor motivator for someone with Aspergers since you probably are already very hard on yourself.  So, forgive her too.  You both probably did your best and missed the mark.  Forgiving yourself and others during these struggles, plus not taking other's words and thoughts as affirmation that you are worse than any other foibled human will always be a healthier coping mechanism than just believing what someone else says or thinks outright.  

Remember: Nobody is perfect.  The best any of us can do is admit mistakes, learn from them and move on to try and try again.  Dragging around all that baggage from other people's judgements just makes that journey so much harder.    

In the meanwhile, the better bet to help you alter your behavior is to work with your habits and tendencies to find a way to work locking the door into your routine.  When you figure out to make Aspergers work for you, life will get easier.  ","1377994152"

"browsers","t5_2qh5r","What I would recommend is to think of a memory upgrade as an option to extend the life of the machine until you do decide to replace it. It will give you some breathing room.

Software projects inevitably require more and more memory, because new features are added all the time leading to [software bloat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat). If Chrome and Opera aren't doing it then the other options most of us would recommend, Safari or Firefox won't either.

Your choices, given your current machine will be 1) to add RAM to accomodate newer versions of most browsers more effectively, 2) stick with older versions of browsers as you have 3) Try clearing out some other programs to give more to your browser from the existing pool.

In all honesty the single best thing you can do with any machine is to upgrade the memory to the maximum it can handle, even if you turn off other programs. I have machines from 2003 that I can still use effectively (though with Linux distro's like Crunchbang) because that. Though I generally don't have too many programs running in addition to the browser. I have newer machines that, before I turn off a number of programs, run out of memory with 2GB total.","1377994161"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I have been eyeing this camera for a while now.  This in my mind would be a perfect travel photography camera and street photograpghy camera.  Initially I was put off my its large depth of field but later realized this to be a strength rather than a weakness.  Granted now a days we orgasm over SDOF and bokeh but for travel and street photography two most important aspect is context (environment) and lens speed.  Being a small 2/3 inch sensor this will gather large DOF hence you will easily capture context and being a f2-2.8 lens throughout you will have a relatively fast aperture.  Infact even with a 50mm f1.4 lens to get large DOF you will have to stop down to f8 or more but that means in dark environments it will need higher ISO or slower shutter (none of which can be a good choice in my opinion).

Even though I do not own one I would be putting this on the top contender's list for travel photography.  Also not being a interchangeable lens the fixed lens negates issues of sensor dust etc. another potential hazard for travel photoshoots.

Goodluck with your voyage and keep us posted on your experience and pictures.

Accessory wise you can get a lens hood adapter from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/EzFoto-52mm-Filter-Adapter-Lens/dp/B0069K42HC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377994333&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=x20+lens+hood) for ~$10-$15 and [a decent 52mm(?)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The Horrors of a Tonsillectomy

It all began Wednesday morning, September 7 of 2011, at about 4 o'clock. At this point I'm about a week and a day after my surgery and figuring that I'm out of the woods for anything crazy to happen. I am, however, still on my horrid tasting pain medication (liquid oxycodone and acetominaphen) God because artificial cherry isn't bad enough they decided to add mint to it as well.

So I think about getting up to take it and bide my time as always, trying to put it off just a little bit longer. Finally get out of bed and into the bathroom probably some time between 4:15 and 4:20. Measure out the dose and mix it in some water so that it doesn't stick to my mouth so badly on the way down. Wince through the burn and the taste that comes with it, and then proceed to clean out the cups as usual.

After this I decide that while I'm up I should remove some excess fluids from my system. Probably less than a minute into this is when things started to get interesting. I suddenly taste blood in my mouth . . . lots of it. So, still sitting on the toilet, I spit between my legs to get rid of it. Much to my surprise what came out of my mouth was several very large clots of blood. And then it starts really gushing. There's so much and it's coming out so fast that I can literally hear it squirting out and hitting my throat. Now, having been in the military and having at least a little bit of first aid training, I have some idea of what an arterial bleed would look like. Bright red blood that spurts along with your pulse . . . pretty much the two key things, and what was happening to me fit the bill. Also, for those that don't know, you can bleed out and die from one in a matter of a couple of minutes. Was I scared? . . . I was terrified. I've never been as sure that I was about to die as I was at that very moment.

At this point I've got the trash can pulled around in front of my with the lid thrown off and am continuing to hemorrhage blood into it. I can't even spit it out fast enough to gulp air every now and then, so I'm swallowing blood to manage and then puking it back out. Around a mouthful, I yell at Matt to help me and a few seconds later he's in there too asking me what to do. All I can manage is ""ICE!"" because some small, still sane part of my brain, remembers that gargling ice water might slow or stop the bleeding . . . of course they never warned me there would be so much, so I was still thinking I was a goner at this point just willing to try anything. He comes back with the tray and obviously caught on quick about what needed to be done, as he threw several pieces into the cup that was still on the sink and filled it with water. I went through the whole tray, melting every last piece down to nothing, and still continued to bleed. At this point Matt's on the phone trying to call the number they gave us for questions at the hospital, the doctor, and, after failing with the previous one's, 911. He was smart about it and tried to give the ice some time to work before having them send an ambulance. Matt made the 911 call at 4:34am.

During this whole ordeal I keep thinking of how Matt must be feeling and how all this must look to him. He absolutely cannot stand it when I'm hurt, so usually when I do get hurt I will hide it from him and if it's noticeable tell him about it later, just to not freak him out. Obviously this whole scene was like something out of a bad horror movie, to say the least and I just knew that even if I made it through he was going to have nightmares for a month after this. Also, I'm not a very religious person, but I was not ready to die and was praying to God very fervently in my head that I would make it.

After going through our second and final tray of ice, the bleeding finally slowed and eventually stopped. We're still both thoroughly freak(ed)ing out, but with the bleeding stopped we're able to think a bit more clearly. The ambulance is also on it's way and we're both rather lacking in the clothing department and I'm covered in blood all down my front from gargling. So I quickly wipe off the most substantial patches of blood and then get up and carefully make my way around the room getting clothes on.

I was probably standing for a total of a minute and a half before the room started going dark. I told Matt I was passing out and then that I couldn't see as I sat on the edge of the bed. I'm completely blind and losing consciousness fast. Matt takes me and lays me down on the floor. We thought I was passing out from blood loss. He called 911 a second time at 4:44am. The fact that I'm now blacking out after we thought I was going to be okay seemed pretty much like a sick joke because suddenly it seemed like my life was in peril once more. Although I was still scared, at this point it felt like I'd given up and apparently loosing all the blood from your head makes everything feel really peaceful much like finally getting to sleep after being deprived of the ability for several days. All I remember after that is telling him that I was sorry (for all that I was putting him through, potentially dying, and the bills that would surely come of this - although I didn't say any of this because I didn't want to scare him anymore) and that I loved him and asking him where the ambulance was. He said later that I went really pale, my lips went a pale purple, and my eyes dilated so far that my irises were next to nonexistent. He says I was out for maybe 45 seconds to a minute and a half before I started telling him that I was starting to be able to see again. The room was like a strange sepia with really strong painful outlines.

By the time the paramedics got into our apartment I was fully conscious and aware again and, still on my back, was able to answer the questions they had about what had happened. Eventually, I was able to slowly get up and walk down the stairs and then get on the gurney, which was then wheeled into the back of the ambulance. Nothing real special, pretty much exactly as they look in the movies, heh.

Matt, once again the quick thinker, quickly called up Jill, our wonderful friend and daycare provider, and set up to bring Chloe over to her place on the way to the hospital. Mind you it's only a little after 5am so it's a small miracle that she answered her phone. Matt says that he apologized for it and she told him off saying something like, ""I lost an hour of sleep, Jess might have bled out, I think she wins this one.""

I was in the hospital until about 9:30am and during that time I received 2 liters of IV fluid, a blood draw (to count it) and a quick once over from the ER doctor. They told me my blood count was ok, both red and white, so obviously I'd passed out from terror and not blood loss. The also informed us that although it's uncommon for this sort of thing to happen so late in the recovery, it does happen on occasion and that it's not something to freak out so badly over. Would that they had warned us of this in the first place, or at least given us an idea of the sheer amounts that were possible and not just saying ""brief periods of bleeding can be controlled by gargling ice water . . ."" After the ER doc gave the doctor that performed the tonsillectomy a call, he relayed the instructions (gargle with ice water every hour) then set me up with my discharge papers and tried to assure me that a recurrence is very rare (of course, so was it occurring in the first place).

We went home and relaxed, took a long nap, played a bit of Minecraft, and tried to avoid thinking about that morning and the possibility of a recurrence. An extremely difficult feat to accomplish I will tell you right now, without going into further details.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I don't find doing pointless things fun. The combat in Oblivion and Skyrim was slightly better, but it was still bad combat compared to other games. None of the quests were fun because the game played them for me with the quest compass, telling me where to go and what to do, and in Oblivion, everything was scaled so there was no sense of progression or achievement. The only ""fun"" things were within the first few hours of playing going through dungeons and playing with physics, before you realized that there were 200 dungeons all made by the same poor bastard and most of them pointless.

Finding a dungeon in Morrowind felt important because there were far fewer of them, and each one told a story, and they were NOT pointed out to you by a stupid compass 10 minutes before you're in sight range of them. 

I got EMOTION from Morrowind. The game was so well written, the world so well built, that you could get entirely sucked into it. Oblivion and Skyrim are riddled with awful hackey writing that pulls you out constantly, like a cheesey big budget summer movie. Oh you start the tutorial finding out you're the chosen one? Well, not really the chosen one, you've got destiny, you're chosen to... be the chosen one's errand boy. Okay that's...cool I guess? Must defend against this horrible civil war and daedra invasion that... no one else seems to care about, and except for portals appearing in the woods now and then, there's no evidence of any impending threat... 

Eck, just such a poorly realized game. 


Basically what you're saying is, you like Skyrim's combat. And that is enough to call the game better than Morrowind. That just sounds absurd to me. If Skyrim had really great combat, that'd be one thing, but combat is often the most criticized part of Skyrim.","1377994170"

Exactly! You have shoulder pads and a helmet for a reason and the defender's job is to get the offensive player on the ground. This is football! Hitting is expected! It's easy for fans, refs and announcers to nitpick after the fact , but in a split second between ""runner"" and ""slider"" the defender has to make a choice whether to continue on his assignment, or bail instantly. At least with a runner heading out of bounds the defender has the visual cue of the white sideline so he can adjust his timing accordingly.

For me, the problem isn't so much the penalty call, it's the automatic ejection of the defensive player regardless of the situation. It's not as if the defender was intentionally trying to knock out or injure an opposing player, and this seems like a move by the referees to legitimize the new rule. The call itself is very subjective and will continue to be a point of contention throughout the season, slowing down games and making referees more a part of the game than they should be.

He took a community from DELTA that was there on their own right, and while I understand people want to play with him (he is very good at minecraft ingame), and be part of a cool community, its still kinda a dick move to ""mine resources from someone else biome"". (And it does violate the ToS, but who reads those anyways). I truly thought all of this was far behind us, as DELTA has certainly changed quite a bit since Jay left, new games, new world, new plugins, etc. and I am sure NewEra has made some adjustments along the way as well. But I guess if I had not been upset that Jay took a great community with him, I might have been more lenient with someone posting a server address in public chat. Although leniency is what allowed Ray to cheat for so long as a Moderator, and has admitted he no longer wishes to be part of the community, and that he was asking other players to join his server.

I might use the number and type of fallacies a person is committing as a gauge of how much effort it would be to get the other person to a self-consistent argument that I could deal with; that judgment lets me decide whether it's worthwhile to continue the argument.

The gondolas in our stores went almost up to the ceiling, so I had to get onto a tall ladder to do it.  I had a box of twenty four wine glasses sitting on the top of the ladder (about eight feet off the ground), and when I turned to move something, I accidentally bumped the box with my hip.  I saw them fall in slow motion, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.

For example, you get the illusion of faster movement, which (IMO) leads to more fast-paced gameplay. The crosshairs are projected better on lower resolutions and the pixels are bigger, which means they're harder to miss. Plus, if you play smart, you will usually already be looking in the direction you expect the enemy to come from; the wider FOV gives you almost nothing that you can use, and 4:3 gives better FPS and smoother mouse movement.","1377994172"

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt; Every last one of those cited a race, but not a propensity to behave in that way based on skin color alone.

But it's NOT MY POSITION that propensity to behave violently is ""based on skin color alone"".  You are strawmanning my position.  I used to think that you were *just* a liar, but now I am starting to believe that you are a *monumentally stupid* liar.  The first cue into this is when you betray your ignorance by calling race ""skin color"", even when [microsatellite marker studies show that race is biological](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196372/), races have different [blood type distribution](http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_3.htm),[risk of various diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_health), [bodyfat distribution](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobes/2011/159373/fig1/)([here as well](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/91/1/7.full.pdf)), [gestation period](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/1/107.full) and [puberty onset](http://www.jwatch.org/jw200109180000005/2001/09/18/earlier-onset-and-racial-differences-puberty).

For all of the rap you give my position that racial crime differences are mostly genetic, you have yet to address that you posited a hypothesis (poverty) that is *at least twice as bad as the racial hypothesis, whether or not the racial hypothesis is true or not*. 

 When I called you out that my position is at least twice as good as yours using linear correlation as a proxy for accuracy, your strategy was to stop talking about your shitty hypothesis and instead focus on raising the bar on mine.  I don't need studies *from birth* to infer the narrow-sense heritability of criminality.  I infer it from 1) the lack of importance of proxies for socioeconomic status compared to the importance of racial composition and 2) studies on the general narrow-sense heritability of crime showing the criminality is partially genetic.

&gt;God, this is delicious how much you are setting yourself up for failure but refuse to believe it. You're trying to dismiss it ""I might as well argued with my dog."" This is a last resort to someone who has no leg to stand on. I'm enjoying this, baby.

So, I'm the one dismissing things because I put a small quip at the end of my lengthy post that outlined *very meticulously and specifically* why I believe that my positions are correct? Your asinine demand for ""skin color *from birth* correlated with higher crime"" isn't effectively a dismissal?  You pulling out of your ass that ""this is a last resort to someone who has *no* leg to stand on"" isn't an off-hand dismissal?  You smugly proclaiming how much you're ""enjoying this, baby"", isn't a distracting obfuscation meant for the express purpose of dismissal?  ","1377994175"

"pitbulls","t5_2qjof","I was the VP of a pit bull rescue for two years and I can tell you that, at least if you go the adoption route, you can almost definitely find the type of dog you are looking for. You can checkout petfinder and look for an all breed, or pit bull specific rescue group and check out all of the dogs that they have to offer. I would lean towards rescues that have their dogs in foster care so you will know how the dog reacts in a home environment. When I fostered, I would quickly find out if the dog was active or lazy, good with cats and other dogs (there are 4 dogs and 4 cats living in my house), fearful or outgoing, basically anything you would want to know about a dogs behavior. 

As far as pit bulls being human aggressive or ""lashing out"", this is absolutely not a normal behavior for the breed. I have fostered 5 pit bulls in my home and been around lots of others and this was never an issue, though we do screen the dogs before taking them into the rescue. It's kind of ridiculous how some of the most battered, neglected, and abused pit bulls would still go up to a stranger and lick them all over. Right now I have my room mates rescue pit licking my face and she has BB's under her skin from where someone apparently shot her. They are extremely resilient and sweet dogs for the most part. 

As far as other animal aggression, you will have to be observant of your dog's behavior and, if you rescue, make sure you get the dog from a good rescue group that thoroughly temperament tests their dogs. My roommate's pit bull lives with four cats and could care less about them and my parent's rescue pit does too. That is just anecdotal evidence but they definitely can live with other animals peacefully. I would just be more vigilant with a pit bull when out around other new dogs. Don't bring them to off leash dog parks unless you are absolutely sure that they are tolerant of other dogs. At our local dog park, we have plenty of people bring their pits and have never really had an issue. There will always be scuffles, and dog parks are stressful for even the best behaved dogs so it's kind of a toss up. 

All in all, pit bulls are a wonderful breed. I've heard a lot of people say that they were skeptical about them at first but now would not own any other type of dog. They are loyal, cuddly, and lots of them are really goofy and silly. Good luck and post some pictures on here if you end up adding a pit bull to your family!","1377994176"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am no doctor, so take this advice for just what it is, a suggestion that might or might not help, and I cannot be responsible if it causes harm, so maybe google it a bit before trying.






I was shown this 25 + years ago and I honestly can't remember were or whom showed it to me, but it has worked for me on a few occasions, but I don't suffer from anything other than a rare occasional migrane.






if you run your fingers/thumbs along the underside of your brow , towards the center you should notice an indentation on both sides. ( in other words there will be one each above each eye  for a total of two, sorry if I worded that funny )






 If you press in fairly hard and deep on those indents it should hurt a bit and you need to do it for 5-15 seconds at a time, but it should relieve some pressure if you have a migrane a few seconds after releasing.





 Again, I am not a doctor and am not offering medical advice.

Loose trucks save lives. If you just tighten the truck you can't turn....if a car pulls out in front of you, you are screwed.

Here are some tips for going fast:

*Start on smaller hills,get use to going 15-20,that will build up ankle strength and make you less twitch.
*Once you are okay going 20ish,find a bigger hill and start half way up,if you don't get wobbles move up 15 feet. Keep making your way up until you get wobbles. When you get to that point practice from that point until you don't get wobbles.
*WEAR A HELMET. If you are going fast your head will hit VERY hard,and there is a good chance you will die if you don't have one and don't know how to properly fall at those speeds.
*Did I mention wear a helmet?
*If your trucks are pretty loose look into getting harder bushings for your trucks,it will still allow you to turn,but will make for a more stable ride.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt; Out of all the studies I presented, I thought only one relied on vignettes but it was actually two, and that makes me a liar? 

I think it makes you disingenuous.  It was you who mentioned Sadalla.  You claimed that your sources debunked Sadalla, and maybe.  The point I'm speaking to is that the methodology used in the studies which debunk really doesn't say anything at all because attraction isn't a rational thought process.  Reading a vignette and then asking a series of questions is a rational process.  Trying to understand something that is more instinctual than rational through a purely rational process?  If you pull the other one, it plays show-tunes.

And truth be told, I'm aware of several ways that science is manipulated, I believe it's called confirmation bias.  

So we have a number of studies which don't really say much of anything about attraction, because attraction isn't rational.

That being said, some guys still wanna get laid, and you know what?  If they wait around for the science to be settled, they might as well be waiting for the 2nd comming.  Thankfully for them, there's other evidence to consider.  What have the two hottest selling series of novels in women's literature been in the past say, five years?  The Twilight Series, and the Fifty Shades of Grey series, and the latter is all about sexual surrender to a dominant, high-status man.  

And it's not like they don't have their predecessors, perhaps you've heard of a little company known as Harlequin Enterprises?  

If you want TRP to believe that dominance doesn't have a place in the attraction picture, or doesn't have a place in an effective strategy then perhaps you should have a word with western women, because it sure looks to me like they didn't get the memo.","1377994179"

It was pouring rain all night - not storming, just torrents of rain. With him getting lost, we're way late to the movie we want to see. So we end up going out to a local pizzeria for dinner. We get the world's worst waitress - horrid service and she leaves without telling/asking anyone to cover her table. So after pretty much forcing another server to print us a check, we leave and are late to the movie again. We end up picking another at random. On the way home, we go through a turn light and the truck behind us runs the red light and tries to swerve around us way over the speed limit. So we end up in a car accident (not too serious - no one hurt) and wait over an hour for a cop to show up to file a police report. By this time, his mom had shown since we was going to need a way home. The guy is pale and freaking out since it was the first accident he had ever been in and keeps asking if I'm okay and alternating asking if my mom was going to kill him or let me go out with him again. I eventually get dropped off and with our parents staring on, there was no goodnight kiss.

Massage therapy will sometimes have benefits, when it's based on trigger points. Otherwise it's useless for anything other than placebo. Physical therapy isn't going to be effective without adjustments. That would be as stupid as engaging in PT for a broken bone before it has been set and has healed.

&gt;You need to back up your claim that chiropractors are better at physical therapy than physical therapists, despite not knowing that is what they are doing.

They know exactly what it is that they're doing. It's not placebo if I'm injured and can't participate in an activity, receive an adjustment, and then can participate in the activity, when I already have the mental fortitude to ignore the majority of my injuries and fight through them. If it's just pain, it doesn't stop me. Only being unable to actually move my body in a certain fashion does.

In the accurate half, 5%-10% actually was telling the American citizens what Congress legalized in the Patriot Act.  The government doesn't have a problem with him whistleblowing with that information.  The problem is where Snowden then continues to tell classified information about our cyber warfare going on with other superpowers around the world.  I, personally, don't think he had authorized access to those documents.  I think he accessed documents he shouldn't have and then released them.  That is treason (releasing our war strategies [especially on cyber warfare, the most common wars seen today]).  It may even count as espionage.  People won't see it as a fair trial if he returns, but he will most likely spend the rest of his life in prison for treason and espionage, 2 crimes he is guilty of.","1377994191"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm a gay dude who worked as a male escort for while. I'd been curious about it for some time, after having a female friend who did very well for herself and ended up putting herself through school on the funds. At the time, I was hating the long hours at my corporate job, and my thought process had been sort of, ""I'm good-looking, get off on sketchy situations, and I have terrible standards, shouldn't I be leveraging those assets?"" My boyfriend moved from another city to mine in the spring, and cash was tight while he was looking for a job, so it felt like the time to satisfy my curiosity was at hand. I knew he wouldn't object: he has his own relativel well known semi-amateur pornographic career and his fans were regularly sending us gifts of dildos and underwear. So I cleared it with him and put an ad up on a website.

The first trick I turned was a kind of handsome dude whose boyfriend had sent him to go pay and get fucked as a part of a Dom/sub humiliation thing they were doing. I wanted some practice and so I told him I'd do 30min for $80. He kept saying, ""I've never done anything like this before,"" (meaning pay for an escort). I neglected to tell him it was also my first time. I gave him a good pounding but was too thrown off by the novel situation to finish easily within 30min, so I charged him $60 and sent him on his way.

After that, I started consistently charging $200/hour, which is very realistic for a good looking escort of my age in my city. I kept seeing a client or two a week for the next few months. I had two regulars: one was a kind of pleasant, unassuming dude who was an interior decorator and who wanted to have some of the most boring, vanilla sex I've ever had. The other was the manager of a major hospital in another, smaller city who would come to the city I lived in most weekends, do a fuckton of drugs (I did not partake, but the boyfriend affectionately nicknamed him ""meth daddy""), and have the dirtiest sex all night. I'd usually go see him for an hour or two on the weekends. I have a pretty wide range of activities I've entertained in my casual sex life, but this guy had a few things that pushed my limits - like the time I was asked to punch him in the balls for half an hour, which was somewhere between fun and nauseating.

The whole setup had the kind of fun moments you'd expect - I fucked an executive from an airline in his top-floor suite on the waterfront (he had a ton of bondage gear and wanted me to be as rough as possible), my boyfriend and I cleared $1,300 for a relatively brief threesome with the hospital manager, and I got to see an interesting side of people's sexuality that most guys don't get to witness, which was very interesting. I found it was easier to manage the money I made hooking than it was to manage my regular salary - when the hours I put in were so directly connected to the money I made, I became frugal and business-oriented in a way I hadn't seen in myself before. The whole experience kind of made me decide escorting full time wasn't for me but would be an acceptable fall back in any further times of trouble, and that I should probably pursue a career where I could freelance more.

The boyfriend eventually got a job, I quite escorting, and I'm working towards getting into a place where I can pursue that freelance career. 10/10 would punch a dude in the balls for cash again","1377994193"

A friend from work takes me out to Harris Lake on his boat and we catch a lot of panfish there on the fly and some bass as well. There are lots of spots at Harris that you can wade and catch some fish.

The guys from Orvis in Raleigh take people out to Durant Park or the Neuse at Falls Dam and they catch a lot there. 

I had good luck last weekend with panfish over at Regency in Cary. There is a small lake at the Koka Booth amphitheatre, lots of bass there but didn't land any.

Probably some decent spots at Falls Lake if you have some waders or hip boots but I haven't had a chance to try it out. Definitely join Triangle Fly Fishers on Meetup, they organize some trips in the area as well as the western part of NC to fish for trout.

However Guards using Crossbows Oneshot me on Master Difficulty. Now I have 450+ Health and max Armor (75% damage reduction). I checked and the Guard in question had a Marksman skill of 79 so even if ASIS gave him as many Archery Perk Points as possible, he shouldn't have been able to reach more than 80% Armor Penetration. Even if he had 100% AP, Master Difficulty doubles the damage I take. Mpre than 225 Damage with one Shot seems too much, considering the fact that I have an Archery Skill of 73 and 26% Bonus Archery dmg Enchantments and my Crossbow only deals 98 dmg. 

Even weirder, upon lowering the difficulty to Adept, his dmg dropped to about 90 per hit. Do either SkyRe, ASIS or DC change the way the Difficulty Levels work? In Vanilla Skyrim, Master Difficulty meant taking double damage while only dealing half. Was this somehow changed? It seems like I'm taking at least 5 times as much damage on Master Difficulty than I did on Adept.","1377994199"

Noticing Hiroku approaching me, limping noticably, but apparent that his Kaidō had managed to heal him significantly more than I had anticipated, especially considering how briefly he had had the opportunity to utilise his skills. 

Starting to lose patience at Hiroku's passive stance, refusing to attack, and just healing up any wound I deal, or alternatively, kiting me with an assortment of iritating Kidō, I decide attack him head on. He isn't much faster than me, he is still limping, plus he may not expect it without my knives. If I can get a hand on him, I can probably push him enough to at least fight in a manner I can take seriously, maybe I would even consider reusing my knives. 

Seeing Hiroku gesture towards me, I decide against my plan. I'm not going to let him dictate what I do. I don't care if I'm being childish.. Instead, I just turn my back to him, and take a few steps, making sure to listen out for any signs of attack, knees bent, muscles tensed, in case I needed to dodge, then I turn back around to face him.","1377994201"

Please get a second opinion from a psychiatrist.  Bipolar disorder and SSRI's do not mix unless a person is on a lot of mood stabilizing medication as well and even then they usually don't mix.

Sex also appears as a base need along with food, water, and shelter, because it is most certainly possible for someone who is hungry and thirsty to also be so horny that they'd forsake food and water to get off.

His living arrangements really have nothing to do with you and aren't your business. Will irrational feelings of insecurity and jealousy come up? Probably. Is that common? Yes. But they're your feelings to deal with and not a valid reason to think you can try to control your boyfriend's behavior to make them go away. 

Because guess what? Uncomfortable feelings arise in every relationship worth having. If you get your way and prevent your boyfriend from living with a woman, difficult feelings about something else will come up. Will you try to make him change to run away from them too? 

Sorry to bring the tough love on here. But I think your relationship is doomed if you start thinking irrational feelings about things like this mean it's ok to boss your boyfriend around. ","1377994205"

The first thing I thought was ""I am so fucked."" knocked on the dudes door (who was pretty chill about the situation) and we exchanged insurance info.

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","Sorry for the long post. My husband (who was diagnosed a few years back) and I have 3 kids, 2 of whom are his biologically (he adopted my daughter, who also has bipolar, from a previous relationship). Our youngest, who is 14, was diagnosed about a year ago. My husband had a lot of guilt when we found out and said that he wished he had known. I can't say that we would have done it differently because I look at my son and the insane amount of joy and comic relief he brings into my world and would do it all over again. 
 
I will say that I wish we had known what to look for earlier. We spent several years in Hell with my daughter until we got her diagnosed and found the right medication. I will always regret not figuring it out sooner. She was miserable, we were miserable and it caused a lot of damage to our family. That being said, once on the right meds she became a happy (most days) teenager who has a family who understands and  will help her learn how to manage her condition. 
We will never tell them it is all in their head. Or any of the things I see here that parents with no understanding of the condition say. I have more patience when one of them is manic or depressed because I now know how little control they have over it at times. I think that the earlier you as a parent know, the better. Having 3 out of the 5 people living under one roof living with bipolar isn't everyone's ideal, but it certainly is never boring. 

Our daughter won a city wide art contest last summer and our son is one of the best basketball players in his school. My husband is the best father I have ever met. My world is a much better place for having them in it. ","1377994215"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordyce_spots




It could also be pearly penile papules, which aren't infectious and typically found around the ""crown"" of the penis (the bottom portion of the head of the penis). However, these are typically a little bit larger than Fordyce spots, which makes me think it may be those.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsuties_coronae_glandis





Finally, it could be penile psoriasis, which is a type of skin disease. It's very similar to eczema. Psoriasis can be treated with special creams that you can get from your doctor. It is not an infectious disease, but you may want to see the doctor to verify that it's one of these three.




http://voices.yahoo.com/what-penile-psoriasis-5975176.html?cat=70




The best result is, as I and others have said, go see the doctor. Spots on the penis *generally* are harmless, but it never hurts to check. It'll also make your SO feel a bit more comfortable, and the two of you can go back to having a healthy, sexual lifestyle.","1377994217"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I live in Dallas and in early 2011 when the GB Packers were in town for the superbowl, we were having quite the winter ice storm. (On Texas standards, a little frost is too much for most people.) Actually, we had quite a bit of ice, at least 4 inches thick on some parts of the highways. Well, the day that the storm hit I was supposed to go to my first day on the job. I remember driving by the DFW airport on 114 and most of everyone on the highway was going about 40mph. I had both hands on the wheel and, while still travelling forward my jeep grand cherokee decides to do a full clockwise spin, while still moving forward at 40 mph.... I'm 90degrees into the turn when I realized ""oh shit the walls are pretty close... and I'm going pretty fast...""
at the 180degree mark, I was still travelling in the same direction at the same speed, but facing the opposite direction. I actually remember seeing the face of the driver behind me saying ""OH SHIT!"" and we made eye contact!
At the 270 degree mark into the spin, I realized the other wall was getting pretty close as well... Luckily there weren't any other cars around me except for the freaked out driver not far behind me. 
Finally at the 360 mark, one full spin, still moving the same speed in the same direction, my tires caught dry pavement, and I just coasted through like nothing happened. ","1377994222"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","While I will give you the sources, it doesn't take much to verify them outside of a basic google search and some basic biology knowledge.  I don't know if you're a troll or just ignorant.  Either way, here are the relevant links to the argument I was making.

Evidence for Pack behavior: http://science.slashdot.org/story/07/10/30/163226/first-fossil-evidence-that-velociraptors-hunted-in-packs

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor

Source 31 from the wikipedia article, explains how velociraptors used similar tactics as predatory birds, leaping on to the back of their prey and attack their quarry and eating it alive until it died from organ failure/blood loss.

Citations 27 and 28 provide evidence that the Deinonychus, a closely related species to the raptor, hunted in packs to take down prey much larger than them (links below to the two dinosaurs).  I will give that the pack hunting is a bit weak, as there is only a little evidence to suggest such behavior, and if that is not true then it would be difficult to say that a velociraptor could take anything that was terribly larger than it.  However, given the scenario given by OP, whether or not they work in groups is irrelevant as he's FIATing that they do, therefore, it seems plausible that they'd act like their cousins which have been shown to work together to take down larger prey.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenontosaurus

That said, while they are the size of large chickens, they have claws and have been postulated to be able to run at speeds up 60km/hr (or 40pmh) for short bursts and their hunting behavior is to leap onto the back of their prey and tear down at it.  If there is large grass in the area the marines are crossing, I'd say they'd be in trouble.

I remember sitting on my bed with my gun (gifted via of age brother in law), thinking about transitioning and how I was going to do it and how to afford it, how everyone would react and how bad it could go. I put the gun to my head a few times just to see what it would feel like, then I unloaded it and tried clicking it against my head with no ammunition. Then I put a round in, brought it up to my head and with shaky hands it fired parallel with my cheek and ear. Muzzle flash and residue went straight into my ear (permanent loss of hearing), the slide dug a big friction burn across my cheek.I dropped the gun immediately and balled up from the shock. I hopped up, put away the gun in the safe, and convinced my mom I had dropped a bunch of books making the sound. She bought it somehow, and I patched up the hole in the ceiling the next day.I haven't fired a gun since that night, but I did step up to the challenge and transitioned. I'm 21 now and full time.

Not really much you can do, but as far as street deals go I'd say it's fairly easy and safe there. The deal kind of runs itself, and they handle lots of English-speaking tourists. There also used to be some vehicular delivery services (so convenient!) as well as certain Turkish tea places where you could buy, but that was a long time ago and I wouldn't know about that any more, they've probably mostly been shut down.

Trends from the US have a tendency to swap over to Germany years later, let's hope the progress we've made on legalization arrives here some day.

Edit, again to be more specific (I should learn!): you can expect a bag of 4 to 5 grams to cost no more than 50€, which is already a lot; 40 is better. To identify &amp; approach a dealer, make eye contact with the first dealer-looking dude you see -- yes, at Görli he will probably be African or Portuguese and most definitely male -- assuming he's actually a dealer then he will mumble a greeting and then you can say hi how are you or some shit and he'll ask you what it is you want and you can take it from there hehe.

&gt;Penal Code (Sections 370-374) defines both littering and illegal dumping and defines violations as being punishable by an infraction or misdemeanor. On January 1, 2007, AB 1992 went into effect which expands the prohibition against illegal dumping to include private property and increased the minimum mandatory penalty from $100 to $250, and increased second and third offenses to a maximum mandatory penalty of $1,500 and $3,000 respectively. 

&gt;Section 373.3(f) states that the court may require, in addition to any fine imposed upon a conviction, that, as a condition of probation, a person remove or pay to remove any waste matter which the person dumped. 

&gt;Section 373.3 (h) defines the penalties for illegally dumping commercial quantities of waste which include imprisonment in a county jail for not more than six months and fines up to a maximum of $10,000.

Everyone was quickly available by text or email (people here seem less likely to use smartphones to schedule things quickly, too), so it wasn't like we were ever interrupting anyone's schedule or imposing on ""their time.""

To me, that awful back and forth trying to schedule something is much less respectful of people's time, ""Oh maybe we could meet Saturday? No? How about the fourth?"" Then the person replies, ""Not the fourth. Maybe the 11th? Let's play it by ear..."" and THEN THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT OFF AND ON FOR WEEKS. And every time they can't meet, they are basically saying, ""Something else sounds better than getting together with you, sorry, but let's keep trying..."" I actually have entire relationships here that consist of nothing but planning and then canceling events without ever actually meeting. I enjoyed none of that back and forth, and would have rather they just sent a text when they had a free hour.

I've been privileged enough to have friends respond in some wonderful ways. One friend said to me, ""I want to hug you and hold you and never let you go and fight off all of your demons. You ARE worth the world. Fuck the people who ever made you feel otherwise."" I wish everyone who has experienced such things had someone tell them such things. There are always going to be people who judge you for your past, who misunderstand you, who don't respond in a loving way. But there are good people out there. There are people who know what these issues do to people. There are people who will listen and be patient and love you irregardless of your past. It may not be easy to find such people and it may not be easy to share your story with how individuals have reacted to you in the past, but I do hope and believe that one day you will be able to do so.

Then, when I'm preparing for a charity ride (most are at least a metric century) I log an extra ride a week from 30-60 miles.  I'm not experiencing any knee or other pain.  I've had issues with this saddle since day one so I experimented with the position and nothing seems to help.  I was mostly concerned about a leather saddle and the way I profusely perspire.  I wasn't sure if that would damage it. I have AS so the eliminates and impact sports.  I do core exercises to help strengthen my core. The shop where I purchased my bike from is a specialized saler so I'm going to call them Tuesday and see if the do saddle fits.  Ill remeasure my sit bones later in mm.  Thanks again.  ","1377994239"

How is it important?  You have no say.  All candidates are the same, if you believe otherwise, you're a fucking idiot.

Also where you anwsers the things i wrote, try to think about what ""most"" and the fact that even if i recognize some to be racist, doesent mean i think they are on a big level or it might make me think they are not racist beyond any other belief system. 

Also, im sorry with the editing, im taking a while with the editing and underestimating how fast some people here respond. 

As it was explained i didnt think they excluded everything but white men from th first description. Just like mechanics dont necessarily exclude women althoguh there are fewer women who work with mechanical professions. Also social justice is not rational, its simply a nice thing to do. 

Also, i dont see how how not focusing on social justice makes it any less welcoming to say, black people. in fact by including these social jsutice things you are basicly saying ""oh, we got this new kid here, hes a SPECIAL kid you have to treat him nicely"".

 It's likely that, as with any technology, the cost will diminish over time and with economies of scale. The argument you might want to go for is: will _early_ access establish an overwhelming barrier?

 Second, it's unlikely that the customers of these genes would tolerate a Monsanto-ish policy over reproduction. If you're having your children enhanced by any way, you wouldn't want either sterility or a licensing mandate for reproduction to come with it. 

 Therefore, these ""super genes"" would soon be free and up for grabs the old fashioned way. *wink-wink*

&gt; Plus, with this level of genetic engineering you could probably engineer viri that lie dormant in people and kill them automatically the second they decide to rebel.

 This would happen anyway, and probably already has. In general, the defense to any technology are the prerequisites of that technology. In order to have the knowledge to create such a virus, there must be a level of widespread technology and education that would empower others to find a cure.

"Volvo","t5_2qr4g","If you're hitting ABS, you've reached the point where any more braking force will lock the tire. On pavement (even in the wet), the pulsing of the computer will be more efficient at keeping the brake point just above lock than your foot, unless you're a pro race driver with many years of experience. There are situations where hitting ABS is NOT doing it wrong - emergency braking and track driving, where there isn't snow/deep mud/deep sand/unpaved road. 

Think about what you're saying. If you can get the tire to right before lock/into ABS WITHOUT the big brakes, having a bigger rotor/caliper will do nothing for you. You're already at the locking point. Adding more force will just lock the tire. 

The point of bigger-than-stock brakes is to manage heat, not reduce stopping distances. That's the job of the friction between the tire and the road.

From the perspective of someone who nearly died, and spent a month in the hospital a couple years ago, my family visited every day sometimes for half an hour sometimes for a couple, but they didn't feel the need to be there every second nor did I feel the desire for that. And I'm VERY close with my family. 

You just really don't *need* constant contact in that situation, the person who is being treated has a lot they are going through and it's exhausting; there are a lot of treatments that need to be done, and its nice to have quiet solitude time to reflect on the trauma of the illness. You can show your support without being there, and btw seems like it's for her own benefit, not her husband's.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","First of all (no surprise) there are no gore effects. Doesn´t matter if you shoot someone with a pistol or a gatling laser, it looks all the same. I don´t depend on gore but it´s animated pretty cool in Fallout so it´s a shame.

Worse is there are grammatical errors. For example the status window that normally says ""You missed"" is saying ""Du verfehlt"". That is pretty painfull to read. It´s difficult to compare but I would say it´s like saying ""you wrong"" instead of ""you are wrong"".

The greatest howler is that there are no children in the German version. If you don´t know Fallout 1 and 2: Yes, there are children and it´s possible to kill them but of course you will get the reputation as a [childkiller](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Childkiller) and every NPC in the game is going to hate you and bounty hunters will go after you. But the reason why removing children from the games is so bad: There are some quests that require interaction with kids so of course you can´t solve them. For example: [In Modoc is a trader called Balthas. He asks you to find his lost son Jonny. In the end you will find him alive and well in the tunnels of the Slags beneath the ghost farm. Well, not in the German version since there are no children and it´s impossible to complete the quest.](/spoiler)","1377994259"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Again we are in agreement that mining is indeed the ideal form of distribution. With that said we have a particular application here that is built on the existing Bitcoin blockchain and not an alternative blockchain, thus mining is not an option open to us. 

Therefore the question becomes what is the best non-mining option? There are plenty of potential answers (some better than others), random distribution, give aways, distribution for tech development or business development. I think J.R. sincerely believes that this mixed approach of offering them Kickstarter style to those that support the features + a small pool for tech dev and bus dev purposes is a logical solution. And I agree with that conclusion. 

As to the scam issue again I'd say that someone has to benefit from a scam for it to make sense. Well here is a guy (J.R.) that put up a $100K plus of his own BTC because he believes in this effort. As has been pointed out below he isn't going to get back those dollars back as a salary, but instead those BTC will go to developers and so I'm not sure how he is benefiting unless he sincerely believes the project will have utility. 

And your point is well taken. If the market decides there isn't utility in the project than the funds put to this purpose will not generate a great outcome. 

I'll be sure and work to see these funds are spent transparently and cash efficiently, because yes you can count me among the people who supports this effort.

Jack and Frankie are friends. They play DayZ together quite often. Jack's job is basically Youtube and BF while Frankie's isn't. Also, Frankie is the reason I made my gaming PC. Watching his DayZ videos made me want to play as well so I made one.

Lvl and Matimi0 are friends and have this series called ""Double Vision"" where the POV switches between the two when they play. Matimi0 also does weapon challenge videos where his subscribers recommend a class setup to use and he does. Lvl on the other hand is more about teaching others how to get better.

WovnHD's video are more funny than anything else. Good quick laugh.

Darkdesignbetrayed is a M98B god.

Also, LvlCap, Matimi0, Jack, Mongol, and Frankie take part in a ""Squad Up"" series where a bunch of these Youtube BF3 commentators play on a single squad. Other players join them as well. LvlCap and Matimi0 I'd say are the main.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","And a couple from Ambrose Bierce


POLITICIAN, n.
An eel in the fundamental mud upon which the superstructure of organized society is reared. When we wriggles he mistakes the agitation of his tail for the trembling of the edifice. As compared with the statesman, he suffers the disadvantage of being alive.

POLITICS, n.
A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage.

OPPOSITION, n.
In politics the party that prevents the Government from running amuck by hamstringing it.
The King of Ghargaroo, who had been abroad to study the science of government, appointed one hundred of his fattest subjects as members of a parliament to make laws for the collection of revenue. Forty of these he named the Party of Opposition and had his Prime Minister carefully instruct them in their duty of opposing every royal measure. Nevertheless, the first one that was submitted passed unanimously. Greatly displeased, the King vetoed it, informing the Opposition that if they did that again they would pay for their obstinacy with their heads. The entire forty promptly disemboweled themselves.

""What shall we do now?"" the King asked. ""Liberal institutions cannot be maintained without a party of Opposition.""

""Splendor of the universe,"" replied the Prime Minister, ""it is true these dogs of darkness have no longer their credentials, but all is not lost. Leave the matter to this worm of the dust.""

So the Minister had the bodies of his Majesty's Opposition embalmed and stuffed with straw, put back into the seats of power and nailed there. Forty votes were recorded against every bill and the nation prospered. But one day a bill imposing a tax on warts was defeated -- the members of the Government party had not been nailed to their seats! This so enraged the King that the Prime Minister was put to death, the parliament was dissolved with a battery of artillery, and government of the people, by the people, for the people perished from Ghargaroo.

The Nacirema are a tribe of people who supposedly live in North America and have all these crazy rituals. After discussing the article with students, you reveal that Nacirema is ""American"" spelled backwards, and the article was actually written about American culture. It's a cool way to introduce cultural relativism, and I think it gives students insight into what cultural relativism means that they otherwise wouldn't have.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","First, while I agree that MOST will probably behave as you dictate, not all will. I actually have seem a tumblr blog that is basically just an MRA but identifies as a feminist as well and he basically uses the feminist tag to say, ""You can't hate on me or say I'm against women's rights, I'm a feminist! Now about all that hating on men you're doing..."" While I do think this is uncommon of some who identifies as a feminist at all (as I'm pretty sure most who believe in men's rights truly prefer to use more 'neutral' terms like egalitarian or such, also not saying most people who identify as feminists are man-haters but few who identify as feminists will stand up against feminism for men). I have also actually seen people believe in a more 'dictionary' patriarchy than the more 'feminist' patriarchy, basically the belief the power is held mainly by men rather than the belief that men hold the power AND use it to oppress women, I don't like discussions of patriarchy because it's highly subjective since there's a 'social' definition of which was defined by feminism that basically by a penis I beat women I see in the street, which came to be because of the technical definition that first existed that was more observational about who held power rather than suggesting anyone USED it inappropriately. As well then you also get some beliefs about patriarchy and the individual power a homeless may have that congresswomen don't and just..... Patriarchy is defined very differently by a whole assortment of different groups, effectively reducing the use of the word patriarchy to expressing thoughts ranging from ""All presidents thus far have been men"" to ""There is a war on women, sons strangle mothers, and brothers rape sisters"", and it's such an emotionally charged term, I just have hearing it mentioned due to how..... undefined it has become.

Sorry just sorta rambling and stating thoughts as I read through your opening post as you make quite a lot of presumptions about the average feminist. I'm not saying they're wrong, but I do not believe that a large portion of feminists (ones whom are in/just got out of school, talking about high-school here since gender studies classes.....) are necessarily as..... 'charged' as a radical feminist who'll try to slit your throat for not bowing before her breasts.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I said transportation energy. The liquid fuel economic infrastructure (in the transportation of goods sense, which is a fundamental backbone of economy) in many ways predates modern electrical infrastructure. We have close to 1,000,000,000 internal combustion engines in the world. And we have absolutely no way to supplement or fix the incoming liquid fuels shortages. Like I said, 98% of liquid fuels are petroleum-based. And not only the fuels. All the plastics, composites, fertilizers, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, etc. They're all made from petroleum.

Hell, one *mile* of a typical municipal road can take 100,000 gallons of oil to pave. 

Electricity, no matter where it comes from, is a considerably small part of the economy. Beyond powering information systems, household life, utilities, and some components of production-side infrastructure, a vast swathe of the economy is hopelessly reliant on liquid petroleum fuels, and is in no way geared to switch any time soon. 

Without a continuous supply of *cheap* petroleum (there will always be petroleum, we have tons of it.. the problem is we are running out of the cheap stuff, and alarmingly fast), the economy will simply fail.

Edit: And before we go all ""Tesla"", EV's, etc., will save the world!"". They won't. And they were never meant to. Tesla's are luxury vehicles, and the batteries alone cost upwards of 10,000-20,000 dollars. Just imagine what they would cost for the diesels/barges/etc that use many dozens/hundreds/thousands of gallons of fuel in one sitting.

Barring some miracle of science that creates an energy storage medium comparable to liquid fuels (which won't happen), I think we're in a bit of a pickle. One barrel of oil contains as much usable energy as 11 1/3 years of an average human male's labor output (equivalent to 1700 kwh). And we use close to 80 million *per day*.","1377994284"

"vita","t5_2sjmv","I honestly don't have an issue with the turn-based combat; I'm a huge JRPG fan so that style of combat comes with the territory. It's mostly the snowbally combat, your access to income, and the dungeon crawler-esque way the game handles it's dungeons IMO. 

One Mores give you incentive for manipulating an enemy's weakness, however there's no efficient way to maintain your MP throughout a dungeon once you're there. You can constantly hit enemy weaknesses, however you'll end up burning through your MP before you get to the end of the dungeon (or even halfway through it, tbh). This would not be an issue except for 2 reasons:

1) Things in this game cost way too much money. Everything that would give you longevity in a dungeon (equipment upgrades, recovery items, the Fox) cannot be effectively replenished inside said dungeon and/or they're freakishly expensive. You don't get much money or usable items from combat, so I found myself leaving constantly to heal and only using the Fox's horribly overpriced healing as a last resort (like ""if I leave this dungeon to heal, it's Game Over""). 

2) Auto-attacks are REALLY bad in this game. If you run out of MP, your efficiency in combat tanks. Hard. Even Strength heavy characters inflict marginally more damage with auto-attacks, and they're far less efficient because they can't consistently proc crits (meaning they can't effectively use One Mores).

Both of these factors create a situation where you have to keep starting and stopping a dungeon multiple times, and for people with an aversion to grinding, it's gets old fast. ","1377994285"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","This is an easy fix, but takes a bit of time. Follow as described to be effective.

If you have AVG antivirus I suggest you uninstall it..I have another free antivirus program listed at the end of fix for you to download. To properly uninstall AVG follow this link for the AVG removal tool.

http://www.avg.com/ww-en/faq.num-5172

Same goes for Norton Antivirus..

http://www.wikihow.com/Uninstall-Norton-Internet-Security

Now lets fix your computer...
 
1. Run the ""junk removal tool"" from bleeping computers (Click on the ""Blue"" Download Now Button)
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/junkware-removal-tool/
Takes about 20 minutes to complete the scan

2. Run Combofix from bleeping computers (Click on the ""Blue"" Download Now Button)
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/combofix/
Counts to 50 and kills anything that moves….don't use the computer during this scan.

3. Reboot computer when Combofix is completed.

4. Go to start...control panel...internet options
click on the ""advanced tab"" and select ""reset"" at the bottom...then while still in internet options click on the ""programs"" tab and select ""manage add-ons""... ""disable"" anything on the list that seems odd...then on the left side of the manage add-ons window you will see Show: with All Add-ons listed...select the down arrow and click on ""Run Without Permissions"" and disable the same items listed. now you can open your browser and it should be working normal again.

Then download java and flash again..here are the links...

http://java.com/en/

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/

5. Download these 3 programs and run them on full.
Malwarebytes (Click the Green ""Download Now"" button) http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?tag=main;pop

Ccleaner (Click the Green ""Download Now"" button)

Advanced System care (Click the Green ""Download Now"" button)
http://download.cnet.com/Advanced-SystemCare/3000-2086_4-10407614.html?tag=main;pop
Caution on this download, decline the 2 prompt offers of spigot and toolbar.

Run only the free versions of the programs mentioned in #5.

6: With the above mentioned Ccleaner, click on the ""Tool"" icon and select Startup...now click on each tab above and disable anything you don't want running.

7.  You can now uninstall all the programs I suggested you install, but keep ""Advanced System Care"" and run it on Expert Mode once a week to keep your system clean. Note never download the 2 fixes they suggest. 

8. Finally clean out your startup menu (hogs the ram) 
.if you have XP click Run and type this in the window (if you have vista or 7 type this into the search window directly above the Start)  MSCONFIG   then select the start-up tap and uncheck anything to do with programs you don't want...then click on the Processes tab  … put a check-mark at the bottom beside ""hide windows processes"" then uncheck anything to do with the programs and select OK...system will want to re-boot...re-boot and the problem will go away.

After uninstalling your anti-virus program install Microsoft Security Essentials (or Activate Defender on Windows 8)

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows/security-essentials-download



Now run Microsoft Essentials in full and you will be back to normal surfing again.

However, I'd like to point out that your assumptions of atheists/agnostics are not very informed and I feel betray a certain amount of close-mindedness on your part. 

Let alone the assumption that atheism is a result of teenagers trying to rebel/establish their identities. Adolescents have always been around, growing up and rebelling as they like to do, but secularization is a very modern thing. 

Additionally, you've stated two things which don't seem to me to match up. Could you explain? 

&gt; So, as you can see, we've been in kali yuga a long time. (Since ~3000 BC!)

But: 

~The second begins to see some ""darkness"" enter into the world. People are no longer governed by God, but by kings and emperors. Our works and understanding of the world begin to become increasingly perverted.

I might be remembering my history wrong, but I thought that in 3000 BC, there were only a small scattering of civilizations complex enough to even have kings or emperors (if they could really be considered that)...I think the first monarchs were only in ~3100 BC or thereabouts.

So how did people start turning from ""God"" to kings and emperors, two ages before these were even starting to exist? Am I getting my history wrong, or does this belief system you've explained reject archaeological and historical records?

Nevermind that the year you mark as the beginning of a decline, not just in spiritual but in moral and social terms, was around the time civilizations began to rise and become stable.

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","The first point can be argued to death. I'd argue that people want the game to feel like Counterstrike, as it doesn't seem right. It's not always that people want the game to feel like 1.6, it's that they want it to feel like CS. If they wanted to make something similar but not, you didn't have to attach the franchise tag to it. There was a lot of hype to the players in the alpha, and more so in the Beta. There was a lot of good changes, but it kinda went down. 

But regardless of that, the _se maps made changes that were good for competitive play. And that's not always good for casual play. But that's ok, they're two different monsters. 

---

I don't see how that would work. Competitive CS has, as a whole, survived quite a deal without too much interaction with the developers. It's cool that they're trying to make it user-friendly, but I hate touching MM even with a 10 yard stick. I much prefer to 10man on a 128tick server. 

Even then, if the devs make their maps better, competitive will always use many maps that are built by the competitive player database. Look at the popularity of maps that aren't made by core CS games: Season, Cache, Mill, Tuscan, Contra, Fire... and there are more. These are all maps that have been in the competitive scene for relatively long and user-driven. 

If you want competitive MM to gear towards the competitive scene, there are a lot more important changes than just the map differences right now. Simply put, a lot of people comment that ""ohhhhh, Valve has made great changes to the maps"" but the fact is 
A) It comes a lot later on. And we're still waiting on gameplay fixes for a long time.
B) Map changes can come in the middle of season which is annoying and can be hard to deal with when you have a match later that night. 
C) There are still many changes/problems that need to be addressed in other maps. 

---

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see MM become a better service, but there are a ton of problems with it right now, and the map difference isn't a big enough problem right now. I miss the old days of IRC where you had the fun PUGs/Scrims/Ringer channels. _se maps really do have a lot of advantages and it's not really a big deal that they're not the same.

I.E: if the bases were 100 feet apart it'd take a runner longer to get to first but you'd also have more travel distance before a ball reaches a fielder's glove, and they'd need stonger arms to make difficult throws. 

Same with basestealing, it's already hard enough as it is of for a catcher to throw somebody out at second, add another 13 feet to that (if my math is correct) and it'll balance out the longer running distance.

As for combat itself the math is very straight forward, both sides add up their attack total and then kill off whatever opponent cards they can, the battle step is actually the quickest part of your turn to be honest. There is math involved but I'd not say it's 'mathy' because the  numbers you're dealing with are all relatively small and any combat modifiers are always addition-based.","1377994294"

"groupprojects","t5_2wfln","Originally posted by N.:

I love this and it is by far the clearest idea I have seen to assist Reddit projects. 

The heart of this project is PROCESS and PEOPLE. 


PEOPLE - we basically need more


1\. Frequently, a person with a genuinely good idea will not have the marketing and social media knowledge to gather the resources they need to develop the idea. If we create a marketing rapid response team, a group of people who can quickly throw up a twitter account, facebook account etc. and bring attention to the project, we can greatly assist in getting big ideas of the ground.


2\. Publish your plan in /r/TheoryofReddit - its solid and we can now get even more contributors as we have a more solid base.


3/. We need to get some people to go sub by sub, recruiting people with technical skills to /r/bigprojects. We dont need to be the biggest sub, with the most subscribers, but we do need a solid coterie of skilled people. 



PROCESS - guides are great


1/. Ideally the process guide should be written using a Google form/ Google  doc, to allow for better documents not hampered by the 1000 word limit and need for Markdown in Reddit and importantly including the ability to use images (esp graphs).  


2/.  Your process is solid, a chronological listing of SMART goals. As we get more experienced we can incrementally improve the structure.


3/. We need to add in some collaborative tools e.g. IRC, wikis/group discussion like PBWorks, Prop-ed, and maybe a Google Circle. Those 4 are pretty solid, easy to set up and free","1377994299"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I would start by explaining to her very simply that you'd like to talk to her about something that's important to you and that you need for her to listen to what you have to say and respect how you're feeling in order for your relationship to remain healthy. Be careful to avoid blaming her for everything, those conversations never go well. Commend her where she's been doing well and encourage her strong points. Tell her how proud you are of her. It may turn out that she's enjoyed getting into shape so much that she assumes you should too. She may be (wrongly) looking at it as something thay could relieve your stress, when really it's just creating more. Make sure that she knows that you're already feeling a lot of outside pressure and you don't need more from her right now, what you need is support. Maybe once this period of your life has past you can take a class together or something to demonstrate that it's not that you don't care about her *interests*.

I also wouldn't blame her for harmless flirting (as long as there's trust of course), although it's okay that you don't want to see it and I would say it's reasonable for you to ask her to show you more respect and not to blatantly do it in front of you. I believe that attention from members of the opposite sex (or whatever you're into) who are not your SO is an important thing. Harmless flirting is perfectly healthy, and in a way *necessary* to remembering the all important truth that you're together not because you don't have options, but because you *choose* to be. 

Basically I think you need to make it clear to her what you're feeling and don't let her belittle it or make it seem like you shouldn't feel that way. If she takes your relationship seriously, she'll take you seriously.

"MLPLounge","t5_2t403","[](/vsdrunk)I feel like it was more like Gearbox trying to cash in on their popularity form Borderlands with a movie IP. From what I've heard they didn't even develop the game and spend most of the money they got to make it on Borderlands 2. It's just a rushed, uninspired, and poorly constructed.

[](/sp)

[](/vsconcerned)There's some things in it that are just so bad I have to wonder who the hell decided to put them in. Like your HUD shakes every single time you move, and it makes me feel ill just looking at it. Your screen is also covered in film grain and scan lines, the film grain can be turned off at least, but the lines are always there. There's also constant glitches, like when one of my friends played it a scripted cut scene knocked him inside of a wall and he had to restart the mission. There was also one part where we had to wait for an AI guy to open a door, and he stood around for about five minutes before doing it. And if you're slightly behind someone when they hit a checkpoint, like behind them more than about five inches, you get teleported to the checkpoint and there's a terrible transition screen where your screen is filled with static.

The alien's AI is also just awful, all they do is walk at you while you shoot your gun that you aren't sure is actually doing anything at them. The guns feel about as effective as a wet noodle and have no sense of weight or impact at all; with the starting pulse rifle you actually get more recoil firing in bursts than holding down the trigger. And the only indication you're actually hitting something is a red X shows up around your cross-hare when you hit something. Then marines show up and by that point I just started running through the level instead of putting up with the combat.

Well it's not your paint/thinner combo because that's what I have been using for years. Just make sure you mix them up really well. Just a side note, I usually mix my Tamiya paints and alcohol at about 1:1 (which is 50%paint and 50% alcohol)

Thanks for the airbrush info. The Badger 100 is in fact a double action airbrush (that means you press down on the trigger to start the airflow and pulling back on the trigger allows/increases the amount of paint coming out).
One thing to check, make sure that little screw in front of the trigger is backed off (not touching the trigger in the resting position). It is used to set the minimum amount of paint released but you won't need it for now. Try practicing with the airbrush on some paper and you can see the effects of pulling farther and farther back on the trigger as you go. It seems like that may be what's causing the problem.

As for drying time, the Future dries really quickly in thin coats so about 20-30 minutes is plenty. I do 2-3 coats of future to make sure I got everything covered.

Just spend a little time practicing and you will get better at the technique. Airbrushing takes a little practice and finesse but it's not too complicated. It sounds like you are almost there. Good luck!","1377994300"

"OrganicFarming","t5_2vcoz","The following will explain it to you.  Though, you already know the facts as stated below.  I realize you are here to push your own agenda and to argue.  

""Bt in organic farming:

The bt bacteria, commercially available for organic farming is a preparation of weakened or most often dead bacteria, which is sprayed only in the case of high insect infestation and only onto the affected area.

The bacterium inside the spray contains the pro-form of the so called bt toxin. This is not an active component, it needs to be tailored (cut to size) to produce the active bt toxin, which is effective as a pesticide.

When the insect eats the dead bacterium, the toxin is partially digested in the insect gut by proteolytic (cutting) enzymes and converted to active bt toxin. This is actually a lectin which binds to the gut wall of the insects and this interferes with the digestion/absorption of food, thereby preventing growth, maturation, reproduction.

The actual bacterium, which is not eaten by any insects, degrades in the light/sun/rain pretty fast (less than a day). The chances of pests developing resistance to it are very low indeed, since all the pests which are exposed to the toxin are affected by it.

NOTE!  The  ACTIVE TOXIN can only be found IN THE GUT OF THE INSECT.

Bt bacteria has no harmful effect on the environment as far as we know.

As far as human safety is concerned, the bacterium is only ever present on the surface of the plant and, if there were any remaining bacteria on the crop when it is prepared for consumption, it can be easily washed off.

 There are several bt pro toxins produced by the different strains of bt bacteria. These active toxins are sequenced, patented and used by the different companies for their own GM bt-toxin transgenic crops.

Bt in GM crops:

The gene of one, or several of the active, trimmed toxin is transferred to the GM plant and will be synthesized in every single cell of the transgenic plant and the active toxin is being expressed by every cell, all the time. Therefore, the ACTIVE TOXIN IS IN EVERY PLANT CELL AND TISSUE, ALL THE TIME and cannot be washed off.

Pests are exposed to a low dose of the toxin in their environment all the time, which gives the best chances for developing resistance.

As far as safety is concerned, the active toxins are not easily degraded by gut enzymes and, since they are lectins, they all are very likely to bind to the wall of the mammalian/human gut.

The bt toxin is in the soil, in the plant, in the pollen, in the nectar -- in short, in every part of the plant which is used as human food or animal feed.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","This is a good starting point for discussion about cinematography, but it's important to note that comparing a film like Taxi Driver to The Producers on purely visual aesthetics might be a somewhat futile exercise, since one is a psychological drama about a mind in chaos (hence why New York is so centrally framed around Travis Bickle) while the other is a satire about the theater world (perhaps why the film has an inherent two-dimensionality to it).

A more important way to judge cinematography is how well the visuals compliment the actual content and ideas of the film (or the marriage between the syntactical structure with the semantic content of an image).

Having worked in the film industry for a while, it's also important to note how much of the visual grammar of a film will be pulled together as a result of preparation and responding to the circumstances of the day. Listen to Conrad Hall and Sam Mendes' commentary for American Beauty to hear how one artist simply just ""feels"" out a scene based on the script, location and lighting (Hall) versus another who intellectualizes every decision as implicitly chosen over a myriad of possibilities (Mendes), both reach the same place, but in a very different way.

"CriticalTheory","t5_2tmcb","Lots of philosophy. Foucault, for instance, was deeply influenced by Nietzsche, whose ""genealogical"" method runs through of a lot of Foucault's work. (Foucault even wrote an essay entitled ['Nietzsche, Genealogy, History'](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/CLAS/Departments/philosophy/Students/Documents/'Nietzsche,%20Genealogy,%20History'%20by%20Michel%20Foucault.pdf). Key works would be *Beyond Good and Evil*, *On the Genealogy of Morals*, and *The Gay Science*, although almost all of his work is relevant. An essay of his entitled 'On the Use and Abuse of History for Life,' in *Untimely Meditations*, is also very important. (Be careful, though: avoid *The Will to Power* until you're fairly well-versed in his thought; and *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* is wonderful to read but is kind of like BGE, GM, and GS all distilled into a partly satirical lyrical novel).

How far back do you want to go? Many of the theorists you mentioned were steeped in the philosophical tradition, and all of them are, in their own ways, working in, around, and against the legacy of Kant and the Enlightenment (as are most philosophers since Kant). Here the most important works are without a doubt *Critique of Pure Reason* and *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*. The *Prolegomena* is basically Kant's own ""Cliff's Notes"" for the *Critique of Pure Reason* and is a good alternative if you just want to familiarize yourself with the major ideas and arguments.

And even 2,400 years later, we're still responding to Plato. *The Republic* and *The Apology* are essential. 

And it's worth noting, a deeper understanding of Plato will contribute to a deeper understanding of Kant, both of those are practically required for understanding what Nietzsche's doing. Oh and in the early 20th century, Heidegger took them up and tried to break their philosophical legacy apart (in *Being and Time*, his attempt to demolish what he termed 'the metaphysics of presence'). Heidegger is also hugely influential. (Alain Badiou names him 'the last universally regarded philosopher.') 

One final thinker who was important to a lot of those critical thinkers was Georges Bataille. *The Accursed Share* is probably his most relevant work, in which he develops a notion of what he calls ""general economy"" to counter more ""restricted"" theories.

I went philosophy heavy on this, because that's what I know most, but there are obviously many others who would be more relevant to sociological/economic issues. Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Pierre Bourdieu come to mind, but I'll leave that up to more knowledgeable commenters. ","1377994309"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; As far as I know (and correct me if I'm wrong), but I didn't hear ANY reaction from Assad in the media! Isn't that so strange?! Surely if he did this, he'd use the media for his own ends (either to say it was the rebels, or perhaps himself, and then append that fact with his propaganda). NO, nothing. Nothing from Assad.

[His regime has officially responded and accused the rebels of conducting these attacks, among others.](http://www.jpost.com/Syria-Crisis/Syrian-government-claims-to-find-chemical-agents-in-rebel-tunnel-324110)

I'll go ahead and try to provide some reasons I think Assad is behind it, in somewhat random order.

- [The regime denied UN inspectors access to the sites where chemical weapons were allegedly used for days before allowing them to visit, despite that one of the three sites was within walking distance of the hotel inspectors were staying in.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/22/us-syria-crisis-chemical-analysis-idUSBRE97L10020130822)

- I'm not saying Assad green-lighted this particular attack.  This may have been conducted without his explicit knowledge--although I think he allowed his regime to use chemical weapons before this.

- If he did give the order for this specific attack, I think the attack was likely more destructive than the regime intended.  I believe that [chemical weapons have been used in Syria by the regime for months](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war#Chemical_weapons).  They 'crossed the red line' long ago, but they were doing it on a small enough scale that it was preposterous for the international community to allow 95,000 people to die but then get involved over 8 people dying in a chemical weapons strike.

So why cross the red line at all?  Why push it?  There are a number of reasons:

- Syria has the world's third largest stock pile of chemical weapons.  It's a real chunk of their inventory.  It disadvantages them when waging war to not use some of their weapons...and if they continued to use them on a small scale, it likely would have gone unpunished.

- Using them on a small scale serves to demoralize the opposition.  It shows them that they can 'cross the red line', and still no one is going to step in and stop the regime.

- Iran and the IRGC are present in Syria.  They may have coerced or encouraged the use of chemical weapons as a slight (drawing a blank for a better word) to the United States.

- Even with this large attack where ups of 1,300 people are suspected dead, international intervention is far from a sure thing.  Syria will always have China and Russia to veto a resolution in the UNSC.  This means the cowboy United States and friends are engaging in their own activity again--it reminds the world of Iraq and Afghanistan.  This hurts the image of the US worldwide, works well for China, Russia, Iran.  And now it even seems as if our allies--NATO, UK, will not be joining us on this venture.  There may be no strike at all in response to this attack.  Now the US loses credibility.

- This raises the bar for further intervention.  Imagine in three weeks, we haven't intervened, things have cooled down and 45 people are killed in a suspected chemical attack.  Once again each side blames the other--the truth is not 100% clear.  Is the United States going to intervene now?

- Even if the US does intervene, the only serious option they are considering is cruise missile strikes--and these aren't even aimed at debilitating the regime.  The efficacy of these potential attacks has already been called into question.  If these attacks occur and aren't effective, does that reflect well on the United States?  Again, this works well for Iran.

- Even this heated domestic debate in the US isn't undesirable for Iran.  The people are sick of US interventionism and are weary from Iraq and Afghanistan.  This reminds the people that the US is willing to act unilaterally, is the bully in the world, etc.

- If there's one thing Israel and the US are paying attention to in Syria, it's who has control of the chem. weapons.  There were no reports from either intelligence community that the gov't had lost the weapons.

- Along with the above reason, this does little for you if you don't trust the USG, but: the claimed evidence of satellite photos, comms, etc.

- This is not Iraq.  Four percent of Americans are for sending troops to Syria.  If Obama did participate in some sort of ploy to get us involved, he risks impeachment, his legacy.  If we end up in ANY kind of drawn out conflict, he may be the least popular president, ever.  It doesn't serve him well.

All in all, the regime had the capability to conduct the attacks, they weren't forthcoming with allowing investigators access, and although the motive isn't murky, I don't think we can assume that all actors are being completely rational during an all out civil war.

Btw, I don't know your style, (and this certainly isn't a negative) but a lot of people seem to come here so they can feel comfortable living traditionally while looking non-traditional with tattoos, piercings, multi-colored hair, costumes during the day, goth, whatever - on any given day I'll see at least three people with full sleeves, drag, or a facial tattoo on my way to work (I live in Capitol Hill). So you can't stare or otherwise judge anyone's outfit, or even ask ""what's your tattoo."" They don't really have an alternative lifestyle. Seattle's kind of where inked and earlobe stretched types come when they want to settle down. 

Other places seem more conservative in their style. A friend in DC was horrified that a date he met online showed up with sleeves, and I was shocked that he thought it was a negative. ","1377994315"

Thee is also incredible bias in favour of the Rabbitohs.

When its not about that, its about what fits the aesthetics and the game.

Just doesn't suit this game. It isn't as popular in the era it is set in either and is not what people would associate Los Angeles with.

Like someone already pointed out, cruising down grove street and in the suburbs to Fly Lo FM suits the game.

Listening to Rammstien doesn't.

EDIT: I realize I sort of come off here as someone who has it out for Metal, but its purely an example and I used it as most people seem to be complaining that there isn't any in the game. I mean other examples your could use is Trance or even Dubstep, sure Dubstep is probably relevant for the era. But does it fit? No.

And just for the record I do like Rammstien, and some other stuff, but I wouldn't call myself a Metal fan.","1377994318"

This is why you should cook (heat) your tincture thoroughly to decarboxylate the THCa or CBDa to turn them into THC or CBD. However, you won't turn THCa into CBD or CBDa into THC, so your tincture will pretty much resemble the bud from which it was made.

TL;DR Tincture will retain characteristics of bud. Heat thoroughly before using.

I was still learning how to use scooters brakes, instead of stopping with my feet.So we end up turning on to a street with a HUGE hill, but more than half way down, there was a fairly large crack (probably 4 to 6 inches). My brother and my sister both go down, trail braking, and go over this crack perfectly fine. Well since I was continually told to use the scooter brake, I FINALLY used it. That moment when I realized I was still accelerating is still the scariest moment I ever expirenced....   
    
So when I hit the crack, I sorta nearly flipped, my helmet shattered (yes, shattered) and I didn't black out (unfortunately). I still have kindergarden pictures of me with blotches that look like chocolate on my face...

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","Maybe. But as a productive member of society, I don't want to deal with this shit. The homeless people here are brash. Sure they won't attack you, but they can be menacing. And when they shit in your doorway, that is unacceptable.

In this regard, the West coast is unparalleled. In NY, you would never see anything like what you have here. My Dad, who lives in NY, made comments about the homeless here and how he didn't feel safe walking back to his hotel. And I can understand why.

Last year, I was walking downtown -- alone, at night -- and a big black guy crossed the street over to me and pretty much told me to buy weed off him. I didn't want to. So he asked for $5. I said no, trying to keep walking, but he was cutting me off until I couldn't just pass him, begging me for money. He didn't outright mug me, but I couldn't get away until I gave the guy some money.

Anyway, maybe my experience is unique. But I would never walk downtown alone at night ever again.

I've been to a lot of cities, some with some real problems, much worse than anything in the US. And I've never been harassed on such a consistent basis as I am here in Seattle. I don't want to deal with it, and I shouldn't have to. So sure, there are problems everywhere. But they shouldn't be as fucking blatant as they are here.","1377994341"

Same goes for cloth... I got 20'x4' for $30.  Basically I've got more in beer than materials for this project.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I don't think that the reason the formula works can be explained enough in ELI5, but as for how one would arrive to it, I imagine he could draw a circle then inscribe it with a square that has the same diameter. So he would try to establish a relationship between  the area of the rectangle (D*D) with the area of the circle,   using D, and expecting it to also involve some kind of squaring by roughly seeing that if you double the diameter the circle's area quadrables

So he'd take small pieces of paper or something and arrange them vaguely uniformly and try to see the ratio of those falling inside the circle vs inside the whole square. That ratio would close in to a number X (which will have to be pi/4) and then assuming that  the circle's area will use a square of the diameter he would check using the pieces, or some other more rigorous mathematical way, the assumption that the area is X*D*D, and finally realize that this is equivalent to X'*R*R (X'=Pi).

You would need hundreds of jumps to have enough experience for something like that to even start resembling safety, for a person without BASE jumping experience and the ability to track away from the wall it would basically be a death sentence anyway. So I imagine for him it's better for falling to just not be an option. Not to mention it just isn't feasible on a lot of the climbs he free solos.

The more important effect is Earth's tilt. The Moon stabilizes our axial tilt, which is currently at about 23.5˚. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the tilt can vary between about 22˚ and 24.3˚. Even a small tilt like that can (and has) cause ice ages. For comparison: Mars; Mars has ""moons,"" but they're just rocks, not large enough to be comparable to our Moon. Because it doesn't have a proper moon, Mars's tilt varies chaotically over millions of years, and can go from 0˚ to 90˚. (This is caused by the influence of the other planets.) If the Moon were to drift away, Earth would not have that stabilizer, and we would suffer the same chaotic motion.

"askseddit","t5_2s7xh","There are two different schools of thought. One - especially during day game, they say you should verbally declare your attraction. Also, some do this during night game &amp; have good results.

Two - Let Kino declare your attraction. You don't have to verbalize your attraction to a woman, let Kino do the talking, as she will know you are into her, without you saying a word.

Here is the key to this ambiguity - Either way works but you don't know which women will be more receptive to which method. In the end, it doesn't matter. What matters is that you are approaching, conversing, escalating kino to build attraction and trying to seal the deal. 

Regarding agenda, if you have specific fears or anxieties, then I would highly recommend that you set very specific goals for yourself. But I wouldn't set a conditional goal, such as taking a girl home.

For example, I have massive AA, so I can set a goal of ""approaching 10 women"" or whatever. Note, that the goal is not an outcome of the interaction, but rather, a start. And if any one of these 10 approaches leads to something successful, great, if it doesn't, oh well, moving on. The outcome of the approach is irrelevant; The approach is achieved simply by your own actions.

I would never set goals where you cannot control the outcome. Goals are about self-improvement and are achieved by you, and you alone. So getting women's phone numbers, kisses, dates, sex, etc. are all wonderful outcomes when you succeed at achieving your goals, but shouldn't be necessary to feel as though you accomplished something.

Analyze your fears, setbacks and the future achievements you wish to attain, then set goals that will help you meet these challenges.

A terrible child rapist, who has repented and accepted Christ will receive God's grace and be blissful for eternity, yet a good person, as good as possibly can be, but one that has not agreed with the philosophy, will suffer eternally?  What is just about this?  If the Christian God requires that one sole quality (acceptance of him as Christ) then it matters little what type of life you live.  If you argue that faith alone doesn't deliver and deeds are required, then how can a just God punish those that lack faith?  If that is the requirement for eternal bliss, then on principal, a good person should not accept it because good people will be suffering.  That is the core of many people's disagreement with modern Christian theology. A good God would not punish good people, an evil one would.

Back in 1995 at our local volunteer fire department, one of our then assistant fire chiefs (now a lieutenant with the Maryland State Police) was working on a ""project"" using a plasma cutters inside our engineering room.

We have a waste petroleum drum (55 gallon) that was about half full of old oil, gas, etc.  which is right beside the entrance to the room.   Well as luck would have it there were four other people in the room beside him.  I was standing outside the engineering room just standing there watching and leaning back on our one piece of fire apparatus when I saw some sparks fly about 15-20 feet from the area where he was using the Plasma Cutter.  In true ""Oh Shit"", I saw a very long Matrix like moment shortly before the drum exploded.  

Everyone inside of the room was uninjured, but me standing on the outsiide... Had 2nd &amp; 3rd degree injuries on my body (non life-threatening).  Was out of work for about a month.  

They took a picture of the fire apparatus I was standing against.  You could see a clear outline of exactly where I was standing against it.  The other part of the apparatus was covered in oil...

ME2 was so difficult at times (i played adept). Every enemy has protection. Like seriously, armored husks and abominations were the worst thing. But it made me really think strategically about my abilities and weapons and which squadmates would be best for which missions. The collector ship mission i actually had to restart because i ended up just taking the wrong squadmates with me and it just couldn't be done. That being said, it was also one of the most immensely satisfying games to finish on the hardest difficulty.

ME3 was actually pretty easy. Instead of every enemy having protection, they just do more damage and take less (you know, the standard RPG difficulty slider). So you don't have to be as strategic. There's also a ton more weapon and power variety, so you can get pretty creative. The biggest thing to pay attention to is your combo detonations. The hardest thing on insanity was Citadel DLC, which made me feel like i was playing mass effect 2 again because all the enemies were shielded.

And for your choice: Infiltrator will be okay for ME1 (just bring some biotics with lift with you, it makes things so much easier). Infiltrator will be really great for ME2, because you've got incinerate for armor and disruptor ammo for shields/synthetics. You can choose pretty much anything as a bonus power and be good to go, but energy drain is probably one of the best. Effective against barriers and recharges your shields (SO USEFUL).","1377994367"

It had just finished raining and my trucks windshield wipers were kind of crap so I probably shouldnt of been driving anyways. My ex pointed out this house to the left of me that had its own personal lake behind it. I looked over and behind me a little to get a look at it and when I turned back around the road just... stopped. I clipped a little sign with my mirror took it straight off slammed on the brakes and ahead of me was this giant mound of dirt. The only thing I could think of was dukes of hazard and that I was going to go flying... Instead We kinda plowed into it and ended up stuck teeter tottering on the top of the pile. Other than my mirror damage was minimal. It took out some of the plastic guard under my truck but that was it. We ended up having to get some guy in a bobcat  to tow us off it. ","1377994371"

If you dont sue all potential defendants in one lawsuit, your client can be forever barred from doing so after the case is over (even if you discover they actually did something really wrong). Attorneys often use the shotgun method of naming defendants to cover all the bases and let the jury decide later who is actually liable. Half the defendants in this lawsuit could be dismissed later on after discovery of facts and evidence, but at the outset its better to be safe than sorry and name everyone.

Its also possible the assembling person has a non-suit agreement in return for cooperating. Most attorneys look for who is the most helpful witness to get on their side. This guy may also not have any pockets to pick.","1377994372"

Your conscious mind works for you and so does your subconscious.  Both conscious and subconscious form one whole and unbroken mind. Train your mind well.  You shouldn't fear being aware of anything.

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","I have two suggestions.

1) Try it on first. I fell in love with a gown. It was perfect, beautiful, exactly what I wanted, and I ogled it for months before trying it on in a shop. Tried it on and hated it. Didn't sit on me like it did on the model or the hanger. The lady helping me brought out another gown that looked ok on the hanger, but was so perfect when I tried it on I cried. I never would have picked it from a picture though.

2) Look all you want, but don't buy until you're closer. I bought my dream dress well over a year before the wedding date (because it was so perfect!) In that time, I lost 30lbs and got pregnant, which has caused me to gain about 20lbs in weird places, upped my bra size by 2 cups, and I'll be breastfeeding at the time of the wedding, so who knows what my boobs will be doing. Long story short, my dress will need a *lot* of altering. You never know whats going to happen in a year+. I'd wait until you're closer, like 7-9 months.

If you do a search through r/yoga, I've seen people post about free online yoga instruction sources.  I believe yin yoga has a focus on long, deep stretches, so that might be good, although I don't have first hand experience with it.  I would strongly recommend yoga for the more general flexibility, mental, balance, and strengthening benefits, but, again, if you are dead set on being able to do the splits within a reasonable amount of time, you would be much better off just looking up a program for doing the splits.

Think about how many times during your life you'll buy a new guitar. It's not going to be every day, week or year. It's true that there's less choice, but all the major brands are available. I play a Gibson SG, a Les Paul, A Fender Strat and a Jaguar. It's not the end of the world.

You can flip a righty, but the nut will generally need to be replaced. On anything other than a classical you'll need the bridge to be redone for correct intonation. For electrics, the controls will get in your way. Jimi did OK like this though.

Borrow a right-handed guitar and see how you get on for a month.

The only soldier to go into that area, who is the one that killed the older man, reported that Khadr was unarmed, until a few weeks later when he changed his report stating that Khadr had a weapon with him, but the soldier isn't sure what it was.

So Khadr was held in prison for at minimum 4 years until while in Gitmo where he plead guilty and confessed because they told him he could go back to Canada if he did. He has since recanted that confession.

Also, he didn't just go there, he was taken to Afghanistan when he was 2 years old by his parents.

Ultimately what 'evidence' they have is misunderstood, or cherry picked on the basis that it supports their black and white view.

([Take for example the 'twin studies' articles linked in this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYMjXucTFaM), sadly ones behind a pay wall &gt;..&gt;)

And of course, any scientific thought that opposes these, or discredits them, or further goes against their belief is decried as pseudoscience, or them trying to oppress, or be hip with the world. You know, because your not truly hard core in your belief unless you've concocted some asinine tin hat theory that pegs the world as your antagonist.

Oh, and the insistence that because science hasn't found some kind of gay gene that it automatically defaults to it being a choice, as if that sort of argument makes loads of sense. If you can't prove somethings not an apple, it must be an apple right? Right? /s

"religion","t5_2qh39","Thank you . You are kind.  
According to some 'yes'. According to some others a very vehement 'no'.  The Quran says 2:111-112 (Pickthall translation) ""And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof (of what ye state) if ye are truthful."" ""Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.""
I find that religion can/tends-to divide and Divinely focused spirituality unites, so I have always found self-definition/association to be difficult in such matters.  In truth that is one of the greatest appeals in Islam.  It, from a Quranic view, tends to be quite inclusive and appreciative of diversity. 49:13 (Pickthall)""O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female, and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you, in the sight of Allah, is the best in conduct. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware."" and in 5:48 (Pickthall) ""... For each We have appointed a divine law and a traced-out way. Had Allah willed He could have made you one community. But that He may try you by that which He hath given you (He hath made you as ye are). So vie one with another in good works. Unto Allah ye will all return, and He will then inform you of that wherein ye differ.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This needs a tiny bit of back story.

So I was in the military and the regular way to address people was to yell ""OUT IN THE HALL"" and everybody would line up down the hallway. We had a platoon of about 70-120 guys and people had to do a bunch of shitty jobs every morning. Our platoon had two people appointed as ""Seniors"" who were in charge of keeping things running in an orderly fashion and delving out these shit jobs every morning. This didn't make you popular but if you got shit done it was easier on everybody.

Okay so I was one of the seniors, and one time this lazy asshat I hated dealing with needed something to do so I tasked him to cleaning out the showers. It's honestly one of the better jobs in my opinion. Anyways sure enough he fucks it up and does a piss poor job, during an inspection I get freaked on for how shitty the showers are and my job is to take the abuse and pass it on down the line to whoever actually fucked it up.

So I call everybody out in the hall to deliver the report on what to improve on and I tell this guy the showers looked like shit, you'd better do a good job on them tomorrow because he missed a lot of shit. He asks me if I can show him what he missed after we're done this briefing and I said sure.

Now I dismiss everybody and one of the two girls came up and wanted to know wtf was wrong with their shit as I mentioned it had a few things out of place. I start telling her and the shower guy bursts into the room and goes ""WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU WHY THE FUCK AREN'T YOU AT THE SHOWERS"" ... I told him I was just telling this girl what she missed and was on my way right after. He says ""I thought we had a fucking fight planned you piece of shit""

At which point in time I realize that I had accidentally agreed to go fucking brawl in the showers with this moron. I literally thought I would go in there and be like ""Here ya go buddy you missed a spot over here!"".

Anyways he grabs me by the shirt collar and slams me up against the end of one of the bunks and cocks his fist. He starts shouting shit at me while holding me there like ""I'm gonna fuck you up and make you fucking bleed you sorry piece of shit."" I'm sure he only made like two or three comments but I was tired of listening to it immediately so I just accepted my fate and the oncoming pain in my face, leaned forward looked him dead in the eyes and said ""Just fucking hit me you bitch"" as I prepared to fight back once he got in his first easy shot.

I clenched my jaw and prepared for impact, I remember hoping my arm could block a decent amount of his force and then my brain hit that confusion feeling I had suffered just a minute ago when he lets go of me and says ""You aren't that much fucking bigger than me, I'll fuck you the fuck up"" and walks out of the room.

For anybody curious I was about 160lbs at 6'2"" at the time. I wasn't bigger than anybody. Much less this guy who was muscular and although a tiny bit shorter than me much stronger. 

Anyways I walked right up and reported his ass. I had those shit heads threaten me on a daily basis and I certainly wasn't going to take any of their unstable bullshit. 

**TL;DR: Guy pins me up against the end of a bunk cause he's mad. Cocked fist and other hand firmly grasping my shirt collar while berating me. I lean in and tell him ""Just hit me you bitch"" and prepare for impact. 100% I'm fucked thought going through my head as I say it.**","1377994385"

&gt;They know that they are *they* and are distinct from others. If that is your reasoning then I can't see how you can continue to hold your position of superiority of kind, as all the evidence stands against you.

In no way am I saying that we are superior or inferior in kind. I'm saying that we are different in kind (just like the bee is different in kind to the eagle). 
A chimpanzee knows that he is *he* and not another, because it's an evident truth to him and others that see him, but he has absolutely no ability to ask himself *why* that is the case. He cannot begin to think of the question ""*Why would I be the animal that I am and not another animal, and out of all the chimps that make up my species why would I be me? How can I be I, distinct from all other chimps and even other animals?*""

It's also obvious that chimps and all kinds of other animals can have discussion, but I was talking about the *subject* of *our* discussion specifically. This whole time, I was talking specifically about *our* ability to have a discussion about metaphysical concepts, and not the fact that animals can communicate. Again, I thought that this was implied and I was mistaken in thinking that way. 
The animals and the behaviours that are mentioned in all these (fascinating) articles are not new to me, and speak in favour of their advanced level of intelligence. (The fact that even crows and magpies have the mental faculty to be self-aware is definitely amazing!) 
This knowledge however has very little to do with the *level* of intelligence on which *we* can discuss. I'm not implying that our ability to discuss on that level makes us better or worse than them. I can't see either how pointing out to that remarkable ability and working with that ability to answer existential questions is ""putting up a ridiculous wall between us and ever other living thing on the planet"". It's the opposite. That ability, that *fundamental difference*, this unusually acute sense of awareness, is *why* we can say and think that we are ""more alike than different"" (and I agree with you on that statement, even if you seem to think that I don't).  

(Morally and philosophically speaking, I could actually argue that we are in a much more delicate and somewhat unfortunate position compared to animals because of this peculiar awareness of ourselves and the world around us, and the moral responsability that is automatically attached to this awareness. That's another subject though.)

In fact, when I talk about consciousness I base it on the unknown mystery of life itself (I'll try and explain how and why later) and the ability to think metaphysically. Forms of Schizophrenia are proof of our very peculiar and 'fundamentally different' form of consciousness. A schizophrenic person (as broad as the term is) is attached to the reality that he chooses or is forced to believe in (by external phenomenae). It because he has *our* consciousness that he has the ability to believe whatever he believes in, and does so in absolute way (eg: a person who really believes that everyone is working for a spy agency and are after him; or a person who is convinced that he sees messages 'coming' from the universe on the license plate numbers of the the cars he is walking by). You don't see this particular type of 'hyper-aware' consciousness in any other creature. 

There is also the certain and logical evidence that at some point in time a creature woke up and was the first to ask the question ""Why am I me?"" or ""Why am I here?"" and that creature was man. He was the same man as you and me are men today. I'm not saying that at some point in history we were imbued with an ethereal thing called 'consciousness', I'm saying that our consciousness evolved to a particular point in time where that question was eventually asked. To claim that it was merely 'gradual' has nothing to do with the certainty that one day in our history, this one question was asked.  

When I say 'fundamentally different' it's not a difference in the sense that we are fundamentally different to other creatures 'in life' or in 'evolution', I'm pointing out a 'fundamental' difference in *our* thought process ; in the sense that we are the only creatures that have the ability to *think* of metaphysical and existential things. 
That's why when you come up with articles showing the differences between a dolphin's intelligence, a monkey's intelligence and then compare it to ours, it becomes irrelevant to the *metaphysical* discussion we're having precisely because we are the *only* species on this earth that can discuss on this level! 

That's why I'm surprised to read you say that I'm claiming that we are *superior* in **kind**. I'm saying that we are *different* in **kind** because of our ability to discuss and ask existential questions, which makes our species a rather a more mysterious and more mystical creature than all other creatures or animals (which in turn makes us realize how all other creatures are as mysterious and wonderful and special too). 
No other creature, no other animal that you can name or point at in an article is as 'mystical' as the human being. No other creature is aware of a *potential* meaning behind the mysteries that surround life or death, precisely because we are the only creature that can ponder on these things. To imply that animals can and will someday also ponder on these things is to approach the theory of evolution in a faulty way because it ultimately carries one away from that inherent awareness of one's *present* ability (as a result of evolution) to question existential things, thoughts or ideas. 

&gt;On the contrary, we are evolved beings, so evolution can be the **only** basis for understanding consciousness.

My answer to this would be : We are the *living beings* that we are, this inherent and evident truth can be the **only** basis on which we *could* begin to attempt understanding why we (and you and I, subjectively) have consciousness. 

I'll attempt to explain my position (in hope that you won't jump to the conclusion that my position is mere bias): 
Pondering over the theory of evolution in order to answer those existential questions is counter-productive. Using one's knowledge of evolution as a tool to try and get an answer to these very questions would most certainly imply that man, before Darwin had penned down his theory, was somehow more in the dark, or more ignorant, than the man of today. 
I'm convinced that it is the opposite. Answers to these existential questions are virtually impossible to be found this way precisely because individuals convince themselves that they understand and know things like the theory of evolution. It's precisely because they convince themselves that the **only** way of getting answers is by basing all meaning of life (=example of an existential question) on scientific result and knowledge, that they miss out on a most essential basis. This basis is the particular *mystery*, the wonder, that is automatically attached to one's life and life in general. 
It's with our inherent awareness of this basis (of life) that we can ultimately approach these existential questions in a subjective and logical way. That's why I wrote that basing oneself **only** on science is a trick. It's a trick because by *only* basing one's *search* for a meaning to life on the knowledge that science gives (which is predominantly objective and material), it blinds one from seeing and perceiving the life, an evident truth in itself, that is bombarded into us and into all kinds of beings and things that are around us. 


(To get back to **OP**'s post.) It's also trick because it's an implicit excuse for an individual to *not* search *for himself* these existential answers by pulling the 'science card' out. By doing so, by pulling this card out, an inevitable contradiction between the metaphysical world and the physical world appears. 
It's why people who approach existential questions with metaphysical evidence (which is predominantly subjective and of the 'spiritual world'. e.g : person 'x' doesn't believe in God and person 'y' believes in God), and people who approach these questions with physical evidence (which is predominantly objective and of the material world: e.g theory of evolution) are in total disagreement. 
I'll try and illustrate this by using a common example: One person would say ""I believe in God"" (*a subjective conviction based on subjective spiritual evidence*), and another person would say ""Well I'm waiting for evidence of His existence. Show me the evidence"" (*subjective conviction based on objective material evidence*) 
They are both 'right' to disagree, because they are both right in sticking to the subjective convictions that are based on the type of evidence they desire to follow. 

If a person says (and many people do say and suggest this) : ""Well there's no evidence in support of the existence of God to be found in the /scientific material world ; either we'll wait 100 years of 100000 years until we do get evidence, or it HAS to be that God doesn't exist."" ; 
it means that *no attention* can be paid to the metaphysical/'spiritual' world, precisely because of that's person *desire* to want to stick to material evidence. It's precisely because he deems any spiritual notion to be contrary to (*objective*) material evidence that all (*subjective*) evidence for the existence of a spiritual world is *irrelevant*, *insufficient* or *ignorant*. 


Understanding the material world around us is one thing, and it's for that reason that I love science and am in awe of the results it shows, but it certainly isn't everything.

He's explicitly a different character though. Due to the difference in childhood he's meant to be vastly less mature, more impulsive, less subtle, less hardworking, less focussed, more risk taking and FAR more dependent on his own natural skill.

Kirk Prime had many of these qualities, they were just moderated by control and maturity.

Also New Kirk is several years younger, and has had MANY fewer years in Starfleet, than Kirk Prime was/had at the opening of TOS.

Not disagreeing that the tone of the new films is intrinsically different however, or that you would be unlikely to see quiet, slow paced, subtle dialogue scenes.

That said, they had a lot of those in The Final Frontier, and they only contributed to it being excruciating and contrived.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","&gt;Maybe listing the ones that answer my original question would suffice.

Didn't the top comment answer your question? I was assuming you were looking for the fine details.

&gt;Not everyone's opinion is equal valid but you don't discuss that? Why not?

Derailing means going off course from the subject of discussion. Not everyone's opinion is valid because not everyone shares the same experiences. When wealthy make politicians say that they don't believe in abortion, that's not a valid opinion because wealthy male politicians generally don't understand the reasons people get abortions.

&gt;I'm trying to understand what 'emotional hurt' would be enough to justify discouragement. 

That depends on what *you* consider to be justifiable! Remember, you may be okay with rape jokes, I may not be. So I would discourage them while you wouldn't.

&gt;But just because someone's expression of sexuality makes me feel bad doesn't mean I should shame them for it or criticize them or try to discourage them does it? 

Yes it does. If someone is aroused by the idea of raping someone, that is not a sexual expression I would shame, criticize, and discourage because I consider that both physical and emotional hurt. If someone is aroused by the idea of engaging in sexual activity with young children, I would shame, criticize, and discourage that form of sexual expression because I consider acts of pedophilia physically and emotionally hurtful.

We as people *should* be criticizing almost everything, really. Historically, societal norms that were harmful but accepted did not undergo change until people criticized it. Today, we don't know exactly what's okay and what's not unless we take the time to analyze it and its impacts.","1377994395"

The estimated release date from that is a few months past, but it's where the grey area is because we've yet to get a publishing insider who can give a good estimate as to how long it'll take to print and distribute TWOW, let alone if an ideal release date will be taken into account to the point of a decent delay (this is a debatable point, as given the popularity of the series, there's more freedom, however I imagine after S4 ends is a nice time, as is somewhere closer to the fall, but, again, a publishing insider is needed there).

Ultimately though, most real evidence and numbers and facts point solidly to us getting TWOW before Christmas 2014.","1377994404"

How do you know they haven't *BEEN* in their shoes? I know I was in that situation for a long time. Not everyone ""trapped in poverty"" is the result of unfortunate circumstances outside their control. I was a stoner with a shitty job who tried just hard enough to get by, and as a result, I got by.

You get used to living like that, and slowly forget that there is any reason to strive for anything more. Looking back on that time in my life I don't see someone being kept down, I see someone who was interested in short term satisfaction no matter the cost.

___

Honestly if anything the reflex for compassion is diminished by being in that situation. It reminds me of when my parents would say my struggling in school was the result of me being bored because I ""wasn't being challenged enough"" or ""my teachers weren't motivating me.""

Sorry mom and dad but no. The reason I was ""struggling"" was because I didn't do my homework, I didn't study for tests, and fucked around during lectures. That is what struggling looks like. I wasn't a mental deficient that couldn't retain the information I was desperately trying to learn, *I wasn't learning it in the first place* because I was content to tread water.

It is absurd to pretend that every single person in a shitty situation is just being shat upon by the system. Very often it is people treading water hoping something drops into their lap.","1377994404"

Once I woke up from surgery though, that painful feeling in my stomach was gone, I woke up in massive pain from them slicing me open, but I was freaking hungry! Youll know what I'm talking about when you wake up. After you have your gallbladder out, avoid high fat foods as they cause tummy troubles..... also make sure you are always drinking enough water. And REST after your surgery, no doing laundry, no driving, nothing that is going to make you sweaty, nothing. Just rest. Seriously. And your surgeon should go over it with you afterwards, but if you have pain on either side of your lower back, they will show you where, go to the emergency room. They will explain it all. You will do fine, I'm telling you, once you wake up from that surgery after feeling shitty for so long you will feel amazing, I know I did. I started having stomach issues in September, like I would eat dinner, and then 6 hours later I would feel like shit and throw it up, nothing had digested. Then in January I had a night where I threw up every hour for about 12 hours straight, I went to the doctor because I thought I had the stomach flu, they gave me stomach relaxing pills and told me to rest..... was back 2 weeks later and the doctor suggested they do some tests on my gallbladder because I still wasn't able to keep food down. They scheduled me for surgery a week later, apparently mine was one point away from the need to take it out as an emergency, so I had the surgery done and I'm glad I listened to the doc. I can't believe I went so long without being able to actually digest food, I just thought the food was bad, but it was me.... I was bad on the inside. ","1377994405"

"WildStar","t5_2sqwc","If a fight is unbeatable on first attempt, it has artificial difficulty.  The fight no longer becomes about your skill, but when and if you hit the pitfalls that kill your entire raid and there is nothing you can do about it but rez up and try again.  If this is the case, then the only difference between a top end raider and a high skilled player is that a top end raider is willing to burn a bunch of time the second a patch hits falling into pitfalls.  Personally, burning a bunch of time because the game said I don't deserve to kill a boss until it kills me once is absolutely unappealing.

Imagine a raid boss like a level in a hard platformer like Super Meat Boy or something.  Sure if you take your time and are cautious you can probably beat every level on your first try, but the execution required alone probably means you are going to make a mistake and have to do it over again.  Death is punishment for making mistakes in your judgement or lack of reflexes, not because you don't know the fight.  Wiping and repeating the fight can make up for poor judgement and lack of reflexes because you will have experience under your belt.

Basically, what you are saying top end raiders want is trial-and-error gameplay, which is generally reviled by designers and players.  It is good for neither unskilled players nor skilled players, because it emphasizes time invested rather than personal and team capability.  Properly designed challenge allows for underskilled players to use trial-and-error to learn from their mistakes and use experience to make up for their skill, while skilled players can continue progressing or focus on optimizing their strategies.

It's revolting that it's as acceptable as it is to make disparaging comments and jokes about transgender people. People shouldn't be gawked at, shouldn't be treated as someone's bad bar story, and shouldn't have to fear for their safety if the wrong person clocks them. I think a lot of the problem is that the same people who sexualize/objectify transgenders also have to willfully ignore or be ignorant of the personal struggle that usually entails. There's also an element of shame for a lot of admirers, for others they are worried of ridicule. I don't think it's cool at all, and I cringe when I read a lot of the comments on this subreddit talking about people like they are prize stallions or something. I feel like I'm seeing positive depictions of transgendered individuals in the media increase since I was young at least, though still too often they are used as punchlines in comedies.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was eleven, I decided to be bad ass in front of my friends, and do a loop around the block in a motorcycle SUPER FAST!

Well, ended up entering a high speed wobble (at 25 mph).  For those of you who don't know, this is when a bike turns too fast, and nearly falls over, goes back up and the other way, nearly falls over, and basically wobbles a bunch as you overcompensate trying to right your terrible wrong.  For about ten seconds (probably a lot less, but it felt like that), I knew what was coming, and saw no way out of it.  The bike ended up flipping, and I went over the handlebar, and landed on my teeth.

Incredibly I survived with no broken anything except a mildly damaged thumb.

Aside from that, I had a super swollen lip, a bunch of scratches, and the tooth I landed on needed a root canal, and it may be dying so I'm getting internal bleaching to hopefully stop the discoloration, but I may need to get a crown sometime in the near future.  Considering it lasted a good five years after hitting pavement at 25mph, that's not that bad.","1377994414"

Dr. Web will find and kill just about anything, since Windows isn't running while it scans.  I've never really needed anything else.  

some people also suggest Microsoft Security Essentials.  and if I was to suggest anything else to use before Dr. Web, it would be Avast Antivirus.  but I haven't needed to use either of those in a long time.  Malwarebytes does a great job.  

also, have Adblock Plus installed on your browsers.  advertisements can carry viruses.  eliminating ads completely will help quite a bit.  I've also recently heard [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/) does the same thing as Adblock, and much more.  Adblock will be fine for most users.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Well, if Assad thinks that outsiders won't intervene (or won't act strongly enough to kick him out of power) and the rebels think they will, then he definitely has a motive.  If America and others don't interfere after that attack then he will have degraded the rebel's morale significantly by demonstrating that no one is coming to help them.  

Additionally, this will most strongly affect the secular rebels.  The Sunni rebels are already getting aid from groups like Al Qaeda.  The secularists are the ones who would have the most to gain from increased Western intervention.  By decreasing overall rebel morale, Assad gains.  By decreasing theirs specifically, spurring desertion and lower recruitment, he will increase the number of Islamist fighters relative to secularist ones.  The greater the proportion of Islamist groups in the rebellion, the less likely Western intervention is to occur in the future.  If Assad thinks the response won't come or will be anemic, he has a massive incentive to launch this kind of attack.  ","1377994418"

"answers","t5_2qkeh","I'm a research student in computer science, not a mathematician, but here are my thoughts.

1. Don't get your hopes up too high. The chances are fairly high that someone else has found this before you. It's not like laymen can't make advances in these things, but it's pretty rare.
2. Write a paper. This doesn't have to be an Official Research Paper For Publication In A Journal, but just a single clear document that lays out in full and complete detail exactly what this thing is, why it's useful, how it works, etc. Get to the point quickly, extra detail afterwards.
3. Publish this paper in a bunch of places. Post it on a blog, a website, sent it to some people. This is not how you get the thing known, it just means that the thing is undeniably out there on a particular date with your name attached to it. That's helpful for the next step
4. Find some mathematicians whose work seems close to what you're doing, and email the paper to them with a note saying ""I think I've got something here, can you have a quick read of this paper and let me know your thoughts?"". Expect either ""This is nonsense"",  ""This is a variation on what Smith and Johnson did in their 1956 paper"", or ""This isn't my field, you want an XYZ specialist, try so-and-so"".

If your work is actually novel and interesting, one or more of the mathematicians will become excited and want to get it published. They might offer to neaten up the paper and submit it with you as co-authors, or they might just give you advice about how and where to get it published. They might of course try to steal it, which is why step 3 is there.","1377994419"

Personally i got into it because i played basketball in college and recently stopped playing in europe and was looking for something to challenge my body.  My first piece of advice is to nail down technique perfectly on a lift first before trying to do any serious weight. Going back to correct form once you have already established bad habits is a waste of time and often times very hard. 

Once the form is out of the way, the next hurdle is mental preparation. Any program you undertake will be harder than whatever you are doing now, but you have to approach it as if you are competing against yourself. Something i do is look around the gym and make sure i can say that i am working harder than everyone there. 

I know that wasnt particularly exercise specific advice, but it sounds like you have the motivation to work hard so im sure you will be successful.

My biggest problem with continuity in Into Darkness is the fact that even when they find out he's Khan Noonien Singh no one really seems to react to the news.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The way my ears hear it, there are three distinct aspects of a perceived ""gay accent"" that may be heard:

1. An objective lisp, which is caused by the tongue hitting the teeth in a certain way
2. A feminine cadence
3. A higher freq

The reason for itemizing this is because I read the whole thread and there are two consensus's: born with accent, and picking it up (intentionally or not).  

All three of these speech variables can be changed (intentionally or subconsciously).  But how are they set?  The origin is different.  The origin of a lisp is physical.  The origin of a cadence is social.   I havent seen that pointed out.  

It sounds to me like the feminine cadence must be present to sound like a ""gay accent.""
A lisp without a feminine cadence just sounds like a lisp (not an ""accent"").  All kinds of people have lisps.
A high voice without the feminine cadence doesnt sound like a gay accent.  Even combined with a lisp it only sounds like mike tyson or an unskilled male actor playing a woman.
But the feminine cadence even by itself, even if used in a lower voice, some might call a gay accent.  (Though in many places it just sounds sophisticated.)  
When a feminine cadence is combined with either a lisp or a high voice (or both), it's more likely considered a ""gay accent.""

To the gay men who shun those with a ""gay accent,"" which aspect of the three (or other speech aspect) turns you off? (and why?  Is using a high voice a relatively low-skilled way of expressing ones self, because it's easy?)
To the one who pointed out that many women speak with a lisp which we dont usually notice, why do they (if a lisp is a physical trait)?

These aspects that make up the accent are very different:
- I think that picking up a feminine cadence takes a while and requires either practice or happens subconsciously (hard to start and stop).  
- Whereas speaking in a high voice is easy (to start or suppress).  
- Speaking with a lisp is easy to affect, but takes determination to stop.
- I've heard lots of little kids with lisps, who dont have them when they get a little older.  
- I've heard lots of little kids with high voices of course, who dont have them when they get a little older.  

TL;DR 
The origin of a lisp is physical.  The origin of a cadence is social.  So I dont think we can finally determine where a ""gay accent"" comes from, only where each part came from.","1377994422"

"RATS","t5_2qnh3","I prefer the ""I'll stick my hand in your cage and let you approach me at your own pace"" socialization. Just do it multiple times a day. Give them treats if they'll take it. Everyone has their own method. Leave a t-shirt that you've worn all day inside the cage too. Helps them get used to your scent.

If they're overweight a diet switch like you've done may help. Hold off on peanuts those are VERY fatty. Try using cheerios as treats. Much better option, especially for them being overweight. You can mix it up with apple/cinnamon cheerios, honey cheerios, standard, etc. IMO I would let them have access to oxbow 24/7 and keep giving them veggies and monitor their weight before you make any drastic changes.

Instead of fixing it properly, they changed my flight to a Lufthansa one instead, which *also* meant that I couldn't get to my connection in time, and they knew it.  I told them it wouldn't give me enough time but the people at the United counter told me to not worry and I'll make it just fine.  Total bullshit.  So when I get to DC and I miss my flight, United claims it isn't their fault and that Lufthansa should arrange my way home.  Lufthansa says its United's fault because they were the ones that switched my flight.  So I had to do some yelling at the United people, I was almost making a scene.  I finally got their head supervisor there and he gave me a hotel and food vouchers for the night and booked me a flight home in the morning.

Not that my family was poor but I was just a shit of a kid and did my fair share of things I'm not proud of. So I had this thing going on where I was a shoplifter and got caught.... By my dad. Now when I say I though I was going to die I really did in all honestly thought that I was going to die. My dad was a black belt super saiyan karate teacher who traveled the world doing his shit. I wouldn't doubt if he could kill a guy with one punch and on top of that he's Asian so he's strict as fuck. Anyways, drags me down to the local police station, my eyes are balling and I keep threatening him that ill leave and runaway which is useless once I thought about it. We get to the police station and he takes me in where there are two police officers standing talking about whatever cops talk about at 10 pm on a Wednesday. He makes me stand up straight and says something in his Asian accent that ill never forget, ""Take my son away, I never want to see him"" 
The two cops are just staring at him and If i can remember there faces it looks like the reaction you get when you see an old lady walking down the streets fully naked (yeah take that out of your   minds now) What's worse, my mom was right there when all this was happening and didn't say a word. I don't hate them nor do I ever resent my mom for not taking action and I eventually got my fathers trust back after years of hard work and awkward talks. The most oh fuck moment of that? When he saw what I had taken and looks at me straight in eye, not a word comes out of his mouth but a simple chuckle. Then again this is all based on memory of two people so I can't ever make the legitimacy of this anymore truer than I can vow to but nonetheless this is my most greatest oh fuck moment.

"blackops2","t5_2sqqn","&gt; the only ""luck"" in it is the initial no scope at the end.

Your misuse of the word initial aside, this statement right here contradicts your entire argument. If the entire trickshot is dependent on actually making the shot and getting a kill, (which it is) and the ""initial"" no scope at the end is luck, then the entire thing is heavily dependent on luck. 

&gt; Trickshotting is very complex

So apparently timing is very complex. Anyone who spends hours spinning in a circle should eventually be able to have some meager sense of timing. Even then, timing isn't that important (fire when you are sort of facing the target).  How about you stand in the crows nest on studio and aim your laser at a distinct point on the trailer (perhaps using a split screener as a target in a custom game) and see how many times you can hit it with hipfire from the same distance in the video. You don't even have to jump or spin or anything. Just stand there and try. Even with perfect timing (standing still directly pointed at your target) you will rarely get lucky enough to get the kill. You can even try hitting your target while aiming slightly to the left and right of them. You will still have just as much chance of hitting your split screener as long as he is within the confines of your large hipfire area.  Also your second point about someone hipfiring in mlg doesn't even remotely pertain to this argument. An automatic weapons hipfire spread may not be as accurate as when ADS but when you are firing 600 rpm at least and only need probably 3 shots to kill that's not really a problem.

&gt; They aren't ruining SnD games. If anything they are easy kills for the opposite team being last alive.

This is exactly why they are ruining SnD. If they are not even actually trying to win, then what is the point of the game? I could just go play combat training if I wanted to get free or easy kills.

I do not remember any, could you point me to some?

But the relevant point here is that a relation is a set, not a bag; SQL allows for bags; so, SQL is not relational.  On the other hand, Spanner forbids bags; thus, it (potentially) implements relations; therefore, it is relational — at least, closer to the relational model than SQL is.

If you're curious, the reason that 3.5mm (headphone jack) is divided into ""segments"" is so that it can provide stereo sound, whereas quarter inch (like a guitar cord) are mono. Stereo sound has two separate channels for left and right, which is why you'll hear one part of the song in one ear and another part in the other.

The tip of the jack carries the signal that will go to the left speaker/earbud/headphone, the middle segment carries the signal that goes right, and the bottom segment is ground, which completes the circuit.

You might have noticed that sound only comes out of one earbud if the jack isn't pushed all the way in, and that's why. Usually if you only put the jack in partway, only the left side can receive a signal (but it will confusingly be the signal intended for the right side!).

But being dead is far worse, (and less repairable), than having a broken bone.

Just as important is the fact that how likely it is that a tasering will be fatal is not something an officer can reasonably be expected to predict.  Nor can a suspect reduce that risk after he has been tasered by complying with officers.

By contrast, it's much easier to judge how likely it is that a suspect will be badly injured because it generally increases with the length and severity of the beating.  And of course a suspect can always become compliant and end all risk of further injury.

**************************
The point is simply that dismissing a tasering as a ""short term event"" is to be willfully blind to the dangers posed by tasers. 

And that's not even getting into the possibility that tasers will be used more often than truncheons would be because they're simply easier.  There's a distinct possibility that the taser option makes a talk-down less likely.","1377994439"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I haven't watched his whole argument -- I don't have time until much later tonight and I'd like to get back to you quickly -- but I can try to respond to what he seems to be getting at.

Basically, it sounds like he's saying that *in practice* the scientific and the religious are not the same people. This is true currently, but the exact opposite was true not so long ago. The father of modern genetics was a monk; an important contributor to the Big Bang theory was a Roman Catholic priest. I don't think it's fair to say that science and religion are incompatible based on this when historically quite the opposite has been true. If I find something else he says compelling, I'll edit this comment later, but for now I'm going to move on.

I want to point out now that I'm talking about religion in general, not a specific religion. Religious fundamentalists take the words in their religious texts literally, and conflicts with science do arise, so for many people their religion *is* incompatible with science. But this doesn't have to be the case. That's what many people misunderstand about religion; literalism is quite new and most religions have historically been quite flexible about science.

Essentially, theistic religions simply make the claim that the universe is governed by a sentient, omnipotent being.  This kind of claim is called unfalsifiable, which means there is no conceivable experiment which could objectively prove it to be incorrect. This is *not* incompatible with science. It is completely separate from science. It is not a valid scientific claim, but that does not automatically make it false. That's what many people misunderstand about science; absence of evidence is *not* evidence of absence, and not everything that is unscientific is automatically untrue.

The simple fact is that even though most scientists are atheists, there are still a significant number of scientists who find a way to make religion compatible with their study of the universe. A good example I can name is the YouTuber Destin from the channel SmarterEveryDay. I don't want to name anybody else, but I come from a college town in the Bible Belt where many professors are both scientists and ardently religious. The large majority of the world, in fact, is religious, and outside of America the majority accept scientific fact as well. Really, science and religion must be compatible, because people everywhere reconcile them every day.","1377994440"

I honestly wonder if the presence of military equipment in everyday communities is priming police officers to be more militaristic in their behavior by expecting citizens to behave as enemies instead of as peers. 

On the flip side I wonder if the presence of these also prime people who fear or distrust the police to be more drastic in their resistance to a militarized police force. 

I imagine if either of these are true it only makes neighborhoods more dangerous for citizens as well as police. ","1377994441"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Technically speaking, it was sponsored by Tom Davis (R-VA) and co-sponsored by 2 Democrats (i.e., Danny Davis (D-IL), Henry Waxman (D-CA)) and a 2nd Republican (John McHugh, R-NY).  Of the co-sponsors, Henry Waxman stands out like a sore thumb, given his political history.  The other Democrat is a no-name legislator that would be easy to corrupt.  I took the liberty of examining Davis' political contributions during the 2005-2006 campaign season and it shows [an unusual spike in individual contributions](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=2006&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00004884&amp;newMem=N).  There was a [similar spike in large individual contributions](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=2008&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00004884&amp;newMem=N) after this legislation was passed.  In the current cycle, his largest campaign contributors are PAC's.  You be the judge. 

Those who follow the legislative process recognize that co-sponsors do not play the same role as sponsors in championing any legislation.  More often than not, it's a symbolic role not one of legislative prominence.  The timing of this legislation is also not indicative of widespread Democratic support (i.e., a last ditch Republican legislative effort after losing Congressional power to Democrats in the 2006 midterm elections).

I don't dispute the presence of Democratic names on that legislation co-sponsor list, I'm merely challenging the role some portray them playing in that legislation.  If Democrats are as culpable for this ONGOING disaster as some believe, why don't we see them playing the same prominent role in opposing the repeal of this legislation as Congressional Conservatives?  This behavior disparity guts the political equivalency argument being made by some.

P.S.  I took the liberty of doing some further digging and came up with some interesting, [eye-opening insight](http://www.examiner.com/article/alec-and-kochs-behind-all-privitization-schemes-and-lies)  into John McHugh (R-NY) and Koch Brother/ALEC ties to this legislation.  Unsurprisingly, they all have ties to the very legislative provision which is inflicting the greatest financial harm on the Postal Service.

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","This month has been full of some incredible highs and some really terrible lows, but overall I am so happy to say that the month of August is ending on a wonderful note for me.  :]  These last 31 days have really been a roller coaster ride.  Earlier in the month I had to put my 19 year old cat, Mary, to sleep.  I got her when she was a kitten and she's the first pet I ever left, so it was absolutely devastating to me to have to do.  But I'm so grateful for the wonderful, long life that I was able to share with her.  She brightened my life in such an amazing way that I'm always going to treasure her memory.


Just last week my gran celebrated her 101st birthday!  I think that will forever remain my favorite memory of the month.  Even though gran was well into her 70s when I was born, she was basically a third parent to me.  Both my mom and dad worked full time outside of the home when I was growing up, and gran was always there to take care of me.  She's the one who taught me to read, who taught me patience and kindness and understanding, who listened to me and helped me with my homework.  She did absolutely everything for me.  I couldn't be any more grateful for another year spent with her in my life.  Even though she's 101 years old, she lives independently, and she's doing great!  For her birthday, we took her fishing.  It was so much fun.  We just spent the evening sitting on the lake, enjoying watching the fish bite, and having an amazing picnic.  Gran told stories about her childhood, and it was just so peaceful and beautiful.


Just yesterday I received word that my partner and I are going to be able to take a trip to London together in February.  I wasn't expecting it to truly work out, but hearing that it's actually going to happen... it's beyond words for me.  It really is.  I broke down and cried because I'm just so grateful for the opportunity I'm given to share time with a loved one, and to do so in such an incredible venue.  


So ultimately, this August has just been unbelievable.  It's been a time of appreciating a life spent with loved ones, and for that I couldn't be more grateful.


Thank you so much for hosting!  31 days for Augustus for the raffle, and if I am chosen I would truly love [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0785187863/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2R880Z7N8VV2&amp;coliid=I1KIIZC52INSCB) and [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/078515549X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2R880Z7N8VV2&amp;coliid=I1ZXAJ2EZLUJVP).

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Well first, there are a large number of things to read like this that aren't necessarily books:

* ""post mortem"" articles about specific projects. These are usually articles written by people on a team after they ship a project that sort of review what they've learned, etc. For example: [game post-mortems at gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/features/postmortem/).

* Many developers keep blogs as they work. For example, a guy named Phil Hassey wrote a small implementation of python called [tinypy](http://tinypy.org/), and there are numerous articles about his experience in the [tinypy category on his blog](http://www.philhassey.com/blog/category/tinypy/).

* See also /r/devblogs

As for books:

 - [Dreaming in Code](http://www.dreamingincode.com/) tells the story of an ambitious open source personal organizer and TODO-list manager called Chandler. (I haven't read this one.)

 - [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) has a bunch of articles along these lines about specific projects. (Free to read online)

There is also the whole genre of literate programming. For example, the following two books (both available online) contain the complete source code for their respective systems:

 - [Project Oberon (PDF)](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/books/ProjectOberon.pdf‎) contained both a a single-user graphical operating system, as well as a compiler for the programming language in which it was implemented. Source for each module is listed at the end of the relevant chapter.

 - [TEX: The Program (Google Drive)](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwO0SQND3WU5VFN1b2tQWm1XMEU/edit?usp=sharing) contains the full code of the typesetting system. Source and text are weaved together in the true ""literate"" style.

I'm sure there are plenty of other resources like these but these should keep you busy for a while. :)

"Games","t5_2qhwp","And the new resource, ""Meld"" is not going to change this.

What is going to happen is that on high difficulties, most of the time you are simply going to have to abandon the Meld. If it's difficult to obtain, and requires risking people, then it simply isn't worthwhile. Because of the focus on soldier leveling, those troops are not expendable. 

If a mission spawns where Meld can be obtained with minimal risk, then the player will capitalize on the opportunity, but otherwise the Ironman Impossible player is just going to ignore it.

The fundamental problem is with the way enemies spawn. Giving players an incentive to move quickly and take risks won't change the fact that the game's fundamental structure STRONGLY discourages that play style. To fix this, have all the enemies placed on the map at the start of the battle, and have all enemies able to move, shoot, surprise you, etc. Players will still want to keep it tight, but will want to move fast and get as much vision as possible instead of conga line three tiles for 1000 turns.","1377994458"

"homestuck","t5_2rzgi","Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me of that. Let me try to re-summarize that, if you don't mind:

So, in the Alpha kids' world, there is the presence of a character known as the Batterwitch. She's a character from the Alternian session (Feferi's predecessor and the empress of Alternia). The trolls remember that she took off with a huge army and never came back. As it turns out, she'd somehow made it to this post-scratch Earth. Using the title of Condensce, she's been trying to dominate Earth while finding a way to recreate the Matriorb, which had been destroyed during the Alternian troll's session and is the egg which could repopulate the Trolls' species.

Herself aware of Lord English's approach, she's been trying to find a way to stop him as well. At the moment, she's decided the best way to accomplish the groups' mutual goal is to take control of the players and force them to follow what she believes is the right path to success, rather than letting them try and find a solution on their own. So far, she's accomplished this by hacking Jane's headband (which was made of CrockerCorp technology), and by controlling Dog-tier Jade (using powers similar to both Vriska's and Tavros' from the Alternian session). She seems to be placing the Beta kids and the Trolls on their respective session planets, to force them both to finish the quests they hadn't been able to in their own sessions, to make them stronger. Meanwhile, she locked Roxy in a Dersite prison and has been forcing her to try and re-create the Matriorb with her god-tier powers of Void.

To be honest, I don't think Caliborn's story has much weight to the main plot. It seems mostly like fuel for prequel-esque story (to explain why finding Alternate Calliope's ghost is so important and explain where Lord English came from) and to stall for time with obnoxious gags mocking Caliborn's childish nature.

As for John's extra-canonical adventures, I don't think they've become quite relevant yet, but suspect that he'll eventually reach a position to affect events using his new abilities.","1377994458"

Edit: As to your other point, I wouldn't make a post like this because I think that this point is pointless. What it boils down to is, basically, if the shot looks how the director intended it to, it works, and if it doesn't, it didn't. ","1377994459"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was homeschooled from 3rd to 5th grade.

Personally, I did not like it. It was during a very rough time in my family's life- we had just moved away from all of my childhood friends, the neighborhood we were in terrified me, I had no friends, and I was very lonely. My mother tried her best to help me, but I my two younger siblings needed her help more than I did, being kindergartners, so I tried to do everything myself to keep her from worrying and to keep her from stressing out too much.

When we finally moved away, I started public school. I should have gone into the 6th grade, but the principal sat me down and told me I could go into the 5th grade if I felt I wasn't ready. I am very grateful he gave me that option, because I hadn't learned all I should have while homeschooled, and going in a grade below allowed me to catch up. Also, I met my best friends there, one of which I am rooming with at college right now.

While I was homeschooled, I was very lonely. I read and wrote a lot, which has helped me greatly (I am a pretty good English student), and my imagination grew, but I also gained a lot of weight for a young girl, and it's taken me all this time to shed it. However, even though my experience wasn't that great, I do think that homeschooling can be a good option, especially when it's done right. I don't blame my parents for putting me in homeschool- it was better than the public school system we were in, and they tried their best. 

My life is pretty good now, so I can't really complain. ","1377994460"

Jag hade kunnat länka till occams razor (du behöver postulera mer än jag för att förklara samma fenomen), men jag tyckte att argumenten kunde stå för sig själv, utan hänvisning till häftiga wikisidor.

Vad jag argumenterar för att är vi inte behöver göra en ofördelaktig tolkning av data (som *dessutom* kan ha ofördelaktiga konsekvenser), när en fördelaktig (enklarare) tolkning fungerar lika bra. Att *välja* att tolka på ett sätt som får någon att se dum ut skulle kunna beskrivas som ett ""strawman argument"".

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","That mentality didn't come about in a vacuum, though. If there's a path of lesser resistance to the reward, they're going to gravitate to that path rather than take the more challenging route. Most players only have a couple hours a day to devote to gaming, they become hesitant to jump in on something if they feel like they're wasting their time. A highly difficult open world event with eighty-plus people partaking is no longer a matter of skill, but a matter of hoping nobody else screws up. It becomes less a challenge than a roulette wheel. And, hooboy, just imagine the drama too. That's not an encouragement to jump in on the event if there are more palatable options out there.

I saw this happen in City of Heroes, where there were multiple options of varying difficulty for incarnate raiding and, in the end, certain raids were outright neglected in favor of the steamroll options. Underground and MoM were highly challenging raids abandoned in favor of cycling through the BAF-Lambda-PTN facerolls. Then came the outcry when the devs said they were taking away rewards from BAF and Lambda to do the more challenging content. Guildies I rarely saw posting to the forums stepped up to say 'This was unacceptable.' It was the biggest player revolt I had ever seen right up until the closing was announced. Paragon eventually conceded and they even nerfed Keyes to boot.

Honestly, I can sympathize, but I'm just having a hard time seeing something as challenging as advertised not becoming something that turns into pulling teeth just to get the requisite eighty-plus players to join in on.","1377994468"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In our younger days, my buddy - we'll call him Brian - would pick me up late at night during our summers home from college, and we would go for burn rides. If you aren't familiar with the terminology, we would basically drive around and smoke a bunch of weed. 

I came home one weekend with some serious, serious weed. We're talking 70's weed. Weed that Willie Nelson would post a reaction gif for. It was the shape of a handheld Christmas tree and you could smell it through the bag. He texted me about 1am one morning and said, ""you ready to roll?"". That was my cue to head out to the end of the driveway. He picked me up a few minutes later. 

I brought along my grinder (device to grind up chunks of weed) and rolling papers. Basically, I came in tow with a satchel of fun. All the paraphernalia you would need. We had a favorite spot to drive to, a natural waterfall about ten miles from our neighborhood in the middle of the woods along an enclosed, forested path. If Bum Fuck Egypt were a place, this dwarfed it. There were rarely cars on this road during the day let alone at 130am, so it was the perfect place for a late night Cheebfest 2006. 

I gave a lengthy soliloquy on how good the weed I had was the entire ride there. We pulled up to the waterfall spot and over to the side of the road where we parked. It had begun to rain. Just slightly. He turned on the parking lights and flipped on the center console. Everything was as it was the hundred times before it. The air was crisp, the waterfall was flowing, and the weed was *very* dank. I began to fish around for my bag of tricks. He was in the middle of pulling out some pictures he found of us and our friends from high school. While we were both preparing for the journey, he paused.

""Hey followmarko, look.""

I stopped fidgeting around for my paraphernalia and looked up. A pair of lights started coming down the road in front of us. The road we drove in on was barely big enough for two cars and bent sharply right just past the waterfall, so all you could see was the ever-brightening lights appearing in the darkness. The was the first time we had ever seen another car by the waterfall. We stared ahead in anticipation as the lights came into full view. We could tell it was a large vehicle, an SUV, as it made the turn around the bend in front of us. As its headlights illuminated our sedentary smoking station, the vehicle began to slow down as it creeped towards us. 

""Shit, Brian, I think they're stopping.""

The passenger window of the SUV stopped directly next to my passenger window. They turned off their headlights. At this point, several ""I'm shitting my pants"" thoughts raced through my head. We had never encountered another human being on this road, and now someone had parked right next to us. There was not a doubt in my mind we were about to be robbed and killed. Frankly, it was the perfect spot. There was no house for five miles in either direction of the road. I gripped everything around me tightly and just went, *""Oh, fuck.""*

A light beamed instantaneously into my window, nearly blinding both of us. We heard someone yell from the vehicle. I rolled down my window and covered my eyes with my hand in an attempt to see past the bright light. 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GUYS?"" a stern voice rang out. My eyes adjusted and I realized I was looking at a cop's vehicle.

""N-n-nothing."" I stammered out in fear. I was frozen. I had no idea what to say because it was raining and I couldn't see into the cop's car. All I could see was a blinding light. Brian suddenly chimed in.

""WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT PICTURES, SIR."" A true statement, in a way.

The cop paused. A few seconds went by. 

""Get out of here."" 

He then turned off the light, rolled up his window, and drove off.

At that point, I unclenched everything I was holding on to and let out a gasping whoosh of air. I also most likely let out a walled up dam of shit into my pants. Neither of us said anything past ""Holy shit."" to each other. He threw the car into drive and we edged away in the opposite direction of the cop. From where I was sitting, in the passenger seat, I could still smell the weed in the side door pocket next to me. Had the cop decided to find out what we were actually doing parked in the middle of nowhere next to a waterfall at 2am in the morning, there's not a doubt in my mind I would have had a lot of explaining to do. 

We ended up passing the cop on the road on the way out. 

For some reason, part of me thought that the cop probably assumed we were to gay lovers about to fuck in an SUV in the middle of the woods.

I don't mind extra bulk if it's still portable maybe for not everyday but if I know I want a specific shot. 

In light room all I would do is edit my photographs to balance my shots and maybe add some flare to others.

exactly.  the only reason obama would be impeached is if it was determined Biden would be a better salesman for war.  This is why I'm glad obama won instead of Romney, or McCain before that.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Thank you.  I think I'm actually getting somewhere now.

First, is this what I'm looking for, and is this a trustworthy source for downloading something I'm going to install and run?

https://www.downloadster.net/open-office-writer/

&gt; Things you might be confused by

Here's another.  Am I supposed to save what I write in some particular form?  If so, what?  Do I save it as an ebook or something?

&gt; Upload an image in jpg format, I prefer 1800px by 2700px. This will be the cover image that people see when they're looking at your book in the store page, and when they look at the cover on their Kindle device.

I assume I can make this in anything that makes images?  Does it have to be ""jpg format"" or can it be something else?  And is the size you mentioned better for some reason than another size?  It seems pretty big to me.

&gt; Upload your book file.

See, to me this is like saying ""put the crate on the truck"" and I'm just beginning to see what you're getting at.  My ""book file"" is what, exactly?  What I saved in OpenOffice Writer?  I'm guessing that I tell KDP the name of it and it will find it.

&gt; it'll take a few hours to upload

Hours?  I have to leave my computer sitting as I wait?  Or do you mean it won't show up somewhere for hours, not that the upload actually takes that long?

&gt; If you don't show nudity and your book doesn't involve incest, bestiality, or other illegal sex acts, you should be fine.

You mean they'll reject it if you WRITE about things that are illegal??  Or is it just sex things that are illegal that they censor?  That seems bizarre.  What jurisdictions are they talking about, in any case?  If it's just sex things you can't write about, that won't be a problem for me, that's not what I write, but it's still bizarre.

Final question, does this method publish the ebook everywhere, or is this just for Amazon?","1377994478"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;The meaning of a word is determined by its use, not an archetype

As a descriptive grammarian, I agree with what you're attempting to say. However (and you may see this as pedantic), I would make the important distinction that a word's meaning is determined by *popular use*, not just its use. That is to say: please don't take descriptivism as free reign to make up meanings to words or to completely ignore established meanings of established words. 

*Fraud* has a very clear and widely understood meaning and connotation. 

*Hypocrite* has a very clear and widely understood meaning and connotation. 

The meanings are not the same; these words are not interchangeable. While I'm sure there are certain situations in which both words can accurately be used to describe the same subject, each word retains its very singular and discrete meaning. Your assertion that both words are used to refer to the same  [something something something] is ignorant and lazy.

If you're feeling enterprising (and you have an additional pilot to help), you can film the takeoff, move the camera (don't stop recording! It will make it easier to sync the audio later) and film the cruise or maneuvers, then replace it for a landing shot.

If your passengers agree to being filmed, you can point the camera into the cabin and record their expressions during maneuvers and stuff.

You can use your smartphone(s) as a sort of steadycam and incorporate your and your passenger's footage. I've seen that used to good effect.

During post-production, use side-by-side shots or PIP for some cool effects.

Don't use **Sail** as the audio as tempting as it may be. I'm not sure why, but that's what reddit seems to have decided. The chick in the music video is pretty hot.

&gt; Interacting in the community is a great way to promote Freemasonry in a way that serves an unselfish purpose.

Sure, but is that the *responsibility* of a lodge? I'd argue that it's the purview of the individual Masons, themselves. The purpose of a lodge - as stated by the regulations of many GLs - is to make Masons. Everything else is secondary.

I've learned lots of new things, and for every lecture there's always a practical example of using what was taught. For example:

When we did Stacks and Queue's, we learned about programming Dijkstra's Two-Stack Algorithm for Infix Expressions, and for sorting we learned about Convex Hulls.

"HistoryPorn","t5_2skqi","My grandfather was a B-29 captain in the South Pacific theater and was extensively involved in flying fire bombing runs over Japanese mainland. He recounted a story to me once about his bombardier who ended up becoming an exec for the American branch of Mitsubishi. He was once in Japan on business, and a rather eccentric seeming Japanese exec struck up a conversation with him, and as they got to know each other, the exec asked him if he had fought in the war and what his role was. When he responded that he was a bombardier in the pacific theater, the man asked if he ever firebombed Tokyo. Obviously uncomfortable at this point, the bombardier answered that he had flown five missions over Tokyo. The bombardier expected him to get angry, but instead he simply started laughing and thanked the bombardier. The bombardier asked why, to which he replied ""I always hated that house but my wife loved it and never wanted to move. It was destroyed one night in a firebombing run, and I was later able to build the house of my dreams.""

Anyhow, it always seemed like such a strange story to me, because I can't imagine anyone being genuinely happy that his house was destroyed by napalm, but my grandfather always insisted that it was true. Perhaps the guy just had a really good outlook and sense of humor about things. I guess maybe that was a rare example of the brighter side of war. ","1377994491"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Quality of education doesn't solely rely on financial resources. My grandfather was the head of a poor country school in Taiwan, so compared to most US schools it was a shithole, but the teachers and environment were still good enough to raise good students, like my mom and her family.

There are always students willing to learn regardless of the situation everywhere, but to properly educate a large number of kids requires a higher quality of human resources, which are in short supply in poorer areas of the US. Either at home or in the school itself. It's horrible when students just don't care, but the real problem is when the actual teachers, staff, and adults around them care even less. 

That being said, to say there aren't kids in Asia who aren't unmotivated and involved in violent crime and general ignorance. They just don't make it to the US. That's just racist to assume that Asians are just ""smarter"" or more motivated just by seeing the ones in the US. Then it's double racist to assume that other minorities don't exemplify that because of their race (or culture hurr durr).","1377994494"

I'm slightly confused a to why they really need more than 10meg. It's really quite a bit. How many users?

I do think that it would be nice to have fiber shot over to the town. But fiber, where you can get it, costs a ton too.  Not Google Fiber prices :)

So maybe you can use this as a platform for town wide / municipal ISP, but its going to coat quite a bit per month. Fiber 18 miles away will not cost less than their current 10meg. Plus hardware costs to bring it to the school. 

I get that you can subsidize it with having town people pay for it as their ISP. But it's not going to be cheap. This is a pretty big project.

EDIT: Maybe you should look at reselling high speed to the town during non peak usage (nights/weekends) from their existing pipe to generate income and increase plausibility of this working as a town wide rollout.  ","1377994496"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Slept with one of my HS teachers while I was a college student a year or 2 later.  

Basically we got a new math teacher when I was a senior in HS.  I think it was her first teaching gig out of College.  24 or 25, pretty and very smart.  She wasn't a smoking hot pure sex type of women we all dream that would be our teachers, but the more subdued..looks good in a sweater or cardigan and skirt type.  I'd say almost librarian...but don't want to come across as stereotypical.  Anyway she was professional at the school...no funny stuff.  She was/is a good educator.  She's still there.  

I had just turned 21 that fall and was home I think on either thanksgiving or christmas leave from school.  I was coming out of the grocery store and pushing the cart in the parking lot and I hear ""Well hello Mr. Brown"" (She referred to kids' last names for whatever reason) and I was like oh shit Miss so and so.  So we talk a little bit, but we're in a busy parking lot with people waiting for spots.  So she asks if I'd like to go across the street to a typical stripmall sports bar with her and catch up.  I didn't have anything that needed to go to the fridge, so I said sure.  

Couple hours later we're still there, maybe she was giving off signs..I dunno.  I actually was enjoying talking to her.  She had been married while I was at school and was just very recently divorced.  Guess it was a rough one and I think just looking for a companion.  She's like listen, I don't normally do this, but would you like to come back to my place?  After I picked my mouth up off the floor I said sure.  It was pretty fantastic.  First experience with an older women...they're much better than college girls.  Nothing cliche like ""oh I used to dream about you in class type of shit"".  Basically two adults treating each other like adults.  It did take a while for me to stop calling her Miss so and so.  Her small house literally overlooked my old high school, which was a little weird.  I saw her a couple more times during that break and carried an occasional relationship for quite a while while on breaks and such.  We'd talk via email or AIM (Texting wasn't the thing then).  I'd help her with odd stuff while I was down, networked her house, occasional car stuff.  Went to the beach, coffee..movies frequently.  Was a good experience.

Eventually She ended up finding another husband.  I found my wife.  10 years later we still keep in contact.  Actually helped her and her husband find a new house about 6 months ago.  

TLDR:  Got together with one of my HS teachers outside of school a year or 2 later.

Free market advocates see markets as something that comes into being by itself, but the market for electricity is the grid, which is a vast machine that someone has to pay for. 

There is also a deep math problem involved. The market model (and all economic models afaik) depend on arithmetic. That is, they assume that 2+2=4, and so on. However, 2+2 doesn't necessarily equal 4 in an AC circuit, and the grid is a (mostly) AC circuit. So the concept of a demand curve doesn't apply, even in theory. 

EDIT: Let's say farmer A brings two bushels of potatoes to the market, and farmer B brings three bushels. What is the total supply of potatoes? Five bushels. This needs to be true for market economics to apply. If the answer is not five bushels, the math doesn't work, and the whole concept of price signals fails.","1377994500"

You really want to use ""an American conservative Christian group and lobbying organization formed in the United States in 1981 by James Dobson."" as your example? Instead of actual scientific research. If you call yourself a student in your user name you should actually know the difference. I like how you claim bias on supposed ""opportunists"" and yet ignore the actual scientific study on the issue. Which ""surprise"" isn't coming from the FRC.

The common argument coming from many conservative outlets is that the scientific study is obviously biased. But when the counter is from obviously biased groups such as the FRC the lay man starts to think that maybe people claim ""liberal bias"" simply because scientific study doesn't confirm what their value system predicts.

I like how you think being on the top of Google results indicates scientific validity and I also like how you buy into so quickly the claim the author makes that their research tops all others on the topic.

While I don't claim that there are simplified studies out there to simply uphold a liberal belief. The hard science and hundreds of papers on the subject that come out of universities has not caused the intellectual community to come to the public stating that homosexual parents have been indicated as worse than heterosexual ones. To actually get a paper published it gets reviewed very carefully to be rid of possible bias in many different aspects. Maybe if you owned up to your name and actually read about scientific research you would know this.

TL;DR - If you want to learn about human sexuality and it's relating topics the FRC is probably not the best source for your information. Why don't you go read on the topic if you're a student in high school or college I dare you to go read ten books on the subject. ","1377994501"

The most interesting part of this book for me was that when I moved to Santa Barbara to go to school (i.e, to drop out of school and go to city college instead and have a good time by the beach) I learned during my employment as a Segway Tour Guide that that book was actually written about Santa Barbara's Channel Islands. The woman was on the Channel Islands when the Aleutians came and she remained on the islands for 25 years, until they brought her back and she subsequently died from disease, I forgot which one. 


It's a beautiful and sad story that was so significant to me for so long, so to move to the place where it happened and then to learn about it afterward was just really cool.","1377994502"

They are waiting for fucking MADRID. WTF...so we panic run in the airport only to realize that they had change the gate for Paris. We had the wrong gate number printed on our tickets. 

When we finally reach the right gate, the airline employees said that they called our names repeatedly on the intercom and that one of them went to check at the Madrid gate.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","This sort of ""philosophy"" is merely trying to pin down meanings of words more strictly than human language allows. You know every detail of the situation: it's possible for a person to lack trait X, but exceedingly rare; anyone's lacking of the trait depends on their rearing and not their genes; that dependency is direct and doesn't, for instance, manifest as the person's choices as influenced by how they are raised. Knowing whether it's ""innate"" tells you nothing.

It might be useful to say that something's innate if you're dealing with a system of law that involves different treatment of innate traits than of non-innate traits, but that's no longer dealing with the same definition of ""innate"". Consider how a recent human rights commission determined that atheism is a creed -- it isn't, by any common definition, but creeds receive specific protections, and that commission determined that atheism should receive those same protections.

That principle is a good one to have in general. If you are confused about whether to apply a label to something, just ask what different labels get you. Most of the time, it's nothing, or as near to nothing as makes no difference. At that point, why are you even talking about it?","1377994520"

A MySQL database is inside a file, or multiple files.

I don't think you understand what you're saying.

Just so you know, it would be quite easy for a database that uses a single file (SQLite) to get fully corrupt, where as if you setup innodb tables in MySQL and set the file_per_table configuration you would spread the risk out across many files. Not just that, but using the innodb file per table configuration makes backing up single tables easy at a file based level.

A few buses are always pay when you get on but the driver will let you know.

The reason for this is, on some buses, if you ride far enough away from downtown, you have to pay a higher fare (zone 2). For example, if you get on in downtown heading outbound, the driver doesn't know if you're going to zone 1 or 2 and so you pay when you get off.

As for the doors thing, you can request that they open the back doors to get off (if you paid getting on) but they generally only acquiesce if the bus is super crowded (and then they'll sometimes open it automatically). Don't know why they do it this way, but they do. Many other cities in the US and abroad do it this way as well, though.","1377994535"

There's a line of surrender that needs crossed and for many people a there's a mental block placed there by a judeo-christian society that prevents it from happening.

Who wrote the ""rule"" that thinking of your partner and what you are experiencing right then is the only right way to do it. I guess it just ""seems"" right. In all actuality, the trick is very often to allow your brain to venture into forbidden territory... gang bang, interracial, same sex, whatever it might be, as long as it does the job of kicking you across the line into the zone of total submission to sensation.

It's important to remember two things. Just because thinking about something takes you there doesn't mean you actually want to do it. It very well may, but there's a whole lot of things that have to happen between thinking and doing that may cause someone to not want to actually... perfectly fine.

Another is that once you find it... keep it to yourself. It's just one of those things that are uniquely personal and carry a tremendous risk of being over-analyzed misunderstood by others.","1377994541"

The nicest of the three rashguards as far as functionality goes, is one from Odin. It has a reenforced neck area, as well as a band of elastic around the bottom that is also rubberized on the inside to prevent it from riding up during grappling. The designs are printed using a sublimated process so that it will never peel off. That's really the ONLY complaint (small as it may be) to using compression shirts, is that grappling is a little more intensive and that leads to the logos peeling off. But really if that's the biggest problem encountered, then it can't be a bad thing.","1377994545"

"Northwestern","t5_2qptt","For all you newcomers, a little primer: last year, the 'Cats had one of their best years in recent history, going 10-3 and winning their first bowl game since 1949. This year, we return most of our starters and have the potential to be an even better team than last year. Cal, however, has a new coach and is a bit of a threat. This is a great game to watch to see what we've got this year.

A quick list of players to watch out for:

Kain Colter is our starting quarterback. Decent arm, better runner. 

Trevor Siemian is our other quarterback who will play. Better passer, worse runner than Colter. 

You'll hear Venric Mark's name a lot. He our tiny, but speedy, star running back and punt returner. 

When we're on defense, look out for defensive lineman Tyler Scott, cornerback Nick VanHoose, safety Ibraheim Campbell, and linebackers Damien Proby, and Chi Chi Ariguzo.

Our kicker, Jeff Budzien, is also one of the best kickers in the country. 

If anyone has any questions about our team or this game, I, and I'm sure /u/GreatestWhiteShark, would be happy to answer them. Also, if you're a college football fan, feel free to join us at /r/cfb. We could always use more NU representation.

Edit: Also, the hate isn't really in-game. The hate comes into play on public forums where people express all sorts of opinions and generally you will get the most heat from a vocal minority.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","yes, and yes.  I'm not sure sure what you're not understanding.  Iverson's stats were ridiculous and could have been even more ridiculous if he was in a different system.  ""Same player + different system = different stats"" means the idea of getting the true value of a player based on current statistics is absurd.

For example, quantify Reggie Miller's trash talk.  Once you've done that, quantify the deterrent value of Vince Carter's highlight reel dunks on defenders that have to protect the rim.  Once you've done that, quantify the difference between swatting the shit out of somebody vs. blocking it softly towards a teammate.  One method raises your adrenaline, your teammate's adrenaline, the energy of your fans, while the other gets you a more tangible possession.  In both cases, in current statistics, player x, blocks: 1.  And THAT's only if the scorekeepers even managed to record it correctly.  Look up how steals are credited to players.  Look up how chris paul was getting credited for assists at a much greater rate at home games in New Orleans a while back not because he was playing that much better, but because the scorekeeper was criminally lax with what constituted an assist.  two dribbles, a pump fake, a reverse pivot and then a fadeaway from 15 ft?  Meh, assist for cp3!  (source:  http://20secondtimeout.blogspot.com/2008/05/manu-is-man-as-spurs-eliminate-hornets.html)

"Stargate","t5_2qhar","Been a while since I watched stargate, but from what I remember, they came from some planet as parasites able to infect the sentient beings on that planet, which happened to be Unas. 

With their new hosts, they had super strength (by human standards), and extreme healing. They probably started by figuring out how to use the stargate, but as they continued to reproduce, any knowledge gained would have been passed to the next generation, so they would learn rapidly. 

Eventually they decided to use humans as hosts, and as a result, probably got a bit of our greed and arrogance imbedded into them. What's worse is they used human ingenuity and their own combined intelligence to make better technologies by stealing or backwards engineering whatever they found laying around. 

They found the ancient cube device that reanimated dead flesh and toned it down a bit to make the sarcophagus, and from there, they split into the Tokra and Goa'uld. The Tok'ra could see the changes that thing made to them, but overall, the evil Goa'uld went on to become quite numerous and powerful, transporting humans to many different planets.

From there it was really only 4 great races that could have stopped them, but didn't for these reasons:

The Ancients: Deceased/Ascended (and therefore couldn't care less)

The Furlings: Possibly slightly more advanced than humans, became a little overwhelmed by fighting the goa'uld, and likely had many technological secrets stolen by them, thus bringing them to such power. A group of them wanted to stop fighting and made a sanctuary, which was infiltrated by a goa'uld who's plan got everyone (including himself) killed. Jack and Mayborne eventually found out how.

The Nox: Not interested. 

The Asgard: Sympathetic to the oppression of human life, which they see as valuable and full of potential (being the second evolution of that form), but ultimately unable to commit enough resources to destroy the goa'uld due to their war with the Replicators. They've made treaties and protected planets, and occasionally shown the Goa'uld their far superior power to make the system lords afraid to challenge them, but that's about all they could do. 

Other potentially advanced races: Either not interested, unaware of the goa'uld threat, or they underestimated their threat and were destroyed.

The memories of those teams and the excitement of finally having a mlb team in phoenix is what made those colors so great.

Those who claim that acknowledging this patronizes women, or does not give women enough credit for having “agency”, are overestimating female agency and underestimating the power of the patriarchy. 

Free choice is not possible for women in a male-dominated society. We choose from an extremely limited menu presented to us by Dude Nation and none of those choices are all that good. Certainly none of them are as good as what the dudes get. And all of them stink of exploitation. Pretending compliance is empowerment impedes the revolution, because we can’t challenge things we refuse to see clearly. And it’s annoying. Your choices are not immune from criticism just because they’re yours. You don’t have a vial of fairy dust that you can sprinkle all over your patriarchal compliance and turn it into feminist activism. If you’re determined to play pretend, I can’t stop you, but expect your pretension to be criticized. Pouting and accusations of “shaming” will not be accepted as credible arguments. 

Liberals will be especially shocked by this revelation. Choicey-ness is their sacred cow. “How dare anyone criticize MY choices!” is their outraged cry. Choosy choicesters, you need to understand that the things you do don’t happen in a vacuum. They affect other people around you. The more antifeminist ideas and practices you personally choose to embrace, or even tolerate, the more you support male supremacy. And that has immediate, shitty consequences for all the women around you. So stop it.”","1377994559"

Only Ancient Rome in the Punic War era breaks that trend, they took insane losses and kept fielding huge armies like crazy.  

But, settled populations have rapidly outgrown nomadic populations.  And settled populations can now readily field well over 1% of their population (and have been able to since the early modern era).

Who cares if Adam is God or anything else they made up.

On a deeper level, it's a concrete example of old, strange doctrine being swept under the rug because it weirded out enough Mormons. True, it's a rather benign one, more of an inflammatory sticking point for Born-Again Christians, but I think the whole fiasco regarding the incorporation of something as revolutionary as the concept of Adam being the God of us all acts as a fingerprint of Brigham Young's psyche.

so ask yourself, what is more important: trying something new or playing it safe so you can be certain to get your money's worth? choose the former and you have agreed to all the risks that embody the frontier. choose the latter and the one who has made the mistake was you, when you purchased a product clearly not intended for you.

Its amazing how much of our current technology was inspired and generated from Tesla and his ideas and concepts. The calibre of true humanity that he showed by selflessly allowing his designs to be used without licensing is what we as a human culture should strive to emulate. It was like Edison and Tesla were complete opposites of what humans can be, one who creates the unimaginable and one who steals it.

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","Well....trying to compare Gladiator or Braveheart to Rome is just insulting to Rome. Seriously, Rome has minor things to nitpick - the most major would probably be them saying that Caesar was a consul at the same time as Pompey. Gladiator and Braveheart are just...wrong. In SO many ways. As I tell people, they're great films, just don't expect to learn any history whatsoever from them. Hence the reason why I consider Rome to be infinitely better than either of them :P Hell, Kingdom of Heaven wasn't half bad either, if you watch the director's cut. But Gladiator/Braveheart/The Patriot....*shudder*

The biggest issue is that, despite the fact that these films use Hollywood license VERY liberally, they still claim to have ""historian consultants."" That leads to people taking them seriously. People taking them seriously leads to misconceptions all OVER the place, which leads to people thinking they know more about history than historians, which causes bad education to happen. You wouldn't imagine how many times I've had people tell me *in person*, completely believing what they were saying, that 300 was pretty accurate, sans the monsters. 

Personally, I can't wait for Rome II to come out - as you said, it's a game and I'm not pushing perfect accuracy on that ;) It's the misconceptions that SPAWN from that that I try to fix as much as I can :) Does that make more sense?

Dota 2 isn't in the PC gaming area because Valve isn't at PAX Prime, they aren't promoting the game there so why exactly would their exhibition areas have the game installed?

They're avoiding people putting backdoors and viruses on the computers by installing software without their permission

This has nothing to do with Riot. Do people seriously have no memory, or are they just consciously ignoring the fact that *last year* when Valve DID choose to host Dota 2 with PAX Prime, Riot was also hosting their NA Regional qualifiers at the same time and had absolutely no problem with Dota 2's presence at the event.

I was wrong. So i had to get the heavy weapon ammo to its right (which brought me to 99% ugh) and then get over to its left to get the other one. One time i succeeded in getting both ammo boxes and then i charged up the cain and then fired it and then i died. I was too close and i killed myself.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","It's overrated in the sense that people who would want to emulate the main character completely miss the moral of the movie's story. It's overrated in the sense that Tony Montana is not really a hero but a tragic character (duh). I love the hell out of this movie but I feel that many people who like it (hip-hop artists) simply stop watching the movie after the montage with the wedding and the tiger. Montana achieves everything he sets out to do to the very end of his dreams only to realize his dreams were empty and unsatisfactory. And it isn't even just a snap realization right before kicking the bucket. The movie spends a whole dinner scene rolling around in the utter disappointment Montana finds at the end of his criminal rainbow. It's only after he's fully taken it all in that he self-destructs and literally destroys the lives of everyone around him. 

This would be a memorable movie for how quotable it is or for the killer performance from Pacino, one of his last great ones. It would be remarkable for the (at the time) record number of ""fucks"" given or the extreme violence. It's a great movie because it has all these things and a wonderful, tragic story, awards be damned.","1377994591"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I did this when I was 19. I had state over there  that morning to catch a few z's after working a graveyard because i didn't have a ride to my fiancee's and my mother's house was within walking distance from where I worked. I woke up at 2:00pm and saw that my 15 yer old brother had stolen my cigarettes. So I tell her that she needs to start punishing him and keeping him in line and she losses it on me so I tell her she needs to stop acting like a preteen little bitch. She punched me in the face an dug her nails into my chest an sliced me open. She said and I quote, ""Why should I do anything for you when you do nothing for me?"" 

A little backstory here. This is the woman who left my dad when I was 4 because she didn't the responsibility of being a parent. She wanted to spend all her time fucking strangers, drinking, and going out dancing. So she is not a great mother/person in general.

So after she asks me this, what do I do. I walk into her room, grab the bottle of $85.00 perfume I just bought her for her birthday, and I smash that motherfucker on the floor at her feet.

She then punches me again and grabs me  with the talons she calls nails by my arms. Then she proceeds to scream in my face, ""Hit me! Come on hit me you bastard.""

I free myself from her grip walk out of her house and throw my spare key over the fence into my neighbors house.

THE END

TL;DR:  My mom is an immature cunt.

Sorry for the grammar and everything. I'm on my IPhone.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Well it's a strange fight scene, because yes, it's funny as all hell, but feels really legit too. The fight doesn't feel choreographed at all, well for the most part anyway. Like when he accidentally smashes Keith David's car window, then laughs about it. Really felt like an accident.

There's nothing flashy at all in it, intricate martial arts or whatever, its all brute force. It's a fight between two guys where neither really seem to know much about fighting beyond putting your fist into the other guys face. Its lasts like seven minutes but stays consistently interesting the entire time. 

The injuries accrue through the fight semi naturally, like Keith David having that skin scraped off the back of his head. It feels like the two get winded and lose endurance naturally through the course of both exerting themselves and getting punched multiple times.

Things like that I think make it a really memorable fight. Sure it's not the most realistic fight, few in cinema are. But it feels incredibly honest, like I could step out of a bar and see this fight going on. So yeah, it rocks.","1377994596"

"mwo","t5_2t1w0","One choice I really have to disagree with is the JM6-DD. Those six ballistics slots are not going to get used unless you go for machine guns, which isn't what the Jager is for (it's not a brawler). You're also paying through the nose for an extremely suboptimal XL engine such as the XL260, and for FF armour which you'll absolutely want to remove and replace with ES anyway.

The JM6-S still offers a plentiful four ballistics slots, alongside two extra energy hardpoints which can be put to much better use. And if you want versatility, the JM6-A can still mount the standard ""big gun"" Gauss/AC-20-based builds, but on a whim it can switch to a pretty good LRM-45 platform. Both of them are cheaper too, and they're viable with Std engines (they *do* have big side torsos) while you wait to buy a *good* XL engine like a 255, 280 or 300.

Asides from that, it's a really solid guide.","1377994596"

I'm sure the billions a year in medicaid fraud also doesn't happen either.  But keep on believing that everyone does everything by the book.

I know one girl who never even had to show up at an office to get Medicaid.  She mailed in her application and a picture of a positive test and got on it.  She told all the girls at the club and they flooded the Medicaid office with applications.  

Government offices have to spend all their budget or they get less the next year.  It's absolutely no surprise they they would relax the regulations to make sure they get that full budget next year.

I'm glad you had to go through the proper process to get it.  I happen to live in a state with the most corrupt politicians per capita than any other state in the country.

First basic shaving passes need to be light and smooth, Anytime I suddenly find a stop i pretty much get cut without trying. Then making the upper lip easier to shave, for the middle I try to stretch my lip under my teeth a little to flatten the area around it and this keeps me from trying to dig out the center depression. The out side I feel needs to be puffed out a little with air or tongue, my overall curvature it need about 3-4 areas of adjustment, so this isn't a 1 pass like a cartridge would be.

And while your at it, tell me how they rigged the demolition to go off at the exact point where the planes crashed into the buildings. That's some pretty fancy work there. Explosives that can withstand a plane crashing into it and they still go off perfectly without a hitch.

*CONTAINS SWEAR WORDS*

A koala was sitting in a tree smoking a joint when a lizard walks up and says ""Hey koala what are you doing?""

The koala answers ""Smoking a joint, come up and have some.""

The lizard climbs up and the two share the joint. After a while the lizard says his mouth is dry and excuses himself to a nearby river to have a drink.

The lizard, so stoned, leans over too far and falls in. A crocodile swims out to rescue him. When they get onto dry land, the croc asks, ""What's wrong with you, lizard?""

The lizard tells him that he was smoking a joint with a koala, and he got too stoned and fell in while taking a drink.

The croc has to see this for himself, so he asks the lizard to take him to the koala. When they get back to the tree, the croc looks up at the koala and says ""Hey, you.""

The koala looks down and says ""Shiiiit dude, how much water did you drink?""

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","I think this mixes science and religion in a way that makes little sense, such as mentioning those distinct ""ages"" and linking objective, physical processes to subjective morality. The fatalist attitude behind this is something I dislike about many religions.

As for the reasons people are atheists, I think the ""teenage rebellion"" argument is a low blow and a condescending over-simplification. There are plenty of young people in secular societies who have atheist parents and are atheists themselves, with no sign of rebellion there. 

I think the whole connection between the origin of the universe and religion is in itself a religious one, which probably seems far more important for religious people than for atheists. I don't know how the universe began. Accepting that there was a big bang, I don't know what, if anything, caused it, whether we will ever find out, or whether that is even a meaningful question. I just don't see any evidence at all that there was a god behind it. Even if one accepts the philosophical necessity of a ""prime mover"" or first, uncaused cause, I see absolutely no reasons to assume that this cause was a sentient, intelligent being with a consciousness that in some way resembles ours. And even if there *was* such a being, I would not automatically think it should be worshiped, considered a ""god"" or be seen as a moral authority.

So that's one reason I'm an *atheist*. There are other reasons why I oppose *religions*, but that's not the same as being an atheist.","1377994617"

To do so successfully, you space your webs along the lane to detect when the enemy gets sentry wards, and you constantly check inventories. Next, you can use your spiderlings do detect their detection, as lane creeps will autoattack you and your spiders when the enemy team has vision. Careful positioning and play can make you quite a force in lane, as you get ridiculous run speed on webs and can use spiderlings to body block during an escape. Yes, brood still has an abysmal winrate, but I think it's largely due to people having no idea how to play her.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll assume you mean a tablet running a tablet OS such as android, because the differences between Win8 on either tablet or PC are main;ly down to hardware and ultimately that you need to judge how much power you need.

A tablet does 90% of what most people need, music, facebook, email etc and isn't really capable of doing things such as editing things like music, photos or to some extent documents.

I will also assume you will buy a laptop that is strong enough to meet an individuals needs, so price is irrelevant.

A laptop could create 3D models in Blender, Tweak music in Audacity, create a presentation in LibreOffice and do everything a tablet can do.

I also find it easier to do admin tasks on a laptop, such as organising files or backing up documents.


So, to me at least, a tablet is designed to be easy and portable to browse the web and act as a light media center; a laptop is designed to create things, where instead of just browsing or viewing you need to have a greater variety of input and power.

If you can create a 3D model on a tablet, I probably wouldn't enjoy it whereas I really like messing around in blender as a hobby.","1377994630"

I've been told because I'm British I won't get some of the references, however even if this is the case, it is still absolutely hilarious. The combat is engaging and enjoyable, this is simply because there are loads of different interesting weapons as well as the super powers. I'm playing on hard at the moment and having some trouble sometimes, the difficulty curve is a bit all over the place but it's not too challenging. All in all a really good game so far, would recommend.

**Rainbow 6: Vegas 2** I am playing this game co-op with my friends a lot recently which is a ton of fun. This is an old game now but the terrorist hunt mode is just a blast. I got this game when I was into CoD so I guess I didn't appreciate how good it is until recently. It still has a few issues though but I'm enjoying it. It is bloody difficult though, so expect for enemies to constantly one-shot you. Also, one thing which I really like (a very small feature), is how the shotguns act like real shotguns and don't have some shitty nerfed range to make them more fair (anybody who has ever fired a shotgun IRL will know exactly what I'm talking about).","1377994631"

By default, the piano roll window should have three distinct sections: the toolbar at the top, the actual sequencer in the middle, and the editor at the bottom. Next to the tool selection in the toolbar should be some words depending on what you have selected: Piano roll - &lt;Channel name&gt; - &lt;Note property&gt;. The default note property is the note velocity. So you'll probably see something like: Piano roll - &lt;Channel&gt; - Velocity.

If velocity is selected, the editor beneath the sequencer will be displaying the individual note velocities (which you can edit there). These show up beneath the start of every note as lines with points at the top and a bar extending for the length of the note. Their heights indicate their values.

Are any of these lower than the rest? I was wondering if you had maybe made some edits there that you hadn't meant to or that you had forgotten about.","1377994631"

If we bet and get called, there are basically no good turn cards for our hand and if we get raised otf, we are likely up against a draw which has 40%+ equity vs us already or a made hand which has 85-95% equity vs us.

If it were heads-up to the flop, it would be much different. 5-way it is just so much more likely that someone hit that board hard. Get my point?","1377994633"

"Smite","t5_2stl8","I like Guan's New ult. It's great. It's just a bit irritating how he was changed--some of the tweaks are backwards. It isn't the ult being difficult to use that makes me dislike his changes (it is honestly very easy to use). It is that his changes don't make sense within the context of his new role and the changes in meta.

1) Now that he is meant to deal damage and have more power than ever before, they removed the scaling from his heal to give it base scaling depending on damage he's taken. This is backwards. That would have made sense back when he was a tank, but it is the exact opposite of what it should be now that he's building damage items.

2) His new ult is worse for ganking than his old ult. Now that he is viable as a jungler, why would they remove one of the best ganking tools in the game from him in turn for an ult that is basically Kali's ult with more movement speed and some CC with less range-of-motion and damage? It just doesn't make sense.

3) They seem to have designed the new Guan based on an obsolete meta where he would be meant for a 1v2 lane as a bruiser. That meta is dying out and you are starting to see nearly every bruiser better suited for jungling instead. Guan is now conflicting in what role he is meant to fill as he is just far weaker compared to other bruisers in terms of roaming utility.

If you jungle as Guan now, you have a useless heal that is all but pointless for a gank. You have weak mobility and damage that takes a long time to deal itself out (his 3 and his ult being pretty much all of his damage) which means he is not well suited to tower diving. Which is especially a problem because the CC on his ult will either take a long time to be dealt, or he will lose more than half of his total potential damage if he cancels the ult for an early stun. On top of that, he just has below average CC/control which would be essential for his style of ganking.

If you put him in solo lane, you'll have an even worse time. He can't compare at all to the push potential and the defensive capabilities of Vamana or Hercules in the solo side lane. He can't trade against them either as Herc will just stun him and vamana will burn his casts and dash away. Against the increasingly popular mage solo side laners like Chang'e, Ra, Chronos and Zhong Kui, it's even worse. Guan will just get out-pushed and have no control in lane. He has to get too close to put any pressure on and will just get zoned out and kited. And even worse is that his heal is by far weaker than all of those 4's own respective heals while he has worse mana control. And he will have little to no staying power if he is able to get aggressive: Zhong will just pop his ult and walk away, Chang'e will heal and use her to to avoid guan's ult stun, Chronos will have plenty of time to ult away from Guan's ult since it takes so long to deal its damage, and Ra will just stand in his heal if Guan tries to ult him and then turn the fight on him.

All in all this leads to Guan not really fitting into the current meta. Sure, he has some decent abilities. It's just that they don't very well apply to how the game is currently played and in the ways that Guan would otherwise be viable to be used.","1377994635"

"hivaids","t5_2sabe","First off, I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. I've been where you are and I can relate to everything you've said here. 

&gt; I have basically gone from being numb, to scared, to incredibly sad, to alright again, and eventually to what I'm feeling now, which I can only describe as immense irritability.

Believe it or not, you're in a state of mourning. HIV is a life-altering event. From this moment on, everything you plan has to be done taking your HIV into consideration.

The good news is that 99.99% of your life, having HIV changes nothing.

The bad news is that having HIV *does* change things when it comes to relationships and sexual encounters. 

In some states you can be criminally charged if you have consensual sex with someone -and someone else objects. In other states, the law recognizes that every adult is responsible for the consequences of their decisions. 

Navigating relationships can be exhausting and frustrating. HIV adds another dimension to that process. More good news: as long as your viral load is undetectable, sexual relations can be pretty normal. There have been no cases of HIV being transferred from a poz partner to their neg partner when the poz partner kept their viral load under control. There have been cases, but they've all had extenuating circumstances ie. non-compliance by the poz partner. 

&gt; Nobody's problems are invalid in the face of mine

This is still an immense thing to be facing, mostly because of the unknown. Take this opportunity to educate yourself. The more you know -and the more casual you can be about your status to others, the better you will handle this. 

I would caution you to be very careful to whom you confide this information. Your parents need to be very considerate of your feelings on this too. Once you live with this for a while -and it takes its proper place in your life, then you can more easily judge when disclosure is appropriate. (FWIW, for 99.99% of your life, disclosure isn't necessary or even worth considering.) 


You might want to check out [Poz.com](http://www.poz.com). There's a lot of good info there. (and a little medical advice that'd make anyone a hypochondriac). Take all the dire stuff as ""this is possible if you don't remain compliant, but it is not inevitable in any way.""

I hope your HIV quickly becomes a non-issue in your life and you are easily able to move forward from this point in your life. ","1377994636"

I asked my friend if I could borrow his bike to get there and back faster and he said yes. I got on the bike and made my way down the hill. Unfortunately, my friend failed to mention that the breaks on the bike were completely cut for some reason I can't remember.

So there i was, speeding down a very steep hill with no breaks. At the bottom of the hill ran a main road perpendicular to the road I was on going straight down the hill. Many thoughts were going through my head , but the main thing was the heavy traffic on the main road. I made a decision and rolled of the bike onto the pavement. I had a t shirt with shorts on, and right before I hit the road all i remember thinking was ""Well I'm Fucked..."".

TL;DR: Sped down a steep hill on a bike with cut breaks, rolled off.","1377994644"

I bet there is a therapist character too. This also isn't a film, it's a MOVIE. 1080p is video quality and doesn't even come close to film res.

Edit: If you are looking to get into a festival you need to be original. It's gonna' be rough for you since you'll be competing with professional filmmakers. My advice, try to cut it down to 40-50min so you can enter it into short narratives. You could have a chance in those competitions.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Those are averages, of course.  Breakfast and lunch are usually cheaper than dinner, for example, and the PBJ lunches balance out the paninis, and a very nice dinner might produce leftovers, so it's not uncommon to spend a lot more than $3 or a lot less than $1 on a given meal.

&gt;As for being able to afford it, I certainly can, but just cause you have the money doesn't mean you need to spend it 

I completely agree.  Many, many people start eating out less when they realize how much they spend on fast food and whatnot.  But it's your money, so if you genuinely enjoy eating out, go for it.  Beyond a certain level, more stuff is just more stress, so spending money on experiences (traveling, the arts, and yes, eating out) are better ways to increase happiness. ","1377994645"

It can only have bothered him that a 37 year old came out of retirement and got more game time than him. 

You can argue that Scholes was a better choice at the time but Pogba was still never given a chance to prove himself. A few league cup matches and the odd sub appearance in the Premiership is not a proper chance.","1377994648"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","After quite bit of searching and following sources, I determined that this claim is bullshit for a variety of reasons.

1. This statement is inaccurate because it refers to a court decision made in 1655 while Massachusetts had statutes legally recognizing slavery in 1641 and Connecticut legalized slavery in 1650. Meaning there were legal slave owners before Anthony Johnson. 
http://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/timeline/1641.html
http://www.constitution.org/bcp/mabodlib.htm

2. After doing a bit of research and finding a lot of hyperbole and different description of the court decision, I decided to look for the official transcript myself. This court decision had nothing to do with making Anthony Johnson the first slave owner. It was a dispute between Johnson and a white slave owner Parker. Parker took Johnson's slave and made a new indentured servant contract with him. Johnson argued that Casor still belonged to him and since he was still his property Parker couldn't take Casor from him. The judge agreed and ruled that Casor be returned back to Johnson. This court decision said nothing about Casor having to be slave for life, it only established that you can not take someone else's property and keep it as your own. Whether or not those possessions are obtained legally, you can't steal from other people. I found no other court records citing this case as legal precedent for anything. 
http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Court_Ruling_on_Anthony_Johnson_and_His_Servant_1655

3. Among the many sites that I read referring to this case, many of them claimed that Anthony Johnson argued ""Thee had ye Negro for his life."" None of them actually properly cited or annotated the quote. Again, I wanted to see the actual court transcript that they pulled this from. Some forums and other conservative sites referred to this site http://suite101.com/article/black-history-spotlight---john-casor-a206298#.UWRXbEpIXJM as the source they used. This article was only posted in March 2013 and it also doesn't actually say where it got the quote. This site used 2 sources http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/johnson.html and http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p262.html and neither of those contain such a quote. Sounds like bullshit created to fit some sort of alternative narrative

4. Now, even if you want to revise the title of this post and qualify it with the word ""Viriginia"", it's still not accurate. In 1640 3 indentured servants/slaves escaped from their plantation and were subsequently caught. 2 of the men were white while 1 was black. All 3 were subject to 30 lashes but the black man, John Punch, was also sentenced back to slavery for LIFE. This was actually the first legally owned lifelong slave in Virginia, not Anthony Johnson, and this took place over a decade before Johnson's court case. This effectively made Hugh Gwyn the first lifelong slave owner in Virginia and established a legal distinction in treatment of black servants vs whites servants. 
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p262.html

5.  After Anthony Johnson died the court by jury decided that since Johnson was black that he was an alien and his land would go back to England. Now, this has nothing to do with the claim made by this post, but dispels some of the bullshit comments made by redditors touting false equivalencies. Johnson was as much of a victim of biased and racist treatment as any other black man and only got lucky when a white judge agreed with him in a civil suit. He was still just a product of his environment and was nowhere near an equal contributor to the racist practices ingrained in old England society.
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1h314t.html


It's clear that this case has been misrepresented to try and besmirch Caucasian responsibility for American slavery and try to spread blame for it's causation to a black man. It completely ignores and trivializes a number of other events that predates this court case and misconstrues the ruling to mean something more than it actually did. They went back and found 1 case involving a black plaintiff in regards to slavery and said ""it's all that guys fault."" Though they don't implicitly place all the blame on Johnson, it's very clear that's the intention behind this movement of misrepresentation and historical inaccuracy. 

Edit: Regarding point 2, some entries characterize this trial as nothing more than Virginia recognizing that black men can own slaves. So it's clear that there are different interpretations of the court decision and its role in the history of slavery. After reading the word for word court decision, you can easily determine which stance more accurately portrays the decision.

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","NOTE: I sent you a message with my cell number. I am off work today and tomorrow and can offer rides, food, shower, etc. I'm here to help, just call.

A word of advice: stay here in Seattle. I lived here for 3 years before leaving for the East coast, hating it, and then moving back just a month or so ago. It's a stellar place to live and work. Some might advise against ""starting your life over"" but based on your story, yours has already started over. Might as well start new in a cool city.

* Find a place to stay for a few days: helpx.net or couchsurfing.com or airbnb.com

* Find a place to work: Day labor places all over the city. You can also sell street food in the Belltown area of the city or wherever food trucks congregate. Also visit Pike Market in the very early AM and help people setup their stalls.

* Find a place to live: Room up with another recent arrival so that you can explore the city together. College kids would be perfect for this - after all, you know they are going to stay here for at least 3-4 years.

* Find things to do: get a library card. You'll need a local ID which you can probably get with a phone bill (easiest thing to setup when you are new here). If you can't get a local ID, I think you can get access to the library for a fee. Think of it as a warm, quiet place with restrooms and WiFi. Cheapest hotel in the city.

* Get clean: Visit a community pool. $5-$6 door fee to swim will get you access to the pool (duh) but also nice showers. Win.

* Eat: Check out chinatown; tons of good Pho and Dim Sum restaurants on the cheap.

* Get around: Buy an ORCA card at one of the underground bus stations in the city. If you buy a cash bus trip, make sure to ask for a ""transfer"" which will let you ride again within 2 hours.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","|Why are people so upset

Non. Refundable. Purchase.

it's basically the teeth coming out and the DLC becoming visible that upsets people. 

prior to this, the hangar was a test run for the technology. you get to see your ships, pilot them, run around. etc.

they decided to test the DLC options before the ships were even ready to go. real money is not the way you test most software,and while there's going to be some glitches. not in the day 1 DLC store... that works perfectly.




So, it's not that the game has been essentially split and subdivided into collective accessories, any game can.

so can art. car parts. body parts, children or loved ones, sewn or melted into something better. or exchanged. 

let's put it this way. 

The choice to implement the cash shop was rushed, or, it wasn't. 

if it was part of the implementation, it was not mentioned. it was not addressed, it was not explained. if you believe the voyager store is a positive option for the game, and i have to say, right now, not quite having CR or another community person to reflect on ""$ vs C"" or ""$ vs Hrs"" and it's impact... it has all the hallmarks of vanity DLC. with a $70 price tag.

the problem, is the weapons being for sale, being non-refundable, and the purchase of credits being an easy implementation of pay to win in the initial gameplay, the noob circuit. 

either the store works as intended, and it needs some clarification on pricing, and also refunds or purchases of UEC to UEC purchases, or USD to UEC purchases, etc. because it's taking real USD funds to purchase items we may have duplicates of in the future, and other varied problems.

i'm not saying you have to buy everything. most people will buy nothing at all. the problem here is that gap. that gap between hangar quality/size, the frivolous and the useful, between vanity and content,DLV and DLC. 

and the risk that adding a store like this, adds content in the game for those with the income and not the skills. pay to win, has not been addressed at all. selling weapons and items like this, is essentially an open statement, without comment.

nobody wants to pay for TES3 horse armor, ME2 weapons, or XBL snooki hair, it's an option. but putting a price tag on those options, means you can pay money to get that option. every time you play those games, it will push you to buy more things. ","1377994659"

1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1/2 cup butter
pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla


Preparation:

Preheat oven to 350F.
(In a mixer, if possble) Cream butter and sugar, then egg, then vanilla.
In separate bowl, sift together remaining dry ingrediants.
Add alternately dry mixture and buttermilk to creamed mixture.
Refrigerate, covering the bowl with plastic wrap, and chill for 8 hours.
Form dough into figure eights, handling the dough as little as possible.(I found the dough to be really sticky and somewhat difficult to handle.  The dough also spreads a LOT when baked so I would suggest rolling out the dough REALLY thin. I think my most successful ones were about 8″ long and less than 1/2 think.  I didn’t get a good handle on the size of the dough formations until the last batch.)

If you think you have a chance of lipping the jump, ollie. It'l give you more airtime. That said, you dont have to ollie off every jump. Especially the bigger ones- you should have the speed necessary to land them already and ollieing at that speed will throw you off balance. 

Onto jibs like rails and boxes, yea ollies are a good idea. This will prepare you for when you want to jib off natural terrain but need a foot or two of air to reach it, or when the feature your aiming for comes over the lip of the kicker and you have to ollie from the side onto it. ","1377994660"

I attend U of M and have found it extremely difficult to find a hat that can provide me with the means to properly represent my school and complement my outfit (instead of overwhelming it). This design plus the quality and subtleties that Ebbets brings to ballcaps in general would provide me (and others) just that. 

I believe about a year ago (or so) Ebbets had out a royal blue and maize Milawukee (maybe it was a different city) hat. I considered buying that cap, but it just didn't look right - the contrast was simply too stark. But this, this I would buy. This I would buy many times over just to ensure that I could wear it till the end of my days (even though I am sure that one cap would suffice). 


**The non-block font and non-maize provide a means for further appeal by allowing a window to go away from a Michigan association. This hat could go which ever way you choose. Even if you don't like college football (or you don't like Michigan), you could still where this hat. In the end, I think that very few can deny the appeal of this color scheme.","1377994661"

I recommend a body-centered form of therapy. Something like Somatic Experiencing. Reading Peter Levine's 'Waking the Tiger' and 'In an unspoken voice'. Excellent books that will help kickstart processes of transformation.

- Ranger ability 'Retreat' doesn't increase hang gliding speed anymore
- The crossbow's right mouse button ability now only does damage when charged
- You can now reset the day in inns only between 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.

Everyone follows a ""true"" path as they understand it unless you would like to believe that anyone is purposely choosing a path they know is ""evil"". I don't claim to be better informed because there's no way to define ""better"".

As to your verses. Note that these have nothing to do with OP's question and seem to be stemming from an inability to want to hear of a tolerant version of Islam.

To point out the specifics issues with your copy-paste version of Shariah:

1. You seem to have forgotten to read the next verse: ""But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed, Allah will turn to him in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" So indeed, the Hadd (can be interpreted to be) waived on repentance.

2. Again, it would be nice to read the entire subject matter than copy paste verses. If you'd read the relevant verses in the Quran on the matter, you'd know that firstly, there are [4 witnesses that are needed who have seen the act take place](http://quran.com/24/4-5) for anyone to be convicted of this. The witnesses must be of sound mind, good muslims (follow the laws of Islam) and respectable. But here's the catch, the Quran explicitly states that you [cannot spy on each other if you want to be a good muslim](http://quran.com/49/12). So in essence, the act of peeking into someone's privacy to view them having sex would by definition disqualify you from appearing as a witness to convict it. This would make any punishment for adultery an ineffective law. Why is it there you ask? 1) To show the gravity of how immoral the act is. and 2) Given that punishing for adultery was a common practice in Arabia at the time, this would be a neat way to kill the practice without actually killing it.","1377994676"

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","Each site has a pair of ""sister sites"" that are all a part of the kink.com group. If you join one of the sites you can get a discount for one of the sister sites for the first payment period, usually about 10-30% it seems depending on the site. For example if you join Public Disgrace, it's sister sites are Sex and Submission, Training of O, Ultimate Surrender, and Whipped Ass. These might change from time to time, but I haven't noticed it. 

The overall kink.com is like a main hub for all the other websites that allows for a ""one stop shop"" type of deal for every type of kink. Some websites might seem to be the same but there are differences.

For example you speak of the two gangbang sites. One is Hardcore Gangbang which is a typical 1 girl 4+ men kind of video. Then there is Bound Gangbang which incorporates bondage into the mix so the ""victim"" will be tied up, cuffed, or restrained in some matter. Depending on your kink this gives you two completely different sides of the same idea that will appease different people.","1377994682"

I agree that the outcry of ""moral collapse"" comes a little too often and a little too free, but being an Atheist doesn't mean that you dispose entirely of any notion of morality. In fact that is one of the biggest christian myths about atheists  that ""if you don't believe in god,  you should be raping stealing and murdering.""  Women, especially young women, are definitely overly sexualized by our media, it doesn't matter if you're a humanist or a calvinist, there are serious negative consequences to the exploitation of one entire half of our species. If we treated them like equals, and not like fuck toys, maybe our society would run smoother from a pragmatic point of view. Atheism is not hedonism, try to be good without god.","1377994685"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Back in elementary school I was out riding bikes with my buddy at this park near my house. This park was sunken in, almost like a crater, and was surrounded by these dirt hills inclining in towards the park which then turns into a small bit of grass and eventually into a man made cement river bed running through the center. So we think hey, lets ride down these dirt hills and go fast! We were stupid little shits back then.

So my buddy goes down first and he makes it down to the grass and brakes hard and slides because there's no real traction on the slippery grass. He yells for me to go down too, and without hesitation, I do. 

I was not prepared.

I gained speed speed way too quickly and I mentally froze, just cruising down the dirt, then onto to grass, and was nearing the fake cemented river. I tried to brake but it was too late, I collided hard into a big fake rock cemented into the ground near the river, my bike completely stopped and I was launched roughly 5 feet into the air, Dave Chapelle shitting explosion style, and was Supermand in the air completely horizontal when time stopped.

I then saw that I was either going to land into the shitty cement river bed and get all kinds of fucked up, or get lucky and land on the bridge. Thankfully, I did land on the bridge, with my chin smacking down first which caused my lower lip to become impaled by my upper front teeth. I had to get stitches and to this day it never fully healed, my bottom lip has this weird bulge I think because the stitches fell out. Shit was crazy because if I didn't land on that bridge I could have very well broken my neck.","1377994689"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt; the defense was much better at that time than it is now for the average team so that might take an effect as well.

Zone defense, etc today makes up for ""physical"" defense or whatever.

&gt; also, the 90's basketball was clearly more ""loosely"" called than today's game meaning that there was much more physical play and it wasn't as limited as today's game, not saying he couldn't have kept up but it would take a toll on him, as it would anyone.

Last two years have had the lowest FTA/G in NBA history (22.2 last year compared to 25-30 in the 90s). There may have been more physical play, but they still called plenty of fouls.

Plus, Lebron is one of the least injury prone players in history, I doubt the physical play would bother him that much if he were raised in the environment where that's expected.

Also, Lebron on defense with handchecking? Game over.

&gt; maybe one mvp, maybe some all nba first and seconds but that's as far as I would think he could go at that time

Assuming he played at last year's level or put up 2008-2009 Lebron stats with a similarly crappy team, he's beating MJ in 1996 (30.4/6.6/4.3 on 49.5% shooting) and 1998 (28.7/5.8/3.5 on 46.5% shooting) for the MVP award if you actually bothered to look at their statistics. Don't see why he can't beat Malone in 1997 or Robinson in 1995 either.

A few all nba first teams? He can't beat out Duncan for a spot? Grant Hill? Scottie Pippen three times? Barkley? Chris Mullin? C'mon man.

Maybe he wouldn't have won many titles because of MJ, but the rest of your post is hyperbolic BS.

"GrandTheftAutoV","t5_2t0xk","Eh, doesn't work *exactly* like that. Even mentioning the install base is a bit silly in itself since a vast amount of console owners are children who aren't allowed to own games like this, or adults who cant afford it.

Also, a good amount of GTA IVs sales came in 2009-2011 with the release of the downloadable content bumping regular IVs sales up to over 25 million units, also due to the YouTube community and Rockstar actually putting some decent advertisements out. Gaming is inarguably the largest entertainment outlet at the time, and with Call of Duty losing steam and the amount of advertising going into GTA, the chances of this game *not* breaking records is very low.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It was 2011. I was editing photos of the Libyan front line in a Cairo cafe. The pictures mostly featured fucked-out old Soviet tanks wrecked by NATO bombs. The front line at the time was near Ajdabiya. 

Anyway, so I'm editing, when I see a bunch of soldiers walking purposefully past the cafe window. ""Someone's fucked"" I thought and kept working. 

Next thing you know, they come right up to me, demand that I not move or touch anything and present to them my documents and all personal electronics. The soldiers were led by a plainclothed informant who saw my photos and assumed that I had compromising evidence of Egyptian military assets. 

One of the soldiers walked with me to the apartment where I stayed to get my passport. We returned to the cafe where they passed it around. Then one of them asked to see my iPod. 

The iPod at the time had 100 gigs of Libyan atrocity photos and videos taken by sources and citizen witnesses. Not all of them were clearly located in Libya. If they had found this, they would detain me while they searched the entire archive to see if any of it was evidence of SWAT malfeasance during the Egyptian revolution (many people had died at the hands of the cops.)

Fortunately, as they were looking at my passport, I was able to nudge my ipod cable behind a table, where it couldn't be seen. I told them I had lost it earlier and it was off They looked around the cafe for a way to connect the ipod to the computer but since there's a dearth of apple products in Egypt and possible ignorance, they gave up after a few minutes. 

The Libyans' tendency to paint their rebel flag everywhere saved me. Most of the pics on my computer featured it prominently. ""Libiyin, Libiyin, la Masriyin,"" I tried. They asked who I was writing for (freelance) before they reluctantly handed me my passport and told me to ""enjoy my stay in Egypt."" 

I went back to Libya shortly after and probably almost died in the siege of Tripoli but I really felt the most ""fucked"" during this incident.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Winnie liked to needle me.  About my clothes, about the movies I liked, sometimes about what I ordered when several of us went out for dinner.  

Now, I dressed well, in fact more than one girlfriend commented that I was a clotheshorse.  But Winnie always had to make an almost insulting comment, however thinly veiled.

I saw dozens of movies a year thanks to the art houses and the Cinematheque as well as a mail order rental house, but she'd find fault with my taste and ONLY with something I brought up in the group conversation.

Even my dining choices had to endure her analysis, and who really cares what someone else eats?  It was maddening, and I began to really hate seeing her across the table every week or so.

So I asked the mutual friend that introduced us what was going on, because he could see that she got on my nerves big time.  He said that every time he was alone with her, she talked about me, about what I did for a living, did I have a girlfriend (she'd seen me half a dozen times with different dates), but he just ignored it because two other times he'd fixed me up it had gone badly.

I'd missed it; her behavior was flirtatious, apparently, and I just thought she disliked me, and I her.  So, let the games begin.  Next time we all go out I make sure I am alone and sit right next to her.  My clothes are as neutral as the paint in a Swiss psych ward.  I wait for her to order and I have exactly the same meal right down to the salad dressing, wine and lemon in my water.

All during the meal I lean in to whisper, lightly touching her hand for emphasis, drawing attention to her when she makes a point and laughing appreciatively at every joke she makes.  I glance over at my friend just as the meal is almost over (we are planning a group exodus to see some film, who knows what) and his eyes are boring into mine as if to say ""WTF do you think you are doing?""  He likes to keep the dynamics of his group very neatly balanced and I may be about to screw them up.

The bill has come and gone, and everybody's conversation is winding down to leave but while two other women argue about something, I lean in again but this time I ask ""Would you rather see this movie or spend the night together?"" Just that blunt.  It hangs in the air, this question, and I watch the pulse in her neck begin lifting a link of her necklace at a much faster pace.  I do not blink or breathe, I do not say another word, and when she starts to drop her eyes to the clutch in her lap I lift her chin and make her look at me.  

All she says is ""My house.  Ten.""  And I can breathe again.  Because I hate her and I want her and I want to be a person who has predatory emotional sex and I have never felt like this before in my life.

She lets me in just after 10, and she's got wine poured and candles glowing and she's dressed in something that looks like it would blow off in a light breeze and she's wearing just enough perfume...Anais Anais, I think, that I am momentarily distracted from my reason for being there.  I see her framed in the soft pink light from the bedroom, and she lifts a glass to hand it to me.

I grab her wrist, set the glass down and moved in until I was standing over her.  She started to edge back a little but my arms went one around her waist and the other up her back until I hand my fingers gently but firmly entwined in her hair, then leaned over her and told her I was not in the mood for any seduction games, glasses of wine or small talk.  I am here for exactly one thing and that was to spend the night with her and to control her completely.  If she offered anything less than utter submission I would immediately walk out.  I am in charge.  Don't speak.

That was a long ten seconds. With my eyes looking into hers I picked her up, carried her to her bedroom and spent the next six hours immersed in lovemaking that was passionate, pissed off, fury driven and soul baring.

I never had the courage to be that way with a woman ever again, that controlling and dominating.  She seemed a little embarrassed the next few times we met, but treated me much better, and I felt better for the experience.  

Winnie, thank you for being the willow that bent in the wind of my tempest.  Without that spark of hate, passion would not have roared.","1377994702"

Yes, there is a demographic of males that do not self identify as gay but that do sometimes have sex with other men, the MSM crowd. IMHO those that are not in jail or otherwise prevented from having sex with a woman are in fact bisexual. Even, IMHO, the ones in prison that suck or get fucked are bi. MAYBE the str8 convicts that only get sucked off and/or fuck ass are (IMHO) heterosexual. 

Yes there is also a demographic of gay men that choose to not have sex at all. Is this who you meant by that? Or are you referring to something else?  

So it's a matter of degree I guess, not the act itself but rather the desire not only to try it once, but again and again and again, and really liking it. How else would you define being gay?","1377994704"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Though I agree that you think the American public should vote on certain occasions like Syria as it's offensive, and not a defensive initiative. However it is because of some archaic methods of system why it's not left to the Public. 

We established a constitution where as an elected official must represent his constituents in Congress. Those constituents no matter what party they elect must abide by the reps decision. This comes with agreement as that area such as a state. Was admitted to the Union through agreement has to abide by such regulations.

Secondly- the fact is in times of what is considered national interest and safety of the republic. A faster method of going to a defensive attack is set by the War Powers Act to allow the President immediate response, but has to get approval from congress in 90 days. Yes, the president does not even have to get a declaration of war from Congress. As fucked as that seems. It's upheld by the Supreme Court as legal.

Example a nuclear ICBM strike has occurred, and the President does not have time to call Congress for approval to strike back.

Third - like in Pearl Harbor attack. Congress met the very next day to declare war. Doing through public voting would cost valuable time to prevent further attacks, and such voting would have delayed the ability for Pacific operations to go on the offense against the Japanese such as Midway which was a turning point. General voting just flat out take to long. There would be debates etc... That's why you are supposed to vote in a good representative. Not two party clones that take bribes from lobbyists Lords of war like the political whores they are.

That's why you hear the White House spiel about Syria not only using chemicals as inhumane but also a threat to national security. That argument of national security in the best interest of the USA allows Obama to do what he wants without Congress approval.

The torque curve of a mod-motor is astounding! The 4.6 mod-motor adores boost as well. Throw on a centrifugal at 10 psi and they'll happily churn out 400+ to the wheels all day.

I actually wrote a (really bad) paper on Thai for my Phonology I class and I had a hard time even conceiving of the tones. Not to mention the fact that the two grammars I had disagreed about how many their were. A classmate of mine who was a non-native Mandarin speaker said that his experience was that after a certain point, the tonality ""clicks"" and ""just makes sense"" despite having felt so awkward at first. It sounds a lot like the initial difficulties I had with gender in Spanish, which now seem trivial (although sometimes I do use the wrong article still, but my Spanish is terrible). But I have a hard time thinking they were equivalently difficult, or would be across multiple subjects [speaking English and learning Spanish (or whatever language with gendered articles) vs. learning Thai/Mandarin (or whatever tonal language)], simply because tonality seems to lie farther away on the typology ""spectrum"" (or web or whatever, I'm not sure how that's done or if it's done) than gender. I don't know if this holds up, it's just my intuition, but it does seem that some aspects of typology would, in fact, be more ""foreign"" or would have gotten more solidly pruned in the acquisition phase, such that they would become more difficult to learn as an adult. 

*On the other hand*, I don't trust my intuitions as to *which* typological aspects would be more or less difficult, which is why I'm glad to hear someone has done the legwork.","1377994713"

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; We had to RENT Russian helicopters just to get our troops into Afghanistan.

 DND leased Russian made MI-17s to transport Canadian troops inside Afghanistan. Given the increased risk of ground travel, this gave considerably more protection to our soldiers moving from point a to point b. They were piloted by Canadian pilots. 

 This  measure was so that our forces would have immediate access to this transportation, as at the same time DND procured 26 F model and 6 Chinook D model heavy lift helicopters that were delivered early this year. 

 We also in 2007 ordered advance delivery of 8 C-17 Globemasters which are capable of carrying 200 soldiers and their equipment non-stop for 4000km. These began delivery late 2007 with all models being delivered by late 2008. 

 We also ordered three troop carriers that will begin deliver in late 2013. 

&gt; If we were situated anywhere else in the world we'd never get away with having such a low military budget.

We are about middle of the pack in terms of military expenditure/gdp for NATO. We spend a higher percentage than Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Netherlands.

 The problem is that being at par isn't going to help us catch up. Though out the 90's and into the the early 2000's the Liberal government issued huge cutbacks to military spending. With the cold war over, the military became the scapegoat for any budgetary shortfall. Then they sent our forces into Afghanistan with uniforms that didn't even match the terrain, 'armored' jeeps that were less protected against IEDs than a smart-car, and limited ability to maintain supply lines.

And if the game is going PVE, why is it that every balance change is sPVP focused? They even held back on balancing recently because PAX would house a PVP tournament, and they didn't want to rock the boat so close to the show.

PVE have glearing issues with balance that is being basically ignored, as ANet is hell bent on keeping the two as similar as possible. This so that PVE can act as a gateway and learning ground for PVP. Yet it is failing massively, because the PVE mobs do not act anything close to a competitive player and so the fights devolve to DPS races.

ANet are not making massive changes to sPVP simply because they want the game to be an esport. And so there needs to be a base framework that do not change often so that player skill can come forward. Or so at least seems to be their thinking.","1377994723"

"feedthebeast","t5_2v620","I would strongly suggest watching some videos by Direwolf20 on youtube.  He does a *fantastic* job of explaining how and why he's doing things, as well as knowing the modded minecraft scene as well as (and probably better than) pretty much anybody.  I would recommend either his ""Let's Play Season 5"" series, which is a bit more detail oriented with mod explainations but rather out-of-date (1.4.7), or ""Server Play Season 5"" series which is more recent (1.5.2) but less of a teaching tool.  Additionally, his ""Mod Spotlights"" are *fantastic* teaching tools about the basics of individual mods, but not really useful for understanding how the mods work together.  When you get curious about a specific function like ""how the hell do I make a mystcraft age"" or ""what does MineFactory Reloaded *do*"", check out the spotlight and he'll run you through the items, blocks and mechanics.

Additionally, I'd consider holding off for a few weeks as the 1.6 patches for many of the mods are getting ""close to release""™ and are looking like a pretty big leap forward.  As a new FTB'er, you may also want to steer clear of modpacks that include the mod ""gregtech"" as it increases the difficulty of *many* things, including vanilla mechanics.  If, once you get into non-gregtech FTB, you are bored by how easy things are, then you should consider a gregtech world.  (Personally, I don't like gregtech at all, but no matter what, I wouldn't recommend it for someone new to the scene.)

We're standing at the bus stop, and all of a sudden, my mom rolls up. She goes ""Hey, would you guys like to go get some Hardee's breakfast?"". Of course, this sounded incredible, but I knew we were both too high to function in front of my mom. So I'm like ""I have to meet (my other friend) to get my homework assignment done on the way to school."".

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;Mary Queen of Scots was never executed by Elizabeth I because she was nearly powerless in confinement and her death could easily have sparked a revolt. 

Mary, Queen of Scots actually *was* executed in 1587, on order of Elizabeth I. She was held prisoner for almost 20 years, but was eventually charged with plotting the death of Elizabeth I and executed. 

But otherwise, yes, Henry VIII had much to gain from executing his wives, and to him, it was completely necessary. He wanted to remarry quickly and set about producing a legitimate male heir. He fought for 8 years to try to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and that situation was only resolved with her natural death. Anne was much younger than Catherine when she fell out of favor with Henry, so a quicker method was desired.

As for the women you mentioned OP, Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort were not the threat; rather it was the men whose cause they were championing and that people would rally around. There's also scarce contemporary sources for both these women, so how much plotting they actually did can't be known for certain.

In addition to two of his wives, Henry VIII also ordered the execution of Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, and Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford (Anne Boleyn's sister-in-law). Both were charged with High Treason. 

However, there is a case of a woman being the figurehead of plotters looking to place her on the throne. Lady Jane Grey was a (Protestant) woman who was executed by Mary I (a Catholic) to prevent those who opposed a Catholic monarch rallying around Lady Grey (a second time, as her supporters did manage to place her on the throne for nine days before Mary I took over.) 

So essentially, in England the execution of noblewomen for treason began and ended with the Tudor family. Henry VIII kicked it off with Anne Boleyn, and his daughters both knocked one out themselves. To my knowledge, the preferred method prior to this was depositing troublesome women in an abbey or placing them under a sort of house arrest (Eleanor of Aquitaine, for example.) 

Edit: I use the term 'figurehead' here to refer to the individual in whose name people are plotting, and whom would eventually be placed in a position of power. 

Edit 2: Clarification and I spel gud.

She married a few years after this, definitely before she was 18, and returned to Afghanistan at around 20.

When she was 30 (in 2002), photographers found her again and took her picture again - [here they are side-by-side](http://s.ngm.com/afghan-girl/images/afghan-girl.jpg).  She'd had three daughters, and hoped that they would receive the education she never could.

That thread also seems to have been invaded by some of the /r/communism folks, based on the commenting patterns in the thread as a whole, so some of the upvotes that *do* exist, are coming from outside the community.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I've never been happy with the condition damage the pistol does. The bleed damage on the auto attack is pretty pathetic, though the ambush attack is *ok*. If you want to do condition damage d/d is far superior. the bleed from Death Blossom does 6 times as much bleed damage as the pistol auto attack (provided all 3 hits connect, which they usually do). The ambush attack for the pistol does only 2/3rds the damage that death blossom does.  
  
I've been using [this](http://www.guildhead.com/skill-calc#mckM) to get those numbers but they seem to agree with my experience. I realize that ranged weapons are generally less damaging than meele to compensate for the distance advantage, but the pistol just seems decidedly mediocre especially when you factor in that death blossom can hit up to 5 targets. Also I rarely see pistols used for their physical damage and I've never experimented with it either, but due to it's lack in popularity I suspect that even the physical damage is lackluster as well.  
  
It might be beside the point but I used a condition build and a combination of D/D and P/P to defeat liadri. I actually dealt the damage pretty evenly with each set too, but the pistols were mostly used to try to burn her down as quickly as possible by giving me a ranged attack option for when it was too dangerous to be close to her. Now that I've practiced the fight more, I suspect that I could do it without the pistols.","1377994741"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","Scott Snyder is above and beyond my favorite writer. I will mention that he's largely a horror writer, so that's probably a genre of comics you should enjoy going into his writing. His stuff also usually deals heavily with the characters, plot usually being secondary/exposing the inner-workings of the characters. He's also nice out the ass/nice as fuck in real person.

Snyder's best stuff is going to be his current Batman stuff, his long-running/still-going series American Vampire, and Batman: The Black Mirror. 

Current Batman is awesome if you don't like Morrison's Bat-God, or really Bat-God in general. This Batman is still smart, still almost unnaturally prepared, but not to that extent, and  the confidence of that preparedness is shown as a flaw of his. Court of Owls does a pretty good job of both giving you the ever-resourceful Batman, as well as showing that flaw. Death of the Family is a bit of a sore spot because it came at quite the unfortunate time. Batman #13 is, in my opinion, the best issue of the New 52, and the other issues are also quite good, but it came directly before Damian's death and so pretty much every impact of Death of the Family was thrown out the window to deal with that story. Also, other Bat-writers seemed pretty intent on forgetting Death of the Family ever happened. Snyder wrote quite a good Batman/Joker story, but anything else got ruined by other people. The two-issue Clayface arc was good, but not great. Snyder was pretty much buying time before Zero Year, probably. It's worth the money, and the Batman/Superman backup is pretty interesting, but it's not the best. Zero Year, going on now, is quite good, and closer to the level of quality that Snyder usually hits in an issue. The backups are usually pretty awesome, showing how Batman gained a skill referenced in the main story, and the art is good on those (Rafael Albequerque has done all of them, I believe). It's essentially New 52's Year One, without doing away with Year One. Yeah, some things are changed from that story, but it largely deals with things that aren't relevant/similar to Year One. Riddler/Edward Nigma plays a big role, and Snyder is writing him really well. Honestly, this arc can only get better. The series is going into Villains Month on #23, with Riddler #23.2 being a continuation/related to the overall story of Zero Year.

American Vampire is great because of how inventive it is, while still being a story about vampires. Even if you don't like vampires, try this out. It's a great story about humanity, betrayal, and love. Unfortunately, I can't give an arc-by-arc analysis like I did for his current Batman, but I can tell you that all of his arcs are good, for one reason or another. Both of the mini-series are good, with one dealing with Dracula, and another being about characters introduced during the series. Both of them tie into the main story (but not overly so), so it is recommended that you read them, but they're not required reading, just cool and recommended. A lot of people will tell you that he can't write endings, but American Vampire #33 (and Swamp Thing #18, but that's for another comment, another time) makes the opposite case. The Blacklist was probably already the best arc, but #33 cemented it. It was a really great look at all of the major players in the series. I can't attest to the quality of the recent anthology, as my LCS was stiffed by Diamond (i.e. they didn't get any copies), but the recent one-shot was actually quite good. If you do read American Vampire and win up liking Travis Kidd, The Long Road to Hell is only going to cement that feeling. This series is currently on hiatus, but will return in December with #35. 

Batman: The Black Mirror. Where do I begin with how awesome this story is? It's one of the best Bat-stories ever, and it's the best Dick-Bat story. The art (first arc with Jock, second with Francesco Francavilla) is **perfect** for the story. The almost straight horror take on Batman of Snyder's is stronger here than in his current stuff, and that's a large part of what makes this story freakin' awesome. The first arc deals with Dick struggling to fully assume the the Bat-mantle, and sort of his feelings of inadequacy. The villain is sort of a throwaway, but a cooler one than usually winds up out there. He's no Spook. Snyder's Batman stuff is pretty focused on Gotham and its history, and that arc shows some cool things that have to do with the city's past. Really, that arc shows how good Snyder is at writing psychological horror. The second arc (for the life of me, I can't remember if this one is Black Mirror, or if it's Hungry City) is...well...super-fuckin'-amazeballs-spectacular. It deals with the Gordon family, particularly the relationship between a long-gone, just-returned, possibly-serial-killer James Gordon Jr. and Jim Gordon. There are numerous amazing moments from that arc, and you should not miss it. Seriously, it's fucking awesome. Awesome. The trade collects both Black Mirror and Hungry City, with some cool stuff in the back like concept art (while not something I usually care for, Jock and Francavilla are two of my favorite artists) and a script for one of the issues. On second thought, I believe Hungry City is the first arc, and Black Mirror is the second.

Other things that Scott Snyder has written that are really awesome (there's that word again) are Severed (story about a serial killer), Swamp Thing (really cool story that heavily involves the Rot, the Green, and the Red and has some great relationship stuff with Alec Holland and Abigial Arcane), and The Wake (currently on #3, really awe-mazing story about killer mermaids and underwater theories and/or myths).","1377994742"

Joel has no basis to understand any of this, however. That still gives the finale impact for me.

A guy came up to my friend and started complimenting his shoes and asking if he could try them on (He was wearing knock-offs of a $250 pair of Nike airs). My friend kept saying no until eventually it was clear the guy wasn't going away until he let him try one on. So my friend took off one shoe. The stranger started yelling about how comfortable it was and how great of a shoe it was. Then his 8 friends showed up. I was texting at the time and one of them took my phone out of my hands and said they just wanted to look at it. They were all 20+ and we were just skinny little kids. We weren't gonna try to fight our way out of the situation or even try to intimidate them. I started asking for my friend's shoe back and demanding they gave my phone back. Which was dumb. They didn't want to punch a 14 year old in public so they came up to me, crouched down to eye level, slapped me across the face and told me to shut up. This happened a few times and even once with a bag of tabacco. I'll skip to my friend taking his other shoe off. The first stranger was wearing both of my friend's shoes at this point. His best friend, Pink earring guy (That's the name the cops had given him because they had dealt with him before) was shoving and slapping me and telling me to shut up and 7 other guys were standing around us laughing at us. The first stranger gets off our little bench and walks around to try out the shoes then bolts and his friends start laughing. No one at the bus stop cares. They start walking down the bus stop, we follow them asking for my phone back. Some of their girlfriends and one of their kids shows up. I tell my friend to come inside the shopping center to find a payphone to call our parents. I start walking in and he doesn't follow me. Out of nowhere, one of the dickheads kicks me in the back. So now they've robbed us, assaulted us, taken our means of calling the cops and our parents and my friend was now out of sight. That was the ""Well I'm fucked"" moment - when I couldn't see my best friend and there were people around who wanted to cause us physical harm. I found him eventually. Turns out they liked him more than they liked me and they gave my phone back to him. He got to keep the shoes of the first guy. They were $90 custom converse. My friend's knock-offs cost his mum about $30. They cost the robber 2 years in jail.","1377994746"

I saw this a long time ago right when it came out. It was at a New Year's Party. The people I was with must have watched this 4 or 5 times in a row. I mean they were absolutely in love with it. Surprise: I wasn't. It wasn't funny. It wasn't interesting. I thought it was stupid and it started my sheer amazement at the amount of hype Joss Whedon generates. He is the master self-promoter. He has a special ability to take good actors, use them to create a turd, and have the Whedon Army worship that turd and enforce strict Whedon Worship throughout the land. And strangely I'm actually considering watching this again because it's been so long and I distinctly remember not liking it but I've forgotten exactly why.

I hope that the game stays open ended since end game content was brought up.
How cool would it be for future sequels and DLC to show more cities or locations? 
Obviously this is in new york around Christmas time. How cool would it be to play this in several different cities like Chicago, Miami, Atlanta etc?

Since it seems to be almost MMO based, this could almost literally be a never ending game that would be massively popular with not just the RPG or adventure crowd, but the MMO crowd as well. 

Would definitly be competition for the new ""Destiny"" game bungie is releasing. At least this is on PC so it will reach a much large audience than bungies new game. ","1377994758"

He clicks on a leaf, and then on a spider. the story doesn't progress, nothing really happens. But! Interaction with the world/characters occurs. The genre is point and click, and it's good at what it is.  
Imagine a PaC game where you can only click on 1 thing on the whole screen, and only then the game progresses.  
Thats a crappy PaC, right? Gamewise yes. Add objects and ways to interact with the world, and it becomes better. As a game, of it's genre (!).  

Botanicula says its a quest, and plays marvelously, as a quest. And the game aspects of it, only add to the experience. It cannot be made a movie (a good one atleast). And that's why its a good game.  

In Bioshock, Combat was so horrible, that i think they should've just added a way to skip it. It's a book/movie in game form. With the emphasis on movie. Yes, story, yes writing. But there's no gameplay in the game. Thus it's a bad game.  

I'm not saying bioshock is a bad experience (for me, maybe, but not for those who like those types of stories). I'm saying Bioshock is a bad game. And btw, A. Sessler gave it a 5/5. Which is bullshit. It's not a 5/5 (horrible gameplay!).  


Again, interactivity is good. But gameplay is what makes a game. Choosing is cool, story changes are cool (i didn't notice the big difference though). But, Gameplay=Game. Interactivity=Game. Story=movie.  

Bioshock would've worked better as a heavily casualised game, rather than a crappy FPS with a good story.  


P.S. Focus on the gameplay makes games. I'm trying to draw a line here.","1377994759"

Though I agree that you think the American public should vote on certain occasions like Syria as it's offensive, and not a defensive initiative. However it is because of some archaic methods of system why it's not left to the Public. 

We established a constitution where as an elected official must represent his constituents in Congress. Those constituents no matter what party they elect must abide by the reps decision. This comes with agreement as that area such as a state. Was admitted to the Union through agreement has to abide by such regulations.

Secondly- the fact is in times of what is considered national interest and safety of the republic. A faster method of going to a defensive attack is set by the War Powers Act to allow the President immediate response, but has to get approval from congress in 90 days. Yes, the president does not even have to get a declaration of war from Congress. As fucked as that seems. It's upheld by the Supreme Court as legal.

Example a nuclear ICBM strike has occurred, and the President does not have time to call Congress for approval to strike back.

Third - like in Pearl Harbor attack. Congress met the very next day to declare war. Doing through public voting would cost valuable time to prevent further attacks, and such voting would have delayed the ability for Pacific operations to go on the offense against the Japanese such as Midway which was a turning point. General voting just flat out take to long. There would be debates etc... That's why you are supposed to vote in a good representative. Not two party clones that take bribes from lobbyists Lords of war like the political whores they are.","1377994760"

When we were young (I was maybe 8 years old), my ~4 year old brother stumbled into a yellowjacket nest.  They all swarmed out and started stinging him, and he was in too much pain to move.  So, I grabbed him and ran.  We both got stung to shit, and finally got to our house.  We got inside, but there were dozens of yellowjackets still in our clothes and stinging.  I had the presence of mind to strip us down and throw our clothes out the door, and the SECOND they got outside a massive swarm of yellowjackets attacked them because of the pheremones.

My brother and I both ended up riding and ambulance and spending time in the hospital (I had 50+ stings, he had close to a hundred and almost died), and my family said the yellowjackets were still attacking the clothes 3 or 4 hours later. ","1377994760"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;Ha. Yes, please teach me about the Bible. Clearly you have mastered it. 

I'm going to teach you something else about the bible: **you can't master it**. No matter how right you think you are, no matter how much you have studied its contents, a billion Christians will disagree with what you say about it. Your education is kind of a joke, considering how much opinion, picking and choosing, and making shit up is part of being a leader in a church. Does that sound like a god planned it? Does that sound like god talks to and favors certain Christians? Fuck no. Your religion is a joke and its punch line is hurting its sheep.

&gt; Secondly, I am a ""full pastor."" 

I'm sorry, I thought ""student pastor"" meant that you were a student. You see, it's hard to tell you guys apart from just ordinary Christians (and much harder to tell different kinds of pastors apart) because even your bishops are bad at defending your faith and you all display the same misunderstandings (about atheism, for example). You'd think that a pastor would be better at this than an ordinary Christian, wouldn't you?

&gt;In fact, Ecclesiastes says there's nothing new under the sun. 

Computers are new. Your bible tells lies. You should stop accepting what's in the bible and start thinking skeptically about what's in there instead.

&gt;Finally, Jesus defended the truth that was being corrupted by arrogant people who hated him and his teachings...

Oh yes, I remember the story about him killing defenseless trees, pigs and breaking out the whip to go threaten to hit (and probably hit) people to get them off the temple grounds. Such a good example to us all.

&gt;Fourth, call atheism whatever you want. It shaped your worldview. To deny that is to just be obtuse to try and prove your point.

Man, I really encourage you to read up on what atheism is. Atheism is just the answer to the question whether one believes if there are any gods. It only informs my worldview on that particular issue. Seriously, **you look uneducated about the part of the population that you should want to know the most about**. Atheism is not a worldview and I have not told you a lot about my actual world view (I'm open to questions, though, I'm sure you are very interested). I'm probably more influenced by humanism and a skeptic approach to life.

&gt;And, by your own admission you're trying to show me the error of my ways that is not consistent with your view. 

Notice how I'm not doing this to children, but I engage adults. I assume that you are an adult, but I have heard of child preachers before. Apparently anyone can teach others about the bible (so why won't you let me? :-(  )

&gt;Ill turn the other cheek when it is time. If you think discussion on reddit is cause to turn the other cheek, you've got thin skin.

You are the one who seems ready to run away, not me. I used to think pastors and priests were intimidating, but that was before I actually debated one. 

Also, I noticed that you haven't apologized to me about all the faulty assumptions you made before. I thought Christians were supposed to be humble and shit. I am shocked, *shocked* that you behave just like someone that has no book of morals to tell them how to act in civil society, how to keep slaves and how to give away your belongings.

What does the bible teach about turning the other cheek? When is it time? Do you follow the commands of your god only when you aren't arguing on the Internet? When you feel like it? I'm actually curious.","1377994763"

This guy was insane and he had this habit of leaving his slippers outside his door and my dad got so sick of him that right before we moved out, my dad screwed his slippers down to the floor.

Have a church or ""social"" wedding but not a legal one, legal weddings are only designed to be monetary insurance if you break up. I am wholely against state sanctioned marriages and the fact that women are so ""urged"" to get married... its a fucking sham.

If I find a good translation, I'll post it.  

-----  
So fann de han Ole Johan,  
langt burte i Håsteinshagen.  
Der låg han og rotna og brann,  
med solsteiken rett i magen.  
Og magen var grønn og blå,  
av steinklaka gorr og slim.  
Og flugor og kvitmakk små,  
aula i yrjande stim.  
  
Spyflua grønn og feit,  
la sine egg i skinnet,  
og ålekvite småmakkar beit  
seg gangar og hol der inne.  
Ei rotte stakk tranten ut,  
-kva svarten var no og sjå?  
Ho var som ei blodgorra klut,  
med blankslimut hale på.  
  
Og augo hans Ole Johan,  
var berre ei slimut glye  
som nedover kinnet rann,  
so sleip som ei slimut spye.  
Og nasa eit blodraudt sår,  
der benpipa lyste bleikt.  
For rotta ho var der i går,  
og åt seg so feit ei steik.  

Og lippa for kjøt var rein,  
og gliste med kvasse tenner,  
som illkvite stakk og skein,  
som marssol på frosne fenner.  
Og teven stod kjukk ikring,  
denne blaute flytande kropp,  
og kråka sat rundt i ring,  
og skratta med høge hopp.  

Så tok de han Ole Johan,  
og la han på fire påla.  
So bar dei han fire mann,  
mens kråkene skratta og skråla.  
Mykje ta skrotten flaut vekk,  
og mykje kvarv burt som eim,  
og mykje i spyflua gjekk,  
men beina kom heile heim.  ","1377994782"

I'm doing my best to learn/stay informed on the situation. Most of the people that talk to me on Reddit clearly have no idea what they're talking about

They described a ""napalm-like substance"". Not disagreeing, just saying thats the buzzphrase for the main report yesterday

&gt;My question is why do we only have eyewitness with no images of the damage at the school? Why is there no one in the videos that seems to be in actual pain, where are the routine sterile gauze wrappers strewn about as the workers try to help bandage these injured 

I'm not sure what descriptions/footage you seen...but nobody has described actual fire causing the burns, at least not that I know of. Does ""incindiary agent"" specifically mean ""fire""?...BUT All the footage I've seen showed victims covered in white powder &amp; in extreme agony as the BBC crew in the area documented the direct aftermath....people clearly showing the symptoms of severe burns

Found a rope swing hanging from a tree.  It looked old, but it was a rope and I was an adolescent boy.  I jumped onto that rope, feeling the fibers in my hands.  I was swinging from it, and then I looked up and realized I was hanging on nothing but air.  I seemed to float, everything slowed down around me.  Then I hit the ground and a thick 20-foot rope landed on my face as I tried to recover the wind that was knocked out of me when I landed on the roots below.  I was laying there for a bit.","1377994786"

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","Hey! I posted a while back on /r/warhammer about my thoughts on the necrons. I was shit on, primarily by DBJ. 

So, I don't know if you read the previous codex or not, but it makes sure to say very specifically that Chaos is anathema to the c'tan, and that it was the only thing that could stop them. In the new codex, it conveniently forgets to mention this. In addition, look at the text box on page 40. under the C'Tan entry, look at the names that are given. 

Mephet'ran the Deciever
Aza'gorod the Night Bringer
Iash'uddra the Endless Swarm 

Don't those titles sound kind of familiar? Kind of like 3 gods that should have been around at that time period? 

How about on page 6, under ""The Coming of the C'Tan"" where it gives you the 'origins' of the C'Tan. The account held in Solemnace it is very similiar to the original one. That they just happened to find them eating a star. *But*, then it gives a new, possible alternate account. "" tells rather that the raw hatred that the Necrotyr held for the Old Ones sang out across space, acting as a beacon that the C'Tan could not ignore."" Sounds kinda chaotic. Not only that, do you know where that account comes from? The Book of Mournful Night, kept in the innermost sanctum of the Black Library. The same library that's entire purpose is to document Chaos.  

You know the vessels that the C'Tan are kept in? Not the Necrodermis shells, rather the Tesseract Labyrinth. The same device used by the Grey Knights to capture and contain demons. 

Page 7. Biotransference, first sentence, second paragraph. ""As Szarekh watched the C'Tan feast on the life essence of his people"". Here is an example of the C'Tan feasting on souls. This was their sole purpose in the previous codex, but it no longer stated as their ambition. This brings me to my next point. Why do the C'Tan hate the Old Ones so much? It states that they lost a war in the past against them. The Old Ones had 'succeeded'. They had created the Webway. The perfect means of travel for their species. Chaos couldn't touch them. They needed to cross over to real space, in order to breach the webway through the gates. In order to do that, they need someone to give them permission. Que the Necrotyr. 

There are a few other things I think I've forgotten but I posit that the new codex was written specifically to suggest that the C'Tan are in fact Daemons of Chaos that manipulated the Necrotyr into causing the downfall of the Old One society. ","1377994788"

I could only go as fast as the guy infront of me, who yes was clearly going too slow.  It's a two lane road, with a lane going each way. 

So the guy in front of me comes to a near complete stop before turning on a side street. Since i didn't want to rear end him, i too slowed down. Well that did nothing but further aggravate the impatient driver behind me, who merged into the empty oncoming lane to pass me, gunning his engine to the extent he easily spent a gallon of fuel, flipped me off.

What was really going on was that I was feeling POWERFUL while being powerless--as you can imagine, this didn't workout. It's a miracle that I didn't drink over this situation and was able at that time to survive the breakup of that ill-considered romance and stay sober for the next 15 years.  The problem, of course, was that after breaking up with her I had essentially turned my AA meetings into Junior HS.  I was so obsessed with her, and what she was doing that I had to totally change where I went to meetings.  Horrible.

The police dept and DA's office get different budgets for staff, salary, and how they spend their time.  They also report to different bureaucracies, so the DA gives no fucks how many hours/days/weeks the detective spent on the case, and likewise, the cops give no fucks how much time is wasted by the DA.

Either way, I agree that it is net more expensive to the taxpayer to keep the status quo than it would be to purchase and equip all SJPD officers with lapel cameras that were recording for each and every interaction with the public.  The fear of officers being held accountable, combined with the realization by some asshat lawbreakers that they are on obvious camera would help to tone down the hostility and showboating that happens on both sides of law enforcement encounters, resulting in fewer instances of uses of force, complaints against officers, and subsequent legal settlements when the cops are proved to be acting out of line.","1377994795"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I'm a social worker and research suggests pretty clearly that 12 step programs simply do not work for the overwhelming majority of people - atheists and theists alike.

My interpretation of the studies, leads me to conclude that the reason for the failure is the requirement to accept that a ""higher power"" is in control of your life.   People who refuse to accept this step are told they will die.

How can an alcohol or other addict recover when they can easily blame their entire situation on a ""higher power.""  It completely obviates the most essential step of recovery - taking personal responsibility.    

Yes alcoholism is a disease, just like diabetes is a disease.   If eating or drinking behavior don't change both can lead to serious medical complications including death.   The ONLY way to change behavior of this sort is to accept that you are responsible for your fate.

There are several successful non 12 step programs and interestingly enough, some of them teach moderation instead of total abstinence (another really bad idea in AA).   If an alcoholic knows he can have a beer every once in a while as long as that's it, he won't feel that having that beer is the same as a total relapse and is less prone to resume heavy drinking.  He does no more damage than the diabetic who allows himself a piece of chocolate cake every once in a while.","1377994795"

Solving, first thing you've got to do is get a mass of one atom of carbon 12. Well we know that it weighs 12 amu from the mass number. So convert it to kilograms with the following value: 

1.66053892*10^-27 [kg] / 1 [amu]

So plugging and chugging should give you: 

1.993*10^-26 [kg] approx. 

Plug all of your values into the Brogile Equation solved for velocity and you should get a final answer of:


0.082 [m/s] approx. 

----------

I can't believe I fucked up my units, but I figured I'd post the methodology of solving this type of problem incase anyone shows up with a similar question. ","1377994806"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I'm sorry. I don't have any free market examples because we don't have a free market. Most suggestions regarding free markets are merely assumptions based on logic and reasoning without clear examples to go by. I don't believe most examples based on ancient history are applicable to today's economic bigness.

Agreed. Monsanto and other huge corporations that swallow smaller corporations for breakfast will have power in any economy, with or without government OR state. The only difference is that in an economy existing within a government that has laws against bribery of government officials, they're forced to spend more money up front to get around the law. That is, until they build the framework required to install their very own public/private revolving door. They will do this regardless of any situation that might stand in their way.

Are you suggesting that without government we'd have no limited liability, crony capitalism, corporatism?

Because I think that's something we'll have in any society.

How would monopolies cease to exist in a free market? 

They certainly existed in the very limited regulation economy of the late 19th, early 20th centuries. 

Less regulation for giants means they'll come together to corner markets and establish monopolies.

Reputation ***is*** king in a free market economy. That's ***exactly*** why my argument makes sense. That's ***exactly*** why the arbiters will make sure to do a good job and side with the corporations that buy their services in the majority of cases.

Your insurance providers have no say in a dispute you try to bring after you signed a contract agreeing to allow the corporation to pick the arbiters. If you want to buy their products or services, you must *first* sign the contract that has those arbitration stipulations built into it. 

You don't have a choice in deciding who the arbiters are after you sign that contract. That's why arbitration is built into every contract imaginable today. Corporations limit their risks of losing disputes by forcing anyone that buys their product to sign the contract that eliminates virtually all possibilities of recourse against them.

&gt; You inferred Jesus divinity was the dominate ideology of early Christianity. I've provided evidence from your source to the contrary. I'm not sure what's that hard to understand about that.

Now you have clarified that the number of councils and the length of the period over which they occurred are an indication that belief in Jesus' divinity was not the dominant view of the early church.

I don't see why, because, again, the existence of a debate does not obviously indicate the nonexistence of a dominant position.

Further, the question of whether Jesus was divine was settled at Nicaea. The second council, at Constantinople, reasserted the Nicene creed in opposition to lingering Arianism, but also condemned emerging heterodox teachings. These teachings did not call into question Jesus' divinity; rather, they assumed that he was divine and raised doubts about his full humanity. Similarly, the focuses of later councils were increasingly subtle questions about how Jesus' divine and human natures were interrelated. All tacitly assumed and affirmed his divinity.

So... just what is it about this long string of councils that is supposed to make me doubt that belief in the divinity of Jesus was not the dominant view of the early church?","1377994819"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","A book you should read, which is a classic, is E.R. Dodds's *The Greeks and the Irrational*.  It goes into the development of the concept of soul (*psyche*) in Greek thought.  

You seem to ascribe to the ""lay public"" the belief that ghosts are entities which are absolutely separate from the body, and you think of this as a sort of folk substance dualism -- but such a conception isn't universal.  Think of the Egyptians and their mummifcation practices.  Did they *really* think that preserving the body of the dead would help him in the afterlife?  Wasn't it *the soul* that would be judged in the afterlife, and not the body?  The answer, according to Dodds's analysis, is that such questions are irrelevant when it comes to thinking about the Egyptians' conception of death and afterlife.  Like most cultures, the Egyptians didn't make a distinction between the body of the dead and his soul.  There was just sort of a mismash of concepts, with no logic.  If you had asked an Egyptian priest wether the preservation of the dead king's organs was a literal or symbolic act, you would likely have been met with an incredulous stare.  Indeed there couldn't have been any logic governing these practices because logic, of the kind we're concerned with here, hadn't been invented yet!  According to Dodds, the absolute separation of body and psyche was an invention of ""the Homeric poets"".          

&gt;When the archaic Greeks poured liquids down a feeding-tube into the livid jaws of a mouldering corpse, all we can say is that he abstained, for good reasons, from knowing what he was doing; or, to put it more abstractly, that he ignored the distinction between corpse and ghost -- he treated them as ""consubstantial."" To have formulated that distinction with precision and clarity, to have disentangled the ghost from the corpse, is, of course, the achievement of the Homeric poets.  There are passages in both poems which suggest that they were proud of the achievement, and fully conscious of its novelty and importance.  They had indeed a right to be proud; for there is no domain where clear thinking encounters stronger unconscious resistance thatn when we try to think about death.

And you can see how this tiny advance in rationality by Homer planted a seed, as it were, that would flower with the later philosophers.

With that in mind, I don't think it's accurate to see the lay public's belief in ghosts as a latent substance dualism.  There's just not enough there to make a comparison.  The lay public's belief is magical and pre-rational, whereas substance dualism belongs to a system of rationality.  To make an obvious point: it wouldn't make sense to say that you witnessed your dead grandfather's *res cogitons* walking down the hallway, because *res cogitons* is, by definition, that which isn't extended in space and therefore *can't* walk down hallways.  Similarly, if you ask a person who sincerely believes he sees ghosts just what *substance* those ghosts are made of, you will likely be met with an incredulous stare.   ","1377994825"

But after a while, you look around, you see cafes, windmills, tulips, you begin to learn this new language. And you think, this isn't so bad. There's nothing 'wrong' with it, it's just different, special. And that's what autism is.

 **Edit,** it seems my Mum is roughly quoting an author who pretty much said the same thing but with more depth. So I guess the credit would go to a woman named 'Emily Pearl Kingsley'.

Now my dad is an ex military man and I knew he would be at work until 5pm. It's around 12pm so I'm golden. I'm in my room grabbing stuff and I hear the front door open. Well fuck it can only be my dad since it's just me and him.  So I hide under my bed. For 11 hours.  When he went to sleep and I knew he was out I grabbed dirty work clothes and jumped out of my second story window to go get my car. 

I got to my friends house and quickly changed and got in my car to head home.  I pull up and the lights are out. Sweet he didn't wake up. So I unlock the door walk in and boom the lights turn on.  Fuck. 


In the end he knew I was home the whole time. He had come home on lunch to grab some paperwork he left at home for work but he stayed to see how long I would last.  I ended up not getting in trouble because he said freakin out for 11 hours was punishment enough.    But still I thought I was fucked for a long time. ","1377994828"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;""I actually really enjoy these discussions. I love philosophy but it's rare I get to really discuss it. I especially enjoy the Münchhausen trilemma""

You and me both, brother. Philosophy is absolutely fascinating and the Münchhausen Trilemma is a classic philosophical problem that just stimulates the deepest thoughts one can engage in when discussing epistemology. I am happy to be discussing this with you.

&gt;""there is a fairly reasonable chance you could convince me to abandon coherentism. By itself it wouldn't really convince me God exists,""

Oh certainly, I understand. We are talking about epistemology here, and if you were to agree with mine you could look up something like ""Foundational Reliabilism"". Plantinga has his own model of Foundational Reliablism called ""Reformed Epistemology"" and he argues as to why God is a properly basic belief because he is what makes our faculties reliable to begin with and he orients our road to truth. I like Plantinga's argument there and I agree with him, but I prefer to use the moral route, and how God orients our moral experience and our existential experience. This is the part where I think I could persuade you to believe in God in a properly basic way, and you would be totally justified in your belief in God and objective moral values in the exact same way you would be justified for your belief in reality itself. But of course that is another topic, as we are strictly talking about epistemology at the moment.

&gt;""However, in the objective reality we both share, it is only possible that either Islam is true, Christianity is true, or neither are true. ""

Aha, you are correct you, you got it. We can say they both cohere, but we can't say that they are necessarily true, only possibly true. **However, this is when we run into the nature of necessity**. If we apply Modal Logic to Coherentismic arguments for Islam or Christianity, their necessary conclusions must exist in all possible worlds, and therefore it definitely leads to contradictions if we accept Coherence Theory.

&gt;""The statement ""I am a Man"" is true for one reality and false for the other. ""

Yup, you got it. In Modal Logic terms, the statement ""I am a Man"" is only true in some possible words, as that proposition is a contingent fact. That proposition is only true in some possible worlds, not all possible worlds. But the claims made by Christianity and Islam entail necessary claims, which would mean if they are correct then they must be true in all possible worlds, but since one is true in one possible world, and the other is true in the other possible world, therefore they can't both be true in all possible worlds. This is the primary problem Coherence Theory runs into, it undermines the nature of necessity, and it leads to contradictions.

&gt;""The important question then becomes ""what is the truth for the reality I experience?""""

Ah now that is a philosophical question right there. That is precisely the type of question that science is incapable of answering, it is literally logically and epistemically impossible to use the scientific method to answer that question. This is where philosophy is absolutely necessary. I think that truth must be God, and later on in the discussion I can show you how God is the ontological foundation for all philosophical truths (metaphysics, ethics, epistemology).

John 14:6

Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life"".

1. I am the way = the source of all ethical truths and ethical duties. **He is the ontological foundation for Ethics**.

2. I am the truth = the source of all wisdom and knowledge. **He is the ontological foundation for Epistemology**.

3. I am the life = the source of all metaphysical truths. **He is the ontological foundation for Metaphysics**.

Only Jesus Christ makes such claims as these, and he is the source of all philosophical truths.

EDIT: had to add that quick notion about how science can't answer metaphysical claims.","1377994830"

How about Israel, they are known to have used white phosphorus on civilians, which is a war crime - should we take out their WMD too - or is this logic only good if we are taking out our enemies, or our enemies allies?

Be assured, that such effects were not produced without many love-charms, incantations, and magic wheels.”

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I went an all boys high school. Outside class, I didn't really hang out with the kids in my school, mostly the kids from my hometown. I was terrible with girls- I didn't deal with them day-to-day, so I really put it on a pedestal so to speak. To make things worse, after high school I went to flight school, which is incredibly male-dominated. The awkwardness continued. 

Eventually I came to see that flying wasn't for me and transferred to an art school. At the same time I decided to try and get in shape, and my confidence improved. The male/female ratio was MUCH better at my new school. The girls were also considerably more laid back than the chicks in my hometown.

I did well on all my projects and a couple girls started wanting to partner up with me on group assignments. I ""learned the ropes"" when it comes to talking to women pretty quick and I went on to do very well with girls from there on out. I've been in a great relationship now for years and couldn't be happier.

edited to add: You can look at requirements for applied [here](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/undergrad/applied-statistics) and for general [here](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/undergrad/statistics). For applied, you basically substitute the math classes in the general stats major for classes in your chosen field (in your case, Econ). You also take the shorter/easier mathematical statistics courses (130 instead of 131), BUT you are required to take statistical computing, which is probably the most useful class in the major, but also the most tear-inducing.

The power of Congress to declare war implies the founders wanted CONGRESS that decides when to pick a fight and against whom.

I stopped producing milk after 5 weeks, despite continuing to try the pump and having him latch on.

The Dell U2713HM uses an aggressive matt coating making pixels blurry, has cross hatching issues and build quality as well as quality control at Dell suck. The Asus PB278Q is superior but uses PWM dimming which some people are sensitive to.  

The Korean monitors have some build quality issues as you mentioned but are okay for the majority of users. Problems that **could** occur:  
* dead pixel(s) (perfect pixel version is just a way to make more money)  
* stuck pixel(s) (could be fixed in theory)  
* backlight bleeding (could be fixed to some degree but this is the biggest problem)  
* no warranty if you purchase one from eBay (although the sellers give you one year, but I haven't read of a single return after roughly 100 pages on OCN)

Keeping secrets goes along with persecution.  There is a huge difference between non-advertising and keeping secrets.  Low key, yes.  Secrets and silence, no.

Of course, there were some wild antics by Michael, but the staff reacted pretty realistically which made the scenes so cringeworthy to watch in a good way. Michael also didn't really come off as an idiot, but someone who was socially stunted.

However, the Homer Simpson effect seemed to take over future seasons with an example being Michael driving into a lake because the GPS told him to. The staff also started becoming increasingly cartoonish and dumb for some reason.

Especially Kevin. I liked him in the earlier seasons when he was the awkward guy with a bit of a perverse sense of humor as opposed to just turning into a retard. 

I did like the last couple of episodes of The Office though, since they seemed to start toning things down instead of trying to force other characters to fill the void left by Michael Scott. It was those few episodes where it seemed like they were ready to set their own path as opposed to the horrible attempts with Robert California, Nellie, and Andy.","1377994863"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","About 3 years ago when I was out camping with my friends, a white pickup truck pulled up to our campsite. Three guys inside, start talking to our friends (they were really drunk) and hitting on them. The girls get in the truck with these guys, so me and my friends figure it's time to tell them to leave. We do, they leave, all seems well. As the night rolls on all my friends proceed to get hammered, and everyone passes out. I stay up tending to the fire, when all of a sudden I see headlights. The white truck pulls up to our site, only this time the entire bed of the truck is filled with about 15 guys. They circle around me, some of them with bats, one guy had a pipe, another guy had a knife. I knew I was dead, and that it was going to be painful.

If there's one *particular* sin that you're trying to mumble so incoherently that the priest won't understand you, that's a problem with your own intention - as if you wanted to get credit for ""saying it"" in confession, but were unwilling to let the priest *hear* you say it.

"pittsburgh","t5_2qhrn","Depends what you want to do.  If you want to do biology, philosophy, engineering, or linguistics, Pitt is amazing.  We offer a ton of different language options and have intensive study programs abroad.  It's also really easy to get involved in research and there are a lot of efforts to get undergrads in labs.

If you want to do anything quantitative, go elsewhere.  Pitt's CS program is decent but there's this obsession with object-oriented programming that consumes virtually the entire department.  You will never touch anything but Java with some *very* rare exceptions.  The statistics department is also horrifically underfunded to the point where an upper level class that's supposed to be 30 people is 60 because Pitt won't give the department an extra penny.  The math department is pretty good but you'd be better off going to a school that covers the same material more rigorously.

There's also a lot of red tape.  You have to pay for any additional credits over 18, unlike many other schools that will just make your advisor sign off on them.  You also can't take classes at a community college once you hit 60 credits and anywhere but Pitt after 90.  Your wallet will hate you for it.  It can also be really hard to find motivated peers who legitimately enjoy doing the work for your classes even at the upper levels.  There's a noticeably large number of students in certain departments that are going through the motions for the sole purpose of coming out with a high-paying job.

You also won't be able to take too many classes that aren't in big lecture halls, and that may be true if you're a member of an underfunded department like computer science or statistics.  And it will impact your graduation time.","1377994878"

Exactly.

I never meant to imply that Guild wars is a bad game. But it is different. Their content is different because the game is different. Guild wars doesn't attempt to provide a varied endgame with pve and pvp, it doesn't attempt to keep you playing. What it does is release events so people who don't play all the time pick the game up again with maybe two week breaks.

Personally I wish for a game with WoWs endgame and I don't believe a B2P model can sustain that.

Artillery is supporting on the Regiment/ Brigade level and is capable to fire long range fire and cover a much bigger area to protect. 

A machine like this is designed to go with the motorized (APC, Stryker etc.) fast attacking troops. And because of its rate of fire and MRSI capability, it really makes a good question about the Arty.

"TalesFromRetail","t5_2t2zt","The way the law is written here, it's not that you're supposed to detain a visibly intoxicated customer, it's that you're not supposed to allow a customer to become visibly intoxicated. If your customer is visibly impaired when ordering, your job is to deny the sale. As a bartender/server, it's your responsibility to keep track of how much (and how fast) you customers are consuming and keep them at a rate/level that prevents them from becoming impaired.

Edit: as for the legality of detaining an intoxicated customer, if they choose to call the police because you're detaining them, they would have to admit their intention to drive drunk. According to the servers license class I took, you're supposed to do whatever you can, short of tying the customer to a bar stool, to keep them from driving while intoxicated. If they absolutely insist on leaving and won't let you call them a cab, you can call the police to report them for driving drunk, but you're still going to be in trouble for over serving.","1377994888"

If you lose weight too rapidly through intense exercise or diet, your body can slow your metabolism and stimulate your appetite for high energy foods - resistance is futile unless you have the willpower of a zen master.

Once you arrive at the weight you're happy with, then intense training might be suitable if you want to gain fitness or muscle definition.

We had dated for a month, it was pretty casual and I was pretty closed to him. He came back to my hometown with me and I took him to a 'world is ending' party with all my old friends from high school. The party started to go pretty sour, a guy I used to be friends with kept trying to get me to strip, and told my bf he was suppressing my free spirit. Bf started drinking heavily.. And it just kept getting worse.  

I helped bf to the bathroom to throw up. And that guy kept banging on the door and telling me to come back to the party. He kept saying things like, 'don't let your new boytoy ruin all your fun!' And 'kid can't handle his alcohol, he's not good enough for you!' 

At the same time, my boyfriend, in between pukes told me he had fallen in love with me. He said that he had never imagined himself spending the rest of his life with someone until he met me. I realized right then that my old life was over. And I wanted nothing more in the world than to be sitting next to this boy being sick. 

I got a trash can and locked the two of us in one of the bedrooms at the house (plan had been to spend the night there from the beginning). We left in the morning before anyone else woke up. I'm still madly in love with him and will marry him when I get out of college.","1377994899"

&gt; Or is manual focus the way to go?

If your camera is trying to use the flash, it's probably going to have a hard time autofocusing without it. Manual focus can be difficult with that camera as well but it's worth a try.

&gt; Will I be able to get decent shots without a fancy flash?

Depends what you consider to be a decent shot. An external flash will be more powerful, helping you light things further away if used directly. It may also come with an infrared autofocus assist, which is much better than strobing the flash.

It can also give you a softer overhead light if you have ceilings to bounce from. But direct on-camera light from an external flash has the same flaws as from your pop-up flash.","1377994904"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","You're right, it does say that. Almost immediately after, though, it also says this:

""When, therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of God. This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions which you find in this book. Do not let any prejudice you may have against spiritual terms deter you from honestly asking yourself what they mean to you. At the start, this was all we needed to commence spiritual growth, to effect our first conscious relation with God as we understood Him. Afterward, we found ourselves accepting many things which then seemed entirely out of reach. That was growth, but if we wished to grow we had to begin somewhere. So we used our own conception, however limited it was.""

Thus, just like the phrase ""higher power,"" the word ""God"" becomes whatever you want it to be. Again, for me, that was the meeting itself. It was simple - I would go to a meeting when I had the urge to drink, but afterwards, that urge would be gone until the next day, when I would just go to a meeting! After a month I felt I had gotten what I needed out of it and stopped. 

As an aside, I had a fun experience with the courts and AA. In my state, the penalty for DUI is jailtime of up to 6 months. Since this would have the state's few prisons bursting at the seams, they have a program for first-offenders that involves going to a class once a week for 12 weeks. It costs about a grand and you can't miss any, but if you successfully complete it (which really just means showing up), they will not convict you. Part of the class is checking out one AA meeting. Having heard of the case law involving compulsory AA attendance, I mentioned that this didn't seem right, and was told that since this class was optional, I was more than welcome to not attend and see what my jail sentence would be after the state's attorney convicted me!

EDIT: I should make the important distinction that due to the drawn-out legal process, I decided to go to meetings and then stop long before I learned I would be asked to go to one as a part of that program. ","1377994907"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I know it's cliche, but. . . . jetpacks.

Or at least, some other personal device (doesn't have to be rocket or jet powered, depending on how advanced you will imagine this society) which can levitate and transport the attached (or integrated) person, at least up to highway car speeds, and up to several thousand feet altitude.

That concept may be over-used in sci-fi, but I haven't seen any serious and consistent explorations into the societal and infrastructural ramifications of that kind of true mobility.  I think most writers and movie producers tend to jump straight from cars and trains on the road; to flying cars and spaceships . . . .neglecting the likely efficiencies and added benefits of personal-sized flying transport.  Cars made sense on the ground, because you need wheels,which humans don't have.  To have wheels, you need an axle and a large heavy powertrain, and steering, and it's all heavy.  Because it's all heavy and moves fast, its dangerous to be exposed to the mistakes of other drivers of large heavy objects around you.  Now personal transport, of course doesn't give you the flexibility to carry heavy things (imagine going to the hardware store for home renovations).  So different means must be in place for this.  But I think that most people would prefer the benefits of personal transport over the occasional convenience of being able to carry large payloads.

It's not just about flying. . . it's about being able to easily and quickly get in and out of spaces otherwise inaccessible.  (it unfortunately completely ruins corn-mazes).   It would open more space to wilderness, nature to take back over, and solitude to be enjoyed.  It would concentrate populations into dense cities for living and working.  Think: Corben Dallas' apartment in The Fifth Element, only less dystopian.  Spaces become much smaller and extremely purpose-built, but distances between those spaces could, in many cases, spread out.

Not only does it open up almost all space previously used as roads, to things such as additional buildings, office/home space, and green-belts;  but your society would also likely have developed windows on upper floors with one-way windows (passers-by and peeping-Tom's can't see in).  Cities and heavily populated areas will likely develop codes, increasing demand for airspace above buildings, and so creating a limit or a uniformity to the height of buildings in an area; to allocate scarce airspace to the many layers of air traffic (which decentralized control systems would reside with each users or his/her jetpack; and would operate in accordance with standards, set by the insurance agencies. . . otherwise you would not be able to afford medical or liability insurance).  Rescue in almost any situation becomes much easier and quicker.  Do parents retain control over their children's jetpacks, by accessing its computer and restricting flight, or even auto-piloting the child back home from questionable locations or situations?

The costs and time involved in transporting people and things from here to there is, and has always been, one of the primary and limiting factors inherent to reality.  It cannot be understated the effects that an energy source like this would have on everything.

Above all when writing fiction:  the derivation of the technology doesn't have to be completely explained (i.e. how did we get from combustion engines to warp-drives) . . . but once the reader has accepted the premise of the given technology, you MUST be consistent in its effects, its uses, and how other technologies developed in relation to it.","1377994907"

I remember last episode recap thread, someone said they wouldn't be able to take it if Petra died. I'm sorry, friend. That surprised the fuck out of me.

The three squadmates killing the female titan was *so awesome* I had trouble containing myself. The entire time I was thinking how cool what I was watching is. I was excited, but mostly gripped with fear that something terrible was about to happen. I mean, they were doing so well! Their coordination! That was amazing! The female titan was *afraid*! But... are good things allowed to even happen on this show?

I got my sad answer quickly afterwards.

And that wasn't even the end of the excitement! The pure **rage** that Eren felt, that fight sequence, Mikasa's own rage afterwards, and at the end Levi + Mikasa! Oh my god, things just keep getting better.

I really, REALLY hope that female titan doesn't survive/escape this whole ordeal.

Also:

1) Clearly, Eren's new top priority should be close combat training. He's got the rage and the strength. Just give him the technical skill and no one will stand a chance, especially once he starts developing his own unique powers (like hardening skin of the Female Titan).

2) I wonder who will be part of hte new Squad Levi?","1377994908"
"progmetal","t5_2s3pe","This may not be the most obvious answer (and you have some excellent theories, all of which I'm sure play a part) but I believe the following gives the most insight into your question. 

/r/progmetal actually existed for a good while as one of the smallest metal subreddits. Our mods did a *ton* of networking and putting our name out there. It was a pretty large struggle before we reached the point that subscribers just started to amass on their own. The problem with subreddit startups in general is that the creators/mods don't do too much to establish their name. This involves plugging the name wherever possible (and relevant) and x-posting to larger subs, etc. I did stupid amounts of this daily and I'm sure some of the other mods did also. 

So I think this is what sets us apart subscribers wise. I really don't think prog metal is by any means the most popular metal subgenre (though with the recent djent and ""progcore"" stuff somehow falling under the label, this is changing). It doesn't make sense that we'd have more subscribers than /r/deathmetal or /r/thrashmetal, or /r/PowerMetal, but again. Our early networking probably surpassed that of any of those subreddits.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Just at the beginning of this summer, actually...

I failed most of my classes this semester at Uni. I fell into a depressed state, fucked up, and really thought I could fix it all by myself without letting anyone know. Because, gosh darnit, I'm 23 and I should be *over* my depression by now- right? Right?

Well, it didn't work out like that. I failed 4 out of 5 classes, and got a D in the last one. Then I lied to my parents about not getting my grades in yet, and I stalled for a while. (The other semesters that I had mental issues ((depression *and* OCD, yay!)) I usually withdrew before anything affected my gpa horribly.)

(Even that semester, I went to talk to disability services, and then didn't go to the follow-up because I could *totally* handle it. Haha, no.)

One early summer morning, just as I'm over hating myself for messing up so badly, my grandmother asks about my grades. I tell her I just checked, and they're good! A's, B's, one C though. My mom looks at me like something is up, and asks me to open up the webpage so she can see.

... Fuck.

I try and stall, but she's having none of it. I cave, show her. Computer's taken away, credit cards, etc. I work in the garden with Mom for a few weeks as I'm not allowed to do nothing. Slowly given back technology.

New semester just started. I'm to be open about my health- if I'm mentally out of it, I'm to speak up. Went to see my shrink as well, setting up appointments for once in a while. So far I've gotten an A on a presentation, but can already feel the 'I'm going to fuck up' fear. 

I should be an adult, but ever since I was 18 I've been dealing with mental shit that makes me feel like I'm 5. Curl up in bed and cry, first reaction to bad things- 'if I off myself, I wouldn't have to deal with this' etc. I guess I'm still sort of fucked if I haven't shaken it yet.","1377994908"

Of course, don't just start in on them, participate in their blog before you start plugging your own project. There are a few sites to check out that are great for Independent film.

Player stats are also horribly balanced. All players start out as superman and end up as god by level 10. Perks are also terribly balanced and it's easy to see that Bethesda ran out of ideas as quite a few perks amount to +15 X skill so your character can max out every skill even earlier.

It was raining so I didn't want to stop and make everyone stand around in the rain, so I tried to hold it until we got to the campsite.  It reached a point where it was just unbearable.  We were in the bottom of a steep valley with lots of evergreens on the slopes.  I grabbed some toilet paper and a trowel and scampered up.  I was barely containing myself when I finally found a suitable location.  I didn't even bother to dig a hole.  I dropped my pants, and was about to begin when I heard a deep groan and crackle.  I looked around but saw nothing, yet it got louder.  It's cliché, but time slowed.  It took what felt like 10 seconds, but was really less than a second, to identify the groan as a falling tree.  I kept scanning the slope, squatting down with my pants around my ankles but I still saw no tree.  At this moment I just knew that tree was coming down on me.  It was too loud to be going anywhere else.  Even if I could see it, my pants kept me from moving away on the steep slope.  I was going to be killed in the absolute last way I wanted to go and it was unavoidable.  Everyone who knew me would hear I was crushed by a tree while taking a dump.  I heard it crash, but never saw where it landed.  Proudest thing about surviving that though, was that I didn't shit myself.","1377994933"

I would recommend getting a Microsoft brand controller rather than a 3rd party one.  They have always felt better to me.  As far as games I would recommend checking out Skyrim if you have not played it.  You can also get mods off the steam workshop to add more wildlife, I'm sure.  It's not that cheap as far as sales go, though.  The Witcher/The Witcher 2 are on sale all the time for something like 5 dollars and they both have controller support.","1377994936"

EUIV, with Lucky Nations, the one-way trade network and some events and missions acting weird, is unpolished and can sometimes bring you right out of the game.

When you can't route trade in a way you really should (play Japan and colonise the Phillipines, you'll see what I mean), or an event tells you you're bankrupt while you're pissing money away on buildings.

We had this female who was a hold over from the cycle before. She decided she was fed up with the Army and wanted out...so how the fuck did she do it? While another female was in the showers she took her rifle and HID THE FUCKING THING IN THE CLEANING SUPPLIES CLOSET. Shit got real pretty fast and before I knew it we were standing outside at attention for 4+ hours while they ripped apart the bays. 



After 48 hours they found it after another hold over seemed to magically know where it was. The Army didn't even press charges, they just chaptered her ass out. CID was involved and everything.

EDIT: I think the main problem I have is that it seems like you believe that Democrats just can't wait to go over and invade Syria.  This is really not the case.  If you have to make the claim that there are no anti-war protests, this isn't an accurate claim, because there are.  If you're claiming that they're irrelevant because they're not as big as the anti-Iraq War protests, then I'd say the main difference is that we haven't even figured out what the scale of our operation is going to be.","1377994950"

Smoking some celebratory maryjane with some buddies and were driving around when suddenly a wild cop appears! The moment those blue flashers came on I couldn't stop freaking out and my heart started racing. He proceeds to pull us over and begins asking questions. He pretty quickly figures out we had been smoking and he asks for our licenses (to clarify we're all in college). He then asks if we have any more weed (which we do, stuffed in a hollowed out arizona can in the passenger seat). One of my idiot friends tells him no we just smoked a joint and we have no more. Clearly suspicious, he asks the driver if he can inspect the car. Before we could tell him to refuse, my friend agreed. He sends us to his car and tells us to put our hands on the hood and wait till he's done. He starts with the drivers side, using his flashlight and scanning every inch of the seat. Then the back. Finally, the moment I though my life was over/Well I'm fucked: the passenger seat where the arizona can was simply lying on the floor. He opens the door searches the glove compartment and such and eventually finds the can. He picks it up and sort of weighs it in his hand but doesn't shake it. At this point, I have never been so terrified about all the implications of this crime on my record and getting my university involved. But somehow, he puts it down, closes the door and to make a long story short(er), he lets us go out of the kindness of his heart.

This isn't a proper logical fallacy that I know of so much as guided assumption making and it is the consequence of a misused metaphor. When used properly, a metaphor likens facets of something the audience doesn't understand to something the audience does understand (for instance hunger is often used for chemical reactivity). In this way the audience's logical understanding of one subject informs their logical understanding of another.

However, in the hands of people more concerned with winning arguments than finding truth metaphors can be a dangerous weapon, because it isn't simply logical understanding that we can transplant from one subject to another, but also emotional responses. We see evidence of this every day most commonly in Hitler analogies. We can liken for instance, one brown haired person to Hitler because they share that trait and in so doing we imbue the innocent party with all of the emotions we have toward Hitler even though those emotions have nothing to do with his hair colour.","1377994951"

I was the rebound guy and as such didn't last as BF. but I had befriended her and her family for some time and was trying to remain close though it was crushing me. I had been talking to her mother about all the drama and she was very sympathetic. I swung by one evening and my ex was getting ready for a night out with her new Bo who happened to be her ex Bo prior to me. I tried to play it cool. Her mom could tell I was upset and offered me some wine. Ex leaves, I stay chatting up her mom on the couch. She's late 40 early 50. It's funny how the tell tale signs when a girl/woman wants you, are relatively the same at any age except for one thing. If you don't make the obvious move on an older woman, she will. She did. It was awkward. For me at least. Don't get me wrong, it was hot, but I was used to younger girls and she wasn't exactly young. Very attractive and aggressive but I don't think my youth could keep up with her needs. I gave it my all and that was that. I don't think ex ever found out to my knowledge. I'd been back a couple times since and always wondered if that look in her moms eye was a ""yeah we fucked"" or if it was ""I bet you're much better now"".

Someone decided to use them - that (almost certainly) really happened.  It should be possible to determine who that was.  If it was Assad and/or the Syrian army, then there probably is information that the US, UK and others have from monitoring their communications and using satellites and other means of observation have about what they were doing and who gave what orders.

As panicked as I was, I still remembered that I had a life-jacket on, and that all I had to do was remain as physically calm as I could and I would float to the top. The ""well I'm fucked"" moment came when instead of that happening, my head came up straight into the bottom of the raft. There was no air, and I couldn't lift it off of me. Thankfully, the raft seemed to lift on its own, and my best friend (who used to be a lifeguard) threw it aside like Khan Noonian Singh threw that piece of the Reliant bridge which crushed Joachim.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I completely agree with this article. My first experience programming was on a TI-84. High school math never presented much of a challenge for me, so I had ample free time in class for ""subversive"" learning--developing programs to do the math for me, and on to writing simple games to play with my neighbors once I had all the math programs I needed. TI BASIC sure isn't the friendliest thing out there, but it was fully documented in the paper manual, which went a long way towards helping me understand it. If I wanted to do something or understand what something did, all I had to do was flip through it. 

It was what piqued my interest in programming (I had thought up to that point that I wanted to major in physics in college), and certainly went a long way towards making my introductory courses in college much less jarring than they were for many of my peers. While I didn't have any foundation in the languages we worked with, my experience in TI BASIC helped me learn the mindset and workflow that goes into developing a program, and gave me a greater appreciation for the features of languages that I was learning. I could use functions instead of jumping around my program with gotos, labels, and menus! I could have identifiable local variables instead of a bunch of single-letter global ones! It gave me an appreciation for the things most people at my age take for granted in a programming language.

Beyond the programming, too, spending time writing programs for a calculus or a physics class went a long way towards my understanding of the material at hand. For example, I put together a program to do basic vector math and display. It could add and subtract vectors, convert between rectangular and polar coordinates, and display them on a graph, even showing the addition/subtraction graphically. By the time I was done, I was intimately familiar with all the odd cases that could arise working with vectors and the different coordinate representations of them. That kind of experience with the material beyond assigned homework made a huge difference for me, and I'm sure it has for others who have done similar things.","1377994966"
"technology","t5_2qh16","Generally speaking the packetised connections are made over the most economical use of bandwidth, which leads to more hops and latency.

This change (as noted by the testimony) does not necessarily translate into a poorer experience, and in many/most scenarios would be a better experience. The original purpose of the relay system was to provide a fall back when the facetime users had too much latency between their end points.

Forcing the use of a high speed commercial relay which has direct world-wide branches (aka akamai) would in most cases decrease the number of hops and improve the service experience. The downside is that this is more costly to implement.

The scenario where quality could decrease are situations where there was already a highly efficient or significantly shorter route between the two parties (e.g. same ISP), in those cases a hop onto a relay would introduce a small, but insignificant, path.

As it stands to reason that facetime users are geographically distant, the current system most likely is a forced-improvement.

I'm an atheistic Buddhist so AA's principles were in conflict with the Buddhist principle that the power to change comes from within yourself and, of course the fact that I hold no belief in Gods.

There are several organizations that you can recommend. I used Rational Recovery but there is also S.O.S., Secular Organization for Sobriety and Women for Sobriety.  

WFS is particularly helpful because the challenges female alcoholics face are usually different then mens and some AA/NA groups can be predatory toward women that are in a vulnerable state i.e., the 13th step.  

Again thanks for having the insight to realize AA is not a one fits all fix.
Best wishes to you!

It hurts a bit yeah, but eventually you learn to live with and harness it as a power to move to the next person.

Also here's another thing you should keep in mind. The girl you're approaching is your biggest fan (for a while). She wants you to succeed. She wants you to impress her with your personality and sweep her off her feet. So when you come in stuttering and scared you are failing to meet her expectations. Just go in calmly and sweep her off her feet, or move on. There's nothing to be afraid of.

Pictured is a stock TM M14. Internals soon to be replaced with a Fusion Engine. Why? Simplicity, sound, trigger response, to name a few. Also, customizability, and a very easy system for me to tinker with and modify compared to a gearbox, among other reasons.

Ingredients:

* TM M14 SOCOM
* Guarder KAC Rail
* Flyye Stock Cheek Rest Pouch Thing
* King Arms M3 3.5-10x Scope
* Some Scope Extender off ShooterCBGear
* Killflash off ShooterCBGear
* AIM Sports 30mm Rings
* Firefield 7-9in Bipod
* Angel Vortex Flashhider
* G&amp;P M14 Supressor
* MAG Short M14 Mags
* 2 Socks, Black (Temporary Cheek Riser. ""If its stupid, and it works..."")

To Do:

* Paintjob (I'm thinking tan base, wide brown stripes, toss some ideas out, I'm open to stuff thats not too complex)

* Send it to Bingo for a P* install.

* Some kind of aftermarket barrel, toss some suggestions out if you have them.


As always, questions or anything, feel free to ask.


I'll be posting more projects within the coming weeks, so stay tuned.

I think Fremantle supporters ought to give Geelong Football Club a little more respect please, they've gone from nearly folding in 1999 (or even relocating all their home games to Melbourne), swimming in debt, losing 5/5 grand finals they've played in to continually delivering a profit every year the past 9 years, played 9 from the last 10 finals series, playing in 4 Grand Finals, winning 3 of them, bringing in a plethora of revenue for the AFL, I think after all the hard work Geelong has done since 1999 they finally deserve a final at their home.","1377994983"

Some Americans have gone through two extensive changes away from whatever colonial accent(s) existed: the [father-bother merger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%E2%80%93bother_merger#Father.E2.80.93bother_merger) and [the cot-caught merger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%E2%80%93bother_merger#Cot.E2.80.93caught_merger) so where some British speaker pronounce three different vowels in &lt;caught&gt;, &lt;cart&gt;, and &lt;cot&gt;, some Americans have the same vowel for all three words (disregarding rhoticity).","1377994985"

Secondly, and more importantly, I think the card is iiiinteresting. I think it's a bit overpowered in a bunch of cases, but it is very situation dependent. The major issue is that it's mostly going to be used on your opponent's turn. SO, it restarts that player's turn. That's okay, maybe. It also exiles all spells on the stack, and counters uncounterables, which would be a little bit annoying. 

It also opens up a lot of ability for interesting plays. Let's say your opponent sphinxes up to 15 cards in hand and you upkeep this. That's a 3 mana discard 8. Situationally dependent, but strong. It breaks off post-combat kill spells. It shuts off a lot of your opponent's ability make plays, and thereby is kiind of an unfun card.

That said, at worst, it's a counterspell that let's them untap, costed the same as cancel, with a good amount of ability for interesting play.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","A little background. Walked away from any/all religion at 14, been in alcohol/drug free for over 25 years. I would just like to add that when AA was founded there weren't many options available to treat alcoholism. AA was partially based on the Oxford group, a quasi religious organization.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Alcoholics_Anonymous
I think it important to understand that above all AA is a support group and anyone who has suffered the ravages of addiction understands what a lonely existence it is. We are social creatures by necessity just look at the way most primates interact. Alcoholism/addiction does not lend itself to being ""one among many"". So part of the appeal is being with like minded people who understand what you've been through and how you felt. To this day I can say the same thing to former alcoholics and ""normal"" people and I'm always amazed at the differences in the way they see it and what is offered. You can find people in AA who are of the "" all the answers are in the big book"". When I hear that I think of the many religious who say the same thing about the bible.  So for me I had to learn to ""take what I like and leave the rest."" I like a great deal about what AA has taught me, to be responsible for my life, deal with past actions, how to have men in my life, to be a productive useful member of society. Just don't get caught up with the dogma. Is it religious, is it spiritual, does the supreme court decision mean anything, does it matter? If you care to find another way, and there now are other ways and methods that did not exist back then, by all means look into them and see if they offer enough for you to recommend them. One of the things AA has are meetings everywhere all the time and the cost of admission is a desire to stop drinking. I sponsor men and don't share much about what my ""beliefs"" unless they ask. I gently guide them to find out what is real for them. If you have a message to share with other men do it because the 12 steps are about love and service. If you want to help, don't make this about you. ","1377994988"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was planning to have sex for the first time recently and my best friend kept insisting that it was going to hurt and I should expect bleeding. She was young and uninformed her first time, with a guy who didn't care about her unfortunately. I'm 21, I was prepared and my partner and I were in love. It didn't hurt at all. I think it's really sad how little some girls know about their own sexual health, they've been convinced that your first time has to involve pain and even bleeding. 

EDIT: I don't think sex magically doesn't hurt just because your partner cares about you, that's just a bonus. It's taking the time to prepare that actually makes the experience less painful. The fact that multiple women are insisting that it was normal that they bled just sort of proves my point. Sure, many women bleed, but that doesn't mean it's unavoidable.

EDIT 2: I know the bleeding is caused by breaking the hymen. I know that is it easier for some girls than others depending on various past experiences that affect the hymen. I also know that you don't have to *break* your hymen. That's the myth. If you stretch it ahead of time it won't be torn upon penetration.

A more entertaining source, [Youtuber Laci Green (addresses pain around 1:51)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdYtYveJI1Y)

EDIT 3: I give up. It was never my intention to pass judgements or criticize someone else's sexual experiences. Unfortunately, this seems to be what others have taken away from everything I have said. If women continue to tell other women that pain is unavoidable (as my friend did with me) I feel like more girls will be inclined to give their partner permission to continue through the pain rather than stopping and slowly working the hymen to a point where the penis can be inserted without pain.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I would say tusk is mediocre. But he does have his strengths.

I don't think he's worth trilane farm, which means you'd probably do either a support tusk, or a solo mid tusk, or a throwaway offlane tusk.

I could maybe see a support tusk.
His ult basically stuns through magic immunity for 1 second. His sigil can be used for scouting as well (even if it is only level 1). Ice shards scales only with damage and cooldown, so theres no loss for a support to only have 1 level of this, it has 100% cc with just the one level.

Could work mid though, similar to dragon knight with less push/tank.

I think ultimately wherever you put him, he will most likely won't pack as much of a punch as other heroes in the lane would.

I would say he's considerably stronger than a bunch of the other nonpicked heroes. He has fairly reliable CC, He has counter push, his CC level 1 isn't terrible. He is melee though,  it's easy to exploit grouping up the snowball causes.

I think he could use with a buff to snowball, especially the stun duration, or perhaps an intelligence increase. I think he has a bunch of potential though. 

As far as pubs go though, he's not too shabby. Not much a fan of the old battlefury build though. ","1377994994"

""When I was sitting on a HFT trading desk and the guy next to me had a PhD in Bioinfomatics, the guy on the other side had a PhD in Climate Science *from Harvard*, the guy behind me designed semiconductors for Intel and another guy had a Masters in math from MIT and these guys are all working on a HFT desk. You could have had someone looking for a cure for cancer, someone helping address the issues of global warming, another one leading advances in semiconductor design and technology and yet here they are trying to find their fortune on wallstreet."" 

So tell me something... who's to blame? These individuals are gifted enough to have achieved academically what most cannot, do they not have to right to maximize their own utility? Why should someone work for $60k when they can command a salary of $400k? 

The Cold War 'ended' and with it much of the funding for research in physics, a large group of highly intelligent people suddenly found themselves without the means to make a living. They did not control the geopolitical landscape nor the state of scientific funding in America at that time, they simply dedicated their lives to a dead end, financial institutions provided a second option. 

I realize that I am referring to history (2-3 decades ago), but it is important to understand how we go to this point... your assertion that that these individuals are best utilized in other disciplines is subjective, biased by your own personal view and ignorant of realities conditions. 

While we might disagree on the net effects of HFT, we can both agree that the control of financial/economic systems is paramount to social stability. It could be argue that the largest immediate crisis facing humanity is the economic welfare of Europe. 

You might retort with flash crashes, that HFT is detrimental to financial stability, but do you honestly believe that there are no HFT desks dedicated to identifying false crashes in order to profit off of the opportunities they provide? Flash crashes are just a growing pain, quote stuffing will simply drive improvements in exchange design. Every problem is a solution waiting to be born, you have no foundation for asserting that other individuals can better spend their time outside of HFT.

My parents both worked full time, so when I was in junior high I was home alone pretty often. We had gotten a computer, but it was still a new thing, so my parents didn't really, *completely,* understand how it worked. Or so I thought...

I was good about deleting the Internet history when I would look up dirty gay things...until one day they called me downstairs. My parents were at the computer. Dad sitting, mom standing. And they said calmly, ""We'd like to know what this is about..."" I hadn't deleted the history as thoroughly as I had thought. 

They were very supportive and understanding (more upset about me using the computer when I wasn't supposed to). But I remember being terrified, ashamed, and feeling like I was going to shit out my heart. Definitely one of the first ""Oh fuck"" moments for me. ","1377994995"

I honestly think medical treatment and coverage of it shouldn't be based on a system that pays or doesn't pay out based on culpability criteria.

Now, I DO think that incentivizing healthier lifestyles and behaviors IS a good system, though. As in --- offer discounts to the people who exercise at least 30 min a day 5x per week, to bipolars who take their mood stabilizers, the alchoholics who are actively in treatment, the obese who are trying to lose weight or who are improving their diets, etc.","1377994995"

So you have to hover over them (and the expanded element) in order to read them, that's fine, but when they expand below my view I have to scroll down, and if my mouse accidentally end up below the expanded element, it collapses and I have to locate it again, which becomes confusing quick. My CSS is a bit rusty, but if they could be made to expand/collapse on click instead, that would definitely be preferable.

Oh, and one more thing. The header image in the sidebar is completely unnecessary and only serves to make me scroll more to get to the actual content of the sidebar.

"Hawaii","t5_2qi3u","Others have said it... but it bears repeating. **VISIT FIRST... MANY TIMES**

If you can't afford to come here as a tourist, you can't afford to live here.

First, each island is vastly different from the others.

Second, the majority of people who move here leave within 5 years due to one or more of the following:

* Extreme distance and cost from friends/family elsewhere
* Island fever
* Cost
* Lack of good paying jobs (sure, you work from home now... so did I)
* Can't handle the locals
* Can't handle the environment

This is the most isolated place on the planet, 2500 miles from mainland in all directions.  Everything costs more.

That said, your best dollar would be on the East side of the Big Island. House prices are reasonable... Hilo is a nice small city with a local island feeling.  The Big Island is big enough that you will avoid Island fever.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","The best thing to do in my opinion is use some premade adventures (I mainly use ones set in the Forgotten Realms) but use them in your own over-arching storyline. The challenge is to figure out how to modify the small story pieces of those pre-made adventures to make them make sense in the context of your larger over story arc. For example, my wife plays a druid and the over arcing story right now is she is trying to find out who her parents are. well her father was a ranger who hunted lycanthropes but then he became one. Now he is a member of the People of the Black Blood, so i'm using the premade in the back of the FR Silver Marches book as the ""climax"" to this story arc but i will embellish it a bit with an epic battle between druids, treants and the lycans.

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","Favorite One Piece character?  That sir is pretty much an impossibility!  One Piece is filled to the brim with so many likeable characters, all for equally valid and different reasons I will however give take some time to rave about one of the characters closest to my heart.

**Bentham, Mr. 2, Bon Kurei**

To be honest, my first meeting with the character wasn't the best.  During my first attempt at reading One Piece I worked my way up to the Alabasta arc remember clearly hating the silly characters of baroque works with a passion, Bentham being the worst of the lot.  I kick myself now for not sticking with the series (sue me, I was a stupid high-schooler).  Only after a 2nd attempt at the series did I notice the brilliance of the OP universe and did I fall in love with Bentham.

Near the end of the Alabasta arc is when I noticed how Bentham stood apart from other OP characters.  When the marines were descending upon the Strawhat crew Bentham took it upon himself to personally save the crew he was fighting not a few chapters ago, all in the name of friendship and brotherly love.  Here, the story arc enters a lull, being picked up again in again during the Impel Down arc.  During Luffy's infiltration the two meet back up.  There they rekindle their thicker-than blood friendship and Bentham again shows his devotion to Luffy by carrying the crippled captain on his back to the Newkama Kingdom and doing everything in his power to save his friend.  After the two of them had sufficiently healed, the two fought side-by-side to defy all odds and escape the inescapable prison.  At the end of this ordeal is when the crap hit the fan a second time with Bentham sacrificing himself YET AGAIN, all in the name of friendship.  To sacrifice your very life not once, but TWICE for a single person... that is more than kindness and love for your fellow man, that is an inhuman level of commitment to belief in your friends that more than rivals any manga character I've read since.

You have NO idea how much bliss I was in when Oda decided to bring him back during the ""From the Decks of the World"" cover story.

Thank you for being such a generous guy and giving us all a chance during this giveaway!  Have an awesome day and thank you for giving me a chance to display my Bentham love.","1377995021"

I play both LoL and Dota (and I'm pretty awful at both, but whatevs) and I'd ask that you all simmer down a bit before you bust out the pitchforks. Firstly, I'm at PAX now, and I was at PAX East, and I have fairly solid connections with a number of show organizers. The onus here is on Valve, not Riot. There are about a hojillion other MOBAs here (everyone and their grandma is developing a MOBA these days), and PAX doesn't exactly take kindly to company bullying, so no, Riot doesn't have PA in their pocket. If anything, Mike and Jerry are closer to Gaben and the rest of Valve in terms of friendly relations.

Valve has no presence here, and didn't really have any presence at PAX East. You are not allowed to install software on the shared computers, and whoever said the 'play LoL instead' comment doesn't represent PAX's opinion on the matter.

I was going about 70 on the highway, and I'm passing this flatbed semi as I go around a corner. All of a sudden, it started to pour down some rain. I slow down, but the semi doesn't. All of a sudden, the flatbed starts sliding into my lane. I move over, drop off the edge of the road, and when I attempt to come back onto the road, I feel a bump and start sliding sideways. Of course, the only thing I could imagine was sliding under that semi at 60ish mph and getting cut in half. Fortunately, I just took out some road signs and broke the back window in my car.

A side note: Insurance was a huge hassle, and basically told me that if I had let the truck hit me, everything would've been much easier.","1377995037"

Then he blew into the body from his own spirit, and thus Adam came to life. Eve was created in a similar fashion but her material came from Adam's rib. This is not exactly a literal description of the creation of Adam and Eve, of course, but it is precise enough that we cannot say that Adam and Eve never existed as two individuals, or that Adam and Eve were descended from non-humans.

There is no gene for the soul - the soul isn't physical. Animals have souls too, just not the same as humans.

There has been tons of human evolution since Adam and Eve. There have been different subspecies of humans, Neanderthals being the best known example, but recently we've found out about the Denisovans too. A couple examples of relatively recent human evolution that I know of are lactose tolerance into adulthood and the lesser prevalence of wisdom teeth as compared to the past.","1377995041"

Sit her down and talk with her, make sure that she knows that you love her and just want to support her, but it's getting harder and harder with time and the constant non-communication. Then offer to take her to the doctor or the school's counselling center, so that the process to get better can be started. Don't force her to tell you what is wrong, let her know that no matter what, she will always be amazing and beautiful to you. But it's hurting you to see her hurting and you want to do everything possible to make it so that she never has a reason to not smile again. 

If she can't get herself to see a therapist, maybe introduce her to some subreddits here. /r/TwoXChromosomes, /r/depression and /r/offmychest might be places that can help her. If she doesn't want to do it so ""publicly"", tell her that she is free to PM me. I have been diagnosed with Clinical Depression and have worked through a lot of years, where I'd rather have just been anybody but me. 

Start the process with her, but remember to respect her wishes as well. Even if all she wants is to be left alone. She is lucky to have you in her corner. ","1377995043"

"SQL","t5_2qp8q","Seriously, drop SQLite. You will most likely outgrow it quickly. MySQL innodb engine is way more stable than SQLite.

You would be better off with the ""complexity"" of MySQL users. You just create a user for your application and grant the proper permissions to that user.

CREATE USER 'webapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON webappdatabasename.* TO 'webapp'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Then you just make sure your website uses that user. Wham, bam, done with setting up users for your webapp.

EDIT: Reading more on SQLite, if your users often add new bands to their favorites you're going to have issues. It looks like SQLite performs a full database lock on writes, so they will have to be performed sequentially. This means no two users can write to the db at the same time.

I call him ""THIS BUSINESS Junior"" because that's the role he's taken on.  He's taken bits and pieces from a lot of wrestling I dislike and molded them all into one tidy little package that everyone sees as so original.  He's always overcoming the odds like Hulk Hogan, he rants and raves like Rowdy Roddy Piper, he stole the Macho Man's elbow for christ's sake, stole the GTS and really only has about five other moves at his disposal.  
  
The thing that gets me the most though is his constant subtle whining. I don't think that's CM Punk doing it either, I think it's Phil Brooks.  If you listen to what he says, he's always fucking complaining about something.  He still puts on good matches with his WWE counterparts but he has undeniable become complacent in WWE and lost a step or two.  There's no way he could work an ROH or PWG or Dragon Gate show. He'd look like a lost puppy.  
  
Instead, he's a made man, he knows he's a made man so he can rest on his laurels yet still fucking complains about it.  
  
He's gone from being a wrestler to being a WWE Superstar which I don't think he ever intended on becoming. Bluntly stated, he's lost his edge that made him as captivating and as special as he once was.  Now he's just another guy on the roster, stuck in a silly, seemingly endless angle.

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","&gt; Did they remove anything important? Is there something I could worry about?

No one can answer these question with certainty except the developers because this game is unreleased. So here's the best recommendation I can make for you. Did you like Shogun 2? Did you play Rome? Then you should get Rome 2!

And this is the problem with recommending unreleased games. Maybe Rome 2 is just as you described, and it's fantastic. Or maybe it comes out and it's a fucking mess. I like Creative Assembly but Empire was a mess when it came out. Who's to say that Rome 2 won't also come out largely broken? No one really knows until it comes out, so all we've got to go on is press and rumors. I don't think those are a good basis for making quality recommendations. I don't even like recommending games I haven't personally played. 

Are games like Arma 3, Minecraft, and Rising Storm considered unreleased? I'd say no. They're more or less released, they're just not finished. Anyone can buy Arma 3 and start playing immediately. If you recommend Arma 3 to someone, it's not a guess based on press and rumors. You've played it. You can tell someone why you like it or specific problems you have with the game. Even if you haven't played it, you could search around Arma 3 discussions and see how it's being received. 

I haven't been around this subreddit for long, but I imagine rule 2 is about quality recommendations. Anyone can make a recommendation based on previews and screenshots, but as we've seen plenty of times in the past, the game was see in previews might not be the game we get on release. ","1377995049"

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","Well, nearly each and every plant on that list needs very acid soil, somewhere around 5.5 to 6.0, so the very first thing you need to do is purchase a good soil test kit and start checking pH, as well as Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K) and Phosphorus (P).

I loaned my kit to a neighbor who's tomatoes kept dying, and she had *zero* Nitrogen in her garden.  The poor things were starving!  A good application of compost and a bit of liquid fish emulsion, and she was soon on her way to tomato glory.

If you want to go the professional/full-contact route, contact your local Cooperative Extension office and request a soil kit.  It will come with detailed instructions on how to take a sample, then mail it off.  In a few weeks, you'll get a *very* detailed report on just what's in your soil, as well as plenty of recommendations on how to alter the chemistry in whatever direction you want to take it.

**Edit:**  [Here is an example for my state, North Carolina.](http://www.ncagr.gov/agronomi/sthome.htm)

I live in the middle of a pine and oak forest, but my garden is around 7.9 pH.  I had to add a two whole bags of aluminum sulfate just to get it down around 6.5, and I'll be doing some tests again this fall to see if I need to add elemental sulfur.  Elemental sulfur is a ""slow"" acidifier, as it takes a few months for the microbes to gobble it up and spit it out in acidic form.  It's a great way to condition your garden right after the last harvest in late fall.

Adding AlSO4 was a *very* drastic action on my part, as I wanted to prep my garden for the spring planting.  It got quick results, but going for the quick fix can do a *lot* of damage if you're not exceptionally careful.  The good news is that adding too much ""quick"" acid can be fixed, as acid will leach out over time, and there are plenty of plants that love acid.

Adding too much ""quick base"", such as slaked lime, *cannot* be fixed. At least not easily, or cheaply.

So do your math *very* carefully, and always take the long-term route for altering soil pH.  Use wood ashes to increase pH, and peat or sulfur to decrease it.","1377995055"

(As well as those ""testimonials"" in commercials where people say stuff like, *""...and two months later I got a check in the mail for $3000, from out of nowhere!""*)

There's also that book, [The Prayer of Jabez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prayer_of_Jabez), that's sold around 10 million copies... The author basically interprets a piece of scripture to make the claim that a ""contract"" exists between God and man, in which God is *obligated* to provide wealth and prosperity to anyone who specifically prays for it (or something).

I don't care that you don't like. That A) isn't how the rules of this sub work. and B) you shouldn't make claims you don't have sources for, and if you have sources don't get bent out of shape is someone asks for them. That is pretty simple edicate that no one should have to explain to you.

except for the link I attached on my original comment that you felt the need to downvote because for some reason attaching a source shows some weakness that requires you to be rude and disregard the rules of this sub.

First make a list of what you do have. And write 3 things about each item on that list regarding its kickassness. Cool, you should be freaking out less and feeling pretty good about yourself.

Now, look at what you don't have. An MCAT score and ECs. The MCAT is a no-brainer (hah if only), study hard, take the test. Did poorly? Study again and take it again.

ECs? Like johnnyscans said, take a look at what you like.  Hobbies? Interests? Use the time you have now to develop yourself, you won't have too much time to do it later in med school. Pre-Med Fraternity? Sounds like an EC to me, start getting more involved, join the e-board, plan events, you will find yourself more involved if you're doing things you like.

And even better if google does an upgrade to their server (in this case changing how the API, which by the way wasn't open in the first place, works) why should Niantic have to make sure that IITC is supported and still works, for example when WoW does a patch that changes the way add ons work they don't go around and test every addon to make sure it still works with the new system, they just upgrade and let the developers figure it out.

Over time you're gonna meet awesome new people and form some friendships that will last a lifetime.  An hour away from home is enough to break away from any old restrictions you've had.  You are an adult, a new person of responsibility.

Don't feel intimidated by college.  Often times it's a lot more relaxed and easier than high school in some ways.  Keep in mind that there is no social difference in your year.

Just write down your dreams when you remember them, and if you dont, write in that you don't recall a dream. And keep focusing on dreaming like you are. If, after a while, that doesnt work, try adjusting your sleep cycle using alarms and such (while still maintaining the journal). You have around 5 dreams every night, varying based on how much you sleep. Waking up in the middle of one helps memory a lot, which is why adjusting your sleep cycle can help.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Wait, you mean like full on digitigrade gait? I don't think that should really be any *better* for the foot than the normal plantigrade gait. The motion of rolling your foot from heel to toe with each step is highly efficient at handling the weight of the body as it moves over the foot. Walking on the toes also places more pressure on the foot structure since the body's weight is being placed on a smaller area than it would if the whole foot is used. On top of that, digitgrade gaits are less efficient for humans because it requires constant muscle tension to maintain your balance on that smaller surface area. The stress on the calves to maintain your posture may result in the calves you have, but there's also strain on tendons of the foot, which can negatively impact the efficiency of arch in bearing weight.

But, perhaps, you mean that you switched from heel-strike to toe-strike walking, which is still a plantigrade gait, though less common. I may have misunderstood what you originally said.","1377995082"

What Bioware is doing here, and what CD Projekt is doing with Witcher 3 and probably Cyberpunk 2077, is marrying the old school style of RPGs that generally had good stories with the open world RPGs, predominantly made popular by Bethesda. Open world is all the rage now and I can't blame EA/Bioware for going in this direction because it's popular, because it has a wider appeal. Yeah, you're not getting another DA:O from Bioware but who cares when you have inExile making those types of games, which they're infinitely more capable of pulling off successfully.","1377995090"

Pretty amazing, actually, you can't even see the car. Well, one time my girlfriend (usually overly cautious) is driving, a few months after learning to drive stick. She's going a bit fast, and then I see the cement low water crossing, around a turn, over a dry, rocky creek bed. I yell for her to slow down, but she chokes, and the tires start to slip on loose rock on the turn. We're headed right over the edge of this bridge about 6 feet above sharp rocks at 40 miles an hour...and I'm sure it's over.

I think the plot of each book is more than the fights.  Well I haven't read the Hunger Games, only seen the movie.  But I hear it's quite true.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I've run my plan through FIREcalc and it has a high probability of success.  If everyone goes as planned, I'll be done at 40 (started seriously saving at 31).  There are some unknowns such as market performance, my wife's future income, the true impact of kids, the prospect of future raises and potential post retirement consulting and work.  However most of the unknowns are probable to increase my success rather than reduce it.

When my plan hits a 95% success rate, I'm done.  I'm not so scared of a shortfall because retiring at 40 gives you opportunities to make up the shortfall that an older retiree doesn't have.  I'm the sort of person that's also comfortable with a bit of a riskier plan, I can adapt and change to deal with future problems.

I feel like I'm having a ton of fun in the present, even though we are being careful with money.  It's all about cutting relentlessly on the things that don't bring you happiness and reserving time and money for the things that do.

And yet I consider all three of those films to be phenomenal (although yes, Empire is definitely far better than the other two). I would not say that writing is their strong suit, per say, but it does not bury the films. (The screenplay itself is weaker than the overall story though).

I strongly disagree with your assessment of the dialog during the final duel. Not much more to say about it, really - clearly different opinions.

However, in the prequel trilogy, every single aspect of the writing is way worse. Particularly how obviously illogical the characters' actions are. Especially in episodes 1 and 2. Oh, and Jar Jar.

Most of the reasons you listed BW as being superior weren't even done for that reason, it was because of programming limitations given the time that the game was developed.

I don't know about you but other than nostalgia factor there's no way in hell I could ever go back to playing a game like BW after being used to how much better RTS' are today in terms of game mechanics. BW made for a very high skill cap with all the limitations in gameplay but it's foolish to think that any game in the future should ever attempt to mimic that, we'd literally be taking a step back in game development by losing features that are pretty much standard in the industry nowadays.

Now as for units, that's a different story, I have no problem if you want to add in BW units to SC2 as long as it's done right and they're properly balanced. If you look back at BW win rates they were pretty imbalanced for months/years on end and we don't want a repeat of the last year of WOL.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Don't bother; assuming you're in the US, you have no case against the director (if you're not in the US, I have no idea, and please disregard everything I'm saying). Among other things, truth is an absolute defense to libel or defamation, and whether or not you think her message came across as inaccurate, it sounds like she didn't fabricate anything. Omission is not fabrication, and your assumption that your mother spoke sarcastically doesn't negate the accuracy of the quote, whether or not it was taken out of context, nor does it mean that the director necessarily interpreted it the same way. The director was exercising her rights under the first amendment.

I agree with the other posters that getting a lawyer involved would create a public relations nightmare (google the ""Streisand Effect). Moreover, depending on what state you're in, a lawsuit that's clearly meant to quell lawful speech -- and you haven't said anything to indicate this speech wasn't lawful -- can lead to significant costs for the plaintiff under anti-SLAPP statutes. Just wait for the whole thing to blow over.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Gay dude here. Here's my opinion on what's going on: When you straight boys start to notice the opposite sex around puberty, we gay boys start to notice other boys. You know how you're awkward and sorta star stuck with cute girls? That's how we are around other boys. That makes participating in sports and other typically ""straight guy"" stuff fraught with tension as we try to play it cool and fit in even though we're pretty crushed out on our male classmates. Middle school being the hellhole that it is for anyone who's different (or sensitive, or artsy, or weird), we're often called out for being gay (and some of us are just too gay ever successfully be closeted), so we take refuge in hanging out with girls, who like having non threatening male friends and appreciate our company. If you start to hang out more with girls than straight guys in your formative years, you adopt their speech patterns and body language and so on. Once you finally have the guts to come out, you wear your difference (that you used to be so ashamed of) as a badge of honor, and refuse to conform to straight notions of speech and body language.

Feminism, anti-racism, and other facets of social justice on the other hand rely on ethical tenants like ""racism is wrong"" which are not inconsistent with atheism, but also not directly related.

I believe the relationship between social justice and atheism only exists due to cultural context.  Because many traditional religions promote bigotry, the rejection of religion often results in individuals becoming increasingly tolerant.

I did a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1l5zbc/some_history_behind_4underarm_measurement/) earlier this week with some information on the history of +4.  Basically, you used to just order a bra by your bust measurement, like other garments (dresses, shirts, etc).  So, your bust would measure 36"", you'd order a 36 bra.  Then they added cup sizes which were basically estimates of projection, but still the number correlated to your *bust* size (36A was 36 bust with small ""boob"" amount 36B was medium boob-age, etc).  Some point in the 60/70s they switched it to underband measurement (the European regulating body actually passed a regulation saying it had to be this way), and women wanted to keep ordering their same sizes, so then the measuring system agapted to that.  Now it just makes no sense but no one (except for ABTF and a few shops) has bothered to correct it.","1377995122"

Simply put, small shaped nuclear charges would be detonated behind the craft, which would in essence ""ride the explosion"" via a massive pusher plate. The study was effectively ended when the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibited the use of nuclear weapons in space. While definitely an odd idea, the Orion Drive is one of the few engine designs that offers both high thrust and high fuel efficiency, with the additional bonus of artificial gravity on-board the spacecraft if the explosions are timed right.

For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.

Without getting into a cock measuring contest, I can say that any cut with ""slim"" in the name won't go over my thighs even if I size up an inch or two in the waist. I have tried, and it makes me feel like a whale. Every time a brand comes out with a ""normal"" cut, (i.e. a cut that will fit over my relatively normal legs) I hear a zillion guys complain that it's just way too loose! You're right, my measurements aren't really that far outside the norm, but they are pretty far outside the norm for raw denim apparently.
