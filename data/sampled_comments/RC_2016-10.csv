"chemistry","t5_2qhf9","A bit late to the party here but I'd say people like Robert West, Alan Cowley and Masaaki Yoshifuji could be deserving. These are some of the biggest names in main group chemistry and were the first chemists to break the ""double bond rule"" the view that heavy elements couldn't form multiple bonds. Apart from in transient unstable molecules.

West's group did the first Si=Si bond in 81

Yoshifuji's group did the first P=P bond also in 81

And Cowley's did As=As in 83.

You could argue that Cowley's was derivative of Yoshifuji's however it didn't behave as similar as you'd expect and as far as I know was the first true double bond between period 4 elements.

Interestingly the diphosphene made by yoshifuji isn't just a thermally stable P=P it is air stable as well.

These 3 basically spawned a whole field of low valent and low coordination number main group species. We now have double bonds of most main group elements and triple bonds of all carbon group elements. Ohh and a boron triple bond in an NHC stabalised diboryne.

Having said that I am doubtful any of these chemists would win as the main group isn't exactly fashionable currently.",1475280000

I cant speak for SF4 much but coming from a relative novice; combos and moves in Guilty Gear seem to be more responsive and make more sense with the inputs. So maybe there is something to the input lag issue.",1475280003

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Most drugs don't affect my posthumans.

The exception? A certain variety of plant found all over the world, in every human-inhabited environment, produce leafs/fruits/vegetables containing human neurotransmitters, which are then refined by posthumans and injected directly into the bloodstream in order to increase that neurotransmitter's production. The refined stuff can be used to permanently alter a successor's personality over time, which was used by several dictators to maintain control of their populations; its historical misuse means that most nations heavily regulate it, and only allow it for medical purposes after being approved by wizards who understand it well. Poorly refined versions of the drug can cause the opposite effect - for example, dopamine might cause someone to permanently fall into a deep depression. Overuse of even the refined versions will cause a death spiral, causing a successor to fall into [Anderson Syndrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/552sxa/what_are_the_some_interestingbizzareterrible/d87c9gn), which is the lethal depression-like disorder that kills most successors.

A technique created long ago lets people mix various different neurotransmitter-plants to create the planet's alcohol equivalent, with a variety of resulting experiences from mild inebriation to LSD/shroom trips, depending on the way it's made. Posthuman psychology means that mixes are less likely to cause Anderson Syndrome, and so this is much less regulated than the unmixed version. The more talented the maker of the mix is, the more the mix is an experience instead of a feeling.

Some people argue that the plants feel, and so hurting them is normally considered animal abuse.

The plant itself adapts to its environment, coming in a lot of different varieties, although the most cultivated ones are massive underground flowering vines, urban trees with colorful fruits, flowers in rocky plains, and underwater coastal/reef kelp-like forests.",1475280004

I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw a floating orb just a little bit past where the light didn't reach. I was scared shitless. I honestly didn't know what to do, and then it started to approach me. I just stood there in shock, when it finally came under the light, and it was just a big black dog with a giant white spot on it's side.

Instead we're told to use merino or cotton for sleeping and to use multiple layers if it's cold (e.g. merino singlet, cotton sleeper, merino sleep sack). 

One of our government research institutes, AgResearch, released a report in 2010 comparing a merino sleeping bag with a Halo polyester/fleece sleeping bag and concluded that the merino sleeping bag was a better choice. The [report is here](https://www.ikbenmama.nl/images/merino_onderzoek.pdf) if you want to read it.

"truezelda","t5_2tfzp","&gt;It's my way of making sense of the different groups throughout the series which share many similarities. I know it's not perfect and I don't claim that it's true canon, but for now it ties everything together in a way that I think makes sense.  

my issue with this theory, and many theories like it...  

Why does ALL need to be connected ?  
Like, you connect the shadow tribe responsible for Majora's Mask, the Twili, Groose and his descendants, the increase in tech magic (I presume to explain the BotW stuff that is upcoming), the wind tribe, the oocca and so forth.... 

While none of those things have ANY connection to each other.  
Like, the connecting theories between the sheikah, Dark interloppers and shadow tribe have always been limited too : their stuff have eyes in their design/their stuff involves hiding your face.    
Aside from that there is nothing even remotely linking them.  
The rest of the stuff you pull into it have even less.  

I just don't see why anyone should start from the thinking point of : ""How am I gonna connect all of these?""  
Hell, to point at something you refer to in this post : Serb's map of the cosmos wasn't made with the idea of ""connect all the alternate worlds together""  
It was created cause he came to the conclusion that (in his view of things) it would make the most sense if it all WAS connected/the same world.  

.

I know I'm not really answering the shadow magic question (on that topic, I think it ""shadow"" is just an ""element"" or ""school"" of magic like any other)  but yeah, just wanted to state my confusion with theories like this that (As far as I see it) just connect a shit ton of stuff first, and then try to make it work",1475280008

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","FYI for those scrolling the comments... this comment by /u/Piroko is very explanatory and may shed some light on why this decision may not be as bad as it sounds (though it still sounds *quite* shady and sketchy to me)

&gt;
&gt;So, THEORETICALLY, the US Department of Commerce ""owns"" the right to name who is the IANA (internet assigned numbers authority). ICANN (internet corporation for assigned names and numbers) holds the IANA role under contract from the US government and has for 18 years.

&gt;This situation came about because 20 years ago, NSFNET (national science foundation network) provided MOST of the backbone capacity for the internet. The USCISI (university of southern california information sciences institute) acted as the master bgp route table.

&gt;However, the job began to balloon as the internet grew and there was some grumblings of power games at USCISI and NetSol (Network Solutions) so the IANA role was created and contracted to ICANN.

&gt;Fast forward to today.

&gt;For nearly two decades, ICANN and the (now) five RIRs have done a pretty good job of managing the internet and the master bgp table. They've been fair to all parties involved, have generally strived to make the IETF's improvements happen, cooperated with the ITU (international telecommunications union), etc.

&gt;But every two years they still have to renegotiate with the US government to continue to be the IANA.

&gt;But why?

&gt;What power does the US government have over them now?
NSFNET is gone. ARPANET is LONG gone. Even the Abilene network (which was awesome when I was in college) has faded away as just one more link. The days when the government could claim to be a backbone provider are decades past.

&gt;If for some political reason the US government decided to try to leverage its hypothetical power over ICANN, what 
the hell could the US government possibly do if ICANN simply refused to work with them? Shut them down?

&gt;The AS'es (autonomous systems; that is, individual networks) all listen to ICANN. The stability of the internet depends on SOMEONE being the master bgp table, and ICANN has done a pretty good job of it. Only one bgp table in the entire world can be canonical. The rest are just merely ""eventually consistent"".
Shut ICANN down and who's bgp table becomes canonical? The one the US government says?

&gt;Or the one the ITU says? Mind you, the ITU is a UN agency all worldwide telecommunications providers ALREADY cooperate with.
What would happen if the US government tried to wield its power, is that the ITU would walk in, name someone as the worldwide master bgp table, and that would be the end of it. With a pen stroke the US government would be written out of the picture, BECAUSE THEY ALREADY ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE. They aren't a major backbone provider.

&gt;The tier 1 networks, the backbone providers, ALREADY listen to the ITU for matters of standardization. Its the ITU that tells them what orbits are safe for their comm satellites, what frequencies are safe for their microwave relays.",1475280008

Imagine he lets them leave. Think of this headline instead ""Trump claims to make the 'Best Deals' yet lets tenant breach contract and vacate lease!"" or ""Trump SLAMMED by restaurant owner!"" Then the article says something like ""Trump says he'll fight for the American people, but won't even fight for his own business. How can voters expect him to make deals with foreign powers when he can't even take on his own tenants?"" 

You can paint this however you want depending on how you report on it. It boils down to Trump is a businessman first, a politician second. That's why he has the support that he has. If he stops caring about his business because he's campaigning that can show weakness.

"EMV","t5_3aj0a","I don't work in the industry, but as far as I know, EMV is EMV, so you're covered from the liability shift protection as long as the chip is used, whether or not its done in sight of the customer. The customer can always dispute the transaction, but I'd think that as long as you're dipping the chip, it will be the standard dispute process rather than the automatic incontestable chargeback. I would think you'd be able to ask your processor if customer-visible dipping is required for full liability coverage.

The current American system seems perfectly normal to us Americans, but in the past I've seen several conversions with foreigners who are completely aghast at the idea. In some countries it's unusual for an employee to even touch a customer's card, let alone walk away with it. 

When you start to think about it, there are two significant problems with the American system. One is that the card leaves the customer's sight, so the server can do whatever they want with it. Whether or not you use EMV, there's nothing to stop a malicious employee from running the card through a second fake reader that just captures the magnetic stripe details for later cloning; until magstripe use becomes as rare in the US as it is in other countries, that still has the potential to be an attractive fraud route. The second is the manual addition of tips later creates an opening for both innocent mistakes and intentional tip fraud.

I agree that there's the potential for social awkwardness of having the server hovering over the customer while they're deciding on a tip amount. As someone who has done a fair bit of international travel, I lean towards saying just do it and eventually we Americans will get over it. I remember in Canada the portable terminals had options to select e.g. 15%, 18%, or 20%, or enter a custom amount. So that makes it quick to just hit a button and get on with it. I'd be curious to find out how many people really give it much thought how much they want to tip each time and how many people just basically tip 15% or 20% nearly every time unless the service was exceptionally good or bad.

There was also one restaurant in Norway that actually left the portable terminal at my table while I paid while the waitress attended to another task, and I also saw her do it with other customers.

You could also go to the extreme and adopt a ""no tipping"" model and just increase prices and salaries accordingly; I've heard a few US restaurants have done this.

It actually sounds like your Pax S90 device is a decent solution. Just because it's portable doesn't mean you have to do table-side payments. As long as you can do Chip and Signature (either with signature preferring cards or PIN-bypass) and add the tip later, you can keep doing things the way you always have. But if you do run into a card that requires a PIN, then you can easily bring the terminal back to the customer so they can enter tip and PIN.

I have run into that. A couple of restaurants in Italy asked me if my card was PIN or signature, and after I said signature they took the card away American style and brought back the receipt for me to sign. And one place in London took the card away and somehow managed to get my signature preferring (but PIN-capable) card to do a Chip and PIN transaction and brought the portable terminal and card back to the table for me to enter the PIN.

One final thought (for now anyway) is that there is some speculation that US banks might be using Chip and Signature as an interim step and will eventually move to Chip and PIN. If that happens, adopting a portable terminal now would prevent another equipment change, especially if they take away the ability to do PIN bypass (as I hear happened in Australia a year or so ago).",1475280014

Elementary and high school is pretty ineffective at teaching critical thinking. College pretty much is, too. And all they care about is GPA, for entrance requirements and scholarships. If you got good marks in high school, doesn't matter about anything else.

The only way to really get an education is through experience. An undergraduate degree doesn't fully qualify as that experience, but it can be a real slap in the face. He might have sailed through so far, but the work load and difficulty is about to ramp up quite a bit.

Thankfully, if he wants to become an astrophysicist he'll have to do grad studies and do actual, real work in the lab.

^ I do see his first point though, that there really isn't a 'correct' way to do this without asking constantly for consent every single step of the way, which I'd imagine to most people wouldn't be the norm

This might just be because the really top people just don't want to relocate, is this true? It might also be because they end up admitting a lot more people. 

Also, how is the general PhD structure compared to US universities? The duration of the PhD is much shorter but does that mean that a PhD at Cambridge would look similar to the last three years of a PhD in the US or are there other differences?",1475280015

We did talk before getting married. He was firm on no joining of finances that he'd take care of his own stuff.

It's either sidewalk or get run-over by a semi in some places by drivers who refuse to acknowledge cyclists as vehicles in their own right with ""rights"" to be in the lane. Cycling isn't considered a legitimate form of transportation here, so people are more likely to get mad at you being on the road than on the sidewalks.

It's fuckshit, I know. Add to that a system of greenways that act as sidewalks in parts of the city and the line gets even more blurred.

The second one is worse. The writer has no idea what an appositive is. It should read, ""For her part, Google SVP of Cloud, Diane Greene, says ..."" Also, in formal writing you never use contractions. ""She's"" should be ""she is."" Again proud and unprecedented should not be in quotes.

"nyancoins","t5_2zr4g","As title says, this is a crosspost from [the buttcoin post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/55328x/the_disaster_that_is_bitcoin/). This is a great example of how immature and vulnerable Bitcoin is. It's not that the other cryptocurrencies are better today. It's that Bitcoin hasn't built up a solid infrastructure of services. If another coin (say, DOGE, in a fantasy world) were to do so, I think it could easily overtake Bitcoin if it could get easier ""on-ramps"" and ""off-ramps"".

This is *not* a place where I expect to see NYAN compete. I expect us to focus on crypto-to-crypto trade. We don't have the size to be able to effectively launch such services, as a key hurdle. I'm also not sure if we want to increase our exposure to regulation and visibility in that way.

Defending yourself doesn't change their mind, it just saps your energy. Stop struggling to make them like you.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I'm not downplaying people who have chronic pain. I recognize there are a lot of people who have to deal with pain on an everyday basis but can't find relief. But the topic being discussed is people killing ""big pharm"" and physicians for overprescribing narcotic painkillers. Here's a secret: No well-meaning physician wants their patients to rely on painkillers. So many people who have no idea about health care think that physicians just hand it out like candy and would rather treat patients that way. The fact is that a lot of patients develop chronic pain and a fair percentage (read: NOT ALL) want instant relief rather than to work on a sustainable plan for that chronic pain.

So you have this group of people who bitch at physicians for getting people addicted to painkillers, even though it's at the patient's request that they be started on painkillers to deal with chronic pain. And then you have people similar to you who have legitimate chronic pain that requires a regimen of pain medication but know how to not let it control your lives, where physical therapy and other methods alone aren't effective.

I'm early 30's, have an awesome hubby, and am 35 weeks pregnant with our first kiddo. We compliment each other beautifully and he's going to be a fantastic daddy to our little girl. 

This entire pregnancy has been an exercise in rumination. Taking inventory of the things that happened to me. Committing to myself and our daughter that her earliest memories won't be rooted in terror like mine, or loneliness like his. Shoring up boundaries with my dad. He's older and more frail and can't do much physical damage to me anymore, but he could still do a lot of harm to my daughter. He's still very disrespectful and emotionally toxic. I actually had it out with him over the past few days via email exchange, which I summarized in today's sticky. I don't really know why I'm still even VLC with him. He's teetering the cliff of going back full NC. I would never treat my daughter like he continues to treat me. I don't get it.

I don't have much reading material advice except Toxic Parents and similar books. Toxic Parents was the source of my epiphany that the way my dad treated me wasn't normal or ok.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You gotta do you, man! And I mean that. I've gone years between dates even, because finding a relationship just to be dating someone wasn't my priority at the time. And you are correct, losing weight is directly related to how you eat and how you move. That's the case for every living thing on this planet. Long term results require long term changes.

If cardio is something you enjoy, that's great! There are a lot of really fun options out there. You might find, though, that you can get more out of the cardio if you supplement with weight training. For example, I want to be able to run a mile in a not laughable amount of time one day, but I have a lot of pain in my knees from an old injury. So with my doctor's advice and a trainer's help, I do exercises to develop strength in my knees, keeping them more stable and reducing the pain. It works!

As for the science classes taking up your time, I'm not entirely sure how my boyfriend got a science PhD while also spending hours in the gym. Honestly sounds like he didn't sleep for five years to me, poor man. That's definitely not for everyone. But to him, it was important to make his training a priority, and it still is.

We get out there, do our thing. Come to find out, it's three MPs on a HMMWV. None of the MILES gear works, there's six Bradleys with dismounts all over the place. We have to go PEW PEW PEW and the BC has to scream ""YOU FUCKERS ARE DEAD"" at the MPs.

So we just spent five hours searching for one truck and we can't even simulate taking them out? Thanks LT. Glad you were so enthusiastic when you basically lied to us.

&gt;**Unidentified speaker**
I have too much respect to do that. But, this summer the dea was looking to reschedule the class of marijuana specifically with regard to medicalmarijuana so institutions could do more research. And we have seen that many children with epilepsy have dealt with the effects of cdc. Many times when the question has been asked of your mother, she has not been as pacific about where she might stand about rescheduling marijuana. I wonder if you have any more information? 00:21:38


&gt;**Chelsea Clinton:**
she has been clear so I am sorry you felt she hasn't been. Please go to her website. One of the challenges with the experiments happeningaround the country at the state level, and she supports states in making whatever decision is right for them, is that we have no real way to study them. So anecdotally we have a lot of evidence in the area you talked about, in epilepsy, autism, in a stimulating appetite for people that are on intensive chemotherapy regimen, for people who have non-epilepsy leisure disorders and challenges, that we also have and it dead -- anecdotal evidence from colorado where some of the people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the corner believed after they die that there was drug interaction with other things they were taking. One of the reasons we need rigorous studying is that we want to know where it works and where it does not because probably there are some areas where it works and areas where it does not. One of the reasons the fda has such rigorous testing and one of the reasons our fda approval process is the gold standard for the world is the rigorous study of new drugs and how they interact with over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs. That is why when we get a prescription, there are warnings . Some are really explicit instructions. If you are taking these four rugs, please note your doctor knows that before you start this prescription. We just need so much more data than we have so that people who might benefit have a chance to benefit. People who might be in danger are protected. My mom strongly support the need for more rigorous study and addressing everything that may have medicinal purpose.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; About #3, doesn't that run the risk of ad hominem and prejudice,
rather than considering the merits (or non-merits) of the position that person holds?


There's plenty of places in both the old and new testaments where we are instructed to avoid false teachers -- this doesn't only mean false teach-ings, but teach-ers. Admittedly this might be more related to application (a false teacher will mainly tell you to apply true doctrine in an untrue manner) than actual theology, which your question relates to.

A very stark example is a teaching coming from the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Science and Reason compared to one coming from e.g. John Piper. Even if both offer an explanation that's textually and logically sound, credence should be given to the faithful believer rather than those who openly wage war against God.

&gt; is the past popularity or non-popularity relevant to whether a position is within orthodoxy or is heretical? Some popularly-held positions may be false while less-popularly-held positions may be true.

I would say relevant but not necessarily decisive. It's important to understand why people understood what they did; though we're not forced to agree with it. Specifically, we need to uncover the biblical truth (if any) which would be the underlying reason for a specific custom or teaching. I don't know who I'll trigger, but consider the EFS hierarchy-in-trinity discussion.

I do like the Amagi's shell arcs, probably because I suck at aiming.

I'm only at the New Mexico in the USN battleship line.  I might grind that line more if it weren't for the fact that there are just too damn many battleships lately.  Four is a lot, and five is too many, and I see four or five in nearly every game at most tiers now--five may even be more common.

LUFS is more on the mid range side, while RMS is more bass heavy. So a song with a real big bass will have a higher RMS vs a song that doesn't. But their LUFS might still be very close to each other because of how loud other frequencies are. Also reference tracks with both to get a better measurement of your tracks loudness. ",1475280033

Off the back of this we then get the people CC'd forwarding the message to our ticket system themselves, only it then gets logged under their username instead of original person.

The net result of this is about 6 tickets raised for the same issue, &lt;itticketemail&gt; copied into the back and forth between the user and the many people CC'd - 6 tickets on the go, a handful of them updated with each response, impossible to keep track of all the communication and me banging my head on the desk trying to merge all the tickets together and deal with the backlash of complaints ""why is this taking so long to resolve""? Err... because there's 6 tickets open for it and 25 back and forth emails to all the people CC'd so I don't know what is intended for IT and what isn't.

Trusting something if you already know what the truth is, is easy, because you already know. I guess the point is doing what it is difficult (believe, blindly obey, have faith, etc) because you are never sure if what you believe in is true. If you are intelligent -an educated person without indoctrination from parents, church, society, etc- and you still choose to believe, you are actually doing something very difficult, because once you escape indoctrination and you become an skeptical, it's really hard to believe in anything, you can't believe anymore because now you need to know (you need evidence). If you are that kind of person, a science person or someone without indoctrination, and you still choose to believe, you are surrendering yourself to the insecurity of never know, and that -for that kind of person- is difficult as hell.

"91Days","t5_3fedf","I... wow. What a ride it's been.

I'm blown away by how great and emotional the finale was. Angelo got his revenge but realized the futility of it once the entire ordeal was over and since Corteo is no longer with him. Nero is furious, but stays patient enough to find out exactly why his right-hand man had gone to such lengths to betray him. Angelo and Nero are incredible characters, and they have such a dynamic relationship. The heartbreaking scene where Nero and Angelo yell at each other, a grief-stricken, miserable Angelo cries, and Nero realizes his pain and sympathizes with him... what a fucking fantastically tragic moment. Perhaps my favorite scene of the series. It was sadly nostalgic to see them driving together again, as if they were close bros again. For a minute I thought they were actually going to drive off into the sunset together or something to live their new, free lives, haha... In another life, I feel like maybe these two would have been great friends, because they have incredible chemistry. They were each other's reason to live, even if just for a little while, and neither of them wanted to kill the other because of their sentimental attachment. And then of course, the very end of the episode. I absolutely love how they ended the series-- they tied up pretty much all loose ends, except for this very last moment which is intentionally ambiguous and open to interpretation. What's up with that final shot of the revolver, the footprints in the sand, and the can of pineapples? What happened to Angelo? How will Nero (and Angelo, if he's still alive) go forward from here? I'll probably have to rewatch this episode (when the dub comes out!) to draw any sort of coherent conclusion, but for right now, I applaud the people who worked on this anime-- the story of 91 Days was fascinating and well done to the bitter end.",1475280036

Fiberglass batting is normally used by builders who just want to build to code. Think builder grade. 
Cellulose is treated paper, and when blown in properly, gives the best insulation efficiency around. 
It doesn't compact, leaving spaces at the top or sides over time like other methods do. 

As for pricing, it will cost more initially, but over the next five years, your heating and cooling bill will be lower, so you'll have a return on your investment through those lower bills.

How much of an impact does humanity and our industry real have? Who and what organization, company, or country stands to benefit, and lose from this? These are all fundamental issues to the debate.

&gt;So you are going to tell us how to suck carbon out of the atmosphere u/Chewybunny ? 

First I wouldn't villify CO2 exclusively. However, if *ARE* going to start dealing with CO2:
Begin by instituting re-foresting initiatives, invest resources and money into sustainability, and genetic modification for plants to be able to withstand climate conditions better, and be heartier, and absorb t he CO2. This can be done vie tax credits, economic incentives, and much more without having to cripple our economies.

&gt;You are going to tell us how society can continue on without increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere?

No, because that's an impossibility. It's a pipe dream. What I will tell you is that sustainability, adaptability, and a transformation of our infrastructure, and the infrastructure of other countries IS possible, IS real, and IS cost-effective.

&gt;God you science deniers are morons.

No one is denying science. I am however skeptical about the fear-mongering in the face of so many political, economical, social and ecological elements that compose the debate.

"nvidia","t5_2rlgy","Depending on your recording settings (resolution and bitrate) you can see a difference of 1%-10% gpu usage. Figure recording at native resolution and very high bitrate, likely in the 7-10% ballpark range. That's a very real amount of GPU power to give up. How many frames could that be? Depends on how GPU intensive the game is. Something like DOOM where a 1070 will hit 140-200 fps at 1080p, probably just a few. Something like Witcher 3 at 2560x1440? Could be the difference between a locked 60 and dips into the 50s. Experiment and find what's more important for you.

2-Si corre riesgo la vida o los bienes, es defensa propia, eso no es venganza, y lo determina la justicia. Si el delincuente no est√° en una situaci√≥n donde este hace peligrar tu vida, a tu familia o a tus bienes (ejemplo, si ubicas donde vive para matarlo, o lo linchan) es venganza. 

3- La gente lo considera justicia gracias a la ausencia del estado tanto en integraci√≥n como en castigo de los delincuentes, no est√° bien correr a un tipo y reventarlo contra un poste, pero tampoco est√° bien que el tenga derecho a escapar con tus bienes/dinero, a pesar de que no est√© en riesgo la vida propia la defensa de la propiedad privada tiene que ser un derecho de todo ciudadano, cosa que hoy en d√≠a no hay en la Argentina (o hay y no se cumple). Esto tambi√©n se debe a la ausencia del estado en el √°mbito de la educaci√≥n y al sistema penitenciario, que solo empeora la situaci√≥n de los delincuentes.

"DJs","t5_2rddy","Thanks. I'm looking to put together a repeatable workflow that allows for a good continuous flow of tracks, along with the ability to live loop and compose in tandem, ideally within programs itself. Both Traktor and Serato now have Link, which solves with the tempo synch. It's having a robust production suite that allows for deep dive if I want it, but presenting me with an interface that keeps me in the flow. 

Really what's missing is Live having decent library management. Most guys who use Live set up their track list before hand in session view, but I feel this is a little too 'on rails' if you want to switch up your set in response to the crowd or your mood. ",1475280041

I've talked about this issue with quite a few friends and colleagues, many of whom are or are going to be scientists, and also had one or two debates about it here on reddit. The majority of the people haven't even given the topic much of a thought, even though epistemological theory is at the very core of the practice of science and absolutely essential to being able to properly write about it.

Most of the time, people then simply default to an objectivist point of view (i.e. scientifically established models are objectively and precisely describing a given aspect of reality).

I can't understand people being against education or practical things like clean needle dispensation. People are doing the drugs and there is no way to fix addiction. That would mean being able to fix the reasons people do drugs, which is very very hard. Curbing the ill-effects of addiction is very possible and way easier than ending addiction. However, society has to get past the stigma of addiction and focus on the addict as person worth more than disdain or disgust.

"parrots","t5_2qhyf","I'm also not here to argue with you personally, I only wish to offer an opposing opinion to the heated ""pellet debate"". As a parrot fanatic AND scientists it often disturbs me to see many of the rumors flying around the web regarding parrot care and especially nutrition. More often than not the information we read is anecdotal, speculation, or gross exaggeration used by individuals to further their self-interests. 

For example
&gt;Not to disagree with anyone, but I wouldn't feed more than 50% pellets.

What is your reasoning behind this statement? A recent study published by Brightsmith (2012) examined the nutritional composition of ""mixed"" diets. Amazons were fed diets made up of 3 different ratios A) 50% produce, 25% pellets, 25% seed, B) 60% pellets, 22% produce, 18% seed, and C) 75% pellets, 25% produce. The only diets that fulfilled the nutritional needs (both macro and micro) of these birds were diets B and C. Even so, birds still selectively consumed more fat than recommended with diet B, mostly because they selectively ate the seed mix first before. Diet A was shown to not only encourage the consumption of excess fat, but was deficient in many nutrients including calcium and trace minerals. 

This logic follows numerous studies which have determined that birds fed pellet-only diets remain at optimal health for many years. So again, I'm not advocating that people should ONLY be feeding 100% pellets. I personally only feed 25% or less pellets to my birds BUT because instead I like to offer a large variety of fresh sprouts/veggies/cooked mixes/treats I am extremely cognizant of the fact that I *cannot* accurately assess the precise nutrition my bird requires or is receiving and so supplement with additional protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals accordingly. 

I think this is an *extremely* important point for people to remember, especially those people recommending that birds be fed a mostly fresh diet. Unless you have a fantastically unpicky eater, and unless you are providing the appropriate proportions of all the necessary vitamins, minerals, and macro nutrients, pellets are simply the easiest way to ensure that a bird is receiving the adequate nutrition. For this reason people should not be discouraged from feeding a diet up to 75% pellets, unless like you or me they are motivated to put a lot of time and effort into preparing a nutritionally complete fresh diet. Even so, they should refer to a qualified avian vet or nutritionist to cater to their bird's particular needs. 

This is just one example out of the multitude of black-and-white ""claims"" that riddle the parrot husbandry world. A couple comments I'll make regarding your accusations against Harrison's is that unlike TOPs and Goldenfeast this food has been formulated and studied by avian nutritionists for decades now. When you can show me additional SCIENCE that refutes their claims (including the ones written [here](http://www.harrisonsbirdfoods.com/a-question-about-soy/)) then I would be happy to change my opinions. But even though I do not use this food I respect the research that has gone into it. For the record, their suggestion that overweight birds be fed High Potency pellets contains a caveat * that this is due to the fact that birds can eat less total volume of the food product and still receive comparable nutrition when compared to the Lifetime diet. So the total calories injected would be less, leading to eventual weight loss (in theory). They also state that food amounts should be monitored in accordance to a bird's weight and so admit that each individual may react different to the diet. Finally, the High Potency's protein content (20%) is hardly considered ""high"" compared to the 17.5% of Goldenobles. In addition, there is no evidence that these protein/fat levels (20 and 12% respectively) contribute to or exacerbate kidney issues OR fatty liver disease. The types of diets proven to cause fatty livers are typically seed-based with a high proportion of oily seeds (e.g. sunflower with a fat ratio of 60%).

FWIW I was in a boat similar to you many years ago when I first started studying avian husbandry. I know how easy it is to fall into the speculation, accusations, and assumptions made by people about ingredients like corn, soy, or wheat, as well as what is a ""correct"" diets. What I learned eventually is we know for certain very little. So there is nothing wrong with feeding your birds in a manner that fits your own moral or health orientations (e.g. organic, GMO free, mostly raw) but there is also nothing wrong with feeding mostly pellets to ensure well-rounded nutrition, etc. ",1475280045

And trading the young core that made it to the 2nd round. But then he flips them for Shaq and pulls of the largest trade in league history. It's ballsy moves like that when you realize he knows what he's doing. More importantly he's built a strong front office that makes the tough decisions, the unpopular ones.

I thought God was supposed to be good so why are there so many bad things happenning in the world? Also nothing seemed to change or really happen for the better when I did pray to God. Furthermore, I started to have the whole ""seeing is believing"" mindset and I realized I was gay and a lot of religions were against gayness.

The Mario sky is indeed somewhat purpleish in the output coming out of the NES, but your CRT may have disregarded the low red values in the channel and made it more blue. However, to adjust the palette to match what everyone's memories are is an impossible task, so instead he matched to directly what comes out of the composite signal. 

For NESRGB's using Firebrand's palette and hooked up to a CRT this solves all problems, since it's identical to the composite output and the CRT will do with it whatever that CRT does. However for digital signals on HDTVs like this, it's anyone's guess as to what's authentic. The thing that makes this really interesting though is that there's an interview with Miyamoto where he specifically says he picked the more purple-ish blue for Mario's sky out of all the blues on the system because it felt the most natural to him.

"glutenfree","t5_2qx1l","Honestly it sounds like you should try a few experiments.

First, cut gluten completely out of your diet. Go 100% for a week or two - however long you can handle it, but certainly at least a week. Now either eat a big bowl of pasta and see what happens, OR slowly reintroduce gluten into your diet and see what happens. If you slowly reintroduce gluten, keep adding more into your diet until you get to your ""normal"" intake. 

Or, you can try cutting out 50%-70% of gluten from your diet, and see if you still get the shits. 

A low gluten diet may work for you. For your sake, I hope it does! You might be able to get away with eating 1 piece of pizza but not 4, or only be able to get away with a beer now and then. Soy sauce may or may not bother you. Whole wheat/low gluten breads might be ok while white/high gluten bread isn't. It might be that your body does better with highly processed (read: ""simple"", easy to break down) carbs/proteins, or it might be that your body does better with less processed (read: more ""whole"", naturally occurring) carbs/proteins. 

You should also check out supplements like Glutenease. It doesn't work for me, but a friend of mine with non-celiac wheat sensitivity swears by it. She takes it with wheat/gluten containing foods or with risky foods (like a restaurant meal where there might be cross contamination). As a result she doesn't shit her pants when she's accidentally served soy sauce instead of gluten free tamari, but she still gets a it bloated and tired-feeling. But it's a god send for those of us who struggle to stay strictly GF or who can handle a little gluten but not a lot. 

Personally, if you can live comfortably and not create any intestinal damage while still eating gluten, I say go for it. But I'm a foodie, so giving up real pizza and croissants for the past 6 years makes me want to cry whenever I think about it. And travel fucking sucks because merely eating is a chore and stressful. So if you can get away with a little gluten cheating, I say do it. ",1475280048

Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down\.She intends to change a single moment in time \- and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain\. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price\.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death?

"canada","t5_2qh68","Storage. You can compress NG and you can't compress oil. There's a giant storage facility for oil in Oklahoma where all the pipelines meet and it only stores a few days worth of production. NG prices are very volatile, way more so than oil prices are. Increased price volatility and easier storage means it is much more viable to store and sell at opportune times. 

Read my post. I said a lot of SAGD did get shut down and hasn't restarted. You point out that I am wrong, and then in the very next paragraph you say lots of SAGD project got shut down. No shit. That's what I just said. They got shut down because they were only viable at $90/bbl and they weren't making money. If there is a short dip below their breakeven level they will ride it out at a small loss because it costs a shit ton of money to shut down and restart. They forecast a long deep drop in prices so it made economic sense to take that huge hit rather than to keep operating at a loss. 

It is cheaper to keep operating than to start and stop, even if you have to operate at a loss, so long as the price differential between spot and breakeven isn't too large for too long. 

SAGD kept operating at a loss for a little while until it became apparent that the price differential was going to be big and for a long time. Then they got shut down and haven't been restarted. 

NG doesn't suffer as badly from this because you can compress and store it cheaply and because prices are so volatile - it won't get and stay low forever. The big change to this lately is all the fracking that is going on is producing a lot of extra NG which hasn't happened before. NG may stay low for a longer time now. 

You could try reading and not just defaulting to being such a dick next time. No one was calling anyone names until you offended yourself with your poor reading comprehension. ",1475280052

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Every one of those kids deserves a shot. You may not be the best judge of whether or not one of your developmentally disabled classmates is thriving. One-on-one instruction may work for some kids, but most really are better off being with their peers most of the time.  Shared peer experiences matter a great deal - it's one of the foundations of developmental psychology.

My fairly profoundly autistic brother was the first autistic student to complete public K-12 in Texas. He then got a degree in computer science. He has an office job at a school, where he's appreciated and liked. 

When he started elementary school, they tried to force him into special ed... problem is, he has always been smart, just different (nonverbal til age 4, poor coordination, required physical and speech therapy, continues to have little interest in people, is sensitive to touch, scent, and sound, and on and on) My Mom wasn't going to let a kid she knew was smart get trapped in the hell that is the special ed classroom. I hate to think how his life would be different if my Mom hadn't fought for a pilot program at the elementary school (my brother was born in the 80s, so no one knew what to do with autism)... At the best possible time, we got a new vice principal. She met with my family, and she said, ""Why not try?"" So she asked her kindergarten teachers which of them wanted a challenge, and assigned a classroom aid to him for the first two years. (The advantages of a college town) After that he was on his own as just another member of the class. But the VP always asked the teachers before the beginning of the next year, which of them wanted my brother as a student. I think that was a stroke of genius on her part, and should definitely be part of how schools manage special needs students in the classroom.

Did it help to socialize my bro? Quite a bit, yes. Not in the ways most people expected it to, but certainly in ways that are meaningful and allow him to live a better life. Did he come out ahead of the curve, or about average, in all subjects, most of the time? Yep. However, had you asked his classmates how he was as a student, I doubt very many would have guessed his grades were better than theirs.

The experts who have worked with him agree that had he been placed in special ed, with children who suffer from severe retardation, he would seem like a person with severe retardation. Instead he leads a semi-normal life and communicates very well.

By the time he reached high school, a counselor asked Mom how my brother had gone from profound disability from an early age, to such a high degree of function.

She was a little surprised he didn't already get it. She answered that she treated him like her son, and that his older siblings treated him like a younger brother - both protecting him and picking on him. His classmates were about the same. He had chores and expectations at home. He went to school and did his homework. He played video games and watched movies and was never left out of activities with us (well - very very rarely, but only to protect his safety). 

So, I guess I would say that you're probably underestimating many developmentally delayed and/or disabled people. How can you tell what they're getting from the class? Especially those who act very differently, and don't communicate well verbally? Are you telling me you can interpret children whose own families find them difficult to understand? If so, might I suggest you go into early childhood education, because it's quite a rare skill to have!

Otherwise, maybe let they, their teachers, and their families be the judge of how well standard class learning is working for them.",1475280053

**Hostels:** Try to stay at one that has free breakfast. Lots of backpackers take advantage of this and it's easy to start a convo with someone and make plans for the day!

**Free Walking Tours:** Pretty much every major city has ""free"" (tip your guide!) walking tours. your hostel should be able to give you info. you're going to have to go out of your way and strike conversation with people. some walking tours will have everyone introduce themselves and say where they're from, which makes it easier to talk to others. some tour guides offer to have lunch as a group after the tour- this is a great way to meet others, especially solo travelers. And if not, you could always ask the group if anyone is going to lunch and if you can tag along.

**Couchsurfing:** my personal rule was that that they had to have a review from a a couple women before I considered asking them to crash. But, it's not fullproof. One guy I couchsurfed with only had a couple reviews, but I felt good vibes and went with it. he was super amazing! A really great host and person. And then I had a couple people who had multiple great reviews, but were only hitting on me. So, YMMV. But, when do you get someone great, it really enhances your experience by truly immersing yourself in their culture! and you get a local to ask all your questions to :)",1475280057

I had so much fun in metal shop. Lighting shit on fire with the torch, cutting table legs off, welding massive dick sculptures, welding the tables together, or tacking other people's personal projects together, etc. We had a big ass CNC machine and we made a 3' x 3' dick cutout. Shit, we even smelted something like 1200 pennies and also made a (you guessed it) copper penis. Not me but another kid took the teachers extra pair of boots and melted them with a torch. His punishment was he had to clean out the spit sink (a sink we all spit out snuff into) it was fucking vile. I had to do it once too. The teacher didn't give a fuck, we had zero actual assignments and zero safety though. He only cared about the extracurricular UIL stuff (land judging, live stock judging, FFA, welding, barrel racing, meat judging, entomology, etc, etc, etc). There were over 20 more things you could compete in, we had so much AG stuff. He just sat in his office and was pervy as fuck. Hitting on all the hot girls in AG stuff and just hanging out in his office with them all class. Fuck I had so much fun in that class. 

Honestly my school had for the most part excellent and engaging teachers. I only had one of two ""memorize for the test"" teachers. We had a lot of really great college credit classes and programs to help you prepare for and actual career. Looking back on it I went to a damn good high school. It was brand new, only 7 years old when I graduated. High school was a damn good time. Sorry for the length. But thinking back to metal shop I just remembered all the funny ass shit we did in there. It was anarchy and we were super lucky nobody got hurt though.

The job is to *represent* people. Obviously, there is interpretive leeway, but in general, it is much farther from a democracy for *representatives* to contradict the interests they *represent*. Which is why you better have a damn good reason if you choose a different tract.

I'm rather confused ultimately what you're trying to say; my point is that ""doing what's right against the will of the voter"" is an extremely slippery slope, and not something we should ever want to get used to as standard practice. ""What's right"" is much more subjective than ""what my constituents want"".

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I'd say the semantics of 'how many encounters it is' is somewhat irrelevant here regardless of xp calculation, so I'm fine to not argue that point. I do agree it's an endurance thing, especially since it's a sprint through assuming without rests. As for the discrepancy between solo encounters and group encounters, that's likely due to both the action economy and the versatility of an encounter.

A group facing a solo monster has one set of problems to deal with from a single source. Even if that source is powerful, if the party locks it down they've got it handled. Multiple opponents and thus multiple sources of output means crowd and terrain control is required, as well as more types of output to deal with. In the four types of elementals, all of them make two attacks with their multiattack feature. The air and water elementals then have unique abilities, and then the fire and air elementals have speeds which outpace most players and their movement (a level 4 Monk with mobile could match the fire elemental, but not the air elemental of course).

Given that most of the elementals are raw damage and the two with unique are on recharge with only one serving as a persistent crowd control, the players have very little they need to adapt to. For a party of PCs of equivalent level (5-6), this encounter would be reasonably straightforward, unless the DM used the battlefield to make use of the elementals with where they appear and using their abilities to more effect than provided. For example, the fire elemental emerges from the bonfire, the air elemental appears once the fire elemental is killed and uses its Whirlwind to smack a party member into the flames, or the water elemental uses Whelm and dives back into a lake.

This is based on my experience of the game, of course, and so dependent on the party build this might be incorrect in some ways.",1475280067

I'm kinda on his side of this - my SO got a great job in a much larger city, I have one year left of my online masters program so I thought hey this would be cool to move in together and see how it goes. I'm so bored. To tears. He works an IT job and i was unemployed for a month looking for career focused jobs before I got a retail job just because I needed money. I learned rather quickly I don't have any hobbies - I use to hang out with my sisters and work for my mom and watch tv. The weather was too hot here and I'm rather lazy so I didn't want to go explore the city or anything, I watched some Netflix but that gets old. My BF has tried to get me to play his video games but I'm just not into them. So the point of saying all that is I didn't think it would be frustrating for him, and although I don't know if he feels guilty about the move, it makes me see things in a different light. I'm still really bored - sorry for the no solution - but on my really bad days I try and take a walk outside to get some fresh air. I feel crummy a lot because I almost feel worthless - my SO is paying rent and working hard and saving money and I'm paying the bills but I'm pay check to pay check. He's got friends at work and I'm so happy when he goes out with them after work but I'm just sitting at home because I really have a hard time going into social environments alone and I'm pretty strapped for money. My dog helps though - gets me out sometimes. 

Anyway I just wanted to say thanks for showing your perspective because it's helpful and I'm sorry - but you also shouldn't feel extremely guilty because he's still making those decisions himself. I'm glad you're being supportive but let him find his own weight. ",1475280068

But that's equivalent to saying that soccer goalie scoring on himself 20 times and then blocking a shot was a 'good move'. 

It was a good crisis management move maybe. But that's not important. What is much more important is why laws were changed to even allow 2008 to happen. And the answer is that the banking industry, over lots of money and time spent, effectively has control over setting banking regulations and since then it is doomed to backfire. 

Laws haven't changed all that much since 2008. There will be a worse meltdown coming, and its not that far off either.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Venezuela is an interesting case. Firstly, it was a high prospective growth, high inequality country, so communism may have damaged its capacity for growth. Furthermore, Venezuela has a famously unstable economy and poor civil rights history that significantly predates the rise of Chavez. It is possible that at least some of Venezuela's current and recent difficulties would have occurred regardless of the type of government in power. Indeed, most significant economic changes occur in spite of, not because of any particular type of government.

A well fed and intoxicated society is probably easier to steer away from revolution; I'm not sure that this was FDR's specific plan. But this is not necessarily a perfect cure all for political revolt. People can feel angry and disenfranchised for any number of reasons. If the current class of super wealthy and legally privileged people grow in power, and in particular, if they are being perceived to be abusing that power, then a relatively comfortable bottom 50% of the population may find the motivation to revolt if they feel that the democratic system will be unable to protect their way of life.",1475280069

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I did something similar.  I was seeing someone at the time, although she was out of town (or we might have been ""on a break"") and I was having a boys night.  I popped out for a cigarette and I noticed these two girls talking out of the corner of my eye.  Now, to be fair, they were gorgeous; nothing over the top, not like they were all gussied up or about to be in a music video, just naturally very attractive.  Then I saw a couple of guys giggling like idiots and noticed they were taking pictures of them.  I thought it was kind of creepy so I just walked up to them like I was supposed to meet them there and started chatting them up, and after I minute I leaned in and said something to the effect of ""I assure you I'm quite shy, but those guys standing behind you were taking your picture and I thought they might stop if I came up and started talking to you.""  They looked at each other and then behind them and the guys were there trying to act nonchalant but it was obvious they were up to something.  One of the girls flashed a smile, put her hand on my forearm and said ""We owe you a drink.""  I blushed and stammered ""I...I have a girlfriend, actully, but have a good night"" and walked away.

Kainui and Seagull started walking toward the backdoor, Kainui not really sure where it would lead but it seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Captain Gill urged the duo to stop, but nothing was going to stop their fight.

""What if you just postpone it? I mean you both are still in bad condition!""

""Kainui feel better already. Kainui ready if you are.""

""I've been ready since I looked at your pitiful mug."" Seagull smirked, ""We're going to have some fun.""

""Kainui agree, but Kainui going to enjoy it so much more.""

Then suddenly, Kainui heard a familiar voice call out to him.

""That-That's the guy who did this to Terry! Wait he's a marine?""

Kainui and Seagull were already out the door, Kainui was glad Seagull didn't hear that or else the fight might not be such a friendly fight after all. Kainui wouldn't be able to fend off that many marines safely.",1475280070

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","&gt;Galactic News: Curious Transmission Partially Decoded

&gt;01 OCT 3302

&gt;In early August, an antique Cobra Mk III was interred at the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard. Shortly before the ship was laid to rest, a beacon aboard the vessel transmitted a repeating sequence of curious characters.

&gt;The sequence was picked up by several listening and relay posts in the Tionisla system, and it has now been determined that it contains content obscured with an unknown encryption. The encrypted data is followed by an apparently meaningless clear-text phrase: **'The vain queen rides a giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero.'**

&gt;Intelligence services within the Alliance, Empire and Federation are said to be investigating the message, but no official statements have yet been made. Both the sender and intended recipient of the message remain a mystery.

While I've never been a fan of the Chinese Communist Party or their methods, I always had sympathy for the masses, thinking that they could hardly be blamed for embracing socialism and rising up against their exploitative landlords.

So I was pretty surprised to learn that the landlord barely existed in China, as the pages I've copied show. If anyone wants to see the footnotes I'm happy to provide them.

Now I finally understand why writers like Mo Yan, who I'd always seen as pretty critical of previous government policies, have been tolerated by the party - their criticisms actually mask a deeper propaganda message and the foundation myth of the CCP, one with no basis in fact or reality.

It's the same kind of propaganda used by outlets such as Sixth Tone, which focus on a small negative in order to trick you into unconsciously accepting the real message they have woven into the narrative.",1475280075

"videos","t5_2qh1e","CO2 has diminishing returns as far as heat retention. If 50 ppm increased temp by 1, you would need 150 ppm to increase to 2, and 300 ppm for 3. And the temp increase is not yearly. 50 ppm would, after 1 year or 5 years, only increase the temp by 1 degree. If what you were saying is true, it would be 150 degrees at least outside right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Are we really dramatically altering our climate? The true answer is: the evidence is inconclusive so far. Despite the claims and computer created models, none of it had been accurate.

&amp;nbsp;

CO2 levels were over 3000 ppm during an ice age. Why was the temp not ridiculously high? Why was the ice still forming?

&amp;nbsp;

I love the skepticalscience.com website. Not because they post accurate information, but because people challenge the biased charts and statements they make. Much more is learned by understanding the information than by blindly believing and then regurgitating misinformation.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not denying climate change is a possibility. I am not even denying humans have an impact. I am however, challenging the extent of our impact.

It blows my mind that he thinks playing Copeland, Smith, Hicks 10 yards from the LOS is a good idea when our DL is so thin. 

Most of our struggles are on coaching (and player development to a degree - our safeties should not be this bad for so many years in a row). We have the talent to be really good, and our head man is a genius, but Dantonio has surrounded himself with a lot of average or worse assistants.",1475280079

In particular, go through the following steps (tabs) of the tool:

1. Read the instructions to ensure your system is in a proper state
2. Run the Pre-Scan to find any up-front problems
3. Do the disk Check, and if errors are found choose the ""Open Check Disk at Next Boot"" option and restart the computer
4. Click the ""Do It"" button to run the system file checker
5. Optionally create a registry and/or System Restore point

After those steps click the Repairs tab, follow the instructions, then click the ""Open Repairs"" button. You can pick whatever, if anything, you want to do from the list. It is a large list, and I'm not completely sure what the consequences of running all the different things are, but the option is out there. Your choice to do any of these things, then click ""Start Repairs"". 

You could just stop after step 4 as the couple of things it does up to that point are good to try out. Step 4 including running a Windows image repair to try and fix major issues with your system files. Let me know if this helps at all.",1475280079

In Java, you used Swing which was more MVC friendly, but Swing and WinForms are very different.  WinForms is modeled more on the older (pre-.net) Visual Basic forms.  It doesn't play well with MVC.

A more common pattern in use with WinForms is called MVP or Model View Presenter.  It's similar to MVC, but has some key differences that make it work a little better.

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649571.aspx

If you were to move to WPF instead of WinForms, then the common pattern there is called MVVM or Model-View-ViewModel and is more oriented towards the declarative model of WPF.

There are numerous examples of trying to implement MVC with WinForms (you can google them if you like), but you will probably run into more issues than it solves.",1475280081

Everything since release has been about keeping as much of that $180+ million they made on sales. That is probably why they are silent now (so they won't get sued).  

They have the money now to provide good support to players (even if they are quiet) but they are not doing that. Tickets remain unanswered after 4 weeks. 

It remains to be seen if they will spend the money to improve the game, but I doubt it. Sean personally gained $10 million from this debacle.

I highly recommand you to use a fast weapon offhand or your slow weapon off hand and a fast one mainhand. This way you get some mix up and you always have the oportunity to twohand one of these.

I made verry good expierience with such weapon combos. Here a tiny list of some combos I did or I met and were working verry well:

------Lefthand --------Right hand

- Fume ultragreatsword - Longsword
- Dragonslayer greataxe - dragonslayer spear
- Yohrms Machety - Butcher knife
- Astora greatsword - Onikiri &amp; Ubadatchi (Washing pole is also verry well)
- dragonslayer axe (the small one) - Dragonslayer Swordspear
- Rapier - Black knight great axe

If you want an offhand fast weapon, the ""most OP one"" is the Rapier. It is quiet fast, has okay range, can rollcatch and has a verry nice Parry with quiet some frames.

If you want to use the heavy one offhand and need a fast one mainhand, I'd say Washing pole, or a good straightsword are the best options. (straightswords have insane rollcatch With R1&gt;R1&gt;R2 combo and washing pole has a great running attack, generaly verry good range &amp; dmg. Also quiet good options are Gargoyle flamespear, Dragonslayer spear oe the redhilted halberd. But be carefull, some of these weapons don't have 360¬∞ autoo aim (thus, not optimal roolcatch if enemies roll behind you).",1475280083

"ethtrader","t5_37jgj","The Synereo team holds so much of the AMP market, it feels like a disgrace.  They even recently burnt 700,000,000 AMP tokens in an attempt to make the situation look ""honest"", but all they did was reduce their overall holdings from 96% to 93%.  

Current situation according to Synereo itself:

62981963 (APMs in market now) / 949291063 (Total AMPs after token burn) = 6.63% (percent of AMPs in the open market).  So that means they hold 93% for themselves and for their own control.  

They may be writing some good software, but there is really no ethical reason for them to have that high of a percentage of the platform and then go around having crowdfunding sales at their whim which destroys the free market fundamentals in the free market for their poor early adopters who are just abused by it. It seems very manipulative and unethical and they play word games and continuously rationalize the situation without ever really addressing any of the concerns.  So I'm confused by Synereo because the project seems cool but they have lost my trust.

They are nowhere near as honest and transparent and relinquishing-control-to-the-free-markets as the Ethereum Foudation has been.  Ethereum is the example to follow, not Synereo.

My office also just got a couple cubii under desk ellipticals so I tried one of those. It is quiet but not silent, which I found a little distracting. It's also a smaller motion than the pedals I already had so I feel like I'm getting less of a workout (for as much this could be considered a workout). On the flip side, since the motion is smaller and easier to do, it's easier to do it for longer periods of time. The cubii also tracks your activity and syncs it with your Fitbit so the data nerd in me loved seeing the distance and calories burned.

I'm not actively trying to lose weight so I can't comment on how effective these would be for that, but any activity at your desk is better than none. I'd start with a cheap model and see how you like it!

But then another part of me feels like he's confused as fuck and so hurt by her, but still hopes to have a mother that truly loves him.

*These aren't mutually exclusive.*  Both are likely true.  

You have tough choices.  You could be facing the end of this marriage; that frightens you for good reason.  I think you need to tell your husband your perceptions and feelings as clearly and plainly as you have here.  He's set the tone in the relations with his family by allowing his children (all four) to be treated unequally and abused.  You love him and care about him - and you can't allow this to continue.  

An adult does what needs to be done - shakey, scared, sick to their stomach, hating it, wanting to run away.  We do it anyhow; it's part of what defines us.  Courage is doing the hard stuff while nauseous with panic.  

This applies, I believe, to both you and FH.  He's failing to act like an adult; you rightfully don't like shouldering the burden by yourself.  *The end result is your children suffer.*  

You can't change him - You control only yourself.  A defining moment in our lives is when we choose to do the right thing - or not - when mates / spouses don't.  

I think it's OK, even good, to tell him you love him &amp; want to spend the rest of your lives together but that you'll not subject any of your children to this your FMIL/SIL's meanness.  No matter what.  For your FH, the old saw applies, ""Lead, follow or get out of the way.""  From your description he's been doing none of the three.  Tell him you want him to stand beside you - ideally he should lead; it's his family - but firmly following would work.  

If he can do neither, he needs to step aside or get run over because you'll do what's right by children - small persons who lack the ability to protect themselves come before FMIL, FSIL's or FH, who are chronological adults. 

I commiserate with you.  This IS difficult.  It's a circumstance no one SHOULD face, but you do.  My best to you.

"MrRobot","t5_37dnc","&gt;The main plot barely moved forward, and instead we get lots of subplots that are just filling the time. Elliot's prison time, Angela's role within E-Corp, the aftermath of fsociety, the power play between Price and Whiterose, Joanna's story,... all of these stories are meandering, with little payoff. It's only in the last two episodes that everyone is back on track, and we get some idea of what role they're going to play next. 

The main plot move quite a bit though. In particular from what you mentioned: We see how 5/9 is fucking up life for everyone, how ECorp plans to survive the hack as well as obstacles from the US Government, and how fsociety is trying to gain momentum from pulling off one of the biggest hacks in world history, the FBI investigation. I'm not exactly sure what you mean when you say the plot barely moved forward considering what's been happening in the season.

&gt;The season focussed too much on Elliot's mental state and too little on the hacking. The balance was especially off in the first half of the season, which moved at a snail's pace. 

Because that was the point of the season. Elliot was stuck in prison from since the end of zero day, so the writers are limited in how much hacking they could have their protagonist do, especially in prison, where electronics aren't easily accessible. In spite of these limitations, they did show a bit with Elliot writing the code for the femtocell plan, and reading migration code with Ray's Silk Road-esque site. Moreover, with Elliot realizing that he's slowly losing control of Mr. Robot, he's going to do everything in his power to try and regain control. In that regard, the hacking is always going to be secondary to his mental health as Elliot perceived that going to a terminal would only aggravate the Mr. Robot intervening issue. That's one way that he had leverage over him.

&gt;The unreliable narrator trope is getting annoying. The reveal of Elliot being in jail was well done, but enough is enough. If I constantly have to wonder if what I'm seeing is real or not, I become less invested in the actual story.

While the show does use an unreliable narrator, I don't think it tries hard to fool the audience. Take S1 for instance, the fight club reveal and premise could be seen as early as episode 1 (Romero looking at Elliot and ignoring Mr. Robot). And then you have the first half of S2 using a surrealistic setting before Elliot reveals that he's in prison. Furthermore, I'd argue that it sets an interesting relationship between Elliot and the audience. We are forced to see only what he sees, so when he deliberately withholds information because he doesn't trust us, it creates a more unnerving experience of trying to piece things together. Though, I agree that not everyone is going to like this method, heck, I even hate some of the books with unreliable narrators.

On the flip side, like I mention in the later points, the show does enough to give its audience clues about how they should perceive a certain plot point. For instance, people assumed Tyrell was a split and consistently disregarded that Robot was in static whereas Tyrell wasn't, and that he spoke to Angela.

&gt;The last episode was good, but a very unsatisfying way to end the season. The absence of Tyrell, who I consider the most fascinating character, really hurt the season, and his return was too little too late. The finale also trod a little too close to Fight Club for my taste. 

The absence of Tyrell makes sense in the context of the show. He couldn't be too visible or else he'd risk being taken in for questioning and arrested. Moreover, Elliot was sidelined in prison. There was no secure way of contacting him (it's why Robot gives him shit and only gives him a minute or so). Also, I'd argue that his absence was intentional in that Esmail wanted the audience to be as clueless as Elliot after his 3-day memory loss. It's why so many people assumed he was a personality split in the penultimate gunshot scene, when all it did was solidify Tyrell as existing.

If that was too close to Fight Club, then how did you feel about the reveal that Elliot is Mr. Robot? 

&gt;In my opinion, they could've condensed all 12 episodes into 7 or 8, which would've left enough time to actually complete Stage 2. 

Not necessarily true. Tyrell Wellick mentioned in the finale that they're waiting a month for ECorp to centralize all their paper records into the one location that Elliot and Mr. Robot saw (in addition, he mentioned that they originally had 71 locations and implied that they were considering bombing all of them). And judging by Tyrell's computer, he did not finish writing the malware for the UPS firmware. Either way, you'd have to wait one month in-show time for the hack to be executed. And that's assuming Darlene doesn't crack to the FBI or anything.",1475280086

Primarily a Vegas user - I'm supposed to be getting a license for Premiere at some point but I just found out MAGIX bought Vegas from Sony.  They just released Vegas 14, and Sony is now onto something called Catalyst which I have not tried.  On Vegas 13, it is vastly bound by the CPU even with CUDA rendering enabled properly.  
  
The 25% difference you mention is over twice the increase I've been seeing on the web.  If you are lucky, you might see a 10% increase on some tests, and other tests the 6700k loses to a 3770k in work performance.  
  
I hope Zen gives them a kick in the butt to at least get incentivized to looking in the general direction of work performance.  Yes, yes, the technical marvels of shrinking with less power is mind-blowing, but like I said, I do not get affected in a noticeable way.  I save a few cents per year when paying the power company?  uh, woo and yay and stuff..?

See if you can isolate it to a specific point of failure and go from there. Bringing in support services or your cable company before that risks a lot of unproductive effort.  

Doing this I've been able to fix major connection issue with my nearby friends twice. In one instance, dude had bought a top of the line router that ended up being the source of all his problems. It worked perfectly fine with every game EXCEPT destiny for some reason.

Barclays Center does tons of events, I am sure they told ESL that they would not have the stage ready until Saturday and ESL said okay. This wasn't some surprise to ESL, they knew this would happen. TONS of other events go on without these problems. Do you not agree that it is ESL's responsibility to book their events well? A stage takes a long time to build, the people who are actually working in the area are doing a fine job I'm sure. It's ESL's booking that is causing this problem, so why is it not their responsibility?

Also, if ESL decided to not stream the group stages, they would quickly find their events becoming less popular. With MLG and ELeague both putting on wonderful events this year, every ESL failure is putting them behind.

A 10,000 person drop off is pretty huge. But if you look at who we played at home those years it makes sense. 

In 2014 we had 1 OOC (Memphis), Utah, Oregon, Arizona, plus Stanford and USC which always draws a crowd. All these teams finished ranked except for Stanford.

Last year for 2015 we had 2 OOC (Virginia &amp; BYU), ASU, Cal, Colorado, and WSU. None of these teams finished ranked.

We have a crosswalk that goes between our two office buildings. It has a stop sign and everything. Cars always stop. Sure, sometimes the drivers are a little frustrated that they had to stop while a bunch of people cross, but they stop anyways. 

Bikers though? They just blow through. We had one guy actually nearly hit someone who was crossing, and he had the audacity to get off his bike and explain that because he was on a bike, *he* had the right of way and didn't have to stop... AT A STOP SIGN THAT HAS BRIGHT RED FLASHING LIGHTS AROUND IT.

Seriously. I've grown to hate bikers. They don't stop when they're supposed to, they're unpredictable, and they think they don't have to obey the traffic laws ""because they have more to lose than someone driving a car"". 

How hard is it to:

- Stop at stop signs instead of blowing through them.
- Travel in the right direction on the street (I see bikers going the wrong way *even when there are arrows pointing the other way with little bikes under them*).
- Don't ride on sidewalks (cars aren't expecting you, pedestrians aren't expecting you, and it's illegal).

Seriously how hard is this? I rode a bike around town from the time I was 10 years old until I moved out of my parents' house. I followed all of the laws, stopped at stop signs, looked both ways... I could do this at 10, why can't adult cyclists seem to do these things?",1475280095

The most dangerous thing I did was pet a bee (which is pretty incredible as I'm usually terrified of bees). 

My point is, yes MDMA is a powerful and thrilling experience, but the only dangers it could possibly bring are if the user is completely inexperienced, the user is an asshole anyways, or the user mixes it with other drugs.

People don't realize this - yeah, credit unions are there to give you a small town banking feel with the assurance that there's not a whole board of directors and executives in which at least 1/10th aren't shady as shit working behind. However, you can't lie, big banks are convenient as fuck for a global economy. As well as the fact that credit unions charge a shit ton for essentially everything you do except for some credit. 

Withdrawal of cash? -$5 at least, every time.

It sucks that we have to have execs in banking who are total scum - but I'll never bank at a credit union again because it's so god damn inconvenient. I'd rather be asked about something and give a no back than have to actually forfeit money everytime I wanted to do something.

"freefolk","t5_37tpy","I guess it would be better to say that they aren't wealthy. But a lot of these things you're talking about depend on successful large harvests, and a large population. There is a lot of land yes, but Alaska is huge and not an overly wealthy or populated state for the same reasons. The land is most likely not well suited to large scale farming as it is in the south. If it is full of hills, mountains, and forests as the maps and descriptions of it suggest. The north gets snow even in the summer also, that can be devastating to a lot of cash crops. Consider North America during the civil war even. The north had weath from industry, not farming. The land just wasn't as well suited for farming as it was in the south. In Westeros it doesn't seem like there are any economies centered around industry, and from what descriptions we are given the north isn't full of craftsmen and the like. So let's say they still have massive amounts of forests, and the accompanying streams, lakes, mountains etc. with abundant game. That's all well and good, but a society strictly of hunters and woods people isn't going to be very economically thriving. 

There is the possible lumber industry, but again it isn't ever mentioned and the wood isn't described as rare or anything as woods from the summer islands and other far off places. Also moving tons of lumber so far wasn't as easy logistically as it is in modern times. In addition, the only port of note is Whitegaurd. They don't seem overly concerned with shipping/exporting much of anything. It seems most of the lumber is sourced locally for shipbuilding and the like, at least when people need lumber. When Daenerys(sp?) is besieging a city the defenders burn every tree within 20 leagues or something to prevent her from building siege weapons. If they could buy lumber that would be great, but the defenders didn't seem concerned about that. Also, when the iron islands is talking about building their super fleet they say something about cutting down every tree on the islands if I remember correctly. They could just as easily steal as much as they'd like off the west coast of the north, with it being in disarray. 

I'm not arguing about the Starks actually being middle class, of course they are nobility. They represent this sort of middle class in a way I guess, but I'm not pushing that one way or another. I just don't agree with the authors points of how they could be so well off, when a lot of their points towards the Starks being wealthy don't make much sense.

One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fires were burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
And he said, ""Boys, I'm not turning;


I'm headed for a land that's far away
Beside the crystal fountains
So come with me, we'll go and see
The Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night.


Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.


In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs


The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.


In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks


The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey too
You can paddle all around them
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.


In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin.
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in.


There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains ...


I'll see you all this coming fall
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.",1475280098

Abraham Lincoln

Also, this is conjecture, but maybe it was Ford staging the coup, or perhaps one of the german industrialists funding the nazi regime from the usa?

The ground combat was the original core mechanics Cryptic had for an original IP set in a Greco-Roman fantasy world. (Which looked pretty awesome to me IMO, was on a wait list to pre-order.) But then they dropped it when they got the option to make Star Trek instead. It turns out that the Ground Combat was the weakest part at launch, the original game probably wouldn't have survived.

As a whole was very weak for the first year or 2. The original missions were already something you had to find on your own by the time I joined after the F2P relaunch, they weren't part of the directed storyline at all by then and they and many other parts of the original game were removed entirely on either the 4th or 5th anniversary update. Without the draw of the license, it never would have lasted long enough for the various reworks and add-ons to come and make the game what it is today.",1475280101

Looking in the mirror, I saw the hints of doubt in my face - worrying about what could go wrong. My mind raced through the situations that could transpire tonight. Then, back to our last meeting a week ago. We had taken a picture. And in that picture was the two of us embracing each other with the largest grins. To me, to us, the rest of the world didn't exist, it was completely irrelevant in comparison to each other. It was the best time of my life.

"climate","t5_2qhx3","I think it's quite funny that it's probably the people here who bitch about climate deniers bending the truth or over sensationalising reports that have down voted me. 

I do think that passing the 400 ppm mark is a tragedy and it most likely is going to take hundreds of years till we get back below that figure again. The full effects of that compounded with the fact we are still pumping even more carbon into the atmosphere every year probably won't be felt for decades to come, much sooner possibly.

But to say it will stay at this level for good is most unlikely. It's an artificially high level we are sustaining by pumping tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Which we will stop one day, sometime in the future. We will almost certainly work out a way to scrub this from the atmosphere, if nature don't do it for us with massive algae blooms or something. It will fall back below this level. 

My point was mainly it would be more truthful to say 'in our lifetimes' or 'for generations to come'. By bending the truth to make it more link baity don't really do anyone any good except the climate deniers who can make the same point to back up their case of saying climate science over dramatises the evidence and lies. 

It's certainly a wake up call, as if we needed one but it most certainly is not forever.  ",1475280107

"Philippines","t5_2qjov","Yes, rail systems are a factor in industrialising the country. Here are some of the advantages:

1. Dependable: The greatest advantage of the railway transport is that it is the most dependable mode of transport as it is the least affected by weather conditions such as rains, fog etc. compared to other modes of transport.

2. Better Organised:The rail transport is better organised than any other form of transport. It has fixed routes and schedules. Its service is more certain, uniform and regular as compared to other modes of transport.
 
3. High Speed over Long Distances: Its speed over long distances is more than any other mode of transport, except airways. Thus, it is the best choice for long distance traffic.

4. Suitable for Bulky and Heavy Goods: Railway transport is economical, quicker and best suited for carrying heavy and bulky goods over long distances.

5. Cheaper Transport: It is a cheaper mode of transport as compared to other modes of transport. Most of the working expenses of railways are in the nature of fixed costs. Every increase in the railway traffic is followed by a decrease in the average cost. Rail transport is economical in the use of labour also as one driver and one guard are sufficient to carry much more load than the motor transport.

6. Safety: Railway is the safest form of transport. The chances of accidents and breakdowns of railways are minimum as compared to other modes of transport. Moreover, the traffic can be protected from the exposure to sun, rains, snow etc.

7. Larger Capacity: The carrying capacity of the railways is extremely large. Moreover, its capacity is elastic which can easily be increased by adding more wagons.

8. Public Welfare: It is the largest public undertaking in the country. Railways perform many public utility services. Their charges are based on ‚Äòcharge what the traffic can bear‚Äô principle which helps the poor. In fact, it is national necessity.

9. Administrative Facilities of Government: Railways provide administrative facilities to the Government. The defence forces and the public servants drive their mobility primarily from the railways.

10. Employment Opportunities: The railways provide greater employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled labour. ",1475280109

&gt; The European Space Agency which led the mission consortium, including NASA, decided that setting down the orbiter on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was the best way to close the project.

&gt; The Rosetta orbiter returned spectacular images when the comet made its closest approach to our star and tails of material were driven off.

&gt; When Rosetta first arrived at 67P in August 2014 project scientist Matt Taylor told CNN that by following the comet on its journey they could see how it changed from its inert phase to when it was highly active as it approached the sun.

A proper home surround system will sound miles ahead of the movie theaters. I haven't heard a single theater yet which sounds as immersive and clean as my home setup.

Also, if you're spending 1/3 the price of your center channel speaker on your subwoofer then you will have a completely garbage subwoofer. Subwoofers are much more elaborate speakers than a center channel so they are going to have to cost much more.",1475280110
"AmericanHorrorStory","t5_2spug","Thredson's reveal was not seen coming by me, nor any one else I knew who watched Asylum live. However, it was a reveal that made almost everyone want to smack themselves silly for not seeing a lot sooner. On various re-watches of Asylum, it's largely hinted early on by AHS that Thredson not what he seems, but Murphy plays on our complete hatred of Sister Jude early on before we see everything in a much wider lens and broader context. Once this is all cleared up, the season is able to conclude on the awesome path it's set up so brilliantly.

[Unrelated to your post, but very related to the subreddit &amp; inspired by your post:]
   
I think that we are forgetting what it's like to watch seasons, early on, week by week, when we are trying to come up with ways the season will reveal itself. So many theories are too obsessed with that bullshit Twitter account, or just trying to force jam references to each season into the most uninteresting ways possible. I think the reason I enjoyed Asylum as much as I did, other than it's content and production/direction/writing etc., is that I hadn't been trying to see my favorite previous parts of the series in the season I was watching. I was just enjoying it for what it was - interesting. Roanoke *is interesting otherwise all of us wouldn't be here*, so maybe we're setting ourselves up for failure with all this crazy conjecture.

At the end of MoP I had 19 level capped (90) toons. Last expac I ended with 'only' 11, mainly due to not subbing most WoD. For overall toons level 90 or higher, I have 27 at current count, on five Servers; Wyrmrest Accord, Bloodhoof, Tanaris/Greymane (they're connected servers) and Hyjal. 

Most of these toons are the byproduct of Recruit A Friend. Literally every November during the Black Friday Sale, me and two of my friends buy a $5 copy and WoW and RaF power level with each other over Xmas break. It's kind of our ""tradition,"" of sorts, as we've done this five years running. We tend to gravitate towards a new server each time, and more and more we make attempts to level as fast as possible through dungeons with whatever potions/BoAs we can.

Other than that, two of the 27 are from the WoD/Legion boosts, WoD's was a Mage, and this time around it's my freshly 110 leveled Warlock.

As for 100-110, I've been loving the class stories. Half through leveling my DH, and she'll be #4 at 110. Then I'll be leveling my DK, and then a Shaman.

My main, as such, revolves. I was a Druid in Wrath, a Warlock from Cata to the end of Highmaul (WoD) progression, then Druid again for the rest of WoD. Currently calling my main my Monk, but Warlock keeps calling me more and more, and though I try to resist....

I'll ask her if I was doing anything unusual.  Yup I'm in the US.  The shitty insurance I have right now *is* an Obamacare thing, or at least I got it through some process of applying for medicaid then getting rejected but also using this online marketplace where I entered a bunch of info about my income then got like half off on the insurance even though I wasn't eligible for medicaid.  

My income varies quite a bit as I work for myself.  Fired a client who was just being shifty overall (some with me, much more with many other stakeholders - guy seemed incapable of honestly assessing anything), thinking that my other two would support me, but then one of the other ones has taken to canceling about half our meetings which means less income.  It's been a rough couple of months with me standing hat in hand at the landlord's office.  

My beard turned grey this last month.  

Just unloading a bit.  Even without any specific diagnosis it doesn't surprise me my brain had a glitch.  This has been one of the most stressful brief periods of my life.  I've started tracking daily meditation and I'm gonna do 100 days straight.  About a week into that and it's helping me feel hopeful and stable.  

Also I've had this weird shoulder injury and I have no idea how it happened I just went to scratch my back one day and found I couldn't reach up without pain.  Like someone had wrenched my arm into a submission hold and had taken it too far, but I don't remember having any kind of impact or anything on the shoulder.  

Fell off my bike like a month ago and landed decently well by slapping both hands down hard aikido style so I didn't get any real injuries, except now three or four weeks later the palms of my hands are still sore as it if happened yesterday.  All this weird shit going on where my body doesn't seem to heal or recover properly.

Less then a month ago, in OWO qualifiers, a 2-2-2 comp was used with Rein-Zarya-Lucio-Zen and 2 DPS, usually Genji and McCree. 

After that the NiP comp with 3 tanks and 3 healers used nanoboosted Rein to achieve victory. 

This was expected to be used at OW (especially on the EU bracket) but now we see nanoboosted Reaper and lots of Tracer and Mei but also Genji, Hanzo, Winston, McCree and Roadhog.

To a large extent we are back to the comps of a month ago, except Ana has replaced Zen, but the meta is changed because the nanoboost has become crucial. 

With the slower charging nanoboost already on PTR we may see other changes in meta very soon.

Mob Psycho was amazing as well, and LL! Sunshine ended up leagues better than the first seasons.

**Worst Anime: Battery** (Dropped episode 1) - Boring and melodramatic. I tried to watch through the second episode as well, but couldn't get myself to finish it.

**Best Surprise Anime: Mob Psycho 100** (9/10), **HM: Love Live Sunshine** (8/10) - I knew Mob Psycho would be good going in, but I ended up liking it far more than I initially expected. Sunshine, too, surpassed my expectations by being better than the first two seasons in just about every aspect.

**Most Disappointing Anime: Battery** (Dropped episode 1), **DM: Orange** (6/10) - I had my hopes up for Battery, hoping for a sports show that would be more similar to Ping Pong. Needless to say, I was pretty damn let down. I actually ended up enjoying Orange; the beginning and ending were great, but the problems that arose in the middle from poor production values really dragged it down a lot.

Phones are dirt cheap to make, when I was a sales manager for Best Buy, we could literally sell a phone for $0.01 and still make almost $300 including the cost of the phone due to the kick back and margin we had on it.

A shield would repel too fast a blow, admit only the slowly deceptive counter. It needed control and trickery to get through a shield.

As an Australian, I had no problem using my credit card to pay. It said my order could not be processed at first, but I simply retyped my billing information again and it went through. Not entirely sure if this works just for Australians but figured I'd post this for those of us down here who have to pay a whopping $79 AUD (physical game) for a game set in our own country. This deal makes it just over $26 AUD, saving $53 or a couple of Halal Snack packs.

If you don't know what a Halal Snack Pack is, get on it. Guaranteed to win you brownie points with any Aussie instead of typically misguided stereotype such as putting a 'shrimp on a barbie'.

For everyone:

Also heads up, make sure to separately add the VIP pass to your cart for a total of $30 USD, saving a further $10 USD. The VIP pass is initially 19.99.

One superficial advantage of this is that you can now mount a power button anywhere and connect it with 2 little wires rather than having to have it built into the power supply or running 110V wall current through the case to a switch.

Other advantages are that it allows for ""sleep mode"" where the computer is only *partially* turned off allowing you to turn on the machine very quickly by pressing a button on your keyboard.

It also allows for things like [Wake on LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN) which allows machines to be sent ""turn on"" signals over their network cards.  For this to work, the ethernet card has to be drawing a bit of power to watch for signals.",1475280119

And they just make plea bargaining more coercive. An innocent defendant might take a mandatory minimum plea deal knowing that if they take it to trial and lose they can't get anything better from the Court and will probably get worse. It makes the risk/reward calculus even further in the State's favor. (Edit: And if you make the mandatory minimums too high, you get the opposite effect. If the minimum is 25, what does a guilty SoB have to lose by going to trial. You never know, a key witness might have a heart attack.)

"Eve","t5_2qil9","&gt; Identify the type of cosmic signature at a lower percentage

So I'll be able to identify every gas site in the hole with a 16AU scan?

Might be better to reduce cluster size: set max spawn distance to 2AU rather than 4AU and you get the same effect.

&gt;if you have no interest in Data and Relics ( the hardest sigs to scan) then don't waste time scanning them to the level of identification

Moving this up to ask: is the intent of this to identify faction vs sleeper relic/data sites earlier, or just to identify G/D/R/W?

&gt; Scanning should be more rewarding. 

I'm unclear on how any of the things in this work out as being more or less rewarding: is scanning through wormholes any different to roaming through nullsec? Sometimes Bob smiles, sometimes he doesn't. Unless there's a proposal to make holes connect to active holes more than empty holes... but that could be problematic for other reasons...?

End of the day, if you're looking for content that primarily comes from finding other people which I'm unsure if changing scanning will really achieve.

&gt;Give c4's an outgoing c4&gt;NS NS&gt;c4 with 2bil mass.

Why can't they just make those NS&gt;C5 holes reappear properly as they used to? C4 holes are supposed to be ""deep wormhole"" space without k-space links right? Those kspace&gt;c4 frig holes are bad enough.

&gt;Give c6's dual statics

Isn't there a risk here that the large high-class groups will then dominate low-class space? At the minute, the tendency for them to live in C6&gt;C6 (or c5&gt;c5) holes seems to provide an obvious barrier to them slamdunking the low-class, much smaller groups. If you could have a C6&gt;C4/C6 then suddenly you've got this issue where your C4 groups have a much higher incidence of encountering a group that is null content for them: even negative content as they can't even roll against that size group.

&gt;Give another stage of EOL maybe 15-30mins ""imminent collapse"".

This is awesome, yes please

&gt;You earn more money running c1s vs c2s and you earn more in c3s than c4s.

You can earn more running relic/data sites in C1-3 than you do running C3/C4 sites (though a friend flies a Marauder and reckons he's earning about 150m/h/pilot in c4s, which would be more than my 120m/h/pilot avg for relic/data sites). Wormhole Sleeper sites need a serious buff in low-class space. They're just compeltely non-competivive atm.

I'm making 2-4b/week just by running sites casually whilst I scan out holes. It's a little crazy.

&gt;Bugs

FPS drops in Shattered wormholes, gas sites, etc.

&gt;Tether will follow you around the wormhole.

I jumped through a wormhole and tethered to an enemy citadel 22AU away the other day. Fleetmates couldn't lock me till I broke tether by locking one of them... Definitely something zany going on with wormholes and tethering.",1475280121

Also CTR gaslighting on Reddit saying subreddits like r/politics are biased for Trump is pretty crazy too.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting

Edit: Obama is currently trying to push through legislation to hand over control of the Internet to the UN. Usually something like this would be on top of r/news and r/politics but CTR stops those articles at 0 points. They only gain traction in r/the_donald . Reddit was able to bring enough attention to bills like CISPA and PIPA to stop them before but because of CTR we might not be able to bring enough attention to this new one.

&gt; Although it‚Äôs hard to know exactly what convinced [Sarah Koenig] that this story would be worth her time, and that there was a potential injustice here, her talk with Chris may have been what cinched it. They met at a restaurant shortly after her initial meeting with Saad and me, and she got right down to business. 

&gt; She asked Chris what the deal was, was this guy really innocent, because she wasn‚Äôt about to waste time on the case otherwise. 

&gt; Chris reassured her that yes, this was a case that needed to be investigated and that he personally always felt Adnan was innocent. In fact, a few years prior Chris had sent Adnan a letter, his first communication with him since he had stopped representing him in 1999. For all these years [Chris] hadn‚Äôt stopped thinking about Adnan. He knew that the wrong person had been convicted of this crime. The letter he sent explained a **new brain-mapping technology that could determine if a person‚Äôs mind had certain memories that could only be stored if they had indeed experienced an event. So if Adnan had nothing to do with Hae‚Äôs murder, this technology could prove his brain had no such memories stored.**

&gt; Adnan had sent me the letter, and after doing some research I learned that the technology was so new, it wasn‚Äôt yet recognized by any jurisdiction as evidence. Plus, there was no way Justin [Brown] would be interested in pursuing something that would distract from his PCR petition, especially something untested. 

&gt; Adnan had written Chris back to thank him, but we never pursued his suggestion. Still, Adnan was deeply grateful that [Chris] still remembered him and made the effort to reach out to his old client.

According to The Dick Show Episode 18, this is because Dick went home with Maddox's Ex-Girlfriend after a wedding. It should be noted that Maddox had a girlfriend who he lived with at this time. Dr. Incognito Secretman diagnosed Maddox of having Chump Syndrome.

Quick Side Note! This is from the episode where they talk about Chump Syndrome and I love it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dick: I teased it. I didn't feel comfortable talking about it, because it's just salacious gossip.

"singing","t5_2rlcx","Is there a particular specific example or explaination your can give on the type of 'ring' you are referring to? Are you referring to the slight ping in certain people's voices that give it a clarity or you talking about the slight 'oomph' in certain people's voices?

  Either way, yeah i think it is a pretty decent sounding voice. You mentioned that your teacher is asking you to open the throat and i would like to know what he/she said to instruct you to open the throat. 

  What i am noticing is that the vowel is tending towards the 'pushed' and spread side possibly from a slight over emphasis on the opening of the throat. Here is the key, you need to both have an open/relaxed throat with a clear sound. A clear sound being a sound with clarity and focus or some would term to as 'ping'. One way you can do it is pretty simple. Simply do 2 sets of scales on the same key. The do-mi-re-fa-mi-so-fa-re-mi-do-re-ti-do(the one you do on the recording). Do it twice. First on a hum/ng sound and then on the second scale open the vowel in either an 'EE' or an 'Ah'. 

  Do either the hum or the 'ng'. Whichever is more comfortable for you. The 'ng' is basically a sustained 'ng' pronunciation as in the word 'sing' or 'ring'. Some also would call this an open hum. Then on the hum/ng, try to find a clear buzzing sensation in the front of your face and at the lips if you are doing a hum. Do not force the sensation, focus on simply humming and the sensation should materialize by itself. Then simply try to keep this same clarity or 'buzz' when you open the mouth into the EE/AH vowel. 

  You may need to record yourself while doing this. Many a times i have notice that people can produce a relatively focused and clean hum/ng. But when they open the mouth to produce a vowel, the tone quality drastically changes into something way less focused and clear. So when you record yourself, see if you can produce the cleanest most 'forward' sound on the hum/ng and see that if you open to the vowel, does the tone quality drastically change. The goal is to keep the tone quality *relatively* consistent. 

  Remember that you are trying to keep the same clarity and focus, different people sound different when the open the hum depending on the physiology of the vocal tract and cords. So it is more important to focus on the forward clarity so as to not make the sound overly nasal or squeezed. Hope this helped!",1475280126

People often got waveform + stats until they could no longer get stats, and only then got Morph and Replicate, and it was actually the most reasonable build..

Morph didn't give stats back then so you couldn't really use it effectively in the early game, Adaptive Strike was super fucking shitty without items (no base damage, lower multiplier, 20s CD, could only either stun or deal damage and Ethereal Blade wasn't in the game yet) and Replicate sucked dick (costed like literally 10 times as much mana and had a bigger cd)",1475280130

That's part of the problem of focusing of who is going to pay rather than what is being paid and/or how the service is being delivered. By continuing to focus on who is going to pay the provider doesn't have the incentives to lower cost or the way they do business. Same for the patients/customers.

 Trying to maintain insurance or pay the penalty is going to put many under more financial stress than a medical event. Financial ruin and stress are still there under Obama Care. I'll take my chances without the ACA  because I know what will happen if I try to fund it through taxes, fines and/or premiums- there's no chances, just certainties.

That means if every company offered a 5% rate of return pension, there might be many that succeeded, but some will fail. Since we are talking federally regulated programs to ensure people are taken care of in retirement we should have a 100% success rate. Which means we need a backup plan for this backup plan.",1475280133

What I'd do: If you can play EX, use Suyo's calculator to find out how many gems it'll take you to get to 100k points. If it's 30 or less, it's 'worth it' to tier. You should get a total of 33 gems just from dailies/log ins/event rewards, so you're not actually losing ground.

What I'd do is keep 4 of the SRs for now, and feed the third to unlock a skill slot+ get an SR seal. Do that until you can comfortably A or S EX songs, which should be like... 3 events xD After that, then yeah, sell off all five unless you're in love with them.

As for scouting, ^that team farming is actually a slow love gem gain. You'll also get more gems from bonding, so you should still be able to save for scouting, I wouldn't scout immediately when you hit 50, though, I'd wait until you can do at least two pulls at once to increase your chance of idolizing something you pull.

Middle ground path would be to keep ONE idolized SR from an event (like either Dia or Ruby from this event, whichever you like more), and still gain 3 seals. This would get you Maki faster, but there's no real 'best way'.",1475280134

That's observing a behavior then dissecting it afterwards. *One* after *another*. That's why your therapist tells you to *calm down* before reflecting and analyzing, also why they sometimes ask you to try and understand what you did but from a third party's perspective. You could use some of that.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","* I'd recommend the Routeburn over the Kepler.  Negative though is that it's not a loop track.  Part of the Kepler, Milford &amp; Routeburn required crampons &amp; ice axe etc. earlier this year.  Not sure what it's like now.       
* You can get snow and ice down there during October &amp; November.  The bridges on the tracks are removed during the off season, so you'd need to be very skilled at river crossings (and knowing when not to cross) as not only are the rivers icy they flow fast and deep.  If you get swept off your feet you are in serious danger of drowning.  (Drowning wasn't called ""The New Zealand Death"" for nothing).  One plus is that the rivers can go up and down pretty quickly, so if it's high you may only have to wait a few hours or a day for it to subside.      
* The weather is really changeable, esp. in spring when you are looking at going.  It can rain very hard and very quickly then start flooding in some areas.  It can also turn very cold very quickly and you can find yourself fogged out, in snow or sub-zero temperatures.    
* In the off season you can also get avalanches - the Routeburn has a whole swathe of the track (between Lake McKenzie Hut &amp; Routeburn Falls Hut in particular) that is in or near avalanche paths.    You need to have really good back country navigation skills and be resourceful enough to look after yourselves.     
* If you are intending to tramp these tracks, please a) take a beacon, b) tell people where you are going, where you've parked your car and how long you expect to be, c) take appropriate gear and equipment, including more food than you think you'd need, d) visit the DOC offices before you go to check weather and track conditions.  If they tell you not to go then don't go, you don't know better.  I apologise for being blunt, but this is the way it is.  Our backcountry is absolutely fantastic and so gorgeous, but it is also so very brutal and unforgiving.  There are fairly regular stories of visitors getting lost, stuck, hurting themselves or even worse dying.  We want you to have a great time here.      
* There are also some fantastic other tracks that aren't Great Walks, especially on the West Coast of the South Island.  Don't disregard them, even if they are day tramps, as the views can be just as spectacular and they are less busy.  List:    
[Fiordland](http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/)        
[Copland Track](http://www.doc.govt.nz/coplandtrack) - not in times of high rainfall, natural hot pools at the hut.    
[Paparoa National Park](http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/west-coast/places/paparoa-national-park/) - A quick walk is from Blackball in the Valley up over the Paparoas and then down to Barrytown.  Some people do it in a day but it's nice to stay at Ces Clarke Hut (one of the best tops huts in my view) as it has fantastic views into the Grey Valley, to the Tasman Sea and also the Southern Alps (including Mt Cook).  At night you can hear kiwi and other birds.  Some people walk up from Blackball, stay the night, go a little beyond the next day then walk back to Blackball.  The Blackball side is well benched.    
[Heaphy Track](http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/heaphy-track/) - also a Great Walk, less ""glamourous"" than the ones in Fiordland but still equally lovely.

You need to get an Asp, then, if budget is not a concern.

The DBX can't fit two AFMUs (so they can repair each other) unless you drop both shields and the vehicle hangar. Even with one AFMU you still need to choose between shields and the vehicle hangar. Also, with the biggest possible fuel scoop you are looking at 1 min 30 sec to fill up a DBX, compared to 30 sec for the Asp. Jump range and fuel tank capacity are similar so that's a non-issue.

Sure, you *can* just say you don't need shields or two AFMUs for exploration (until you botch a landing on a high G planet), and you can skip the planetary landings altogether, but that means no jumponium and no planetary sightseeing, so I wouldn't call any of that ""embracing exploration properly"".

Even if you want to leave some of those modules out, doing so in an Asp will result in higher jump range than you'd have in the DBX.

Then, after one of the toughest missions in the game, probably series, you're forced to hand over what you just spent a whole mission getting (a case of cocaine, I believe) to her. She reveals that she's a government agent named Karen, breaks up with you, and leaves. Of course, you could argue that since she calls later on, and doesn't arrest Niko right after the mission when she easily could, she's not half bad.

But then she's in GTA V. Seeing her threaten to sodomize a man for information, and acting so goddamn cruel, showed that she'd gotten worse since GTA IV. And, when Michael breaks into the building, she runs away and cries for back-up. Then she disappears.

&gt;[Prohibited contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture is](http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2016-nfl-rulebook/#article-7.-players-in-a-defenseless-posture):

&gt;1. forcibly hitting the defenseless player‚Äôs head or neck area with the helmet, facemask, forearm, or shoulder, **even if the initial contact is lower than the player‚Äôs neck,** and regardless of whether the defensive player also uses his arms to tackle the defenseless player by encircling or grasping him

&gt;Note 2: A player who initiates contact against a defenseless opponent is responsible for avoiding an illegal act. This includes illegal contact that may occur during the process of attempting to dislodge the ball from an opponent. A standard of strict liability applies for any contact against a defenseless opponent, even if the opponent is an airborne player who is returning to the ground or whose body position is otherwise in motion, and **irrespective of any acts by the defenseless opponent, such as ducking his head or curling up his body in anticipation of contact.**

The contact was shoulder-to-shoulder initially but he did end up sliding up and making contact with his head.

If you disagree with the way the rule is written, that's one thing. But as it is written, it was an illegal hit.",1475280147

"wicked_edge","t5_2s46m","It's Straight Razor 101. Even if you carefully dry your blade and keep it oiled while not in use, the edge deteriorates pretty quickly with use. That's why you strop before and/or after every shave. Of course, straight razor users are much pickier about sharpness than some guy who's willing to use a disposable for months, but the concept is the same.

[Here](https://scienceofsharp.wordpress.com/2014/08/13/what-does-stropping-do/) is a blog entry with some electron microscopy showing how stropping re-aligns the edge. The key takeaway point is the first sentence: ""Although a straight razor is made of hardened steel, the edge is flexible and malleable."" The thread linked by the OP claims that ""your stubble, no matter how manly, is not enough to chip or pit steel."" While that may be true as far as it goes, a razor's edge is malleable enough that it can easily be deformed by shaving. And it's also malleable enough that those deformations can be corrected by stropping on something as soft as linen or leather.",1475280147

Rising oceans, to the effect of effectively making a large number of coastal cities uninhabitable without serious geo-engineering. Widespread death of corals and fish species that depend on it. Mass migrations of people and animals including invasive species. Certain spots along the equator could become uninhabitable in the summer. The arctic is likely completely ice free in the summer. A large number of glaciers would be gone. Food crops would begin to yield significantly less without genetic engineering. Heat waves in the summer would make being outside unbearable and potentially deadly. The planet wouldn't respond too kindly to that much extra energy in the atmosphere.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've been studying lately the creation of a new hobby; amateur telebases. A telebase is an outpost in space built and maintained by tele-operated robots, much like the [Stanford OceanOne marine robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1HmgP9l4VY). Though it's common for people today to imagine space activity involving astronauts in spacesuits doing EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity), I see the real future of space development as far more likely to be based on telerobots, with most near-Earth activity performed by people in offices on Earth. It's simply the cheaper approach, driving the costs of access to space down by leveraging the power of automation on the simplification of payloads and the creation of value out there rather than sending it there. That's the real secret to CATS (Cheap Access To Space) we've long overlooked. 

And the great virtue of all this is that it is truly open to public participation in ways never possible before. That's the big broken promise of the Space Age; participation. Most of us cannot be astronauts. Indeed, most people today go through life quite far from what medicine defines as fit and succumb to some form of chronic illness by middle-age. And the society as a whole is aging. That's the norm. Our culture, in the US especially, just doesn't encourage or facilitate a fit society. So if space development is going to be something mainstream society can ever participate in, we can't do everything by EVA. That makes no more sense than relying on olympic athletes to build houses. We need means of working in space anyone can use--even the disabled and relatively old. 

With telerobotics we can access space and do a great deal of work there, cheaply and conveniently even when we can't physically go there. We can make things out there, do practical science and engineering. We can leverage the resources there on making space habitable for regular folks. And what's really great about this technology is that it doesn't need the elaborate facilities of space agencies and giant aerospace corporations to develop. Sure, at some point you need to make spaceworthy hardware and put it in space. But a vast array of design and logistics problems need to be worked on before that--things that don't need rocket science to explore. And that's why I'm exploring this new potential hobby and the idea of a new kind of supranational amateur space program. We can mock-up functional telebases right here on Earth much as we might build model train layouts. We can repurpose the hardware from RC models to build functioning telerobots. We can put these machines online, sharing access and participation across the whole globe. And we can have a lot of fun doing this. This is Minecraft is real life. The creative potential is vast.

But I'm finding this a bit difficult to get to critical mass by myself. People have been so conditioned by SciFi media that it's very hard for them to wrap their heads around this concept. Star Trek defines the common vision of the future more than [Miniatur Wunderland.](http://www.miniatur-wunderland.com/) The notion of using robots as your own proxy out there is, ironically, too alien. And I've found the cost of the construction models that can serve as a starting point for robot development to be more expensive than I had first hoped. But I continue working on this. Maybe someone else will 'get it' eventually.

To your last question - essentially yes. Not only that, but a Spec would provide a high-level description, a low level description with implementation details, and a suggested API to follow. Implementing libraries can fallback to these Specs as documentation. I develop in multiple languages and using the same API in multiple languages would be amazing IMO.

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","I've got a gut feeling (although my gut feelings have been really inaccurate with OPs and EDs tbh) that this really was meant to work when played in reverse. I mean, look at that clock in the end!

EDIT: Just for fun, I played Chase over this, and it works so well I'm a little spooked by it. I was using the full version, but right when the guitar solo kicked in, where it ends in the TV version IIRC, it went to the JJBA logo. Is this really just a coincidence?

EDIT 2: If you start Chase when the clock's arrow is right between the dot to the right of I and I itself, it syncs up even better. My notes:

-The part with Morioh's symbol and other symbols representing characters matches the transition to the vocals beginning perfectly.

-As the lyrics discussing peaceful moments being ripped away and precious things being stolen play, the silhouettes of characters turn black and the city darkens.

-As RHTheMadKing noted, ""If I'm gonna get it back, I have to get it right away."" plays as Hayato fades away.

-This isn't really important, but I think the doors closing sync up with every ""CHASE YOU""!

-The part focusing on Josuke reaching out to Kira with a hand is now matched with Josuke's silhouette turning black and backing towards the clock.

-If you use the TV size version, it ends right where the english version of Araki's name vanishes. If you were to cut out the ""BREAKDOWN""s, it'd make an excellent ending.",1475280159

I'm 20 and my mom is right there so I say no. Big mistake. I woke up when they were taking my tube out in extreme pain, but here's the thing - the pain meds weren't working but the paralytic still was. I couldn't move. That includes my eyes being unable to focus. I was basically blind and mute with tears streaming down my face from the pain for two hours. It was awful. Then when they gave more morphine it basically didn't work at all. I became delirious from the pain and raved like a madman. Finally, the nurse taking care of me recognized the problem and gave me im to radio (not a narcotic but more like industrial strength Advil) I came out of delirium and recovered in relative peace.

I was 20 and that nurse was a 19 year old traveling nurse so I came back to the hospital once I could drive again and gave her my number. She was hit, although she really needed to tone down the makeup. She called me and we had one date before she got reassigned to California (i'm In New York) and we parted ways.

I'm married now and older with children, but sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I stuck with that traveling nurse. I remember in my delirium telling her that ""she saw my dick so she already knew what I was working with"" and she still called me. That's a keeper, fellas.

Then there was a number of discussions that happened in this sub about race in the fantasy publishing industry. So I decided to start a third card of books written by people of colour and Indigenous authors. I was actually pretty impressed with my tbr as I was able to pull the majority of the books I chose from that list. I had to look for some of the trickier ones though.

Books italicized have already been read. There's still a few squares that I haven't found a book for, or aren't quite sure if they'll fit but so far it's going pretty well.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;During her recent visit to Havana in July of 2014, Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), impressed by the country‚Äôs achievements in this field, praised the Cuban health care system:**‚ÄúCuba is the only country that has a health care system closely linked to research and development. This is the way to go, because human health can only improve through innovation,‚Äù She also praised ‚Äúthe efforts of the country‚Äôs leadership for having made health an essential pillar of development‚Äù** 

&gt;When the primary hurtle to becoming a doctor is the price of education and the government pays it all anyway, then it's easy to get a lot of doctors.

But you say money is the prime factor in innovation, why is the innovation and development so strong from doctors and researchers. The amount a doctor makes is less than a taxi driver by 30X. When you get down to it innovation comes from people that want to do something out of passion, not greed. 

&gt;Cuban art ... haven't seen or heard about that. Music everyone has lots of music, most ""Cuban"" music is actually Cuban exile music.

Not remotely true. 

&gt;The small businesses are recent and mostly tourist based, not a great transfer for the USA and Canada.

Again not true. 2% are tourist based. 

&gt;Cuba's medical innovation amounts to a handful of ""cures"" that no other country has bothered to use, that tells me all I need to know about it. 

For a poor country these are impressive acts. And your so call lack of innovation that you have been brainwashed. These rich people have the means to spread lies. America is spoiled, and needs a reality check. 


&gt;Perhaps the most well-known Cuban innovation is the vaccine CimaVax. Invented by researchers at the Center of Molecular Immunology (CIM) in Havana, CimaVax targets a growth factor in cancer cells in a way that can arrest the spread of the disease. It can be used as both a treatment for lung cancer patients and a preventive measure for people at high risk of the disease.

&gt;In addition to CimaVax, Roswell Park is also investigating Racotumomab and VSSP ‚Äî two more promising cancer drugs invented by CIM. Racotumomab targets a molecule that scientists believe is found on all cancer cells, which means the drug could one day be effective against blood cancers as well as the solid tumors that accompany diseases like lung, breast, prostate and colon cancer. VSSP, originally designed as a compound to help boost the immune response to vaccines, also appears to enhance the anti-cancer immune response. 

&gt;Head and neck cancers make up approximately 3 percent of all cancers in the U.S., affecting about 52,000 Americans every year. Alcohol and tobacco use, as well as human papillomavirus, are major risk factors of the diseases.

&gt;Nimotuzumab, patented in the U.S. in 1999 by CIM scientists, is a treatment for various head and neck cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (tumors that form on the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, throat and nose), glioma (brain tumors) and nasopharyngeal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies in the medicine attach to epidermal growth factor receptors on the surface of the cancer cell, thus preventing it from dividing and spreading the cancer.

Then he'd go party almost every night, workout in the morning, crank out 14 hours of work, and do it all again. 

I had always thought he was just very skilled, high energy, and hard working. but then I found out he skipped two grades, had the highest test scores in his school, tons of awards and got full ride academic scholarship to a very good school. He stands out to me because his intelligence is proven in the academic sense, but he chooses to hide that and focus on leveraging it for social interactions. A smart strategy. Anyways, it was annoying to work with because he was better at literally everything, better than anyone else in the company, and by a large margin. He was probably better at accounting than the accountant, better managing than our boss, better at cleaning than the janitor, and he just did sales because it was uncapped and he could make lots of money, and he did.

**The Thing (1982)** this is the first time I watched this. I just... I... I didn't know it was going to be so good. It's a good movie that happens to be horror. The effects changed my life, but even the drama in between is captivating. Now I want to see the other 2 versions. 

**Cigarette Burns (2005)** this was really enjoyable, but very obviously made-for-tv. Is the rest of Masters of Horror good? I've only seen this one and ""Family""

**The Open Door (2008)** A nerdy girl with overbearing parents and a manipulative best friend calls a radio station to make a wish, which comes true *but not how she'd hoped*!

I mean, we have 10,000 transactions per day, I'm certain only a small portion of those are coming from shibes on this subreddit.

Anyway, I'm not TOO concerned about utxo growth.  I think computer memory growth will outpace it.  Also, the bitcoin version that dogecoin is built from was pretty inefficient with RAM usage.  My bitcoin node is using 833MB of memory while my dogecoin one is using 1500MB, and of course bitcoin is used far more than dogecoin with many more utxos, so there must be something that could be improved massively in the software.

Its not like other subjects that you can just memorise or learn by rote, read about or even practise (though doing several of these will help).

You need to be able to understand it and what's worse is I'm not sure if its even possible to explain it with words.


I had several friends at uni who didn't get it, I may not know how frustrating it is to not understand something when everyone else understands, but I know how frustrating and heartbreaking it is trying to explain something and have no one understand.

Eventually, for some people they did get the hang of it, took a little longer but you could almost see that little click in their brains when they finally got it.

Others just ended up passing the module by memorising the likely problems for the exam.

For most of these people it wasn't an issue of intelligence, many of them were perfectly capable in the other subjects, often better than me, but there is something about coding that is just... different.


If you ever do decide to attempt to learn it again, the only advice I can give you is to break down the problem you are having into smaller problems, then break them down into even smaller problems and so on until you get problems so simple that you could solve in one or two lines, because that is the essence of programming.",1475280172

My advice to you would be to find the absolute best specialist you can to do your surgery if you decide to go that route.

&gt; Oil prices surged as much as six per cent Wednesday on news that OPEC had reached an agreement to limit production, but analysts remained cautious about the prospect of a sustained rally.

&gt; Noting the agreement&amp;#039;s lack of firm details, King cautioned against any expectations of an even bigger jump in the price of oil.

&gt; Michael Wittner, global head of oil research at Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; G&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;rale in New York, said the deal could &amp;quot;Potentially be very significant&amp;quot; not so much for the number of barrels it could take out of production, but because it signals Saudi Arabia is considering a return to active supply management.

Do you use a bench hook when carving? Those help to keep the plate stationary and keeps your fingers from in front of the knife.

Also, what material are you cutting into? Linoleum? Wood? Make sure the blade is specific to the material you're cutting, and sharp enough to make incisions without having to press down too much.

For the beginner students in our studio we use a material called Gumoban, which is more rubber than linoleum, but it's much softer to carve, so doesn't take as much pressure, which in turn alleviates a lot of hand soreness. ",1475280177

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Warning, academia is hard to get into. Lots of people with advanced degrees, and too few positions. Profs churn out grad students since they're cheap labor for research. Tenure can be difficult to get. 

You're doing this backwards. You're saying, 'I like math, what can I do with a math degree?' No. Instead look at what kind of career you want (or more practically, how do you expect to pay the bills). Then figure out what education will get you to that point.

Want to be a prof/engineer etc.? Well then do the research. What does employment in those fields looks like? What kind of engineering do you want?

You can always like math, or physics, or what have you. You can always have hobbies too. But you need a tangible strategy for employment. I have hobbies that I never expect to pay bills.

Also work experience comes out strong. So rushing to complete a degree in itself is not sufficient.

The school itself is of lesser importance, a lot of times as well. I mean, if you're choosing between Hoboken Tech and UCLA, well yes one is more prestigious. But you may discover it doesn't make much difference.

Taking pure math alone and physics alone, are more or less useless for employment. You may find out a guy who goes to trade school and learns welding may have a better shot at working than getting degrees in pure sciences.

Again: do career research. Figure out a career strategy. Figure out what degree(s) you need for that strategy. Pursuing interesting subjects, in and of themselves, is of lesser importance.",1475280178

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Im going to share with you something that happened to me a few years back.

I have had a few lucid dreams o er the years but didnt make too much fuss over it, just enjoyed the experiencs if you like. Then inception came out.

After that i sort of realised that what i called 'waking dreams' where actually lucid dreams. I was excited about this, i bought numerous books and read lots of stuff on the internet on culturing this state of conciousness. 

I had roughly 1-2 lucid dreams per month after practising for a few weeks. Most where pretty standard and inevitably ended up with me trying to initiate a sexual encounter with some hot female figure (what? Im only human!).

For some backstory i am 34 and married (happily). But who wouldnt choose to fuck a young entity in your dreams without your wife knowing? Anyway, after a few months practicing lucid dreaming i began to get better at holding on to a dream once i became lucid (a major stuggle in lucid dreaming is staying within the dream once you become 'aware', a lot of people wake up instantly when they know they are dreaming). I got to a point where i could 'stabalise' a dream by calming myself down and start asking questions to the characters in my dreams.

This isnt a 'i spoke to some people in my dreams and they told me some horrible shit' thing. For thw most part they were quite indifferent to my questions. I remember once flying over some chick i liked the look of, showing off, and telling her she was my creation. She just smiled like i was crazy and carried on with her day.

I will cut to the chase. The time i had an experience i still suffer from now is hard to explain. But i will do my best. Bear in mind at this point i was so confident of my dreaming ability i was practically calling upon dreams like a kid in a sweet shop. 

I was in asia, thailand i think. With my wife, and a few friends. I wasnt 'aware' i was dreaming yet (i now think because the dream was so 'real' i never performed my lucid tests.) 

Its hard for me to describe this now because what i exprienced was not in the same time scale as what we, as humans, are used to.

I lived a life in asia. Spent months hiking the jungles, speaking to monks, staying in different hotels, bedsits etc. I had a life there. Then it happened

There was a storm, a big one, raging clouds etc. And somewhere around here i performed a dream test (google it). It failed. I was dreaming.

How can i explain to someone that the last 6 months?? (Fuck knows how long but thats what it felt like)",1475280179

&gt; Oil prices surged as much as six per cent Wednesday on news that OPEC had reached an agreement to limit production, but analysts remained cautious about the prospect of a sustained rally.

&gt; Noting the agreement&amp;#039;s lack of firm details, King cautioned against any expectations of an even bigger jump in the price of oil.

&gt; Michael Wittner, global head of oil research at Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; G&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;rale in New York, said the deal could &amp;quot;Potentially be very significant&amp;quot; not so much for the number of barrels it could take out of production, but because it signals Saudi Arabia is considering a return to active supply management.

If you can, I would highly encourage you look into any direct trade coffee suppliers (Gotta keep from supporting slave plantations, right?) and try a lighter roast coffee from south america, one from central Africa, and one from somewhere fun, like Sumatra, and see what profiles you like!

&gt;&gt; No, a tenant cannot be evicted simply for having a roommate. However, a tenant may be evicted if the roommate is causing a problem for the landlord or for other tenants. For example, if the roommate is making a lot of noise, damaging the unit, or there are too many roommates (overcrowding), the landlord can serve a notice of termination and apply to evict the tenant and any other occupants of the unit.

As far as casual wear, simply switching from crew-neck to v-neck t-shirts makes a big difference. Also, don't be afraid to spend a lot on a couple good pairs of jeans. I'm not talking hundreds of dollars or anything, but if you think there's no difference between a $15 pair from the bargain bin and a $100 pair from someplace a little higher end then you are very sadly mistaken. And many of the more expensive types are more resistant to wear and tear. They'll last you years, so don't stress over the cost. Keeping your shoes clean and putting new laces in every now and then is another easy one. If you're going to wear a button-down, don't have the collar of an undershirt showing (the v-neck shirts I mentioned are decent for this, but your best bet is a good ol' wife-beater). Colored button-downs are usually ok without an undershirt, but most white ones can be pretty see-through, especially with the sun at your back. Keep that in mind. Also, keeping a lint-roller handy makes a massive difference. Linty clothes look dirty even if they're fresh out of the wash. I've found that lint rollers actually smooth out some of the lighter wrinkles as well, so it's a double! Speaking of wrinkles, iron your clothes. At least your shirt. You could be wearing a $300 dollar shirt, but if it's wrinkled that's all anyone is going to see.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt;isn't there 10bcf/day coming online in LNG exports in the coming 5 years?

Probably.  But we produce like 28 tcf a year, so the impact of 10 bcf/day is limited.  And that's just 10/bcf of capacity.  If prices maintain as they are today, we won't ship.  That fifty cents for transportation is just that, transportation.  Liquifcation, gassification at the port, and maintaining the LNG facilities on both ends as well as substantial losses during transportation will drive the cost up past profitability.

&gt;And the Utica field is pretty much exploding in production. Aren't they break even below 3$?

Utica is attractive for wet gas.  Nobody cares about dry gas for the foresseable future in Utica.

&gt;When gas went to 4$, a massive amount of drilling started to happen. And most of the shale gas is lower cost than conventional.

The land buying and initial drilling of nearly all our existing nat gas wells was done at $5-6/mcf.

With the exception of the 2008 recession and, well, today, nat gas hasn't been $4/mcf since 2003.  Nobody was drilling at $4/mcf except to hold leases.

&gt;The break even in a lot of oil wells is basically zero for nat gas. 

Yes.  The third reason natural gas is cheap in the US. Because it's a byproduct of oil (and wet gas).

&gt;That is why Chinese gas is not coming of the ground, it is in area's without good water sources.

Relatively little water is needed for fracking.  Millions of gallons, yes, but millions of gallons is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things, by which I mean, agriculture.  For example, I calculated once that more water was needed for the California marijuana agribusinessthan all water used in fracking in the United States.  West Texas is one of the dryest areas in the USA, similar to Chinese potential gas fields, and water was not generally a concern.

The Chinese aren't fracking because they lack the expertise and the infrastructure.  Because of the need for foreign workers, foreign infrastructure, and foreign heavy duty machines, all of which has to be imported from America at high cost, the cost to frack in China in many times more than in the United States - only a limited number of US personnel want to go overseas, and most of them would prefer to go elsewhere than China, making the cost to hire US talent sky-high even in a downmarket.  Fracking is the cutting edge of the oil/gas industry, and what works for one area doesn't work for another; the industry learns how to frack in the local geology largely by trial and error, and the Chinese market is inimical to American wildcatters who thrive on those conditions - mind you that the big oil companies like Exxon or Shell all abandoned fracking because they found it impossible to compete with the smaller mom-and-pop shops that dominate domestic oil and maintain their ROI; easier for them to work with megaprojects dealing with foreign governments.

&gt;And gas prices in Japan were still 10-12$ before fukushima?

Yes.  But Aussies have been targetting that demand for years with enormous floating LNG complexes that are some of the biggest, most expensive offshore structures ever built, and the US can't compete with them due to distance and getting a permit for an LNG plant on the west coast is essentially politically impossible on top of that.",1475280185

If you need to know how breeding works. Flip through that and part 2 and ask if you're confused at any part.

If your question is more geared towards where to actually start, that's a bit more open of a question. A Ditto with 6 maxed IVs goes a long way towards making any breeding much easier, but it's not really required. In my case I do a lot of wonder trade and GTS trading for dex completion and in the process I received a lot of people's ""breedjects"" ('mons people have too many of on their quest to get one with all maxed IVs), so for example I was able to start on 2 pairs:

3IV Fletchling / 4IV Ditto  
5IV Electivire / 4IV Ditto

With Destiny Knot in both pairs. As soon as either pair got an equally good (to replace Ditto) or better (to replace either) parent to put in, in terms of number of maxed IVs, I did. Right now I have both pairs with 2 5IV parents and still grinding away for 6IV parents. In the process I'm filling several boxes of breedjects already; about a box and a half each of 3 and 4 maxed IVs and half a box of 5s.

From there I can use a 6IV male to help breed towards another egg group, which is where a chart of the ""bridge"" pokemon between egg groups is really helpful. [I like this one.](http://i.imgur.com/10DSzjT.png) For example I might take a 6IV male Fletchling and breed it with a 3IV female Altaria to get into the Dragon group, get my eventual 6IV male Swablu and breed it with a female Charmander to get into the Monster group, and so on. Water1 and Field have the most connections to other egg groups so they're good to aim for.

If you have ORAS you can DexNav chain for any wild pokemon and get 3 guaranteed maxed IVs which provides a good place to start (catch enough and you might get ones with 4 or 5 maxed to start with just by random chance). In my case I used this method to catch a few 4IV Dittos to start with my 4-5IV traded breedjects. If you have XY you can instead start by catching babies (which, in XY but not ORAS, have 3 forced max IVs due to a programming quirk).

That's probably a lot of word salad but hope it helped some. Just my 2 cents.",1475280188

Don't skin until you've got it where you're going to butcher it (as it sounds like that's what you intend to do rather than take it to a deer processor).

Cool it as soon as you can, preferably in a refrigerator or institutional cooler.  

If you can get it cooling properly, you can wait a day or two before butchering it.  By the time you've field dressed it, dragged it to your vehicle, and gotten it cooling, you're going to be very sore and very tired.  

That said, it's better to butcher it sooner rather than later and get the meat into a freezer.

I've been doing it for 4 years now and I track everything on IMDB that I've seen... 2,180 films, documentaries and episodes of old syndicated TV (Magnum P.I., a million westerns, etc...)

The other portion of my job is getting all of our original shows and going shot by shot looking for every possible error imaginable and then sending them back to production to fix if needed.  Boom mics dipping into frame, detectable keying or compositing, major continuity, stuff like that.

I gotta tell you, I've seen some serious crap but I've also seen some amazingly powerful films too (Incendies, Chicken with Plums, Paper Moon, Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles, to name a few of my favorites) and I still absolutely love love love doing this job.  ",1475280189

"anime","t5_2qh22","Went digging and I found it.  I'm going to spoiler out some stuff just to be safe, but pretty much everything up to the last paragraph is stuff you've already seen, and even the last paragraph is a general thing about the show. 

&gt;Don't get me wrong, I love the whole series, it's easily my favorite anime out of everything I've watched. Episode 3 just kind of stood out as an even brighter star than the rest of the brilliant constellation.

&gt;To me, episode 3 was my first real moment of realization that Schichika lacked humanity, and truly was a sword, not just some funny goof who was a very skilled fighter.

&gt;Up until that point, the opponents had been tainted by the blades. The [Katanagatari ep1](/s ""Maniwa fought only for himself, and sought to eliminate Schichika and Togame right there. He had to die, both for self-preservation and to acquire the sword."") Even the bandits encountered on the road are violent and, if not for the mountainous difference in skill, could have been justifiable fatalities for Schichika as an aloof warrior. [Katanagatari ep2](/s ""Ginkaku was a more tragic character, and while he is more respectable than the first opponent, he clings to tightly to the past and is, again, openly violent, assuring Togame that the only way she can get his sword is to kill him."")

&gt;[Katanagatari ep3](/s ""Meisai is a totally different story to those two. She isn't just fighting to protect herself. She is fighting to protect all of her maidens in the shrine. She is the first to not have been tainted by the deviant blade, and instead is using it to heal instead of wound or poison. She uses non-violent means as a first method in an attempt to shake the resolve of Schichika, instead of immediately trying to kill him. She only resorts to fighting after she discovers the truth about Shcichika's character: he is not a human, he is a sword. By the end of it, I was almost rooting for Meisai, at the very least I wanted her to live, but Schichika did not feel the same way. She was an obstacle to be cut down, regardless of morality."")

&gt;For me atleast, this episode set the precedent for the beautiful character development throughout the series by allowing us to look back and see how far Schichika had come. Seeing him grow more and more human each episode made him such a great character, [Katanagatari Climax](/s ""and made the impact all the more potent when he learns of the darker side of human emotion within the last few episodes."") Again, I love the whole series, but this episode stands out in my mind, even among the amazing finale.

Yeah but their parents are responsible for everything that happened to them. Who's own parents are responsible, and so on and so forth until the evolution of the human species. So even by your logic, they still aren't responsible. Someone else is always responsible for everything that happens to you, even if they didn't do it, because it's their fault that you exist.

&gt;they are. they created a consciousness, a human being. They are parents

They no longer have any legal rights. They biologically created a child, but a good number of happily adopted kids would disagree with you on equating biological parenthood with actual parenthood.

&gt;I dont care? their actions resulted in the child getting hurt. it is their fault. I do not give a single fuck if they couldnt abort - shouldve used more reliable birth control if they didnt want kids.

So they should've kept it? Maybe that would've resulted in a better life - probably, OP doesn't sound like the kind of person who'd blind a child - but they thought they were doing what was best. They thought the kid would be better off. And it really *does* matter if they weren't able to abort. Were they supposed to kill it straight out of the womb then?

&gt;When should i start beating you to blindness? Oh Its obvious to you now that what im saying is absolutely bizarre? but my intentions are pure!!!!!!? doesnt that matter at all? dont i still get to beat you until youre blind? i only wish the best after alll, i would never do anything that would not benefit you!


They didn't do this to the kid! They didn't beat him! They didn't blind him! They didn't hurt him! Their intentions most certainly *do* matter in this instance because they aren't psychic! Who the fuck thinks their child is going to end up beaten and blinded? Who the fuck *wants* that to happen? Absolutely no one.

&gt;you actually acknowledge that it was their choice, and had horrendous consequences, but say it is not their fault? what the FUCK is wrong with you? did someone beat YOU as a child until you lost critical thinking skills? the fact that you are considered to be a ""valuable contributor"" based on your flair, is an absolute fucking disgrace.

It was their choice to give the child up. It wasn't their choice to beat or blind him. They didn't choose to abuse him. They didn't choose to do any of that. The choice was well out of their hands by the time the abuse happened. Some choices lead to consequences that are still not your fault. Even though they chose to put the child up for adoption, someone else chose to abuse him. Dozens upon dozens of choices were made long after OP and his wife had any sort of control. They didn't make anyone hurt this child, but you're still hellbent on blaming them instead of the people who actually did it.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You're welcome, I know it's hard to make sense of everything when you're in the midst of it.  You aren't crazy, you're just growing up and dealing with stuff, it's not ""who you are"", it's a period of time you are growing through.  I'm coming up on 26, so I'm not terribly much older, I just started seriously dating wayyyy too early in life.  As long as you want to be better, you can and will be.  Obviously I am not a therapist/psychologist/life coach, but I want to respond in full.  

I want to start by asking why did/do you wish you were someone else?  Why are you concerned with feelings of attractiveness/desire?  I ask because I notice that you mention it as a source of worry a lot.  Do you suffer with self-image issues in terms of how pretty you are or what you weigh?  Now, on the note of boys constantly talking about how hot girls are, well, that's the company you keep tbh.  I associate with primarily males and they are able to refrain from talking like pubescent teenagers, so it makes me curious, because that can also heavily impact your view of the world.  If you are constantly hearing about how hot girls are, it places a false importance on it, because it's really not the important...  

It seems like you compare yourself to others to gauge how important/good/skilled/etc you are.  Where does that come from in your history?  For instance, I used to have a terrible time with being criticized, like awful.  I would get pissed, aggressive, act out, and just be overall not great.  It stemmed from issues growing up with unfounded criticism and being put down quite a bit.  Once I grew past it, I realized that good people generally feel very bad about criticizing people, and therefore it's not meant from malice, it's usually meant from a good place (anyone outside of good people I don't bother myself with or take offense of).  So where do you see the history of your concern?  Some of these issues are easier dealt with through therapy, which is why I definitely recommend it.  

The most beautiful lesson I have learned is that I need to just become the best me that exists, and give that back to the world.  I don't have to be the fittest, smartest, wealthiest, hottest anything, I just have to keep on being me.  There are sooooooooooo many people on the planet, so comparing yourself will cause nothing but pain and envy, and you deserve so much better.  I see through your words a genuine passion, but a trepidation based in insecurity.  I think once that's gone, you'll feel sooo much better and you won't be jealous, and when jealousy pops up you will handle it with grace!

As for this breakup period, you should keep busy.  Stay active, stay sane as Teddy Roosevelt's dad said.  Start exercising, even if it's only 20 minutes a day, find new hobbies, join recreation groups in your area, just get out and keep your mind clear!

"ElectricSkateboarding","t5_32hd6","this is what it is going to come down to with the zboard. are you willing to invest time and effort into learning how to ride a skateboard? if you are then the zboard riding experience is amazing. its a great deal more fun and useful when you dont have to hold a controller and have both hands free but it costs... the cost is the time it takes to learn how to do it.

i have a zboard san francisco, i dont have a zboard 2... YET!!! i have one on order and maybe in a month or so i will get it. electric skateboards are not exactly easy to get your hands on and generally involves giving someone a bunch of money and waiting around for a stupid amount of time to get it. dont worry though because that wait is just to make you a little more emotionally numb to it all so when it breaks three weeks later and you have to wait weeks for the repair process its so much less 'painful'. they all break, i have 5 different ones and the only one that has never broken is the chinese ewheelin i3. boosted, metro-board, zboard and evolve have ALL broken. some of them numerous times.

if you really like the look of the zboard then go for it as there is nothing else that will match its riding experience. if you pay attention to what you see online you will notice that virtually all the people that dont like the zboard are people that have never had one. its not the fastest board or the most carvey board but its the only board you can ride with no hands like its a real skateboard. if you can swing the finances, i would order a zboard and a carvon. the carvon will get to you quicker and get you out riding. its much lighter than the zbaord and will be good for that reason even after you get a zbaord. the two boards will compliment each other and give you a wider range of how you can enjoy your electric skateboards.",1475280195

"skiing","t5_2qig7","I've done a few nice downhill tracks:

Wengen (the short version many times at 16 y.o. and opening opening for the European Cup)

Chamonix - Les Houches (FIS right after a World Cup, they usually take advantage of World Cup preparations)

Meribel

Tignes (upper and lower)

About the grip on ice: edges is only part of the equation. Speed/pressure is another. There's a part in Chamonix where you're supposed to cross a slope (that's how they put the gates each time). I had my training DH skis prepared during inspection. At the part where I wanted to go horizontal (stay on my skis and just push) I just couldn't hold on. Instead of going in a straight line horizontally I drifted downwards. I couldn't do a thing about it.

About turning: it's still turning although you might not finish the turn on some parts. So it might look like a ""C"" that's been trimmed down.

To me the issues have more been with beatdown tracks. Smooth ice is nice to turn on with the right speed and gear obviously. But when the ice has started to build a staircase your ski might not dig in as much and will jump all over the place. Your vision is also very blurred because it's so shaky, but somehow things just work. The OP video is pretty smooth I'd say but it shows the speed!

Chamonix part I'm talking about (don't forget the video flattens everything): https://youtu.be/lEUr4IknvIQ?t=40

"Celiac","t5_2tnai","I never intended to imply that we ate junk food prior to celiac. I see a large portion of the Gluten free labels also say No GMO, No additives etc. Like those a that are labeled as Organic. I did not say junk food or crappy eaters ANYWHERE. 

I wasn't a big junk food eater before, but I admit I miss being able to eat an Oreo once in awhile or go out to eat without doing a 30min review if I can eat more than a potato.

And wheat tends to be GMO, with wheat products having extra additives while they put wheat / gluten in foods to help give them that satisfying feeling. Unlike fresh fruits and vegetables that don't have gluten or extra additives, but we all wash to get bugs and *cringe* chemicals off of before we eat.

But there was no need to be so condescending with your Fun Fact: that pretty much proves my point on I didn't bring up junk food - I said junk in our food ( meaning the salt, msg , fillers, additives and more )And btw if you want to be snarky soda isn't always gluten free as I myself have attacks over some dark colored sodas and can only do clear soda.

Also just because they say additives in 90% of our foods are safe doesn't mean they are.  It was in my lifetime we were being encouraged to eat more beef and eggs to be healthy...that has changed as no longer safe now.

I am not some young hipster and honestly didn't think there was more to gluten problems other than the latest trends until I was diagnosed and my bread was taken away from me over a year ago. I have never weighed more than 100lbs unless I was pregnant. My diagnosis had me not only research Celiac but wheat, GMO and more.

I do not have a problem politely exchanging thoughts, ideas or even recipes.  I apologize if you felt I was being a self righteous condescending jerk. That was never my intentions. I do hope you feel better by insinuating I have zero knowledge on the topic though.",1475280203

"DungeonLink","t5_37raw","Hello! Welcome to DL and this subreddit. :)

Li meta sort of works this way:

1. Li is a very strong hero for how accessible/common he is. He is tanky, has good freeze on a good dash, has an AoE super, and his generic passive is useful on a large assortment of teams.
2. Because of all these reasons, you will see a lot of teams running Li in PvP contexts, especially in intermediate tiers.
3. Because Li is ever-present in PvP, this creates a metagame which makes all Fire heroes more valuable and all Water heroes less valuable in the PvP context.

Ann/Lulu question:

+ Why not both? Most intermediate PA teams will want to run 2PA and 3Crit, (e.g. Ann Lulu Li Didi Kiki) so unless you have a Driard, Ann+Lulu is probably a good combination.
+ Ann has a better typing and super for PvP
+ Lulu has a better super for PvE, and people like to bring Lulu friends into Dungeons so you might be able to get more friends / pal points if you set her as leader.

Trunks bases this on the fact that not only 18 smashed Vegeta, but also 17 took Trunks SSJ out in a single hit! You COULD certainly assume that Future Androids were only playing with Trunks and not using their whole power (even if they actually appeared pretty serious while fighting) and maybe Current Androids were actually using their full power (even if they actually appeared to be only messing around) against the Z warriors, but seriously, aren't you assuming too much?

Dragon Ball Z was never like that. All Z warriors usually know exactly the strenght of an enemy after fighting him. It happens like that since early in the series and repeats even in DBSuper.

My suggestion is that you focus on two channels:

1. Acquisition - learn how to effectively invest your money into campaigns that will provide a good ROI. This is tough, especially if you are a one-man operation. Dumping hundreds or thousands into  a marketing campaign can hurt, but it's the only way to really drive traffic to your site and start generating revenue.

2. Email - Email is the king of retention marketing. Once somebody has made a purchase from you, then you have the opportunity to earn their business again. It's important that you treat your customers well though, and your messaging should be relevant and timely.  If you send a boring email to the wrong person at the wrong time, you're not going to do anything. But if you send the right email at the right time - you can see some incredible ROIs",1475280211

"raisedbyborderlines","t5_33d8b","&gt;She ""left that hospital"", did she? I bet you're not the only sick child she mistreated... only their parents behaved like actual parents!

Its possible, that whole clinic was remade though, with all new doctors.

&gt;Other doctors are mistreating you too?? You need to tell your therapist, since your parents obviously don't care. üò°üò°

Oh, I have. Currently I'm not seeing any outright abusive doctors, but when I was last admitted to the hospital there was one doctor there give me some of the worst treatment ever, and turned everyone against me. 

- I had seen her twice before when I'd been admitted, the first time I went to a pysch hospital for conversion disorder, and the second time I had a really bad stomach bug and need IV fluids until it was over. 

- The first two times she was great, she made my top 5 doctor list. But then she turned on me, the third time I was hospitalized under her care, I was there for sever pain due to a hemorrhagic cyst and gastritis. 

- This doctor wanted to send me back to the psych hospital, even though I only had an acute issue, she told me I had left the psych hospital too soon, and had been ""emotionally damaged"" because of that. She told me I had a therapeutic relationship with the people at the psych. hospital, even though I explained to her some of their practices were questionable (threatening me with an NG tub unless I was able to lift all my food to my mouth). 

- She would talk to mom every day, for half an hour in the hallway, where I couldn't hear. 

- She would come in and tell me vague things, such as ""Certain evens over the last few days have shown us you cannot be discharged home."" and then refuse to answer my questions, saying I didn't need to know that. 

- I tried to get the charge nurse involved, saying I wasn't being told what was happening in my treatment and why I was still in the hospital after my pain had stopped, and the doctor called my mom to answer the question, without even addressing me.

Thankfully impatient doctors only work for 14 days at a time, and I was put under the care of a new doctor, and was sent home by him. After I had been in the hospital for 20 days.

But I also went to go see another team of doctors, that team had a resident on it that had also worked with that doctor when I was in the hospital. I was asked very strange questions by that team of doctors, questions like: After I said they had told me to take a vitamin D supplement everyday during a previous visit they asked ""And how many days a week would you say you forget to take that?"" 

That was probaby very scattered, sorry.

&gt;I'm angry about it! No one, especially not a child, deserves to be treated like that!! üò°

&gt;You have a right to be angry. I'm so angry right now on your behalf that I can hardly even type. Seriously! üò°üò°üò°üò°

Thank you, I don't know why but it just feels so nice to have someone angry on my behalf even if I'm not.

What if I own a piece of equipment and don't use it, but won't sell it to someone on the market for whatever reason - maybe I don't want to introduce competition in that thing, am I corrupt?

I would side with BastiatFan and IseeDrunkPeople. 

The market is neutral, not ""positive"" as you might like to see it function.

"TokyoGhoul","t5_315h3","I don't think a character needs to be SSS rated in order to be absolutely badass. In fact, the higher up the rank ladder we go, the less human and more monstrous they seem, hence the harder it becomes for me to actually see the character as badass. *To be honest, I really dislike characters with ""high power levels"" since they further they're the easiest way to introduce power creep and then throw it into overdrive.* Also a good way to disappoint fans if they expect their ""super powerful favourite"" to win.

IMHO Tatara was great as an SS rate, but his death was really abrupt and he could've really been used to further the story. He's, still, IMHO, the most menacing figure in the series so far. He'd have made a great long-term antagonist, at the very least for the Quinx if no one else. Yomo's on the opposite end of the spectrum but at a similar position. It's not that he was weak - as an SS rate on the mid/high end of the scale he's pretty tough. It's just that lately he doesn't feel as shrouded in mystery or stoic/effective, which was really his main theme. It's less about him losing to Arima and more about the implications of it (plus how lately he just feels... different? It might be the lack of screen time but he feels incomplete). ",1475280216

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I hate this argument.  Obviously, a women's body is a women's body, and they should be able to do with it whatever they want, just as men are.  And just as it took two people to make that baby, you are equally responsible for it. 

What we really need to do is drastically change how we teach young people about sex.  Things like: 

- It's okay for men to say no to sex, no matter what the condition may be.  Weather you just not be in the mood, or if you feel that you don't trust the person.  It is not emasculating, no matter what anyone says.  Hopefully we would also teach women not to get super hurtful when they are rejected, but  also to teach men to not get hurt if women do.  Their rejection is their problem, not yours.  If she wants to go around the entire school and say how you couldn't get it up, that is saying more about her character then yours. 

- Teach young men that just as women are taught there are a lot of bad men out there in the world there are just as many bad women.  The whole idea that ""women are the fairer sex"" is bullshit.  There are women who are irresponsible and often forget to take their birth control pills, or get black out drunk and very sexually aggressive, or just seriously want to trap you into a relationship with a kid, or are knowing or unknowingly emotionally manipulative.  Just because a girl cries or is upset, you don't have to do what she wants, she is a grown person responsible for herself just as you are. 

- Just as we are teaching women to not be ashamed of sex and sexuality, we need to teach men that it doesn't define them as people.  Not to use sex as a form of social currency that defines their masculinity.  It is not the quantity of sex you have as much as the quality. 

- There is nothing wrong with porn and/or masturbation if done correct and responsibly.  There is no shame in saying no to sex and then going home and jacking off.  That is fine, and often times the best thing to do.  We've all woken up next to someone and thought, ""why the fuck did I do that?""

I really hope this doesn't come across as bitter, this obviously not the case of all women, just as not all men are sexual deviants and predictors, not all women are irresponsible and manipulative.  I just personally feel this is what real feminism should look like.  Women should have to earn men's trust just as much as men earn theirs. ",1475280217

Local Red-Cross was giving away back-stage passes for a Warped Tour in SF in '08 (I think). Found out that by this point, I had already grown out of most of the bands, as I didn't know any of them (save for Relient K, and an up-and-coming Katy Perry). Yes there were some really good bands on the bill, but most weren't playing this show.

Anyways, Ex is a fan of Katy Perry, so we go backstage during ""Forever the Sickest Kids"" are playing, nope, Staff is starting to clear out backstage as it was close to 3:00. get shoo'd off for Safety reasons, and go get up close to the stage for the Katy Perry set. 

After the set, we go back stage again to try and see her as it's cleared up. She's due for an autograph signing in a matter of minutes, and she apologizes as she rushes off to make-up. She asks us to please see her at the signing though.

So we line up, and wait. We get up to the front, and are greated by a ""Thanks guys for actually waiting! you're so sweet!"" followed by KP hugging my ex so I can sneak a photo (body guard was pretty firm on the ""NO PHOTOS!"" rule, as he was standing by.)

Katy Perry is awesome.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","The fed has its own issues, as does restricting the money supply by tying it to the quantity of gold in the country. My comment has more to do with the amount of actual money in our economy. Credit works like real money, but it comes with debt. When you buy something with credit, money goes into the pockets of the people selling it, and the gdp grows. However, there is an invisible amount of money that the person who spent the credit has to eventually pay back. 

The amount of non-credit money in the economy is 3 or 4 trillion dollars. The amount of credit/debt is around 60 trillion dollars. This means the majority of Americans have most of their money going towards the credit/debt in heir houses, cars, and other life essentials they expect to pay back. Because people continue spending with credit, the economy continues to grow, as most people can continue to pay back their lenders and are still allowed to borrow. So people still spend and people still have jobs. 

But when a large enough percentage of people become insolvent, and can't afford to pay their debts, the credit money just disappears. That's what happened in 2008, and to combat the problem the fed kept lowering interest rates and printed 7 billion dollars, all of which was used to supply the economy with more credit. Which still doesn't fix the problem and only pushes it into the future. 

The fed could potentially fix the problem when the next crash happens, by printing more money and, instead of giving it to the banks, just providing a minimum income to every citizen, in order to replace the missing credit. That's what I think at least. ",1475280219

A few years into my current relationship I'm way more sexual, have discovered I have a very high sex drive, and I'm starting to try to think about what I want, though expressing myself is still a little uncomfortable. There is hope, though, is the point of that.

Simply put its impossible to just stop letting your sense of attractiveness and being desired rest on sex until you replace it with something else. You can't have a void. I would suggest talking to your gf, expressing your feelings and making it very clear you aren't (in this Convo at least) asking for more sex, you're asking for her to show that she is desires you im whatever way is natural for her.

The vid acts like it's a tired formula of fighting the same bad guys over and over, but really, that's how all beatemups are, even the best ones.  He used comparisons with Final Fight, Sailor Moon, and Alien vs. Predator, which are all very good beatemups, but have notable differences if you play them (not to mention they were not on Genesis, so I don't understand what point he was trying to make).

In the end his bible was shredded, and he decided that he would stick to his religion instead of his education.

So a competent judoka can whip the shit out of you and it'll be jarring, but you'll land the right way and not do much damage (assuming you're smart enough to tuck your head and not post your arm). Someone with poor takedown skills can mangle you even if you know how to fall decently because they're putting power into the wrong angles and compensating with muscle, so instead of your center of gravity being lifted and pivoting over a point you are smeared into the ground below them at weird angles. This is the danger I find practicing with unskilled people who weigh a lot more than me.

Now, I actually have very mild HPPD and I'm not anxious about it all, it's just kind of there. I don't have to focus on anything, I just see mild tracers and tiny flashes of color, much like during a trip. 

I think you might've been anxious about developing HPPD, so now you're hypervigilant about looking out for the symptoms of it. 

If it brings any comfort, HPPD usually tends to resolve with time :) For me, it's never been more than 2-3 months. 

And I wouldn't really call HPPD brain damage, if anything, most hypothesis for it are more about forming new connections in the brain and shit like that, I'm not a neuroscientist so idk, but Google if-it's some interesting stuff. ",1475280226

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I posted this on the thread over on /r/civ as well, but figured I'd add it here as well. 

The themes for each civilization are actually real music from their respective cultures.  The American theme is *Hard Times Come Again No More* by 19th century American songwriter Stephen Foster, while the English theme is the traditional folk song *Scarborough Fair*.

For anyone curious, the French theme that we [hear at 1:35](https://youtu.be/sFlxSgOEZrk?t=95) is an old renaissance tune attributed to Pierre Attaingnant, a French music publisher from the early 16th century.  Here's a [more traditional arrangement of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68bfFtg92ek), and [here's an awesome adaptation of it from Italian power metal band Rhapsody of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxx6CEosOPQ).

Overall, the implementation of this music is really cool to hear.  Civ IV and Civ V definitely made use of music fitting the civilization you were playing and the era you were in, but I love how they took it the next logical step for this game and assigned specific leitmotivs for each civilization that grow as you progress.  Hearing that Steven Foster tune build up through the Industrial and Modern era homage to Aaron Copland is fantastic.",1475280228

Roxxy is nice and has been gifted probably the most obvious and in depth rudemption arc, but I feel that she is possibly several episodes past when she truly should have went home. To be fair I think she realised she's been very lucky and seemed to accept that her time was definitely up, at least from what we saw.


Tatiana clawed her way back and had a lot of drive to keep going. It's such a shame that she was kicked straight back out the door because of Alaska making it a purely personal decision in not wanting to kick out a friend. I thought Alaska was better than that.



In fact I think it should have been Detox and Roxxxy in the bottom two with Roxxxy leaving. I think Detox's and Tati's videos were about on the same level, Detox's might have been slightly funnier but there was no scene change it was all just catchphrases from one talking bin.

"spacex","t5_2srow","Here's an abridged version of a post I tried to make earlier this week that was deleted upon submission (reasoning was that it should have gone in one of the megathreads):

Prior to this week's reveal of ITS, many of us theorized that the spaceship portion would include some sort of launch escape system, and with the recent mishaps it almost seemed like a given. Obviously, with the massive scale of the ship, there is no way accelerate the entire thing quickly enough to avoid an AMOS-6 type scenario.

Myself and a few others envisioned a seating area at the very tip of the spaceship that would house the occupants during launch and acceleration events - it would essentially be a detachable capsule which would have the sole purpose of propelling itself via solid boosters or some other means away from the rest of the ship in the event of a RUD.

As a community, I think it would be a good thing to discuss possible launch escape systems and to attempt to determine why SpaceX chose not to include any. The obvious reason would be that perhaps even a smaller seating section as described above would still be too massive to accelerate and propel any reasonable safe distance from an exploding booster, considering how large such an explosion would be. I'm just throwing a crazy idea out there, but perhaps instead of one large seating area/capsule, they could split the seating area into smaller sections/capsules mounted into the generally forward facing portion of the ship that would abort up and away from the ship at different angles. If everything goes as planned and an abort is not required, then these capsules could possibly be used as living quarters. This design might not be compatible with the huge viewing window currently envisioned by SpaceX and would naturally add a good deal of complexity to the overall design of the spaceship. 

Let's be honest with ourselves: this is an entirely new vehicle using a new fuel and new engines with never before used fuel tanks at a scale that has never been done before. There is a huge amount of risk involved, and we can't just hope that nothing will go wrong. An explosion with 100+ people on board will seriously risk ending the continuation of any colonization efforts. After seeing numerous rocket mishaps over the years, not just those by SpaceX, I personally do not think I would travel on a rocket that does not possess a launch abort system, and I'm as big a space nerd as there ever was - I became an aerospace engineer because I wanted to help make stuff like this happen somehow. And yes, there is an inherent risk in space travel that involves the risk of death, that is for sure. But Dragon 2's launch escape design had me hoping for something similar being implemented in ITS, and I can't help but feel that the design of ITS is a bit of a regression in that regard, excited as I am to see this thing launch.

This is patently false. I've said this twice now: I said that there is no evidence that it exists. That is **not** the same as being certain that it doesn't exist. **Please stop misconstruing my argument.** 

&gt; No, there is no reason to call both legal and illegal immigration the same thing.

Literally nobody disagrees. What you're doing is conflating ""illegal immigrant"" with ""illegal immigration."" The latter is fine, because immigration is an action and one can illegally immigrate. The former is not, though, because a *person* cannot be illegal. It's legally, semantically, grammatically, and otherwise incorrect to refer to someone as an ""illegal immigrant."" To put it in other terms, the phrase calls the immigrant illegal. 

&gt; we are also not allowed to even point out the difference between legal and illegal immigration.

says who? this is a distinction you and only you are making. 

I'll do this one more time, and if you choose to continue ignoring what I'm saying then that's on you: There is a difference between ""illegal *immigrant*"" and ""illegal *immigration.*"" One refers to the *action*, the other refers to the *person.* You are very openly (and, at this point, intentionally) claiming that ""the left"" wants there to be no distinction between the *action* of legally, and you claim that 50% of the population agrees. But then you cite people who object to the *language* as evidence that those same people want to erase differences in the *action.*

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","So, if you think about it, my house is U-shaped. The front is two full stories with attic above it (space for the sloped roof). HVAC and water heater up there. Not usable for storage.

Then there are two arms stretching off that. One is master suite, with  a floored attic above it. Making that high enough to have a usable room on the second floor would have added substantially to cost. One has the kitchen and family room on the first floor, along with a half bath, laundry room, small office, and garage. Ceilings are high in the kitchen and family room, lower in the office, laundry, and garage. There is a bedroom, full bath, and playroom above the garage/office/laundry. Ceilings slope in there, but unless you're right up against the wall it doesn't matter.

The space on the second floor connecting the front to this second arm is the enclosed storage attic. It's about seven feet tall at the center, so too low to be a regular room. Again, raising the roof would have been expensive. It's very easy to enter from the front side - just a regular door with a step down to the lower floor height - but the exit to the over-garage suite requires two steps down and stooping very low to get into the playroom (again, you don't care about high ceilings in the garage and those rooms, so there's enough space to have two usable rooms with lower ceilings vs one with 11 foot ceilings and one space with very low ceilings).

Does that help any?

&gt; &amp;quot;A party is probably the best way to fight off depression,&amp;quot; said Rolf Densing, director of operations at ESOC. Carrying a suite of 11 scientific experiments and a small lander named Philae, Rosetta was launched in March 2004.

&gt; The spacecraft finally launched in 2004 on a new rocket, and with a new target: Comet 67P. During Rosetta&amp;#039;s 12.5-year journey through space, the spacecraft hit many milestones: It sailed past Mars and two asteroids, but most importantly, in 2014, it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet, escort the object around the sun and then deploy a lander to the surface.

&gt; To get every last bit of science out of the expedition, ESA managers decided to end the mission by landing Rosetta on the face of the comet, snapping high-resolution images and analyzing gas and dust on the way down.

"GiftIdeas","t5_2qpt5","I'd recommend asking him directly if he's into that kind of thing and, iff he is, then get promise rings together, either *not* as a gift or as an exchange of gifts (i.e., he picks out the one you wear, you pick out the one he wears). Some guys might go for this, but a lot of guys wouldn't.

But think about what this kind of a gift is saying: ""*I'm* buying *you* a symbol by which *you* promise *me* that *you* will be faithful to *me*"" or ""I'm buying you reminder that you swear to be abstinent, but it's completely unenforceable and will only have the effect of making you feel a little guilty maybe if you don't follow through with your promise!"" Perhaps I'm missing the point of a promise ring, but it sounds less like a gift and more like a burden. Maybe a little bit of both.

To me, getting this as a gift for your boyfriend for Christmas would be comparable to a man proposing to a woman on her birthday. ""Happy birthday! I'm offering you the chance to spend the rest of your life with me! Best gift ever, right?"" How self-absorbed. But at the same time, if he *is* into this kind of thing, he may completely disagree with me. So you should talk to him about it.",1475280234

i mean, look at the Duluth model: it's objectively and openly sexist and pretty much negates male victims of domestic violence exist at all, yet it's one of the most common programs in the united states

i don't see how that could happens if those minorities were that small, they clearly have some degree of inluence right?

Worst: Gareth &amp;lt; Lehran &amp;lt; Vika

Before I get flamed for putting Micaiah so high, I want you to legitimately think about her huge availability and the amounts she contributes every chapter. Every chapter she's in, she contributes in *some* way, whether it's nuking armors or being a healbot. Force deployment helps a ton. IMO Micaiah is severely underrated.

Opinions on some units that seem to be popular now:

Nolan: Not that good at all. He's essential for like 3 chapters and then gets outshined by Sothe, Jill, and Volug like the rest of the DB.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Two examples of our problems were: (1) we both thought each other didn't 'get' our concerns anymore and (2) that I didn't express enough empathy for her. 

The advice was to listen to each other and really try to put ourselves in each others shoes. Also, to realize that people have different definitions of 'wrong', 'saying sorry', 'taking responsibility' and 'acceptable'.  Just because one of us felt that something was wrong, didn't mean the other felt the same way.  Just because I felt like I had empathized and said sorry, didn't mean my wife heard it as an apology or that she felt I was empathetic enough.

We started to develop ways of listening to each other without judging and making it about us.  It's a hard concept to grasp, but if I am upset, that's really about ME and not about the person or situation that was there at the time.  If I can be with my wife when she is upset, try to understand, but not take it personally, then I can empathize about what SHE is feeling instead of trying to defend MYSELF.  As soon as I make it about ME, I lose the ability to relate to HER and what SHE is feeling.

Have you heard people say ""You can't MAKE others happy!  You can want them to be, can try to help them be, but ultimately it is up to them to decide to be happy or not"" ?  That's the concept to get - that each of us are responsible for how we feel - others don't ""make"" us happy or sad.  Two people in exactly the same situation can feel differently - it's how THEY decide to react.  Most of the time this reaction is subconscious - it's just how we learned to react.   

We both followed up counseling with personal development courses that helped us uncover our learned behaviors.  It's not that they are always bad - we learn for very good reason how to react in different situations and most of the time it is very helpful.  It's when the default reaction isn't the right reaction that we can benefit from seeing what we are ABOUT to do and chose whether or not to follow through with what we are feeling.

You can't control your thoughts - but you can control your words and actions.

*****
&gt; &amp;quot;A party is probably the best way to fight off depression,&amp;quot; said Rolf Densing, director of operations at ESOC. Carrying a suite of 11 scientific experiments and a small lander named Philae, Rosetta was launched in March 2004.

&gt; The spacecraft finally launched in 2004 on a new rocket, and with a new target: Comet 67P. During Rosetta&amp;#039;s 12.5-year journey through space, the spacecraft hit many milestones: It sailed past Mars and two asteroids, but most importantly, in 2014, it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet, escort the object around the sun and then deploy a lander to the surface.

&gt; To get every last bit of science out of the expedition, ESA managers decided to end the mission by landing Rosetta on the face of the comet, snapping high-resolution images and analyzing gas and dust on the way down.

Next year, instead of picking the green toms cut out the entire plant just above the roots.  Prune off all of the leaves and branches that don't have fruit and hang them upside-down in a cellar, garage, crawlspace, etc that is warmish and doesn't get too cold.

*****
&gt; &amp;quot;A party is probably the best way to fight off depression,&amp;quot; said Rolf Densing, director of operations at ESOC. Carrying a suite of 11 scientific experiments and a small lander named Philae, Rosetta was launched in March 2004.

&gt; The spacecraft finally launched in 2004 on a new rocket, and with a new target: Comet 67P. During Rosetta&amp;#039;s 12.5-year journey through space, the spacecraft hit many milestones: It sailed past Mars and two asteroids, but most importantly, in 2014, it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet, escort the object around the sun and then deploy a lander to the surface.

&gt; To get every last bit of science out of the expedition, ESA managers decided to end the mission by landing Rosetta on the face of the comet, snapping high-resolution images and analyzing gas and dust on the way down.

I'm in my early 30s and am independent. My Nparent moved out of state this summer (THANK GOD), and some time before that, I went NC and have stayed NC ever since. I can totally relate to how awesome it feels to go NC. It's great. :) 

My issue is that I'm realizing now, as a young adult, how much of my personality has been formed and f--ked up by nearly two decades of abuse. For example, I don't trust anyone, am hypervigilant, have interpersonal issues, don't deal well with stress and am very hard of myself. Basically, everything that was screamed at me as a kid, I still have with me as an adult. Classic PTSD. 

I've got 3 decades under my belt of operating with a mentality of an abused kid. I'm noticing how much of my survival systems no longer serve me--even worse, they work against me in my adult life. :( It all causes me pain. It sucks. But it's my default setting at this point. 

Hoping I can find the right treatment to get me to a place where I can become my own person, and not just a collection of traumas that lashes out at the world. I don't know, though...it's hard for me to believe in myself. :-/

One of my top priorities would be getting that 401k going again.  Not at the expense of late fees on credit cards, but I'd be pumping my 6% into there before making extra payments on the cards.

That's a 100% ROI in the first year plus whatever returns you get from the investments.  Since you're going to pull yourself out of this in 2-3 years, the extra CC interest is less of a loss than losing the 100% match and tax free growth.  

Can you try using less energy to hear and cool your house?  Keep it in the low 60's this winter and 80 next summer.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Think of it like this - Yogg casts the spell, then gives it to you before it resolves.

You never ""cast"" the spell, so no pyromancer triggers, no gadgetzan no mana wyrm et c  
But you do own the spell once it starts going off, so you draw off of Sprint, it checks to see if you have played another card yet for Combo (not including Yogg, he hasn't finished being played yet), you discard to Soulfire, and you get Overload (overload is part of the card effect not the cost, look at Counterspell for precedent)",1475280257

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","Yeah it's beautiful. I'm still trying to figure it out completely but the characters are really a deconstruction of superheroes.

The only real superhero with super powers, Dr. Manhattan, due to his super powers, is so ultimate that he can only concern himself with himself. He is detached from humanity as we appear as ants to him. It critiques what a super powered person would become. He's cold, detached, foreign to all suffering, and immune to all passions.

Rorschach is the one with the greatest commitment to virtue. To truth and justice. And being in the real world with crime and pain and evil, it made him insane. It made him hate humanity. It made him bitter, cruel, a killer, judgmental (towards homosexuals and liberals). He can't let go of his vigilantism. 

The Comedian shows that not all people who would take up arms against crime would be good people. It also shows that faced with the insane amount of evil in the world with not so simple answers (Vietnam), it'd be easy for a hero to give up on humanity. On morality. On everything and become an nihilist. He's a rapist. A killer. A deplorable human being.

Ozymandias is the most ideal hero. He has an undying commitment to goodness and a hope in it's realization. You couldn't imagine a person with a better character who seeks to make energy free and create world peace. And he's the ultimate villain! Because even he is driven from this great place and commitment to goodness to murder millions and lie his way to it and he does this because of his commitment to good.

Silk Spectre shows what would happen if someone, even a hero, loved a superhero. Nite Owl is just along for the ride. A middle aged out of shape guy who wanted to do some good and retired.

All these characters show what would happen to real people when thrown into the world of immense evil, moral ambiguity and complexity, and with other heroes. The story itself giving the greatest sort of morally complex situation. Killing millions to save billions. Creating world peace through lies and murder.",1475280258

You're talking about interest rates and lending. You and your ilk look myopically at interest rates. A *much* bigger factor is the lack of supply relative to demand. In attractive cities around the country, housing construction has been enormously restricted by zoning laws, etc.

OK. Is this like a relative of that phenomenon you claimed to observe in me? You know, not ""desperate to impress through verbosity,"" but ""desperate to feign nonchalance and aloof bemusement""?

Johnsons polling is flat. This is a problem. We could be in a Nader situation all over again, a nightmare situation

Johnson can't even get above 5% Nationally and Hillary is still leading. Show evidence minorities are going to surge vote for Johnson. 

&gt;Sure, she's still here, but this is a 24 hour new cycle, and lets not forget, she's already lost an election. 

It's been a 24 hour news cycle for 25 years; she lost the primary to Obama, not the General election, and she only barely lost in delegates but won the popular vote. Don't compare trump to Obama.

Neither is anything you're saying is just guessing and negative campaigning. No proof, no evidence, no facts.

"RATS","t5_2qnh3","Hm...if this has only been happening over the past week, that's odd. Now, a year old is a pretty common time for rats to slow down naturally- I can't speak from personal experience with girls, but I've had quite a few boys and they all chilled out around 12 months- and I know that girls tend to do this as well.

However, this is typically a gradual thing. I can think of a few things that could cause this...

1. Your girls are just slowing down as they get older, and either they're just oddballs and it really is this sudden, or they have been slowing down gradually and it only got to the point where you started noticing it recently. This is definitely a possibility, especially given the fact that *both* seem to be slowing down without any apparent health issues. Their timid timidness at being picked up could simply be them reacting more strongly because they haven't been being picked up as much lately. However...

2. Lethargy can be a sign of illness in rats. I would definitely keep a sharp eye out on their food and water intake, their breathing (put your ear to their chest, bellies, or sides- any unusual sounds?), and any increase in sneezing or porphyrin buildup on their noses. Lethargy can be a sign of many things- tumors are a possibility (though I am leaning towards a different explanation because the probability of each independently developing some sort of tumor at the exact same time is low), as are upper respiratory infections (however, they seem to both be in pretty good health...). Definitely be on the lookout for any degradation in their health, rats can get very sick very fast, but I'm not convinced that's the problem. My *guess* is...

3. Some kind of environmental change has put them off. Any new smells? Particularly people or animals? Are you using any new litter, personal hygiene products, or cleaning products? Has the temperature in their living space changed recently, or any new drafts introduced? Or, have you changed how often, what times, or the ways in which you interact with them? If you can't think of anything like that and you don't notice anything different with their health, I'm inclined to think it's some variant of 1.

Again, definitely be on the lookout for health changes, but I don't think this is something to worry about:)",1475280265

"symphonicmetal","t5_2sf4u","Every single one, of course. They're all really awesome albums.

I'd recommend going to listen to Design Your Universe and The Divine Conspiracy first, then Requiem for the Indifferent and Consign to Oblivion second, then Phantom Agony then the two albums Jansen did with After Forever. I chose that order based on the similarity in sound/style to TQE and THP.

Or go in chronological order if you want to see how their sound developed over the years. 

The Phantom Agony is much more ""classical"" in tone.. it's not as heavy and a bit ""slow"", but it is dark, complex and moody.

Consign to Oblivion is heavier, faster, but lighter in tone and general feel.

The Divine Conspiracy is more bombast than CTO. The style of this album is where Epica really starts to adopt their current style.

Design Your Universe keeps the bombast, refines the style from TDC.

Requiem for the Indifferent is such an underrated album. The production isn't as great as the previous/yet-to-come albums, it's not as ""bombast"", but it's dark, very progressive, moody, and a really great listen.

Also worth mentioning are the albums Prison of Desire and Decipher by After Forever (the band Mark Jansen was in prior to Epica). They really are the spiritual pre-cursors to what would become Epica, so definitely check them out!",1475280269

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","Ok, this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I just have to say it; 
I think the song is awful. Ok, maybe not that bad, but it's pretty bad. 

When it comes to visuals, this opening nailed it, it honestly reminds me of a mixture of bloody stream and chase (Which are my favorite OPs) and I just love how Kira is such a big presence. There are just a few things I don't like in this OP's visuals but it's nothing that bad.

But the song...Oh my god, they should've just kept chase. I'll be honest, when Crazy Noisy  Bizarre Town came out, I kind of liked it, it was a weak OP when compared to the others, but it was nice. 

Chase was the most fitting for the second half of DiU which is much darker since it deals with a serial killer instead of some high school kid with a stand, and that's where the song fails; It does not fit in with any of the upcoming events. 

If you think about the upcoming events in DiU, many of them are either dark or violent, chase would fit in much more, specially because of the title; Chase. 

They are chasing after the maniac who killed innocent people and friends, a man who stole the identity of a bystander and will be the cause for a lot of pain to come, not to mention the brutality of the final battle.

Great Days should've been the song for the second half of DiU and chase should've been for this final act. Heck, if it was up for me it would be back to the drawing board with Great Days. 

With that said, i'm now really worried about the OP for part 5 because that part has some really brutal moments and fights, I hope we don't get another sappy ""Great Days"". 

tl;dr - ""Great Days"" does not fit in with the upcoming events and I personaly find it to be a very sappy song and thus dislike it.",1475280270
"pics","t5_2qh0u","I'm aware of that. But the topic that was mentioned (and that always shows up on Reddit from people who don't know better) is that physicians and ""big pharm"" are some evil Willy Wonka that hand out narcotics like hot cakes. As someone who requires a pain medication regimen, I imagine you know that no well-meaning physicians want their patients to rely on pain medication if it can be helped. So I argue with those people who bitch at physicians without knowing all the details and suggest ways like physical therapy, regular exercise or alternative methods that are forsaken for pain medication. But then there are individuals like you who obviously need pain medication on a regular basis and then my argument looks like I'm belittling people who have legitimate chronic pain. 

It's like defending physicians and their paradox when helping chronic pain patients automatically gets you blasted on this site. I've worked in medical settings where people regularly show up with quite obvious fake chronic pain as well as people who get discharged from the hospital/physical therapy and show up in the emergency department 2 days later because they fell getting out of bed due to the pain that should have been dealt with. It's frustrating debating with people who have 0 experience in this field and only know how to parrot people saying that there's an epidemic of painkiller prescriptions. It isn't false by any means but they think it's the physicians shoving Oxycodone scripts down people's throats, ignoring the fact that the only reason the physicians have to write those scripts is because patients decide that it's the only way to deal with their pain (which may be real or exaggerated).",1475280270

I was going to go to the mall with my old friends which was awesome because I was shy and still hadn't made any friends in my new place.  I guess the stress and excitement got to me, because about an hour into the drive I got a pretty bad headache. Then my vision got blurry, then I got nauseous, then I was convinced I was dying.  I told my parents and my dad was super casual in telling me that it was a migraine, he used to get them a lot, and that I'd be fine in a couple hours.  Needless to say, it was a pretty miserable car ride that ended in my throwing up a couple of times in a Walgreens parking lot.  Once I got into the lovely hangover stage I had a snack of low quality preserved sausage and cheese (which I didn't know I was allergic to yet).

Of the two I have no contact with, there's the crazy one (I've explained just how crazy here before, but rest assured, this is legitimate delusion, not ""oh, my crazy ex""), who I broke up with and bear no ill will towards, but never want to see again, and the one who shattered my heart into a million pieces a little under two years ago, which I'm only just starting to recover from now.

How come there are a lot of older people that are very happy with their lives and are still full of life yet there are monks that have resorted to cutting off their genitals and have even committed suicide?

The less doubt the better in the case of ordination and becoming a monk. 

What if all monk hood has to offer is just being a monk and never attaining enlightenment because it does not exist?

What if we are wrong and a balanced life is the best life?

We don't know until we have experienced both sides of the coins, everything else is a guess. The Buddha encouraged others to find the truth for them self instead of believing everything he had to say blindly.

"GaryJohnson","t5_2rxc8","Go back a week and I would be inclined to at least partially agree with you on not primarily running a national campaign, and instead primarily focusing on a few states like NM, CO, UT, with the national campaign run as a secondary. 

As of today I completely and utterly disagree with you. This is because of four things: 

1. The debate. It was shite to put it politely. Whilst Clinton ""won"" that debate, it was lacking in substance and was a he said, she said battle. GJ's search trend numbers went through the roof (relative to before) during that debate. His FB likes etc starting increasing at a rapid rate, after stagnating. He's just surpassed 1.6m likes. 

2. The ""name a leader gaffe"". The media spun the shit out of this story, and again it led to a wee rise in searches for GJ. Whilst this story the way it was spun is not a good look, we know what truth was, that is, the question was ""name a leader you admire and look up to? But the key thing is our name was put out there again. Now couple this with points 3 and 4. 

3. The Detroit News and Chicago Tribune endorsements. If you search for GJ now, the top search (at least for me), is the CT endorsing GJ.  There are other articles that are hit pieces, but in amongst them are news articles (from the major newspapers as well) on the two newspaper endorsements. These two papers are respectively big papers in their own right as well. TDN is one of the two big papers in Detroit. The CT is one of the top ten papers in the country by circulation and is the most read paper in the Chicago area (or second, depending on the source you look at). These endorsements are big, and are only adding to the new momentum we're starting to see since the debate. 

4. Jeb Bush. Rumours about JB quietly endorsing GJ surfaced. He has ruled out HRC and DT, and is looking at GJ, and has reportedly suggested to vote GJ. He's stated it's not a binary choice this year and is at peace with his decision. Hmmm, take what you will from that. Sure it leaves open the possibility that he may not vote at all, but the way this story has played out, I think he may well be voting GJ. But the thing is that the media made a story of this, and again GJ is in the spotlight, but for a good thing. 

Put these four things together, with the starting time frame being the debate, and you get something the two big players don't have, that is renewed momentum. Yes we stalled, but we're on the up again, and if GJ can stop, repeat every question asked to him, in his head, and then reply in order to minimise gaffes or ""gaffes"", we can hit 15%, for at least the third debate. The two big paper endorsements has created a lot of media attention, especially the CT endorsement. A top 10 paper endorsing a third party candidate, why I never!!! 

I would argue one thing, and have been for a month now, and that is a change in strategy is needed to help build towards 15%/winning some states. Focusing on only a few states can be part of that, but in terms of a nationwide campaign, something needs to give within the campaign. I was hoping a new strategy would have been put in place immediately after the first debate, but it was not the case. It would have been an excellent moment to strike. 

But overall, this past week tells me we shouldn't focus on just a few states, and that a nationwide campaign must remain the primary focus, albeit with a chance in strategy. ",1475280276

The other issue might be just me being weird, but there isn't a playback speed option, and I always watch gaming content at some level of speed increase. This is also the reason that I don't watch regular twitch replays unless it's a fighting game tournament (which is already as fast as I can handle). Videogames are made to give the player time to make decisions, but since the viewers aren't making those decisions and are just watching someone else do so, unless they talk about everything they're considering, or really fill that time with good discussion in some way, it's just too slow without 1.5x or 2x speed.",1475280280

"ProtectAndServe","t5_2ug10","Well, let's be real though, the NA/carribbean slave industry was on a whole other level of brutality. Things like prisoners of war becoming slaves have been in human society for a long time, but harvesting slaves from civilian populations without a war in place for other reasons were pretty rare. And the industrialized brutality of the ships they were brought over on, the auctions, and the brutality of plantation life on many plantations were aberrations from the historical norm of most slaveholding societies. Finally, the creation of a caste and slavery as a ""trait"" you can inherit from your parents was also extremely rare. The form of slavery practiced in the Western hemisphere was almost uniquely brutal and evil in human history. Although neither you nor I own slaves, it's also true that the past affects the future. If your parents are poor, you're more likely to be poor. If your parents are rich, you're more likely to be rich. Layer that with the fact that black Americans didn't get the vote until the 20th century, Jim Crow lasted to the 60s, etc, and it's not hard to see how our current society is as racially fucked up as it is. We can rightly point out that many/all of BLMs demands are insane without papering over or ignoring the fact that our fucked up past affects our fucked up present.

More seriously though: given that Let's Play videos are kinda focussed on a game made with a legitimate license, and are a major marketing tool for Indies, it makes no sense to pay for stock music. Creative Commons is fine. Custom music is great. Stock music? Not so good.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","It depends on the game. For example putting a slow loading game like GTA V is beneficial because it cut the loading time than more than half but it's still a long load with an SSD, while other games it won't really make that big of a difference for example battlefield 4 where if the server is transistorizing into a new map the match will only load when every player has completely loaded in.

Fpr Rogue Survivor Revived's architecture, at default settings each district takes 1 hour 40 minutes of game time to walk; the choice of district size 50 keeps the data size low enough to allow negligible delay when keeping all 25 districts in memory at once and using a second thread to play those districts without a PC -- with the currently released AI.

I still get tired easily, get visual issues, and the occasional brief dizzy spell, though those are all becoming rarer and less severe when they occur.  At this point I'm back to maybe 70% normality - I can drive, run errands, do light housework, and so on with little trouble, though everything does take me longer than they once did.  But every day is a little bit better than the day before, recovery no longer dominates every waking moment, and, as discouraging as it may feel right now, if you can stay focused on the incremental improvements you'll do great.

Ten thousands acts of bad behavior of men, claiming to be godly or clergy, against 300,000 that believe in God is a big difference in the US.

Its not just 12 crazies. Have you not seen on TV them dancing, shooting guns in the air and saying death to America? The top religious leader in Iran preaches destruction of Israel and America, and calls them little satan and big satan. He preaches to untold millions that follow his dictates. 

Men are evil and good. Being christian means a lot or a little, it depends on the level of commitment of the individual. Many religions say an American that blows up a Fed building is a christian just because many nations think of us as christians. But the individual may not be religious at all.

No, it does not justify bigotry and hate and distrust, but we can go by what the ones that say they want to rule the whole of earth say. ",1475280282

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","Far more important than the specific morality of the candidate the US chooses to be President, probably the most important issue with regards to America biblically would not be the immorality of the country itself (there are many, many countries which would compare ""favorably"" to the US in terms of immorality), but rather what sets the US apart from the rest of those nations: their aggressive promotion of unbiblical ""human rights"" in other countries. 

For example, there are several Western European nations that have had homosexual Prime Ministers already, like Luxembourg, Iceland, etc. There are western European countries where the people are probably even more immoral than Americans are, according to those Pew surveys of what people find acceptable in various parts of the world, which we all read about once or twice a year. However, no one can accuse Luxembourg and Iceland of aggressively promoting the acceptance of immorality in other parts of the world or regionally. 

A lot of EU nations have homosexual marriage, and the US was a lot slower in adopting this than many other countries. But even so, America is the only country, or at least the main country, aggressively promoting unbiblical ""human rights"" all over the world, including homosexual rights. America even has a ""global envoy for homosexual rights"", an office created in 2015 http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/02/237772.htm. 

American values, such as free speech and  freedom of the press, are not actually biblical values, and are in fact directly contradicted in scripture, for example Ecclesiastes 10:20, Provebrs 24:21, and others. And yet America has taken an opposite position on these things, and literally twists the arms of other countries into adopting American norms as gospel. And we can see how all this does is spread immorality and unbiblical norms of governance into other countries. 

This is something which sets America apart from the rest of the world, and it is not a good thing. Biblically, it would be far better for America to have a President who himself may not have morals which agree with the Bible, but who would also scale back America's aggressive diplomatic behavior in some of these regards. This is probably the #1 thing to focus on for America from a Biblical perspective, in my opinion. 

From that perspective, a lot of Trump's, let's just say, ""less than democratic"" statements, for example his admiration for Putin, etc... might be viewed in a much more positive light than you would first think. 

It is a sad thing for America that they have to choose between Hillary Clinton and Trump, but from a Biblical perspective the discernment issues surrounding Trump are a lot more complex than simply what HE does with HIS mouth and what HE does in HIS OWN life. If he were indeed to scale back America's involvement in foreign affairs, as he has made pretty clear he would do, this would only be a boost for America from a Biblical perspective. ",1475280286

about 3 or 4 hours after taking them, I noticed the effects were slightly off. something strange about it idk. I have a strong feeling that these are presses of a cocktail of different RC or synthetics (but not fent). It reminds me a lot of tapentadol, but not quite the same high. This guy could be mixing U47700 with tapentadol, which is a fucking stupid idea. Tapentadol if you've never had it gives the oxy-like euphoria for a while, then it feels pretty shitty after about an hour (in high doses it lowers seizure threshold so not good to abuse). U4 and tapentadol are both cheap as hell to order from China.

stay skeptical. this is all subjective btw, maybe they're real. Placebo effect has a huge impact. Also I've only been off of subs for 72 hrs, usually need about 96 to fully feel oxy. ",1475280288

In summation, I really don't understand what you are talking about.

Oh, and they continuously buff and then nerf the same guns. The shotguns get buffed but then people complain about getting one shotted (by a shotgun) so they nerf them again. Can someone explain how you get a hitmarker at point blank range with a shotgun? Might as well take shotguns out of the game because they're either too overpowered or too underpowered.

Literally it seems like ever since this supply drop bullshit got introduced into the game, they lost focus on some of the actual problems and are more worried about putting stupid fucking dances/melee weapons/other into the game. All those problems I listed above (minus the bogus hc-xd complaint and the hit detection) were never problems in any of the past call of duty's. I don't know, maybe I'm just nitpicking. ",1475280293

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

He is just being stubborn and thinks the heat are looking to dump his salary (which probably has some small truth behind it). I cant believe Riley announced they were not trying to bring him back. Wouldnt you think they would be better off leading him on and then have him continue to fail tests to show that he cannot make it back? Who decides how many times he can fail and not get an opportunity back on the team?

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","&gt; Smaller mag size has significant impact on engagement time and number of targets you can kill

Again, pure supposition; engagements don't exist in a vacuum.

&gt;If I come across and flank 5 guys with a Gauss Saw, I can take them down; with a Godsaw I'll be switching to a pistol halfway through

Unless you have absolute carrot aim, that is pure nonsense. You seriously need more than 65 200dmg bullets to take 5 dudes out? You have more to worry about than reload times.

&gt;The faster magazine reload wasn't enough to make it useful in high-tempo situations

Of course it is. That is *exactly* why it's better, because the fast reload after multiple engagements will often put you back to *more* bullets left than someone using a deeper mag, with slower reload, who is scared of making the long reload for the next set. The Godsaw has the same reload time as the Saw S, which has always been seen as rapid for a high dmg LMG, let alone one doing 200dmg.

&gt;Critical number is ~2-3 seconds. 

Where have you pulled that arbitrary number from?

Stories about dads that are afraid of their kids going to stay with their mother that is now dating a registered sexual offender. Stories of men that have spent years and years fighting to get custody and not winning even though they would provide a more healthy living environment for their kids. 

The courts will always give custody to the mothers when possible. It's what they prefer because our society still thinks that mothers are better caretakers than fathers. 

So, I would love to see you go up to these men that have spent thousands of dollars and years of their life fighting to get custody of their kids, only to get denied.

Though you would not really know it from looking at this subreddit and also not to hate on the aesthetic since I do really like it myself but minimalism is actually over. If you look at runways and street fashion shots of editors from prestigious fashion magazines etc. many of them are wearing super luxe/crazy grandma Gucci clothes covered with bright faux fur and brocade. 

I think you could absolutely walk into a vintage shop right now and buy some amazing on trend pieces. I also think you could successfully wear things from the 60's etc. but it requires a shift in styling perspective from when vintage was a big craze.

Where is the female end exactly? Is the one end that I thought was the 4-pin PWM actually a 5-pin female end then? This is interesting!

So let me bug you for a sec and pick your brain if you don't mind :) 

I have 4 controllers in total. 3 of which will be needed to accommodate all 8 fans. So I could use a cable to connect Controller 1 to Controller 2, then another from Controller 2 to Controller 3, then a final one from Controller 3 to Controller 4, located *outside the case*. Then they could all be simultaneously controlled by that exterior controller. 

Now, even though each controller is connected via the 5-pin connector cables, will each of their independent 4-pin PWM leads need to be connected to the motherboard?

I'm really excited now hahaha! This PC has already cost me more than my budget so I'm entering into sunk cost fallacy territory anyhow. Might as well shell out some money for cables if it's easier than splicing shit!

[CGP Grey explains why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) (First Past the Post = Winner Takes All). The short version is that, the better a 3rd party does, the more likely it is that the people who voted 3rd party will end up with their least favorite candidate.

-

The only way we can fix that is if we collectively demand that our elected officials restructure the voting system. We'd need to withhold votes from candidates who don't make it part of their platform and stop reelecting people who haven't made a concerted effort to get legislation passed to change it. [CGP Grey explains the alternative vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE) Basically, you get to vote for your top 2 candidates. Once all votes are tallied, the candidate with the least # of votes is eliminated and the votes are transferred to the 2nd choice candidate listed. Keep eliminating the candidate with the least # of votes and transferring them to the second choices until there are 2 parties left and the one with the most votes wins.",1475280305

My cousin is a mom to 5 at 31 years old. All of the kids have problems.

(17) The oldest is insane and mentally diminished. She knows sexuality gets her attention, so she uses it.

(15) The next is a bit of a diva, but she's my favorite and my buddy. She's smart (or at least gets good grades), but extremely quick towards violence.

(9) The middle is a boy who has never known a strong masculine figure in his life. He's all over me because I'm a Marine and I'm very strict. But his idea of cool is a 9 year olds idea of cool, so he's a bully. Good kid, just needs a father to show him actual cool shit that he can talk and even brag about.

(7) Girl, she's a super sweet heart, she had all of her teeth pulled because of neglect and she withdrew so much, but I was always there and didn't give a shit so she draws for me all the time. Honestly the drawings are shit, they are the worst drawings I've ever seen, but she lights up when I hand over crayons and a paper plate (her thing, I don't get it) so it's great

(4) Boy, he's a little underdeveloped for his age but is always smiling. He's so fucking cute. 

Anyway, a few months ago I came home to all of them at my house (I live alone minus my great dane) and mom there being all retarded and shit, crying that she needed a babysitter for a few hours. It was like a Wednesday or something and I didn't care, cool. We had to order out because I'm a 28 year old single dude so my fridge had beer and a half eaten bag of pizza rolls. 

Anyway we ate, the youngest four passed out after eating 10 adults amount of food and the oldest sat on the couch next to me while I sat on the computer doing some work. She said her phone was dying so I told her she can plug it in at the charger next to me and she said ""okay, but definitely don't go through it"" and I told her that I respected her privacy and won't touch the thing.

Craziest thing happened, she said ""Oh, I don't want you to go through it because you might like it too much""

That moment was the one where I said I need to be really distant with this girl.

It was a mistake, I knew who she was. She's the same girl that tried sucking her dads dick. She doesn't know affection, but she knows sex and she can't figure out the difference and she desperately needs told some Fred Rogers shit.

So I ignored her, like a dumb ass because I don't know about this kind of stuff.

A bit later she goes 'Uncle Dumbass' (I know they are my cousins, they call me uncle) and I turn around and she's sitting on the couch masturbating, looking directly at me. I wigged the fuck out, called an Aunt on the other side of the family to come help me out. Explained the situation, sat in front of CPS for a long time, took blood tests and had hair samples taken.

I feel bad about the oldest, I wasn't around enough for her because I was in the service and probably could have helped a little.

But it breaks my heart that I can't see the boys. The other girls are actually pretty okay. We hang out, the second oldest girl acts like she's too cool but we used to talk so much. Great kid. The other one always told me about what she was learning about in school and drew me pictures and I loved every second.

But the boys, oh god I was a hero to them. They literally don't know any adult male that's a family member. I come from a family of women, and I loved teaching them how to fight and why not to fight and how to be kind.

Haven't seen them in months, not allowed to. And I did nothing wrong. Such sweet kids.",1475280306

I'm not trying to invalidate your anger or pain. ESPECIALLY not yours because you have been exposed to some shockingly inappropriate human behavior on your hunt for embryos. But I do want to give you the flip side.

I haven't talked about it on this board except in some PMs to people because I hoped we'd never need to use them, but simultaneous to our FET we did a donor freeze-all cycle. Yes, huge amount of money just to hedge our bets but our odds were so low with the FET that we figured we'd need them and there was a complication that the only thing that had made us comfortable with DE was the donor herself, and we would lose her if we didn't execute on the contract by a set time. So we did it, thinking worst case (or best case) it would be the biggest karmic payback if we were able to adopt them out. The round actually didn't go all that well by DE standards, but we did end up with a cohort of 3 PGS normal AA blasts that it looks like we'll adopt out pending nothing going sideways after this FET (which is obviously still a long journey). I hadn't talked much to husband about said adoption but the topic came up this week.

My husband is not religious. In fact, he's a scientist. He's definitely not pro-life or Jesus-y in any way. And his list of requirements for what needed to be a requirement to adopt these embryos out was significant. Nobody who'd had repeated unexplained losses (or even repeated losses). Nobody who couldn't get their lining over 8. Nobody who couldn't pass a Matriss U/S. High preference for somebody who had already carried to term. This was before he even talked about what he'd want in people he was adopting them out to.

Because you see, even though he's not ""the embryos at all costs,"" they're still his kids to him. There was just a thread on here just recently about how people loved their embryos even when they were just at two cells and wanted to sleep in the lab with them. That's a real thing. And people who are donating embryos are largely (though not exclusively) donating them because they feel that way and want to give the potential humans the best life possible - or even just the best chance at life possible. It would be nice to think that embryo donation is about wanting to help people. But in truth I suspect for most people or couples donating it's not. It's about loving these potential children because of the genetic factor. So, it's possible that your clinic is just a bunch of a-holes padding their SART scores and billing you. But it's also possible that they really are trying to respect the wishes of the people who are donating their embryos. And observationally, I think donating embryos may not come without some pain. I know that he, and even I though they are not genetically mine, would love nothing more than to transfer all 3 and have all 3 take and have all of them as children, but that's not a responsible or even feasible reality for us. There's clearly a level of sadness for him in donating them, and he wants to be sure he has a say in making sure they get a good chance. It's possible that the reason you have to go through this horrible thing, which is *definitely* dehumanizing and this clinic seems to have handled poorly, is just because somebody loved your future children before they were yours and the clinic is trying to respect how those people feel.

Though, truly effed up that this wouldn't be required with your own embryos. 

I hope this didn't offend you. You know I have all the respect for your journey. But this thing that is completely and unfairly hurtful to you may be a requirement that originates in the love and hope that some couple or individual has for the future people they made. And love is never a bad thing.",1475280307

The point is that if you aren't poorer is harder to understand the difficulties that people go through, especially if you don't even try to have empathy and see a different perspective. It's exactly the same with the question that was made above. Men will never have to be in a situation were they might have to do an abortion.

"math","t5_2qh0n","In his book https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/blog-book.pdf , Terence Tao writes:
""The material implication ‚ÄúIf A, then B‚Äù (or ‚ÄúA implies B‚Äù) can be thought of as the assertion ‚ÄúB is at least as true as A‚Äù (or equivalently, ‚ÄúA is at most as true as B‚Äù). This perspective sheds light on several facts about the material implication:

(1) [...]
(6) Disjunction elimination. Given ‚ÄúIf A, then C‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf B, then C‚Äù, we can deduce ‚ÄúIf (A or B), then C‚Äù, since if C is at least as true as A, and at least as true as B, then it is at least as true as either A or B.
(7) [..]""

What‚Äôs the point of thinking of an implication A --&gt; B as asserting that B is at least as true as A in order to understand the disjunction elimination? In know that ‚ÄúA or B‚Äù has the biggest truth value of the two truth values of A and B. Thus if C is at least as true as A and also at least as true as B, then ‚ÄúA or B‚Äù is at least as true as C (since ‚ÄúA or B‚Äù has the same truth value as A or as B). But why does this shed light on the disjunction elimination? How does the viewpoint of Terence Tao help me understand the disjunction elimination?",1475280310

As far as my initial impressions go, there are 2 flaws that stand out at me :
* The boost looks melted and flat compared to retails ( Although it's comfy, I wore them for a 6 hour shift working retail and I had no discomfort). Personally I couldn't care less how the boost looks since no one is going to be looking there.
* The strap should be the same tone as the  suede, but here it's a shade darker. In some of the pictures it looks considerably darker, in others it's just a shade darker. It's worth noting in outdoor lighting it's not as noticeable, but I can see how it would bother some people.  I do agree that I wish there were reviews on PK/BYJ/JWS's version, but judging from all those seller's pics I dont see anyone having fixed the strap color flaw.

I came out of denial myself. I was already in therapy and coming to my sexuality was a natural progression. There was no harsh comment from anyone that knocked me out of it. If harsh and honest comments is what knocked people out of denial, you would have more people getting sober, losing weight, attending anger management, etc.

I'm sure every single stakeholder in the internet, Liberals, conservatives, The US, China, Russia, free speech advocates and so-on would like to have control, to the extent they could, in their hands.  However, the moment this happens all the other folks will say ""this stinks I'm out of here"" and go create their own internets - and they can, its really pretty simple to do.

I'd rather vote for someone who works to make money, not works to take other peoples' money.

Given that hillary took bribes at the state dept. for pay-to-play (I can post the emails of proof if you want to challenge me) that gave people shit like fucking ambassadorships...why would she not do that with the supreme court and such if she had the chance?

I'm not willing to take that chance.  I'm willing to vote for the person who hasn't lead a life of corruption; someone who hasn't taken money from people only to reward them a job.  I'd rather someone who is willing to pay THEM to do a good job.

Please, keep going.  I will continue to blow you out of the water.  You still haven't learned.  The more you respond, the more I'm going to point out that hillary is an evil person and if she didn't exist, a lot more people would be alive on this planet and a lot less corruption would exist.  Do you disagree with that?  I'm not wishing death, I'm proposing the thought that if she never existed, would there not be less corruption in our govt. that was fostered and by HER?  ",1475280321

"badphilosophy","t5_2sa6z","&gt;It seems like you've taken ""police must be 100% safe at all times"" and made that their prime directive... We expect firefighters to risk their lives and soldiers to risk their lives,

Not quite, but ""be safe"" is the ""prime directive"" for almost every profession. Soldiers, firefighters and other rescue operations always, *always* say ""you're number one, your team is number two, the perp/rescuee/enemy soldier is number three.""

Go talk to a firefighter or a soldier and ask them about this.

You cannot ask anyone to engage in a situation in which their own safety isn't paramount.

That doesn't mean it can't be taken too far, but I think that goes back to training.

&gt;This is why those professions are publicly respected and well-compensated. 

I would argue every profession you've mentioned is woefully under-compensated, which is why we have half the problems we do. Imagine if we really could get the best and brightest to be cops and soldiers.

&gt;I don't accept that our police will randomly execute misbehaving children and the mentally impaired

... How on *earth* have you interpreted anything I've said to mean I think this is acceptable?

A cop should not be expected to sacrifice his or her life for a ""misbehaving child.""

&gt;I've heard examples of police taking lots of time and effort to take in a potentially dangerous, mentally unstable person without killing them.

It generally is. But that doesn't mean it's reasonable to expect it in every situation.",1475280321

"pics","t5_2qh0u","vice did a documentary, DOPESICK, about the fentanyl problem in alberta, canada, which involves real users.
bootleg fentanyl comes from china and the volume vs. profit compared to heroin is extraordinary (as you can imagine from the image). 
it's becoming increasingly common to cut drugs like heroin with fentanyl because so little is needed for such a strong effect, but the problem is that dosing is not done properly, they don't have the means to do so. so every pressed pill or baggies have uncontrolled amounts of fentanyl in it. 
even if you buy ""fentanyl"" from a dealer, its mixed with other things (it almost has to be, because it's so strong). but its so hard to get the dose right.
so, it's often people will do one line and OD. 
scary thing is it's starting to show up in other drugs like cocaine as well.

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","I love tabletop games, some of my earliest memories are of pestering my parents to let me stay up late so I could watch them play D&amp;D (the geekness is strong in my family).

BUT, I am not confident in my abilities to RP in a group. This wasn't helped when a couple of years ago I tried my first D&amp;D campaign (and tabletop RPG ever) with some people I knew and my PC was killed off at the end of a quest when she fell into a trap that couldn't be detected in any way, and was devoured by a giant spider (why is it always spiders?!). One of my teammates then tried to rescue her and got himself killed, bless him. Anyways at the end of the session it turns out that the GM felt he had to punish me somehow because he felt I wasn't playing my alignment correctly! Okay... I admit, I had no idea what I was doing and didn't really understand the nuances of alignment, so maybe I was messing up. But the whole experience really put me off and I dunno, it turned what was supposed to be a fun exercise into me worrying that I can't RP, am such a noob that I deserve to die! ;) I haven't played a tabletop RPG since ~sad violin music~

My question is this: what would your advice be to someone who isn't confident at group RPing? Is there an etiquette that first timers should be aware of when it comes to RPing? Is punishment from a GM normal if you aren't following the rules of how you should be RPing something? Is there a good entry level game for someone like myself who wants to RP but needs to build up their confidence and/or acting skills (and if they suck at it they aren't gonna die and lose their character. (She was an awesome character by the way, think Brienne from GoT! She coulda been a legend one day!! She didn't deserve to die!!! I'm not still salty about it...))

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt;&gt; No one needs to change the transaction format. The replay attack can remain possible, that's not a problem. All you as a holder have to do is to install both wallets on a computer and then send the same coins to different receiving destinations.

&gt;So you are suggesting that replay attacks won't be prevented at all. A lot of users may lose funds in replay attacks then, since they will attempt to use their software (original or forked) as they always do. And they will get attacked in the process. You're basically saying ""the exchanges are smart enough to protect themselves, everyone else is on their own.""

It will be impossible for any user to lose any coins after a hard fork, if they use an updated version of Mycelium that is programmed to take care of the replay attack automatically. The user of the wallet has to do nothing. The wallet app will *automatically* and behind the scenes take care of the splitting which makes the users' coins immune to any replay attacks.

&gt;There's no reason *not* to prevent replay attacks at the protocol level (in a hard fork) unless you are afraid that this lends credence to the original chain and will prevent users from migrating back to it (or never leaving in the first place). In other words, by not including replay protection in a fork, you are setting up users (on both chains) to lose money in replay attacks purely out of political expediency. Seriously, if you're going to hard fork, change transaction format to protect everyone involved. This is a no-brainer.

There is simply no need to defend against replay attacks on the protocol level. That is a problem that can and should be easily solved on the wallet app level. If Bitcoin Core wants to change their transaction format unnecessarily then we big blockers won't stop them. But we consider our version of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency to be the original Satoshi Nakamoto version so we won't change our transaction format. We are the original and the Blockstream version of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency is the modified copy. They can do whatever they want to their version, we no longer care about that. 

&gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll be slower than the replay attacker and sometimes you'll be faster. All you have to do is to be faster just once

&gt;Or be slower, just once. And lose everything on one chain (or the other). 

You are incorrect. If you're slower then you will still lose nothing on any chain. I just explained to you how to split your coins completely safely with a 100 % certainty. Read what I wrote once more and if you still don't understand the method I described, I suggest that you search the /r/Ethereum subreddit for ""replay attack how to split my coins"" for more pedagogical explanations. I originally learned it from one of the comments there. You can even ask them because to the Ethereum people this is common knowledge after their experiences with their recent hard fork that resulted in ETH and ETC. 

&gt;&gt; So, the replay attack can be allowed on the protocol level because it's trivially easy to split any coins after a hard fork using existing wallets. 

&gt;Fork proponents better engage in a massive education campaign to inform users how to protect themselves well before the fork. Remember, this reinforces the idea of a network split, and may succeed in making a hard fork more contentious. Currently, I believe that many don't understand that a hard fork creates a second, distinct and incompatible network. 

All that the end user of a wallet app such as Mycelium for example need to know is if the version of Mycelium is recent enough to automatically defend their coins against replay attacks. There's no need for any massive education campaign as you suggest. That's just either ignorant on your part or intentional FUD.

All that the end user needs to know is that their wallet app is updated to be able to handle both Bitcoin currencies after the fork and then they'll find two currencies in their wallet app after the hard fork instead of just one. If they don't know anything about the blocksize limit debate that's been the main thing happening in Bitcoin for at least two years now, then the Mycelium app can just display a message ""Your app version is too old. You must upgrade to the latest version before you can use the app."" Problem solved. 

&gt;&gt; I don't think that Gavin would be against a hard fork that results in two separate Bitcoin currencies. Why would he?

&gt;We should ask /u/gavinandresen. Like I said, he was very upset at discussion of network splits in the context of XT. I think he firmly believes that a hard fork in Bitcoin would be successful.

You're describing a time when we big blockers thought that compromising with Blockstream was a possibility. We no longer believe that after Blockstream chose to not agree to our final 2 MB compromise proposal (Bitcoin Classic and BIP109). I still think that he would support an intentional split both in currencies and in communities. We no longer want to compromise. That's why we big blockers stopped supporting BIP109 and nowadays support Bitcoin Unlimited with the default 16 MB limit setting. 

&gt;&gt; So the only possible way forward is that the small blockers and the big blockers go separate ways after a hard fork. That, and simultaneously, we create, support and use a Bitcoin spinoff (/r/btcfork) that spins off without any voting at all from the existing Bitcoin miners. 

&gt;If you mean that miners should not dictate if/when a hard fork occurs, I very much agree. I'm glad that we can find common ground here. You are free to fork open source software as you please. But I do reject using miners to leverage hash power (thus, transaction confirmations) against users of the original chain to provoke a hard fork.

It doesn't matter what you ""reject"". You can't stop us to offer miners to mine on our Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork. You can (and will) DDoS our network because you small blockers have done so previously. But we are simply too many people for you to successfully DDoS us all. We are offering the existing miners to leave the Blockstream version of Bitcoin and join our Bitcoin Unlimited version of Bitcoin instead. 

Simultaneously and independently we are also starting at least one Bitcoin spinoff currency lead by ftrader. We will have at least 3 separate currencies with 3 separate and competing exchange rates, all with the historical ledger identical so that everyone will have their initial coins in all 3 currencies. We don't care if the small blockers ""reject"" this. This *will* happen, it's only a matter of time. All you can (and do) reject is changes to the Bitcoin Core software that Blockstream has successfully hijacked. 

&gt; I see that as economic coercion, and a clear miner attack. I think a hard fork should be based on organic user support -- i.e. code the fork and allow users to freely migrate, without any pressure from miners. Bitcoin's rational mining incentive works such that if users by and large agree to the fork, miners will rationally follow right behind them. 

It's not economic coercion as you call it. That's just silly. It healthy competition where there is 0 risk of anyone losing any coins in any way. Every current bitcoin holder will automatically hold the exact same amount on all 3 future versions of Bitcoin. All 3 Bitcoin versions will have separate exchange rates and everyone is free to trade any of them. There's no ""attack"" and no ""coercion"" as you claim. We tried cooperating with you small blockers. You refused. So we are competing now. And you'll lose (or stagnate to be exact).",1475280330

"history","t5_2qh53","There are two important examples of this in Chinese history.

* The first is the Nine Tripod Cauldrons. Tripod cauldrons, called ""ding"" (Èºé), are bronze vessels that were used in Ancient China for cooking, storage, and ritual offerings to ancestors or the gods. Later on, tripod cauldrons came to symbolize power and authority over land, and so the ruling dynasty started regulating the usage and possession of tripod cauldrons - scholars were restricted to one or three tripod cauldrons; government ministers were restricted to five; vassal lords were entitled to seven; the Son of Heaven, aka the nation's sovereign, was the only person entitled to have nine. So significant and potent was the political symbolism of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons that merely inquiring about their weight was tantamount to challenging the authority of the Sovereign and the ruling dynasty.

    Legend has it that the first dynasty of China, the Xia, divided their domain into Nine Provinces and received a tribute of bronze from each of the Nine Provinces. The bronze tributes were then cast into the Nine Tripod Cauldrons symbolizing each of the Nine Provinces. Eventually, the Xia dynasty was overthrown by the Shang, and the Shang dynasty in turn inherited the Nine Tripod Cauldrons. The Shang was itself later overthrown by the Zhou dynasty, which also inherited the Nine Tripod Cauldrons and used it as the symbol of the power and authority over all of China. As the power of the Zhou waned, it became divided into various warring states that vied for dominion of China. Qin, the most powerful of these states, conquered all the other states, including the remnants of the Zhou. The first Qin emperor, Ying Zheng, ordered the Nine Tripod Cauldrons to be transferred from the Zhou capital (Chengzhou) to the Qin capital (Xianyang), but was lost during that transfer. Other accounts state that the Nine Tripod Cauldrons were instead lost during the shift from the Western Zhou period to the Eastern Zhou period (when the capital of Western Zhou, Haojing, was sacked by barbarians, and the capital was transferred east to Chengzhou, thus the name Eastern Zhou).

    Historians however think that the Nine Tripod Cauldrons were likely exclusive to and originated with the Zhou dynasty, since the Shang dynasty placed greater importance on ritual wine vessels as opposed to ritual food vessels, which is what tripod cauldrons are. Also, the existence of the Xia dynasty is yet to be confirmed archeologically, making the account of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons originating with the Xia highly unlikely.

* The other example is the Imperial Seal of China, which was carved from the He Shi Bi, a famous large jade disc artifact from the state of Zhao (one of the states during the Warring States period, conquered by Qin). The First Qin Emperor ordered its creation, and though the Qin dynasty fell after just three rulers, the Imperial Seal was passed to the Han Dynasty that followed it. The Imperial Seal became the symbol of power, authority, and most importantly, legitimacy of the ruling dynasty. It continued being passed down through several dynasties even after the collapse of the long-ruling Han dynasty, and eventually it came into the possession of the Tang Dynasty. 

    After the collapse of the Tang, its fate became unknown - one account says it was lost in the resulting chaos after the collapse of the Tang Dynasty. Another account states it came into possession of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, and that after its overthrow by the Ming Dynasty, was lost. As a result, the Ming Dynasty and especially the Qing Dynasty that followed it became obsessed with making many imperial seals to dilute the importance of the Imperial Seal of China, since they don't have possession of it.

A non-Chinese example is the Irminsul of the Saxons, famously ordered by Charlemagne to be destroyed during the Saxon wars. The Irminsul is usually a decorated tree trunk that represented the World Tree in Germanic paganism. The Saxon Irminsul in particular was the focal point of the Saxon religion and its chief holy site.",1475280336

4. I thought some companies had drop-off at the actual airport itself. I'm sure I used to see a sign for that when you pull up to departures
5. For the hire car scenario you'll be paying a premium for dropping the car off to a different location than from where you rented it, unless you plan to go out to the airport first to hire it and drive back to Richmond

Personally, I think you are afraid of how people on here may respond to the question. I made no reference to censorship. The question itself seeks to explore the compromised rationale involved with claiming both impartiality and partiality (by way of endorsement). Could, for example a company that manufactures cigarettes be objective about the health risks of the product?

In the world of international business, ethics is always in flux as even media outlets could be owned, by businesses that make harmful products.

I started with a couple of 23w CFLs in a bucket and i've upgraded up to LED/DWC (but I still grow in soil too) so i've had/ironed out my fair share of problems in a variety of mediums. Plus Nirvana always throw freebies at you so i've had loads of side experiments going. Any strain specific advice/observations I can pass on i'd be happy to help :-).

I like the SCROG idea, Sounds like a good one too! I've topped a few of them with a variety of success, i'm leaning away from it now. Never properly SCROG'd though, you gonna use a net?

Our grows are very similar in set up, everything is pretty much identical aside from the perlite/soil ratio and # of lights (and the height issue). How many plants are under your 300w Mars?

If you only have 2ft of height you picked a good strain for it. They don't mind growing low and once a bit sturdier they can be pretty beaten by LST.

I've used 24/0 for all my grows due to sheer laziness (and because why the fuck not lol) but just last month switched to 20/4 and I haven't noticed any difference yet tbh. Growth rate matches that of 24/0 so far (weed is the same, chillis seem to prefer it though). The reason I switched was because of my bill, I was running a ton of CFLs and it was adding up. I went LED and cut the hours.

We're definitely all students man - i'm old and still learning! I learn more everytime I get online and read. I learnt more by trying and fucking up though, plant those freebies and fuck them up! You won't regret it!

Please do PM me as it progresses!! I love following a BM grow, especially with new issues/ideas - like low vertical height space and a SCROG :-).",1475280342

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I may have talked to you about this before, but I was keto too before I got pregnant. During the first trimester I lost weight, but I absolutely could not stand eggs, avocados, kale, or anything else I had been eating. I literally survived the first three months on honey graham crackers, Ritz crackers, water, and cream soda. I'm only just now able to even look at lean meats and various protein options without wanting to vom on the spot, and I'm due in January. 



Anyway... All that long winded stuff to say I get the water weight thing. I'm 25 weeks now (I think?) and can still wear all my same pants, though shirts are a little tight around the bump. I drink at least 4 liters of water minimum a day, usually more... I just can't win. I was overweight to start and passed my ""you should only gain 20 pounds"" mark at my last appointment. I've been eating so many blueberries, cucumbers, and yoghurt per my OB because I can stand to look at it... Anyway. Sorry to rant in you. I was thinking about this a lot tonight! ",1475280343

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Just another day at work over with, that's what I thought as my head hit the pillow with some [calming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bosouX_d8Y) music playing. I never was going to get that promotion, but as I thought the day away getting lost in my music, in my mind, I never thought that one bedroom apartment with dark walls lit by a dim street light would be the last I'd ever see of that world.

&amp;nbsp;

Music. Great for just about anything. Going to work, drowning out my coworkers and going to sleep. I had no real preference, I liked lots of music. Classical, Punk Rock, Metal, Violin, Synthwave and a few others too. I just never thought that it would get me this far.

&amp;nbsp;

I still remember some of what went down to this day, the last I checked the clock it was 12:42, I'd just finished seeing how everyone else's lives were better than mine online. Just finished watching mindless late night TV and I felt my self getting heavy. Slowly I drifted off, the cars going by and somebody outside having an argument were then but distant memories as the piano started playing. And all I could think was ""Maybe I'll be better in my next life.""

&amp;nbsp;

""Hey, get up. Get out of my barn."" My head was screaming, thumping and pounding with pain. I slowly opened my eyes to... A man? I bolted upright, tensing from the pain of jolting my head so quickly.

&amp;nbsp;

""Where am I?"" I said with hesitation in my voice. Did this man take me? Is he after money? Goodluck with that pal, you picked the wrong person there. As I ran through these possibilities in my head I realized what he was wearing. At first I held a look that must have been only condescending to that poor old man now and then I caught at look at his face. He looked just as confused as I did.

&amp;nbsp;

""What's that?"" he said pointing at my phone and headphones. At first I had no idea why he wouldn't know what this was, even out in the middle of god only knows where so I got straight back onto track and put my phone in my pocket and hooked my headphones around my neck.

&amp;nbsp;

I was surprised at first. He said he had no idea how I got in his barn and he threatened to call the wardens. Wait, Wardens?

""What do you mean, Wardens? Do you mean the Police? Can you direct me to them, I have no idea how I got here."" I said with a tone of confusion that exceeded even his. I got up off the floor, that's when I pushed my cable out of my audio jack and the [next song](https://youtu.be/4MCjU-Du3eI?t=2m13s) on the playlist started playing out of my phone.

&amp;nbsp;

Oh, I remember that day well. The look on his face, the energy I felt. It was... Well, magical.

""Are... Are you an Angel?"" The old man said while crossing himself. At first I didn't notice it, but I was pulsating. There I stood, in a golden white glow. Yes, me; dressed in all black glowing like a damn lighthouse. The ground it self was shaking and the ground around began blossoming with pure green grass. All I could muster at that point was repeating the question. He just pointed toward the road, shakily told me ""that way"" and ran inside, crossing himself once more. I hooked my headphones back into my phone paused my music and began walking.

&amp;nbsp;

After walking for about what must of been an hour, I arrived in a small town that consisted of no more than maybe fifteen or twenty buildings. This is not what I needed, I needed help and quickly. But I also needed water and something for my... head? My head ache had gone, strange. At that point I could have sworn I had a head ache before I played that music. I proceeded to the local tavern, which was strange considering that I didn't live in a Western. But I just wanted to get home, and I needed help.

&amp;nbsp;

In the tavern, there was pretty much what you'd expect to see in a tavern. Four guys playing something that looked vaguely like poker in the corner nearest the window adjacent to the entrance, some old guys talking about their youth nearest to the bar and a young couple that couldn't be older than twenty, wasted at a table next to a strange looking dart board.

&amp;nbsp;

The bartender had blue eyes and wore a blue dress. It actually looked slightly out of place compared to the rest of the room, it was sparkling slightly and drew attention from the rest of the place.

""Hey, could I get some water please? I don't know how I got here and am looking for some help."" I said as I slumped down onto the bar stool with my phone out, still looking for reception.

&amp;nbsp;

""Lost, huh"" she said handing me some water.

""Yeah, something like that"" I replied, noticing her eyeing my phone up and what I was dressed in. When I thought about it, I was the only one dressed in such a defined colour besides her.

""Who's your tailor mr?"" she eventually worked up the curiosity to ask about these things now.

""Oh, tailor? No I just bought these online."" At this point she looked like an actual dog when they turn their head.

""Anyway, why is it so quiet around here? Could use some music or something."" I thought the room couldn't turn anymore silent then it already was, but apparently I was mistaken. Everybody's head turned towards me and I was saved by a handful of guys walking into the bar. Good, I thought to my self. I put on my [headphones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48dQMECiv48&amp;list=PLGYqQk1XqSFCntij01pRRdOWTPJB3Nuzj&amp;index=53) to think and hit play.

&amp;nbsp;

""Hey, Avilange. It's time to pay up."" They said as if it were legal, normal and not clich√© to go around saying that. I sighed and went back to thinking and drinking my glass of water, totally missing what a strange name Avilange is.

&amp;nbsp;

""Hey mr, you got something you wanna say?"" He barked, ready to pounce. I pulled my headphones out, slightly leaking music and again, all of their faces turned to jaw dropped stone. Then it happened again. The mouthy one ran at me and I didn't want to to fight. A blinding light burst through out the room and they were suddenly pinned to the ceiling.

""Well, I guess that explains a lot."" I muttered, in just as much shock as everyone else.

&amp;nbsp;

""He's in there!"" The familiar voice of the old man at the farm said in shaken fear.

&amp;nbsp;

""They must be the wardens."" I began gently laughing to my self as I pulled the jack from my phone and turned up the volume. [This is going to be quick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFQ3h3o61uI)

First, that Mars will be incapable of bootstrapping their own industrial infrastructure over time, thus requiring them to import all industrial infrastructure from Earth, and secondly, that a Martian computer isn't a computer unless it is identical to the latest and greatest iPhone or Dell laptop.

Earth was able to go from 1920s technology to 2016 technology in less than 100 years, with $0 of extra-terrestrial imports, and we had to discover and invent all that stuff to boot.  Mars will have the advantage of Earth knowledge and our willingness to help them bootstrap their own infrastructure.  We do not need to export a turn-key modern chip fab to Mars.  All we have to do is export the knowledge and tools required to help them get a basic industrial base.

I am curious to know what 'equipment required to keep them alive' can't be made on Mars once Mars has 1920s era tech and industrial base.

I don't know Morg's head-striking power is, but AFAIK no-one ever in the marvel continuum has busted a planet with a head butt.

&gt;Weaker characters than him can do that. Thor shattered the planet he was on and cracked nearby moons with his strikes against Gorr

Just because Thor isn't as versatile and has as good of speed feats and versatility as Silver Surfer certainly doesn't mean he's weaker. Silver Surfer would absolutely destroy Thor 8/10 and *IS* a more powerful person, but he's not stronger. Thor's [lifted a serpent that LITERALLY weighed as much as composite earth] (http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd123/forever_051/TM202.jpg) and has continuously busted planets scores of times, I assume I don't need to show scans since we both know Thor is a casual planet buster haha. 

However I went on the Silver Surfer respect thread just to see if what you're talking about was under energy projection and it [was] (https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/2fpjiq/respect_the_silver_surfer/). Silver Surfer has absolutely no problem busting planets with his energy projection and I'm not claiming that he does, he however does NOT have striking power capable of busting a planet, whether that be with his head or fists.

...Including the adults that had the exact same experiences as you, right? Because one of my best friends dated a lot in high school, definitely lost her virginity somewhere in there. She married a guy at one point that she knew wouldn't work, but her parents had spent so much money on the wedding that she just went through with it, knowing that divorce was going to be in her future. She's been through a few bad relationships.

My point is, people are people. Everyone's experience in life is different. Sometimes you have everything set up for success, and you do in fact succeed. Sometimes, you have everything set up for success, and a lot of things fail. Success in adult relationships isn't tied to what someone does in high school. It can help, but it isn't a given. I was a recluse, and I managed to land myself in a very healthy relationship. My brother dated a lot (and while I'd rather not have known it, I ran across his condoms when helping him clean one day and sort of knew), and he also managed to land in a very happy marriage, with his second child being born less than a month ago. My best friend literally wasn't allowed to date, and she's quite happily married with a child. And my other friend was allowed to date - her parents were awesome, really - and she was divorced less than a year after her wedding. Though right now, I know she's pretty damn happy helping run a farm somewhere in Indiana, and her relationships have been more stable and happy since then.

HG as a brand are all but finished. They need a miracle to get people to trust them again. Sean needs to produce an apology and a full explanation to why the game is exactly like it is. This may or hopefully will appease players to a certain degree but unless they can make the game itself fun for those players who found it boring etc It's unlikely they will ever return to it.

Also HG needs to issue refunds for those requesting them because as far as it goes even if they can update the game to some players satisfaction others will harbour hate for HG and Sean until they get their cash back.

If HG can do this they may survive but time is running out and the longer they leave it the less chance they have of ever selling another game again. ",1475280358

If anything I see the behavior you describe more from fresh graduates (who think they know everything). The first lesson you learn when you start doing research is that you know jack shit and you need to put your ego at the door because you're going to be the dumbest person in the room for the next 5 years. Also, since you are actually working on stuff nobody has worked before, ever (or at least not recorded it, let's be a bit humble), all the class notes you have memorized are not going to save you. 

I'm sure some are complete assholes that think their degree makes them smart (hint: as you probably found out it doesn't, it just mean that they are good at *research*).

&gt; I would hazard a guess that PhDs being ill fitted for their roles doesn't happen any more than any other degree.

You hit the nail on the head with that though, people need to understand that a PhD is just a degree in research. The only reason it requires 8+ years is because you need to have a lot of formal background knowledge about a topic to even start researching it, but if the job doesn't require independent research, then a PhD is as good as any other degree.

I really enjoyed the discussion at the tail end about how to deal with freedom of speech in the digital age. You guys could probably make a topic out of it and talk about it more.  
  
Personally I think we are getting to a point where a individual's right to free speech trumps a company's right to control what happens on their platform. A person is more important than a company, therefore a person's rights are more important than a company's.   
  
This actually reminds me of businesses discriminating based on color in the US south that led to the Civil Rights Act. Yes, a business should be able to refuse service to anyone, but when service is being refused to people on the basis of color, race, religion, etc, that refusal is unfairly limiting the rights of those people, which is why they made it illegal.

Similarity, a company has a right to control what is or is not on its platform, but when those decisions affect people's ability to exercise free speech I would argue that free speech should be protected.  
  
A thought experiment to make my point:  If AT@T had a program that listened to every phone conversation for keywords and ended the call if one of those keywords was uttered, is that not an abrogation of the users free speech?

For the entire first semester, she pretended I didn't exist. On the rare occasions that she would ask if anyone had any questions and I raised my hand, she would skip over me as if I wasn't even a student in her class. She would look around, see only my hand up and be like ""no one? Okay. Let's move on"" and turn around. Some of the other kids were like ""Echo has a question."" She would turn back around and be like ""what was that? No one has a question? Okay."" Then I stood up and just blurted out my question. Then she would still act like I wasn't even a student of hers! God, she was a total bitch. Oh and come second semester, she literally depended on me. I was out for 3 days in the beginning of the first semester because I was at a training to help make the school a better place by implementing technology and giving everyone a personal Microsoft Surface 3 for the year. Mrs. McGahee was afraid of her Surface and didn't know how to turn it on. I was like ""see that button?"" When she nodded I was like ""you press it."" She looked at me and asked ""are you sure that it won't blow up in my face?"" Some of my friends heard this and basically died laughing. She acted like she had absolutely no memory of acting like I didn't exist.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I don't know why you would consider his view point particularly new. This has been the standard line of argument used by the nationalist side when they weren't fear mongering.

It's simply common sense that when a smaller political entity joins a larger political entity, it must give up some of its rights to self-determination. It's also common sense that not every decision made by the larger political body will be in the individual interests of every single smaller entity. Neither of these are inherently bad; the only question, or what should be the only question, is whether these costs of membership outweigh its benefits. In their answer to this question as regards to Brexit, economic and political experts were fairly unequivocal: no.

It's this sense of give and take that the pro-Brexit side intentionally avoided addressing during their campaign, and this MP is not really an exception. You could take his speech and replace *the UK* with *Cornwall*, and *the EU* with *England*, and most of his arguments would still make superficial sense (except for the undemocratic election of European Council members); for almost all of their important political decisions, the Cornish have to appeal through a ""third-party"" in the way of British Parliament, and in most cases wherein their interests are at odds with those of the rest of the country, they're going to be told no and to suck it up; yet Cornwall would be completely retarded to try become an independent nation. Now, this analogy does fall flat at a few points, as England isn't beholden to membership by the threat of military force, nor is the EU as critical to its existence, but the main point is that a lot of the rhetoric these politicians use is intentionally myopic, designed to pluck a few emotional heart strings whilst avoiding a view of the contradicting whole.",1475280366

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","A stock option gives you the right to buy a share of the company's stock.  To actually buy the share you have to exercise the option.  

Most startups put a vesting period on the stock options.  That means that you can only exercise them after the option has vested. The vesting period could be 1 year for all of the options, or they might vest over a period of time.  

For example, if you were granted 100,000 options, 25% of them might vest after your first year at the company, the next 25% after the 2nd year, another 25% after the 3rd year and the last 25% after your 4th year.

The strike price is the price you pay for the shares.  If your strike price was $1, and you wanted to exercise 10,000 options would would pay $10,000 to your company and they would give you 10,000 shares.

Most startups issue stock options with strike prices that are below the current value of the shares (if its a private company the current value might be the share price in the last capital raise).  So if they sold shares to investors at $5, and you have the option to buy shares at $1, you could potentially be making $4 per share just by working at the company.  Of course if the company doesn't do well the shares could be worth nothing.

That's just a basic overview, bottom line: the options won't cost you anything if you never exercise them.  ",1475280366
"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","Strange that the author would omit the fourth candidate, Paul Saint-Pierre Plamondon. Sure he's stuck in last place, but he's been widely praised as one of the most politically savvy new comer to politics.

As far as the race is concerned, obviously it's between Lis√©e and Cloutier. Things began quietly months ago with Cloutier receiving almost unanimous support from party establishment that overshadowed it's policy proposals which remain few and vague to this day. On the other hand, Lis√©e periodically announced a plethora of proposals covering almost all political issues, most famously his rejection of a referendum in a first mandate as part of path of victories.

Regarding the two other candidates, Martine Ouellet oriented her discourse toward independentist orthodoxy and a quick referendum. As she continued to remain low in voting intentions, she began to market herself as the anti establishment candidate and has vigorously chastised Cloutier in the last debate regarding his unwillingness to use the notwithstanding clause. On the other hand, PSPP is a genuinely sympathetic guy that's essentially a Lis√©e clone as far as policies are concerned, yet mostly stresses the importance of giving the PQ back to it's members.

As a PQ member I've followed this race quite closely, have watched all debates and even attended the last one at the Monument National. I'll be voting for Lis√©e seeing as as far as I'm concerned, he clearly is the better campaigner and has shown an attitude more in line with that sought of a statesman. While comfortable as the would be leader in waiting, Cloutier demonstrated that he is of little to no use when debating, becoming an artisan of the langue de bois and showing opportunism before dedication. If anyone is interested, here's Lis√©e [completely derailing Radio-Canada's Michel C.

It's a shame. Europe was doing some great things, marked today by the ESA, but the federalist ideologues just kept pushing past everyone they saw as delaying the inevitable - never pausing to consider whether they were the problem.

Now the inevitability seems shattered as one of the EU's biggest economies is on the point of leaving.  Euro disaffection is growing in many EU countries.

If I accept that my vote can't change the outcome of the election the only reason for voting is for the personal satisfaction of doing so. Isn't it more satisfying to vote for someone you actually agree with.

Additionally I think there are some moral arguments for voting. I also think that if I vote I might be able to convince other people around me to vote and the collective action can matter even if my individual action doesn't.

&gt;
&gt;Yes they beat a cooked west coast
&gt;
&gt;Yes they beat a tired Hawthorn
&gt;
&gt;Yes they beat an inexperienced GWS without Stevie J
&gt;
&gt;And when they beat the swans earlier this year by a kick after the siren after the swans squandered so many shots, they played an outfit that is differant from todays. They had no tippett, no naismith, Sinclair was first ruck, towers was playing and Heeney was missing.
&gt;
&gt;Also at that stage the swans were too buddy focused, it was after this game they pushed buddy more up towards the wings and tweeked their game plan. 
&gt;
&gt;I watched last weeks game against GWS and there was nothing in that game that showed me the dogs will be the real deal, in fact the last 10 mins both teams looked spent. 
&gt;
&gt;All this pressure on the dogs and the inexperience of playing in the big one will be a worry. 
&gt;
&gt;No fairytale has ever eventuated, all of them has seen the sentimental favourite thrashed, thats the reality. People are comparing the dogs ""fairytale"" to 2005 when in reality its 1996. 2005 wasnt a fairytale as the swans had played in one 9 years earlier.
&gt;
&gt;I am sorry to break the MASSIVE bulldog cirklejerk, the biggest i have ever experienced, but lets be real here.
&gt;
&gt;And I hope this will be the last time we see the embarrassing performance by a very amateur Melbourne media. 
&gt;
&gt;By adding a blue ribbon to the side where the swans colours are suppose to be on the cup and then having some has been cry on national tv and declare them winners while raising the cup? Bad form.
&gt;
&gt;Showing a whole night of bulldog specials? Bad form.
&gt;
&gt;I am sure some of the swans players watched this all unfold last night and its given them extra incentive on top of 2014.
&gt;
&gt;They looked really focused yesterday while the dog players with thier sunnies and big smiles look over confident.
&gt;
&gt;I hope this will be a valuable lesson to all.

Subs allow those who don't understand Japanese to watch the show without potential censoring or changes. Dubs reduce the confusion over who is talking, and often give you a better idea of what is actually being said, as the meaning given through tone, inflection, and pace is very different between Japanese and the Romance Languages.",1475280380

He didn't play much last year so everyone called him a bust but it's the way Zimmer does things when he's not forced to put a young player in(Treadwell this year) he has 2 interceptions already. He will grow into an above average corner I think. Same with Mack Alexander. He's played a bit but not enough to truly tell. He's more depth right now. Kearse I think will be a beast. Dude is huge! Other than standing out in the preseason all he's really seen this season is special teams. So again too early to tell. Clemmings gets mixed opinions around here. While he didn't do the best last year he was kind of thrust into the lineup his rookie year. He filled in at LT last week and held his own for the most part. We badly need him to pan out!

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","I think Asia's been pretty consistent that she saw Adnan on 1/13 in the library around 2:20-2:40.

Inez was pretty consistent in her first two statements (as well as being consistent with the correct day) and then changed her statement later in a way that was more aligned with the state's theory.

In her first two statements, Inez said that Hae was going to work that evening, not a wrestling match.  That is consistent with the evidence according to her work schedule, her brother, her work manager, her boyfriend.  They all believed she planned to go to work that night. So I believe that Inez was more accurate in her first two statements than her trial testimony which is not consistent with 1/13.  Her memory of what happened was pretty clear: Hae drove up, she was in a hurry, didn't wait in line, got her stuff, and left.  Inez had a clear view of Hae's car and said she didn't see anyone in it.  I think that's pretty credible.  Later her story has become more contaminated with police theories about the Randallstown match based on the false assumption that the letter to Don found in Hae's car pertained to that day.  I don't know if Inez lied at that point or if her memory was just contaminated.

I think the record is overwhelming that Jay is a pathological liar.  He's pretty unrepentant about it, even saying on the stand that it is up to the police to discover his lies, it's not his job to reveal them.  

We're going to disagree. I don't know what you think the point is of dragging that out. 

The OP is: If not Adnan, then who?  I'm exploring that, not rehashing all the arguments over again as to why I think Adnan is probably not guilty.",1475280389

In the morning, see how your skin feels and you may only need a splash of water on your face to wake you up. But if you're using a AHA it's a good idea to also have a sunscreen in your morning routine.

Some people may use a BHA in the morning and moisturise again. I would recommend this if you don't see improvement of the flaky skin.

Remember to not introduce too many products at the same time, so if you don't cleanse at the moment maybe hold of on the serum and just begin with the moisturiser for a week or so and then introduce the serum, then introduce a cleanser.

"mtgfinance","t5_2vv1m","Good feedback isn't always as it seems, as there are many active sellers on ebay &amp; Amazon marketplace with high number, high percentage positive feedback who sell nothing but counterfeit items, such as bootleg DVDs of TV show complete seasons &amp; series, at a steep discount from retail. Most people don't realize they got a counterfeit item and leave positive feedback, while those who do realize it &amp; contact the seller are immediately given a full refund, and the seller continues on without any public evidence that they're selling counterfeit items. That seems to be the case here, since as it says in [the article](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/traderous-instinct-go-down-gambling/) that has the analysis of the listing from the high feedback seller, slotcarboss, that he sold slot car related items &amp; clothes, and googling the username turned up a [thread on a slot car forum](http://slotblog.net/topic/20335-fake-difalco-controllers-on-ebay/) about the guy selling counterfeit controllers on ebay.

Hypothesis: The visual distortion shown is a digital artifact created by bumping the camera.

Experiment: Replicate the setup used by the original videographer and subtly bump the recording camera with varying zoom levels, then sump the camera with varying amounts of force. Examine the recording for visually similar phenomenon.

Second Experiment: Replicate the original setup, but twice. Record the moon from two different locations several feet apart so bumping one camera wouldn't bump the other. See if you observe a similar distortion, but one that only occurs in one of the cameras.

Both would support the digital artifact hypothesis if they produced positive results. If the second experiment found distortions both cameras, it would be evidence against the digital artifact hypothesis.",1475280396

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt; Its probably in his top 5 telepathy offence feats, considering Larfleeze, Atrocitus and Ganthet are in the mix.

I disagree. But whatever, not really that important of a point.

&gt; Why not? Show me a TP defence feat proving Hal could resist a BL'd MMH full-on mindrape.

Okay. Here's him breaking a [nightmare](http://i.imgur.com/YCsGtFM.jpg) that MMH couldn't break out of.

There's also lots of instances of him resisting/straight up denying the control of Parallax, who is at the very *least* a universal entity, and has many a time been portrayed as a multiversal one.

Which would trump MMH TP.

&gt; That's dumb. There's literally no reason to assume his TP is in any way amped. Like, if we had a scan of Batman outthinking Superman while he was wearing a special suit, you couldn't just dismiss the feat because Batman wearing that suit isn't standard Batman. It wouldn't affect his intelligence, just like the BL ring doesn't affect MMHs telepathy.

It's not standard MMH, it can't be used. That's not a new concept, that's just a rule. 

I'm not going to argue that point.

&gt; This one? Thats Hal, and its just a character statement (from someone whos known for being pretty cocky)

As Hal is explaining it, the fight is happening because that guy (tom) was using his ring and protecting that kid. Pretty sure that's what happened, but correct me if I'm wrong. It's been awhile.

&gt; Tbf your scan is quite a bit older. Idk the exact issue but I'd guess early PC, which means probably more than 30 years old.

It's late 80s I believe. So yeah, around 30 years old. But it's just as canon as the one you provided.

&gt; So you're saying that in everything he does, Hal is constantly giving it 110 of his effort and energy? Not impossible, but it seems like a dumb thing to assume.

I'm saying that there's never a point where Hal *can't* dish out a full willpower blast unless there's some kind of extreme situation, like his girlfriend just died or something. But usually he gets over things like that pretty quickly.

&gt; Bad comparison. The speedforce is an external thing, Hal's willpower comes just from him.

Willpower is also an ""external thing"" technically, because it all comes from Ion and/or the GL Central Power Battery.

&gt; Hal could probably blast a big hole through MMH's chest, but I doubt he could completely atomize him. I don't think he has any ""atomizing S-Tier level opponents"" feats

You're right, he doesn't atomize opponents very often so I don't can't think of a feat where he does so against an S-Tier. However, the blasts that he *does* shoot have been able to significantly damage and sometimes even defeat enemies that are *far* above S-tier. 

And while I know that MMH doesn't have his fire weakness any more, or at least it's much more subdued now, a blast as [hot as the sun](http://i.imgur.com/Pe7wp3X.jpg) should definitely do the trick.

&gt; That's not how burden of proof works. You have to prove it does amp existing powers before I have to prove that it doesn't.

That's not correct at all. 

That isn't standard MMH. Standard MMH is the one in this fight. You can't use a completely different character unless **you** can prove that Black Lantern MMH wasn't changed at all by the addition of a BL Ring.

Ask a mod, if you would like. But it's very clear that using feats from a non-standard version of a character isn't allowed.

&gt; Yes, they give you additional powers, but they don't amp existing ones. Like, theres no reason to assume Superman's heat vision becomes hotter when he wears a Lantern ring.

Yes there is. Amping strength, speed, etc *is* amping existing powers. Mind control abilities which are attributed to his physiology would fall right into that same category.

&gt; You think a BL'd Hal would be able to do something instantly on his own that John Stewart needed a days prep and the Guardian's help to do? Keep in mind, getting help from the Guardians of the Universe is a pretty big thing. Those guys are around skyfather level.

And Hal has defeated arguably the most powerful of them, who is universal+/possibly multiversal.

&gt; Yeah, Hal has better feats than John, but not so much so that he could instantly resist MMH's telepathy without the days prep or help from Guardians that John needed. They'd be in completely seperate tiers if that was the case, but they're both just S-Tier.

MMH is also just an S-Tier, so I don't see your point.

&gt; MMH would probably be fast enough to punch Hal a million times over before Hal could react and blast back.

No he wouldn't. Hal has comparable combat speed. And any gap in reaction time would be supplemented by the rings auto function.

&gt; And considering how hard MMH hits, that should be enough to KO Hal.

Hal has tanked worse.

&gt; I don't think it'd KO him, considering his malleability. It might mess his face up, but he'd just regen then attack telepathically.

MMH has been put down by physical attacks before. And again, this is all going to happen thousands of times before MMH can even think.

&gt; It might be harder to steal the speed of an FTL S-Tier than the speed of an explosion or a guillotine.

Nah. He's stolen the energy of an entire exploding planet before, and has specifically noted that he could steal Supes' speed midrun.

&gt; It's unlikely Flash will be doing it in a nanosecond or two, based on the feats. Any longer than that and MMH will react.

He has more than a couple of nanoseconds.

However! There may be hope! Or tragedy; I'm paranoid. I've been googling half the morning whether it's possible to feel this much better this early and everything still be okay. Nausea was light but manageable for weeks 5-6 but hit me hard about 6w+5. That's the last time I ate vegetables or coffee or many of my other favourite things. Terrible, I know.

I didn't want to eat anything. Everything made me gag or dry heave or just want to cry. I would force myself to consume some small bit of the least offensive thing I could think of (usually like a croissant) almost hourly and that seemed to help, even though it was horrible choking it down.

Until 8+5. Suddenly, I didn't totally hate the idea of food. What I wanted to eat was still a narrow, narrow range, but it was better than hating all the things. 

Now I'm 9+5 and it's eased up and eased up this week. I also had the week off work and have slept TONS so I don't know if that's helping but I am finding more and more things tolerable. Food doesn't excite me, but I haven't gagged or heaved hardly at all in a week and don't actually feel nauseous at all right now. It's a beautiful thing. I might even make dinner tonight. üòÇ

A weird paragraph after 60 pages of a great script is not going to make ANY executive blink, they'll just give a note asking what the deal was, same as Weinstein did, assuming that he missed hints that the professors were gay, or that it was a mis-edit from a previous version of the script. 

With the amount of stuff that is excised out of an average script, that's nothing. You also underestimate the stomach of your average executive. ",1475280404

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I don't see your point. Those incidents are nothing compared to the past and even more impressive if you look at global numbers.

[Here you go.](http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-07/we-terrorism-1970-2015final.png)

Until the 90s, we had hundreds of deaths due to terrorism every year. Nowadays... practically nothing with a few freak incidents.

[Here is the list with information on individual countries.](https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_4093_people_killed_by_terrorist_attacks_in_western_europe_since_1970_n.jpg)


And that's despite [constantly rising global amounts of terrorism](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/11/blogs/graphic-detail/20151121_woc539.png)

Although one always needs to note that terrorism is an almost completely negligible problem in the West and that being affected by terrorism is about as likely as being hit by lightning.

We have FAR worse problems that one should vote left wing extremist for. For example environmental pollution. Air pollution alone kills more people every year than all wars, terrorism and violent crime combined. If only right wing nutjobs would care about human life instead of emotions and being xenophobic racists, we would live in a much better world. 

But minor problems that kill a few hundred people at maximum require drastic and completely over-the-top measures, destroying our freedoms and human rights and condemning countless of brown people to suffering... because Muslims are scary.   

In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of Europeans die preventable deaths every single year due to the use of fossil fuels and lack of investments in renewables but the right wingers don't give a shit.

In the meantime, the meat industry is overusing antibiotics leading to the spread of super-resistant microbes that are projected to kill millions of people every year in the future and the right wingers don't give a shit. 

No. Right wingers care about brown people coming to their country with their different culture. That's scary. Not the hundreds of thousands of deaths due to air pollution and multi-resistant bacteria. Those aren't scary. No. Islam is scary.

When it comes to the economic cost and cost to human life, every fucking flu season should cause more outrage than terrorism. Hell, the war on terrorism and the violation of our human rights as a consequence should be more outrageous to them than terrorism itself. But nope, they don't give a shit. They are scare of foreigners with weird accents and different religions. THAT'S important to these nutjobs.

And the worst part? They don't even know any of this. Because they don't inform themselves. They are adults with the right to vote and access to the internet... but they refuse to educate themselves. The irresponsibility, the apathy and the ignorance. That is the worst part, my friend.",1475280406

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The game gimps you if you play in online mode and ever want to play in offline mode again. Everything you earn in online mode cannot be transferred to offline mode in terms of money. On top of that, I would say that the economy of the game, the prices for things and timers, are all very balanced towards online mode. It seems to me it would be frustrating to make enough money playing the game exclusively in offline mode. In addition to that, certain things like the side ops are very frustrating at times. 

The game is universally agreed to be unfinished, and very weak on story to outright lacking an actual story. It's not just a weak story for Metal Gear Solid, it's a weak story in general for story based video games. 

The gameplay is tight, but heavily skewed towards action above stealth. In addition to that, there's only 2 types of missions and only 2 settings. Without real plot direction you're going to have to be in love with those 2 missions and backdrops or end up feeling like you've done the same thing time and time again.

Going back to the economy, balance, and timers, generally speaking there's little reason to upgrade some of your gear. You can beat the game using pretty much the same 3 weapons rendering almost everything else totally arbitrary. The gameplay is tight but the AI is shit. Not just shit compared to what was promised, it's just weak. It's Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 levels of weak. It makes the game even easier, and sometimes makes the game just really silly in an unintentional way. There are countless ways to break the game actually, which is not great balance. But on top of that by the time you do get fully upgraded stuff you're probably at the end of the game or have beaten the game anyways so again, either in love with the game or you don't have the interest to be a completionist about it. 

Often times things are not as clear as they maybe should be, which you'll find when developing and equipping weapons. There are countless disappointments like the completely nonlethal laser sword on the D-walker. Many weapons are just impractical. And not in a functional but uneeded way. In a you really have to go out of your way to mess up just so you can use it way. Examples of not being clear would include the skins you can unlock for characters as well. They do things, but you don't always understand just what the hell they do. 

Some of the boss fights were just not fun in my opinion. And MGS has always been one of those games that excelled at new and interesting boss fights. In this game I found myself annoyed by every single one of them.

That's just SOME of the problems I have with the game. I say all of that together definitely warrants a 7. It's not even the first game to let you go into an enemy stronghold with stealth and complete objectives. Shadow of Mordor exists. 

I actually feel like mentioning two points I was really, really upset with the game. One was the virus which decimated my people. I was suddenly caught off guard in a very negative way and forced to undergo some very stupid missions to stop it, and rush the story hard. Also the base raiding I found to be very poorely balanced and not a fun experience to be on either end of. ",1475280409

"BattleRite","t5_3cpt0","I'm fairly confident it doesn't affect your rating at all, except maybe the fact that it'll now match you with players out of placements. Normally, your rating is hidden and you're ""in placements"" until you fill in all the bubbles at grade 5. This is so the system has a minimum sample size to work with before showing you where it thinks you're at, hiding the huge swings in rating early on. You still gain/lose 900+ rating (as other posters have noted) while you're in placements, it just normally isn't shown to you. AI games count towards this progress (which is a bug) but all that's really happened is your high uncertainty placement rating is now 
shown. 

&amp;nbsp;

Your 470 mmr could be actually something like 2000 hidden rating (mean) and 510 deviation. Since the formula is

    displayed rating = mean - 3 * deviation

you'd end up with

    2000 - 3 * 510 = 470

&amp;nbsp;

All this means is that the system still has no clue where to place you and the uncertainty range is huge. TrueSkill gives an extremely conservative estimate of your rating, and what's shown to you is actually a 99% confidence interval.

&amp;nbsp;

In the above example, this means that the system is at least 99% sure you're at least a 470 mmr player, and 50% sure you're at least a 2000 mmr player. Huge range, right? That's why placements exist - to hide this huge range and give the system a chance to narrow it down before showing you anything. If they removed the ""in placements"" feature you'd see exactly what you're seeing now after playing bot games for all of your placements.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: it's a visual bug which may affect your matchmaking slightly, but playing bot games has no effect on your actual rating.",1475280409

*****
&gt; In a six-year study following 1,000 college students, researchers found that the more non-alcoholic energy drinks a person reported throwing back, the more likely they were to drive drunk.

&gt; The researchers speculate that drinking energy drinks prior to or alongside alcoholic ones may allow a drinker to become &amp;quot;Wide-awake drunk,&amp;quot; paving the way for more drinking and risky behavior such as drunk driving.

&gt; The authors also suggest psychosocial factors that may explain the data; the type of people who drink energy drinks may be the type already prone to driving drunk-or at least admitting to it in a study.

1) You must always have your bro‚Äôs back. No exceptions.

2) When your bro‚Äôs girlfriend inquires about his whereabouts you know nothing, always.

3) You are only obligated to wingman for one bro per social event, after that the bro is on his own.

4) When a bro designates you as his wingman, you may not fail him. This is the most important role a bro may play for a bro, and may not be violated or debauched.

5) You must always do whatever is in your power to stop a bro from soiling himself with a poor looking girl. Unless the bro is able to stand up, look you in the eye, and articulate that he is to a decent extent sober. Then you are absolved of any responsibility.

But once we all hit level 20, and had full item builds the tide gradually turned. The enemy team just was not as good in team fights. We eventually won even though the enemy had double the number of kills, something like 30 to 60 in their favor. 

The reverse experience was a similarly hard fought match that stopped for everyone (not just a single DC) literally a fraction of a second before I took out the titan. I was at the top of a Bellona ult leap onto their titan and the match died. ",1475280415

However, I don't have very much experience with receivers (read: no experience). That is why I am asking here! My current audio system comprises of the following.

* Sub: Polk PSW10
* Speakers: Micca COVO-S _(obviously needing an upgrade here, eyeing ELAC UB5)_
* Amp: SMSL SA-36A
* DAC: Schiit Bifrost, using Schiit Asgard 2 as a preamp

Also of note, being able to control the system (inputs, volume, etc.) through a remote is ideal.

*****
&gt; In a six-year study following 1,000 college students, researchers found that the more non-alcoholic energy drinks a person reported throwing back, the more likely they were to drive drunk.

&gt; The researchers speculate that drinking energy drinks prior to or alongside alcoholic ones may allow a drinker to become &amp;quot;Wide-awake drunk,&amp;quot; paving the way for more drinking and risky behavior such as drunk driving.

&gt; The authors also suggest psychosocial factors that may explain the data; the type of people who drink energy drinks may be the type already prone to driving drunk-or at least admitting to it in a study.

To me, and this personal outside of wicca, eating vegetarian/vegan (which I did look into) is too expensive and it's very easy to make yourself sick if you aren't careful with making sure you get enough protein and such. It's not a good choice for my lifestyle. So if you would like to be vegetarian or vegan, do so, please do a little research first and maybe get a doctor's opinion if you are unsure. That, of course, is just my two cents. ",1475280417

I think I can manage a bit, and Medea w/ RB really works well when you don't put her on a frontline. And I thank the lords for having my support a Tamamo. Her NP really helped 80% of the battle. As for Iri, I'm not sure how to use her that much, so she was only on my backlines. Despite her NP being almost a safeguard like Tamamo's, I pity her because of low attack, so that's one downside in using Iri.

"math","t5_2qh0n","I know a little about the values of zeta functions but not a lot. My impression of the connection that you mention is that it is very interesting and probably generalizes but the generalization is probably not known. 

Actually, what I think is happening is that this is related to explicit class field theory. I will try and explain what this means but if you know class field theory, you can skip to the next paragraph:

Abelian extensions of number fields are Galois extensions that have abelian galois groups. Class field theory is the general theory of what abelian extensions of number fields look like. For instance, any abelian extension of Q is a cyclotomic extension.

It turns out that in general, you cannot so explicitly describe the abelian extensions but in some cases you can. You can do this in particular in the case of gaussian integers and the abelian extensions correspond to torsion points on an elliptic curve (similar to how cyclotomic extensions are generated by the torsion points of the circle).

The arc length of a leminiscate is given by an elliptic integral which is closely related to elliptic curves and I think this is the connection you are seeing.

However, I don't know how one would get from abelian extensions to explicit evaluations of the zeta function... I think this would be an excellent question on mathoverflow (With some formatting) and is likely to produce better answers on that site than on here.

I will also likely ask my advisor this question on monday, I will let you know how he responds.",1475280422

You also can't discount the fact that Tom could still be on her mind, despite her instance that he's not.

""John Lennon beat his wives"" ""Give peace a chance my ass"" etc etc when a minute amount of research will prove this to be false. He had a fucked up upbringing and did some shitty things as a very young man but the last violent encounter he ever got into was at Paul's 21st in 1963. Imagine came out in 1971 when he was a completely different person. I'd rather believe John Lennon's 2 wives who both say he wasn't physically abusive (aside from that one incident with cynthia) than some edgy fucker on reddit who hasn't done a moments research into his claim. John Lennon addressed the error in his past ways and was a different person for the last 17 years of his life but I guess rehabilitation isn't an option for redditors. They'd rather get their kicks trying to falsely ruin the reputation of a guy who is no longer here to defend himself.

Read the Sticky (url also on the sidebar -&gt; ).... Its for sliders but there is good info in there for the vast majority of turtles. You just have to keep in mind that Mud/Musk are mostly poor swimmers, insectivores, need a slightly different style of basking area (no dock) that allows their upper shell to be exposed while their limbs/head are still under water, a 75watt Zoomed Powersun is all you need (if your house gets cold in the winters, buy the 100watt.). The reeves is pretty much the same care as a Slider, except they are poor swimmers and really good at drowning as hatchlings, and you can house them on the same specs as a male Slider, but shallower water.

He went to a mid level school before transferring to Wharton. He didn't fit in with his classmates at Wharton. Upon graduation he began his career as a disappointing stay as a rent collector for his dad where he dealt with brutes(read typical new yorkers) who would get violent when they wanted rent. Trump ended up getting a loan from his dad and fleeing to Manhattan. In Manhattan he got shunned by high society for being a ""relatively poor"" punk from Queens.

"detroitlions","t5_2rynx","We're just getting to know Dwayne Washinton. He runs hard and performed well in limited snaps last week. He had a history of fumbling, obviously, so we have to be a little cautious in our optimism.

Eric Ebron is winning over the fan base. He'll never live up to his draft stock, but from a pragmatic view point, he's become a major contributor and is one of our best receivers, especially downfield. He's fast, strong, and athletic. His drop issues seem to improve every year.

Taylor Decker has been surprisingly solid as a rookie LT, and a big part of our OLs growth this year. He struggles at times, especially in pass protection against more veteran pass rushers, but still, overall positive grades.

Laken Tomlinsin, on the other hand, has been a bit of a disaster. While he has shown a few flashes here and there, he wipes the value from those with some mind numbingly bad plays. He's the weak link on the OL and has some pressure from a couple rookies if he continues to play so inconsistently. 

A'shawn Robinson has been, okay. He hasn't been that noticeable to be honest. He's sharing time with a deep rotation at DT. Hopefully he'll emerge more as the year goes on.

Devin Taylor was supposed to be a breakout player for us this year, but so far hasn't done much. He's been a little banged up, which is likely contributing to the poor showing. Hopefully he gets healthy because he was excellent as a rotational DE last year.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

It's normal to want to do things for people to want to feel secure in a relationship. There's a difference between wanting *security* and wanting *control*. I think we're all a bit to well acquainted with the control aspect, so we might forget about security. Security comes from knowing that you make someone happy- that you improve their life by being a part of it, and that they do the same for you. That's why gift-giving can be so affirming.

It started out innocent enough (I'm not that great looking but I'm blond, small town etc)   I expressed to my manager he creeped me out but she told me I was over reacting. It slowly got worse and he was leaving love notes. We have state troopers and sheriff deputies come in often and I told one about it because they guy had been sitting in the parking lot for 3 hours and followed me while doing trash. So he spoke to him and explained I was uncomfortable and married. My husband was getting pissed at this point because it had gone beyond flirting and into I full anxiety  

So creeper still continues his bs. I finally told my manager enough was enough. We can't bring weapons into the building but I told her I had it in my car and would call the sheriff to escort me home after my shifts (we left at 2am) I didn't live far from home and he figured out quick where I live. I escalated it to corporate after he followed me home with the escort. I had him trespassed from my house and they explained I carry and I wasn't afraid of him. Finally corporate stepped in but only after showing them police reports, love notes and footage of him parking across the street and waiting. 

They trespassed him and my manager got in trouble for not taking me more serious when I obviously had a real problem. 

That got way long so Tdlr had a creeper follow me home, manager did nothing, corporate finally trespassed him after he escalated way beyond it should have gotten. Advice tell your manager, try and get a picture of him and call police. Don't let it go to the point it did!!",1475280434

*****
&gt; Radio communication and incident reports obtained by the Channel 4 I-Team show the closest fire department to a stretch of interstate frequently used by Nashvillians traveling to Chattanooga is refusing to respond to car fires on 1-24 in Marion County on Monteagle Mountain.

&gt; The I-Team also found two other instances of the Battle Creek Fire Department refusing calls, including a tractor trailer on fire on Feb. 4 and a report of a truck&amp;#039;s tires on fire on May 10.

&gt; Haggard also said his budget does not allow him to respond to fire calls on the interstate.

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","My fondest memory of it is probably the long nights of me and my sister waiting in my mother's hospital room during her kidney failure incident, playing board games together. We brought dozens of different games every night, and sometimes my mother every had enough strength to play too. It helped keep us all in good spirits and ensure that we didn't get bored, which always feels awkward when you're in a hospital.

Also, on a more cheerful note, on our first date my boyfriend took me to this beautiful Smithsonian building with a glass roof, and we played half a dozen rounds of Star Realms and had Indian food. It was actually very fairytale, since he knew these were my favourite things.

And just last night, an employee at my local gaming store asked me and the few friends I was playing with if we could entertain two newbies to the hobby. I broke out my personal copy of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and *man*, playing it with first timers is fun. The accusations flew wild, we mixed up the roles multiple times, more people joined, and before we knew it we were apparently being so loud we were causing a minor noise disturbance. Whoops. But I regret nothing.

As for parties, I'm definitely getting together lots of creepy games for a Halloween party with friends. Possibly both a little private one and the local game shop one. My best game for that is Betrayal at House on the Hill, a shifting, twisting game that includes over *fifty* totally randomized horror plots, and you don't know which one is going to happen til half way in. You keep exploring the house, then suddenly... one of the players is actually trying to sacrifice you to demons! Or they're secretly a jigsaw-style serial killer! Or you've been trapped in a parallel dimension and the atmosphere is slowly killing you if you don't get the machine working again and return to reality! I always like to look at it as Cabin In The Woods: The Board Game, if you've ever seen it - the horror plot chosen is even based on the last thing a character touched, a direct parallel to the movie.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","I'm giving my standard boilerplate response to this:

In a free market(i) the current income inequality will NEVER EVER happen. Why? Because a free market maximizes efficiency, and **it is not efficient for five people to own as much as 150 million people**. Capital is far more efficiently managed by 150 million individual owners, than five owners.

Free-market inhibiting factors that could be contributing to income disparity:

* high fixed-costs for participating in business. Fixed costs, unlike variable costs, punish small businesses. Regulations are known in the economics field as a source of fixed costs. A very basic example: you can't offer stock in your company on a stock exchange without having millions of dollars to pay lawyers. This excludes millions of small businesses from one of the best sources of capital: the public stock market. More on regulations causing an upward distribution of income: [Working Paper: The Upward Redistribution of Income: Are Rents the Story?](http://cepr.net/publications/reports/working-paper-the-upward-redistribution-of-income-are-rents-the-story)

* high market transaction costs as a result of regulations and taxes. Why do high market transaction costs contribute to income disparity? Because non-market transactions internal to an organization are not subject to the costs imposed by regulations and taxes. This will result in large corporations having a competitive advantage over small ones that rely on market transactions for a greater portion of their activity. For example, a large corporation doesn't need to pay a sales tax to have its accounting department do an accounting job for it. A small corporation that pays an external company to do it does.


The socialist response to the growing income inequality is not the right one. The real solution is to find where the government is imposing regulatory costs that disproportionately harm lower income groups, and/or not fulfilling its responsibility to prevent private capture of public utilities.

(i) *A free market does not mean 'no government'. It means a market where private parties are protected in their property rights, without being restricted in their market rights, by the government. A free market does not preclude, and in fact arguably requires, government regulation of or direct government provision of public utilities like water, electricity, etc.*

No, I was originally arguing against the idea that the young lads who did this crime weren't English. They are.

If you then want to drop it into an argument of ethnicity, then fine, but their nationality (and how they would refer to themselves) is British or English.

&gt;you have zero right to demand they also renounce that and accept that their group has no meaning other than ""being born in the UK"".

I fail to see where I have demanded anything of anyone, other than not turning the idea of English ethnicity into some sort of rating system where they stand higher than simply English nationals. That isn't and shouldn't be how a country works. Beyond that I literally don't care what nationality or ethnicity you claim, provided you aren't hurting anyone in the process.

&gt;And by all definitions that i took my time to explain above and haven't yet seen an argument against any of them, a Pakistani practicing muslim with a muslim name and a different skin colour can not be classified as part of the English ethnicity.

Right but nobody who replies ""I'm English"" to the question ""Where are you from?"" is referring to their ethnicity. They're referring to their nationality.

&gt; I have no interrest in this purely philosophical debate

And I have no interest in this largely useless debate. Of course ethnicity exists but at no point have I tried to argue that it doesn't.

All I've argued is against your point:

&gt;He didn't say British though, he said English. Which is a historic and indigenous European ethnicity. Which they aren't. 

Because they are English by nationality. You can say they're not English by ethnicity but I can say that largely hasn't any real bearing anymore, majority of people don't think of ethnicity but nationality when told someone is English.",1475280437

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Once I encountered this woman on the bus who was talking loudly and incessantly at everyone in her radius. It was manic, incomprehensible, stream-of-consciousness type stuff, nothing conversational or even really possible to respond to. She wasn't being mean or profane or anything, but she was clearly struggling with something and none of the rest of us wanted to have to deal with it. Even when one of us did try answering her she'd just continue talking at you and not acknowledge that you even said anything. Eventually the people around her would get up and move to another seat, or even get off the bus entirely. She cleared out all the seats around her before too long. 

Then, at one of the stops this guy gets on the bus and takes a slow look around. Being that the only open seats left were around this lady, he naturally starts moving toward her. You could feel everyone watching and thinking ""poor bastard, don't sit there"" and probably giving him raised eyebrows and warning looks, but of course he sat down pretty much right next to her, and she started jabbering at him immediately. 

He didn't seem to care at all, but it wasn't like he was awkwardly ignoring her like the rest of us. The guy was totally relaxed. He just really didn't notice her. When he finally did, he grinned a big grin and motioned something to the woman with his hands. Apparently the guy was deaf. 

The woman didn't understand at first and kept talking at him, so this guy took out a notepad, wrote something on it, and handed it to her. At that she went quiet and stared at it for a minute. Then she took the notepad and read it, and started rummaging through her bags. She came up with a pen, wrote something on the notepad, and handed it back to the guy. Then she sat there in total attention while he read it. He smiled again, wrote something else, and then handed it back to her. 

The whole rest of the ride went like this. Total silence while these two passed the notepad back and forth, neither speaking, while the rest of us watched, relieved and a little bit amazed.",1475280439

Your o.p. read like a well-meaning newbie asking about doing something for a family business and you mentioned the health industry, which has safety of life and privacy issues, even if it's just for records and email(ish) things.

Rolling your own solution for that to me is unwise.  Find a way to budget for the money, even if you only lease 'real' computers or have to do some kind of phased rollout over a number of years.

If you're an IT person who has delivered pi-based solutions you already know the answers to the questions you asked.   That said, I'd be very wary of a roll-your-own solution for the problem space you mentioned, all it takes is one typo on a prescription and somebody gets the wrong dosage, which has real risk.  Same if their records are stolen or hacked, which has happened to huge medical institutions with many millions/year of revenue.

Buy or lease real computers even if they're just PCs running a web browser in kiosk mode and net-booting.  Buy real software from somebody who does the medical industry as their core business.

Tebow won the playoff game in Pittsburgh, which made Denver more attractive to Peyton. Peyton came to Denver, and with John Elway as GM, launched an AFC West (and currently league-wide) reign of terror that's still going on 5 years later...

Some time later I got a crush on other hot classmate. I had lots of fantasies literally sucking him off and him fucking me while I was sat over his big dick and thighs. 

I was also obsessed with my high school actual bully, when he unintentionally rubbed his package over my face. He wasn't even aware and touched myself accidentally while passing by. For him it was just a second of his life, but for me it was an incredibly appealing object of desire. After this, I used to think back then about me sucking him off and having  his thick big dick getting fatter in my mouth.

I would even say that when I was 10 more or less, I first felt real attraction to male bodies. I was just taking a look to a WWE magazine and I remember myself enjoying seeing the male pictures. I mean, I was like sort of attracted to Randy Orton, Batista, Chris Masters or Johnny Nitro, rather than to Melina, Torrie Wilson or Candice Michelle. I didn't know yet what it was though.

"fireemblemcasual","t5_342g7","**Madoka Magica**

This is sort of like the ""true"" start to Madoka Magica. We're done playing around now. This is a heavy show and it's about to hit hard. 

One thing that I think this show does well is that in those first three episodes it really hammers home how completely unprepared for this Madoka is. In just about every way Madoka is the idealized ""normal"" girl. She has good parents and a healthy relationship with her family. It's hard to tell because of the artistic direction of the show and we don't see other families and their homes really, but her family seems to be at least decently wealthy. 

It's also brought up that Madoka has never really experienced any real suffering of any kind. She has a very good life, and now that's starting to change dramatically, and very quickly. Mami's death hits her like a truck, and then it just keeps going from there. In her talk with Homura she learns a lot more about how twisted the fate of magical girls is, and then right after that she finds out that Sayaka has made the contract. She also very nearly loses Hitomi due to a witch attack. Hell, she would've died herself if Sayaka didn't show up.

Right now she has to be terrified for Sayaka, and then sure enough right at the end of the episode we're introduced to Kyoko who's already going to try to take her out. Being Meduka is suffering.

[Madoka Magica FUTURE EPISODE SPOILERS](#s ""One thing I took away from Homura's talk with Madoka: When Homura said that she had seen other magical girls die like Mami countless times‚Ä¶ holy shit she was talking about Madoka."")

"programming","t5_2fwo","I think the two main differences are: 

* Elm is a language; React is a framework (though with JSX, you could argue React also comprises a language). However, since the language has evolved with web UI in mind, it feels almost like a framework. Accordingly, you may have to make a few more decisions in Elm, but refactoring is so straightforward that I think there's often less friction  in designing certain parts of your app (routes for example) in Elm than choosing between all your options for react (as well as rolling your own).

* Elm is fundamentally more opinionated and strict with data than React (or JS in general). There's only one place you can keep state and update it, so you don't really have the option to mess it up too much. Additionally, all data is immutable. In react, you can keep your state in individual components, a single state object using something like redux (again, copied from elm), or you can do both.",1475280448

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies Sandwiches, Subs, Hotdogs, and even Calzones. I am telling you, specifically, in hotdoggology, no one calls hotdogs sandwiches. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying ""hotdog family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of HotDoggodaemous, which includes things from the hotdog family from mustard to buns.
So your reasoning for calling a hotdog a sandwich  is because it has meat and bread?  Let's get calzones and tacos in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A hotdog is a hotdog and a member of the hotdoggo family. But that's not what you said. You said a hotdog is a sandwich, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the sandwich family hotdogs, which means you'd call subs, and other types of sandwiches hotdogs, too. Which you said you don't.

The types that knew it wasn't about the buzz anymore, but scared of facing the withdrawals. Nothing's worse to an opiate addict than that gut-wrenching, sweat inducing feeling of facing the pure hell one goes through to come out on the other side. I had been there, done that, and was able to sympathize with those wanting to kick that lifestyle.

Even though I had been clean for several years, I still didn't care to try and offer advice to people that genuinely wanted it (time to time, I still do on another account), but it's hard to help others when they're not looking for it or wanting to hear it to begin with. Many, like on /r/drugs and /r/opiates, have the *""hahahaha I'm not addicted, I can quit when I want""* or the *""yeah I know I'm an addict, one life, my life, who cares, live it up""* attitudes, sadly.

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","Gather round kids, it's story time.

Back in my senior year of highschool, I was a legit dumbass. I fucked up Chemistry and Mathematics badly and my other subjects got average grades at best (C's). Always studied, always failed Chem and Math. I just had no aptitude for it. Even got a tutor, but the best she could do was help me catch up with concepts and topics that the rest of my class was already months ahead in. It was degrading and embarrassing to say the least cause my closest friends were casually sliiiiiding through them subjects. They were straight up Steph Currying the sciences. 

My report card always left my mum with a lifeless look in her eyes. The more I failed, the more I lost interest in even trying. I even stopped attending the tutor altogether. I was fucking up, I lost confidence and I constantly felt sorry for myself. 

One thing that always surprised me was how my English and Literature grades were always steadily rising, going from C's to B's. Not spectacular marks, but for a total paste eating dumbass like me, you gotta understand that those marks always made me feel good. 

Also, my teacher was a dope ass dude, who was always so calm and understanding. He always gave us random ungraded pop quizzes to keep us sharp and he never talked down at us when we got stuff wrong. He told us the purpose of the quizzes wasn't to pass, but help us detect mistakes so that each next pop quiz we improve that much more. It made me feel relieved, and built my confident.


So come exams, I went full Rambo on English and Lit., I read a fuckton of novels, analysed the shit out of them, my friends and I tested each other in Chem and Math and it really helped get my head in the game. I was going full beast mode this time. 

When results came in, guess what my scores were? A ""D"" in Chemistry and a ""C"" in Math...I have to admit that I was genuinely disappointed, but in a good way. Like I knew I could have done better, like I *really* could have done better, and that was positive to me because I was finally starting to believe that I did indeed have that potential, what I am capable of. I didn't flunk them, and that to me, was a good sign. But it was kinda bittersweet, cause if it wasn't my last year, I knew I could have done very well on those subjects. Oh well. So i went onto my other results. Every other subject were fairly passable. As for Eng and Lit. My jaw dropped...

I had scored the second highest marks in my whole year with ""A*"" grades. They had basically boosted my final grade to a ""B"". And for the first time ever, I felt ready to show my mum my report card, although a little bit hesitant. 

Her face beamed with pride I had never seen in a long time. It's almost as if she didn't give a fuck about my chem grades or anything other than those few ""A*'s"" that caught her attention. She cried.

Moral of the story: If you suck ass at one thing, that's ok. That means you gotta be *that* much better at what you *are* good at.",1475280464

"DotA2","t5_2s580","For those of you asking where I learned to do this:

&gt; Lua:
&gt;I've had many years experience with lua. I would say about 5, but this is unprofessional experience learned through my hobby of modding.
&gt;There are many ways to learn how to code for dota, you just need to find the right one that works for you. First, you need a grasp on lua: 
&gt;https://www.lua.org/start.html
&gt;If you don't like this website, there are plenty of other websites out there that have a pretty good documentation on lua.
&gt;If you don't like reading straight from a textbook, you can look at videos on how to do it, or  you can look at other people's code and figure out how it works. It's how I learned, but I seriously don't recommend it unless you're an absolutely hands on person because it probably takes more time than reading a how-to.
&gt;Most people would say this is steal coding, and they would be right if you just try to paste a bunch of code together and expect it to work. Programming is exactly like math in a sense where there are so many ways to count to 10.

&gt;Dota 2:
&gt;Probably the most annoying part of coding is dealing with how Dota 2 handles everything. It's the weirdest system of modding I've ever come across but it just werks so w/e.
&gt;Follow guides here: https://moddota.com/forums/tutorial-index , look at already existing code in the lua_data_driven addon they give you, and look at other people's code to learn how to do new things (but don't copy them!). https://github.com/Pizzalol/SpellLibrary
&gt;You may or may not give up at first, I literally tried doing this about a year ago but I saw how clusterfucky it is so I gave up. Then I was bored and decided to put effort into learning it and I finally made a custom gyrocopter hero with toggleable rocket barrage that can damage towers, a homing missile that does damage based on gyro's attack damage, a togglable flak cannon that does bonus damage to targets who are alone. You can do a lot if you just set your mind to it.
&gt;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools/Scripting/API &lt;--- Have this opened at all times. Use CTRL to guess functions that you can use, such as detecting if a hero is alive, to check how much mana a hero has, to check

I can't write a guide for shit so I apollogize if this is all clunky. All you really need to do is to learn how to use lua, learn how dota 2 modding works, and learn how to properly test these mods by using console commands.

"eczema","t5_2rqqs","Aveeno used to make me super itchy! (Also burny if my skin was open, then itchy, then back to burny if I itched...)

I now use Doublebase Dayleve Gel during the day (which is kinda greasy but sinks in quick) and coconut oil at night-time as it's fairly oily (obviously) and takes a little while to sink in - any that gets on my sheets washes right out, however.

I, too, thought that coconut oil was rather expensive as all the brands I saw were advertising themselves as ""organic, raw, virgin, Fair Trade"" coconut oil and about ¬£6 for a ~250ml jar - I recently tried it because I found a Tesco own-brand version (virgin and organic) at ¬£3 for 300ml so it's a fair bit cheaper, obviously, which made me more willing to try it.

I did see a 500ml jar for ¬£2, *however*, it wasn't virgin. What you're looking for is a coconut smell when you open the jar - that's the kind you want to buy.

*For me*, coconut oil doesn't burn. It's really nice and moisturising and smells super good. I also whipped mine with a little almond oil and vanilla fragrance so that I could keep it in the fridge and it wouldn't be rock solid. (Almond oil is essential though if you're allergic any sort of oil i.e. grapeseed oil would likely work as long as it's skin-safe for you, fragrance not necessary)

It also has a multitude of uses so even if it *doesn't* work out for you, you could maybe use it up another way; I bleach and colour my hair blue so I use coconut oil on it after bleaching to restore softness and moisture to my hair, I use it for shaving my legs, and I also use it in the bath in conjunction with Dead Sea Salts - best baths I've ever taken in my life. The Dead Sea Salts *soothe* and do not sting despite the fact that it's salt and the coconut oil moisturises as you soak. *They're so good*. Cooking is also an option! I hear it's popular in Caribbean cooking. :)

Anyhow, everyone's different, so I'd say if you can find a reasonably priced virgin, organic coconut oil like Tesco's, then try it. (Trader Joe's, maybe, if you're American?)

If you can't find a reasonably priced one, then Palmer's Coconut Oil Formula Hand Cream is pretty coconut oil rich and would do well enough as a (probably) cheap tester.

Good luck! :)",1475280469
"Windows10","t5_2u9xs","When did the updates happen, back-to-back?

You most likely received the [Anniversary Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/08/02/new-video-series-this-week-on-windows-highlights-windows-10-anniversary-update/). It is a large (~4GB) Feature Update, which basically re-installs the entire operating system while migrating your drivers/programs/data/profiles in the process. The AU was released Aug 2nd, 2016 - and the only other Windows 10 Feature Update before this one was released Nov, 2015 - so you can expect one every 8-12 months.

The Feature Updates are different from the small cumulative updates in that they define completely different versions of Windows 10. You can see the current 3 versions (1507/1511/1607), and all their small cumulative updates [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history). Support will eventually be dropped for the oldest versions of Windows 10 over time, for now, cumulative updates are still being provided for all 3 versions as shown.

"jailbreak","t5_2r8c5","&gt; It's funny how a great tweak like this is free, yet other devs charge for a simple tweak

It really has more to do with my ideas about the level of support that should be required for something that is being sold, than anything else. I'd love to be making money from this, with all of the time I have spent on tweak development. I'd retire tomorrow if I had enough money to last the rest of my life, so the more I earn, the sooner that day will come.

I don't currently have a single issue with any of my tweaks on my devices but there are so many different combinations of devices, iOS versions and installed tweaks that other people are running that could easily cause problems that I cannot see. Just today, I received a crash report for [Moveable](http://www.tateu.net/repo/html/?p=moveable9) from an iOS 9.0.2 user, something related to the new theming features that I added. I didn't see anything easily identifiable as the cause of the problem in the syslog and crash log. All of my devices are on 9.3.3 and I don't use all of the tweaks that the user has installed...

...and I don't really know what to do to fix the issue.

Moveable is free, though. I do my best to try to help and fix things but, at the end of the day, I have no obligation to do so with a free tweak.

I don't feel that way about paid tweaks, though. Even though the cost is only a few dollars, I believe that if you are going to try to make money from something than you need to provide a working product and support it until it does work. As I stated above, that can be a challenging task with the numerous combinations of setups that exist, and I just can't guarantee that I can always do that and so all but one of my tweaks has been released for free. And my one paid tweak, [MailLabeler](http://www.tateu.net/repo/html/?p=maillabeler9), has been available as a free, open beta for the entire time iOS 9 has been jailbroken, precisely because I haven't been able to commit to being able to fully support it, if needed.

I don't have an exact count but I estimate that about 50% of the developers of paid tweaks that I have tried to contact via email have not responded and I think that is unacceptable.

For developers of free tweaks, I estimate that about 75% of them have not responded to me. That's disappointing but I don't really have an issue with that.",1475280473

"funny","t5_2qh33","I would guess that it has something to do with Matthew 5:

""17 ‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.""

But that depends on the ""us"" in question. There were Israelites who decided to follow Jesus and those who didn't. There were also Gentiles, many of whom had never lived under Levitical law to begin with, some of whom were interested in following Jesus. But some of the laws forbade people who had been made ""unclean"" through what they ate or said or did, from entering places of learning and worship. 

The way I see it, the above passages, as well as those detailing St. Peter's vision, are meant to convey that the Gentiles who want to come learn and follow Jesus should not be turned away because of the practices that rendered them ""unclean"". Although Levitical law was still being upheld by Jesus and his followers, getting Gentiles interested in God's word now took precedence over avoiding spiritual ""contamination"" of oneself. Entry requirements were being waived for those unfamiliar with the law, so they could have the opportunity to learn about it first (among the various other new teachings and interpretations Jesus added into the mix).",1475280475

"duelyst","t5_30w43","What situation is Falcius not able to make good use of its effect? Unless it's the first turn or you're dealing with a deck based entirely on ranged minions, there's probably *some* use in playing Falcius. Even hitting the enemy general for 4 damage-- while taking none of your own-- and dropping a 3/3 minion is a super high-value play. And that doesn't get into the potential for Sajj to double her attack to deal with up to an 8-health minion while taking no damage whatsoever. I really like the concept of Falcius and agree that Vetruvian needs a solid non-Obelysk three-drop, but Falcius is still too powerful in my opinion. The fact that its effects take place on your turn mean that it's that much more difficult to play around, and forces your opponent to position themselves sub-optimally with the knowledge that you *could* drop a Falcius and kill any minion with 4 health or less without repercussion. 

Personally, I think Falcius himself should be a 3/2 and give the general Forcefield for the turn. I don't think it's an excessively heavy-handed nerf, but it allows the enemy general to remove the body the turn after you play it if you've cleared the board.

I couldn't tell you too much about casino security except they wear stupid bile-colored suit jackets.

Hospital security officers have a variety of responsibilities. There's mundane stuff like unlocking doors for staff and doing walking tours of certain hospital areas. You have to take reports for lost or stolen materials and private property accidents. You also get to deal with problem patients that can include physically restraining them. Security also does stand-bys for at-risk patients in the emergency room, which can be exciting at times but mostly super boring. 

I tend to think that hospital security is sorta like doing unarmed, toned-down police work. You deal with a lot of people and you have an opportunity to have face time with those afflicted by mental illness. ProMedica also has a great tuition assistance program as well as in-house courses that can help with career advancement. With their current expansion at their flagship campus as well as their development downtown, there's going to be a lot of employment opportunities.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","Next time your on a baseball field go stand behind third. On the foul line, about 12-15 feet behind the bag. 

Now, pretend the ball is hit. You actually know where this ball is headed, but in real life the umpire doesn't. He has to read the ball like an outfielder. 

Next, run as fast as you can into the outfield. Remember, parallel to the flight of the ball, not perpendicular, so you have an angle. And make sure your are ""set"" (aka completely stopped) when the ball lands. Now that pitch was hit pretty hard, so you have a few seconds to get as close to the fence as possible. 

*If* you read the ball well, got a good jump, and are in good shape, you are still probably  200' or so from the fence. From that position, you have to see where that 3"" ball lands, if it hits anything, or if anyone touches it.

"VintageApple","t5_2x4u1","i'd start with trying  65/85w adaptor from a 15/17"" power book first just to be sure- 

My next suspicion would be that battery.. god only knows how old the stock was, i'd probably try it in a known good machine, or try to get it swapped from the seller before moving on to repairs, DOA parts are a thing..

but if its on to repairing it-  if the machine recognizes the power adapter and swaps to charging mode (orange ring on an original apple adapter, or ""charging"" in system profiler) - then the DC-In board is probably OK.

which then brings us to the DC-DC board- not a repair thats too difficult if you have experience on any newer machines, but it'll be a bear if its your first repair.- Given that you have seen a small charge.. i still think the DC-DC board is OK, and its that battery, i again highly recommend trying another battery first.

if it does come down to taking it apart - 
the most important advice will be ""BE VERY CAREFUL when disconnecting the small snap-in connectors under the keyboard (the power button and audio), they are incredibly easy to break, even when they were brand new.""",1475280480

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","Short answer 

Ultrasabers is the cheap, easy, quick option. They offer empty hilts, stunt(Light but no sound), and their Obsidian sound boards. They're effectively the Wal Mart option of the saber hobby. They catch the most flak for their hilts which are huge and the overall quality of their electronics assembly are.....less than ideal. 

Saberforge is a step above. They have the largest selection of good looking sabers. Their quality can be a little suspect but they have a devoted following. 

Vaders Vault is my personal choice. I'm definitely a fan boy. Great quality but you're gonna pay for it and the wait times are 6+ months right now. That being said, I can't personally say I've ever seen anyone who was less than completely satisfied. 

Genesis Custom Sabers is a one man operation. The absolute best custom saber maker, in my opinion, but being a one man operation, he only takes custom work that interests him. Otherwise, your best bet is to wait until he releases his limited runs of his designed sabers. 

Determine how much you're wanting to spend and what exactly you want your saber to do. 

Ultrasabers and Saberforge also offer empty hilts. So you can buy say an empty Silver Knight from Saberforge and either install the electronics yourself or you can send it to someone(actually a very popular choice among enthusiasts) and install exactly what you want in your saber. This is also a good budget option. Grab an empty for cheap. Do the install when you're a little more liquid. You'll have a chance to see if you even like the way the hilt rests in your hands",1475280487

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","&gt;One of the biggest obstacles to achieving unionization is getting 2/3rds (or is it 3/4ths? can't remember) of the fighters on board.

I think that in general MMA fans on the internet badly over-estimate the value of most fighters to the UFC, especially in regards to unionization and potential strikes, and in doing so under-estimate the value of the biggest draws.

I've seen lots of people on here draw comparisons to the unionization of the NBA, NFL etc but I don't think these people understand the fundamental differences between the 2 business models that make the comparison meaningless.

In team sports it makes sense for players to unionize. As teams are constantly competing against each other, and the fans of each team are the lifeblood of the leagues, it's vital that each team have all of their players available. If the Cavs bench players go on strike it destroys their chance to win a championship, as such that's something everyone involved, from the owner (Dan Gilbert) to the fans to the star players (Lebron) to the GM (Also Lebron) to the coach (still Lebron) are desperate to prevent.

However in combat sports lower level fighters are almost entirely overlooked by casual fans (who are the lifeblood of combat sports). I mean look at the undercard of MayPac. It was far worse than any PPV, or even Fox show, the UFC have put on in the modern era. It was Lomachenko and Gonzalez, 2 really exciting young prospects, in uncompetitive squash matches solely to advertise themselves. After that it was just a bunch of random guys and guys from Mayweather's gym. And yet that card was bigger than anything the UFC has ever put on. For an example closer to home look at Ronda's last 2 cards. Those were the 2 worst cards (the Bethe one especially) I can remember the UFC putting on in the modern era. The Bethe card was a travesty filled with legends far past their prime and local, low-level Brazilian fighters (incredibly the UFC showed they could put on a great card filled with Brazilian fighters if they wanted to for 198 they just couldn't be arsed for 190 because they knew Ronda would sell on her own) and yet it did 900,000 buys. 194 vs Holm was better but still very weak imo. The Joanna fight was cool but there wasn't anything else really noteworthy on that card. And yet it did 1.1 million. To put that into perspective Jones did 300,000 against OSP, Gus, and Glover. Lawler-Condit did 300,000 even after all the promotion Lawler got from 189.

The fighter's who can bring serious benefits to the UFC's brand and help them make profits (McGregor, Ronda, Brock) are extremely well taken care of. Even fighters who aren't crossover superstars but are still assets to the company are well taken care of (Bisping (http://mma-manifesto.com/ufc-fighter-salary-database/salary-main/michael-bisping-career-earnings.html), Overeem, Hendo and to a lesser extent Sage, Lauzon etc.) are all on very good money. Other fighters either don't bring enough value to the UFC, they don't have significant leverage (i.e. Brock can play the UFC off against the WWE, Sage can say he'll just go back to university if he's not getting payed) or they fucked up in negotiations (TJ on 12/12 for his last fight, Nate and his dumbfuck contract).

That sounds silly nowadays, but back then when ""breast"" wasn't considered fit to print in media and there was no real awareness of breast cancer, lots of people trusted the doctors they knew their whole lives rather than seek out a specialist.

She had a lumpectomy and mastectomy and by the time she went to MD Anderson in Texas it was too late to get under control. ETA she had a family history of cystic breasts which is why a lump in and of itself wouldn't have been concerning initially.

"Wellington","t5_2s3eo","I live in Eastbourne as well. I used to be on ADSL with (IIRC) ~6 Mbs down and 768 kbs upload. I switched to VDSL when Snap became 2 Degrees and went to 18 Mbs down but upload struggled between 230-512 kbs. I figured this was due to our distance from the exchange (900+ meters).

2 Degrees suggested having a master filter installed through Chorus (199 NZD fixed price) and opted for that as our phone connection point is at a very awkward location. Chorus guy did a great job on the install and my connection went up to 32 Mbs download and 2 Mbs upload and a lot more stable too. (Previously a single person watching HD Netflix or YouTube would hog the entire connection - it's way better now).

So long story short : if you are having xDSL issues (and even if you haven't), install a master filter. They aren't expensive and it's something you can do yourself or have it done for 199 NZD through Chorus through your ISP.  It will do for us until we finally get fibre here in Eastbourne.....

When he was filming The Revenant, he commented on how extreme and unprecedented warm weather caused them to leave Canada to find snow.  [Which was ridiculous](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/leonardo-dicaprio-chinooks-climate-change-1.3358972).  What he experienced was a Chinook wind, a very old and well-known phenomenon where warm air comes down from the mountains and the weather changes suddenly.

Western Canadians laughed at it, but he didn't apologize or back off when he was corrected.  [He brought it up again in his Oscar acceptance speech](https://www.bustle.com/articles/144803-transcript-of-leonardo-dicaprios-oscars-acceptance-speech-gets-political-about-climate-change-video).

""Raising awareness"" of climate change is cool, and DiCaprio wants to be a part of that, and he isn't really that interested in the details (like getting stories right or practicing what he preaches).  It's slacktivism for multimillionaires.

Either way, though, I don't support legalizing everything at once.  I think if full legalization across the board is the answer, it needs to be done slowly and carefully.

Loved the pink corndog, that shit was almost the seamless shot, slipped at last second, ha ha.  That was nice, got a nice sense of her asshole stretching out around it.  Would have rather she just worked it in like she would up doing, but could live with bro doing it. I want to know who wound up holding it, was it in his mouth or directors hand? lol

Pretty funny when she goes to blow with heels on. couldved dropped the shoe removal part, but when she kicks off the 2nd one it's pretty fuckin funny.

The semi raised on bed position worked well, good perspective, felt a tad forward. It felt like Madelyn was in my lap, or close, which is the desired effect.  When you looked at your shit, your eyes are where they are supposed to be, looking down at it, not across at it. 

Bro does not have the inches for reverse lean away anal doggie.  It becomes a game of waiting for it to pop out again.  

first doggy felt weird, then second after edit felt much better, was trying to ride the edit and determine besides centering what changed, he is both centered and a bit more forward in the shot after the edit, but it was hard to sense what had changed besides that.

nice anal time overall also, just the right amount of setup

kisses were all pretty solid. 

some serious that-was-almost-puke choking moments, ha ha. 

Mish felt OK, looked nice. bit distant, not say as present as perhaps skylar.  It really helps to bring the distance in less than 90 degrees to their heads, even by just 10, 20 degrees. 

Still waiting on that killer Wankz anal scene.  Corndog was probably my fave.  Dick poppin out or on verge robbed steam from mid section, doggie and mish were better in that sense.

No, when you spend your time making life difficult for other people for no good reason, it's griefing. And it's a waste of everyone's time. Anyone who spends their time blocking other players, just because it's a game mechanic, needs to evaluate their life choices.

&gt; If you cant deal with it, play something else, as simple as that.

I did. As did almost everyone else. Did you notice how the game sucked and had terrible unfun mechanics like player collision? These are the same unfun mechanics we do *not* want to see in WoW.

&gt; Didnt Warhammer also have Collision?

It did, only in PvP scenarios though, the equivalent of turning it on only in WoW battlegrounds or arena.

Is that how you determine what's moral from immoral? Whether or not ""outside sources"" come into play? How do you think the egg got fertilized in the first place? Though conscious intentional (usually) work! What's so special about ""outside sources""? I've yet to see that explained.

&gt; Again, the point where outside sources go from starting the process to interrupting it is NOT the definition of life or morality. It simply defines the only discrete measurable point before a child is unquestionably determined to be living.

That's not how we determine what's alive and what isn't. You can your own personal definition at your own discretion, obviously. But it's not scientific. You're just inventing your own definition.

If the prompt returns something containing ""**DisableDeleteNotify = 0**"", TRIM is enabled, and you're good (http://mywindowshub.com/check-enable-disable-ssd-trim-support-windows-7-windows-8-1/).

Fragmentation is a problem for mechanical, spinning-disk drives, whose reading heads have to move up and down the disk to access information. A fragmented file might reside partially at the beginning of the disk, partially in the middle, and partially at the end of the disk, causing the drive to have to work extra in order to render it. To illustrate fragmentation, imagine a record player having to move up and down the record multiple times, to play one song. The reading head would have to move away from the record, find the right location on the record, and move back onto the record to read one part of the song, then do the same to find another part of it, and so on until it has played the full song.

SSDs do not need defragmentation because no moving parts are involved in their operation. Overall, every bit of information is accessed electronically only, and thus at the same speed, no matter where on the drive it is located. As long as TRIM is enabled, which maintains the drive running sharply during its lifespan, you're covered.",1475280501

He's very polite, pleasant, modest smiles. Soft non threatening tone of voice. He acts like anyone else from there acts. No scowls, no hip hop body language. No slang, no ""black pride"" (which, to me is just the hatred of white people and overflowing self entitlement due to years of oppression that they themselves have never personally experienced, yet demand compensation for anyway)

He was just..... A dude. Not a black dude.... Not a black Japanese dude. He was just.... A dude.

about 95% of my comment was centered around objective morality not existing, which is precisely why it does NOT boil down to ""use your brain and youre fine"", and I never said it existed, I just said it's totally reasonable to pursue something that is objective and consistent with our values, NOT something objectively morally right.

&gt;An engineer with ill intend will not not make an ""unethical"" thing just because you told him so

I assume you mean an engineer with ill intent will not *refrain* from creating an unethical thing because he learned about it in an ethics course, but thats besides the point by a large margin again, an ethics course is not held for people with ill will, its held for people prone to making mistakes due to obliviousness, which are the vast majority.

&gt;People will make things based on their own judgement and I honestly don't see an ethics course changing any of that

well in that case you appear to be pretty short-sighted. There are few people narcissistic enough to completely disregard what they have learned about the values of their society by people more educated about them than they are. 

&gt;Maybe this is just the result of me not wanting to be told what is and is not right and wrong, but I honestly don't see any use in ethics courses.

Sorry, but this just sounds incredibly narcissistic. You have already established that you are aware that there is no objective morality, yet you are going to completely ignore outside input and act solely on what you determine to be morally correct? In that case you are genuinely unfit to do *anything* with possible repercussions to society or *anyone*. 

&gt;A mentally ill person would not be able to reason about how ""ethical"" something is because they are mentally ill.

you are aware that there are different kinds of mental illnesses, with different effects on the people affected by it? How you assume that anyone that is mentally ill in one way or another is unable to reason is beyond me, honestly. 

&gt;Also, the ethics courses I have seen dont teach you psychic powers that let you see how your invention could possibly be used in the future. Reasoning about the applications of an invention is a basic skill that anyone that can invent something as novel as that already possess.

Yet reasoning about the ethical and societal consequences of those applications is not. Are you seriously suggesting that the inventors of mobile phones were aware that they would cause central africa to turn into a deathstruck warzone of warlords fighting over rare materials only found there? Are you suggesting that every video game designer is aware of the larger ramifications of wasting energy on unskippable, unseen or unnoticed elements that are not part of the game and therefore not relevant to the customers opinion of it?

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Oh my, as soon as you heard that interview from Jensen during the game you knew this would end bad. He wanted to solo kill Faker too much and went super overaggressive, not the typical Jensen we saw in NA. Even though in NA he got solo killed, it was 'cause he was winning lane and made some dumb mistake, but this was him legit letting Faker hit him constantly in lane and then not flash Syndra combo for that first death, very strange.

So for sure this was Jensen's fault, also damn Wolf two ganks didn't help him (That first Wolf gank where he killed Jensen, Jensen might have actually killed Faker getting Cass ult off right before he died.) But we also gotta say how bad Meteos was doing, he's playing Lee Sin but he's constantly farming the jungle. Also his flash, ward jump kick on Faker made no sense. When Hai has a better Lee than Meteos that's kind of a problem.

So yeah, Jensen focussed too hard on killing Faker, but Meteos afk farming as  Lee didn't help. When Syndra can just walk past turret to freely harass Jensen, that's an issue.",1475280503

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","[Here's a study on waning pertussis immunity] (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200850#t=article) I was wrong there is still some protection after 5 years, but it wanes fast, 42% a year.  And that is after the fifth TDaP shot.. so in this case the immune system does not become immune to the disease.  Pertussis is a quickly mutating virus and overall efficacy has likely decreased since this study. [Here is another interesting study that shows that the pertussis vaccine greatly increases colonization of parapertussis, another strain of whooping cough] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200027).  This is why were having increased whooping cough outbreaks despite record high vaccine compliance.  The vaccine itself is actually helping spread the disease.  The same can likely be said of increased measles and mumps outbreaks despite record compliance.   It is becoming obvious that efficacy, especially of mumps, was overstated and the vaccine needs to be reformulated.  It's an absolute shame the scientists who developed the vaccine have been forced to sue the manufacturer to get this to happen.. it's the same pharmaceutical greed we're so used to seeing.  Through intense lobbying (pharma spends the most money lobbying the government than any other industry by a wide margin) vaccine manufacturers have become nearly completely immune to any type of litigation, meaning they have next to no onus to improve their vaccines.

[http://www.healthsentinel.com/joomla/images/stories/graphs/us-measles.jpg] (here is a graph on historical measles death rates) .  As you can see the death rate plummeted to near 0 before the vaccine was even introduced.  I'm not disputing that the vaccine has greatly decreased infection rate, which it obviously has, I'm saying that the death rate mainly decreased due to better nutrition, sanitation, and medical practices.

I think the problem with autism is that because it's identification is purely behavioural, there could be a lot of underlying problems  or stressors that can result in that behaviour, something similar to ADD.  There is no one cause, some of it is genetic, some of it is due to environmental toxins, some of it is due to overactive prolonged autoimmune response in the brain and gut for whatever reason.  But we must admit that autism rates are increasing, they are not static, it's simply a fact.  Just like how a variety of other autoimmune conditions are absolutely exploding in prevalence, food allergies being a big one.  400x prevalence is a mind bogglingly huge increase.. a 40,000% increase.

The effects don't die down because the brain can't go back to the most important stages of development which occur in young children.  It all comes down to aluminum toxicity.  A single round of vaccines can have 50x the ingested limit of aluminum for ADULTS.  This is in kids, and it's not ingested, its INJECTED.  And that is where the problem lies: ""only 0.3% of orally administered aluminum is absorbed via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the kidneys effectively eliminate aluminum from the human body. Only when the GI barrier is bypassed, such as by intravenous infusion or in the presence of advanced renal dysfunction, does aluminum have the potential to accumulate. As an example, with intravenously infused aluminum, 40% is retained in adults and up to 75% is retained in neonates.[4]""

""Aluminum causes an oxidative stress within brain tissue.[13] Since the elimination half-life of aluminum from the human brain is 7 years, this can result in cumulative damage via the element's interference with neurofilament axonal transport and neurofilament assembly.""

Blaylock et al suggest that the heterogeneous symptoms of autism spectrum disorders have a connection with dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain along with enhancement of excitatory receptor function by proinflammatory immune cytokines as the underlying pathophysiological process.""

What this is all saying is up to 75% of injected aluminum in children stays in the body, it's half-life is 7 years!  So once it's in the brain it stays there, causing a large prolonged inflammatory response by immune cytokines, which in turn disrupts glutamate neurotransmission which is linked to the symptoms of autism.

Vaccines used to contains small amounts of live viruses.  The problem was, even though most people's body would mount a strong enough immune response to give them immunity, they still had a small amount of live virus in them, this virus would act like it normally does and ""shed"" through saliva, etc, making the vaccine recipient a vector for transmission, sometimes this would be enough to infect old, sick, or immunocompromised individuals.  Manufacturers responded to this problem by reformulating with acellular or dead virus vaccines.  The problem with the dead virus is the immune system wouldn't see it as a threat and wouldn't mount enough of an immune response for immunity.  The solution to this was ever increasing amounts of aluminum.  The body's main reaction to aluminum is to mount an enormous immune response to try to get rid of it.  We throw the dead virus in the mix and hope the body will also produce antibodies to the virus.  It works, somewhat, but in attempts to get bigger antibody responses we're adding in too much aluminum that the body can't get rid of..",1475280503

That first gank by bengi was completely scouted out... and Jensen just has a bronze moment for it. Ends up walking in a straight line backward vs a Syndra for a free stun, after greedily pushing up even though he knew exactly where Bengi was.

This is when I knew the game was literally over, though- shortly after that gank, Jensen and Meteos go for SKT's blue. They were successful in getting it... but Jensen was panicking with no pressure, using his E by mistake on the small mobs instead of taking the blue buff. What does he do next? A couple trades, then waltzes through the lane with 1/4 hp right in front of a level 6 syndra with ultimate, handing faker blue buff.

So like...that is the correct direction. But have you thought to phrase it with a more older voice‚Ä¶like ‚ÄúI have decided not to speak with any of you further.‚Äù ? I don‚Äôt wanna is unfortunately attributed to kids. You mean business, show them that.

&gt;I don‚Äôt owe you an explanation 

Good!

but the reason is your addiction and inability to be there for me when I need you most. 

This is JADE territory. You don‚Äôt owe them an explanation. You have decided to cut contact. 

&gt;It certainly isn‚Äôt the only example of a time you let me down, but getting hit by a car, getting shaken down for money and then having my money stolen really put things into perspective for me. 

Technically this is still justifying ‚Äì The J of JADE. I‚Äôd cut this if I were you.

&gt;I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to spend on people who frankly just don‚Äôt care what happens to me. I just can‚Äôt handle the rejection and disappointment of finding myself with zero support in a situation when I need it again.

This is the E of JADE, Explaining. You do not need to explain to them why. No contact is about YOU not them. 

&gt;At some point I may feel the need to allow you back into my life and I can only hope that you will be sober and ready to have an equal relationship with me, but concerning past and recent behavior I don‚Äôt see myself or any of you getting to a place where I feel comfortable talking to you any time soon. 

This sentence is a bit long. I‚Äôd shorten it to something like, ‚ÄúWhile I may not feel like this permanently, I definitely feel this way in the short term.‚Äù

&gt;Do not misunderstand. This is not a cry for attention and I am done trying to fix our various relationships. 

Nice!

&gt;I have tried for a very long time to help each of you and to teach you to respect my boundaries which you often disregard. I am no longer going to hold out hope of fixing our relationships.

I think this is redundant if you look at your above paragraph.

&gt;Sisters name, there isn‚Äôt anything inherently wrong with you I just can‚Äôt be around you because you are so immersed in whatever everyone else is doing and you drag me back into it. I want to see you grow up to be proud, strong, and happy but I just can‚Äôt handle being around drugs, alcohol, and the hoops I have to jump through for affection anymore. You obviously have different goals in life than I do and I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt help you with them. I tried my best to be a big sister to you and even though I wasn‚Äôt who you needed me to be I know you‚Äôll find someone who can do better by you. Please demand excellence from those around you.

I would definitely not call someone out in a letter. Draft a letter to her separately.

&gt;Once again this is a letter telling you NOT to contact me in any way shape or form. If you do contact me I will treat it as the insult it is.

I would add ‚Äúvia mail, calls, texts, email social media or in person‚Äù. Just to be clear.

&gt;You have one daughter and sister left. Don‚Äôt screw it up.
 
Eh, I‚Äôd take this out. Not because it‚Äôs not true, but because it isn‚Äôt about you. Going No Contact is about you, not them.

More than anything, it's a loud and public slap to the face. Maybe they can start suing Americans for whatever frivolous legal reasons they can invent in their OWN courts, for homosexuality for example.  Why not start suing American soldiers and diplomats for breaking religious laws? They don't even need a legitimate reason. They can have a political grudge to settle, and they'll just come up with whatever reason they want to to sue or arrest Americans, especially diplomats and soldiers.

The worse part is that now it's not just the Saudi's that can do this now. Any other country can take action based on this precedent. Do you realize how many different countries whose toes that United States have stepped on in the past century? Between all the coups and CIA-trained death squads in just the Americas, far more have suffered far worse than 9/11 families.

And you might think that it's great that everyone's getting their just (and maybe not so just) desserts. It's going to cost a lot of money to litigate these cases in foreign courts, especially considering that I doubt there are that many American lawyers versed in foreign laws. And I can only imagine the amount damages you can sue for when the United States installs dictators and train death squads in your country. Good luck paying for that.

And then now every American soldier and diplomat can now work in a capacity knowing that foreign governments have a brand new, passive-aggressive, backed by American precedent method of retaliating against the United States that could potentially culminate in their arrest.

"artificial","t5_2qhfb","So my idea is a bit more abstract and I'm working out the fine details, but this is the gist of it:

There are 5 main processing modules.

Module 1: Input control

- This module takes arbitrary input data and converts it to a universal format. Input data is how the agent learns about the world. The input data needs to be structured so that a transformation can take place, but it doesn't matter how. Think of it like having different senses, but generalized to whatever hardware you want to add.

- This module also handles things like attention and context management. By context management I mean it figures out what senses correspond to the same thing.



Module 2: World View

- This module is the agent's representation of the world, in some structured format. This is where information from the input is aggregated to form representations of things in memory. For example, when you think of a tree, you know what one looks like, how the bark feels, and other abstract relationships like ""tree is plant"" or ""tree has leaves"".

- It's critical that this module produces representations that are as unambiguous as possible. This is necessary for constructing abstract representations of things, which an agent needs to do if it wants to reason about an unfamiliar situation. For example, every time you see a tree you think ""tree"" and the ""tree"" you think of is the same for every tree you see, even though every tree you've ever seen has been different. The next time you see a tree, you can recognize it as such, and can plan accordingly.



Module 3: Simulation

- This module is the core of the decision-making process. In short, the agent is able to solve any given problem by creating a simulation of the world based on its world view. I envision a planner-style approach, with a few things added:

 - 1. As with most planners, the world is represented as a finite state machine. You have a start state and a goal state and the objective is to reach the goal state through a series of transformations to the world state.

 - 2. At each step of the simulation, any agent in the simulation is capable of taking a finite set of actions. The agent decides what agents to include in this, depending on the task. The actions taken determine how the world state is modified.

 - 3. Actions are defined as a set of events which have preconditions and postconditions. Preconditions describe the world state necessary for the action to take place, and the postconditions are a modification of the current world state. IMPORTANT: the preconditions and postconditions are defined by the world view.

- Such an approach has some key advantages: 

 - When the agent executes its plan, any differences between the planned world state and the actual world state can be noted. This is how the agent can learn. If the plan fails to accomplish its main objective, the agent can sort of back-trace to find out what part of its world-view is wrong, otherwise it doesn't need to care.

 - If the plan succeeds, however, the agent can store the whole plan as an action for future use. This works because of the assumption that if the world-view hasn't changed, the plan shouldn't change. Considering how an agent would rarely ever be in the same exact situation, this may seem useless. However, because all logic here operates on abstractions of the world, a lot of it should carry over.

- One thing I've been thinking about this approach is that it may require a sort of hierarchy of actions. For example, if the agent doesn't know the fine details, but it is able to form a complete plan from a high-level perspective, the agent will need to resolve the details when it's actually executing the plan. I.E. You're let into a room and around the corner. After a while you want to leave. Your plan is to walk back out through the door. As you approach the door you see it is now closed. Based on your world view, you know that opening the door will allow you to walk through it. You perform the necessary actions and continue with the original plan.


I'm sure there are numerous ways to implement the simulation part, but the only criteria is that it utilizes the agent's world view knowledge to formulate plans.



Module 4: Directives

- The purpose of this module is to decide which plans to formulate and execute at any given time. It's necessary for 2 reasons: 1) the agent is useless without some given purpose 2) the agent has a finite amount of processing power. It's like the scheduler of an operating system, managing the priorities of various tasks and controlling their resource usage.



Module 5: Output control

- This is simply tied to the agent's actions. These define the set of actions that the self can take. This is completely arbitrary and dependent on the specific embodiment of the agent. For example, we humans can speak or move our arms or legs etc. but an AI could have other things built in.

- Given a particular plan, the agent needs to execute any of its own actions, which this module manages.



The caveats:

- These modules are pretty vague, and I have yet to determine exactly how they all interact with each other. At a glance the modules seem pretty feed-forward but I don't think this is the case in practice.

- I briefly mentioned attention mechanisms in the input control but they are definitely not to be overlooked as again, the agent is operating on finite memory and processing power. I think either the directives or the simulation plans should determine what to pay attention to.

- I didn't mention output control, as the agent doesn't necessarily need to be embodied.

I think that's the gist of my idea. Let me know what you think. I'm still trying to figure out the specifics, but I feel like it's pretty solid from a high-level standpoint. My main struggle right now is the knowledge representation aspect (i.e. what format is necessary) and how that ties into the simulation (how to identify preconditions/postconditions).

Edit: formatting

Means literally nothing, it's not as if you asked him if you could kill him for his bounty then did it.  

Also killing heist members isn't against the rules, do it all you want.  Just don't act surprised when people don't think your great ""bounty collection method"" is some genius plan straight from Oceans 11

I can empathise with parts of your feelings, such as wanting to unleash oneself to promiscuity (though my desires change depending on how much good stuff I have been doing, like Ibaadah).

I, too, have been made fortunate by Allah in having good parents and upbringing; I stayed at home during university and I strongly believe I would have been sexually deviant if not for my parents' discipline that Allah has graced me with.

I have had thoughts where it is almost as if I fear, or feel disappointed, that the chances to ""have"" all those women out there will be gone when (Insha-Allah) I get married.

Reading your post reminded me of this Ayat from the Quran (closest translation of the meaning):

&gt; ""In addition, amongst His signs is this that He created for you mates from amongst yourselves, so that you may dwell in tranquillity with them, and ***He has put love and mercy between your hearts***. Undoubtedly in these are signs for those who reflect."" (30:21)

Pondering upon this, I *feel* that if a person *decides* to marry, and marries solely for the sake of Allah and to fulfill the Sunnah of the Prophet (S.A.W), and also conducts the actual marriage according to Quran and Sunnah, then Allah will bless this person and their marriage, and will make it easy for them during the marriage. Perhaps if a person were worried that they might find it difficult to cope with having to remain for the rest of their life with one person (in terms of intimacy), then Allah could take that difficulty away and he would put love between the hearts of the couple (""***He has put love and mercy between your hearts***""). Of course, lot's of sincere dua would be necessary to ask Allah for this.

These are only my thoughts based upon what little knowledge I have, and not a scholarly opinion.

Perhaps reading this Ayat from the Quran will allay some of your fears and put your heart at rest, Insha-Allah; I know it gives me hope.

May Allah make it easy for you, and us all. Ameen.",1475280521

[Norwegian Wood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood) by Haruki Murakami, a love story set in Japan, some really beautiful writing in here, this is maybe my favorite from the month

[On the Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70401.On_the_Road) by Jack Kerouac I thought was decent but seemed to drag a bit, however I think that adds to the story in some ways so I'm conflicted there. My first exposure to Beat Generation writing

[The Unbearable Lightness of Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9717.The_Unbearable_Lightness_of_Being) by Milan Kundera left me confused in all honesty, I think I missed the point a bit. This one didn't really do much for me

[Neither Here nor There](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27.Neither_Here_nor_There) by Bill Bryson is one I would avoid, Bill Bryson is generally pretty funny from my experience but here he seems to spend a lot of time complaining which makes for poor reading",1475280521

"IndieGaming","t5_2r0e3","At a very high level, there are two instances of math used in game coding: interface math and algorithm math.

Algorithm math is the complex stuff most people think about, such as calculating probabilities and trajectories and all those black box things designed to simulate certain behaviours for the player.  That's the kind of stuff you really need a good number sense to wrap your head around the complex interactions.

Interface math is the stuff for things like collision detection and movement, and is actually incredibly simple.  Unlike real life, the beauty of programming is that you can make things that are ""self-aware"" in that they can check their own properties themselves.  If you have an object start at point 0, and every time the player presses right they move right 1 point, you can just ask the object where it is.  If you want to check if it has collided with something, you have the two objects ask each other if their location is overlapping and let you know without you having to do any manual calculations.

Honestly, the limiter to coding isn't math, it's keeping track of the ""trickle down"" of actions.  In the real world, if you want to give a thumbs up, you just do it.  However, if you stop and think about what is going on at the baser level, your brain is sending signals to several individual muscle clusters to condense or relax themselves a certain amount; your brain doesn't output a thumbs up, it outputs a set of very simple commands that manifest as a thumbs up to an observer.

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","In some communist circles, equality means creating political structures that prevent the centralization of wealth and political power.

We don‚Äôt actually believe that everyone will want to act in the best interest of whole, communists may promote doing so but it can‚Äôt be assumed, and this leads to radical democracy. 

This means not just running the state democratically, but also running the workplace democratically. Leadership should be elected by the workers where it is needed but the workers should also have the right to a recall vote triggered by a simple motion to recall the leader.

Running a workplace democratically would allow workers to decide how to invest resources, and how to distribute the value of their production.  

Regarding the state, if one exists, any sort of parliament would be elected by and from among the workers, and again all of these leadership roles would be subject to recall to avoid the abuse of power.

Some models include a bicameral system where one house of parliament is elected from the general population, and another from the workers.

Also there is often a lot of talk about how to structure elections to avoid a two party system from developing, like the system we have in the United States, but the point is if a political system is radically democratic including a democratically driven economy it prevents the centralization of wealth and power that we see in capitalist systems.

*****
&gt; This has been show to hold for other factors that are both outside the control of the manager, and observable to the boards who grant compensation, yet rarely adjust it for these factors.

&gt; How much of the &amp;quot;Pay-for-performance&amp;quot; compensation is actually paid for luck?

&gt; The answer to this question depends on the ratio between the manager&amp;#039;s talent, T, defined as her ability to increase the firm&amp;#039;s average return, and the inherent &amp;quot;Noise&amp;quot; in the stock&amp;#039;s returns, as measured by the standard deviation of returns, &amp;sigma;R. We develop an analytical expression for the proportion of option-based compensation that constitutes pay-for-luck as a function of the ratio &amp;sigma;R  T. We show that this proportion grows very quickly with &amp;sigma;R  T. For the empirically estimated parameters the pay-for-luck component exceeds 90% of the compensation.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","12 Team Standard

Planning for massive bye week next week and ROS.

My Team: 

QB Brees (bye week next week)

WR Hopkins, Maclin (bye week), Cobb, Parker, Tyrell Williams

RB Charles/Ware (both have bye weeks), Jennings, Dwayne Washington, Dixon, Rawls (bye week, injured anyway)

Normally I would drop Parker for a QB and start Jennings Washington Hopkins Cobb and Williams. Except for Williams (@OAK) they all have rather bad matchups. 

ROS:

Moncrief and Corey Coleman are both FA right now. I'm thinking of stashing at least Moncrief for Parker (and maybe Coleman for Williams). Who would you pick up?

Next week:

If I pick up Moncrief or both that leaves me in a sticky situation, because I can't roster a full team without dropping Rawls or Dixon for a one-week QB and I'd like to keep them both tbh. This leaves me with following options

a) dropping my D/ST (streaming) / TE (streaming) / Kicker (Bailey) and play without one

b) play wihout a QB

The biggest thing that pisses me off though is they try to spread the myth that black people are underprivileged but we all know this isn't true (I'm black too and I am not underprivileged)

Can the failing globe seriously just accept they're a failure and just shut down already at the same time though i don't know how much time we have before we become a Muslim country and women are banned from reading literature and we must wear hijabs.

They only work if you learn to do them correctly; if you do them correctly, they'll be heavy as fuck. Too many people do sets of rep after rep with weightlifting and if you can do that then you're not pushing yourself enough. The point is to have to explode fast enough so that you barely have enough time to get underneath the bar; if you're under the bar without having to catch it in the hole of a front squat, it's probably not heavy enough. Do take your time to learn it correctly, preferably from a weightlifting coach. They will help the other events slightly too.

You're probably quite young. And I don't say it in an insulting manner. I, myself, am younger than 20 years old and also didn't get it at first because I didn't feel identified with it and didn't understand what it was all about. But after gaining some context I understood it was one of the most important films to have come out lately. You should read about it. Also, everything was on point: The acting, the editing, the script, the direction, the soundtrack, and, of course, the cinematography.

Now, about the cinematography, it did look pretty and everything. But, most importantly, it reinforces what the movie is trying to tell us. Which is what differentiates good aestheticists from... Zack Snyder. They use the camera to help us see what the movie is trying to tell us appart from giving us nice eye-candy.",1475280534

As for the people aren't out to be a douchebag part...WELL, do you think evil characters see themselves as such? We can argue about their actions and reasoning all day, but you can usually draw a fine line that characters have crossed or not. A douchebag isn't likely to think themselves to be a douchebag. It just happens along the way. It doesn't change the fact that the person is a douchebag.

"Crouton","t5_2yv5a","From the [wiki](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/upgrade%20chroot%20release): 
&gt;To upgrade to a more recent version of Ubuntu, you can use Ubuntu's update manager, or follow these instructions in a crosh shell:
&gt;
&gt; * sudo enter-chroot -n &lt;chroot_name&gt; (replace &lt;chroot_name&gt; by the name of your chroot, e.g. raring)
&gt; * sudo apt-get install update-manager-core python-apt
&gt; * sudo do-release-upgrade
&gt;
&gt; After the upgrade, it is important to make sure that crouton is updated:
&gt;
&gt; * sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -n &lt;chroot_name&gt; -u
&gt; 
&gt; By default, the name of a chroot is its release name (e.g. a raring chroot's name is raring). After an upgrade, you end up with a saucy chroot, whose name is raring. Confusing? You can easily rename it with:
&gt;
&gt; * sudo edit-chroot -m saucy raring

To install xenial (16.04) directly in a new crouton:

    sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r xenial

If you install directly, it will create a fresh crouton instance that is ""separate"" from your existing trusty installation, however if your trusty crouton is not encrypted, you can copy files over via the filesystem. Nothing is deleted from your existing crouton and you can still launch it after installing a new xenial crouton using the ""-n &lt;old crouton name, e.g., 'trusty'&gt;"" option.",1475280537

Millar simply never addresses how Superman reacts to the Stalinist atrocities that have happened and are happening offscreen, and how on fucking Earth can you not? 

You could write a decent story about Superman struggling with the morality of ruling, but it would be pretty abstract. What I'd like to see is Superman struggling with the morality of what he needs to do in order to rule, with the direct consequences of the choices he has to make to maintain order, for the greater good.

"AskEconomics","t5_2selg","One thing that's important to point out - under your scenario, the north would explicitly be subsidizing the south with cash payments. 

The reason America can work with a single currency and with the same programs on a federal level is that we have two important factors:

* free movement of population and very little cultural barriers in the way of movement - one language as an example, one set of laws.
* Massive transfer payments between the rich areas and the poor areas.  New York and California and Texas pay way more money into the Federal government than most states per capita, and they subsidize Mississippi and West Virginia and so on to a very large degree.

If the EU wanted to be a federal state, you'd need to see MORE of the north subsidizing the south, not less.  If Greece and Germany had the same rules about X level welfare and medical coverage, Germany would be able to pay for it and Greece wouldn't.  In order to keep promises to those in Greece, the northern countries would subsidize Greece's pensioners.  

This is just like how New Yorkers and Mississippians are both promised Medicare, but New York contributes enough to pay for it while Mississippi doesn't.  So New York makes up the difference for Mississippi so that those in Mississippi don't go without Medicare.

On the female side, they appear to still be getting stronger, so I think they'll continue to close the gap on the male athletes. I think as a result, female weights are going to need to be scaled up if they want the events to remain at the same level/time domain as they are for the male athletes. Ditto what I said about the males for aerobic capacity. 

As for ""crossfit"" as a brand, I forsee it coming untied from Reebok and not locking it's self down to another brand. It's big enough now to operate on its own without needing a company like that behind it.

http://www.gallup.com/poll/117328/marriage.aspx

In 2008, 56% of people opposed gay marriage, while 40% supported it. That's not insignificant. 

It's also the same year that California (yes, *that* California -- bastion of liberalism) voted down an amendment that would have made gay marriage legal in the state. 

Gay marriage was not popular in 2008. Also note that it was Obama's own campaign manager who convinced him to withhold his true (favorable) stance on gay marriage, so they must have had internals that said it would be costly for him in the election. 

Obama did something he didn't want to in the short term (lie about his true position) in order to achieve his goal in the long term (full marriage equality). That isn't unique to this issue. It's not unique to Obama or to Clinton or really to anyone historically. Political expediency has always been a reality in some form or another (*even for Leslie Knope occasionally...*). 

If you want more historical precedence, look at how Lincoln discussed slave rights in his debates versus how he governed. 

We've gone on quite the tangent, but you certainly haven't proved that Clinton is selfish or that everything she does is a political calculation to win the presidency. Even if her worldview was different than Obama's, she could have simply changed her mind (as much of the country did) or altered her view to better reflect the wishes of her constituents. She has a voting record and its consistently progressive. You haven't proved anything with your alleged ""facts and logic.""",1475280552

"startups","t5_2qh26","To shed some light on this here's why they do this. (We do this as well).

1 - With a paid course, users get more ""perceived value"" than a free course.

2 - If they're profiting off the funnel, they essentially just built themselves a huge runway of leads by arbitraging the money they earned from the courses to pay for more acquisition. This is assuming the course directly also upsells their customers into their other product.

So to simplify point #2 - assuming the funnel is profitable, they're essentially making profit WHILE acquiring leads at the same time. This makes it so they can spend more to acquire customers since part of their acquisition costs are now covered by the course. Instead of paying only $10 per lead, they could really pay $100-$200 per lead. When you scale a company's ad spend, this is crucial because your CPAs tend to increase as you scale up the campaigns.

3 - Assuming the course is very related to their product, they've now pre-qualified all those customers into buying their product. If it's a high end course they've just found their gold mine of customers, aka the high-ticket earners.

The downside to their strategy is 

1 - They have to spend time on content creation (usually a lot of time).

2 - If they don't know how to run FB ads profitably &amp; scale, then the whole system doesn't work.",1475280553

The movie sub doesn't allow links to the largest movie site on the internet? Here's why- nearly all of the user imdb submissions are announcements to films or trivia, and neither are credible from imdb. Projects get shifted around way too much on imdb, and the trivia ranges from baseless fan-fiction to gossipy drama. If your submission is trivia or a film announcement, please find an article about the film somewhere else and submit that. If you're recommending a film, please link to its trailer on youtube. If your submission falls outside of these categories, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmovies) and we'll put this submission back. Thanks for your patience.

Or is it just me? I mean come on Kubo, if you are going to imply Ichigo and Rukia are going to be like Isshin and Masaki.... fucking make it happen instead of trolling us with forced pairings and a terrible ending that makes no sense at all, with [Ch. 686] (#spoiler ""Kazui killing Ywhach with one finger."")!!!

If you are going to bring back the anime, at least do it right and give us fanservice lol.

I'm just saying.

I want IchiRuki to happen.

I want to know what happened to Grimmjow, Yoruichi's brother, Ukitake, Kyoraku, Kisuke Urahara, and who's the new Soul King?

Example: nmap -p 22 --open -sV 10.0.0.0/24

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I would like to help but am kinda not sure I understand your position. 

One thing to keep in mind is that human sexuality is a complicated thing. Sex fulfills a lot of roles and needs and not all of them are linked to relationships and intimacy.

Sometimes it is literally just a release, an ease of tensions. This is why it is possible for asexual people to masturbate or have sex drives.

I think that your trying to place yourselves into categories: liveral ex convert and post lifetime mormon is clouding the issue. There are all sorts of sex drives amongst mormon women of all types. Similar with men.

Instead of focusing on those things or how often your husband masturbates, focus on yourself. What is it you need? What will make sex fulfilling for you? 

Is it the intimacy? Is it the physical release? The connection and closeness? The orgasm? Does your husband's orgasm matter?

This requires introspection of what sex means to you and what you expect from it for your relationship. Your husband's views, needs and goals likely aren't the same. They dont have to match for you to both have mutually satisfying sex lives.

I suggest instead of focusing on what your husband does to meet his needs, you focus on what you need to meet yours and both together come up with a plan to meet them. If he isn't capable of another orgasm, sex can still be on the table.  Exploring toys and sexual touching, mutual masturbation, etc are all things you could explore together.

For the 400m sprints, do 4-6 repetitions twice a week. Try to get a little faster each time. I like to take an average of my times and write it down. When I started, I was doing 4 laps, 1:35+ Per lap. Now, I do six at 1:15.

Another thing people say works is to find the pace you want to run at, and run at that pace as long as possible, even if it's just 800m. Each week, try to extend, even if it's half a lap.

Push your petty agenda elsewhere, because this isn't the time or place. There are plenty of forums for discussion with people who are actually interested in a vegan lifestyle; go there. Nobody wants your bullshit here, unless you choose to play by the rules of *this* place. The very first of which is *don't be a dick*. Are you so stoned or stupid that you can't understand those four simple words? Please enlighten us to the answer to *that*, which is actually of interest to at least one of us.

OR, how about you take the energy you put into trashing the lifestyles of others and *actually further your fucking cause?* Go rescue a cow, or purchase a goat intended for slaughter. Volunteers your time on a soy farm in order to maximize efficiency and costs and drive the asking price of the crop down. Write your elected representatives, and ask them to lobby on your behalf...Basically, do pretty much anything but sit on your fucking ass and be a dick to people on the internet.

We're learning more now about the victims of Del Valle's latest double homicide. Today the Travis County Sheriff's Office identified the bodies found off Pearce Lane in Southeast Travis County as Rene Rodriguez and Salom√≥n Segura Perez. And the sheriff's office confirms the men were killed.

Neighbors are reluctant to talk about the crime. They say the killer is still out there.

None of the neighbors we spoke with wanted to be interviewed on camera, but we did find people who knew and loved the two victims.

They cared enough to setup a makeshift memorial on the site where they were found. And they paused to say a prayer for them.

They also wanted to quash any rumors that the men were involved in drugs. They described them both as accomplished craftsmen in home construction and said Segura Perez commanded top dollar for his flooring work.

But they worry the fact he had just gotten paid may have led to his death in this rural area. That's important information sheriff's investigators need to know. Spokesperson Kristen Dark says, ""Any information, even the smallest detail sometimes is the detail we need in order to solve a crime like this.""

This double homicide comes just weeks after four men were discovered dead in a burning house around the corner and down Linden Road. So far the sheriff's office says there's no reason to believe the crimes are related. Still folks in the area don't want the killers to know they might know something about what happened.

But the sheriff's office says you can tell them what you know without revealing your identity. Dark says, ""You can be anonymous when you make that call. People are not going to know who you are. And it would help us greatly to have the information.""

If you don't want to call the sheriff's office you can pass along your information to them anonymously through Crime Stoppers. Their tip line number if 512-472-TIPS.

According to your statistics, apparently the men of this word just don't give a shit about wanting to raise their kids. 

The difference between the statistics that I provided and the one that you stated above is this.. I didn't pull those stats out of my ass.

Also, it really pisses me off when you say men don't sacrifice their careers for family. Just going to work every day, working jobs they hate just so they can provide for their families IS A SACRIFICE. You act like women have it soooo much harder and sacrifice so much by staying home rather than focusing on careers. How is their sacrifice any more important than men sacrificing their time, blood, sweat, physical health, working 8-10 hour days just to feed their kids and give their wife the chance at staying home with the kids rather than working? 

Many women love being able to be SAHM . It's a life that they love. They are blessed by being able to not work and instead stay at home and raise kids and be a homemaker. You act like they are giving up their lives or something but they aren't. Those women chose that life because that's how they want to live. And the only way they are able to be afforded that chance is by their husbands working long enough and hard enough to provide for his family with only one income. 

It's a huge double standard that you act like only the women in these cases are making sacrifices. You completely ignore the sacrifices men make in order to afford their wife to be a SAHM. Don't you think the men would also like to spend more time at home with the kids instead of working themselves to death? Don't you think the men would rather their wives have an income as well so they don't have to work so many hours to make up for it? Don't you think the men also enjoy spending time with their kids rather than working all day long and barely seeing them for a couple hours before bed.

I really can't believe your perspective on this. How you could so easily dismiss the sacrifices fathers make and only place value on th sacrifices women make. 

Guess what, raising kids and having a family is hard work and both the mom and dads have to sacrifice things in their life to make it happen. Who are you to say the men's sacrifices mean nothing while acting like the moms choosing not to work is somehow more of a sacrifice.

Both moms AND dads are heroes. Not just the moms..",1475280578

"Drama","t5_2rd2l","&gt; The RNC and the other candidates could have stopped him, but they didn't because they know he represents the views of a huge chunk of the GOP.

Trump clearly didn't ""represent the views of a huge chunk of the GOP"" considering he won the primary with less than 50% of the total vote and only came out ahead because of open primary states where disaffected democrats and independents could vote in the republican primary.

The RNC and other candidates could have stopped them if they weren't all acting in their own interests.  The only reason Trump won, aside from crossover support in open primary states, was that the party was fractured and had too many candidates to choose from so that the votes split in Trump's favor.  The moderate/Establishment republicans had *Bush III: Electric Boogaloo*, Lindsay ""Nobody wants me but I'm here anyway"" Graham, and Chris ""Does anyone mind if I take the last donut?"" Christie, among others.  The party did everything it could to help these guys, especially Bush, which didn't do a lot of good because the base is tired of business-as-usual, big government republicans.  

The candidates that represented the base did a lot better.  Rubio was in this crowd before the party operatives led by GOP Chair Reince Preibus (clearly the poorly chosen cover name of a lizard person) realized their favored candidates couldn't win and threw the party's support behind Rubio, which sank his chances faster than anything Trump said or did.  The voters didn't want another party stooge as a candidate so Rubio got tossed, too.

The other candidates representative of the base split the majority of the vote, with Cruz doing the best of pack made up of Paul, Walker, Huckabee, and Carson.  If there had only been three candidates instead of nearly 20 (let's say Cruz, *Bush III: The Legend Continues*, and Trump) Cruz probably would have walked away the clear winner.

Trump doesn't represent the views of a huge chunk of the GOP.  One of the reasons he was doing terribly in the polls was that a lot of people in the party were very public about not supporting him in any way.  A lot of moderate/Establishment voters were/are even talking about voting for Hillary.  Trump didn't really secure the support of republicans until recently when guys like Cruz finally came out in support of his candidacy rather than risk a Hillary win.

Trumps support isn't constrained or even ensured by party affiliation.  There are a lot of democrats, mainly blue collar union workers who feel let down by their party, who support Trump.  There are a lot of independents/undecideds who support Trump.  He's definitely not a typical republican candidate, and a lot of republicans aren't happy he's the candidate.  Even many of those endorsing or supporting him admit they do so reluctantly.",1475280581

"redstone","t5_2scnv","How would turning on an improper powering bug be consistent with all other Redstone features? Unlike strong and weak power, quasiconnectivity only occurs downwards from the power source, making it inconsistent. Quasiconnectivity happens when a block is powered because a block adjacent to it would be powered by another block on top of that block. This means that pistons can be powered when they are only adjacent to weakly powered blocks, which shouldn't happen, since weak power can't be transferred to adjacent blocks. MAYBE if quasiconnectivity also happened above and to the sides of the power source, it would be reasonable. But it doesn't. Quasiconnectivity isn't consistent with any existing redstone rules and only applies when the power source is above the quasi-powered blocks, which makes no sense, since both weak and strong power affect all directions. And only 4 blocks are affected by QC: the 2 pistons types and droppers/dispensers. Redstone lamps, doors/gates, note blocks, and all other redstone components are not affected by this bug because they check for power properly. If QC was consistent, it would apply to other redstone components as well. I suppose they could make it a gamerule, but I think the last thing we need is for their to be 2 different sets of redstone rules in the SAME edition. :P

But all that aside, yeah, it is pretty much impossible to make observers consistent across versions without either dumb band-aid ""fixes"" or rewriting the entire redstone code.

For Tacos go immediately to La Mexicana in Newport Ky. Everyday if you can.

For Korean try Riverside in Covington. Great place.

For Gyros that place at Findlay is by far the best. If not that, I recommend downtown at Al Amir (vine st just north or fourth).

For Chinese try downtown at The Orient.

For Vietnamese Pho Lang Thang is at Findlay, but also really great is Le's Pho &amp;Sandwiches on Court Street downtown.

Definitely also head to Cuban Pete's on Court Street as well.

I am a picky pizza person also and have not been satisfied really. We make do with Dewey's and Mellow Mushroom. For fancy pants pizza, go to A Tavola in OTR, and that is pretty legit. I also enjoy cheap-good pizza at Cincy by the Slice in OTR.

"TowerofGod","t5_2t4sj","&gt;If bobbon is so great why did she get caught? What if an attack lands on bonbon before she can activate it?

Why are you asking me this question? Why would Androssi not be able to teleport out of Kaiser's Chamber? Uh, what about the fact that Kaiser is an Anima and her ability is: summoning a Spiritual Wolf? Kaiser's Spiritual Wolf can bite through Ranker's skin and it's undetectable into it tries to chomp a person that it's pursuing. If that wolf bit Androssi, then she wouldn't be able to teleport out of battle because she would be forced to fight Kaiser or she'll bleed-out. 
Since the only way that you can heal from that attack is by killing Kaiser or Kaiser healing you. 

Perhaps Androssi did get bitten and lost the battle, and then Kaiser used her power to treat Androssi, for some reason. Like when she used her Wolf against Inieta, and he had been shown to have no visible wounds either. Or maybe Androssi used Bonbon to evade that Wolf's powerful bite and then lost to Kaiser's second ability.  

Bonbon doesn't seem to appear into it's activated. You can say the same thing about Baam's Thorn. *'What if an attack lands on the Thorn?'* Even if Bonbon could become attacked, it wouldn't get destroyed. It was able to withstand the magnitude [of this attack,](http://prnt.sc/cnyeba) remember? Also, that was only 1/10 of the designed power it could supposedly handle. Since it was able to endure that massive power seamlessly, Kaiser's weapons should not have enough attack power to break it. 

&gt;Yes it seems to take at least a second to activate. When she used it in a fight she had to grapple someone. That second seems too much in a fight with people that fight with the incredible speeds that we see.

That's a complete assumption. It may look like it takes a second to activate for you, but to me, I think it's just SIU drawing out the scene to show what's happening. None of the characters so far have reacted fast enough to stop her before teleporting to some point in a place. If it takes too long to activate Bongbong then why couldn't Lilial stop Androssi from using it? She is a Princess, and Princesses possess tremendous physical capabilities like speed. With such incredible speed that almost no other regular in their Ranks can match, she should catch-up to Androssi before she uses Bongbong as you think, right? Well, who do you believe will win that battle &amp; how? What use will Bongbong provide?

&gt;In the workshop battle she didn't seem to have used Bonbon all that much, still she ran out of energy.

She was mostly using it to teleport to very far distances. She had also used it to teleport other people too, which consumes more of Bonbon's energy.

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","&gt;Yes, that's right. It does make sense. You bought a product with DRM. If you don't like it, don't play PC games that don't say they're DRM Free. Stick with GOG for your gaming and you'll never have problems with DRM during all of your frequent internet outages.

the thing is nowhere on the steam page dose it mention Denuvo , if your the average consumer you don't know about these DRM , there should be a some sort of indication that it uses Denuvo  




&gt;If a game isn't available on GOG, you can either suck it up and realize that once in awhile you might not be able to authorize the game after a hardware change or new install, or just choose not to buy the game. It's not a life-altering, difficult choice. You suck it up, or you walk away.

"linux_gaming","t5_2r2u0","Valve is being subtle, and it's hard to see what they're doing to promote SteamOS and Steamboxes, but doing it they are.

There are a lot of possible explanations for this. A number of them involve potential high-level deals, cross-promotion, exclusivity, and backing by Valve, Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, one of the publishers that has its own online DRM, or someone else.

Streaming content is probably being held up by DRM concerns, and DRM is tied closely to drivers. It's easy to imagine that content owners are satisfied with HDCP and a PS4, XBoxOne, Android or Roku but won't authorize a non-browser player for SteamOS or Linux.

Hardware cost is what it is when machines are open hardware and can't be subsidized. Remember that you can't install a new OS on your modern console but you can install whatever you want on your Steambox. AMD's cost-effective Polaris GPUs and upcoming APUs will probably bring some attractively-priced options to a Steambox market that's been dominated by expensive and mediocre Nvidia mobile chips.

Obviously this doesn't work for all situations. For instance, legitimately terrible things that happen in my/a close friend's life will still stress me out, but in a different way. But, when things such as an unexpectedly bad result come out, I choose whether it stresses me out, depending on if I think that it will help me do better next time.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; That is a very limited view on what life is all about. 

It's a view that leads to better societies and happier people, so I'm going to keep espousing it.

&gt;This could be because millennials do not have the wealth to be married or pursue family units, however there are tax benefits to marriage that should strengthen the financial well being of both parties.

Getting married takes a certain amount of capital. You have to have your own place, so the millions of millennials who still live with their parents are out. All of the societal expectations that come along with Marriage are not cheap (ring/wedding/party).

&gt;And the countries that we look to as models for proper wealth distribution (especially the EU and Canada) all have lower childbirth rates per woman than America.

Millennial unemployment is even worse in the EU than it is in the US. Naturally, they have even lower rates and marriage and childbirth.

&gt; Wealth does not seem to be a factor for large family units in other countries. (Anecdotally we see the poor typically have bigger families here in America)

Poor women have lots of kids out of wedlock. No offense, but that is not what I mean when I say family. It neither achieves happiness nor productive societies.


&gt;Americans are still marrying and breeding more often than other countries with better wealth distribution.

Not true. Millennials in EU have even fewer opportunities, and get married and have kids less.

&gt; Millennials don't want to get married because it is no longer about economics, but about love. Unfortunately this is at odds with accumulation of wealth because marriage has many benefits.

Agreed that it is not the only cause. But it does hurt.

&gt;Wealth redistribution is going to need to be done through smart financial policy that includes better tax incentives for buying a home, socialized healthcare, and minimum wage increases.

LOL. The solution is not to give people things. The solution is eliminate pernicious ideologies like ""everyone needs to go to college"". If anything, we need to decrease the social safety net. Families are a built in way to mitigate risk. If you increase the dangers of society, you'll incentivize people to form families.",1475280594

Because if your not understanding its use on a level of principal, a safe guard to have in place to prevent its possible occurrence and give our elections a certian integrity, your never going to. It's unfortunate.

Failing hard? Hahaha! It was our government that put it in place. Our elected officials that passed it. Our federal government that is keeping it in place. 

Your the one that's failing to see that the majority of people voted for these officials to be in office. If you didn't like the bill you've had over 5 years since Walker signed the law into place that was created and passes the Wisconsin legislature, who the majority of our great state voted for.

We the people. America is, has and always will be a majority rules country. The fact that you need to take a whiff of is the majority of Wisconsin wants this.

"csharp","t5_2qhdf","I don't know the _best way_ how to fix this, but your call to `.WithParameter(new TypedParameter(typeof(IContainer), _container))` is eagerly evaluated before your `_container = builder.Build();` line, so `_container` is `null` at that moment.

A dirty fix would be to change the parameter to `Func&lt;IContainer&gt;` and pass in a delegate that can be evaluated later in the constructor.  For example:

    public MenuFactory(Func&lt;IContainer&gt; container)
    {
        _container = container();
    }

And your building code might change to include something like: 

    .WithParameter(new TypedParameter(typeof(Func&lt;IContainer&gt;), () =&gt; _container))

Might need to do some other tweaks, but the point is to defer the `_container` evaluation until after it's instantiated/created.

The author fails to mention that the tradition which Popper inaugurated is richer than a single idea of falsifying results, if one takes into account the work of both Lakatos and Feyerabend (whatever you think of the latter). Verification and falsification are part of what Lakatos calls scientific methodological research projects, a conception of science which takes nothing away from but actually enriches the variety of possible experiments in any discipline. Which model wins out depends not merely on the Baconian experimenta crucis nor on some decisive paradigm shift (or epistemological break as the Bachelard calls it) but on a combination of all these factors. It seems that it is not philosophy which aims for truth but scientists who believe in a truth out there (ala x-files).

But in this context, a guy is trying to sell footage of the incident (by the way, isn't that fucked up?

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","My advice as a parent of two is to not buy new items.  Go online,  go to a consignment shop,  a thrift store something.  Kids grow out of clothes fast.  Buy a size or two ahead and store it. Same with diapers.  Don't buy newborn diapers.  If your baby wears them it will only be for a few weeks.  Also when people ask what they can give always say diapers,  wipes or gift visas. Tell them if they need to buy clothes for the munchkin buy anything but newborn and to consider the season the child will be in that size.  From a budgeting standpoint and as a previous teen mom,  I would recommend taking a hard look at what you do for fun and impulse shopping.  You need to honestly ask yourself and your SO ""do we need it"" expensive makeup? No. soda? No? A coffee everytime we go out? No.  Buy in bulk and cook your own meals! Don't get the boxed crap,  don't get the premade items. It seems cheap at first but it isn't.  Also if at all possible see if she would be open to getting a part time job on your off hours after the baby is a bit older.  Save the money and she can have some time out of the house.

There won't be evidence to convict people of rape without extenuating circumstances, such as a witness or some type of evidence being present to prove a case.

Male responsibility to judge intoxication levels is equal to female responsibility to judge intoxication levels.  Having sex with someone that is passed out is obviously wrong, it's wrong in both directions equally.  Lack of consent is passive consent in most cases, a verbal ""no"" or some other form of refusal needs to be made to express withdrawl of consent.

Most of this is only an issue in a hook up culture.  People in longer term relationships don't have the same concerns as people engaging in one night stands.  ",1475280600

What's typical I tend to think through our education we are open for the experience, but we are fully aware of the risks involved. So like myself I tried quiet some drugs as well just to see what it's about and that's it. Other then weed and X which I used for maybe a year long in highschool, nothing else I've done again. Now here is where support comes in, I do have a friend who sort of has a knack for addictions and he gets fulltime support from an NGO specialized in addicts. 

I tend to think this is actually the best thing to prevent drug abuse, proper education and proper aftercare.",1475280603

"Fencing","t5_2r6ai","Foot touches are so much fun! I probably do them too much, but a good one is so satisfying. There's a few steps to foot touches. 

First, get the action down. Don't do some slow ass touch where you aim the blade then lunge like you're in a 19th century salle. You need to drop. Fast. There should be no warning, no aiming when you do a proper foot touch. Also you don't have to go forwards that much for a foot touch. You need to go down. When I do a good foot touch my chest gets so low that it touches my knee. Oh and stretch your hamstrings. If my hamstrings start tensing up it's time to stop with the foot touches. 

Second, get the distance down. If at any point you feel the distance is off, don't do the touch. It's so so easy to get punished in the middle of a toe touch. I get fucked a lot when I don't pay attention to the distance. Also, there is such a thing as too close for a foot touch. This is actually super important when you're *defending* against foot touches. 

Third, get the tempo right. For me, I usually keep a 2 beat tempo for foot touches. This means, feint feint, then feint foot touch. Usually the tempo is on the front foot. This may take tweaking. Occasionally I do a 3 tempo/4 tempo touch, but that takes more setup. And remember, a foot touch needs to catch the opponent flat footed. If they're retreating, it's not gonna be easy. 

Finally, figure out how to integrate it. If I'm fencing someone who's a little slow, or it's the first foot touch of the bout, I can afford to do a body feint foot touch, but if I'm fencing a faster, smarter fencer and I've already gotten a foot touch or lost one, then I'd go for some blade actions to convince them my focus is on the upper body. You see, most fencers can only hold focus for a short amount of time in a small area of the body. If you threaten one place like the hand, chances are they won't think about the foot too much. So do a few attacks to the upper quadrants, then slip down and hit the foot. One good one is a bind four hit to the foot. If you're nasty bind four flick to the foot. One combo I've been trying to get is flick through blade to inside of guard, then flick to the foot. The flick to the inside of the guard should provoke a parry four, which would be useless when I'm already down at the foot

A few other things: foot touches are great not just when they score, but because they open up more possibilities that your opponent has to handle. Not a lot of fencers are able to keep many situations in their mind. Juggling a potential fleche, hand touch, body feint, feint in tempo and now a foot touch is a tricky situation for a lot of people. If you're defending against a foot touch, figure out the most non committal way of doing it. I pull my foot back while keeping my knee and thigh in place, but others just pivot their foot",1475280606

You go to a race track and most guys there will tell you the proper way to break in a performance motor is a combination of medium and high load runs to get the piston rings seated. An engine is not really broken in until you put the hammer down a few times. Nobody is out there putting 500 grandma miles on high performance race engines before they put them on course.

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","I remember when this case first broke in the news but I had never really been interested enough in the details to pay it any decent attention so I pretty much just always assumed that all the headlines pointing at Amanda and Raffaele being the culprits were valid. 

Then, over the years, hearing about the various guilty/not-guilty back-and-forth, I just figured that it was one of those things where maybe they didn't do it but then maybe they did and we'll never know either way. 

But in doing more in-depth research as of late and now having watched the documentary, I'm pretty convinced of their innocence. They were railroaded by the Italian legal system due to the sensationalism of the case.

That prosecutor wanted them to be guilty, so they were. I mean, come on, he said they showed ""inappropriate emotion"" outside of the scene...Amanda clearly had a pained look on her face and was seeking emotional support from Raffaele with the quick pecks on the lips. Mignini acted like they were full-on making out, getting off on the action or something. 

Even at the end of the documentary, after he spends all of it steadfastly pronouncing how guilty they are, his tone turns ambivalent. He says ""if they are truly innocent, I hope they find peace,"" or something like that. He doesn't even believe they are guilty anymore. 

That DNA analysis was just atrocious. They didn't find the bra clasp with Raffaele's ""DNA"" on it until 46 days later? Under a rug? And that was one of the main factors supporting their case? Yikes. ",1475280615

""If I've never read a book before.... blah blah blah, do you get the point?""



&gt; based entirely on the potential that I will enjoy whatever their video is.

It's not based on the potential that you'll enjoy the video, it's based on the fact that you WATCHED it. Your enjoyment is irrelevant, you still ate a piece of their bandwidth and used an ad-supported website that needs to make money while keeping the content free. Just like buying a movie is not based on the potential that you'll enjoy it, it's based on the fact that they have a product, and you are spending money for that product

And the creator of online content deserves a large piece of the pie for driving eyeballs to the advertisement (whether you liked it or not)

If you're going to participate in society, you should at least understand basic economic principles. If I had you as an employee, for example, would you be fine with me saying ""I don't think I should pay you. I don't think you deserve to make money for your time spent laboring for me, based entirely on the potential that the labor will assist me in turning a profit.""",1475280616

**Best Anime:** Mob Psycho, Kono Bijutsubu

**Worst Anime:** Re:Zero

**Best Surprise Anime:** Kono Bijutsubu - Very enjoyable slice of life. Humor can be hit or miss, and more often hit (a lot of that due to great comedic timing), but it's pretty light stuff so I don't mind. Probably my favorite slice of life high school anime in a long while.

**Most Disappointing Anime:** 91 Days - The animation quality is so bad, which isn't unexpected coming from Studio Shuka, but it's still very disappointing. At times, the poor animation quality can make things look outright silly and it just pulls you out of things.

**Best Girl:** I'm not really into making lists of waifuable well-written and/or likable characters, but I felt Usami from Kono Bijutsubu was an enjoyable character.

**Best Guy:** Dimple

**Worst Girl:** Every girl in Re:Zero except for Emilia.

**Worst Guy:** Subaru, Felix - wait, that's a guy?

**Best OP:** 91 Days

**Best ED:** 91 Days - I actually really like this one. Somber tone, pretty slow, and it always transitions well at the end of each episode.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","As a Brit, based on my personal experience of Scottish people, i would agree without question that Scotland seems like a cool and progressive country. Although it would be a sad loss for the UK, part of me kind of wants to see you guys break away, because it does seem like Westminster couldn't give a fuck about you (or anyone outside of London fwiw). 

However, even if we leave aside issues such as the budget deficit - doesn't the question of Scottish independence (both in 2014, and in the future) boil down to a question of currency - where if you left the UK you would have to stop using the GBP? I thought that this was the main reason independence failed in 2014. The Euro is surely on a path to crash and burn (even if you were able to join it, as i have heard conflicting reports about whether Scotland meets all the necessary criteria, whether Spain would oppose it etc.). 

I'm genuinely interested if anyone can chime in on this point, because whenever i hear people talk about Scottish independence, this is always the first thought that comes into my head. Is it correct? Or could Scotland leave the uk and still use the ¬£, or are there other options for it beyond joining the Eurozone?",1475280617

"showerbeer","t5_2t7u5","Go to your bottle shop. Pick up a bottle of wine. Any one. Choose one with a pretty label in your price range. Take it home and drink it. Now here's the Important part. Write down the name and the style. Now go to the bottle shop. Pick something different. Doesn't matter what. Just make sure it's not what you got the first time. Drink it. Write down the details. If you're feeling brave, jot down some notes comparing it to the first one. If not, buy another completely different bottle. Drink it, details, notes. When you start noticing a pattern in what you like vs don't like, start researching the grape variety, or the blend, or the brands. See if you can spot flavours or scents in the wines that you like, and chase those across other varieties. its important to read tasting notes at this point because most likely you won't be able to pick out scents and flavours without some suggestion. If you're feeling fun, see if you can find fresh examples of the flavours listed in the notes (peach, red fruits, berries, oak, apple, citrus, resin, etc) and match them to the wine.

For instance, I recognize that in Mormon communities there may be a bias against people not of the Mormon faith, so teaching kids to respect other religions/cultures/customs should be top priority. That's an example of what I would like to discuss, maybe on a new thread (or new group, which I am too new to create). So, in other words, not just pass blame around (which I understand the concern and passion), but come up with ideas that help both sides, so for this example, prevent future suicides. ",1475280621

I have too much respect to do that. But, this summer the dea was looking to reschedule the class of marijuana specifically with regard to medicalmarijuana so institutions could do more research. And we have seen that many children with epilepsy have dealt with the effects of cdc. Many times when the question has been asked of your mother, she has not been as pacific about where she might stand about rescheduling marijuana. I wonder if you have any more information? 00:21:38


&gt;**Chelsea Clinton:**
she has been clear so I am sorry you felt she hasn't been. Please go to her website. One of the challenges with the experiments happeningaround the country at the state level, and she supports states in making whatever decision is right for them, is that we have no real way to study them. So anecdotally we have a lot of evidence in the area you talked about, in epilepsy, autism, in a stimulating appetite for people that are on intensive chemotherapy regimen, for people who have non-epilepsy leisure disorders and challenges, that we also have and it dead -- anecdotal evidence from colorado where some of the people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the corner believed after they die that there was drug interaction with other things they were taking. One of the reasons we need rigorous studying is that we want to know where it works and where it does not because probably there are some areas where it works and areas where it does not. One of the reasons the fda has such rigorous testing and one of the reasons our fda approval process is the gold standard for the world is the rigorous study of new drugs and how they interact with over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs. That is why when we get a prescription, there are warnings . Some are really explicit instructions. If you are taking these four rugs, please note your doctor knows that before you start this prescription. We just need so much more data than we have so that people who might benefit have a chance to benefit. People who might be in danger are protected. My mom strongly support the need for more rigorous study and addressing everything that may have medicinal purpose.

Segun from World War Z (and pretty much all the characters from the book)

Sister Act 2.  The first movie doesn't qualify, but there is no romantic subplot at all in the second movie, and it's centered on a high school class.  Whoopi Goldberg and Lauryn Hill would be the main female actresses, but all the nuns also count.

Wendy and Lucy:  Story of a homeless young woman who is looking for her lost dog.  

Drop Dead Gorgeous, except for Leslie Miller and a brief flirtation scene with Kirsten Dunst's character and a guy that doesn't amount to anything, because circumstances.

Now and Then: two of the four main characters are never seen doing anything with guys, either as preteens or as adults.  One of them is especially known for being flirtatious but you don't see her engage in any romantic behavior on screen.

School of Rock.  Nothing except a little bit of flirtation between the headmistress (Joan Cusack) and the guy without a shirt, but you don't know if it goes anywhere afterwards.  She seemed a bit clueless about it.

Alice Kingsley in the Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland movies, if you don't count the family pressing her into a marriage she doesn't want.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Ironically, I can't quite seem to focus on the long wall of text you wrote because I have ADHD...  but I think you are trying to come to terms with the possibility that both you and your SO have ADHD?

Only a qualified doctor and physcologist/ psychiatrist can diagnose you with ADHD after eliminating other possible medical conditions and reviewing your history and symptoms but that being said...

1. Experts thinks that somewhere between 5-15% of children have ADHD (whether or not those with ADHD are actually diagnosed or even get proper treatment is another story). As almost 50-75% of children continue to have noticeable ADHD symptoms as they become adults... I guess your spouse and yourself are part of that 5-15% of the population have ADHD.

2. I'm assuming you are a woman? but women tend to be diagnosed later on in life due to ADHD having 3 different forms- one is the more noticeable ""bouncing off the walls"" hyperactivity for; the other having a more ""space cadet/ distracted/ off in your own world"" inattentive form. Or, you fell through the cracks with parents who didn't notice or anti-drug beliefs. Or you had doctors' who didn't believe in ADHD,... there's a lot of reasons it could have been missed.

3. Your history- take a look at the DSM 5 or research ADHD to see how your life history matches up with the symptoms of ADHD. The more you learn about ADHD, the more things start to click or make more sense. It's a lot to take it so take a look at our sidebar or other reputatable sources like CADDAC, ADDitude magazine, etc.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I have met plenty of adults ranging 40-70 years old were hooked on diamorphine prescribed by their doctors or who were in the hospital for a long stay. All of them had withdrawals when they tried to stop taking the meds. Some of them kept using the medications because of withdrawals. Some of them didn't know what was happening to them. The others were able to quit but went through withdrawal. A lot of them became 20+ year users of heroin. It's fucking sad to see an elderly addict who is hunched over and can barely walk from old age and doing heroin. The first time I met addicts this old it blew my mind. All of them had a common story. They were injured in a car wreck, fell, or one way or another got hurt. They got on pain meds and when they stopped using them the withdrawal kicked in. They took more meds and felt normal again. The vicious cycle began and eventually they got on street heroin. There is no way around what happens to the receptors in the brain when you're on opiates for extended amount of time. You will get withdrawal whether it's from, diamorphine, oxycodone, vicodin, fentanyl, methadone, etc.. Opiates are opiates. When you quit opiates your brain needs time to start making endorphins again. During this time the brain's receptors are basically in shock screaming for endorphins. It's similar to what happens to someone balls when they are on steroids. The testicles produce testosterone. When you take synthetic testosterone ""steroids"", your balls do not need to make it anymore and so they shut down and shrink. Now when you stop steriods your testicals need time to start working and making natural testosterone again. This is similar to what happens to your brain when you overload it with opiates and then quit. Having a positive environment, support group, or all the love  in the world is not going to stop your body from doing these things.",1475280627

When my wife delivered our first child I got the bill and freaked because I surely did not have the kind of money they were asking.  Upon receiving an itemized statement I discovered that they were attempting to charge us for the stirrups, among other things.  I told them they could either send the stirrups (that I was being asked to pay for) or remove the charge.   They removed the charge.

So first she states that she knows most serial killers are white males and that the victims are predominantly female in real life...then proceeds to complain about that being the case in this fictional skit in a review? Wouldn't this actually make it more realistic?

Also, hate to break it to her, but Mike is a man, he's the one writing the script and performing the character, so no shit it's going to come from a male perspective. Hell, if he'd played a female serial killer, she'd probably complain about the reviews depicting women as crazy and that a man (in this case Mike) speaking for a woman would be wrong in her eyes. It's really a no-win scenario for any person she's criticizing.

As for her issue about the examples of protagonists, fact is the majority of Hollywood films have historically featured white male protagonists. And these are films that the general audience is going to be more aware of, making them useful for the review to make its point. You can argue that this needs to change in Hollywood, and hell we have seen some progress in terms of female leads in action films (in the most recent Star Wars no less), but to chew this review out for not ensuring an equal number of male and female protagonists were outlined when that doesn't impact the point being made?

You've betrayed your intentions entirely with this response now and that is exactly the kind of bullshit feminism goes for. They go around claiming ""Oh men aren't allowed to express their feeling, wah wah"" which actually isn't as big of a problem as they claim then usually within the same breath attack men who talk about real issues like child custody, female on male rape and the way the justice system treats men compared to women they immediately go on the attack doing the very same thing they claim they don't. Oh and of course good luck getting any of these types of 'mens' groups to talk about things like false rape accusations, spermjacking or women who try to blackmail men with pregnancy.

&gt; I'm going to ignore the personal attacks because they're childish.

It's funny how people like you always pretend you want to talk civilly and that you don't like people throwing insults at you when you're the one who has been demonising men from the get-go and talking about male behaviour as if it makes them sub-human, if you want people to be civil towards you, don't act like such a cunt to begin with.

&gt; but I think a more accurate description is that it is trying to **deconstruct** the **need** for such a sense of masculinity.

The need for masculinity? It isn't a 'need' it's what drives men biologically and you're trying to get rid of it. You really shouldn't have bothered posting because the more you do I suspect the more you're going to keep on telling me what your views about men actually are.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised since you claim to have insider knowledge of this you are actually one of the morons organising this group or perhaps an ignorant supporter that has no idea what feminists are actually like.

I didn't get diagnosed until I was evaluated for migraines in order to take part in a drug study for what's now marketed as Treximet. Started around 14, my sophomore year in high school when I was pretty depressed and stressed. My friend always had excedrin in her bag and I just kept taking those until my mom realized I wasn't full of shit. I had an episode at the computer once or twice when I was pretty sure my arm was going numb, which I'm sure helped convince her, too. 

After the drug study I coughed up for private insurance (the first provider denied me for a pre-existing condition, HAH) and got on amitriptylene and zomig. I didn't have a true aura experience until about 5 years in, and still didn't see my first neuro for a few more years after that. 

Putting this all together makes me feel like I don't take very good care of myself... Health insurance shouldn't be so goddamn difficult. Prior authorizations, preferred drug lists, digging up old medical histories, limits on abortives, needing to appeal for approvals on shit... fuckin a man. My head just hurts, okay?

This is a lame reference but back when they did the psych test and they said that JHD seems to want to be the leader but can't figure out how...maybe he just got tired of being the side character on IC.

Her greeting is on a comparable level, but lacks the simple punch of Anduin's. I admit, though, this one could easily grow on me because it has potential for creative BM tactics.


The big killer is Tyrande's new threaten emote, ""You will regret this."" The emote itself is already mediocre, but it becomes much, much worse when you realize it removes the most important play in the Priest arsenal: Turn 2 heal opponent's face -&gt; ""The Light shall burn you."" You can still do it with Tyrande, but it's much less impactful than Anduin telling them they're gonna get burned as they unwillingly bathe in the Light.


This is going to require more testing because we haven't had enough time for the BM meta to truly settle, but at the moment I plan to stick to Anduin for my emoting needs.",1475280635

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","&gt; It's possible, but who would want to sit around doing that job for free all the time and how is that person qualified enough to be deciding what to cover, how to cover it, etc...

I do, I've been working on game engines for 10 years - every day I think about these problems and create library after library - improving them along the way. Nothing makes a person qualified for something like this - it takes one person to start it - it should be community driven. My needs for a library could only account for 25% of the functionality that really should be offered for that library to be several times more successful.

&gt; No two people are going to program something the same way. If you're going to allow, for example, 10 people to work on the implementation of A* in say Java, then you'll end up with 10 different implementations.

I plan on having high-level description for non-technical and those looking for documentation AND low-level description that walks through the equations and algorithms - and how all the variables affect the algorithm.

&gt; Sure, some might overlap, but they'll have different levels of documentation, code style, indentation, and implementation.

The Specs will have a proposed API - if an implementor follows that they won't need to document anything - its part of the Spec. The strength of the Spec is that the implementor doesn't need to spend any time on design or documentation - that's all been done. The API will ensure the code style is consistent - the indentation isn't that important. The implementation will be defined in the low-level details.

&gt; You're not going to get 10 people to agree on which implementation is the ""best""/one to use and if you've got a central person deciding which implementation of the bunch is to be used, then you'll inevitably piss off a few contributors when they think the chosen implementation is a bad choice and they'll just up and leave.

Agreed - I've worked with JPA which is a Spec - and there are multiple implementations. There's the reference implementation (RI) which says ""Implementation A is what we suggest"" however another implementation is typically the better one. I think the determining factor for which implementation is the RI is the one that is more close to sticking with the Spec - after all what's the use of the documentation and content in the Spec if the implementation ignores it? Deciding a RI should not be political like it often is.

&gt; Ignore first-class functions and write the solutions without them unless the language actually requires it for some reason. If someone wants to use them in their implementation based off-of the ""spec"" implementation, then they can go right ahead.

Agreed, that was a horrible example on my part.

None of the games mentioned in this thread have always-on DRM. Almost all of them require authorization every month or so, at install, and if you make major changes to your hardware.

As somebody with spotty internet, you need to deal with it: wait until there's no outage to upgrade your graphics card or install a new game (necessary anyways for 99% of games). You also have to remember to put Steam or Origin or UPlay in Online Mode once in awhile when the internet is working.

Alternatively, you need to get a phone with a Data Plan. Authorizing games uses very little data, so you can probably get by with the cheapest available data plan. Then, even when your common outages happen to coincide with the need to re-authorize a game, you can do so.

3DS is a great system for people in our situation... You can just close it and progress freezes until you open it again. The portable nature makes it easier to put in 10-15 min here and there. There are lots of high quality games available.",1475280638

"DC_Cinematic","t5_2ykm6","Ill wait for the second trailer to determine that. 
WB/DC have mostly had major problems in the post production side and that is usually reflected in the 2nd trailer (in my opinion at least). BvS had that polarizing 2nd trailer which showed elements that would end up weighing down the film, SS had a 2nd trailer most people enjoyed.... when I watched the Blitzkrieg bop one, I just felt like it was just a bunch of flashy action with some cool music over it and lacked any real sense of substance. I just went..... what is the actual point of the movie, and it was a classic case of this isnt showing much of the story or villain as there isnt a whole lot to it. 
But even though I come across as quite of a pessimistic, I was just trying to be as ""objective"" as I can, since I actually really enjoyed BvS and loved the UC. And SS was a messy yet somewhat entertaining summer blockbuster movie with a diverse cast that came out at the perfect time, so even though I didnt love it, I understand why its doing well in the BO and there are people who love it.
So yeah, I am actually genuinely expecting WW to be good or even great, I know there were a couple of ""rumors"" that WW is a mess, but i think they are false and I have faith in Patty Jenkins.

If you have known someone for years, fully trust them, and it is a small job like a $2k website or similar, yes - a written contract is fairly unnecessary, unless it makes you feel better. It certainly isn't worth losing business over IMO in that situation.

Bear in mind that there is such a thing as a verbal contract, or if agreed via email, that also can consitute a contract. You don't have to write out a 2000 word contract document to be protected by contract/civil law - that is a myth.

Many people who own dogs do not realize that while the dog is *their* best friend, other people may not have the same perception.

Even if you managed to fashion up a catapult that threw people really high up vertically instead of obliquely, such that the parachute actually had enough time to open and then you could glide over the wall - and ignoring for the sake of argument how big and very non-portable such a catapult would have to be - you actually need to acquire the parachute, and the cheapest used ones I can find from a cursory Google search cost a thousand US dollars each just for the canopy.

And *then* you have to train people to use them, because it's not just about pulling a string and going ""wheeeee"" as you effortlessly glide in the direction you're facing.

Compare this to just tossing a big rock with a rope tied to it on the other side and having people climb the wall - or just using grappling hooks so you can eschew the whole ""throwing heavy things over the wall"" thing altogether - and the catapult idea starts looking like something thought up by Wile E. Coyote.

Bottom line is, unless you have someone guarding *every* section of the wall *all* the time and actively preventing people from climbing it, a wall just sitting there is never going to be effective at stopping anyone.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","I have a fantasy species from a world/realm/dimension separate from Earth. They have a religion or belief system with a creation story, which may or may not be true, but their deities (the Umbras) are true beings.

Presently there are 6 Umbras, including the Prime Umbra, basically the equivalent of God:  
Dren'u - The Prime Umbra, who covered the dessicated lands of Penumbra from the unforgiving glare of the Sun.  
Razuusta - Indulgence, Revelry, and Self-Gratification  
Aesurinumat (subject to change) - Justice, Truth, and Secrets  
Vaas‚Äôi‚Äônu - Stormbringer, Giver of Life, and Fertility  
Kaluuz - War, Discord, and Mischief  
Ussu‚Äôra - Death, Dreams, and Pestilence

I am unsure if I will add more to the pantheon, but for the time being I am focusing on how the Kaesci honour and celebrate these Umbras. Religion is not a huge factor in their lives - the Umbras do not demand tribute and the Kaesci stress living life to the fullest because as far as they know it's the only one they have. So, while they don't believe in devoting one's life to worship they still do celebrate and pay their respects to the Umbras.

For Razuusta, they have a festival creatively named Razuustan which is essentially an excuse to get drunk and have relations with others. They will also take turns telling (read: drunkenly yelling) an effigy of Razuusta about how awesome they are, their achievements, etc. This is also something they can do whenever, not just during Razuustan.

My question is here... what may be some other practices or events they may have to celebrate the other Umbras? If needed, I can divulge more information about the nature of some of the Umbras, but I haven't fleshed too many of them out at all - they are somewhat hands off entities.",1475280647

Always try to better your form for everything especially just your fighting stance cause once you get it the right way you will feel the difference and always work on the things that you struggle with more than the things you pick up easy if you wanted to take boxing more seriously and wanted to compete I would recommend going to train more often I train 5 days a week and found a great gym where my trainer is really anal about my form and etc very technical I have progressed tremendously with his help that's why I always recommend looking at other gyms if your trainer isn't always critiquing your form",1475280647

You're also looking at a guy who has played in the league for 20 years and not one time has someone come out saying they saw him juicing. Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, Andy Pettitte, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, all caught or forced to admit because someone ratted them out. Why hasn't anyone done that to Ortiz?

The risk then is that if the Vikings lose then the negative score could seal my fate. 


I have Dixon because of the hype train but also after doing some good research. I think he has the talent to actually do really well week 6 onwards and I could flex or trade him given the RB hell we are having. My other RBs are Miller, Freeman, McKinnon, and Matt Jones, so I'm not too shabby in that position right now and would use him to try and get a good WR (probably would add the Eagles D, or Carolina to that trade).

All in all I think that if it comes down to Monday and I'm just 4 points or so behind, then I'll drop the Eagles D (sadly so, I think they will be picked up whilst Dixon wouldn't).

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","&gt;PBS is funded indirectly by Congress through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB; which funds both PBS and National Public Radio). For fiscal year 2010, $281m out of CPB's $422m appropriation went to public television, $210m to local stations and $71m to PBS directly (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub...). In 2010, PBS had revenues of around $570m (http://www.pbs.org/about/media/a...), meaning federal funding via CPB accounted for about 12% of PBS 2010 annual revenues. Note that some of that federal funding for local stations will also make it back indirectly to PBS in the form of programming fees, so the total percentage could be considered higher. source:https://www.quora.com/What-portion-of-PBS-funding-comes-from-the-federal-government

I've always disagreed with libertarian values, but I've also thought that their candidates were at least a little more put together than Johnson.  I'm not even totally sure that he is a libertarian. Take this line from the article. Johnson was asked if 

&gt;But Johnson's habit of coming off as amateurish isn't limited to questions of foreign policy. During a friendly Fox News town hall held last month, Johnson‚Äîflanked by VP candidate Weld‚Äîwas asked whether he supported anti-discrimination laws that prohibited Christian bakers from refusing to sell cakes to gay weddings.

&gt;""I think that supporting discrimination is the wrong thing to do,"" Johnson replied.

&gt;""The Muslim entrepreneur must sell pork?"" host John Stossel asked.

&gt;""You don't have to sell pork!"" Weld interjected, which is the correct answer‚Äîin America, you can sell any legal product you want, you just can't choose not to sell to someone because you're prejudiced. That's not just a Libertarian view. It's a fairly simple legal concept.

Maybe he can have a gaffe on foreign policy, and I can forgive it because he doesn't think we should be as involved in foreign affairs. But it's like he's never thought about any of these basic policy questions that have been so relevant over the last few years. Remember his debacle with child vaccinations? It was the same story.

There's no need to be a jerk and make their day worse. If you want to be polite and ask if they want to hear your opinion on why you aren't voting for Hillary, go for it, otherwise, just ask them to put you on their do-not-call list (which they _should_ have if their system is anything like the one we used for Bernie). Often with Bernie phonebanking, people wouldn't actually put someone on the do-not-call list even if they expressed disinterest, so if you don't want to be called, make sure you specifically request that.

"ModernMagic","t5_2xs5t","On turn 3, with 4 mana, I want to be ramping to 6 mana to kill them, every time.  I run coursers as the only non-ramp / non-bolt / non-win condition in the deck.  I feel like casting her on 4 mana is going to have her kill a creature, die, and then on turn 4 I sit there and can't cast anything useful instead of casting a prime-time/summoning trap.

I mostly play MTGO so 4 bolts as a local meta call is fine.

I'm not sure how 1 emrakul and 4 summoners pact is a virtual 6 emrakul or a virtual 6 breach targets.  Pact and Emrakul have no interaction.

My wincon makeup is:
2 summoning trap
4 breach
3 summoners pact
3 emrakul
4 Primetime

with 2 more trap in the board for the control matchups - they come in along with my 3 baloths because in the control matchup I DO want that 4 drop that can threaten the game, but I don't think there is enough respectable control in the online meta to maindeck 4 drops to fight it.

I think Chandra would be a lot better if you have a full set of bolts AND a full set of incinerate-type burn spells so you could plus her and protect her/you, but that would eat too many slots from ramping/winning.

Emrakul gets around so much hate for the deck that that's why I think its worth running them.  The only card in the format that interacts with it when you time it properly is ensnaring bridge.  Occassionally you'll have to trap in one during the opponent's combat step on turn 4 and they can kill it with a post-combat lilliana or whatever, but that is exceptionally rare.  Meanwhile it gets around all of the various hate permanents that people have.",1475280675

So its doesn't make what he did okay but if were being honest with ourselves - a lot of what happened during the early 70's was wrong and I'd be willing to bet a lot of our own relatives were passively engaged in such lewd behavior either consciously or subconsciously. 

It's this idea that somehow context and due process doesn't matter anymore. This lack of distinction should be concerning to anyone today that has ever been accused of something to which looks bad on the surface.

The worst case is that we actually COULD deprive ICANN of the IANA role, causing havoc as the RIRs and AS'es start squabbling over what network will operate the canonical bgp table.  Maybe they rally behind someone.  Maybe they don't and we start to see actual address overlap and routing errors, the sort of technical problems we hammered out back in the 90's when the networks assimilated to the current bgp system.

"ControlProblem","t5_39qub","I wrote some notes of his main points while watching it. Idk if anyone will find it useful but here it is:

Pathways to machine intelligence: brain emulation, statistical learning

* If we manage to simulate brains of small animals, we will be able to scale up quickly.

* Broad probability distribution of whole brain emulation (WBE) arrival, probably not soon (20 yrs)

* WBE doesn't require any new genius insights, just improving existing technology.

* We might gain insights from neuroscience and apply them to AI.

* Safety concerns of biological-inspired AI might be similar to safety concerns of animals (require training?). Can't easily debug or see what's going on, brains are messy.

* AI/ML has been borrowing ideas from neuroscience, but not many and not immediately after discovery.

* We are bad at predicting AI, because ""it's all ideas"". Surprises all the time. The solution to AI could be something completely off our radar, but might look obvious in hindsight.

* Statistical learning and big data look like a promising pathway to AI

Intelligence explosion and self-improving AI

* Intelligence explosion (IE) is a possibility, but unknown how likely. If we knew how likely, that would tell us a lot about how to shape future.

* Rapid self-improvement is probably possible, because AIs can rewrite their own source code, run faster, do forms of experimentation that we can't do on our brains

* Evolution is a process which has generated intelligent minds using trial/error. We can probably do better, but how much better?

* Intelligence explosion could actually be ""intelligence expansion"", lots of systems improving. All the planet getting smarter; more smart devices, smart humans, smart machines. Kind of acceptable, could be turbulent and dramatic, but we could also get human values into it.

* Scary form: could have one piece of software that improves itself rapidly. Problem is that it might not have good values built-in.

* Best way to reduce risk of uncontrolled intelligence explosion: research it more, what are the dynamics? Do you just need to modify an algorithm to self-improve, or would the AI need to interact with the world?

* Need better ways of thinking about these problems, science of (super-)intelligence. Fields like this could have lots of low-hanging fruit. A small group of researchers has already found a lot of useful info. Research sometimes has diminishing returns.

* Theories of self-improving systems: economists have studied self-improving systems. We can take ideas from econ and look at them from philosophical/computer science perspective.

* Historically, economic growth has been fairly stable at 2% per year. For some economists, the whole idea of an intelligence explosion is absurd, because that means economic growth is going to go through the roof.

* Endogenous growth models: There might be rapid growth if technology makes it easier to make more technology.

* Why hasn't it happened yet? Why do performance increases level off? Need more interdisciplinary research.

Managing risks

* Society will never be ready for huge changes. Unprecedented changes and people will use wrong analogies (rapture, religion).

* The best we can do is to scan out possibilities and investigate, find out where we need to ring warning bells. We might sometimes be wrong, but that's okay.

* Manhatten Project: could nuclear explosion ignite whole atmosphere, destroy planet? They did the math before actually setting out to do something dangerous, for the first time in history.

* LHC, particle accelerators had similar worries. Physicists developed arguments that it's safe, but complex scientific arguments have a chance of being wrong. In order to demonstrate safety, we should have multiple different arguments for something being safe in order to bound risk.

- Precautionary principle: if you don't know whether something is risky, figure out risks, be cautious. Sensible, but people apply it to avoid doing anything dangerous, even when there could be benefits. Need to be proactionary, balance risks and gains. Our civilization could become too risk averse. We might need to take a few risks to prevent other risks.

It might be more practical to proof a room or small gated area at first, then see how he does with short periods alone, before letting him have free roam of an entire house with things to find and pull down. 

Also, disciplining your dog hours later or the morning after won't be very effective. He won't make the connection. In this situation, I would set him up in a safe room where he would have very little or nothing to get into. 

Re: computer wires, are they behind a desk or can they be taped flush to a desk? If you mean cables running on the floor next to baseboards, yes, there are covers you can buy. It's hard to say since I don't know the layout of your desk and room. 

Tips for the dog park? He doesn't sound ready for it. And it's not a place you go to to socialize an undersocialized, unprepared dog. Some type of small class would be better or learning to play with a good canine buddy or two in the yard. If he is standoffish and mounts other dogs right away, that's not a good introduction to the dog park. Plus, you say he's standoffish -- I wouldn't put him in a dog park situation, sorry.

Goals for September:

* *Continue C25k* - **Completed** (On Week 8!)
* *Start doing strength training/bodyweights at least once a week* - **sorta..?** lol does Zumba count as bodyweight? Either way I think 2/4 weeks I did do actual strength training at the gym
* *Try a new recipe* - **Not completed** :( I'm literally about to make a new recipe on Wednesday though!
* *Weigh in at 189.0 lbs so I can reach my Summer Challenge goal (Go Team Sandcastle!)* - **COMPLETED YAY**

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","You say move to a city in the flyover states and I agree 100%. I actually wouldn't be surprised if there was a minor population shift to the Midwest where things are super cheap relative to the coasts. If I grew up on one of the coasts and I was living in a 800 sq. ft. apartment even though I was on salary, I would definitely consider moving somewhere cheaper.

There is seriously a point where it gets too ridiculous. At some point the amenities that we all love about the coastal cities does not outweigh the outrageous costs of living. Having a garage, car, yard, space, cheap food/gas, safety, etc. often gets overlooked when considering where to live. My parents are fairly wealthy in Iowa and they just save money and travel ALL the time to badass places and then come back to their very comfortable lifestyle. Now most people won't be able to travel as much as my parents and as extravagantly but you get the idea. Live in a cheap, yet ""boring"" area of the country but save some coin to travel. 

I grew up in Iowa and just moved to St Louis proper and even though I'm in a city, it is basically as cheap as living in a 250k city in Iowa. I spent the majority of my life wishing to get out of the Midwest but I have grown fond of how inexpensive it is here after travelling and hearing of stories from friends who have moved to the coasts. Some of them have already come back to Iowa/Midwest 10 years after HS graduation.",1475280679

If you're gf isn't sure though, I think baked goods are probably the way to go here. Affordable and thoughtful, and I don't think you ever need an excuse to give someone food. Find out what they like, take into account any dietary limitations and allergies, and look up a recipe online.

if it's any consolation, the only time i have a sedative effect is when i take it with the mirtazapine. i'm a recovering alcoholic, so that may have something to do with my increased tolerance, but your provider will likely start you on a smaller dose to see how you tolerate it. it's worth a shot.

"CruciblePlaybook","t5_37lup","I'll second a lot of what he said, and add that Focused Burst is the best jump option, in my opinion. It gives rapid boost to speed on the jump so you can move quickly; don't bother with controlled burst, you won't need it in PvP. Blink is another viable option, but for me, it's just doesn't fit my play style. Focused burst and getting 'tricky' with your floofing (as they described pretty well) really works amazingly. 

Ophidian Aspect is great all around. Transversive Steps are great with a slow reload weapon like Ill Will. Voidfang Vestments are great, as are Nothing Manacles with their respective grenades. Skull of Dire Ahamkara is underrated but good, allows you to use both Hunger and Annihilate, really the best exotic imo for the mayhem modes. 

Void is really the best Warlock for pvp, followed by Stormcaller (especially in Supremacy, it's just fucking dirty to roll over people with the tickle fingers and pick up their crests, so easy to wipe clustered teams). Solar is pretty 'meh' now in pvp, but can be really a ton of fun with Solar grenades, and Sunbreaker gauntlets in the mayhem modes.   ",1475280684

If your dog does something wrong you need to interrupt it during the process. Afterwards, especially hours afterwards, is too late. Your dog will not make the association. Start with short periods of time and work your way up, but if you come home to something broken or messed up, there's no use trying to discipline him. Don't give him access to every room to start, just do one and close doors or use gates to keep him from the rest of the house.

&gt;He won't let women touch him, where men are more okay (still wary)

If he isn't enjoying being touched then no one should be touching him. Strangers don't need to pet every dog that walks by. 

&gt;any tips for taking him to a dog park?

Don't, until he has proper dog manners. Dog parks are not a place to socialize a dog. They are a place for well-socialized appropriate dogs to play with one another.

The email issue has been decided (they're deleted and the FBI decided not to go forward with charges) while Trump is still going against what he has said he would do by not releasing his tax returns like every president has done for the past 50 years.
